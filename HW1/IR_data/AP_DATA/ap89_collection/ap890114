<HEAD>Vietnam Vet Refuses to Prove Citizenship, Loses Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FONTANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dennis Elmore figures he proved he's an
American by serving in Vietnam, so he refuses to document his
citizenship to keep his job.
   That refusal got the 40-year-old machinist fired Friday, the
deadline his boss set for filling out a government form employers
have to keep to prove all their workers are citizens or legal U.S.
residents.
   ``When I was 18 years old, they sent me a draft notice. They knew
I was a citizen then,'' Elmore said.
   His boss, Dick Fisher of S&amp;D Specialties, said he wishes he could
keep Elmore in the $12-an-hour job making parts for hydraulic
cylinders. But if he did, the company would risk a $500 fine for
failing to keep the new form required by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   ``They didn't give me a lot of options. It's a federal law,''
Fisher said.
   The law is part of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of
1986, which extended amnesty to illegal aliens who can prove they're
longtime U.S. residents. The law also imposed the employer penalties
in hopes of cutting the influx of new illegals.
   Elmore acknowledged the government didn't want much: He was
supposed to fill out the form and supply driver's license and Social
Security numbers.
   ``It's a matter of principle, all right,'' he said.
   He ignored the form during the six months he's been working in
this town 50 miles east of Los Angeles. But Fisher decided he had to
set a deadline, and the men agreed Friday would be Elmore's last
unless he did the paperwork.
   Elmore went to Vietnam as an Army enlisted man in 1969 and said
the government should have taken military service into account.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman Ron Rogers in
Los Angeles said the service can't make exemptions for veterans.
   ``Does he want to cooperate and help us control our border?''
Rogers asked. ``He did serve his country, and this is another way of
helping his country.''
   Elmore doesn't have any firm plans for a job hunt. One thing's
for sure: He won't take a job if they ask him to fill out the
immigration form.
   ``I don't think I will,'' he said. ``I really don't.''

<UNK>Italian Researcher Descends Into Cave for Isolation Experiment</UNK>
<DATELINE>CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 27-year-old Italian researcher has begun
months of isolation in a Plexiglas enclosure inside Lost Cave as
part of an experiment.
   ``Ciao!'' Stefania Follini called out Friday as she grinned,
waved and descended a 20-foot ladder.
   Pioneer Frontier Researches and Explorations, an Italian team of
speleologists and researchers under the direction of Maurizio
Montalbini, hopes their experiment will yield knowledge about the
effects of long-term space travel.
   Joining her underground for a brief farewell party were
Montalbini, team physician Andrea Galvagno, U.S. Bureau of Land
Management representative Jim Goodbar, and several friends.
   They shared wine, and Ms. Follini sang a few songs and played the
guitar before her guests left her alone in the cave, and its
entrance was sealed.
   Ms. Follini then began to make herself at home in the
100-square-foot enclosure she had not seen before Friday. The room
in which she plans to study English and practice judo is sparsely
furnished with a red metal chair and a table holding two computers.
It has 400 books.
   The cave is adapted so that Ms. Follini will be isolated from
sound, sunlight and human contact _ even the sound of a human voice
_ for at least four and probably five months. She will be monitored
by a video camera and brain electrode implants.
   Montalbini called her isolation ``a long and lonely
circumnavigation, not of the world, but of a single mind _ your
own.''
   Supplies pack shelves from floor to ceiling. Her bed consists of
several foam pads spread across the wooden floor. Her chemical
toilet is secluded from the camera's view. A five-month food and
water supply are stored in the cave.
   While electrode implants monitor her brain waves, Ms. Follini
will place blood and urine samples in a container to be pulled to
the surface. The samples will be tested for immunology,
endocrinology and hormones at three U.S.-based medical centers.
   Montalbini said the tests would come at random intervals to keep
Ms. Follini from knowing how much time elapses. Officials say an
essential element of the experiment will be her time perception.

<HEAD>Greater Demand Pushing Up Prices, Planting Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising demand and easier federal curbs are
encouraging the nation's wheat farmers to boost production this
year, beginning with nearly 6 million acres more of winter wheat for
the 1989 harvest.
   The Agriculture Department said Friday that winter wheat
plantings last fall totaled 54.5 million acres, up 12 percent from
48.8 million acres seeded for last year's harvest.
   Winter wheat is planted in the fall and harvested the following
year. It accounts for about three-fourths of the total U.S. wheat
output.
   Production was cut last year by drought, and brisk export demand
has helped reduce stockpiles. With greater demand, prices have risen
substantially the past year.
   Also, farmers are being required to idle only 10 percent of their
wheat base acres for 1989 in order to qualify for government price
supports, compared with 27.5 percent previously.
   ``All states increased acreage from 1988 except Arizona, the
Dakotas, Mississippi, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey and Wyoming,'' the
department's Agricultural Statistics Board said in its report. ``New
Mexico and Tennessee are unchanged.''
   In Kansas, the largest producer, wheat plantings jumped 22
percent to 12.4 million acres.
   Nationally, the 54.5 million acres of winter wheat planted for
1989 is the largest acreage since 57.8 million acres were planted
for the 1985 harvest, according to USDA records.
   In a supply-and-demand analysis, officials said the U.S. total
wheat stockpile on June 1, the beginning of the 1989-90 wheat
marketing year, could be whittled to around 534 million bushels,
less than half the 1.26 billion bushels in the June 1, 1988,
inventory. It was more than 1.82 billion bushels on June 1, 1987.
   Export subsidies and other government programs have helped boost
wheat sales to the Soviet Union, China and other foreign buyers.
Total shipments in 1988-89 are expected to be around 1.5 billion
bushels, more than double the 700 million bushels needed to cover
U.S. domestic food requirements.
   Meanwhile, wheat prices at the farm have risen to a predicted
range in the current marketing year of $3.60 to $3.75 per bushel, on
the average, compared with $2.57 in 1987-88 and $2.42 in 1986-87.
   A comparable situation has developed for some other grains hit by
last year's drought. Corn prices, for example, were forecast at an
average of $2.30 to $2.70 per bushel in the 1988-89 marketing year
that runs through August, compared with $1.94 last season and $1.50
in 1986-87.
   Another report showed the Dec. 1 inventory of corn at 7.07
billion bushels, down 28 percent from a year earlier. The wheat
inventory, at 1.71 billion bushels, was down 32 percent from Dec. 1,
1987.
   Soybean stocks as of Dec. 1 were reported at 1.37 billion
bushels, down 22 percent from a year earlier.
   A review of overall 1988 crop production showed relatively minor
adjustments in USDA's previously announced harvest figures, with the
exception of corn. Last year's corn harvest was reported at 4.92
billion bushels, up from 4.67 billion bushels estimated last
November.
   Even so, the 1988 corn harvest was down 30 percent from 1987
production, with the drought-reduced yield averaging 84.6 bushels
per acre, compared with the record level of 119.4 bushels per acre
in 1987.
   The 1988 harvest of all wheat was a decade low of 1.81 billion
bushels, down 14 percent from 1987, and soybeans last year totaled
1.54 billion bushels, 20 percent below 1987 production. Cotton
output, at 15.4 million bales, was up 5 percent from 1987 and was
the most in seven years.

<HEAD>DOT Reconsidering Cutback In Rural Air Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportion Department is taking a second
look at a plan it introduced last month that would force some small
airlines to eliminate unprofitable routes in sparsely populated
areas.
   DOT cited budget restraints when it proposed sharply curtailing
its ``Essential Air Service'' program. Under the program, the
federal government subsidizes flights to and from about 150 small
cities that would probably not otherwise have air service because
the routes are not moneymakers.
   On Friday, Transportation Department spokesman Hal Paris said an
announcement could be made as early as the beginning of next week
about changes in the DOT plan.
   He would not elaborate, but another department official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said: ``There is something under
consideration. There is movement to responding to a congressional
request.''
   He added, ``Nothing has been signed yet, and it's not a decision
until somebody signs it.''
   The original proposal was swiftly attacked by lawmakers from West
Virginia, Kansas and other states that would be especially hard hit.
   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the reductions would be ``a
fatal blow'' to the economic growth efforts of some communities, and
Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said the plan could mean the end of
commuter air service in rural Kansas.
   The original DOT action was in response to a $6.6 million
shortfall in the air service program's appropriation for the 1989
fiscal year.
   The department proposed four likely plans for coping with the
cuts. One of them, considered the harshest by some, would cut 53
cities entirely out of the program. One-third of those cities are
more than 100 miles from the next nearest airport.
   In defending the cuts, the department has pointed to little-used
flights that receive subsidies in remote areas.
   For example, the government spent $379,000 in Georgia last year
to keep flights going between Atlanta and Moultrie that averaged one
passenger. The route would probably be eliminated if the subsidy
ends.
   But Rockefeller said ending subsidies to West Virginia cities
could do more than simply inconvenience passengers who would have to
travel to another airport further away.
   ``For rural areas, there is a direct link between adequate air
service and economic development,'' Rockefeller said. ``One of the
first questions business leaders ask when they come to look at rural
areas is: `What's the air service like?' ''
   In West Virginia, the cutbacks could mean the end of flights in
and out of Beckley, Clarksburg-Fairmont, Elkins and Morgantown.
   In releasing the plan on Dec. 14, the DOT said it hoped it could
take effect on March 1, following a public comment period.
   Exec Express II Airlines, which operates in Texas, said in a
letter to Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas: ``From our standpoint, any cut
in the Essential Air Service program would be devastating. Exec
Express II has been rebuilding air service in communities which have
not had adequate service in the past.''

<HEAD>Reagan, Bush Fight Subpoenas To Appear In Former Aide's Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan and President-elect Bush are
challenging subpoenas from Oliver North, while prosecutors say
North's continued demand to use classified information is an effort
to torpedo his upcoming trial on charges stemming from the
Iran-Contra affair.
   The government filed a motion in federal court Friday to quash
the subpoenas for Reagan and Bush, whose testimony is being sought
by North as part of the fired White House aide's defense.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said North ``has not made the
requisite showing of relevance, materiality and need for
specifically identified information that he seeks to obtain'' from
Reagan and Bush.
   Thornburgh said that in accordance with an offer made last Sept.
28, the president will consider furnishing appropriate information
with written answers to ``reasonable written questions'' from North
and that Bush ``joins that offer.'' North served the subpoenas Dec.
22.
   ``The spectacle of a former or sitting President being subjected
to peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in the
way they deal with the President now and in the future,'' the
government said in the motion to quash the subpoenas for Reagan and
Bush to appear at the trial.
   North's lawyers, meanwhile, served the Justice Department with
subpoenas for Reagan and Bush to turn over various personal papers
for use by the defense, said department spokesman Loye Miller.
   Earlier in the day, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
dismissed the two central charges alleging that North illegally
diverted more than $14 million in U.S.-Iran arms sale proceeds to
the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Walsh had filed a motion Jan. 5 seeking to have the two charges
dropped, citing North's ``insistence on introducing classified
information in his defense'' and the Reagan administration's refusal
to release material the judge ruled that North would need at trial.
North's attorneys said proof of their client's innocence is
contained in classified material.
   Twelve criminal charges remain against North, and the issue of
dealing with classified information in open court remains a problem.
   Attorneys for both sides held closed-door morning and afternoon
sessions with Gesell on classified information as it relates to the
remaining counts. The attorneys will resume the closed-door
discussions next Tuesday.
   Walsh said in a court filing Thursday that the remaining charges
can be tried ``without opening the door for'' North ``to use reams
of classified information'' and that North should be barred from
seeking to prove ``a host of irrelevant matters for the sole purpose
of scuttling the entire case'' by using national security grounds to
do so.
   However, defense attorney Brendan Sullivan said last week,
``classified information pervades the remaining charges as well.''
   Nine of the counts focus on charges that North concealed from
Congress and former Attorney General Edwin Meese III his efforts on
behalf of the Contras. Four of the nine deal with alleged
concealment of a diversion of money to the Cntras from the
administration's secret arms sales to Iran.
   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 security
system at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting to
his own use at least $4,300 in traveler's checks from Contra leader
Adolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenue
in connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.

<HEAD>Verity Says US Products Below World Standards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Outgoing Commerce Secretary C. William Verity
says many American products are below world standards of quality and
the Japanese are two years ahead in developing salable products from
American inventions.
   Blaming antitrust laws for a large part of the problem, Verity
urged President-elect Bush to prepare for ``economic warfare'' in
the 1990s.
   ``What's going to be on the top burner of the 1990s for the Bush
administration is trading, and how is America going to make sure it
will be the number one player,'' Verity said Friday in a last speech
for ``Export Now,'' a campaign he has pressed in his 18 months in
office.
   As President Reagan retires next week, Verity will follow. An old
friend of Bush from the Texas oil industry, Robert Mosbacher, has
been named to succeed him.
   ``The reason that many American products are not selling abroad
is very simple: because they don't have sufficient quality to do
it,'' he said.
   He told how his family company, Armco, Inc., had been a big
supplier of sheet steel to the American auto industry, but had to
work five years to produce steel that would meet the standards of
Honda, the Japanese auto-maker.
   Verity says antitrust laws discourage cooperation of American
companies, creating a barrier to more effective competition.
   ``It (should) be possible for high technology companies or other
companies to get together, not only just research together, but
develop and produce together and market together and then compete,''
he said.
   ``That's what has to happen if we're going to stay in some very
important markets including the semiconductor market ... or high
definition television, or super-conductivity, and there's much more
coming down the path.''
   This country has some marvelous technology, but it is less expert
at transforming theoretical discoveries into products that can sell,
he complained.
   ``The Japanese can do this two years quicker than we can,'' he
said.
   ``This is a serious problem if we develop a technology but if the
Japanese take our technology and use it and we're two years delayed
in getting into the marketplace ... That's going to be disastrous to
this country.''
   Verity's criticism of U.S. industry was not the first from a high
figure in the Reagan administration. Richard G. Darman, who was
deputy to former Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, has
criticized what he called a ``corpocracy'' in American business for
what he saw as lack of initiative.
   Baker is to be secretary of State under President Bush, and
Darman will head the Office of Management and Budget.

   Singer-songwriter Barry Sadler, brain-damaged
from shooting, was ordered Friday to undergo psychiatric evaluation
by a judge who may appoint a guardian for the ``Ballad of the Green
Berets'' singer.
   Judge John Donnelly filed a restraining order preventing Sadler
from being moved against his will from Cleveland, and said Sadler
must be evaluated by Jan. 20 to determine if he is competent to make
his own decisions.
   The judge said he will decide after the evaluation if the court
has jurisdiction to make Sadler's mother his guardian.
   ``If he is competent, maybe we don't need a guardian,'' said
Donnelly, adding that Sadler's 24-year-old son, Thor, would be
allowed to visit his father Friday.
   The 48-year-old author and singer-songwriter, whose ``Ballad of
the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 hit in 1966, is at the center of
competing legal bids from his mother and son to become his guardian.
   A judge in Nashville, Tenn., on Tuesday named Thor as temporary
guardian, but Donnelly said that judge agreed Friday to the
psychiatric evaluation.
   Sadler, who was shot in the head in Guatemala City in September,
checked out of Cleveland's Wade Park Veterans Administration
hospital Sunday against medical advice.
   Sadler left after he learned hospital officials planned to send
him back to a Nashville VA hospital, said his attorney, Joseph
Meissner.
   Thor Sadler said, ``30 percent of his brain was destroyed when
the bullet went through it. ... I don't know if he is capable of
making decisions.''
   Meissner said Friday that Sadler is mentally competent and wants
his mother, Blanche Bebe Sadler, appointed guardian to help him
conduct his affairs.
   A hearing is set in Nashville Wednesday on a petition filed Jan.
10 by Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth, and children, Thor, Baron and
Brooke, asking the court to appoint one of them guardian and return
Sadler to Nashville.
   Guatemala City police reports indicate Sadler was shot by
accident when a gun fell out of his pocket and went off while he was
riding in a taxi, his son said.
   Sadler also is the author of more than 20 books, featuring Casca,
a mercenary con demned to everlasting life until the Second Coming
of Jesus Christ.

<TEXT>
   Authorities have identified Iran as a
possible destination for a planned illegal shipment of nerve gas,
but the final arrival point may never be known, a Customs Service
official said.
   ``We don't have to know (it) to make a case'' against two men
charged Thursday with trying to export the deadly gas, said Richard
F. Mercier, head customs investigator in Newark.
   Prosecutors must only prove that the Korean-American and British
business men tried to circumvent licensing requirements in exporting
restricted materials, he said Friday. The charge carries a maximum
five-year prison term and a $250,000 fine.
   ``I'm hopeful that through investigation, or whatever else,'' the
destination would be positively determined, Mercier said. But he
pointed out that the deal never went through.
   ``It's not as though there's a trail for us to follow,'' he said.
   Authorities said Friday they are trying to learn the identities
of two other people accused of plotting with the suspects.
   Juwhan Yun, 48, was arrested Thursday at what he thought would be
a meeting with an arms supplier, who was actually a Customs Service
undercover agent.
   He has been ordered jailed pending a bail hearing Tuesday on
charges of conspiring to illegally export sarin, a nerve gas.
   An arrest warrant was issued for Charles Caplan, a London
businessman who authorities said was seeking to obtain the gas _ $5
million worth in the form of 500 quarter-ton bombs _ from Yun. The
possibility of his extradition is being studied, U.S. prosecutors
said.
   The complaint filed in federal court accusing Caplan and Yun said
the men met Jan. 9 about the gas deal with two other people in
London.
   ``During the course of the meeting, Yun called the undercover
agent twice and asked him for more detailed information about the
sarin,'' the complaint said.
   The complaint also detailed discussions between Yun and K.Y. Joo,
identified as a close business associate of Yun and the head of
Kwang Jin Trading Co. in Seoul, South Korea.
   Authorities said Yun and Joo discussed at least three missile and
military radar equipment deals that apparently involved Iran as a
destination. Authorities also said that at one point during
negotiations Iran was to be the recipient of the sarin.
   The complaint said that during a meeting Jan. 4 between Yun and
the agent, the agent asked Yun ``if a final destination is the
country with the `I' in it and Yun answered yes.''
   But that could not be verified, said First Assistant U.S.
Attorney Michael P. Chertoff.
   Caplan, identified as president of Domino Associates and Domino
Avionics, was described in British court as a former military
consultant.
   Caplan could not be reached for comment. Messages left at his
London offices were not returned.
   Yun's attorney, Stephen N. Dratch, also failed to return phone
messages.
   Concern over the potential spread of chemical weapons has
intensified recently. At a U.N. conference in Paris on Wednesday,
more than 140 nations reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocol banning
the use of chemical arms.
   Yun's arrest came the same day the West German government
reversed itself and said it suspected German companies helped build
a Libyan plant the United States believes is a chemical weapons
factory. Libya says the plant will produce medicine.

<HEAD>Death Toll Up 352 On Highways With 65 mph Limit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural interstate highway accidents killed 352
more people than a year earlier in states where the speed limit was
raised to 65 mph, while death tolls on other roads decreased
slightly, according to a government report.
   The 19 percent increase in deaths occurred over a period that
varied for each state, depending on when drivers were allowed to go
faster, said the report Friday by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. Congress authorized the increased limit
beginning April 2, 1987, and 38 states have adopted it for their
rural interstates.
   Highway deaths in those states on urban interstates and other
roads where the 55 mph limit remained totaled 21,366 for the same
period in 1986 and 21,231 in 1987, the report said.
   Fatalities in states that raised the speed limit increased by an
average nearly three times as high as in 10 states that kept the
limit at 55 on all roads, the report showed.
   But the safety administration, in releasing the first of three
planned annual reports, said there were ``substantial variations''
among the states and some such as California actually showed fewer
deaths on rural interstates after new speeds were posted.
   The report also said there was not enough evidence to determine
the speed limit's long-term impact on highway safety.
   Critics of the higher speed limit said the increased death toll
was enough reason to return to the 55 mph limit nationwide.
   ``This report can be summed up in two words: speed kills,'' said
Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chairman of the Senate Appropriations
transportation subcommittee, who has opposed the increase.
   Overall, 373 more people died on rural interstates in 1987 than
in 1986, the report said. Of those, 352 were in states that raise
the speed limit and 21 in states that did not.
   The highway safety agency, in its 67-page report, said rural
interstate fatalities account for only 5 percent of Americans killed
in road accidents, and the increase had only a small impact on
overall traffic fatalities which total about 46,000 a year.
   The report noted that 24,000 people are killed each year in
crashes where alcohol is involved and 8,000 are pedestrians hit by
vehicles.
   ``NHTSA continues to believe that setting speed limits is a
matter for state legislatures to decide based on their review of
available fatality and injury data, actual experience and local
conditions,'' the report said.
   It noted that Arizona and New Mexico experienced large increases
in fatalities after raising the limit to 65 but states that did not
also had significant increases. They include Connecticut, Georgia,

   Although Angela Lansbury has insisted she's
leaving the popular detective program, ``Murder, She Wrote,''
negotiations are under way to keep her in the role of Jessica
Fletcher.
   Universal TV spokesman Bob Crutchfield said Lansbury's contract
would expire soon. ``She only came aboard for five years,'' he said.
   Her one-hour show, which debuted in September 1984, has
frequently been CBS' most popular series.
   Kim LeMasters, president of CBS Entertainment, said Thursday that
``heated'' negotiations were being conducted between Miss Lansbury
and Universal TV, the show's producer.
   Last fall, Miss Lansbury said she wanted to end the series to do
movies and return to Broadway, where she won four Tony awards.

   Former President Richard M. Nixon, who
suffered from the Watergate tapes, is at the center of a more recent
taping incident.
   Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez now admits he recorded
a call from the former president last month.
   In California, taping a telephone conversation without the
consent of both parties is a misdemeanor. Vasquez, a former police
officer, acknowledged taping Nixon after earlier denying it, but
said Thursday that Nixon gave his permission.
   He said Nixon knew he was being taped by the telltale beeps
coming from his machine. ``I considered it a private matter, a
memento for me and my family,'' Vasquez said.
   Nixon aide John Taylor said Vasquez never asked permission, but
Nixon knew he was being taped because of the beeping and didn't
object.
   Nixon called Vasquez to thank him for making a speech at the Dec.
2 groundbreaking for the Nixon Presidential Library in Yorba Linda,
30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.

   Pele, the retired king of Brazilian
soccer, said in an interview published today that he quit a
government public relations job to avoid ``lying'' about his country.
   Pele, who retired as a player in 1977, last year resigned as
goodwill ambassador for the government tourism agency Embratur.
   In an interview with the Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil, Pele
said he quit because he was embarrassed by questions about violence
and street crime in Brazil. ``I just couldn't go on lying any
more,'' he said.
   Pele, 48, said the last straw came when Embratur asked him to
promote a Brazilian perfume in the United States. ``I was paid to
defend Brazil and not to sell perfume,'' he said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Ruling Against US News Retirees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE ASSEO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 200 retirees of U.S. News &amp; World
Report have lost another round in their court claim that they were
underpaid $100 million in profit-sharing benefits.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals on Friday upheld a lower court decision
that said the retirees were paid a fair value for their company
stock before 1982, even though employees who held stock when the
news magazine was sold two years later received much more per share.
   The 230 plaintiffs, who retired between 1974 and 1982, were paid
an average of $100 a share, said their attorney, Alan Raywid. The
magazine's 1984 employees got $2,842 a share when U.S. News was
sold, according to court papers.
   ``We think the opinion is wrong,'' said Raywid, who added there
is a ``substantial likelihood'' it will be appealed. The
three-member court effectively said companies ``can sacrifice the
interests of past employees and retirees'' to benefit current and
future employees and maintain employee ownership, he said.
   Under the U.S. News profit-sharing plan, when an employee retired
the company could exercise its option to buy the employee's stock
shares.
   According to court papers, employees who retired in 1973 received
$65 a share, while the value rose to $470 for those who retired in
1981.
   The magazine was sold for $176 million in 1984 to media and real
estate magnate Mortimer Zuckerman.
   Raywid said the plaintiffs had received a total of $5.5 million
for their stock but believed they would have gotten $100 million
more if they had been given full value.
   The plaintiffs contended the company that appraised the
magazine's value improperly classified retirees' stock as a minority
interest rather than a majority interest, which would have carried a
higher premium.
   In addition, the plaintiffs said the appraiser placed an unfairly
low value on property U.S. News owned in Washington D.C.
   However, the Court of Appeals upheld the decision to give the
retirees' stock a minority status, saying it was ``entirely
consistent'' with the profit-sharing plan's rules and with federal
law.
   The court also affirmed the property valuation, saying much of
the land was being used as a parking lot and development had not
been expected at the time.
   A major objective of the profit-sharing plan was the perpetuation
of employee ownership, the appellate court said, adding that the law
does not set an exclusive goal of maximizing benefits.
   ``The plaintiffs were not the only beneficiaries of the plan,''
the judges said. ``Indeed, the worst that can be said of the plan is
that it was administered to favor a rolling class of future
beneficiaries over those present and past.''
   Ruling in the case were Circuit Judges Harry T. Edwards, James L.
Buckley and Stephen F. Williams.

<HEAD>Bomb Threat Against White House Minutes Before Reagan Arrival</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL PAGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Reagan's helicopter landed at the
White House minutes after a bomb threat was received by a White
House operator, an administration aide said.
   Reagan, returning late Friday from New York on the last working
trip of his presidency, landed on the South Lawn on schedule at
11:15 p.m. EST after the Secret Service went over the area with
bomb-sniffing dogs.
   The president entered the executive mansion without incident,
White House press aide Scott Sowry said.
   About 15 reporters and television crew members, on the South Lawn
to cover the usually-routine helicopter landing, were removed to the
White House press office moments before the presidential helicopter
arrived.
   Press officials on duty had no information about the exact nature
of the threat or whether it was actually directed at the White House
complex.
   Reagan was returning from New York, where he had spoken at the
annual dinner of the Knights of Malta, a Roman Catholic civic
organization that helps the poor. It was his last official working
trip out of Washington as president.
   Aides at the White House did not know if Reagan had been informed
of the threat. Secret Service officials could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   ``Several minutes before the helicopter was supposed to land the
White House operator received a bomb threat and passed that on to
the Uniformed Division (of the Secret Service),'' Sowry said. ``When
the president landed, the place had already been swept.''
   Earlier, during Reagan's speech in New York, a man who said he
had a package for the president was detained at the Waldorf-Astoria
while police and Secret Service officials inspected the package and
others in his car.
   No explosives were found. The package he carried turned out to be
a photo album and the packages in the car were personal belongings,
police said.
   Reagan left the hotel slightly behind schedule and by a different
route after it was determined that no explosives were present, said
New York police Capt. Dan McCormick.
   The man, who was not immediately identified, was taken to an
office in the hotel and questioned by police and Secret Service.

<HEAD>Report Urges Colleges To Expand Study-Abroad Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE MITGANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fearing a loss of the nation's competitive edge,
a group of college officials is seeking ways to double the number of
students studying abroad and include more business and science
majors.
   Members of the Council on International Educational Exchange met
privately in New York on Friday to discuss ways to expand
study-abroad opportunities for less-affluent youngsters and
encourage students to attend programs in places other than just
England or France.
   The meeting followed release of a council report in December
which found fewer than 5 percent, or about 50,000, of U.S. college
students studying abroad each year, while some 350,000 foreign
students attend U.S. schools.
   ``Citizens of other nations are learning more about us than we
are about them and each year are doing so in increasing numbers,''
said the 28-page report, ``Educating for Global Competence.''
   ``We have quite rightly welcomed these students to our own shores
but have failed to encourage our own students to go abroad,'' it
said.
   The report warned that failure to expand study-abroad
opportunities would mean ``we will irreversibly diminish the world
status of the United States.''
   Robert L. Woodbury, chancellor of the University of Maine system,
said in an interview that the council decided to establish a
Committee on Unrepresented Groups to help schools develop
study-abroad opportunities for such groups as business and law
students, and poor and minority youngsters.
   ``We plan to get poor students better information on what the
costs are,'' Woodbury said after the meeting. ``There's a common
belief that study-abroad progams will cost more. In fact, many
programs do not involve extra cost.''
   According to the report, only 3 percent of U.S. high school
graduates and 5 percent of college graduates have meaningful
proficiency in a second language. Thirty-three states don't require
foreign language study in high school, and 34 states don't require
world history. The United States is one of the few industrialized
countries where students can graduate from college without studying
a foreign language.
   ``If you look at the attitude of colleges here, international
study has never been a very big part of the curriculum. It's just a
`good thing to do,' rather than a part of the mainstream,'' said
Woodbury.
   The majority of students studying abroad are white, affluent
females from highly educated families, according to the report. Most
are liberal arts majors and spend less than six months in foreign
programs.
   Relatively few students majoring in business, public health,
science or math take part in such programs, said the report.
   Woodbury said his own school started an exchange program with the
Soviet Union in 1987 involving 15 Soviet and 15 U.S. students each
year. The University of Maine system is also trying to establish an
exchange program in which business students could work as interns in
Japanese companies, he said.
   The council, established in 1947, is a non-profit organization
based in New York which fosters student exchange programs. Former
Arkansas Sen. J. William Fulbright serves as honorary chairman.

<HEAD>Cross-Wiring Check Ordered For Boeing 757s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cross-wiring found in cargo hold emergency
systems of two Boeing 757 airliners prompted federal aviation
authorities to order inspections of all the aircraft within the next
three days.
   The order late Friday was similar to one issued for Boeing 737s
48 hours earlier involving critical engine fire and vibration
warning systems. The two ``airworthiness directives'' were
unrelated, however.
   The earlier order was prompted by speculation the pilot of a
British Midland Airways 737 that crashed Sunday, killing 44 people,
might have been confused by false wiring into shutting down his only
good engine.
   The Times of London reported Friday, however, that investigators
were certain there was no wiring problem, and neither U.S. nor
British airline officials reported finding such a problem on any
other aircraft. Tests of U.S. 737s have to be completed by Sunday
morning.
   The latest ``airworthiness directive'' by the Federal Aviation
Administration gives airlines 72 hours to check whether cross-wiring
in cargo holds might cause sprinklers to go on in the wrong cargo
area in the event of a fire.
   The problem had been discovered in two of the aircraft, said FAA
spokesman Fred Farrar. He said no details were available on how the
problem was found or on which airliners, but he said neither
involved an actual fire or accident.
   The order involving 757s ``is not really relevant to the British
crash except that the subject is also miswiring,'' Farrar said.
   The FAA said 205 of the 757s are in service worldwide, with 119
of them used by four U.S. airlines: America West, Delta, Eastern and
Northwest.
   ``The miswiring means that if the flight crew got a warning
indicating a fire in the forward cargo compartment and pushed the
button to activate the fire extinguishing system for that
compartment, it would activate the system in the aft cargo
compartment,'' and vice-versa, said an FAA statement.
   The checks were not expected to disrupt any scheduled flights.

<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Del. Walter Fauntroy is
denying he has been contacted by the House Ethics Committee chairman
over putting the son of an Illinois representative on the
congressional payroll while the son was running for state office in
Chicago.
   The Associated Press, citing a congressional source, reported
Thursday that Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the ethics
committee, had written Fauntroy asking him to explain his hiring of
Thomas John Savage, the son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill.
   According to the source, who spoke only on condition of
anonymity, Dixon asked Fauntroy what duties Savage performed, and if
Savage had regularly reported to work.
   A federal investigation into the case began last month after The
AP reported Savage was on Fauntroy's payroll at the same time he was
running for the Illinois legislature.
   According to sworn affidavits submitted to Illinois Board of
Elections officials, Savage said he had fulfilled state requirements
by living continuously for two years in the legislative district he
sought to represent. That period covered the time he was on
FauntrAroll.
   House rules, meanwhile, require a congressional employee to
report regularly to work.
   Fauntroy, in a statement he issued to The Washington Post on
Friday, disputed the portion of the story that described Dixon's
letter.
   According to the Post, Fauntroy asserted that Dixon had not
written him about the Savage affair.
   But the congressional source, contacted again by the AP after
Fauntroy iso denial, on Friday reconfirmed and amplified his
original description of the letter.
   The source stated a letter from Dixon was received by Fauntroy's
office during the last week of December, and added that Johnny
Barnes, Fauntroy's staff director, had been preparing a response.
   However, it could not be learned whether Barnes completed his
letter, whether Fauntroy had seen it, or whether a response had been
sent to the Ethics panel.
   Fauntroy's staff refused repeated efforts by the AP _ which
included several telephone calls to Fauntroy's office and a visit
there by a reporter _ to obtain the statement,
   Repeated efforts to reach Dixon Friday were unsuccessful. Pat
Miller, the staff director of Dixon's Los Angeles office, said the
congressman was traveling out of state and would not return to
California until Wednesday. She said he had not left a telephone
number where he could be reached, and had not been calling in for
messages.
   Savage earned $21,398 while on Fauntroy's payroll from September
1987 through June 1988.
   The FBI is conducting a preliminary investigation into the case,
a Justice Department official confirmed Thursday.
   In the prepared statement, Fauntroy also said his staff had been
told by members of Dixon's personal office staff and Ethics
Committee officials that no such letter existed.
   Ethics committee officials were unavailable for comment Friday
afternoon. Neither Gwendolyn Brown, legislative director in Dixon's
Capitol Hill office, nor Andrea Holmes, his Washington press
secretary, could be reached for comment.

   A poor man and his wife went to the
Catholic Church's human rights agency for help and were handed 400
pesos, the equivalent of $1.30. They converted it to $500,000 by

   Officials at the Church's Vicary of Solidarity said Friday the
couple were given the handout last week when they went there for
help to return home in northern Chile after coming to Santiago to
visit a sick daughter.
   Two days later, they went back to the vicary to say thanks. The
man used 75 cents of the sum to bet on the weekly national soccer

   Hundreds of Nicaraguans and other Central Americans
seeking a promised land are pouring into this haven for immigrants,
but some who settled in the area after the 1979 Sandinista
revolution are wary of the newcomers.
   ``Some of the Nicaraguans here have mixed feelings about those
who stayed with the Sandinistas,'' said Maritza Herrera, head of the
Nicaraguan-American Foundation.
   ``They are people from the farm areas, with a different
orientation,'' said the Rev. Leon Pallais, a Nicaraguan priest who
runs the Nicaraguan Assistance Center in Little Havana.
   The Central Americans began arriving from southern Texas by the
busload Thursday and Friday following a federal judge's ruling that
the government could not keep them there while their applications
for political asylum were being processed.
   Since the judge's decision Monday, some 400 people have come
here, bringing the two-month total to about 2,000, most of them
Nicaraguans. Officials expect about 100,000 more over the next 18
months.
   Pallais said the new group is different from the first wave of
Nicaraguans that settled in southern Florida.
   Roberto Arguello, head of the Nicaraguan Bankers Association,
disagreed, saying the time has come to forget the differences that
separate the first group from the second.
   ``The bottom line is we are all Nicaraguans,'' he said. ``Back in
Nicaragua, there was no in-between. Here we just have to forget it.
... The objective is to help all Nicaraguans.''
   The latest group is coming to town with no guarantee of food,
shelter or social services, and officials are warning there will be
very little support once they arrive.
   Isidoro Cuevas, the Cuban-born mayor of Sweetwater, a heavily
Nicaraguan city in western Dade County, said his city will have
trouble absorbing the aliens.
   ``We've been trying to gather clothes and food to pass it on to
them,'' he said. ``But there are many dwellings shared by more than
one family already. People are sleeping on the front porches,
sleeping on the couches.''
   In Miami, about 250 immigrants have been staying in a sports
stadium, but the Baltimore Orioles baseball team arrives Jan. 25 for
spring training, and the immigrants will have to be relocated, most
likely to private shelters and churches.
   Mayor Xavier Suarez sought an emergency meeting with President
Reagan, and other officials urged President-elect George Bush, who
is fishing in the Florida Keys this weekend, to come to see the
situation for himself.
   Bush told reporters he would examine immigration policy when he
takes office. He said the newcomers are ``causing an overburdening
of facilities like schools and hospitals, and this is a sorry
commentary on what's happening in Central America and Nicaragua.
   ``The United States has to be generous, but no one community can
suffer an overload without some support in some way,'' he said.
   A delegation of community leaders visited southern Texas on
Friday to warn those awaiting transportation to Miami.
   ``If people come down there (Miami), they need to know that
they're going to have to fend for themselves,'' Dade County
Assistant County Manager Tony Ojeda said in Harlingen, Texas.
   He estimated the Miami area has 75,000 to 125,000 Nicaraguans,
along with thousands of other recently arrived Central Americans.
   More than 30,000 Central Americans passed through south Texas in
1988 seeking political asylum, according to the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   The best way for Miami to deal with the influx would be to allow
more of the immigrants to get work permits, Arguello said.
   ``With work permits for every Nicaraguan, the private sector can
step in and help,'' he said. ``We don't want to create a welfare
society.''

   A Teamsters international vice president,
convicted of embezzling union funds in an alleged ``ghost employee''
scheme, returns to court Tuesday to learn whether he must relinquish
his many union positions.
   Indicted in May 1986 with the late Teamsters President Jackie
Presser, Harold Friedman, 66, was convicted in U.S. District Court
on Friday of embezzlement, labor racketeering, conspiracy to commit
racketeering and filing false statements with the Labor Department.
   He could be sentenced to up to 46 years in prison and fined up to
$70,000.
   Anthony Hughes, 52, recording secretary of Local 507 in
Cleveland, Presser's home local, was convicted of labor
racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering and embezzlement. He
faces a penalty of up to 45 years imprisonment and a fine of up to
$60,000.
   Presser, who became president of the 1.6-million member union in
1983, died of brain cancer July 9 and was never tried.
   Friedman and Hughes declined comment after the verdict.
   Ohio's most powerful Teamster, Friedman is president of the Ohio
Council of Teamsters, leader of Teamsters Joint Council 41 in
northeast Ohio and president of Teamsters Local 507 and Bakery
Workers Local 19. The two locals share offices and have a combined
membership of about 12,000 people.
   Judge George W. White dismissed the jury until Tuesday. At that
time, attorneys say, the jurors will be asked to consider whether
the two men have to forfeit their union posts. No sentencing was
scheduled.
   Union officials convicted of any of several felonies, including
embezzlement, are required to relinquish their union positions for
13 years, according to Dick Crino, area administrator for the U.S.
Labor Department in Cleveland. But Paul J. Cambria, attorney for
Friedman, said other things are considered and that the jury will
deliberate those points Tuesday.
   Presser, Friedman and Hughes had been accused of being involved
in embezzling $700,000 from the union between 1972 and 1981 to pay
so-called ``ghost employees'' who didn't work for the money.
   Cambria said the verdict is puzzling because under the
racketeering counts, Friedman was convicted only of keeping two of
four alleged ``ghost employees'' on the payroll for three pay
periods.
   The racketeering counts that Friedman was convicted of accused
Friedman and Presser of embezzling up to $43,500 to pay Hughes and
up to $8,800 to pay George Argie. Hughes was accused of being a
``ghost employee,'' and Argie was an unindicted co-conspirator who
testified he did little, if any, work.
   ``I can't really make sense of the verdict at this point,''
Cambria said. ``We're going to have to determine if it (the verdict)
can be set aside because it was internally inconsistent.''
   Presser and Hughes were FBI informants, court documents
indicated. Presser's former attorney, John R. Climaco, has said that
Presser's defense would have been that he was authorized by the FBI
to hire the ``ghost employees'' to enhance and protect his image as
an FBI informant.
   During the trial, White rejected Cambria's motion asking that
documents regarding Presser's FBI informant activities be released.
   ``We were deprived from putting in the entire FBI aspect of this
because Jackie took that with him and the agents who are still alive
declined to testify,'' Cambria said.
   One of Hughes' attorneys, Rocco Russo, said he thought there were
``several inconsistencies'' in the verdict and declined to elaborate.

   A fishing boat and a coastal ferry
collided early today off the Korean peninsula, and 13 fishermen were
missing and presumed dead, maritime police said.
   The accident occurred in dense fog when the 2,904-ton Queen
ferryboat and the 95-ton Changyoung No. 7 collided off the southern
city of Yosu, the police said.
   The fishing vessel capsized. Patrol boats that rushed to the area
found no traces of survivors, police said.
   The ferry, carrying 120 passengers and 30 crewmen, sustained no
damage and arrived later in its destination of Cheju, the nation's
southernmost island, police said.
   Authorities blamed the fog for the accident.

<TEXT>
   A West German company that U.S
officials contend exported goods to Libya to help it build a
suspected chemical weapons plant is being investigated by a Black
Forest prosecutor.
   The new probe compounds official embarrassment over a scandal
that has dominated West German politics for two weeks.
   The Social Democratic Party's vice chairman, Gerhard Baum, called
Friday for a federal criminal probe.
   Government officials conceded Friday they had received
intelligence reports in October that indicated German companies may
have helped build the plant in Rabta, about 40 miles outside the
Libyan capital of Tripoli.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's spokesman, Friedhelm Ost, had said
earlier Bonn knew nothing of alleged West German complicity in the
project until U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz brought it up
during Kohl's visit to Washington in November.
   The United States contends the plant is on the verge of
full-scale production of poison gas. Libya claims it is a
pharmaceutical plant.
   At the same news conference at which Ost spoke, Finance Ministry
spokesman Karl-Heinz von den Driesch said investigators had found no
evidence against West German companies that would stand up in court.
   Werner Botz, chief prosecutor for the Offenburg region in the
Black Forest area, told The Associated Press that he opened the new
investigation into Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr after reading a detailed
report in this week's Stern magazine.
   The Hamburg-based magazine cited what it said were official
documents and witnesses in its article, which accused
Imhausen-Chemie, the now defunct I.B.I. Engineering of Frankfurt and
Pen Tsao medical supply of Hamburg of being deeply involved in the
Libya project.
   Stern alleged that Imhausen-Chemie provided ``everything that is
needed to build a chemical plant'' to I.B.I., which the magazine
said in turn shipped the materials to Libya under forged bills.
   The article also mentioned involvement by the Cross Link NV firm
of Antwerp, Belgium. The director of that company, Jozef Gedopt, was
arrested in Brussels on Wednesday and charged with forging shipping
documents on goods delivered to Libya.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Imhausen-Chemie on Friday
said the company would have no comment on the new developments.
   Attempts to reach the company's owner, Juergen
Hippenstiel-Imhausen, were unsuccessful.
   News reports have said Imhausen is on a foreign business trip.
   Kohl on Thursday said authorities had uncovered new documents
implicating West German companies and said investigators were giving
them a thorough look.
   West German law requires companies exporting hazardous materials,
arms or their components to obtain licenses from the Economics
Ministry. However, officials from that ministry have said the legal
situation regarding transfer of technology or consultation varies
from case to case.
   A West German delegation was in the United States the past week
to examine Washington's evidence on the plant's purpose and alleged
West German involvement.
   Nearly two weeks ago, U.S. officials said they suspected
Imhausen-Chemie. The Finance Ministry audited the company and
announced last week it had found no evidence of illegal exports.
   On Wednesday, government sources confirmed a criminal
investigation of I.B.I.'s activities and said customs authorities
had seized company documents.

   The letter couldn't have come at a better
time for Alaska.
   Just as legislators were preparing to cut the budget or impose
new taxes in the wake of declining oil revenues, Money magazine came
to the rescue.
   ``Let that alarm clock ring, State of Alaska. You're financially
independent and don't ever have to work again!'' the magazine
proclaimed in a letter addressed to the state.
   ``Dear S. Alaska: What a thought! To be so rich that you could do
whatever you want. Whenever you want. Virtually anywhere you
please,'' the letter continued.
   Alaska has won a chance at the magazine's $2 million
``Double-Your-Million Sweepstakes'' drawing, offered to attract new
subscriptions.
   Because computers know only what they're told, and because a
state office in Juneau is on a mailing list under ``State of
Alaska'' and the magazine used that list for its promotion, the
contest letter ended up in the state mailroom.
   ``If we win this and every other sweepstakes, Alaska will be over
its budget troubles,'' said David Ramseur, a spokesman for Gov.
Steve Cowper.
   The letter also includes a warning often heard in Alaska:
``Remember, millionaires who handle their money badly aren't
millionaires for long.''

   You've heard of ``L.A. Law?''
   Well, how does ``La. Law'' strike you?
   Pat Schultz, a spokesman for NBC television, said Thursday that
Terry Louise Fischer, the co-creator and former co-executive
producer of the hit prime time show about a Los Angeles law firm, is
writing a two-hour movie pilot for NBC about a woman district
attorney in New Orleans.
   Schultz said NBC is interested in the project as a potential
weekly series for the spring or fall. The network has the option to
order 13 episodes if it approves the script for the pilot, he said.
   Fischer, through her secretary, declined to provide details on
the as yet untitled project. Tesa Laviolette, director of the
Louisiana Office of Film and Video, said it is her understanding
that the program would explore New Orleans' close-knit business and
social structure. She described it as having a ``Dallas'' flavor
with a New Orleans twist.

   Triskaidekaphobiacs worried about Friday the
13th. Everybody should beware this weekend, a psychic says.
   Triskaidekaphobiacs are people who are afraid of the number 13.
   Friday the 13th has come and gone, but Mom Balaam, an Atlantic
City psychic and astrologer who is ``Like the Night With A Thousand
Eyes,'' according to her ads, said the entire weekend may be
dangerous.
   She said the alignment of the sun and moon would cause fights
between couples, especially if one of them was born on a ``bad'' day
_ most of which fall between the 15th and 19th of December, January,
February, April and June.
   ``Those people could be in a lot of trouble,'' she said. ``A
person born on a bad day is going to have a really bad day when the
planets and the stars are wrong. With this weekend looking the way
it is, right after Friday the 13th, I'd say stay indoors and watch
yourself.''
   Mrs. Rhonda Spiritualist, who bills herself as ``A True
Psychic,'' was optimistic. She said Friday the 13th had no more
likelihood of bestowing bad luck on people than July 7, 1977, or
7-7-77, had of bringing good luck. ``It's just another day,'' Mrs.
Spiritualist said. ``People shouldn't worry about things like that.
They should just go ahead and try to be happy with life.''

   A man was arrested after he made death
threats against President-elect George Bush, who is vacationing in
the Florida Keys, authorities said.
   George Hicks, 37, of Boca Raton was arrested in his apartment
Friday after he made telephone threats against Bush, Secret Service
agent Dave Nozneski said. No weapons were found in Hicks' apartment,
Nozneski said.
   Court documents quote Hicks as saying, ``If I see him, I'll kill
him.''
   Hicks, who described himself as an unemployed musician, was
charged with threatening the life of the president. A threat made
against the president or vice president is a federal felony
punishable by up to five years in prison.
   Hicks was in the custody of the U.S. Marshal's office Friday
night in West Palm Beach, Nozneski said.
   Hicks was ordered by the court to undergo psychiatric evaluations.
   Bush is fishing in the Florida Keys this weekend before returning
to Washington on Sunday to prepare for his inauguration Jan. 20.

   Communities planned celebrations and other events Monday to honor
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., including a
candlelight peace march in suburban Detroit and an anti-apartheid
demonstration in California.
   King's birthday will be observed as a federal holiday Monday in
all but six states, including Arizona, where it will be business as
usual at state offices.
   In New York City, a mural painted by high school students
depicting non-violence was unveiled Friday, and Mayor Edward Koch
mayor spoke of the ``grace and glory'' King brought to the United
States.
   In Michigan, the celebrations ``help us keep Dr. King's dream
alive and provide opportunities for all people to renew their
commitment to work for a society in which there is one standard of
equality and human rights,'' said state Sen. Jackie Vaughn.
   John Roy Castillo, director of the Michigan Civil Rights
Commission, said King's legacy has helped advance racial equality.
   ``Tremendous progress has been made over the last 20 to 25
years,'' he said Friday. ``There are more minorities who are elected
officials, there are more minority businesses, more professionals.''
   But he noted the high poverty and school dropout rate among
minorities.
   A symposium was planned Sunday and Monday at the University of
Michigan to honor King's work. Willie L. Brown, Jr., speaker of the
California Assembly, was to give the keynote address Sunday and
Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a close associate of King's, was
scheduled to speak Monday.
   The end of King day will be marked by a candlelight peace march
at Roeper City and Country School in Bloomfield Hills, a wealthy
northern suburb of Detroit.
   In Beverly Hills, Calif., 26 teen-agers moved into the South
African consulate Friday for a weekend anti-apartheid protest to
mark King's birthday.
   The students, none of them black and ranging in age from 13 to
19, occupied a hallway outside the consulate's third-floor office,
singing songs such as ``We Shall Overcome'' and other protest
anthems. The crowd blocked at least one person from entering.
   They said they would camp in the hallway until Monday, when
fellow protesters planned a march at the building to commemorate
King's birthday and to denounce South Africa's system of racial
segregation.
   The mural unveiled Friday at the Bronx Regional High School in
New York City was inspired after a student at the school was killed
in 1987. Ten students painted, kept journals and did research about
non-violence for the 10-month project.
   ``This is a world they'd like to change and make more peaceful,''
said Mark Weiss, the school principal.
   The mural depicts Indian peace leader Mohandas Gandhi, King, a
sign saying ``end segregation in public schools'' and two hands
shaking, one black, one white.
   In Arizona, federal and city offices will be closed Monday but
all state offices will remain open.
   King's birthday was a state holiday in Arizona for a brief time.
   Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, created the holiday by
executive order in 1986 after the Legislature refused to act. But,
as one of his first official acts as governor, Evan Mecham rescinded
the order before the first holiday could be celebrated. The action
touched off the first major controversy of his short-lived
administration.
   Mecham said he acted because Attorney General Bob Corbin, a
fellow Republican, had said that Babbitt's order was illegal because
a holiday requires legislative approval as well.
   Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford, who succeeded Mecham following his
impeachment and removal from office last year, is on record in favor
of a King holiday, although she has not followed Babbitt in creating
one by executive order.

   Bernhard Goetz, who was sentenced to one year in
jail for shooting four black men in a subway with an unlicensed gun,
says the violence resulted from ``the deterioration of society.''
   The 41-year-old electronics engineer was also ordered Friday to
pay a $5,000 fine by state Judge Stephen Crane, who said Goetz had
shown no remorse for his actions.
   ``I do feel this case is really more about the deterioration of
society than it is about me,'' said Goetz, whose 1984 shootings of
the men he said were trying to rob him prompted debates on racism,
self-defense and vigilantism.
   Assistant District Attorney Gregory Waples ``seemed, I'm sorry to
say, to believe that society needs to be protected from me,'' Goetz
said.
   ``Well, I don't believe that's the case,'' he said. ``I believe
society needs to be protected from criminals.''
   Goetz fled to New Hampshire after the shootings and later
surrendered. He told police he fired the .38-caliber revolver in
self-defense because he felt he was about to be robbed; the men
claimed they were panhandling.
   Three of the four, all 19 at the time, recovered from the
shooting. One, Darrell Cabey, was left brain-damaged and partially
paralyzed.
   Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder and other charges in his
June 1987 trial. An appeals court upheld the gun possession
conviction last year, but threw out the original six-month jail
sentence, saying it did not meet the requirements under state law,
which mandates a one-year sentence.
   Under the one-year jail sentence, Goetz gets credit for the nine
days he served immediately after his arrest, becoming eligible for
parole in 51 days.
   Goetz, who faced a new sentence of up to seven years, decided to
go ahead with the sentencing even though he has asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to review the case because he wants to get the jail
time over with, said his attorney, Mark Baker.
   His other attorney, Barry Slotnick, had asked the judge to limit
Goetz's sentence to the nine days he already served, pleading, ``Let
him go home where he belongs. ... He has lived in a fish bowl and he
should not go to jail.''
   The prosecutor said Goetz ``richly deserves to be punished'' and
called him ``a potential danger to himself and New York society.''
Waples sought a one-year sentence with supervised parole so Goetz
would be forced to undergo psychiatric treatment.
   Crane said Goetz's failure to show remorse for the crime ``gave
me concern he might recidivate in possessing a firearm'' and added
that a jail term ``would not be unduly harsh.''
   Goetz left immediately for the Rikers Island jail. The Correction
Department agreed to a defense request that Goetz be kept in
protective custody there, said Baker.
   Two jurors from Goetz's trial attended Friday's sentencing:
Catherine Brody, a college librarian, and Diana Serpe, an airline
reservations clerk.
   ``We felt we were so intensely involved and we had to follow it
through,'' said Brody. ``The problem is, it is the law, and as it is
the law, we feel it has to be followed or a signal is sent that the
law doesn't mean anything.''
   Ron Kuby, a lawyer representing Cabey in a multimillion-dollar
lawsuit against Goetz, called the sentence an outrage and said it
``gives license to bigots and lunatics all over the city of New York
to go out and blast people who they hate and fear.''
   ``I have spoken to Mrs. Cabey (Darrell's mother),'' Kuby said.
``She expected this but she is disappointed. She was hoping a stiff
sentence would prevent other people from going out and doing to
black youth what Bernhard Goetz did to Darrell Cabey. Unfortunately,
that's not going to happen.''

<HEAD>Chinese Artists Reunite 10 Years After Unprecedented Exhibit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ten years after their avant-garde exhibition in
a Beijing park shook up the Chinese art world, a group of pioneering
artists has reunited in this British colony for their first
retrospective.
   The youthful Chinese artists, known as ``The Stars,'' gained
prominence in 1979 when they marched through Beijing to protest
police interference in a show they had set up without official
approval.
   The authorities gave in and permitted the exhibition,
unprecedented in Communist China, which featured once-forbidden
topics such as nudes, abstracts and works of aesthetic rather than
political content.
   After a 1980 show, however, the 30-member group disbanded. While
some remained active in Beijing, others settled in Europe, Japan and
the United States.
   The retrospective, featuring the work of 12 group members, opened
Friday and is scheduled to run five weeks before moving to Taipei,
Taiwan, and Paris.
   Before ``The Stars,'' ``earlier art was all the same,'' said
sculptor Wang Keping, one of six members in Hong Kong for the
exhibition. ``The Stars'' showed artistic activity in China need not
be organized or approved by the ruling party, he said.
   Individuality was the driving force behind the group, said
gallery owner Chang Tsong-zung, who organized the retrospective.
   ``The only common aim of the artists when they first started was
that they wanted to be different from each other.''
   Bo Yun, a teacher at Beijing's Academy of Arts and Design whose
abstract scroll paintings are part of the retrospective, claims
artistic freedom in China has advanced since the group's 1979
exhibition though limitations remain.
   There is no problem, he said, ``if you use a work of art to
satirize an opponent of the government. But if you mock the
government, I'm afraid that will pose a problem.''
   ``The Stars'' also say Beijing no longer allows them to exhibit
as a group, thwarting attempts in 1983 and 1986. The reason,
believes Bo, is that the group's name has become a symbol of the
democracy movement.
   The retrospective includes works from the late 1970s, including
Wang's Buddha-like bust of Chairman Mao Tse-tung signifying the
deification of the Communist leader during the ultraleftist 1966-76
Cultural Revolution. It is called ``The Idol.''
   Other pieces adopt current themes, including the mixed-media work
``Safe Sex'' by Ai Weiwei that features a prophylactic attached to a
rain coat.
   The works, which cost up to several thousand dollars, are as
different as the paths the artists have taken since they disbanded.
   Wang, 39, a soft-spoken man with a small goatee, moved to Paris
in 1984, convinced he could not develop further in China largely
because of political pressure.
   ``Art freedom is only possible in a democratic country with human
rights,'' he said.
   Wang recently wrote a play titled, ``The Retrial of Wei
Jingsheng,'' who led a pro-democracy movement in China before being
sentenced to a 15-year prison term in 1979.
   Bo, 40, has remained in Beijing, supplementing his $40 monthly
salary by selling his paintings to foreigners and at overseas
exhibits.
   Other ``Stars'' on display in the retrospective include Huang Rui
and Ma Desheng, the two leaders of the group, and Li Shuang, who was
arrested in 1981 and sentenced to two years of labor re-education
for ``incitement to debauchery.'' When she was arrested, she was
living with a French diplomat but had yet to marry him.
   Although ``The Stars'' have scattered across the globe they have
stayed in touch with one another. From the heady days of 1979-80 was
forged ``a feeling of brotherhood'' that has not diminished, Bo said.

<HEAD>Defense Rests In Trial Of Man Accused In Daughter's Beating Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense rested in the murder trial of Joel
Steinberg, accused of beating to death his illegally adopted
6-year-old daughter, without introducing an insanity defense and
without calling him to testify.
   During 11 weeks of testimony, the jury heard 39 prosecution
witnesses and 13 defense witnesses.
   State Judge Harold Rothwax scheduled the defense summation for
next Thursday. He told the jurors the government would sum up next
Friday and they would get the case on Jan. 23 after receiving the
judge's instructions.
   With the jury absent, Rothwax again asked Steinberg's lawyers,
Ira D. London and Adrian DiLuzio, ``Am I correct you do not intend
to introduce an insanity defense?''
   ``You are 100 percent correct, your honor,'' DiLuzio replied.
   Rothwax had repeatedly pressed Steinberg's lawyers to tell him if
they intended to argue that Steinberg was not responsible for Lisa
Steinberg's death by reason of mental defect or disease.
   In case they did, the judge had ordered the defendant to be
examined by a prosecution psychiatrist to determine his mental
condition on Nov. 1, 1987, the night he is accused of fatally
beating Lisa.
   The examination was completed Thursday night.
   The judge said if the defense made any reference in their
summation next week to Steinberg being motivated by ``cults,
staring, or that he heard electronic mousetraps in the walls of his
apartment'' that would be tantamount to introducing an insanity
defense.
   If that happened, the judge said, he would reopen the trial and
let the prosecution psychiatrist testify.
   The decision by the defense not to use an insanity defense leaves
the jury with a circumstantial case in which no one said they saw
Lisa killed.
   Hedda Nussbaum, Steinberg's former live-in companion, testified
that Steinberg told her he struck Lisa because the child was
``staring at him and trying to place him in a hypnotic trance.''
   Both Steinberg and Ms. Nussbaum, 46, were charged with
second-degree murder for ``depraved indifference'' to Lisa's life.
Charges against Ms. Nussbaum were dismissed in October, at the
request of the prosecution, which says she was too battered and
emotionally crippled to harm Lisa, but the defense challenges that
contention.
   London told reporters outside the courtroom that the prosecution

   A man who tipped federal agents to the
whereabouts in 1981 of an escaped spy has been charged with murder
in the death of a U.S. Forest Service officer during a shootout near
this northern Idaho town.
   Joseph Pratt, 27, and his brother James, 29, surrendered to
authorities shortly after Thursday's gun battle in which Brent
Jacobson was killed.
   Authorities had tracked the men in rugged, snowy terrain for
nearly a day after a botched house robbery Wednesday night.
   Joseph Pratt received a reward for turning in Christopher Boyce,
who had escaped from a California prison in 1980 and had been living
in a remote area of northern Idaho near the Canadian border for 19
months. Boyce had been serving a 40-year sentence for his conviction
in 1977 of selling CIA satellite information to the Soviets.
   He was recaptured Aug. 21, 1981, in Port Angeles, Wash.
   Boyce has been chronicled in two books by Robert Lindsey, ``The
Falcon and the Snowman,'' which was made into a motion picture, and
its sequel, ``The Flight of the Falcon.''
   Joseph, James and a third brother, Brett Pratt, received immunity
from prosecution for their testimony against Boyce at his 1982 trial
on conspiracy and bank robbery charges.
   The Pratts testified they had taken part in a series of robberies
that Boyce masterminded in 1980 and 1981 in Washington, Idaho and
Montana. Boyce pleaded guilty to 10 counts of conspiracy, bank
robbery and firearms violations a week into the trial.
   Joseph Pratt was charged Friday in Bonner County Magistrate Court
with first-degree murder, two counts of attempted first-degree
murder, first-degree burglary, robbery, two counts of second-degree
kidnapping, and two counts of aggravated assault. He was being held
without bond in the Bonner County Jail.
   James Pratt was under guard at Bonner General Hospital following
surgery for a gunshot wound to his leg. Arraignment was scheduled
Monday on the same charges as his brother, said Prosecutor Phil
Robinson.
   Police said Wednesday's botched home robbery netted $12.
   As officers arrived, the men sped away, firing several times at a
pursuing vehicle. The gunmen abandoned their car after it ran into a
snowbank, then fled on foot into the woods.
   Officers from several agencies tracked the men Wednesday night,
resuming the search at daybreak Thursday in knee-deep snow drifts,
police said.
   Bonner County Sheriff Chip Roos said Jacobson was killed just as
tracking teams were being recalled because of darkness.
   The gunmen apparently fled to a home about a mile away. There,
about 1{ hours later, a call was placed to the sheriff's office, and
one of the men said they were ready to surrender, Roos said.

   Tremors measuring up to 4.8 on the Richter
scale have shaken Iran's southern Fars province but caused no
casualties or damage, the Islamic Republic News Agency said today.
   The agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted the Shiraz Seismological
Center as saying a quake measuring 4.8 struck the cities of Larestan
and Bastak late Friday.
   IRNA said several other moderate tremors were reported Friday
night and this morning but gave no further details.
   In 1988, at least 30 tremors measuring from 3.0 to 4.8 rocked the
quake-prone Fars region without causing any injuries or damage, IRNA
said.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake of around 5 can cause considerable damage.

   Forty-eight policemen will have to
settle for a job well done instead of the expensive watches they
received from the president of the United Arab Emirates in gratitude
for guarding him.
   ``It was not deemed correct that officials receive extra
compensation for fulfillment of their normal duties,'' said an
Aachen police spokesman.
   The president, Sheik Zayed Bin Sultan Nahyan, gave the Swiss
watches to the policemen who guarded him during an August 1987
visit, said the spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   ``The watches are worth several thousand marks (more than $1,000)
each, and officials are questioning the propriety of accepting the
gifts,'' he said.
   The new police chief, Heinrich Boenninghausen, has decided the
watches should be auctioned off with the money to go to charity, the
spokesman said.
   Two of the policemen have filed a court complaint asking that
they be allowed to keep their watches, he said.
   The administrative court has issued a restraining order on the
auctioning off the watches to study the case, the spokesman said.

<TEXT>
   Doctors at the nation's leading transplant
center have stopped doing multiple-organ abdominal transplants until
they can find a better way of keeping the body from rejecting the
organs.
   ``We're in no sense foreclosing the thing,'' said Dr. Thomas E.
Starzl, who pioneered the surgery. ``We have an operation that's
fundamentally sound. But we don't quite yet have the capability of
bringing it off in a predictable and reliable way.''
   Starzl's recommendation Friday to Children's Hospital of
Pittsburgh not to perform any more of the experimental operations
until anti-rejection drug therapy is improved came a week after the
death of 3-year-old Rolandrea ``Rolly'' Dodge of Fruitland, N.M.
   The toddler died Jan. 6 in Children's Hospital, six weeks after
receiving a liver, pancreas, stomach, small intestine and part of a
large intestine.
   Preliminary laboratory tests revealed similarities between the
New Mexico child's death and that of Tabatha Foster, the only other
person to receive five transplanted organs in a single operation.
The Madisonville, Ky., girl survived six months before dying last
May of a blood infection.
   ``We probably need better tools,'' Starzl said. ``We're looking
ahead to getting better methods of controlling (organ) rejection.''
   Starzl said doctors deliberately waited a year before proceeding
with a second transplant involving multiple abdominal organs. They
decided on Rolly, who was born with a disorder that prevented her
intestines from absorbing food and liquids.
   Based on their experience with Tabatha, surgeons gave Rolly less
cyclosporine, a potent anti-rejection medication. But her name was
placed back on the transplant waiting list Jan. 4 when tests showed
her small intestine was being rejected by her body's immune system.
A suitable donor was never found and she died of multiple-organ
failure.
   Tissue analyses on Rolly are incomplete, but doctors believe she
and Tabatha suffered from a dangerous proliferation of white blood
cells.
   The same problem also plagued Michael Steward, 10 months, of
Rockford, Ill., who died last May following a four-organ transplant
at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in Chicago.
   ``This really troubles us a lot that this has popped up now in
three of three cases,'' Starzl said.
   Starzl's concerns were not unanimous.
   Dr. James W. Williams, director of transplantation at the Chicago
hospital, said last week that he intended to procede with his
multiple organ transplant program. Williams has performed two.
   Similarly, surgeons at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and
Clinics in Madison have shown no inclination of stopping their
intestinal transplant program.
   The first person to undergo a multiple-abdominal organ
transplant, a 6-year-old girl, lived only a few hours after Starzl's
1983 operation. The second patient, a 17-month-old boy, survived
three days in 1986 at the Chicago hospital.
   The string of failures is reminiscent of the early days of liver
transplantation, said Starzl, who performed the world's first
successful liver transplant in 1967.
   The one-year survival rate for liver transplant patients has
since climbed to about 70 percent, according to Brian Broznick,
director of the Pittsburgh Transplant Foundation.
   The only surviving multiple organ recipient, 14-month-old Calvin
Oliveira of Deerfield Beach, Fla., received a small intestine and
liver Dec. 31 at the Wisconsin hospital. He was in critical but
stable condition Friday at the Madison hospital.
   Organ transplants are the only option for children like Calvin
with short gut syndrome, a potentially fatal intestinal deformity,
according to Starzl. Tabatha also had short gut syndrome.

   Japan may postpone a visit by 60 Chinese ``war
orphans'' from World War II who are scheduled to arrive the same day
as Emperor Hirohito's funeral, officials said today.
   The Health and Welfare Ministry is concerned that their arrival
on Feb. 24 would focus attention on World War II tragedies while
more than 100 foreign dignitaries take part in a state funeral for
Hirohito, news reports quoted ministry officials as saying.
   Hirohito died of cancer one week ago at age 87.
   The war orphans, the offspring of Japanese nationals who resided
in northern China and Manchuria during Japan's invasion of East
Asia, were left behind as infants in the turmoil following Japan's
defeat in 1945.
   Since 1981, about 18 groups of orphans from China have come to
Japan to search for their Japanese relatives.
   Officials at the National Olympics Memorial Youth Center, where
the orphans would stay, said the government ministry had asked them
if the facility would be available at a later date if the visit,
originally scheduled for Feb. 24-March 10, is postponed.
   Under a 1988 agreement between China and Japan, about 100 orphans
are scheduled to visit this year.

   A 93-year-old World War I veteran who
caught a shell in the leg and was gassed by German soldiers but
continued to fight has been awarded a Purple Heart some 70 years
later.
   Milroy Tollin received the award Thursday.
   ``For a guy to receive a Purple Heart after 70 years is

   Tollin had for years insisted that he had been gassed during the
war, but no mention of that was made on his records, said Goodhue
County Veterans Service Officer Bernie Melter. Without that, the
Army could not award the Purple Heart, Melter said.
   Last summer, however, Melter found Army documents showing poison
attacks had been made on U.S. troops on the dates and in the areas
Tollin had claimed.

<HEAD>OPEC Chief Stresses Need For Cartel Solidarity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said
solidarity among the cartel's 13 member nations was the main reason
for a recent rise in oil prices, a Saudi Arabian newspaper reported
today.
   The newspaper Al-Nadwa quoted Subroto as saying in an interview
that cooperation from non-OPEC oil producers along with dwindling
stockpiles as demand rises, partly because of winter, also
contributed to the increase.
   ``Solidarity of OPEC member states after the last OPEC conference
is the most important reason (for the hike), but this strength
hinges primarily on the extent of adherence to the terms of the last
agreement,'' Subroto was quoted as saying.
   Middle East oil prices have risen more than $3 a barrel from a
range of $11-$15 a barrel since the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries introduced a Jan. 1 production quota of 18.5
million barrels a day.
   Because of a glut on the world market, oil prices plunged as low
as $10 a barrel in price swings over the past two years that rarely
reached OPEC's target of an $18 benchmark price.
   Subroto told Al-Nadwa the price fluctuations were caused for
reasons ``within and outside'' OPEC, in a reference to
over-production by some cartel members in defiance of the quota
system.
   ``It is when OPEC is hit by weakness and confusion that the
stockpiles are used (to aggravate the glut) and this affects the
price, but that rises the minute solidarity returns,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   Subroto admitted it was hard for OPEC to determine the quantities
stockpiled in order to balance the market with its output, but said
all member nations were hopeful the $18 a barrel benchmark would
prevail.
   Subroto left the Sultanate of Oman today after holding talks with
Oil Minister Saeed Al-Shanfari in advance of a Jan. 26 meeting in
London, where OPEC and non-OPEC producers will try to coordinate
policy on stabilizing prices.
   Subroto earlier had visited Egypt, which along with Oman is a
non-OPEC producer that cooperates with the cartel.

   Cynthia Duncan knew two weeks ago that her
return flight from Washington was scheduled for Friday the 13th _
and seeing fire trucks along the runway didn't make her feel any
better.
   But superstition lost out to savvy Friday afternoon, when a
Northwest Airlines jet landed safely at Detroit Metropolitan Airport
after losing one of its wheels on takeoff from Washington National
Airport.
   Flight 345 landed without incident, 15 minutes behind schedule,
and taxied on its own to the passenger gate, said Northwest
spokesman Bob Gibbons.
   He said the wheel was one of four on the right main landing gear.
The cause of the mishap is under investigation.
   ``Everybody pretty much knew there was something wrong,'' said
Duncan, 32, of Detroit. ``Surprisingly, the landing was very smooth.
Everyone was very calm. I was just very, very happy to hit ground,
have the plane stop and get off the plane.''
   The Boeing 757 was carrying 143 passengers and six crew members.
There were no injuries, although the fallen wheel severely damaged a
private plane parked at National Airport.
   In Detroit, the plane made a low pass so it could be observed
from the tower, said Mike Conway, a Metropolitan Airport spokesman.
Fire trucks and other emergency equipment lined a runway and the
plane was given clearance to land, he said.
   After the plane landed and the pilot described the incident,
``everybody sort of looked at everybody.'' said passenger James
Osmer. ``There was some applause then. It's better that they don't
tell you these things until you're on the ground.''

<TEXT>
   The powerful Oil Workers Union has been left
with a leadership vacuum after the jailing of its longtime leaders
on homicide and weapons charges. Leading analysts called the arrests
a political move.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
indicated more arrests are expected.
   The arrests this week of union boss Joaquin Hernandez Galicia and
50 others, including its secretary-general, carried a message from
new President Carlos Salinas de Gotari for other unions, the
newspaper Excelsior said in a front-page column Friday. Salinas was
inaugurated last month.
   ``The dramatic arrest of (Hernandez Galicia) and his closest
associates should be seen not as a normal legal action, as the
attorney general is uselessly depicting it, but as a presidential
decision, 100 percent political, which is covered by a thin veil of
legality,'' wrote columnist Lorenzo Meyer, of the prestigious
Colegio de Mexico, a graduate school and think tank.
   ``With the fall of (Hernandez Galicia), all the labor and union
leaders who emerged and prospered in the shadow of the state are
placed at the disposition of the government and in quite a
vulnerable position.''
   Gaston Garcia Cantu, a government supporter, wrote in a column in
Excelsior, ``It's not a legal but a political problem; not between
the judicial power and the delinquents but between the old and new
society in our country.'' Most of Mexico's unions have been closely
tied to the government.
   Hernandez Galicia and Salinas have been at odds since Salinas, as
budget secretary, began cutting into the 200,000-member union's
control of contracts with Pemex, the state oil monopoly.
   The union long has been known to have weapons, Meyer said.
   The Attorney General's Office said 200 Uzi submachine guns were
found when soldiers and federal agents burst into Hernandez
Galicia's home Tuesday in the northeastern city of Ciudad Madero and
arrested him.
   A federal agent was killed in the shootout.
   The Excelsior news service reported Friday that the Attorney
General's Office has asked Interpol, the international police
agency, to help find and arrest the former mayor of Reynosa, across
the Rio Grande from McAllen, Texas.
   Hernandez Galicia told investigators the former mayor, Jose Cruz
Contreras, arranged the arms shipment, and that the weapons were
smuggled from the United States, the Attorney General's Office said.

   A Canadian Jewish group has asked the Soviet Union
to set up an international commission to trace a Swedish diplomat
who disappeared in Soviet custody after saving thousands of Jews
from the Holocaust.
   Many believe Raoul Wallenberg, credited with saving 103,000 Jews
in World War II, is still alive in a Soviet prison. If so, he would
be 77.
   ``We're not confident we know everything that could be known,''
David Matas, vice president of B'nai B'rith Canada, told reporters
Friday. ``This would be a true test of the new Soviet policy of
glasnost.''
   When Soviet troops liberated Hungary in January 1945, Wallenberg
was arrested for espionage and sent to Moscow. The Soviets say he
died of a heart attack in a Moscow jail in 1947, but various Soviet
dissident sources have reported seeing him this decade.
   Matas discussed the issue Friday with Alexei Makarov,
minister-counselor of the Soviet Embassy. Matas said Makarov called
Wallenberg a hero and said he regrets what happened to him.
   B'nai B'rith asked the Soviets to appoint a commission of
historians from Canada, Hungary, Israel, Sweden, the Soviet Union
and the United States. The commission members would interview
surviving witnesses, review Soviet archives and make a public report.
   In 1944, Wallenberg volunteered for a mission to save Jews in
Budapest from Nazi death camps, and is credited with saving the Jews
from Nazi death camps by giving some Swedish passports, putting
others in safe houses and pleading with Nazi officials to spare
their lives.
   An estimated 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during their
1933-45 rule.
   If Wallenburg is alive, he would have been in captivity 43 years.

   Gay and lesbian groups say they will seek
other ways to oust a judge who said he gave a lighter sentence to a
killer partly because the victims were ``queers'' if a state
comission doesn't take action.
   The State Commission on Judicial Conduct began its inquiry into
state District Court Judge Jack Hampton of Dallas on Friday. The
11-member commission of judges and private citizens meets behind
closed doors and does not discuss pending cases.
   ``We, at this point are going to let the commission do its job,''
said Glen Maxey, executive director of the Lesbian Gay Rights Lobby
of Texas. But he said the commission's secret deliberations were a
``hideous situation.''
   About two dozen protesters gathered outside the building where
the commission met and called for Hampton's removal from the bench,
but said should that fail, they could always find other ways.
   Hampton, a Republican, is up for re-election in 1990.
   Last month, Hampton said he sentenced 18-year-old Richard
Bednarski to 30 years in prison instead of a maximum life sentence
because the two men he killed were homosexuals.
   ``These two guys that got killed wouldn't have been killed if
they hadn't been cruising the streets picking up teen-age boys,''
Hampton told the Dallas Times Herald.
   Bednarski was convicted of the murders of Tommy Lee Trimble, 34,
and John Lloyd Griffin, 27, who were found shot to death in a Dallas
park.
   ``I don't care much for queers cruising the streets picking up
teen-age boys. I've got a teen-age boy,'' Hampton told the newspaper.
   His remarks sparked continuing protests from homosexual and civil
liberties groups.
   ``It's absolutely intolerable to have a bigot use that kind of
language when he's supposed to be in the business of dispensing
equal justice,'' said Tom Doyal, who heads one of several groups
that have filed complaints against Hampton with the commission.
   ``How can you preside and be fair to everyone if you do not have
the same respect for all individuals?'' said Pellegrino, one of the
protesters.
   The commission could dismiss the case, or it could impose
sanctions ranging from a private warning to appointment of a special
master by the Texas Supreme Court to conduct a removal hearing.
   Commission Chairman William Junell, a judge on the Houston
appeals court, said, ``We're here to do the job that the law calls
on us to do.''
   Hampton, who was not called to appear at the meeting, did not
return telephone calls to The Associated Press.
   The Texas Civil Liberties Union, the Texas Human Rights
Commission, the National Lawyers Guild and the Lesbian Gay Rights
Lobby of Texas have filed complaints with the commission on the case.

   A Bismarck man accidentally locked inside a
store while applying for a credit card said he hopes his application
will be approved after all the trouble he went through.
   Chris Williams, 19, and Dan Neer, 18, said they were in a Sears,
Roebuck and Co. store Thursday night where Williams filled out a
credit-card application.
   Williams said it took him a half hour to complete the paperwork,

<TEXT>
   A probate judge has ordered a psychiatric
evaluation of author, singer and songwriter Barry Sadler, who
suffered brain damage following a shooting in Guatemala last year.
   Sadler, 48, whose ``Ballad of the Green Berets'' was a No. 1 hit
in 1966, is at the center of a battle between his mother and his
son, who both want to become his legal guardian.
   Cuyahoga County Probate Judge John Donnelly on Friday filed a
temporary restraining order preventing Sadler from being moved
against his will from Cleveland. Donnelly said psychiatrist Kurt
Bertschinger will evaluate Sadler by Jan. 20 to determine whether he
is competent to make his own decisions.
   ``He will remain at Southwest General Hospital until he wants to
leave,'' Donnelly said.
   The judge said he will decide after the evaluation whether the
court has jurisdiction to appoint Sadler's mother as guardian.
   ``If he is competent, maybe we don't need a guardian,'' said
Donnelly, adding that Sadler's 24-year-old son, Thor, would be
allowed to visit his father.
   Davidson County Probate Judge James Everett of Nashville, Tenn.,
on Tuesday appointed the younger Sadler as temporary guardian, but
Donnelly said Everett agreed Friday to the psychiatric evaluation.
   Sadler, who was shot in the head in Guatemala City in September,
checked out of Cleveland's Veterans Administration hospital Sunday
against medical advice.
   He left after learning that hospital officials planned to send
him back to a Nashville VA hospital, said his attorney, Joseph
Meissner.
   Thor Sadler said 30 percent of his father's brain was damaged by
the bullet.
   Meissner said Friday that Sadler is mentally competent and wants
his mother, Blanche Bebe Sadler, appointed guardian to help him
conduct his affairs.
   A hearing is set in Nashville on Wednesday on a petition filed
Jan. 10 by Sadler's wife, Lavona Ruth, and children, Thor, Baron and
Brooke, asking the court to appoint one of them guardian and return
Sadler to Nashville.
   Guatemala City police reports indicate Sadler was shot by
accident when a gun fell out of his pocket and went off while he was
riding in a taxi, his son said.
   Sadler also is the author of more than 20 books, featuring Casca,
a mercenary condemned to everlasting life until the Second Coming of
Jesus Christ.

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court overstepped its jurisdiction in
finding the American television series Falcon Crest too degenerate
for Egyptian viewers, said a government lawyer who was appealing the
case today.
   ``If ... the plaintiff didn't like the series, all he needed to
do was to switch off his television set,'' said Ragaee Ahmed Issa,
the technical department chief of the State Litigation Authority.
   Usually shown weekly, the series about a California wine-making
estate is highly popular in this Moslem country. The series stars
Jane Wyman and Lorenzo Lamas.
   A court in the Nile Delta town of Shibin el-Kom banned the series
last month after lawyer Mustafa Hamed Khalifa argued that scenes in
Falcon Crest are ``against morality and the constitution and incite
debauchery.''
   The court ordered the Information Ministry, which controls the
Television and Radio Authority, to stop screening the series.
   Television ignored the ruling. On Sunday, it rebroadcast the last
two episodes of the series' seventh season, and a day later showed
the first episode of the new season.
   Issa said the Litigation Authority, which represents the
government in civil court cases, appealed to a higher court at
Shibin el-Kom.
   ``We expect to win,'' Issa said. ``We expect the (appeal) court
to rule that the ban order was outside the jurisdiction of the
court.''
   Disputes with the government must be litigated only in the
Cairo-based Administrative Court, Issa said.
   Issa also objected to the ruling because the judge accepted the
plaintiff's allegations without making an independent court
assessment.
   Falcon Crest began appearing several years ago and quickly gained
popularity. Television censors routinely cut kissing scenes they
consider too passionate.

<HEAD>Attorney Moves To Consolidate Lawsuits In Cincinnati Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney has moved to consolidate all the
lawsuits filed in the crash over Scotland of Pan Am Flight 103 for
trial in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati.
   Stanley M. Chesley's motion was filed Friday with the Judicial
Panel on Multidistrict Litigation in Washington, which decides where
to send cases after related lawsuits have been filed in two or more
federal jurisdictions.
   ``This court is set up to do it,'' Chesley said. ``This court and
its staff are accustomed to handling complex cases.''
   Pan Am's jet was en route to New York on Dec. 21 when a bomb
exploded and the plane crashed, killing all 259 aboard and 11 people
on the ground. A number of the victims were Americans.
   Chesley urged the panel to ask Chief Judge Carl B. Rubin if he or
another judge in Cincinnati would take on the trial.
   ``It would be a challenge to prove that a court system designed
in the 19th century to try one case at a time could adapt and handle
something like this,'' Rubin said.
   Two high-profile multidistrict cases have been sent to Rubin in
recent years.
   One consolidated hundreds of lawsuits filed on behalf of
youngsters whose birth defects were blamed on the morning sickness
pill Bendectin, made in Reading, Ohio, by Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc.
   This year, Rubin's court heard thousands of farmers' lawsuits
concering rain insurance policies they were denied last year by the
Chubb Group of Insurance Companies.

<UNK>U.S. Congressmen Propose Plan To Protect Amazon Jungle</UNK>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A team of visiting U.S. legislators has
proposed that Brazil convert portions of its foreign debt payments
to protect the Amazon jungle from deforestation, a foreign ministry
spokesman said.
   The spokesman, Ruy Nogueira, said the American commission made
its proposals Friday to Brazilian President Jose Sarney during a
private session at his official residence in Brasilia.
   The team, composed of Sens. Timothy Wirth, Richard Shelby, John
Heinz and Reps. Gerry Sikorsky and John Bryant, is in Brazil on a
fact-finding mission that will include visits to the western states
of Amazonas, Rondonia and Acre.
   The proposals show an increased willingness on the part of
creditor nations to link new credit proposals with environmental
protection packages.
   Nogueira said the American delegation made no official
declarations, but sketched several proposals in which Brazil would
use portions of its foreign debt payments to create environmental
preservation projects in the western Amazon.
   Brazil is the Third World's leading debtor nation, with a foreign
debt of $115 billion.
   But in a meeting Friday at the foreign ministry, one government
representative told reporters it was ``unreasonable to insist that
Brazil pull back its development programs in the name of protecting
the environment.
   ``A developing country that has to create 1.7 million new jobs
per year and service debt cannot forgo the occupation of its
territory,'' said the sub-secretary of foreign relations, Paulo
Tarso Flecha de Lima.
   He said Brazil is studying how best to commercially develop the
Amazon without causing widespread ecological damage.
   But without debt relief from industrialized countries, occupying
the Amazon in a ``rational manner'' would be difficult.
   ``The international community must assist us with debt relief,
technical assistance and financial support,'' said Flecha de Lima.
   The issue of how to develop the Amazon jungle, an expanse of
tropical forest about two-thirds the size of continental United
States, has taken on international significance.
   Satellite inspection shows cattle ranchers and miners each year
chop or burn down an area the size of Belgium from the jungle, which
extends across 60 percent of Brazil's territory and contains 30
percent of the world's rainforest.
   Conservationists are worried about the ``greenhouse effect'' on
global climate from uncontrolled burning in the Amazon basin.
   The removal of oxygen-producing trees and release of noxious
gases into the atmosphere, some experts say, raises the earth's
temperature and could have been a factor in the summer 1988 drought
in the Midwest.

   North Korea charged that South Korean troops today
fired automatic weapons at one of its guardposts in the
demilitarized zone separating the two countries.
   The North's official Korean Central News Agency called the
incident ``a grave armed provocation'' and said military officials
had lodged a protest with the South.
   The news agency, monitored in Tokyo, said the weapons were
deliberately fired by South Korean troops, ``gravely menacing the
safety of civil policemen of our side.''
   The protest ``denounced this armed provocation as a wanton
violation of the armistice agreement and a premeditated provocation
rendering the situation strained'' in the demilitarized zone, it
said.
   The news agency did not provide any other details of the alleged
incident.
   The two Koreas have remained enemies since the 1950-53 Korean
War, which ended with an armistice but no formal peace treaty.
   Shooting incidents are reported several times each year along the
highly militarized ``demilitarized zone'' that separates the two
countries.

<TEXT>
   A high-ranking Vietnamese official arrived in
Beijing tonight for talks apparently aimed at settling the conflict
in Cambodia.
   The arrival of the man believed to be Vice Foreign Minister Dinh
Nho Liem marked the first time in more than nine years that
high-ranking Chinese and Vietnamese officials will meet to discuss
peace in Southeast Asia.
   Beijing arms guerrillas opposing Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia.
   The official was greeted by Vietnamese and Chinese officials at
the old Beijing Airport, an airstrip reserved for senior government
officials from China and abroad.
   The man then ducked into a Chinese Foreign Ministry car which
sped away. Vietnamese Ambassador Nguyen Minh Phuong followed in
another car.
   Vietnamese Embassy officials and Chinese officials at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs refused to comment on the arrival.
   But Liem's name was on the flight log of Air China Flight No. 974
which flew out of Bangkok today. And Japanese journalists reported
seeing him at the Bangkok airport.
   A top Cambodian resistance official said this week that China, at
the request of the Soviet Union, agreed to its first high-level
talks with Vietnam since late 1979.
   The deal also involved the Soviet Union opening direct talks with
Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, according to
Sihanouk's son and representative in Thailand, Prince Norodom
Ranariddh.
   Ranariddh made the disclosures in a broadcast over the resistance
radio Wednesday. He said either the Vietnamese minister of foreign
affairs or a vice minister would travel to China in early February.
It was not clear why Vietnam and China had decided to hold the
meeting earlier than scheduled.
   Thai officials said they knew about the meeting but would give no
details.
   On Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Li Zhaoxing,
said China would consider direct talks with Vietnam ``at an
appropriate time.'' He refused to elaborate.
   The direct talks between China and Vietnam follow the initiation
of talks in August between China and the Soviet Union on the
Cambodian question, a major stumbling block for improving
long-strained ties between the Moscow and Beijing governments.
   In the 1960s and mid-70s, China provided major assistance for
North Vietnam's war against the United States and South Vietnam.
   China's relations with Vietnam have been cold since late 1978
when Vietnam toppled the pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.
   The ultra-radical Khmer Rouge had ruled Cambodia since 1975 in a
bloody reign that left at least 1 million people dead.
   Beijing and Vietnam fought a border war in early 1979. Vice
ministerial talks were held in May 1979 in Hanoi and December in
Beijing and then cut off.
   Beijing now arms guerrillas opposing Vietnam's occupation of
Cambodia. One of the guerrilla groups is the Khmer Rouge.
   China has long said that the first step to a solution to the
conflict in Cambodia is for Vietnam to withdraw its troops, and had
refused to open direct talks with Hanoi until Vietnam moves to end
its decade-long occupation of Cambodia. In recent months, signs have
pointed to improved relations.
   On Jan. 7, China said a Vietnamese proposal to withdraw all of
its troops from Cambodia by September was a ``step forward.''
Earlier, Vietnam, facing serious economic problems at home, set a
target of 1990 for leaving Cambodia.
   In a speech Jan. 6, Heng Samrin, the Vietnamese-installed
president of Cambodia, said Vietnam would be out of Cambodia by
September if a political settlement to the conflict can be reached.
   In his proposal, Heng said his government still wanted measures
to prevent the Khmer Rouge from returning to power.
   China has refused to exclude the Khmer Rouge from a future
Cambodian government but has said it is willing to reduce its
assistance to the Khmer Rouge and other guerrillas forces as Vietnam
pulls out.
   Vietnam claims it has made partial troop withdrawals each year
since 1982. But China says Vietnam actually has only rotated forces
in and out.
   Vietnam claims it has about 50,000 troops in Cambodia. Western
diplomats in Beijing say the actual number is far larger.

   A police cruiser slammed into a pickup during a
chase on a rain-slick freeway, killing two police officers and
seriously injuring an officer-trainee, officials said today.
   The cruiser went out of control, crossed the median and collided
nearly head-on with the truck, said police spokesman Hollis Edwards.
The officers were pursuing a suspected stolen auto when the accident
happened Friday night.
   ``Information is still rather sketchy on why this wreck
occurred,'' Edwards said. ``We're still looking for the people these
officers were chasing.''
   The dead officers were identified as Lisa Sandel, 27, and her
partner, Officer Mark Fleming, 24, who died after emergency surgery
early today.
   The trainee, Nathaniel White, 25, was taken to Baylor University
Medical Center in Dallas and was in serious but stable condition
with head and internal injuries, police at the hospital said. White
entered the police academy last September.
   The driver of the pickup was taken to Charlton Methodist Hospital
in Duncanville, but his injuries were not believed to be serious, a
nursing supervisor said.
   Ms. Sandel and Fleming became the first Dallas Police Department
officers to die in the line of duty in 1989. Sandel joined the
department in March 1987, and Fleming also had been with the
department less than two years.
   Last year, a record five Dallas officers died in shootings either
on the job or at off-duty security jobs.

<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush headed back out on
the waters of the Florida Keys today on the last weekend before his
Inauguration, intent on capturing what he called ``pound for pound''
the world's most formidable fighting fish.
   Bush reeled in a 13-lb. bonefish on Friday in his first foray
this trip out on the Everglades side of the Keys, and regaled
reporters with details of the exploit today as he pulled away from a
private dock in a police boat.
   ``It really is excellent, just wonderful,'' said Bush, who is on
his third fishing or hunting trip since his election.
   The bonefish stripped off 150 yards of Bush's line before he
reeled it in, took a picture and threw it back from the 17-foot
skiff ``The Backlash'' that he fished from in the shallow waters.
   ``These are, pound for pound, I'd say, as fighting a fish as
there is in the world,'' said Bush.
   Spotting tourists sitting on a narrow dock where reporters and
photographers were recording his departure, Bush asked where they
were from.
   ``England,'' replied Maggie Arnold, a 52-year-old hairdresser
from Bournemouth.
   ``England! Are you?'' said Bush. ``Think Margaret Thatcher would
like a little of this bonefishing action?''
   The British visitor called the next president ``fantastic.''
   Bush said he would leave work on his inaugural speech until he
returns to Washington Sunday night. ``Not here,'' he said. ``When I
get back we'll get to more seriousness on that.''
   Bush's 13-pounder was just three pounds off the world record for
bonefish, said spokesman Stephen Hart.
   The vice president, an avid sportsman, told reporters at an
impromptu news conference after Air Force Two landed Friday at the
airport in Marathon, Fla., that he hoped to enjoy 48 hours in
``splendid isolation'' to ``clear the mind for the decisions that
lie ahead.''
   He blamed a flood of refugees from Nicaragua on ``tyranny'' in
that Marxist state, and he promised ``a hard new look at immigration
policy'' to help communities in Texas and Florida overburdened with
the refugees.
   Bush also said he is determined ``to focus all through my
presidency on my determination to help get rid of chemical and
biological weapons.'' He said the furor over the Libyan plant at
Rabta has enhanced worldwide understanding of the problem.
   West German officials are now investigating a German company the
United States believes helped Libya build a plant capable of making
poison gas.
   ``I think the Germans had a chance to analyze this evidence, but
I have never doubted Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl's commitment to the
control and the elimination of chemical weapons,'' Bush said.
   Bush's fishing buddies including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady; Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; Fred Zeder, a transition adviser;
Dr. Burton Lee, a New York cancer doctor; and Irish businessman and
raconteur Alphonse O'Brien. A local guide, George Hommel, was
leading the hunt from 17-foot, shallow-water skiffs.
   The three-day vacation is his third hunting or fishing trip since
the election, but Bush said he has no plans for a winter White House
here. In fact, he said, ``There will be no winter or summer White
Houses anyplace.''
   Bush said he envisions getting to his to his ocean home in
Kennebunkport, Maine, ``sometime, but the president is so
beautifully taken care of with Camp David and other arrangements
that I have no intention of building something else.''
   Bush said he probably won't get back to the Keys this winter, but
intends to fish often over the next eight years, proving ``I'm one
of the classic fishing conservationists ... and demonstrating my
keen personal interests in going after the wily bonefish, or the
elusive tarpon or the redfish or the snook that may be lying up
under that branch in the river up the Everglades.''
   Asked if he favors a ban on oil leasing in the Florida Keys,
Bush, a former oilman, said, ``What does that have to do with
fishing?''
   He said he was committed both to the environment and ``to prudent
development of our offshore resources.'' The country cannot risk
dependence on imported oil, he said. He said any development would
be done ``with total compatibility to our marine life and to other
environmental considerations.''
   Bush promised he would make no news while holed up here at a
private condominium development until Sunday. But he did offer one
domestic scoop: Millie, the family spaniel, is pregnant. ``We expect
puppies in the White House,'' he said.

   Two Palestinian girls died today from bullet
wounds suffered during clashes with Israeli troops, the army said,
bringing to four the number of Palestinians killed by army gunfire
in two days.
   Palestinian residents of Nablus, the largest city in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank, staged a mourning strike, and Arab
students left schools for marches to protest one of the killings,
said an Arab reporter there.
   Arab reports identified one of the victims as Hanadi Abu-Sultan.
The military command said the 12-year-old died at Israel's Tel
Hashomer Hospital after being shot Jan. 10 in a clash at Shati
refugee camp in Gaza City.
   In an apparent effort to prevent disturbances, the army clamped a
curfew on Shati, a beachside shantytown in Gaza City housing 42,000
Palestinians.
   Gaza merchants continued a commercial strike begun Friday to
protest Israeli raids to collect taxes. The strike was called by
PLO-linked leaders of the 13-month uprising. Non-payment of taxes is
a major tactic of the revolt against Israeli occupation.
   In east Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, 14-year-old Rana Al-Masri
died of wounds from a Jan. 7 clash in Nablus, the army said. Arab
reports said she was shot in the head with a plastic bullet.
   At least seven other Palestinian teen-agers, aged 13 to 18, were
wounded today in stone-throwing clashes with troops, doctors at
Nasser Hospital said. They included one teen shot in the chest and
another transferred to Tel Hashomer in serious condition with a
bullet wound to the head.
   On Friday, a 15-year-old Palestinian died in Mukassed Hospital of
wounds from a Thursday clash with troops in Gaza's Nuseirat refugee
camp.
   Another 15-year-old Arab boy was killed Friday at Dheishe refugee
camp near Bethlehem, where dozens of youths hurled stones at troops
who responded with tear gas, rubber bullets and, finally, live
ammunition.
   Today's deaths raise to at least 355 the number of Arabs killed
in the uprising which started in December 1987. Fifteen Israelis
have died.

<HEAD>Shevardnadze Promises Afghan Government Continued Soviet Aid</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Najib, one word, is correct.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
promised that his nation will give Afghanistan's beleaguered
government continued ``all-around assistance,'' Tass said today.
   The official Soviet news agency's report on talks between
Shevardnadze and Afghan President Najib appeared to indicate
Afghanistan will keep getting Soviet military aid, even after all
Red Army troops leave the country.
   Shevardnadze flew Friday to Kabul, Afghanistan's capital, as
Soviet officials continued working for a political solution
permitting them to withdraw their remaining 50,000 soldiers by Feb.
15.
   Soviet diplomats have hinted the Red Army may not complete with
withdrawal by the deadline, which was set at U.N.-brokered
negotiations in April 1988.
   Western diplomats, however, say the departure of Soviet troops
from Afghanistan, which was halted during the fall, has resumed.
   On Friday, reporters said 500 Soviet soldiers laden with military
equipment lined up before transport planes at Kabul airport, waiting
to fly home.
   The Soviets tried but failed to involve rebels fighting Najib's
government in peace talks with government representatives. Rebel
leaders say the Soviets only wanted to secure a place for Afghan
Marxists in a new Afghan government.
   Shevardnadze renewed the call for peace talks during his
discussions with Najib, but also clearly aligned himself with the
Afghan government, the Tass report indicated.
   ``The Soviet side confirmed its intention to continue playing an
intermediary role in launching a general dialogue in Afghanistan,''
Tass said.
   ``The Soviet side confirmed its full support for the Afghan
leadership's policies and said the Soviet Union will continue
extending the Republic of Afghanistan all-round assistance under
treaties and agreements concluded by the two countries,'' the news
agency said.
   Since the Soviets committed themselves to an Afghan withdrawal,
they have transferred millions of dollars worth of armaments and
military supplies to their Afghan allies, Western observers say.
   The Afghan government and the Soviets blame the guerrillas for
continuing hostilities because they have refused to join a
cease-fire proclaimed by Najib on Jan. 1.
   Soviet troops marched into Afghanistan in December 1979 to
preside over the replacement of one Marxist leader by another, and
the 100,000 soldiers stayed on to prop up the government against a
nationwide insurgency.

   Laser surgery on an 8-foot boa
constrictor's throat cancer turned a small university clinic into a
media zoo.
   The 12-minute operation Thursday drew cameras and reporters from
four television stations, an independent network and assorted
newspapers to the Beckman Laser Institute at the University of
California, Irvine.
   The patient was Sid Vicious, a snake named after the late rock n'
roll star and owned by Mission Viejo High School.
   The press presence was so great that a pool arrangement more
common to courtrooms and battleships had to be set up for television.
   Just before the surgery, Dr. Scott Weldy, a veterinarian, held up
the sleepy-looking boa and said: ``He's beginning to look a little
stupid now.'' The photo opportunity set lights flashing and cameras
whirring.
   The specialists took Sid into the operating room and stretched
him out on the table. A TV reporter's crew failed to capture the
scene on videotape.
   ``Why aren't we getting this?'' yelled the reporter, demanding
that the entry scene be repeated. Sid was taken off the operating
table, hauled back out, then made another entrance.
   Camera flashes continued as a red laser beam shot into Sid's
mouth.
   ``I think the camera flashes are bothering his eyes,'' Weldy
said. Cotton was taped over the snake's eyes and the laser therapy
continued, ultimately to be declared a success.

   When George Carlin's comedy routine on the
``seven dirty words'' was broadcast by a radio station in 1978, it
prompted a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on indecency.
   A decade later, a character on the hit network sitcom ``Designing
Women'' used a derivative of one of those words in describing
another character who was obsessed with enlarging her bosom.
   No, it isn't just imagination. Network standards are loosening up.
   ``The networks are being more lenient, and I think the reason is
a five-letter word _ C-A-B-L-E,'' said Harry Thomason, executive
producer of ``Designing Women.''
   Sexually explicit language and situations on network television
have produced occasional complaints, but audiences are apparently
rather blase after being presented a variety of R-rated cable fare,
not to mention videocassettes. A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates that 62.2
percent of U.S. homes with televisions also have a VCR.
   The networks, faced with remote-control ``grazing,'' cable
options and videocassettes, are having to loosen up or lose viewers.
   NBC, the No. 1 network, broadcast ``Favorite Son,'' a political
potboiler spiced up with scenes of sexual bondage.
   In an episode of ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' a wife crawled around
on the floor in search of a fumbled diaphragm.
   Last season, ``Saturday Night Live'' executive producer Lorne
Michaels complained about his battle with network censors over a
sketch whose purpose was to see how often actors could say the word
for the male sex organ on network TV. This season, the sketch got on
the air.
   ``The average family in a major urban center can have access to
30-plus different television signals, not to mention home video,
(where) they can see explicit language, full nudity and simulated
sex in far more graphic and strong ways than you've ever seen on
network television,'' says Alan Gerson, NBC vice president for
program marketing and administration.
   He says networks are loosening standards, but carefully keeping
back from the ``cutting edge'' of change.
   ``We're not changing first,'' Gerson said.
   Do viewers mind?
   ``I get a lot of discussion on it, but really when you sit down
and look at it and hear what's said, I don't really hear anybody
complaining,'' said Art Chapman of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram,
president of the Television Critics Association.
   ``The fact is,'' he said, ``whether you like it or not, it does
produce ratings, which means that people are watching it.''
   ``There are three groups of viewers out there,'' said Dorothy
Swanson, head of Virginia-based Viewers for Quality Television.
``There's your group that would really like to see more (explicit
material). They enjoy that. It's interesting, and it's entertaining,
and it's fun. ...
   ``Then there's another group that are your prudes who really feel
that there shouldn't be a single dirty word, no open-mouthed
kissing, no bedroom scenes. Those people are going to always object,
and they must be just screaming right about now.
   ``And then there's the group that just accepts it and keeps their
eye on it and turns the dial if they don't like it.''
   When the radio station broadcast Carlin's ``seven dirty words''
routine _ Carlin was explaining that there are seven words not
allowed to be broadcast _ a complaint to the Federal Communications
Commission prompted a lawsuit that led to the Supreme Court ruling.
The FCC does not get involved in network standards, but investigates
complaints against the stations that it licenses.
   A complaint about a network show would have to meet the FCC's
definition of indecency before action would be taken. Indecency is
described as ``patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards for the broadcast medium.''
   For network censors, ``community standards'' apply to a global
village, where a ``community'' can be a time period or a demographic
group. The changing expectations of television audiences have
changed the stereotypical scissor-wielding censor into something of
ad hoc sociologist.
   ``TV is a dynamic medium. It has to stay in touch with society.
It has to grow as society grows and deal with subjects that are
relevant to people's lives,'' said Matthew Margo, CBS vice president
for program practices.
   ``I think the objective here is not to go too far. It's to be
willing to grow, to be willing to take prudent risks, but never to
do anything that's going to offend a significant portion of our
viewing audience or advertisers or affiliates.''
   All three networks have cut back their standards and practices
departments to save money, but insist nothing has gotten on the air
that would not have before.
   The cutbacks have, however, ``increased the possibility of
risk,'' said Alfred R. Schneider, ABC vice president for broadcast
standards and practices, ``because you don't have an overview and
backup system that existed.''
   CBS and ABC have eliminated one level of censors and put a bigger
workload on supervisors. NBC eliminated its standards and practices
department completely, re-assigning most of its functions to the
entertainment division, which may be akin to the fox guarding the
henhouse.
   But NBC was no doubt chastened by its experience with Geraldo
Rivera's two-hour special ``Devil Worship: Exposing Satan's
Underground.''
   Though the sensationalistic special ranked No. 5 in the Nielsen
ratings for the week, NBC said it lost money because so many
advertisers pulled out. Gerson says the show was actually ``a
triumph'' for the remnants of the standards department, in view of
how much gruesome material was eliminated.
   During a recent presentation to television critics meeting in Los
Angeles, NBC Entertainment President Brandon Tartikoff was accosted
by an actor dressed as a priest and forced to swear on a stack of
Bibles that he would not air another Geraldo Rivera special.
   ``Devil Worship'' was attacked by television critics in part
because of its early time period, 8 p.m. EST, when presumably
children could be watching. In fact, much of the shift in standards
has taken place after 9 p.m. when networks assume mostly adults are
watching.
   An episode of NBC's 10 o'clock program ``L.A. Law'' opened in the
setting of a fertility clinic where a patient providing a sperm
sample moaned loudly from behind a bathroom door. It turned out he
was having trouble getting the lid off the specimen jar. In an
episode of the 9 p.m. ``Cheers'' on NBC, Sam the bartender was
stranded behind a table because of his state of sexual excitement.
   ``The standards really relate to the kind of program you're
dealing in,'' said Schneider. ``What may work in a 10 o'clock
program, like `thirtysomething,' ... would be totally inappropriate
to an 8 o'clock program.''
   One way standards departments have cut their workload is by
paying less attention to such G-rated shows as ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   But even ``Designing Women,'' which often tackles sexual
subjects, has found the going easier of late, said Thomason, whose
wife, Linda Bloodworth-Thomason writes most of the scripts.
   Thomason said the show has had a good relationship with the
censors, but he nevertheless was surprised that the questionable
breast word was approved. The censor, after seeing the script,
wanted to ``reserve judgment.''
   ``A lot of times, if we disagree with them, we'll say, `Look, why
don't you let us shoot it and we'll shoot an alternative, and see
how it's used and how it looks in the context of the show,'''
Thomason said. ``Fortunately, I don't remember a time when we've
done that they didn't come back later and say, `OK, we see what you
were going for, and it's OK.'''

<HEAD>Los Angeles County Gang Killings Set Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than one person died in a gang-related
killing for every day of 1988 in Los Angeles County, said
authorities who blamed the record number of deaths on turf and drug
battles fought by well-armed street hoods.
   Altogether, there were 452 gang-related slayings in the county,
according to statistics compiled by all area law enforcement
agencies and released by the sheriff's department on Friday.
   ``It's staggering,'' sheriff's Sgt. Wes McBride said. ``We're in
a crisis. They're still killing as fast as ever. I don't see any
indication it'll go down.''
   ``There's more than one a day,'' said V.G. Guinses, a gang
counselor. ``That doesn't include kids on life support, or people
handicapped or paralyzed'' by bullet wounds.
   The slayings surpassed the previous record of 387 gang-related
murders reported the year before, McBride said.
   Earlier in the week, the Los Angeles police department reported
that gang slayings in its jurisdiction reached a record 257 in 1988
compared with 205 the year before.
   Some authorities blamed the increased carnage on the more
sophisticated weapons that gang members are purchasing with profits
from illegal drug sales.
   More semiautomatic, military-style assault weapons are being
confiscated from gang members, authorities say.
   ``I think the major factor is the weapons,'' said Los Angeles
police Deputy Chief William Rathburn. ``These are dangerous weapons.
They're good for one thing _ killing people. There are a lot of them
out there. An enormous number.''

<HEAD>U.S. Marines Return To Vietnam On Good Will Mission</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six former U.S. Marines landed in Vietnam
on Saturday in peace, 24 years after the first American combat
troops hit the beaches of Da Nang in war.
   ``Man, it brought so many memories, looking out at them rice
paddies,'' said Frank Noe, a 40-year-old firefighter from Stoughton,
Mass.
   ``Just seeing the children ... to me when I was real young here _
18, 19 years old _ I always felt for the children and I think that's
what brought me back here, too. I had a real warm feeling for all
those people. It's an honest-to-God feeling.''
   Gazing at the mountains in the distance, Nate Genna, a
41-year-old maintenance man from Boston, thought of his days as a
19-year-old Marine under fire from North Vietnamese gunners hidden
in similar mountains in South Vietnam. ``They look awfully
familiar,'' he said. ``They're not the same ones, but they look the
same.''
   The former Marines are self-styled unofficial ambassadors of good
will, hoping their 10-day visit will bring other veterans back and
better relations between the two countries.
   ``As long as we can get veterans back over here to see what's
going on here and to let the world know that these are fantastic,
wonderful people, and they need help _ if we can get that across to
the American people I'd be happy,'' said Mike Wallace, a 41-year-old
farmer from Langdon, Kan.
   The other former Marines include Gene Spanos, 39, a Rosemont,
Ill., police lieutenant; William Johnson, 41, of Manchester, Conn.,
a maker of electric signs; and Robert Dalton, a 54-year-old
free-lance writer from Davidsonville, Md.
   Their patrol into the past, a journey to heal their own pain as
much as to look their former foes in the eyes, will take them to
what is no more _ the demilitarized zone along the 17th parallel
that once divided Vietnam into North and South.
   The 11th Marine Battalion, 3rd Marine Division, in which all of
the men except Dalton served, planted about 100,000 land mines to
protect a string of U.S. outposts along the DMZ named Cam Lo, Con
Thien Gio Linh and Dong Ha.
   After North Vietnam defeated the South in 1975, it reunified the
country. Vietnamese officials say thousands of civilians were killed
clearing the land mines for farming and housing in postwar Vietnam,
but they say all the mines are gone.
   The Marines are not so sure. Concerned that the mines are still
causing civilian casualties, they want to attempt to verify the
Vietnamese claims.
   ``It's a sense of accomplishment, given a chance to come back to
a country where we fought,'' said Spanos. ``We're looking forward to
meeting the Vietnamese soldiers.''
   Johnson said he was unsure of himself when he arrived at Hanoi's
international airport. ``As I remember Vietnam, you had to be
looking over your shoulder, and that's history now but still you're
very unsure when you're going through customs. Everybody's in
uniform.''
   His anxiety soon vanished, wiped away by the charm and
friendliness of the Vietnamese children.
   ``I'm glad I came,'' said Johnson.
   ``None of us can describe what the emotion we feel is,'' said
Wallace. ``It's different now,'' said Noe. ``Nothing wrong is
happening.''

<TEXT>
   Machine guns jut from the walls of Col.
Moammar Gadhafi's compound, the army is building roadblocks, and
anti-aircraft batteries point north toward the Mediterranean in case
the Americans come again.
   Officials and ordinary Libyans in the streets express fear of
attack. The bomb-shattered former French Embassy in the heart of
Tripoli is a daily reminder of American ability to strike.
   Some diplomats say the mood reminds them of the days before the
U.S. air raids on Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986, intended as
punishment for Libya's alleged support of international terrorism.
   Gadhafi speaks defiantly about the possibility of a U.S. attack,
but the diplomats believe he has genuine fear of one.
   They said Gadhafi believes the decision has been made to attack a
plant at Rabta, 60 miles outside Tripoli, and other targets. The
Americans say the plant is to manufacture chemical weapons. Libya
says it will make pharmaceuticals.
   A Western diplomat said his first impression had been that Libyan
officials were ``not really worried, that their talk about the
American menace was for domestic consumption. Later, after talking
with them day after day, I became convinced they are really scared.''
   He and the others spoke on condition their names not be revealed.
   In downtown Tripoli, heavy machine guns manned by soldiers in
olive fatigues rested on the white walls, 25 feet high, around the
leader's fortified compound. Diplomats said the number of guns had
been increased.
   Camouflaged tanks and anti-aircraft batteries were positioned in
a line of trees behind a high brown wall a few blocks from the
compound.
   Reporters taken by bus to the desert southwest of Tripoli, near
the Rabta plant, saw surface-to-air missiles aimed northward, toward
the sea. Radar scanned from a barren ridge and troops manned
roadblocks on the highways.
   One diplomat said the army might be keeping tabs on dissident
Moslem fundamentalists returning from Tunisia and Sudan, but another
said roadblocks were common in tense times and these could be linked
to the fear of attack.
   ``They seem to be afraid the Americans could pop up in a jeep
somewhere along the highway,'' said an envoy from Western Europe.
``I don't know why they think a roadblock could catch a convoy of
American troops.''
   European and Arab diplomats say Libya has asked their governments
repeatedly in the past few weeks to use their influence with the
Americans.
   Some feel the momentum of accusation and tension between the
United States and Libya will be difficult to stop. A European said,
for example, that Washington had ``maneuvered itself into a
difficult position by talking so loudly.''
   Several Europeans expressed the belief President Reagan was
obsessed with Gadhafi.
   ``Every American president has his own favorite top enemy,'' one
said. ``For Reagan it is Gadhafi, although I can't imagine anybody
really takes Gadhafi seriously as a No. 1 enemy.''
   They agreed the Libyan leader could be counted on to play into
Reagan's hands with bluster and threats of terrorist reprisal. As
one put it: ``Gadhafi is the worst spokesman for his country.''
   Despite all this, the Europeans said they felt Gadhafi was
serious in requesting direct negotiations with the incoming
administration of George Bush. They also said more moderate members
of his government were encouraging such proposals.
   ``People in the government ... believed that the policy of
confrontation in the mind of Gadhafi would lead to disaster,'' one
said.
   In the past year, Libya has tried to improve relations with
Europe and its North African neighbors, according to the diplomats.
   Most shops and cafes in Tripoli were closed a year ago. Now they
are open, although poorly supplied.
   A few blue-and-white sack dresses from Tunisia hung in a clothing
store. The next window held a sparse display of faucets and other
plumbing supplies. Cans of Pepsi-Cola rested on nearly empty cafe
shelves.
   Libyans now can talk and travel more freely, but diplomats and
others said the slight liberalization has created problems for
Gadhafi. They said a growing, more organized opposition worries him
and there are signs of greater activism among Moslem fundamentalists.
   The Moslem Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group the government
says tried to overthrow Gadhafi in 1984, has held demonstrations at
Al Fateh University in Tripoli. Anti-Gadhafi slogans appeared on
campus walls recently but were painted over quickly, said a source
associated with professors at Al Fateh.
   European diplomats say Gadhafi remains the only powerful man in
Libya and will allow only so much openness and dissent before
cracking down.
   ``The reforms can only go so far, only what he can control,'' one
said. ``Then he will put a stop to it.''

   NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact agreed
today to hold new talks to reduce conventional forces in Europe,
diplomats said. The agreement came after Greece and Turkey settled a
territorial dispute.
   Negotiators from the world's two most powerful military alliances
initialed the agreement calling for the new arms talks, said a
Western diplomat who attended the closed-door session. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Diplomats also prepared to sign a landmark human rights accord
later today that was informally accepted Friday by the East and West
blocs and 12 neutral nations. Resolution of the Greece-Turkey
dispute paved the way for the signing.
   U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze will join 33 other foreign ministers at a
three-day meeting, starting Tuesday, to wind up the 35-nation
Helsinki review conference.
   One Western diplomat said the Greek-Turkish dispute was resolved
after last-minute telephone calls between Vienna and the Turkish
capital, Ankara.
   Another Western envoy, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
indicated the dispute was settled after the Soviet Union and three
unidentified NATO countries submitted letters to Turkey. Their
content was not disclosed.
   The arms talks, dubbed the Negotations on Conventional Armed
Forces in Europe, could start as early as March, diplomats say.
   The call for the talks will be included in a 35-nation agreement
designed to ensure freedom of religion and travel by citizens of
East bloc nations and to boost East-West contacts at all levels.
   The Greek-Turkish dispute over a strategic corner of Turkish
territory close to the border with Syria had threatened to unravel
both the call for new East-West arms talks and the Helsinki
conference accord.
   The Balkan nations deadlocked over the possible inclusion of a
strategic region of Turkey, the Eastern Mediterranean port of
Mersin, in the new arms talks on reducing conventional forces in
Europe.
   Greece insisted that the port be included in those talks. Athens
had insisted that Mersin is a key port for shipping supplies to
northern Cyprus, which is controlled by Turkey.
   It was not immediately clear how the two nations had reached a
compromise on their dispute, but the compromise reportedly put off
the question of whether Mersin would be included in the new talks.
   Western diplomats have praised the human rights accord, which
contains landmark provisions on human rights, including enhanced
religious freedoms, clearer regulations on travel and emigration
from the East bloc, more freedom of information and an end to the
abuse of psychiatry.
   Western diplomats also hailed as a triumph the achievement for
the first time of a mechanism allowing Helsinki signatory states to
raise human rights affairs with one another.
   The 1975 Helsinki Final Act was signed by the Soviet Union, the
United States, Canada and all European nations except Albania.
   Many of its human rights provisions have been violated in the
past by the East bloc. Western diplomats noted the new Vienna
accords had been made possible by the recent reforms in the Soviet
Union, but stressed the test would come in whether the East's
Communist nations adhere to it.
   Human rights are to be discussed at annual follow-up conferences,
in Paris this summer, in Copenhagen next year and in Moscow in 1991.
   The Moscow conference was disputed into the last weeks of the
Helsinki review forum. The United States and Britain eventually
agreed to go, but only if Soviet reforms continue and are
institutionalized.

<HEAD>The Marks Of Smoot May Soon Be Moot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Smoot marks are vanishing from the
Massachusetts Avenue Bridge, and the 30-year legacy of Oliver R.
Smoot Jr. and his fraternity brothers may soon be just another MIT
legend.
   ``There's no item in our contract concerning the replacement of
Smoots,'' said Ed McInnis, superintendent for Modern Continental
Construction Co., the general contractor on the bridge repair job.
   Late one night in October 1958, members of Lambda Chi Alpha at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology used Smoot to blaze a new
trail in distance measurement and fraternity prankdom.
   Smoot's 5-feet-7 frame was manhandled, length by length, to
measure the distance of the span crossing the Charles River, which
is also known as the Harvard Bridge. The idea was to let strollers
know how far they had to go.
   The fraternity brothers painted Smootmarks on the bridge walkway:
``10 Smoots,'' ``20 Smoots,'' and so on, reporting that the distance
they measured was ``364.4 Smoots, plus one ear.''
   Successive fraternity members have repainted the Smoots twice a
year. But the work to replace the cracked and corroded bridge has
already destroyed the Smoots on the bridge's west sidewalk. If the
repair timetable goes as expected, the east Smoots will be gone by
fall.
   The construction crew says the remaining Smoots could be saved if
someone foots the bill. Labor Steward Henry Troville said the Smoots
could be cut out of the old concrete and implanted in the new.
   But he didn't think much of that idea, saying the 60 or so coats
of paint make the Smoot lines very slippery. ``I've seen many
bicyclists brought down by the Smoots,'' he told The Boston Globe.
   Smoot, now 48, an executive vice president of a Washington-based
computer and business equipment association, said he is optimistic
about the ultimate fate of the Smoot.
   He said there may be a future for a microSmoot or a kiloSmoot.
``I understand that the yard got its start as the length of the
king's arm and the inch was the width of a knuckle,'' he said.
   But there is a move among students to ``reSmoot'' the rebuilt
bridge using the original's son, Stephen R. Smoot, 21, an MIT
junior. He has not yet committed himself to the project.
   The junior Smoot also cautioned that his height, 5-feet-11, would
result in a different calibration.
   But reSmooting the bridge would correct an error. The original
group overlooked a bridge section that spans Storrow Drive on the
Boston side of the river.
   ``So they were off by approximately 26.87 Smoots, give or take an
ear,'' McInnis said.

   The flag-draped casket of an American pilot killed in
the 1986 bombing raid on Libya was put aboard a U.S. Air Force
transport plane that left for the United States today, a day after
Libya released the body.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Dillen said the body was identified
Friday night as that of Air Force Maj. Fernando Ribas-Dominicci who
died during the raid on Libya in the early hours of April 15, 1986.
   Dillen said the plane was headed for a U.S. military base at
Dover, Del. The hometown of the pilot, who was 33 at his death, is
Utuado, Puerto Rico.
   During a brief ceremony at the military airport, U.S. Ambassador
Maxwell Rabb and Charge d'Affaires James F. Creagan placed hand over
heart as six Marines carried the casket past them to a C-141
aircraft. Rabb is ambassador to Italy and Creagan is assigned to the
Vatican.
   Dillen said he did not know why the Libyans said the body they
flew to Rome on Friday was that of Capt. Paul Lorence, 31, of San
Francisco, the other airman aboard the F-111.
   ANSA, the Italian news agency, today quoted an Italian forensic
expert who helped identify the body as saying, ``The identification
was made possible on the basis of the comparision of teeth'' with
documents provided by U.S. authorities. Three Italian and three
American medical experts conducted the examination, said ANSA.
   The bomber was the only plane lost in the raids on Tripoli,
Libya's capital, and Benghazi, another coastal city.
   Libyan authorities, in what they called part of ``humanitarian
initiatives,'' presented the body to the Vatican on Friday in the
rubble of the former headquarters of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,
a target in the raid, according to Libya's JANA news agency. The
Tripoli site never was rebuilt.
   Ribas-Dominicci's body was flown by military aircraft to Rome,
where Italian authorities took possession of the gold-trimmed, white
coffin in a simple ceremony at Ciampino Airport. A Libyan soldier in
green fatigues gently laid a wreath of red flowers atop the casket
before Italian air force officers carried it to a mortuary van.
   The gesture came during a period of international debate over a
Libyan plant that the United States says can produce chemical
weapons, and nine days after U.S. fighters shot down two Libyan jets
over the Mediterranean. U.S. officials said the Libyan fighters
acted in a threatening manner. Libya claimed the planes were unarmed
and were downed in a premeditated attack.
   JANA, monitored in Rome and London, said U.S. fighter planes
buzzed a Libyan Airlines plane flying to Istanbul on Tuesday. The
Pentagon said it had no information about the incident.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman welcomed
the return of the remains and said the action was part of Libya's
humanitarian obligations.
   Gadhafi was quoted as saying in a Dec. 24 dispatch that he was
returning the body ``especially since this occasion coincides with
the end of the rule of the Reagan administration.''
   Reagan ordered the 1986 attack in retaliation for what he called
Libya's support for terrorists.
   The other 17 U.S. Air Force bombers involved in the raid returned
safely after dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the cities.

   Iran has formed a task force to combat an
expected invasion of crop-devouring locusts from central Africa, the
Islamic Republic News Agency said Saturday.
   The report, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a task force official in
southeastern Bushehr province as saying,``We predict that from about
mid-January to mid-March, the locusts will swarm over our southern
border areas.''
   The official said a few mostly young locusts were spotted in the
past two days but that the problem was not yet serious. IRNA quoted
the official as saying locust-spraying planes were on alert.
   Locusts started swarming into the Arabian peninsula in October in
what experts have called the worst such invasion in nearly 30 years.
   The locusts can devour twice their body-weight every day. Saudi
Arabia already has been hit by about 350 locust swarms.

<TEXT>
   Elliott Abrams returns to private life next
week after 3{ tumultuous years as President Reagan's top aide for
Latin America, and much of the city's foreign policy establishment
is abuzz over the question of who will succeed him.
   Outside the cabinet itself, few presidential appointments have
generated more interest and curiosity about who President-elect Bush
will select for what is widely regarded as one of the toughest jobs
in government.
   The job carries an imposing title, assistant secretary of state
for inter-American affairs; a spacious paneled office on the sixth
floor of the State Department, and enough headaches to keep a
medium-sized pharmaceutical company in business. The task involves
dealing with issues ranging from drugs to debt in 33 hemispheric
countries.
   The Bush transition team is said by several sources to have
reduced the list of candidates to replace Abrams to five, four of
whom are foreign service officers.
   The only non-diplomat is Robert Helander, 67, a New York lawyer
who has had a long-time association with Rockefeller family business
interests in Latin America.
   But State Department officials said Helander's prospects seemed
to fade when he left an unfavorable impression on Capitol Hill
staffers during get-acquainted sessions earlier this month.
   The other candidates said to be on Bush's short list for Abrams'
job are:
   _Deane Hinton, ambassador to Costa Rica and a former ambassador
to El Salvador. One of his strengths is knowledge of economic issues
facing the hemisphere.
   _Everett Briggs, ambassador to Honduras who dealt with Central
American issues at the State Department during the early Reagan
years. He also was ambassador to Panama.
   _John Negroponte, a former ambassador to Honduras who serves as
deputy to National Security adviser Colin Powell. Some conservatives
oppose his appointment, contending his support for the Nicaraguan
Contras is only lukewarm.
   _Craig Johnstone, a former ambassador to Algeria who was the top
adviser on Central America under Abrams' predecessor, Tony Motley.
Johnstone has been actively pursuing the assistant secretary post
and has told friends he will leave the foreign service if the job
goes to someone else. He also has detractors in the conservative
camp.
   Much of the interest in the identity of Abrams' successor stems
from the uncertainty about the course Bush will follow on the two
dominant hemispheric issues: Central America and Latin America's
$420 billion foreign debt.
   Bush is expected to pursue a policy of continuity in most areas
of the world but he is considered by most experts as likely to try
new directions on Latin policy.
   The air of uncertainty has been fueled by the almost total
absence of discussion about Central America, particularly Nicaragua,
since well before the fall presidential election campaign.
   Once an issue of highest priority for the administration, Reagan
made no mention of Nicaragua or Central America in his summation
this past week of his eight years in office.
   Abrams, in a speech Thursday about the Reagan legacy in Latin
America, gave only a passing reference to Nicaragua and did not
mention the Contras at all.
   Bush will take office with the bulk of the Contra force stationed
at camps inside the Honduran border, surviving on U.S.-donated food
and other humanitarian supplies. Congress cut off military aid last
February and Bush has left unclear what plans he has for the Contras.
   Some transition team members have indicated privately that the
new administration may open talks with the Sandinista government, a
clear break with the Reagan policy of giving Managua the diplomatic
cold shoulder.
   One possible option for Bush would be to abandon the Reagan goal
of seeking a democratic outcome in Nicaragua and instead seek an
accommodation with the Sandinistas in return for promises of a
reduced Soviet-bloc role there.
   On the debt question, Bush has left the impression he will seek
new approaches that will have the effect of easing Latin repayment
obligations.

<HEAD>More Burmese Students Return Under Controversial Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-eight Burmese students returned home
Saturday under a controversial program in which Thailand repatriates
people who fled last year's bloody military crackdown in Burma.
   The flight brought to 320 the number of students and other
Burmese who have returned under the program, which was established
last month by the Thai and Burmese military.
   Only one Burmese remained at the repatriation center at
Thailand's northern city of Tak, a 20-year-old student hospitalized
with malaria, Thai officials said.
   The Burmese had fled to Thai border areas controlled by
anti-government guerrillas, seeking refuge after the September
military coup in Burma and the ruthless suppression of pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   Under the Thai-Burmese program, they are brought to the Tak
center, then flown to Burma's capital of Rangoon aboard Burmese
military planes.
   Interviewed upon arrival in Rangoon, chemistry student Kyaw Kyaw
Aung said many students from the border areas were expected to reach
the Tak camp in a few days.
   Asked about allegations they were being forced back to Burma,
another student, Maung Nay Win, said: ``We were looked after very
well by the Thai Red Cross, like their children. There was no threat
or pressure to force us back to Burma. We returned at our own
volition.''
   Other students have told reporters, however, that they would
remain in Thailand if they could.
   Both the Thai and Burmese governments have denied charges by
Amnesty International that Thailand forced back 22 students on Jan.
7 and that some of them were arrested when they arrived in Burma.

<HEAD>Airline Apologizes for Mistreatment of Double Amputee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An airline apologized to a double amputee
passenger after employees put him on a baggage dolly ``like a sack
of potatoes,'' verbally abused him in front of other passengers and
treated him so roughly that at one point they pulled off his pants.
   Fred Hankin, 66, had a first-class ticket aboard a Pan American
Airlines flight on Jan. 9 from his former home in New York to San
Jose.
   But Hankin was so mistreated by airline personnel that his
nostalgic trip home became a memory of bitter humiliation, said his
daughter, Sheila Byers of San Carlos.
   ``It's hard to believe that people could be so insensitive and we
will take whatever measures are needed,'' said Pan Am official
Gustavo Serrano, who acknowledged that Hankin was mistreated by
employees.
   Hankin had both his legs amputated at the groin because of a
circulation problem he developed in the Army. He has no tailbone and
no hips so balancing in a chair without help is difficult for him,
his daughter said.
   But despite special arrangements made prior to the trip, Hankin
ran into trouble, Byers said.
   After transferring to an alternate flight because of a six-hour
delay, Hankin was placed on a baggage cart ``like a sack of
potatoes'' and wheeled onto the plane where he waited 45 minutes as
other passengers stared at him, Byers said.
   When Byers protested the lack of first-class seating, she said
she was told by the gate agent: ``If he's that sick, he shouldn't be
on a plane; he should be in a hospital.''
   After a passenger offered Hankin his seat near the more roomy
bulkhead, an airline employee transferred him in such a way that his
pants fell off, Byers said.
   And when Byers explained that she needed a seat next to her
father to help him use a hand-held urinal, she said the agent
ordered the rest of the crew: ``If she opens her mouth again I want
her kicked off the plane.''
   Serrano said Pan Am would offer Hankin compensation, but he did
not elaborate.

   Two U.S. helicopters today rescued 32 people from a
Cypriot freighter battered by gale-force winds and heavy waves in
the Atlantic.
   ``Everyone is off,'' a duty officer at the Coast Guard Maritime
Rescue Center at Falmouth reported, about an hour and 15 minutes
after the two MH53-J helicopters had reached the 42,000-ton
Yarrowanga.
   There was no report of any injuries to the crew members, who were
lifted by winches into the helicopters, the officer said.
   The listing ship, which was bound from Norway to the St. Lawrence
Seaway in Canada to take on iron ore, suffered one large gash below
the waterline on the right side of the hull and a larger hole higher
up on the left side.
   The ship's boiler had failed for a time on Friday, but it was
restarted and the ship had been moving under its own power.
   Fifteen people were taken aboard one helicopter and the other 17
were on the second rescue craft, which were returning to Shannon
International Airport in Ireland. Those aboard included the German
master, his wife and 30 Filipino seamen. An earlier report said only
31 people had been aboard.
   The rescue, about 200 miles west of the Irish coast, was
completed quickly despite winds in excess of 40 mph and 30-foot seas.
   The helicopters, based at Woodridge-Bentwaters 70 miles east of
London, were refueled en route by two long-range HC-130 Hercules
tanker aircraft, which are specially designed for long-range rescue
work.
   A spokesman for Britain's Minister of Defense said the Royal Air
Force had no helicopters capable of in-flight refueling.
   The rescue center said a Dutch tug, the Typhoon, was expected to
reach the Yarrowanga on Sunday and attempt to salvage it.
   The Royal Air Force Rescue Center in Plymouth said the ship had
lost 120 square yards of plating below the waterline on the right
side and about 200 meters of plating above the water on the left.
   Two British Royal Air Force Nimrod reconnaissance planes from St.
Mawgan in Cornwall, southwest England, reached the bulk carrier
before dark on Friday and took pictures, showing a gaping hole in
its left side and three hatches open.
   Relays of Nimrods, designed for long searching at sea, circled
the ship overnight.

   A car slammed into two trucks belonging to

   Two trucks were parked at the midtown Manhattan intersection
about 4:15 a.m. when the car slammed into the first truck, careened

Mohrmann, a police department spokeswoman.
   The driver,Marrius Marek, a member of a Polish dance company, was
charged with driving while intoxicated, Mohrmann said. He was being

<TEXT>
   A month after his kidnappers said they
would kill him, the fate of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, who
turns 44 on Sunday, remains a mystery.
   The last word on the American, kidnapped in south Lebanon 11
months ago, came Dec.12 when his pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors
said they had sentenced him to death for spying for Israel.
   No body has been found.
   The Organization for the Oppressed on Earth, which claimed
responsibility for Higgins' abduction, has also claimed
responsibility for kidnapping 12 Lebanese Jews since 1984 and has
said it killed eight of them. Four bodies have been found.
   However, a Shiite source, familiar with the thinking of
pro-Iranian factions, said he did not believe Higgins has been slain.
   ``He's too valuable a card to be wasted,'' said the source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``He's an American officer who had held sensitive posts in the
United States. He also served with the United Nations. This makes
him an American national security interest and an international
interest,'' the source said.
   Higgins is one of 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held
hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is American journalist
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Higgins, of Danville, Ky., led a 76-man U.N. military observer
group monitoring the Lebanon-Israel border when he was kidnapped
Feb. 17, 1988.
   Two days later, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth issued
a statement claiming the abduction and charging that Higgins spied
for the ``satanic CIA.''
   The United States and the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon, to which
Higgins' observer group was attached, denied he was a spy.
   The kidnappers originally said they would release Higgins if
Israel withdrew from territory it occupies in south Lebanon; if all
Lebanese and Palestinians held by Israel and its militia allies were
freed; and if the United States halted alleged involvement in
efforts to crush a Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied
territories.
   Five days after the kidnapping, the group released a 70-second
videotape of Higgins in which he repeated his captors' demands.
   On Feb.25, about 10,000 people demonstrated in Moslem west Beirut
chanting ``death to Higgins.''
   The pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, believed to be the parent
organization for Shiite factions holding most of hostages, declared
its support for Higgins' kidnapping April 11.
   Hezbollah's chief spokesman, Sheik Ibrahim el-Amin, told a Beirut
news conference that Higgins was ``not kidnapped, but detained.''
   ``We haven't been involved in his detention, but we support it,''
he said.
   In a statement April 21, the kidnappers dropped their offer to
free Higgins and said he would be stand trial ``for the crimes he
has committed.''
   It accused him of taking part in ``American conspiracies''
against Moslems and supervising ``a Pentagon team to combat Lebanese
and Palestinian Islamic organizations.''
   The Organization of the Oppressed on Earth said in a statement
issued in December, ``We have issued the irrevocable sentence to
execute this American spy.''

   More than 200 protesters were arrested today as
an anti-abortion group continued to defy a federal judge's order to
stop blocking entrances to clinics.
   About 100 people from Operation Rescue were arrested this morning
in front of Planned Parenthood's Margaret Sanger Center, said a
police spokeswoman, Sgt. Tina Mohrmann. They were among about 600
demonstrators at the site.
   The remainder were arrested at other locations throughout
Manhattan, police said.
   An Operation Rescue spokesman, Bob Chuvala, said people were
linked together by chain in three locations.
   The people chained themselves together to ``slow things down'' as
long ``as we possibly can to save as many babies as we can,''
Chuvala said.
   On Friday, about 1,000 members of the anti-abortion group defied
a federal judge's order and twice blocked the entrance to the
Margaret Sanger Center.
   Police arrived and those Operation Rescue protesters not arrested
Friday morning left, only to return en masse several hours later and
lay down in front of the clinic.
   One hundred seventy-six people were arrested, and all were
charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. They refused
to give their names and were held for arraignment, said Officer
Edward Feeney.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Ward issued a permanent injunction
against the Binghamton-based group on Tuesday, forbidding members to
obstruct access to abortion clinics in New York City.
   The order calls for a fine of $25,000 a day for violations.
   Joan Coombs, deputy executive director of Planned Parenthood,
said the organization planned to seek a contempt charge against
Operation Rescue.

   A 29-year-old woman who had been treated for
infertility gave birth early Saturday to four girls and two boys,
the first sextuplets recorded in France, doctors said.
   Coralie, Gaelle, Melanie, Doriane, Cedric and Kevin were born by
Caesarean section at a maternity clinic at Port Royale, in southern
Paris. All were in good health, the clinic said.
   The mother, Marie Claude Adam, gave birth after 32{ weeks of
pregnancy, said her doctor, Gaston Verdonck. The infants' weights
ranged from 2.9 pounds to 3.28 pounds, he said.
   Mrs. Adam and her husband, Daniel, live in the Eure region of
Normandy, but she was transferred to Paris for the birth.
   ``I can't yet realize what is happening,'' Mrs. Adam said at the
end of November. ``It's extraordinary to be expecting six children.''
   Neighbors in their town of Louviers formed a group, ``Live and
Give Life,'' to collect gifts and supplies for the family.
   Daniel Adam works at a Renault factory. Mrs. Adam had been
working at a shoe factory.

   The sisters, who are listed as the world's oldest living
identical twins by the Guinness Book of World Records, celebrated at
their home in the Mountain Vista Health Park. The two women lived in
Davidson County all their lives, never more than two miles apart,
and moved to the rest home two years ago.
   ``It's the Lord that has kept us here this long,'' Mrs. Hill said.
   Between them, Mrs. Hill and Mrs. Lambeth had 20 children, 15 of
whom are living. They have 48 grandchildren, 90 great-grandchildren
and 31 great-great-grandchildren.
   Hazel Briles, 67, the second-youngest of Mrs. Lambeth's nine
children, said her mother kept her house spotless and her yard raked
until she was in her 90s.
   ``She just enjoyed doing things like that,'' Mrs. Briles said.
``She was a real active person. Most everybody in our family is real
active.''
   The two sisters rely on each other for companionship, and somehow
manage to keep each other going, Mrs. Briles said.
   ``They just don't make them like that anymore,'' she said.

   Fifteen gifts that blew off the roof of a van
on Interstate 80 on Christmas Eve have been returned to a couple by
a state roads worker who tracked them down through a department
store label.
   Michael and Julianne Wiegel of Lafayette, Colo., lost the
Christmas presents as they drove through Nebraska but did not
discover the gifts were missing until they arrived at the home of
relatives in Wisconsin.
   ``I was in tears,'' Mrs. Wiegel said. ``At that point, I figured
a Nebraska wheat farmer probably would find them in his field next
spring.''
   David Luusua, a maintenance worker for the Nebraska Roads
Department, found the packages that same day, strewn along the
shoulder of Interstate 80 about a mile west of the Platte River
bridge, between Omaha and Lincoln.
   Jerry Johnson, maintenance office supervisor, said the workers
called the State Patrol, but no one claimed the gifts over the next
week or so. Johnson then began some detective work.
   ``Some of the packages had skidded on the pavement and I noticed
the wrapping on one had torn,'' Johnson said. ``I saw a label on one
of the boxes from a department catalog store and it was addressed to
a lady in Lafayette, Colo.''
   Johnson said he called the woman and told her what he had found
and she identified them.
   ``I was really surprised,'' Mrs. Wiegel said.

   Tourists could thank their lucky stars for
Friday the 13th at the Betsy Ross House.
   Nearly 600 people received 13-star flags Friday at the home of
the woman who many believe designed the first American flag,
according to William Kingsley, executive director of the house a few
blocks from the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall.
   ``It's fantastic,'' Kingsley said. ``We probably have five times
as many visitors as we did on a comparable day a year ago. The
weather is good and that helps.''
   Visitors received 12-inch-by-18-inch flags, which the house also
hands out each Flag Day.
   They included a tour bus from a New York high school for Hispanic
and Far Eastern immigrants, who received an extra flag for their
principal. Kingsley said the group's teacher had told the students
in Spanish to thank Kingsley in English.
   ``It was touching,'' he said.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tass said today the story it ran about six men
rescued from a collapsed building 35 days after the Armenian
earthquake may have been a hoax.
   On Thursday, the official news agency quoted Aikaz Akopyan, 50,
as saying he and five other men were rescued Wednesday after
surviving on canned goods in a building that collapsed in Leninakan
during the Dec. 7 earthquake.
   On Friday, Tass reported it could not confirm Akopyan's story,
and today the news agency said Akopyan's sister indicated the story
was made up to get Akopyan into a good hospital in Yerevan, the
capital of Armenia.
   However, Tass said Akopyan was sticking to his story, that
doctors could not rule it out, and that reporters were still
checking details of the case.
   Tass said Akopyan had threatened to jump out the window of his
hospital room if journalists continued to question him about his
story and that doctors were taking the threat seriously.
   Reporters of the Armenian news agency Armenpress found Akopyan's
sister, Julietta, who allegedly had met him as he was rescued
Wednesday but then disappeared, Tass said.
   ``At first the sister denied being related to Akopyan but then
admitted that she took Aikaz to the Yerevan hospital and that he
indeed is her brother. It follows from her words that Aikaz turned
to her on Jan. 6 with a request to take him to a good Yerevan
hospital,'' Tass said.
   ``Along the road to Yerevan the legend of being saved after 35
days was supposedly thought up,'' Tass said.
   None of the other five people who allegedly were trapped in the
basement of a nine-story apartment building with Akopyan have been
found.
   Officials gave up hope weeks ago of finding more survivors in the
Dec. 7 quake, which killed 25,000 people. They began bulldozing the
ruins in Leninakan and other cities to prevent decaying bodies from
spreading disease.
   Tass said today that Professor Gurgen Badanyan, a leading Soviet
internal medicine specialist, believed Akopyan had been suffering
from chronic lung and heart deficiencies for at least several years.
   Akopyan was initially reported to be suffering from pneumonia.
   A psychiatric exam indicated that Akopyan is not mentally ill,
but doctors observed that he mixed up some facts including the names
of children and the number of people who were trapped with him.
   ``Doctors think this is possible as a result of strong
psychological stress. We decided to ask him a direct question: is he
really telling the truth. Akopyan said, `Yes,' and in a rather
mixed-up way repeated his first version,'' Tass correspondents
Kirill Dibrova and Alexander Shchglenko wrote.
   They said doctors ``do not reject the theoretical possibility''
that Akopyan had spent a month trapped in the basement.
   It added that ``today Akopyan told doctors that if journalists do
not leave him in peace, he will throw himself out the window.'' It
said doctors ``consider this threat fully possible.''

<HEAD>Bush Inaugural: A Better View, $25 Million Housewarming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Bush, a man who has uprooted wife and
children 28 times in his career, moves this week into yet another
house, one with a better view. And a $25 million party will welcome
him to the neighborhood.
   It is the most glorified ritual of the Republic, this quadrennial
festival, and Washington is celebrating, as usual, as if Friday's
inauguration were for the first president, and not the 41st.
   Well, maybe not the first. George Washington, after all, took the
oath in New York City, and did so without pageantry. The founding
fathers wanted to avoid any semblance of European monarchy, and kept
the ceremony as spartan as Bush's, 200 years later, will be
elaborate.
   Even Bush, who intends to wear a regular business suit for his
oath-taking on the Capitol's West Portico on Friday, confessed he is
``not entirely'' comfortable with the costly, four-day panoply of
social events surrounding that simple act.
   But he added ``I have no apologies for the way we're doing it,''
because the country deserves a celebration every four years.
   The show officially begins Wednesday, with Bush and Vice
President-elect Dan Quayle leading the public in an outdoor
cavalcade at the Lincoln Memorial. The audience will be given
flashlights to beam a ``thousand points of light,'' the phrase Bush
often uses to symbolize America's private volunteers. A Navy fly-by,
an Army parachute demonstration, music by the Gatlin Brothers and
the Beach Boys, and a fireworks finale also are on the program.
   The opening spectacle is one of at least nine free events
sponsored by the inaugural committee, an unprecedented number, even
as other, invitation-only affairs boast hefty prices. Three
black-tie dinners Wednesday night, for example, cost $1,500 per
person. A box for eight at the entertainment gala at the capital's
Convention Center Thursday goes for $25,000. You can see the
two-hour show, featuring Frank Sinatra, Julio Iglesias, Randy Travis
and Loretta Lynn, live and for free on CBS.
   Overall, the estimated cost of more than a score of major,
official events, including 11 inaugural balls Friday night, is a
record $25 million, with most of that raised privately via ticket
prices and the sale of commemorative items ranging to $1,200 for a
bald eagle in Steuben glass. By contrast, Ronald Reagan's two
inaugurals cost $20 million in 1985 and $15.5 million in 1981; Jimmy
Carter's cost $3.5 million in 1977.
   The public pays a share. Congress appropriated $750,000 to cover
part of the cost of the Friday ceremony on the Capitol grounds, and
also to foot its own luncheon with the new president. And $2.5
million in tax money is earmarked for the Armed Forces Inaugural
Committee, which is organizing various military contributions,
including marching bands, chauffeurs for dignitaries, and security
and traffic control. About 8,500 members of the armed forces will be
involved.
   Given tolerable weather, an estimated 150,000 people are expected
to flock to the Capitol in winter's chill for Bush's oath-taking and
inaugural address Friday. Tickets, dispensed free of charge by
members of Congress, will be required for all but the most-distant
spots. Planners have their fingers crossed; Reagan's second
swearing-in, in 1985, had to be moved inside and his parade was
canceled when temperatures plummeted below 10 degrees.
   Already, with smaller events still being added on a daily basis,
Bush's inauguration schedule is nearly as long as the list of
arrivals at National Airport. More than 70 events, ranging from
state receptions to a prayer service at National Cathedral on
Sunday, have been coordinated with the inaugural committee, and
scores of other, independent shindigs are planned, including the
usual array of counter-inaugural parties for critics of the new
president.
   There are big parties, little parties. Parties expensive, parties
moderate. Parties hard-to-get-in, parties impossible-to-get-in. The
hottest ticket is one of cheapest, $50, for the ``Black Tie and
Boots Ball'' hosted by the Texas State Society on Saturday. It sold
out all 5,500 spots within 24 hours and has returned thousands of
checks with regrets. The bash, incidentally, will feature Bush's
favorite Tex-Mex food, two-step tunes by Jody Nix and the Texas
Cowboy Band, and offers a Ford pickup with a gun rack as the door
prize.
   The 11 official balls a night earlier are expected to draw 60,000
invited guests, including 12,000 youngsters at two casual-dress
youth balls, jostling for a brief glimpse of the new president. The
nine adult versions cost $175 per ticket.
   For their $1,500, guests at the candlelight dinners Wednesday
night will be served Maryland crab pate loaf made with clotted
cream, roast baby veal ``forced with oysters and sage,'' asparagus
spears, corn souffle and a salad made of Belgian Endive, spinach and
watercress. Desert will be an apple and cranberry brown betty with
cinnamon ice cream covered with bourbon custard sauce, followed by a
demitasse of coffee.
   All over town, chefs are adding an early Federal touch to their
menus _ the brown betty, for example _ in keeping with one of the
inaugural's themes, ``From George to George.'' Even more were
offering chili, gumbo, tacos and pork rinds, in keeping with the
tastes of a Connecticut Yankee turned Texan.
   The week's activities include a Salute to The First Lady, Barbara
Bush, at each of three halls in the Kennedy Center on Thursday,
where a $50 ticket buys a choice of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Charlton
Heston or Cheryl Ladd for entertainment. Several events are aimed at
teen-agers and children, including a forum with Quayle and Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos on Thursday and a history-and-entertainment
pageant at Constitution Hall on Saturday.
   Friday is the biggest day, of course, and Bush's inaugural speech
will be followed with the traditional parade west on Pennsylvania
Avenue to the White House. The 10,000 marchers will include 34
military units, high school and college bands from every state,
tootling calliopes, clopping Clydesdales, the California Raisins and
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The ``Yellow Rose of Texas,'' the
``Eyes of Texas,'' and ``Deep In The Heart Of Texas'' may be heard a
time or two.
   After dancing the night away, the President and Mrs. Bush will
open the doors of the White House to the public on Saturday from
8-11 a.m., personally greeting thousands of people likely to wait in
line for hours. Guests will be allowed to stroll the South Lawn, too.

   Blue is back. Brown is down. And the California
look, come Jan. 20, will be passe.
   The inauguration of George Bush brings much more than a change in
government. It's the launch of a whole new look _ a look that is
prompting sighs of relief among graying women larger than size 4 and
men's clothing retailers who never met a brown suit they liked.
   Barbara Bush is keeping her inaugural outfits a secret, at least
until the last minute.
   But a few things are certain. Her favorite color is blue _ so
farewell to scarlet, the color so identified with Nancy Reagan that
reporters wore it to press conferences in an effort to attract her
husband's attention.
   Farewell, too, to designer Adolfo, another favorite of Mrs.
Reagan. Mrs. Bush, an unabashed size 12, prefers Bill Blass and
Arnold Scassi, Diane Dickinson and Adele Simpson. She's having
several designers put together her inaugural wardrobe.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that she'll look spectacular from
head to toe, but it will be a different style (from Nancy Reagan),''
said Mrs. Bush's spokeswoman, Sondra Haley. ``She'll have her own
style.''
   When he takes his oath of office on the Capitol steps,
President-elect Bush will be wearing a business suit _ possibly a
dark Oxford gray number he purchased within the last two weeks from
Arthur A. Adler, a men's store a few blocks from the White House.
Size 42 long, alterations on the sleeves and cuffs.
   Vice President-elect Dan Quayle also bought a couple of suits
from Adler last week _ one navy blue, the other a navy stripe. ``If
I were to guess, I would say the solid navy for the swearing-in,''
said store manager David Sheftell.
   ``No browns, no tans. These gentlemen know what colors do the
most for them and that's why they're sticking with the blues and
grays,'' Sheftell added. Ronald Reagan's penchant for brown didn't
do much for Sheftell.
   ``Mr. Reagan never got away from the California look,'' Sheftell
said gingerly. ``Bush is a traditional dresser, which stems back
from his time at Yale. We used to call it Ivy League.'' He smiled,
anticipating a resurgence in sales.
   Bush and Reagan wore traditional tails to the swearing-in in
1981, but they shifted to business suits in 1985. Bush ``is more
comfortable in a business suit,'' said spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
``Also, all of the members of Congress are going to be dressed in
suits as well. He didn't want to feel overdressed.''
   Washington's tony boutiques and department stores are in an
inaugural merchandising frenzy, their bunting-draped windows filled
with crisp tuxedos, bright full-skirted gowns and sparkling
rhinestone evening bags.
   ``People are buying long dresses, very elaborate, a lot of full
skirts, bright colors as well as black. It's been pretty hectic,''
said Renee Rizik, part owner of Rizik's, a downtown specialty store
in the heart of the power shopping district.
   Any changes from 1985? ``There's more of a range this time,'' she
said, referring to purchase prices. Last time, they were mainly very
expensive.
   Gowns were on sale for half-price at the Elizabeth Arden salon
across the street from Rizik's. Black sequins, emerald taffeta, red
velvet, white satin. Full skirts, tight bodices, spaghetti straps,
no straps. Some of them $1,500 _ after reduction.
   ``The sales are in timing with the balls, which makes it easier
on everybody,'' said saleswoman Peggy O'Connor. ``They're buying
bright colors because it's a happy time _ reds and blues.''
   For those who don't have $1,500 to blow on a ball gown, Joanna
Doniger has opened a temporary branch of her New York establishment,
One Night Stand, at a suburban Holiday Inn. The room is lined with
gowns; she brought 250 to rent for one night only at prices ranging
from $175 to $350. Necklaces go for $20, earrings for $10.
   ``People are dressing up much more than they were 10 years ago,
but who wants to go out and spend a couple of thousand dollars for a
dress?'' Doniger asked airily between appointments. ``We probably
see about 20 people a day. We can always fit people in as long as we
know they are coming.''
   One Night Stand may be a godsend for society tyros, but the more
traditional couture customers are frequenting their usual haunts _
places like Neiman-Marcus. A week before the balls, the uptown
branch of the fancy department store had sold 100 gowns and was
anticipating an additional five or 10 sales to last-minute shoppers.
   ``We're selling a very full ball type of gown,'' said public
relations manager Juana Stockwell. ``A lot of people thought it (the
Bush inauguration) would be more understated, but we haven't really
seen a change.''
   Neiman-Marcus has developed a $1,200 pair of shoes called ``the
stars and stripes shoe,'' a white satin silk pump covered with pave
rhinestones in red, white and blue, configured in stars and stripes.
Stockwell said only one pair had been sold, by a branch in Texas.
   Another inaugural special, also going begging, was a $47,000
eagle brooch encrusted with gems. ``This would be perfect for
Barbara Bush,'' said Stockwell. ``It really would, because of the
eagle, and although it's all precious jewels, it's an understated
piece. She likes the understated type of jewelry and it's really
elegant.''
   Are you listening, Mr. President-elect?

   Even back when a loaf of bread cost a
couple of cents, it must have seemed like a bargain: Contribute
$100, and your sons, your grandsons, your great-grandsons, and so on
in perpetuity would get free tuition at Indiana University.
   Sixty-eight people took the school up on its offer back in 1856,
and a descendant of one of them is trying to get the school to make
good on the deal.
   Scott Raper is the first descendant of state Rep. Elias Abel, one
of the purchasers, to try to benefit from his
great-great-great-great-grandfather's investment.
   However, Indiana residents now pay about $1,100 a semester, not
$8 as in 1856, and the university is studying how it will handle the
family's claim.
   University counsel Cliff K. Travis says he will review the
request when he gets copies of wills and documents that establish a
line of succession for the scholarship.
   Raper, a 1988 graduate of Owen Valley High School in Spencer, is
majoring in business at Indiana, a state university that was founded
in 1820.
   His mother, Nancy Raper, said last week she has the documents
Travis says he needs, and threatened to sue the university if the
scholarship is not honored.
   Mrs. Raper said she has known about the scholarship since she was
a little girl, but considered the piece of paper as just a curiosity
until a year ago. Previous generations of Abel's descendants either
didn't go to school or included no sons. The scholarship specifies
male descendants because women were not admitted to the school back
when it was created.
   Mrs. Raper said when her mother died a year ago and her son was
making plans to attend Indiana, the significance of the scholarship
hit her. She consulted a lawyer, and decided to follow up on it.
   ``It's something that my great-great-great grandfather purchased
in the belief that his heirs would be taken care of,'' she said.
``He was a supporter of the university, and I'm sure $100 helped
tremendously at that time.''
   If the validity of the scholarship has to be decided in court,
Travis says, it would be the first time.
   He said similar requests have come up a few times over the
decades. But for at least 40 years they have been rejected for
in-state residents on the basis of a university ruling that
technically, nobody from Indiana pays tuition, only ``fees.''
Out-of-state residents are eligible for partial scholarships _ the
difference between in-state ``fees'' and whatever the total charged
to out-of-state residents is, the ruling stated.
   Whether that definition will be applied in Raper's case, in order
to disqualify him, is what university officials are trying to decide.
   But Mrs. Raper said her great-great-great grandfather would not
have purchased a perpetual scholarship if it were only intended to
pay out-of-state tuition.
   ``I just can't understand why he'd purchase something that would
be no good to him,'' she said.

   Burt Reynolds' film crew found the
people living at a West Palm Beach home agreeable to blowing up
their front lawn for an episode of the ``B.L. Stryker'' television
series.
   Everything was fine _ until the owner of the home found out.
   When Daniel O'Brien of Ardsley, N.Y., learned that Reynolds'
production company was crashing cars in front of his house and had
given his living room the look of a motel, he called demanding
answers.
   ``They have no permission to do this,'' said O'Brien's son,
Kieran, from New York. Neither watched the filming in person.
   Blue Period Inc. said the company did have permission _ from
O'Brien's tenants, Ricardo and Laura Gonzalez, who signed an
agreement allowing the filming. Mrs. Gonzalez refused to answer
questions Friday.
   Officials of Reynolds' company said they were under the
impression the Gonzalezes owned the three-bedroom house until
O'Brien telephoned Friday morning.
   ``If we thought there was a problem, we could have gone to
another location and then found another house to shoot,'' said Rita
Duffy, assistant locations coordinator for the series. ``Burt has
always tried to be as cooperative as possible.''

   Celebrity attorney Marvin Mitchelson, who put
``palimony'' in the lexicon of domestic breakups, has been ordered
to pay Sotheby's auction house interest on nearly $1 million worth
of jewelry for which he has not yet paid, as well as attorneys' fees.
   Mitchelson was ordered Friday to pay interest from April 9, 1987,
the day he took possession, rather than Oct. 21, 1988, the day he
claims the money was due.
   U.S. District Judge James Ideman on Friday also ordered
Mitchelson to pay Sotheby's $100,000 in attorneys' fees.
   The jewelry was once owned by the Duchess of Windsor. Mitchelson
bid on them at auction in Geneva in April 1987.
   Mitchelson has not paid for the gems because he does not have the
money, according to his attorney, Harold Rhoden, who said the ruling
means Mitchelson owes $200,000 in interest.
   ``Palimony'' was the legacy of Mitchelson's work for Michelle
Triola Marvin in suing her former live-in boyfriend, actor Lee
Marvin, in 1976.

   Mop-topped, seventh-grader Adam Guier will
spend the next two months playing the lead in a movie about the
childhood of basketball star ``Pistol'' Pete Maravich.
   The northwest Louisiana youth was one of five finalists screened
by Maravich more than a year ago.
   Maravich, the leading scorer in college basketball history and a
member of the NBA Hall of Fame, died in January 1988 from a heart
attack during a pickup basketball game in California.
   The 12-year-old will begin work on the film Feb. 5 in Baton
Rouge. ``Pistol'' is being filmed by independent filmmaker Peter
Andrews of the Louisiana Production Group.
   Guier has been practicing ball-handling drills for about four
years _ ever since his father put up a basketball goal in the
backyard. One of the tricks that young Guier and Maravich both
mastered at the age of 12 is dribbling with either hand while riding
a bicycle.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson has sued the owners of
an Inglewood video store, alleging they are selling unauthorized
copies of the ``common ground'' speech he made to the Democratic
Convention last summer.
   The federal copyright infringement case asks the court to
prohibit sales of the Jackson video at the Cable Via Satellite store
and to award the former Democratic presidential candidate
unspecified punitive damages.
   The lawsuit filed by attorney Donald L. Samuels names Charles
Cordell Conrad and Dezella Banks as defendants.
   Conrad, who was reached by telephone at the store, denied he is
selling the tapes, saying they may have been sold by Banks, who he
said was an independent contractor who was ``selling things on his
own.''
   He also denied the lawsuit's charge that he and Banks are the
same person.

<HEAD>Couple Awarded Total $9.7 Million in Car Battery Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who tried to help an elderly couple
jump-start their car has been awarded $6.5 million in punitive
damages for injuries he suffered when the battery exploded.
   The jury's action Friday against Johnson Controls Inc., the
manufacturer of Sears Die-Hard batteries, raised to $9.7 million the
total damages awarded to Gary Jones, 34, and his wife, Mona, of
Redding.
   On Thursday, the Superior Court jury found Johnson Controls Inc.
and the distributor, Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. Inc., liable for $3.2
million in general damages. The general damages covered Jones'
injuries, medical costs and lost wages.
   The jury's finding on punitive damages singled out Johnson
Controls because attorneys for the Joneses contended that the
company knew about the battery's defective design but did not warn
consumers.
   Attorneys for Johnson Controls said an appeal is planned.
   Jones, a former banquet chef, tried to help an elderly couple
jump-start their car in June 1986 across the street from the La
Jolla campus of the University of California at San Diego.
   Jones testified during the six-week trial that as soon as the
engine turned over, the Sears Die-Hard battery exploded.
   ``I was blown from the car and I screamed for someone to call an
ambulance,'' said Jones, who lost an eye and suffers seizures.
   An attorney for the couple, Harvey Levine, said he hoped Johnson
Controls would recall the batteries or at least warn customers of
the jump-start danger.
   The design of the battery was changed in 1985.

<HEAD>Farmer Offers Wheat To Soviets For Space Flight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Oklahoma farmer says he has offered the
Soviet Union $1 million worth of wheat in exchange for a seat on a
Soviet space flight.
   Even if the Soviets accept his offer, 73-year-old Elmer Graham
still has to convince his wife, Mary Ruth.
   ``She raises hell every time I get on one of these tears,''
Graham said in a telephone interview.
   The southern Oklahoma farmer and banker said he wrote Soviet
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin on Nov. 30 offering the deal. He hasn't had
a reply, but he thinks that is a good sign.
   ``If they were going to turn it down, they would have just
flat-footed done it,'' Graham said. ``I figure they're checking me
out, making sure I'm not with the CIA or something like that.'
   He said he did not apply to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration for a space flight.
   ``I'd a heap lot rather go up with the United States, but they
quit that after that accident,'' he said, referring to the
Challenger disaster that killed seven astronauts.
   Graham, who says he farms several thousand acres of land, also is
board chairman of two southern Oklahoma banks. He said he personally
doesn't have the $1 million worth of wheat, ``but I've got friends
who have offered to lend me what I need.''

<TEXT>
   Thirty-five years after a young Martin
Luther King Jr. stepped up to the pulpit at Dexter Avenue Baptist
Church, aging members of his congregation carry on the activist
spirit he fostered.
   The red-brick building situated a block from the Alabama Capitol
looks much as it did the day he arrived. The worn, dark pews are the
same ones members sat in to hear King's sermons. Only cushions have
been added.
   The Rev. Murray Branch, the current pastor, said physical
appearances are not the only things that remain unchanged at the
church, now known as the Dexter Avenue King Memorial Baptist Church
and recognized in 1974 as a national historic landmark.
   King, who would have turned 60 Sunday, came to Dexter Avenue in
the fall of 1954 at age 25. On Dec. 2, 1955, blacks went to his
church to organize the Montgomery bus boycott, often regarded as a
starting point for the civil rights movement.
   Branch said that kind of activist spirit _ which dates back to
the church's founding in 1877 _ still exists in the congregation.
The church is a meeting place for social activists, and its work
extends into Africa, where the congregation supports missionary work.
   King ``would be pleased to some extent because we have increased
substantially in our benevolent work,'' Branch said in an interview
last week. He said ``a constant stream'' of people comes to the
church in need of help.
   ``Hardly a week passes that we do not get appeals, and many are
white,'' said Branch, who taught at Morehouse College in Atlanta
while King was a student.
   But Zelia Evans, who remembers King's first sermons, said he
would not be satisfied. ``He would think we were not doing enough,''
she said.
   On Monday, the national holiday marking King's birthday, a noon
service featuring speakers and singing is expected to attract scores
of visitors. On Sunday, congregants will remember their former
pastor with a quieter service.
   Branch said Dexter Avenue Baptist had about 460 members in King's
day, but that number has dwindled to about 250.
   Robert Nesbitt, a member of the church committee looking for a
new pastor, had heard about King from a friend while in Atlanta.
King had planned to go to Chattanooga, Tenn., to preach, but Nesbitt
persuaded him to come to Dexter Avenue, Mrs. Evans said.
   ``He was young and energetic. In fact, one of the members said,
`Why did Mr. Nesbitt bring us that boy to preach here?' But we found
out he was much more than a boy,'' she said.
   Members knew they had a good preacher in King, ``but we didn't
know how special he was,'' Mrs. Evans said.
   King remained at Dexter Avenue through 1960, when the demands of
the civil rights movement required his full attention. Some of the
programs King instituted at Dexter Avenue Baptist still are in
place, such as his Month Clubs, in which members sharing birthdates
in the same month get together for service projects.
   Branch disagreed with assessments that King built Dexter Avenue
Baptist, or vice versa. King's personality dictated his destiny,
Branch said, adding, ``He was headed this direction growing up at
Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.''
   And Branch said the church exhibited a keen social conscience
long before King, as early as the late 1800s, when news accounts
indicate it provided assistance for disaster victims in Central
America.

   The last president to hold an open house was William Howard Taft,
80 years ago. But the most memorable occasion was in 1829, when
thousands of Tennessee frontiersmen and Indian fighters in muddy
boots followed one of their own, Andrew Jackson, right into the
White House. Many stood on the pastel upholsteries of fine damask
and satin just to get a better view; others shattered china and
glassware after too much refreshment.
   Most new presidents, of course, would prefer that their
inaugurals be remembered, not for the whirlwind of celebration, but
for their calls to the nation's conscience, those ringing words of
wisdom to set America on an ever brighter course. But there have
been more thuds, than rings, especially in this century.
   Still, the nation embraces with special fondness the words of
Franklin Delano Roosevelt to a Depression-stricken country in 1933:
``The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' And then there
were those of a Democrat from Massachusetts, who unlike Michael
Dukakis, managed to defeat an incumbent vice president for the White
House. ``Ask not ...'' said John Kennedy.
   Bush probably will have his moments. But first he may want,
simply, to take in the view. The departing tenant, Ronald Reagan,
put it this way, by way of defining the job Bush has had the last
eight years: ``The vice presidency ... is described by an old rule
of dog-sledding _ only the lead dog gets a change of scenery.''

<HEAD>Resolution Of Territorial Dispute Clears Way For Last Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State George P. Shultz will embark
on his last overseas trip Sunday, a visit to Vienna to wind up a
35-nation human rights conference and set the stage for East-West
arms control talks.
   While in the Austrian capital, Shultz also will hold a 32nd and
final meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Shultz plans to return to Washington on Tuesday after making a
speech to the conference. He will leave office three days later, to
be succeeded by James A. Baker III, assuming Senate confirmation,
and fly home to Palo Alto, Calif.
   The trip had been on hold until Greece and Turkey settled a
dispute over how much Turkish territory would be included in arms
control negotiations between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Warsaw Pact.
   In 6{ years, Shultz, 68, has flown more than 1 million miles on
diplomatic missions. On this one he will spend about 18 hours in the
air and about 32 hours on the ground.
   The Vienna conference has run for 27 months. Its windup first was
delayed until the Reagan administration was satisfied with the
reforms the Soviet Union had made in human rights. The release of
more than 600 political prisoners, reunification of more than 100
divided families and a nine-year high in Jewish emigration met the
U.S. test.
   As a result, Shultz recommended and President Reagan approved the
holding of another human rights review in Moscow in 1991 and the
closing down of the Vienna conference.
   Shultz and Shevardnadze, both instrumental in the improvement in
U.S.-Soviet relations, will discuss preparations for the arms
control talks and probably the scheduled Feb. 15 completion of a
Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   The United States was not directly involved in the dispute
between Greece and Turkey, but worked behind the scenes for a
resolution. Yuri Dubinin, the Soviet ambassador to Washington,
called on Shultz late Thursday to discuss the situation.

   Here is the text of President Reagan's radio
address Saturday:
   My fellow Americans, over the years I've greatly enjoyed this
opportunity to get together with you and report on the week's events
here in Washington. But next week, after witnessing the inauguration
of George Bush as president, Nancy and I will head back to the
ranch. And we go with full hearts, with best wishes for George and
Barbara, and with gratitude to all of you. It's been a privilege to
serve the people and the nation we've always loved and love so much
today.
   It's difficult, of course, to put all of the events of eight busy
tumultuous years in perspective. In fact, that's best left to the
impartial judgment of history. But as I look back over these
Saturday talks, I can't help but think about how often, at moments
of accomplishment and triumph as well as crisis and heartbreak, we
came together in this way. A president giving his accounting to
those under our system of government to whom he is accountable. We
shared a great deal together. For me, it's been a special
relationship. Believe me, Saturdays will never seem the same. I'll
miss you.
   But you know, somehow, messages of farewell, leave-taking, and
nostalgia, don't quite capture my mood today. Don't get me wrong,
we've had great years and done much together. The economy is
booming; long-festering social problems like drugs, crime, have
declined; and our educational standards are being dealt with; and
for the first time in the postwar era, the Soviet menace shows some
signs of relenting. This last development is, of course, so
heartening to those of us who've lived through all the brooding
terrors of the postwar era. We're prayerful and hopeful _ hopeful
that the next generation of Americans will not have to contend, as
we did, with the nightmares of nuclear terror and totalitarian
expansionism.
   You know, shortly after World War II and the struggle against
Nazi Germany, Winston Churchill looked with grave concern and
sadness at a world that evolved so quickly, as he put it, ``from
triumph and tragedy.'' But then, as he began to detect the vigor and
resolve of America against the Soviet menace, and for freedom in
Europe and everywhere in the world, a vigor and resolve shared
equally by an American president and an American Congress of
different political parties, he grew hopeful and grateful for this
unselfish, bipartisan unity.
   There's a story I want to tell you today about a meeting
Churchill had with a group of American journalists in 1952, at a
time when all the troubles of the Cold War, including the hardship
of morally and militarily rearming the West, were keenly felt. His
friend and physician, Lord Moran, recorded Churchill's appraisal of
American leadership.
   ``What other nation in history,'' Churchill asked, ``when it
became supremely powerful has had no thought of territorial
aggrandizement, no ambition but to use its resources for the good of
the world? I marvel at America's altruism, her sublime
disinterestedness.''
   ``All at once I realized,'' Lord Moran wrote, ``Winston was in
tears. His eyes were red. His voice faltered. He was deeply moved.''
   Well, generous words, honest emotion from a great world leader;
and now, more than a quarter century later, as the decade of the
'80s comes to a close, there is hope that the generosity and resolve
that Churchill saw in the American people is at last paying an
historic dividend. The possibility of a new time in human history,
when all the problems that so haunted the postwar world give way to
peace and expansion and freedom.
   So, you can see why, to me, the story of these last eight years
and this presidency goes far beyond any personal concerns. It is a
continuation, really, of a far larger story, a story of a people and
a cause. A cause that, from our earliest beginnings, has defined us
as a nation and given purpose to our national existence. The hope of
human freedom, the quest for it, the achievement of it, is the
American saga.
   And I've often recalled one group of early settlers making a
treacherous crossing of the Atlantic on a small ship, when their
leader, a minister, noted that perhaps their venture would fail and
they would become a byword, a footnote, to history. But perhaps,
too, with God's help, they might also found a new world, a city upon
a hill, a light unto the nations.
   Those words and that destiny beckon to us still, whether we seek
it or not, whether we like it or not, we Americans are keepers of
the miracle. We are asked to be guardians of a place to come to, a
place to start again, a place to live in the dignity God meant for
his children. May it ever be so.
   Thanks for listening, and God bless you.

   Here is the text of the Democratic response to
President Reagan's radio address Saturday, as given by Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.:
   Good afternoon. I'm Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut. As a newly
elected senator, I am especially honored to be asked by Sen. George
Mitchell to follow this final weekly radio address of President
Ronald Reagan.
   Over the last several years, we Democrats have used this time to
provide constructive alternatives to the policies of the president
and his party.
   But today, we join with all Americans in honoring and
appreciating his stewardship of the highest office in our land.
   Mr. President, we salute you. Your love of this country and your
fervent devotion to freedom inspired us all. You raised the spirit
of America, and upheld the values of faith, flag and family that we
hold so dear.
   I believe that is why, after eight years, Mr. President, you are
even more popular with the American people than on the day you were
sworn in. Some politicians might find that fact frustrating, but we
all should be grateful for it. For without the respect of the
people, the president would be powerless, and our country would be
left at risk.
   ``America is freedom,'' President Reagan said in his farewell
address this week. As a person whose grandparents came to this
country to escape persecution abroad and just last week was sworn in
as a United States senator, I know how real the American promise of
freedom and opportunity still is.
   But I also know that along with opportunity comes challenge, and
that is what confronts us now at the end of the Reagan era and the
beginning of the Bush administration, the challenge and opportunity
of our future.
   We are challenged to protect our nation's security while we
pursue the opportunity for peace with the Soviet Union.
   We are challenged to end the plague of drugs and crime, while we
endeavor to provide opportunity for our young people to become
educated, and trained to join our workforce.
   We are challenged to reduce the federal deficit while opening
opportunities for those afflicted with disease or burdened by
poverty.
   But perhaps our greatest new challenge in the years ahead will
come from the natural environment that delimits our world and
defines the quality of our lives.
   When the pilgrim John Winthrop envisioned the shining city upon
the hill, of which the president speaks so eloquently, he looked out
upon a continent untouched by smog, hazardous waste and acid rain.
In the centuries since that pristine age, we have conquered the
continent, but we have also made it dirty and unsafe.
   The industrial revolution has swept the world, but we haven't
swept up behind it. Now the decades of neglect have come back to
haunt us, and threaten to engulf our children's future, and endanger
their health and safety.
   If we do not meet this challenge, we may face disaster. Holes in
the ozone layer and acid in the rain will cause skin cancer and lung
disease.
   Gases in the air will warm the planet and lead to drought in our
heartland and flooding along our coast.
   Waste in our water will make our beaches forbidding places to
visit on a summer's day.
   But there is hope, and it lies, as President Reagan would say,
with ``we the people.'' The protection of the environment will be
high on the agenda of the new Congress and the new president not
because it makes political sense, but because the people know it
makes common sense.
   People like Rico and Annette Gattilia of North Haven, Conn., who
built a grass roots environmental movement from the living room of
their modest home. A movement that does battle with the large
chemical company that pollutes the air in their own backyard and
dirties the river where once they would fish and swim.
   Government can't do everything; it must have limits, as President
Reagan has said. But one of the things it can and must do is protect
the health and safety of our people. Elimination of pollution in our
water, on our land and in the air is a responsibility we in
government cannot shirk. The people will not allow us to.
   As President Reagan's time in Washington comes to an end and my
service in the Senate here just begins, I must say that I am
encouraged and inspired by his sense of patriotism and hope. It
moves and binds us all across generations and ideologies, because it
is born of shared pride in country, belief in God, and a sense of
duty to the people.
   So let us now set out to work on the unfinished business of
America with the spirit of purpose and confidence that is the legacy
of the Reagan years. It is, after all, the same spirit that built
this country and will if we protect it, continue to make us a truly
great nation.

   Standing stoically in line for heating
fuel, Sadrahmah Bikhar mused on the pullout of Soviet troops, saying
simply, ``It's good; I don't like them.''
   It's hard to find anyone who does on the streets of this bleak
capital ringed by snowy hills.
   In random interviews with The Associated Press, most people were
openly hostile toward the Soviets. But asked about the survival
prospects of President Najib's Marxist government, many glanced
uneasily at the interpreter and bystanders and make noncommittal
replies.
   Instead, they expressed hope _ but little belief _ that the
fighting will end when the Soviets leave.
   Their reluctance to answer certain questions is understandable.
In this divided land, official rhetoric remains upbeat, although it
contrasts sharply with reality.
   On Saturday, anti-government guerrillas, known as Mujahadeen,
attacked a 400-vehicle government supply and ammunition convoy four
miles from Kabul.
   Western reporters saw Afghan units dig in on both sides of the
Solang highway, a key northern route, and heard rocket fire before
government troops opened fire into the hills and the convoy raced
past.
   The same day, the state-run Kabul Times published new triumphant
exhortations from the Soviet-backed Marxist administration. In a
report on celebrations for the ninth anniversary of the founding of
the Ministry of State Security, it said Gen. Ghulam Farouq Yaqubi
welcomed Najib, declaring, ``We feel ourselves more powerful than
ever against the thievish attacks of the intransigent extremists.''
   On the streets, Bikhar's several-hour wait reflected the
increasing harassment of the convoys running three times a week on
the Solang, now the sole highway supplying the city.
   As the Soviets have moved out their forces to meet a U.N.
deadline for pulling out all their troops by Feb. 15, guerrillas
have approached the capital and stepped up convoy attacks.
   Bikhar said all he knew was that things were getting worse. Asked
what he thought would happen when all the Soviets were gone, he
shrugged and said through an interpreter, ``I don't know. I hope the
fighting will stop.''
   But there was no doubt in the mind of Eshaqza Anargul, a mechanic
with the state-owned Afghan Airline, Ariana.
   ``There will be fighting for another 10 years, maybe longer,'' he
said.
   ``Economically, it will get worse too,'' he added.
   Armed opposition to the government began soon after it invited
the Soviet troops in 1979 in the wake of a Soviet-backed coup. Since
then, the war has killed an estimated 1 million people, driven a
third of the 15 million Afghans to Pakistan and Iran, and scarred
millions more.
   Amputees are a common sight on the streets of Kabul. Tales abound
of family members _ troops, guerrillas, and civilians _ killed or
missing.
   Abdul Salom, a turbaned 60-year-old, said he fled his village of
Saraikhoga, 50 miles from Kabul, after it was damaged in bombing
attacks against rebels. He has squeezed into a mud house with
relatives in the Kharkhana district of Kabul.
   The area is a mixture of bleak , concrete six-story apartments
and slums of mud houses without heat, electricity or water. Salom
squats under a blanket in a friend's shop _ a cargo container turned
into a makeshift store selling soap, nails, and other items.
   He is one of about 1 million refugees who have doubled the prewar
population of the capital.
   ``We just want peace,'' he said. ``No Russians, no Mujahadeen, no
government, just peace.''

   Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn., delivering

   NATO and the Warsaw Pact agreed Saturday
after two years of negotiations to hold new talks on reducing
conventional weapons and troops across Europe.
   The agreement was the final element of an accord designed to
enhance freedom in the Soviet bloc and boost East-West contacts. It
was initialed after a last-minute compromise solved a dispute
between Greece and Turkey.
   Diplomats who have spent more than two years haggling over that
accord informally accepted it _ minus the mandate for the new arms
talks _ Friday. Negotiators at the 35-nation conference said they
would formally adopt the final statement Sunday.
   The conference, to review the 1975 Helsinki Accords on economic
cooperation and human rights, convened in November 1986 and involved
the Soviet Union, United States, Canada and all European nations
except Albania.
   The U.S. ambassador to the talks, Stephen J. Ledogar, said the
arms negotiations could start the week of March 6. They were dubbed
CAFE, or talks on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.
   Ledogar told reporters the mandate for the arms talks was signed
by NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiators after last-minute telephone
calls between Vienna and the Turkish capital, Ankara, resulted in a
compromise on a Greek-Turkish dispute that stymied diplomats for the
past week.
   Greece had objected to the exclusion of a triangle of Turkish
territory close to the Syrian border from the arms talks.
   The territory includes the eastern Mediterranean port of Mersin,
which Greece says is used to ship arms to northern Cyprus,
controlled by Turkey.
   Turkey had agreed with the Soviet Union to exclude the territory
and feared that reopening the issue might prompt Moscow to reiterate
earlier demands to include the nearby U.S. air base of Incirlinck in
the talks.
   Ledogar said the territory was not strategically important in
East-West terms.
   The text of the new mandate left open whether the zone for the
new talks would include or exclude Mersin.
   Ledogar indicated this was deliberately left ambiguous but said
the United States, the Soviet Union and other unidentified states
gave undisclosed bilateral assurances to Turkey over the zone.
   The new talks will aim to reduce troops, tanks, heavy artillery
and other weapons across the continent, from the Atlantic to the
Ural mountains deep inside the Soviet Union.
   Negotiations on setting up the talks, which do not include naval
forces, chemical or nuclear weapons, started in February 1987.
   Both the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact have said they are eager to begin the negotiations,
which will replace the Mutual and Balanced Force Reduction talks
going on in Vienna since 1973.
   Those talks aimed only to reduce conventional troops and weapons
in central Europe.
   Negotiators from both blocs say they are hopeful the new talks
will progress much faster, although they are complicated by the
difficulties of defining weaponry involved and by verification.
   The mandate for the new talks now goes into the Helsinki final
document, which contains the most detailed human rights agreements
ever reached between East and West.
   Western diplomats hailed the accord but said the East bloc
frequently violated commitments it made on human rights in the 1975
Helsinki Final Act.
   The new accord foresees greater freedom for religious believers
in the East bloc, much more precise regulations on emigration and
travel from the East, an end to abuse of psychiatry and to the
jamming of Western radio stations, and increased East-West tourism
and business deals.
   It also for the first time creates a mechanism to raise human
rights issues at any time on a bilateral level with any other
Helsinki signatory.
   One of the most disputed issues at the Helsinki conference was a
1991 human rights conference in Moscow. The United States and
Britain announced last week they would go, but only on condition
that Soviet reforms continue and are institutionalized by then.
   Canada held out on Moscow until the last minute, seeking exit
visas for a Jewish couple in Leningrad refused emigration for 10
years on grounds of national security.
   Canadian Ambassador William Bauer said Saturday the Soviets had
promised to review the case.
   Delegates had said they would formally adopt the accord on
Saturday, but on Saturday that was pushed back to Sunday.
   A Western diplomat said the delay was due to East German
objections to a word in the German translation of a provision that
minimum currency exchange requirements could be abolished in the
future. The objection was resolved, he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   East Germany earns millions of West German marks each year from
visitors required to change certain amounts of hard currency and
only last week agreed to consider abolishing them in future.

   A carpet with 6 million hand-woven knots,
believed to be a record number in each square inch, has been
completed in the Iranian city of Tabriz, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Saturday.
   The carpet, measuring 1 yard by 1{ yards, was made with 800
colors and took two years to complete, said IRNA, monitored in
Nicosia.
   It will displayed on the 10th anniversary of the Islamic
revolution next month.
   The carpet was woven by Tabriz's three Nezami-Doust brothers, who
based their design on a miniature painting of the fifth day of
creation _ the day God created birds, fish and sea monsters,
according to the Bible.
   The brothers now are working on an even finer carpet in which
they will put jewelry, IRNA said.

   The comments on the flight
recorder of a South African Airways plane that crashed in 1987 have
not produced the information investigators sought, the government
said Saturday.
   The Boeing 747 was traveling from Taipei, Taiwan, to Johannesburg
when it crashed into the Indian Ocean on Nov. 28, 1987, just prior
to a scheduled stop on the island nation of Mauritius. All 159
people on board were killed.
   South Africa has not given an explanation for the crash and has
refused to release the tape recordings of conversations between the
cabin crew and the control tower. It also has not said what
information it was hoping to get from the recording.
   The government launched a $6 million salvage operation that found
the recorder Jan. 6 off the coast of Mauritius, 2.5 miles underwater.
   The recorder was sent to the U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board in Washington where investigators listened to the tape last
week.
   The tape was audible but has not provided the information
investigators were seeking, the South African Department of
Transport said Saturday. It said it will continue to search for
unspecified pieces of the wreckage.

<TEXT>
   Two U.S. Air Force helicopters hoisted 32
people from the deck of a damaged Cypriot freighter Saturday during
a dramatic and dangerous rescue in the stormy North Atlantic.
   The helicopters then flew the West German captain and his wife,
the West German engineer, and the 29-member Filipino crew to Ireland.
   The West German-owned ship, the 42,000-ton Yarrowanga, was bound
from Norway to the St. Lawrence Seaway in Canada to take on iron ore
when it was caught in a gale Friday that put two large gashes in the
hull.
   The ship's boiler failed Friday, but the crew restarted it and
the ship was moving under its own power toward Ireland when the
rescuers arrived.
   The Yarrowanga was listing in 30-foot seas and 50-mph winds when
one of the helicopters first tried unsuccessfully to land on the
deck, rescue organizers said.
   The long-range HH 53C helicopters, based in Woodbridge-Bentwaters
in eastern England, had flown to Shannon International Airport on
Friday night and took off early Saturday for the flight of more than
200 miles to the vessel.
   They were refueled en route by two long-range HC-130 Hercules
tanker aircraft and reached the Yarrowanga in the early afternoon.
   In little more than an hour, the first helicopter lifted up 15
people with a winch and the second aircraft hauled up 17 more.
   The helicopters then headed back to Shannon, where the Irish
Marine Rescue Coordinating Center had been monitoring their progress.
   ``This was a textbook rescue operation,'' said Maj. Ken Stafford,
leader of the U.S. rescue squad. ``Everything went according to
plan. All taken off the stricken ship are in good health, and none
of them will need to be hospitalized.''
   As the skipper, identified only as Capt. Pietersen, and his wife
stepped out of the rescue helicopter, he shook hands with Irish
Marine Minister Brendan Daly and told him, ``We are all very happy
everything went well. It is great to be back on land.''
   The rest of the crew was driven to hotels after they were given
strict orders not to speak publicly until all reports are made, said
an airport official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   U.S. Air Force Capt. David Freeman said, ``It is the most
dangerous mission I've ever been on. But everything went well.''
   Royal Air Force Nimrod reconnaissance planes, designed for long
searches at sea, circled the ship Friday night.
   The Coast Guard Rescue Center at Falmouth, England, said a Dutch
tug, the Typhoon, was expected to reach the Yarrowanga on Sunday and
attempt to salvage it.
   Its Irish agent, shipping broker John Dundon, said the ship's
owners had sent instructions through him that the crew should
abandon ship, even if salvage rights were to be claimed by another
party.

   The sister of a man who claimed he and five
companions survived 35 days in the rubble of the Armenian earthquake
says the story was made up so her brother could get into a good
hospital, Soviet media reported Saturday.
   The Tass news agency said reporters had tracked down Aikaz
Akopyan's sister, Julietta, who Akopyan said witnessed his rescue
Jan. 11 from the ruins of his nine-story apartment building in the
city of Leninakan.
   Neither officials nor local journalists had been able to find his
sister or the five other people reportedly rescued with Akopyan.
They could find no witnesses to the reported rescue.
   ``At first the sister denied her kinship with Akopyan but later
on acknowledged that it was she who had brought Aikaz to the Yerevan
hospital and that he really was her brother,'' Tass said.
   ``According to her words, it appears that on Jan. 6 Aikaz
requested her to drive him to a good Yerevan hospital and it was on
the way to Yerevan that a story of rescue after 35 days was
ostensibly invented,'' Tass said.
   The government newspaper Izvestia said Akopyan's sister made up
the rescue story ``because she wanted to put her brother in a good
hospital.'' It based its report on an interview with an unidentified
Leninakan resident, who it said was present when Tass spoke to the
woman.
   Tass quoted Lt. Col. V. Kozlov of the Armenian civil defense
medical service as saying that according to data he had available,
Akopyan was rescued five days after the Dec. 7 earthquake, and that
on Jan. 6 he had sought drugs from Leninakan hospital for an
allergy. But he added that there are many people with the last name
Akopyan in Leninakan.
   However, the news agency said Akopyan, now in a hospital in
Yerevan, was sticking to his story and that doctors could not rule
out the possibility it was true. It said reporters still had been
unable to clarify all details of the case and that Akopyan had
threatened to jump out of the window in his hospital room if
reporters didn't leave him alone.
   Doctors ``regard the threat as quite realisitic,'' Tass said.
   Tass reported Thursday the rescue from the ruins of the quake
that killed about 25,000 people. That night, the 50-year-old
electrician was shown in his hospital bed on Soviet television.
   But the news agency cast doubt on the story the following day,
saying that no witnesses had been found. ``Everyone wanted to
believe in the Leninakan miracle,'' it said.
   Akopyan said he and the five others had gone to the basement of
the apartment building to haul out two large kegs when the
earthquake struck. They were stuck unhurt in a food cellar and
survived on canned vegetables, smoked ham, stewed fruit and pickles,
he said.
   He said he sang songs and told stories to the other five to keep
their spirits up.
   Akopyan was reported to be suffering from pneumonia as a result
of the confinement when he was admitted to the hospital.
   But Tass said Saturday that Gurgen Badanyan, whom it identified
as the leading Soviet internal medicine specialist, believed Akopyan
had been suffering chronic lung and heart deficiencies for least
several years.
   A psychiatric examination indicated Akopyan is not mentally ill,
Tass said. Doctors observed that he mixed up some facts, including
the names of children and the number of people who he said were
trapped with him.
   ``Doctors think this is possible as a result of heavy
psychological stress. We decided to ask straight whether he was
telling the truth. Akopyan said `yes' and in a rather confused way
repeated his first version,'' Tass correspondents Kirill Dibrova and
Alexander Shchglenko wrote.
   ``Medical specialists do not deny the theoretical possibility
that Aikaz Akopyan did spend about a month in a basement under the
rubble,'' Tass said.

<TEXT>
   Virginia's joint celebration Monday of the
birthdays of two Confederate generals and a black civil rights
leader on Lee-Jackson-King Day is ``the perfect combination of
diversity,'' says the man responsible for the merger.
   Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder, who as a state senator five years ago
pushed through the bill making Martin Luther King Jr. Day a Virginia
holiday, says he doesn't find it ironic that King shares the holiday
with Virginia natives Robert E. Lee and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson.
   ``I find no irony in it at all,'' Wilder, a grandson of slaves
and the first black elected to statewide office in the South since
Reconstruction, said Friday. ``It shows we are prepared to recognize
good men. Men of principle have differed on principle and I think
all three were men of principle.''
   James Farmer, a civil rights leader who worked with King, said
Saturday that King deserves a day all his own because ``Martin
Luther King stood alone as a giant.''
   But he said King would have been amused at being linked with
heroes of the Confederacy.
   ``Dr. King was very tolerant of things like that,'' Farmer said.
``If he is looking down from heaven now I can hear him laughing.''
   The bill passed the state legislature in 1984 after seven years
of effort by Wilder and often acrimonious debate in public hearings.
   Opponents objected to honoring a non-Virginian with a holiday
when favorite sons such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry did
not have their own days. Celebrating King's birthday on the third
Monday in January, already designated as Lee-Jackson Day, also drew
protest.
   King's birthday is Jan. 15, 1929. Lee was born Jan. 19, 1807 and
Jackson was born Jan. 21, 1824.
   ``The memory of Lee and Jackson is sacred to the hearts of all
true Virginians. To replace our heroes with Martin Luther King or
any other non-Virginian is to betray the greatness of our heritage
as a commonwealth,'' Forest Tucker, a member of the Sons of
Confederate Veterans, said in 1984.
   But Wilder persisted. ``I have never taken to the floor of the
Senate to say one word against Stonewall Jackson,'' he told his
fellow legislators five years ago. ``I have never failed to stand in
honor of Robert E. Lee. But that cause which is sacred to many
Virginians is not sacred to all Virginians.''
   Wilder, who is expected to announce his candidacy for governor
this month, now minimizes the controversy over the bill, pointing
instead to ceremonies around the state honoring King. In Richmond,
for example, a week of activities is being devoted in memory of the
slain civil rights leader, including forums, worship services and a
touring stage show performing works by black writers.
   Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a state holiday in all states
except Arizona, Idaho, Montana, New Hampshire, South Dakota and
Wyoming. Mississippians honor both Lee's and King's birthdays on the
same day.
   Charles Sadler, a spokesman for the Martin Luther King Federal
Holiday Commission in Washington, D.C., said his group doesn't mind
how King's birthday is celebrated, as long as it is. A joint holiday
is ``better than nothing,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An animal rights activist whose dog mauled a
young antelope had to be restrained by a game warden while a state
biologist tried to kill the wounded animal by hitting it over the
head with heavy pliers.
   Game Warden Lin Robinson said she stopped Carol Gauden from
interfering with Wyoming Game and Fish Department biologist Rich
Guenzel's attempts to kill the fawn.
   ``I was giving the fencing pliers to Rich to go ahead and
dispatch it while I was starting to walk way with her. She kind of
shoved me and grabbed me and we ended up on the ground and I sat on
her,'' Robinson said.
   Gauden, of Casper, had been walking with her dog in snow-covered
Crossroads Park Thursday when the dog attacked the antelope. She
called the Game and Fish Department for assistance.
   When Robinson and Guenzel arrived they told her the animal was
near death and would have to be killed, Gauden said.
   She offered to pay for the animal's care and let it graze on her
20 acres of land while it recovered. But the officers said the
antelope wouldn't survive well in care, Gauden said.
   Guenzel tried to kill the antelope with the pliers. The animal
didn't die after the first few blows so Robinson slit its throat.
   ``It's the first animal I've seen destroyed that way that didn't
immediately die,'' Robinson said.
   The antelope was badly injured, showing signs of heavy internal
bleeding, and had no chance of survival, she said. It had bite marks
from the ears to the shoulder blades, punctured intestinal walls and
a hide-torn rump.

   The motel where Martin Luther King Jr. was
slain has been a focal point for past celebrations, but will not be
part of the city's major tributes to the civil rights leader Monday.
   The Lorraine Motel, where King was killed by an assassin's bullet
in 1968, is to become the centerpiece of an $8.8 million civil
rights museum. The crumbling motel has been surrounded for most of
the past year by a chain-link fence.
   King was born Jan. 15, 1929, and the national holiday honoring
him is Monday. Promoters of the Lorraine museum had planned to stage
a groundbreaking ceremony for the project on the holiday, but it has
been delayed until Jan. 27.
   ``The state needed more time to line up the worker crews that are
to begin work that day,'' said D'Army Bailey, president of a
non-profit foundation that took up donations to buy The Lorraine at
a foreclosure auction in 1982.
   As the Lorraine museum project prepares to go forward, another
King institution is undergoing a transition.
   Coretta Scott King, the civil rights leader's widow, will step
down as president of The King Center on April 4, to be replaced by
her son, Dexter Scott King, directors of the Atlanta-based memorial
and policy center announced Saturday.
   Mrs. King will stay on as chief executive officer and
spokesperson for the center, which is devoted to spreading the
activist's non-violent policies worldwide.
   In Memphis, speeches and memorial services are planned at various
locations, including Clayborn Temple, where King helped organize a
sanitation workers' strike.
   He was killed while in town to help lead that protest. In past
years members of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees have gathered at The Lorraine to lay a wreath in
King's honor.
   ``They've got so much stuff going on down here now, I don't think
we need to go down (to the Lorraine). In fact, we can't even get on
the premises,'' said the Rev. James Smith, president of the
federation's Local 1733.
   The museum project, with funding from the city, county and state,
should be finished in 1991, Bailey said.
   The Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation plans to turn over
title to the motel to the state so it can maintain and run the
museum. However, Muhammad Ziad, leader of an organization called The
Poor People's Campaign, filed a lawsuit last week to keep the state
from taking over the building.
   He said in the Chancery Court lawsuit that people who gave money
to save the motel should be polled to see what they think about the
project.
   While the major King day events will be held elsewhere, a Memphis
group called the Commission On Religion and Racism has scheduled a
march to the motel.
   The march is dedicated to Jacqueline Smith, who has camped out on
a sidewalk beside the Lorraine since being evicted from the motel in
March to make way for the museum project.
   Miss Smith, a former Lorraine employee, contends the project is
part of an effort to gentrify the neighborhood, which is dominated
by warehouses and rundown rental property. She also has said the
memorial would focus on the violence of King's death rather than the
peacefulness of his message.

   The Salvation Army violated a woman's
constitutional right to freedom of religion when it fired her
because she practices witchcraft, a federal judge ruled.
   U.S. District Judge Dan M. Russell of Biloxi ruled last week that
the Salvation Army cannot discriminate against witches because it
receives federal funds for some programs.
   Jamie Kellam Dodge, a former victim's assistance coordinator at
the Pascagoula-based Salvation Army Domestic Violence Shelter, filed
a $1.25 million lawsuit against the Salvation Army. She sought
reinstatement and compensation for embarrassment, humiliation, pain
and suffering. A ruling on compensation will be made later, court
officials said.
   Dodge, 28, was fired in August 1987 after she admitted using the
agency copy machine to copy Satanic-Wiccan rituals, according to
court records.
   ``If you could see it, you would agree it was horrible. It talked
about sexual things, around the fire, lots of things that are
contrary to Salvation Army policies,'' Raymond Brown, an attorney
for the Salvation Army, said Saturday.
   The Salvation Army has not decided whether it will appeal the
decision, he said.
   Dodge's attorney, David Frazier of Pascagoula, called Russell's
decision ``courageous.''
   ``He bit the bullet and did what a federal judge is supposed to
do, to cite tough decisions in an effort to follow the law,''
Frazier said.

<HEAD>Police Guard Against Rally; Professor Warns Against Suicide Protests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police guarded Wenceslas Square on
Saturday to block a memorial service and activists threatened to
copy the suicide of Jan Palach, who burned himself to death in 1969
to protest the Soviet-led invasion.
   Opposition groups vowed to go ahead with a memorial rally Sunday
marking the 20th anniversary of Palach's suicide in the square,
despite a ban by Communist Party authorities.
   At least three anonymous letters were received in Prague during
the past week from an unknown ``Committee for Collective Suicide,''
threatening to emulate Palach's act 20 years ago.
   In an extremely unusual move by authorities, the party daily Rude
Pravo published a front-page letter from a professor who taught
Palach and later signed the Charter 77 human rights document. He
warned against further self-immolation attempts.
   Palach set himself alight in Prague's Wenceslas Square on Jan.
16, 1969, to protest the presence of Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia
after they invaded to crush the 1968 Prague Spring reforms.
   Milan Machovec, a philosophy professor who taught Palach at
Prague's Charles University, appealed in his letter to anyone
considering a repeat of Palach's act.
   ``I consider it my duty to reiterate ... that dying Jan Palach
himself urged young people not to follow him,'' the letter said.
   It was unprecedented for the Communist daily to print a letter
from a Charter 77 signatory. Machovec is also a member of the
recently formed Helsinki Committee and of the Masaryk Society, but
his dissident affiliations were not mentioned in Rude Pravo.
   Machovec quoted Tomas G. Masaryk, founder of the Czechoslovak
state in 1918, as saying suicide ``and similar extreme acts are
rather cheap and that real bravery is patient work and life.''
   Zdenek Dienstbier, the head of an official human rights commitee
founded last month, also received one of the self-immolation
threats. The commitee warned that a demonstrative suicide ``is a
very inhuman and immoral act'' and called for dialogue with the
unknown authors of the letter.
   Communist authorities in Prague banned the rally last week. The
independent groups said they would hold the protest anyway.
   Police began guarding the square early Saturday morning. Similar
tight security was in force August and October, when thousands of
people took part in banned rallies later broken up by police.
   A comment by the Soviet news agency Tass carried by several
official newspapers Saturday charged that Palach's death was not his
own choice.
   ``The adventurers who have deceitfully made him commit suicide
counted only on explosion of passions and emotions inside the
country,'' it said.
   ``It seems that the present handful of organizers of
anti-Socialist actions in Czechoslovakia tries to reach similar
objectives at any cost.''
   Earlier this week, police confiscated a death mask sculpted by
Olbram Zoubek, who made a tombstone for Palach's grave 20 years ago,
activists in Prague said.
   Activists have said Sunday afternoon's meeting was planned as a
brief commemorative act, with leading dissidents laying flowers and
lighting candles at the King Wenceslas statue where Palach set
himself on fire.
   Charter 77, one of five groups which called Sunday's rally, also
plans a vigil at Palach's grave on Jan. 21 in the village of
Vsetaty, about 18 miles north of Prague.
   His body was exhumed from the Prague cemetery and reburied at
Vsetaty in 1973. His Prague grave had often been heaped with flowers
and burning candles until the body was removed.

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has won
his first battle in a war with the bosses of the Oil Workers Union,
the most powerful but reportedly the most corrupt union in Mexico.
   In a bold move Tuesday, Salinas had union leader Joaquin
Hernandez Galicia and 50 of his associates arrested on charges
ranging from illegal possession of guns to tax evasion and homicide.
Hernandez Galicia faces a maximum sentence of 40 years.
   More arrests are expected soon, a source in the attorney
general's office told The Associated Press. He said Salinas planned
to ``clean up the situation.''
   ``We do not want to make it look like a witch hunt,'' a
government source said on condition of anonymity, ``but this is not
the end.''
   A likely additional charge is ``unexplained wealth.'' The
government has ordered banks to freeze accounts of the top leaders.
   It was the new president's first confrontation with the powerful
Mexican unions, and he picked a foe past presidents, fearful of his
power, had left alone.
   Critics in and outside the government claim union chiefs led by
La Quina _the diminutive by which Hernandez Galicia is known _
amassed fortunes, controlled lives and sold jobs in a paternalistic
system that built loyalities and gave bosses political leverage in
the governing Revolutionary Institutional Party.
   To appease the union, the party gives it an unofficial power
quota by nominating as legislators union members who then are almost
assured of victory. Despite losses in July 6 elections, the union
has one senator and seven representatives. Hernandez Galicia also
had his men as chiefs of police, judges and city councilors in oil
regions.
   Officials say Hernandez Galicia is a volatile leader who
blackmailed government administrations through his union power and
control over the state oil monopoly, Pemex, which at one time was
forced to grant the union 40 percent of its contract work. Much of
the work was done by companies set up by the union boss and his
associates.
   He frequently has been called repressive and authoritarian and is
accused of fraud, nepotism, even murder. Unexplained deaths and
beatings of those opposed to La Quina publicly have been blamed on
him and his men, though none of them ever has been charged in the
incidents.
   Hernandez Galicia always dismisses such allegations as attempts
by jealous foes trying to turn the president against him and the
union.
   Two bodyguards arrested with him last week have signed statements
saying they killed another labor leader on Hernandez Galicia's
orders, according to the attorney general's office.
   On Jan. 3, Hernandez Galicia threatened to call a general strike
if the government ``yielded as much as one millimeter of the oil
industry to private business.''
   The statement did not endear him to a president who has said the
state will retain control of the oil industry but seek private
domestic investment in related secondary industries.
   Hernandez Galicia opposed the nomination of Salinas, the man
responsible for eliminating many union privileges when he was budget
and planning secretary.
   The 66-year-old union chief, a welder who took over the union in
1964 and saw his power expand as the oil industry became Mexico's
top source of foreign income, was a revered figure who dispensed
favors to the rank and file, had children named after him and was
generous to schools and churches.
   But he also traveled with a personal escort of 35 armed men, said
a federal investigator.
   ``He was ruthless,'' said Maximo Hernandez, leader of a small
group in the union that opposes Hernandez Galicia. ``He would crush
opposition, post armed men at union meetings and hold three-minute
sessions to ram through what he wanted.''
   His arrest Tuesday caused a one-day walkout by union members at
most oil installations, but soon other labor unions offered their
support to Salinas.
   Some leftist parties accused the government of repression and
joined a few thousand oil workers in a march Thursday. Press
reaction favors the president, as does private business.
   ``We must remember the oil leaders' arrogance, how they have
challenged presidents with insolence ... We must remember their
excessive salaries, their avarice, how the union thought itself the
owner of Mexico's petroleum,'' wrote columnist Fernando Benitez in
La Jornada, a newspaper that often criticizes the government.
   ``He was a monster created by the governmment and the government
in the end cut off his head,'' said Hernandez. ``But the body is
still twitching.''

Talk</HEAD>

   Ronald Reagan delivered his 331st, and last,
radio address as president on Saturday, telling his listeners he was
grateful to have played a part in ``the story of a people and a
cause ... the American saga.''
   ``Believe me, Saturdays will never seem the same. I'll miss
you,'' the president said as he read his five-minute address from
the Oval Office.
   ``Over the years I've greatly enjoyed this opportunity to get
together with you, and report on the week's events here in
Washington,'' said the one-time radio sportscaster and Hollywood
actor.
   He started the Saturday series on April 3, 1982.
   Reagan noted that he and his wife Nancy planned to return home to
California after the inauguration of President-elect Bush on Friday.
   ``We go with full hearts, with best wishes for George and Barbara
and with gratitude to all of you. It's been a privilege to serve the
people and the nation we've always loved, and loved so much today,''
Reagan said. ``We shared a great deal together. For me, it's been a
special relationship.''
   Several hours after delivering his address, Reagan and his wife
Nancy departed for an overnight stay at the presidential retreat in
Camp David. In a first, the president and his wife traveled aboard a
new, $14 million Sikorski helicopter that has been designed for
presidential use. The sleek new craft is to be used for shorter
distances and on international trips because it is small enough to
be transported overseas in cargo aircraft.
   In his radio address, the president said he wasn't leaving with a
downcast spirit, asserting that the economy was booming, the
nation's social problems were being dealt with and ``the Soviet
menace shows some sign of relenting.''
   Reagan said his eight-year presidency was only part of ``a far
larger story, the story of a people and a cause ... the hope of
human freedom, the quest for it, the achievement of it, is the
American saga.''
   ``Whether we seek it or not, whether we like it or not, we
Americans are keepers of the miracle. We are asked to be guardians
of a place to come to, a place to start again, a place to live in
the dignity God meant for his children. May it ever be so,'' Regan
said.
   The president began his script with the traditional greeting,
``My fellow Americans,'' and ended it as he always has: ``Thanks for
listening. And God bless you.''
   Reagan's first job was as a sports broadcaster in Davenport,
Iowa, and radio gave him the exposure that helped him launch a
career in Hollywood.
   As an actor-turned-politician, Reagan honed his radio style for
use as a political tool during his days as the governor of
California.
   Over the years, it has been difficult to calculate how many
people hear the president's live, noontime address, since many of
the radio networks that have carried it only ``feed'' it to their
subscribers, who either replay it at their leisure or do not air it
at all.
   The only time the president was assured his voice would be
carried came during the 1984 campaign, when his campaign purchased
the air time.
   The president personally chose themes for his addresses.
   Occasionally, he dominated the news, as on the Saturday he used
the folksy-style addresses to announce the reappointment of Federal
Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, or the time he announced suspension
of a preferential trading status for Poland in the wake of the
communist government's suppression of the Solidarity labor union.
   Reagan's most infamous remarks came outside the formal radio
address, when he announced prior to one speech from his ranch in
California that he had ``just signed legislation that will outlaw
Russia forever. The bombing begins in five minutes.''
   The president has a habit of joking with his aides prior to the
talk, and the remarks were made during a voice check when the
microphone was turned on but he was not yet on the air. The remarks
were heard by the radio ``pool'' that was transmitting it to the
other networks.

<HEAD>Navy Reduces Persian Gulf Force Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. naval force in the Persian Gulf is
being trimmed again, leaving the fleet with six surface fighting
ships, the lowest number since the mid-1987 buildup that began as
the Iraq-Iran war escalated.
   As the missile cruiser USS Josephus Daniels and three missile
frigates departed the Gulf in recent days, three newly arriving
vessels entered the waterway to begin their three-month duty tours.
   The three-for-four swap effectively reduced the Gulf-based fleet
from 15 to 14 ships and pared the number of surface combatants _
cruisers, destroyers and frigates _ from seven to six.
   The total of 14 is the lowest number of American warships in the
Gulf since July 1987. It also includes six minesweepers, an
amphibious landing ship that serves as their ``mother ship'' and the
USS La Salle, flagship of the Joint Task Force Middle East.
   Another ten ships, a battle group built around the
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, remains on station in
the Arabian Sea. It is to be replaced by another carrier group,
headed by the USS Constellation, at the end of the month.
   The force inside the Gulf is slowly being reduced in strength
following the Iraq-Iran cease-fire that went into effect last
August. But U.S. military sources say a carrier group will be
operating in the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea for the foreseeable
future.
   The Defense Department said in a statement Friday that the
Josephus Daniels was being withdrawn because it was ``no longer
required to meet the threat to our forces and shipping in the
region.''
   In fact, the departure of the Daniels did not reflect a sudden
decision to reduce the force. The 8,200-ton cruiser, based at
Norfolk, Va., was scheduled to leave the Gulf on Jan. 8, along with
three other East Coast-based ships, the frigates Aubrey Fitch, Doyle
and Taylor.
   As those four ships sailed out of the Gulf in recent days, their
patrol responsibilities were taken over by the destroyer O'Bannon
and the frigates Hawes and De Wert, all based at Charleston, S.C.
   The frigate Klakring, originally slated for deployment along with
those three, had its orders cancelled in December. Officials said at
the time that the resulting force reduction of one ship was seen as
a ``prudent move ... considering the situation'' since the
cease-fire.
   With the arrival of the newcomers, the mix in the Gulf includes
the Hawes, the De Wert and another missile frigate, the Reid, as
well as the O'Bannon and another destroyer, the Harry W. Hill, plus
the missile cruiser England.
   The United States earlier scaled back its operations in the Gulf
from direct escorting of U.S.-flagged tankers to a system of
``monitoring'' their movements from a distance.
   It also has curtailed air patrols and, according to the Pentagon
on Friday, recently withdrew one of the four AWACs, or airborne
surveillance aircraft, based in Saudi Arabia during the last year of
the Iraq-Iran war.
   There have been no armed incidents in the Gulf since the United
Nations-brokered truce went into effect Aug. 20, and other foreign
navies have been pulling out their forces.
   Britain disclosed earlier in the week that it planned to withdraw
its last three minesweepers by March, leaving it with a three-ship
patrol unit. Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing
entirely, and the French have cut their regional force to reflect
the reduced tensions in the waterway since the 8-year war ended.
   Although the cease-fire has worked, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank
C. Carlucci said during a visit to the Gulf on Dec. 5 that there was
``no plan for major changes in our force structure'' as long as
Baghdad and Tehran failed to make any progress toward a negotiated
peace.
   U.S. officials have made it clear that the United States would
continue to maintain a permanent force in the Gulf, at least at the
level of four to six warships that were assigned there before the
1987 buildup.
   The continued presence of a Soviet fleet, some seven to ten
warships, is seen as an important factor affecting the rate at which
the United States will reduce its Gulf force, U.S. military sources
say.
   In any case, those sources say, any cutbacks would not include
the six minesweepers sent to the Gulf in late 1987 to deal with a
growing threat of mines planted by Iran in shipping lanes.
   U.S. officials insist that a mine threat still exists, mainly in
the northern Gulf, and the Navy is still debating what to do with
the wooden-hulled, Korean War vintage minesweepers.

   Relatives of an Air Force pilot
killed in the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya said Saturday they don't trust
Moammar Gadhafi and want an autopsy performed on the body to be
certain it is the flier's.
   The Air Force telephoned the Ribas Dominicci family in Puerto
Rico on Friday night to inform them the body released by Libya had
been identified in Italy as that of Fernando Ribas Dominicci. The
33-year-old airman was killed during the April 15, 1986 raids on
Libya.
   ``After getting over this shock, we have asked the Pentagon for a
complete autopsy to know the cause of his death,'' '' said the slain
pilot's brother, Salvador.
   He said he also wants a family doctor to certify whether it is
Ribas Dominicci's body.
   Libyan authorities turned over the body Friday to the papal
representative in Tripoli. They said it belonged to Capt. Paul
Lorence, 31, of San Francisco.
   Lorence and Ribas Dominicci, a native of Utuado, Puerto Rico,
piloted the F-111 bomber that was the only plane lost in the raids
on Libya. The other body was never found, the Libyans said.
   ``They were only four inches apart in the cabin,'' said the
brother, a 38-year-old attorney who spoke by telephone from the
western city of Mayaguez, 80 miles west of San Juan.
   The pilot was the youngest of six brothers. Fernando Ribas
Dominicci also left a wife, Blanca, and a son, also named Fernando,
who is now 7 years old. They live in Austin, Texas.
   The Italian news agency ANSA quoted an Italian forensic expert
among three Italians and three Americans who helped identify the
body as saying, ``The identification was made possible on the basis
of the comparision of teeth'' with documents provided by U.S.
authorities. ANSA said the body was well preserved.
   Ribas Dominicci said the family has doubts because of a Libyan
television report and pictures of the body when it was found, three
months after the raid. The broadcast said the body had been washed
ashore and identified it as Lorence's.
   ``No body is in good condition after floating in the water for
three months,'' said Ribas Dominicci.
   He said the family also is skeptical of Gadhafi's motives, saying
it could be a publicity stunt.
   ``With Ghadhafi, I don't discard any possibility,'' he said.
   Ribas Dominicci said his 87-year-old father had not been told of
the development because he is ill.
   ``This is like reliving a sad episode,'' he said.

   As Nancy Reagan prepares to leave the pomp and
pageantry of eight years in the White House, she wants to be
remembered for her work against drug abuse rather than her penchant
for borrowing high-priced, designer gowns.
   ``I'm very happy that I was able to help the (fashion) industry,
but I hope that's not the thing I'm remembered for. I hope I'm
remembered for the drug program and the help to children,'' the
first lady said.
   Her voice reduced to a mere whisper by a severe bout of
laryngitis, Mrs. Reagan reviewed the ups and downs of her years in
Washington in a 45-minute farewell interview on Thursday with The
Associated Press.
   Sipping coffee from a delicate white and gold china cup in the
Yellow Oval Room of the mansion's private quarters, Mrs. Reagan
discussed the disclosure that she had ignored the pledge she made in
1982 to abstain from borrowing high-priced designer clothes and
gowns.
   ``I was just trying to help an industry that I could help and I
was in the position to help. I didn't see anything wrong with
that,'' Mrs. Reagan said.
   Mrs. Reagan noted that America's top designers have given her
their ``Lifetime Achievement Award'' for her contribution to the
fashion industry.
   ``Whenever anybody talked about fashion, they would think French,
Dior, whatever. They never thought about American. Well, now
American designers are taken seriously abroad. There is a
competition that is just wonderful,'' the first lady said.
   Attempting to counter critics who have said her actions amounted
to free advertising for several of her favorite designers, Mrs.
Reagan insisted: ``I wasn't advertising for these people. I was
trying to promote and help one of the biggest industries in our
country. ... They are all very grateful, and nobody saw anything
wrong with it.''
   Turning to the work she wants to be identified with, Mrs. Reagan
said she has had some silent victories in her battle against drug
abuse, receiving ``a lot of letters from kids ... or parents that
I've been able to help'' in instances that few people know about.
   She said she regretted that ``there's always those kids that you
haven't been able to get to, and you haven't been able to reach.''
She added that she intended to keep working through the anti-drug
abuse center named after her that is to be built near Los Angeles.
   ``I don't believe in retirement,'' she said.
   Mrs. Reagan said she was saddened to learn that Jason Brady, a
16-year-old suffering from cancer who had visited her a week before
Christmas through the ``Make-A-Wish'' foundation, had died.
   ``He said he wanted to come here ... he said, `I've seen you on
television, and I want to tell you that I admire you, and I know
that you've been a great support to your husband,''' she said, her
voice softening. ``He died on Christmas Day.''
   Queried about criticism from consumer advocate Ralph Nader that
she and President Reagan have not included warnings against tobacco
in their lectures against drug abuse, Mrs. Reagan held up a finger
for emphasis. ``I agree with him,'' she said. ``It's as addictive as
any of the other drugs, (including) alcohol.''
   The first lady went on to say she hoped one of her aides, a
smoker who was present in the room, ``is listening.'' Mrs. Reagan
has been known to rigorously keep after White House personnel who
smoke, insisting they get help to kick their habit.
   Looking back over her eight years in the White House, Mrs. Reagan
said she had not anticipated that life in the executive mansion
``would be as confining'' as it turned out to be. ``Certainly after
Ronnie's shooting, (in March 1981) everything tightened up,'' she
said.
   ``It always bothered Ronnie that he created such a to-do when we
went to a restaurant. And this entourage of cars _ that always
bothered him,'' Mrs. Reagan said of the 20-plus vehicles that the
Secret Service organizes for a presidential motorcade.
   President-elect Bush and his wife Barbara are expected to keep up
their active social life, and Mrs. Reagan said she hoped ``they'll
find their own way'' to get out and about, despite security concerns.
   Mrs. Reagan said she and her husband ``are happy'' they will
continue to receive Secret Service protection after they leave the
White House.
   One subject Mrs. Reagan refused to discuss was former Reagan
chief of staff Donald T. Regan's revelation that she had used an
astrologer to help formulate the president's schedule. ``Read my
book,'' she quipped, promising to deal with the subject in her
memoirs, which she said are due out in the fall.
   Of Regan, who blamed the first lady for organizing his ouster in
the wake of allegations he had mismanaged the White House during the
Iran-Contra affair, Mrs. Reagan was curt.
   Asked if Reagan was happy with his former aide, Mrs. Reagan said
simply, ``He's not.'' Asked if she'd changed her mind about Regan,
who was harshly critical of her involvement in White House affairs
in his book, ``For the Record,'' she whispered, ``No.''
   Of the ``kiss-and-tell'' books that many Reagan aides have
written, Mrs. Reagan said she finds them to be ``reckless kinds of
books.''
   ``I think they're terrible. ... there's an implied trust, and
when you leave and write these books, you're breaking that trust,''
she said.
   The first lady said she has a formula for dealing with such
books, including any that come out in the future.
   ``I won't read them,'' she said, with stern look. ``I haven't
read any of the others.''
   The first lady said the barrage of criticism she'd encountered
upon entering the White House _ spurred by stories about her
privately-funded purchases of $209,000 of new china and a $730,000
redecoration of the White House _ had been ``a big surprise.''
   ``I had one disadvantage that Ronnie didn't have. I came in with
terrible press,'' she said. ``I never had that before. ... It made
me pull back. ... There was a hurdle on both sides .. you all
getting to know me and my getting to be a little hesitant, afraid.''
   Even eight years later, Mrs. Reagan still appeared upset about
reports that she wanted President Carter and his wife Rosalynn to
move out of the White House prior to the Reagan inauguration. ``I
never said that,'' Mrs. Reagan said, again her finger pointing for
emphasis.
   As she rose to leave, Mrs. Reagan was eager to offer some ``word
of wisdom'' for future first ladies, as well as all married women:
``Do your own thing. Don't be afraid to give your opinion. Just
because you're married doesn't mean you've given up your right to
have an opinion.''

   The Kremlin took direct control of a region claimed
by two rival republics, the Tass news agency said Saturday, in the
government's most determined bid to calm its worst pocket of ethnic
unrest.
   The decree keeps the Nagorno-Karabakh region within the southern
republic of Azerbaijan and rejects demands that it become part of
the neighboring republic of Armenia.
   Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia are mainly Christian and Azerbaijan
is predominately Moslem.
   A commission led by Arkady Volsky, the Kremlin's representative
in Azerbaijan's troubled region of Nagorno-Karabakh, can suspend
local governing councils, administrative bodies and informal
organizations, and oversee the mass media, publishing, health and
education, Tass said.
   The declaration was adopted ``in connection with the persistent
strain in inter-ethnic relations in Nagorno-Karabakh and around it
with a view to preventing their further aggravation and to
stabilizing the situation in the region,'' the official news agency
said.
   The decision was made Thursday by the Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet, the country's highest executive body, but released only
Saturday by the Tass news agency. Previous reports had said only
that a ``special situation'' had been imposed on Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The decree was billed as a temporary measure but did not say how
long it will last or when new elections will be held. It did not say
who besides Volsky will serve on the committee.
   More than 60 people have been killed and about 200,000 have fled
their homes as a result of the dispute that flared up in February
1988 over control of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan and Moscow have
rejected annexation, and the Kremlin instead opted for a long-term
economic and social development program.
   But that has not stopped the unrest, which last erupted into
violence in mid-November. Military rule and a strict curfew was
imposed on the Armenian capital Yerevan, the Azerbaijani capital
Baku, and other cities.
   Top Kremlin officials, including President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
have reacted angrily to demands for annexation that have continued
after the Dec. 7 earthquake that devastated northern Armenia and
killed about 25,000 people.
   Armenian activists say several of their leaders have been
arrested and held in administrative detention.
   Tass said that under the decree the powers of Nagorno-Karabakh's
legislature and executive bodies ``shall be suspended until the
holding of elections of a new composition of the Soviet.
   ``The committee shall be entrusted with the task of being in
charge of the local bodies of state power and administration of
Nagorno-Karabakh,'' it said.
   Courts and prosecutors in the disputed territory will work under
new regulations to be imposed by the procurator-general, Ministry of
Justice and the Supreme Court, Tass said.
   ``The committee shall have the right to suspend the activities of
public organizations and independently-acting associations if they
run counter to the Constitution and legislation of the U.S.S.R., or,
if necessary, to dissolve them,'' Tass said.
   That provision apparently was aimed at the informal organizations
formed by activists to push demands for annexation by Armenia.
   Official Azerbaijani newspapers have complained that officials in
Nagorno-Karabakh practically stopped obeying any orders from Baku.
   Lengthy strikes have been reported in the area's largest city,
Stepanakert. The latest violence erupted after reports reached
Azerbaijan that Armenia had sent settlers into Nagorno-Karabakh to
build a factory and boost the region's ethnic Armenian majority.

   A court Saturday convicted four leading members of a
left-wing terrorist group of murdering French industrialist Georges
Besse and sentenced them to life in prison.
   Nathalie Menigon, 31 and Joelle Aubron, 28, were convicted of
carrying out the shooting death of the Renault chief on Nov. 17,
1986. Menigon's companion, Jean-Marc Rouillan, 33, and Georges
Cipriani, 38, were convicted of complicity.
   Seven judges, concurring to demands of State Prosecutor Galiber
d'Auque, ruled the four must spend at least 18 years behind bars
before they are eligible for parole.
   The panel, which sits only on terrorism cases, deliberated for 75
minutes after hearing five days of testimony.
   The defendants had boycotted the court since the second day of
the trial. None was present when the verdict was read.
   All four are top members of Direct Action, which started as a
French group that bombed French institutions, usually during the
night when buildings were empty and no one could be hurt.
   But over the last few years, a deadly European branch has evolved
with links to West Germany's Red Army Faction and Belgium's
Communist Fighting Cells.
   The group was largely rendered ineffective when the four were
arrested at a farm south of Paris and all their documents were
confiscated. Among them was the original draft of a statement
claiming responsibility for Besse's assassination. Police also found
weapons allegedly used in the killing and a piece of the black suit
Besse was wearing when he died.
   The auto executive was killed near his home in southern Paris as
he returned from work.
   Direct Action pamphlets were found in a nearby subway station,
but the group did not formally claim responsibility for the murder
until Feb. 11, nearly three months later.
   Besse's widow, Francoise, and their five children attended the
week's hearings.
   ``The most important thing for me is that this trial took place,
and with dignity,'' she said, refusing to comment on the verdicts.

   Two African students were released Saturday after
spending two weeks in prison for allegedly participating in a fight
with Chinese that sparked racial unrest in four cities.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Dossoumou Boni Lodovic of
Benin and Alpha Robinson of Gambia were freed one day before their
15-day sentence was to end. It said Robinson thanked his prison
guards.
   A Congolese student at Hehai University in Nanking said the two
men had gone to Beijing and had been given until Tuesday to leave
China. Their whereabouts in the capital were not immediately known.
   The student, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said most of
Nanking's 139 African students continued to boycott classes and
wanted to leave China.
   The Xinhua report said that Alex Dzabaku Dosoo, a student from
Ghana who also was arrested in connection with the Christmas Eve
brawl, was released from jail on Jan. 10 and put under house arrest
at Hehai.
   But the Congolese student said the report was false.
   ``Dosoo is not at Hehai,'' he said. ``The men released today said
he is still in jail.''
   The Ghanian Embassy has demanded Dosoo's release and has
threatened to withdraw all of its 26 students from China. It is the
only African country to do so.
   The Xinhua report said three Chinese also have been given 15-day
sentences in connection with the brawl.
   Racial unrest erupted in China on Christmas Eve when African
students fought Chinese after doorkeepers refused to let two Chinese
women attend an African party.
   The fight touched off five days of anti-black protests in Nanking
during which angry mobs of Chinese youth threw rocks and bottles at
African student dormitories and shouted ``Down with black devils.''
   As the week wore on, the protests lost much of their racist
flavor and began turning against the Chinese government. A strong
police presence in Nanking soon quelled the marches.
   The unrest spread to Hangzhou in the east, the central industrial
city of Wuhan and Beijing.
   A 10-day class boycott by African students in Hangzhou ended on
Jan. 5. On Saturday, some of the 500 African students at the Beijing
Languages Institute remained on strike. In Wuhan, one foreign
student was injured when a Chinese youth threw a rock through his
window on Dec. 29.
   The three African students were arrested on Dec. 31 by about 400
Chinese militiamen who attacked a guest house on the outskirts of
Nanking. Most of the African students from Nanking had been forced
to the guest house on Dec. 26 by Chinese police who refused to allow
them to travel to Beijing.
   African students allege that during the arrests Chinese
paramilitary forces used electric truncheons to shock and beat the
African students. The Chinese have denied the charge.
   The Xinhua report quoted Liang Ruiju, president of Hehai
University, as saying he believed ``the foreign students in our
university are still kids.''
   ``I hope they will return to their normal school activities as
soon as possible,'' he said.
   About 1,500 Africans receive Chinese scholarships as part of
Beijing's policy to emphasize its ties to the Third World.

   A U.S. Air Force jet Saturday carried homeward the
body of an American pilot killed three years ago in the bombing of
Libya, which said it released the remains as a ``humanitarian
initiative.''
   Italian and American medical experts identified the body Friday
as that of Air Force Maj. Fernando Ribas Dominicci, 33, of Utuado,
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Salvador Ribas Dominicci, a brother of the slain pilot, said the
family does not trust Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi and wants the
Pentagon to conduct another autopsy after the body arrives in the
United States.
   Libya had said the body it flew to Rome on Friday was that of
Capt. Paul Lorence, 31, of San Francisco, who was in the plane with
Ribas Dominicci during the raid over Libya on April 15, 1986. The
body has been well preserved and medical authorities checked the
identity with dental and fingerprint records, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported.
   Libya's official news agency JANA on Friday reported that only
one body was ever found after U.S. fighter jets bombed the Libyan
capital of Tripoli and Benghazi, another coastal city.
   Ribas Dominicci said the family was shocked when it was told that
the body flown out of Libya had been identified as his brother.
   ``We have asked the Pentagon to do a complete autopsy to know the
cause of his death,'' he said in a telephone interview from Mayaguez
city, 80 miles west of San Juan. ``This is like reliving a sad
episode in our lives,'' he added.
   He said he also wants a family doctor to certify that it is his
brother's body.
   Returned with the body were a wedding ring, 14 bullets, a knife,
a cigarette lighter, $59 and 10 British pounds (worth about $18),
JANA reported.
   Lt. Cliff Atkinson, a spokesman at Dover Air Force Base in Dover,
Del., said the body was taken first to the Torrejon Air Base in
Spain. A Pentagon spokesman, Army Lt. Col. Steven Titunik, said the
remains would be flown from there to Dover on Monday.
   Ribas Dominicci said the family was told there would be a
military ceremony when the body arrived at Dover.
   Six blue-uniformed Marines solemnly carried the flag-draped
casket to a C-141 transport plane at Rome's Ciampino airport.
   U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb and Charge d'Affaires James F.
Creagan of the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican placed hand over heart as
the coffin passed them. Air Attache Col. James Ray saluted briskly.
   Libya flew the body to Italy on Friday using the services of
Monsignor Giovanni Martinelli, the Vatican's representative in
Tripoli.
   Martinelli told Vatican Radio that Libya had made ``a gesture
showing the desire to reconcile, to start again.''
   This came during a period of international debate over a Libyan
plant the United States says can produce chemical weapons, and nine
days after U.S. fighters shot down two Libyan jets over the
Mediterranean.
   JANA, monitored in Rome and London, said U.S. fighter planes
buzzed a Libyan Airlines plane flying to Istanbul on Tuesday. The
Pentagon said it had no information about the incident.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman welcomed
the return of the body and said the action was part of Libya's
humanitarian obligations.
   Gadhafi was quoted as saying in a Dec. 24 dispatch that he was
returning the body ``especially since this occasion coincides with
the end of the rule of the Reagan administration.''
   Reagan ordered the 1986 attack in retaliation for alleged Libyan
support of terrorists.
   Seventeen other U.S. Air Force bombers involved in the raid
returned safely after dropping about 100 tons of bombs.

<TEXT>
   From pork rinds to power boats, from 7:15 a.m.
workday starts to spur-of-the-moment shopping jaunts, George Herbert
Walker Bush already is setting a pace and a style far different from
the man he will succeed.
   The nation's 41st president is a man of aristocratic breeding and
down-home tastes. He enjoys country music, dropping by Sears to buy
power tools, jogging a mile or two. His drink of choice is a vodka
martini, his idea of competitive sports is a good game of
horseshoes, his suits are tailor-made.
   During his campaign, Bush often joked that one of his hardest
tasks during eight years as Ronald Reagan's vice president was
``keeping my charisma in check.''
   As Bush nears his inauguration, he has exhibited a salty,
easygoing confidence that, if not everyone's idea of charisma, is at
least sharply at odds with the onetime perception of him as awkward
in public, whiny of voice, and wimpy in demeanor.
   Bush still speaks in bursts and with a syntax that is often
haphazard. He sprinkles his conversation with phrases such as
``going ballistic'' and ``I'm not going to get all tense,'' and
talks about ``the drug thing'' or the ``Persian Gulf thing.''
   But Bush seems far more at ease with himself now, and has
exhibited a quick-wittedness, particularly in his dealings with
reporters, that seemed to be missing in the past.
   After avoiding regular contact with reporters during his
campaign, Bush now admits that he relishes the give-and-take of news
conferences, and has held a dozen or so of them since his election.
   His humor is often self-deprecating, as when a reporter recently
began a question: ``Mr. Vice President. Do you ever stop to think _
''
   ``Not often,'' Bush interrupted.
   Bush, 64, said in a recent interview that he shared with wife
Barbara upon rising one morning a few days ago a sudden revelation:
``I feel excited about this job.''
   Bush has made it clear he intends to be up and about _ a prospect
that must make the Secret Service nervous and which doesn't make
reporters' jobs any easier.
   ``I'm not going to be isolated and cut off. Say I want to go buy
a suit. I want to eat Peking duck. And I don't want to have to spend
a lot of time worrying about where people are. I want to say, `I'm
ready to go, let's go,'' he said.
   Bush's forays into town are becoming legendary _ remindful of the
unannounced trips President Lyndon Johnson used to take.
   He buys bagels at a local delicatessen, makes frequent trips to a
Washington men's shop to be fitted for suits, goes out himself to
buy presents for his wife, and often drops by the local Safeway to
pick up a few groceries.
   Bush enjoys playing tennis with his family and with tennis pros,
and as vice president and president-elect often dropped in
unannounced at the gymnasium in the House Rayburn Office Building to
work out with former colleagues.
   He enjoys restaurants, often lingering for hours over meals with
friends and guests.
   In his beloved vacation home of Kennebunkport, Maine, Bush
frequently takes unannounced walks through the village, patronizes
local shops, takes his boat out for a spin, goes fishing, jogs
through the neighborhood.
   At his oceanside family compound, he uses one cottage as an
office, where he does his own typing on an electric typerwriter set
up at his desk.
   On a recent visit, he shushed reporters asking him questions
while he was fishing in a local river _ telling them not to scare
away the fish. However, he admitted, he never caught fish at that
particular spot anyway. So why did he return there? ``I like to
cast,'' he said.
   He also enjoys throttling up his sleek 28-foot Cigarette boat,
``Fidelity,'' crashing through Atlantic Ocean waves at speeds up to
50 mph, sometimes appearing to relish in leaving a Coast Guard
``chase'' boat in his spray.
   Although Bush kept the boat in the Chesapeake Bay, near
Washington, one summer, he says he has no plans to move it to the
Potomac River when he moves to the White House _ that wouldn't do
justice to the ocean-going craft, he says, comparing it to a
thoroughbred horse.
   While Bush seems certain to continue his visits to the family
estate in Kennebunkport during warm weather, he has indicated he
plans to spend a lot of time at Camp David, the presidential retreat
in Maryland; and is reportedly eyeing the purchase of a condominium
in the Florida Keys, where he enjoys fishing.
   The former oil industry executive, while claiming Texas as his
adopted home, does not back away from his New England roots or his
good fortune at birth, once joking that his forefathers had come on
the Mayflower _ you could tell them because they all were holding
Bloomingdale's shopping bags, he said.
   But at the same time, he's a man who enjoys country music,
watching rented video tapes and who sometimes drives around the
Naval Observatory grounds, where the vice presidential residence is
located, because he's chauffeured everywhere else.
   Then there's the Bush family enthusiasm for sports _ from tennis
to horseshoes. When Bush talks about a ``six pack,'' he's not
talking beer _ although he's been known to enjoy one on occasion _
but about wrapping successive horseshoes around the pole.
   Bush once even suggested that horseshoes was ``the national
sport,'' and has hinted he plans to install a horseshoe pit on the
White House grounds.
   Bush, trim at six-foot-two, runs several times a week, usually
doing about two miles at a time.
   And, while he is known to enjoy fine meals in good restaurants,
he also has a fondness for junk food _ downing pork rinds and
smothering nearly everything in hot sauce, even tuna fish sandwiches.
   The diet doesn't seem to have hurt his health. Bush has an
enviable cholesterol count of 192.
   Bush is being sworn in as president after serving as Reagan's
vice president since 1981. It will be the first time Bush has served
in elective office, in his own right, since he represented Texas in
the House in the late 1960s.
   In the years since, he served in a string of high-level
appointive posts, including ambassador to the United Nations, envoy
to the People's Republic of China, chairman of the Republican
National Committee and director of the Central Intelligence Agency.

   Police found a stolen car Saturday that officers
had chased before their cruiser went out of control and collided
with a truck, killing two officers, police said.
   The officers were pursuing the stolen vehicle on a rain-slick
street Friday night when their car spun out of control, crossed the
median and collided nearly head-on with a pickup.
   Officers on patrol found the car in the vicinity of the accident,
police spokesman Ed Spencer said, but as for the driver, ``we have
no suspects,'' he said.
   Officer Lisa Louise Sandel, 27, died Friday night at Parkland
Memorial Hospital. Her partner, Mark Fleming, 24, died after
emergency surgery at Parkland early Saturday.
   An officer-trainee, Nathaniel White, 25, who was riding in the
police car, and the driver of the truck, Earl Henderson, 62, were
injured. Both remained hospitalized Saturday, White in critical
condition and Henderson in fair condition.

   Interior Secretary Donald Hodel edged out
Energy Secretary John Herrington for top honors in the Senators' Ski
Cup Saturday, but the fastest senator in the field said that's
because Cabinet members have more idle time.
   ``It just goes to show you that Cabinet members have more time to
practice their skiing than senators,'' quipped Sen. Robert Kasten,
R-Wis., who finished third in the event sponsored by Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah.
   The event, now in its third year, drew 17 senators and was
expected to raise more than $100,000 for Salt Lake City's Primary
Children's Medical Center, Garn said.
   There was one mishap on the 20-gate slalom course when Sen. Steve
Symms, R-Idaho, fell and dislocated a shoulder. Idaho's junior
senator returned a short time later to watch the afternoon's races
with his arm in a sling.
   ``I decided to go a little faster than I should have and I caught
a gate. But what the heck, it was for a good cause,'' he said.
   Beginning skier Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said, ``If you could
handicap my skiing like you do golf, I'd be skiing about a 120.''
   Also skiing was Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., showing how well he has
recovered since spending seven months in intensive care following
brain surgery last year.
   Biden, an early contender in the 1988 race for the Democratic
presidential nomination, dismissed claims before the race that he
was the favorite.
   ``That's what they said about the Democratic nomination,'' he
said.

   Two Palestinian girls died Saturday from bullet
wounds suffered in clashes with Israeli soldiers, and troops in the
occupied lands wounded at least 19 other Arabs, hospital and army
officials said.
   The deaths brought to four the number of young Arabs killed by
army gunfire in two days and raised to 355 the number of
Palestinians killed in the 13-month-old uprising in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. Fifteen Israelis have died.
   In annexed east Jerusalem, police fired tear gas to disperse Arab
stone-throwers. Israel radio said authorities safely dismantled a
bomb left at a major road junction near the city.
   In east Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital, 14-year-old Rana Al-Masri
died of wounds suffered in a Jan. 7 clash in the West Bank city of
Nablus, the army said. Arab reports said she was shot in the head
with a plastic bullet.
   Residents in Nablus called a strike to mourn the girl's death,
and Arab students left schools to march in protest of the killing,
an Arab reporter in the city said.
   Arab hospital officials reported 16 Palestinians wounded in
clashes with troops Saturday in the West Bank cities of Rafah and
Nablus and in the Gaza Strip. The army confirmed seven wounded in
those areas, plus three in the West Bank city of Bethlehem.
   Most of the wounded were teen-agers.
   A 12-year-old Palestinian girl, Hanadi Abu-Sultan, died at the
Tel Hashomer Hospital near Tel Aviv after troops shot her in the
head in a Jan. 10 clash at the Shati refugee camp in Gaza Strip, the
military command said.
   On Friday, two 15-year-old Palestinians died after being shot by
troops in clashes.
   The army, in an apparent effort to prevent disturbances, clamped
a curfew on Shati, a beachside shantytown in Gaza City housing about
42,000 Palestinians.
   Curfews were also imposed on Rafah, Deir el-Balah and Nuseirat
camps, which have a combined population of almost 100,000.
   But Palestinian protests, sparked by the death of Ms. Abu-Sultan
and another Gaza teenager a day before, erupted in many areas of the
southern strip.
   Merchants in Gaza continued a commercial strike begun Friday to
protest Israeli raids to collect taxes. Non-payment of taxes is a
major tactic of the revolt against Israeli occupation.
   Also Saturday, a senior Israeli defense official, Uri Lubrani,
said the PLO has not conducted any attacks against northern Israel
or Israel's self-proclaimed security zone in Lebanon since PLO
chairman Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism.
   The zone is a 6- to 10-mile-wide strip along the border that
Israel created in 1985. It is patrolled by a small contingent of
Israeli forces and the allied South Lebanon Army militia.
   Palestine Liberation Organization groups have staged attacks on
troops and militiamen patrolling the zone, fired rockets at Israel's
northern settlements or attempted to infiltrate Israel on
hostage-taking operations.
   Lubrani, coordinator of Israeli actions in Lebanon, said the
hostilities have stopped since Arafat last month renounced terrorism
and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   But Lubrani said he could not yet assess the PLO position.
   ``I think it is too early to judge, and time will say,'' he said
on Israel radio. ``At the moment, they are leaning somehow toward a
status quo, no violent actions. But how long this will last I cannot
tell you. This can last until tonight.''

   Former PTL president Richard Dortch has
pleaded innocent to charges that he conspired with his former boss,
Jim Bakker, to divert millions of dollars in ministry donations for
his own use.
   Dortch, Bakker's onetime top deputy at PTL, was to to appear in
federal court Tuesday, but he waived his right to attend the
arraignment in papers filed Wednesday.
   He pleaded not guilty to charges of wire fraud, mail fraud and
conspiracy. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 120 years in
prison and more than $5 million in fines.
   Dortch, 57, and Bakker, 49, were indicted Dec. 5 following a
16-month grand jury investigation into how PTL operated under
Bakker. They are accused of conspiring to raise money to support
lavish lifestyles and of diverting more than $4 million in donations.
   Bakker resigned from PTL in March 1987 in the midst of a
sex-and-money scandal. His arraignment is still scheduled for
Tuesday.

   The mayor has promised to fire
those responsible for placing racist letters in the lockers of two
black policemen threatening them with violence if they took a
promotional exam.
   The incident was revealed Friday by Police Chief Donald Burnett,
who also promised to request an FBI investigation if those
responsible don't come forward within a week.
   ``The unacceptable conduct exhibited was blatant racial bigotry
against two black officers,'' said Mayor Evlyn Wilcox. ``The person
or persons involved used threats and written language of the lowest
order.''
   Officials said an internal investigation is focusing on employees
of the police department, and Ms. Wilcox said those identified as
the letters' writers would be fired.
   The mayor also issued a public apology to the officers, who were
not identified.
   The letters, signed by a group calling itself the ``Aryan Police
Officers Association,'' threatened to harm the officers and their
families if they took an oral examination they must pass to be
considered for promotion to the rank of corporal. Both officers took
the test.
   The incident was the latest of several in which black officers in
this city of 900,000 some 55 miles east of Los Angeles have been
threatened or harassed anonymously by others in the department,
officials said.
   Several weeks ago, a black patrolman found black shoe polish
smeared in his locker, officials said. A few days after that, the
same officer found his locker sprayed with black paint. That officer
also took the promotional exam.
   The letters the other two officers received said the Aryan Police
Officers Association had infiltrated the Police Department's
five-member oral exam board and had already decided which officers
would be promoted, City Councilman Tom Minor said. Approximately 70
officers have applied for three openings.
   Councilman Michael Maudsley discounted the possibility the board
had been infiltrated, however, noting one board member is black.

<HEAD>Freezing Rain Across Lower Ohio Valley</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Freezing rain and sleet hindered motorists across the lower Ohio
Valley Saturday, while snow fell from Missouri to Illinois.
   Numerous traffic accidents were reported throughout the lower
Ohio Valley as freezing rain slickened roads. Fifteen accidents
occurred within a few minutes in Charleston, W.Va., and some roads
were closed in northeast Georgia because of slick conditions.
   Snow fell from west-central Missouri to west-central Illinois
Saturday morning. The heaviest snowfall was over south-central
Missouri, where Columbia received 4 inches.
   Elsewhere, snow continued to fall over the Cascade Mountains in
the Pacific Northwest and heavy rainfall was expected to create
flooding problems in portions of western Tennessee and south-central
Kentucky due to the already saturated ground and swollen streams
from previous rainfall.
   Three inches of snow fell on the coastal mountains of Oregon and
2 inches accumulated in western Washington.
   Rain was falling from western Tennessee to the Mississippi Gulf
Coast. Flash flood watches were posted for the western two-thirds of
Tennessee and for south-central Kentucky.
   A cold front moving across the northern Plains and central
Rockies was producing gusty winds as it passed. Snow showers were
also occurring behind this front in North Dakota, reducing
visibility to near zero across parts of north-central North Dakota.
   In Norman, Okla., snowfall totaled up to 8{ inches.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 14
degrees below zero at Gunnison, Colo., to 85 degrees at Fort Myers,
Fla. The low in the nation Saturday morning was 35 degrees below
zero at Gunnison, Colo.
   Sunday's forecast called for rain from Alabama across the
southern and mid-Atlantic states into southern New England; a
mixture of snow, rain and freezing rain from northeast New York to
southern Maine; snow over the rest of Maine; rain along the northern
Pacific coast; snow in the northern intermountain region of the
Pacific Northwest; and strong and gusty winds in the northern

   High temperatures were forecast in the teens and 20s in the
central Rockies and from the northern Plains across the upper
Mississippi Valley to northern portions of the upper Great Lakes; in
the 50s and 60s along the California coast as well as from southern
California across southern Arizona and New Mexico, parts of Texas

   Leftist guerrillas ambushed a group of
goldminers in a jungle village and killed 15 people, police said
Saturday.
   The miners were walking to their barracks Thursday in the small
town of El Colorado, about 433 miles southeast of Lima, when a
column of 50 guerrillas opened fire with machine guns, police said.
   Police blamed the Maoist Shining Path movement. According to
government figures, at least 60 people, half of them police
officers, have been slain by Shining Path guerrillas during the
first two weeks of this year.
   The miners were part of a predominately Indian labor force that
works the gold-bearing jungle rivers.
   Police said it was unclear why the guerrillas attacked the miners
and gave no more details on the massacre.

<TEXT>
   Britain made its first direct contact with
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and discussed the formation of a Middle
East peace conference, but drew criticism on Saturday from Israel.
   William Waldegrave, Britain's deputy foreign affairs minister who
met with Arafat Friday night, also planned to meet Monday with Arab
League Secretary General Chedli Klibi, the Tunis-based organization
said Saturday.
   Waldegrave said his two-hour meeting with Arafat ``constitutes a
major development in the policies of Great Britain.''
   The talks demonstrated that the world was changing and Israel
``had to change as well or it would risk being left behind,'' said
Waldegrave, who is to visit Israel in early March.
   Arafat characterized the talks, held at the home of PLO Tunisia
representative Hakam Balaoui, as ``fruitful, constructive and
useful.''
   In London, Israeli Ambassador Yoav Biran said Saturday he
regretted what he called the ``unwarranted rush of British
politicians'' to meet Arafat and the PLO.
   ``The road towards peace in the Middle East does not lead through
the PLO,'' he said. ``Behind the PLO's `charm offensive' directed at
the West, this organization adheres to its unchanged policies by
words that are directed at Arab audiences and by continued attempts
at terrorism directed at Israel.''
   Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said on Friday that
the British were well aware of Israel's attitude toward the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Israel opposes an international peace conference on the Middle
East and refuses to negotiate with the PLO, which it maintains is a
terrorist organization.
   Waldegrave and Arafat, who met with reporters after their talks,
agreed that any Arab-Israeli peace conference should be sponsored by
the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, including
the United States and the Soviet Union.
   Arafat said other participants should include ``all concerned
parties, the PLO or our provisional government, Israel, Egypt,
Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.''
   It was the first time Arafat mentioned the possibility of a
provisional government sitting at a peace conference in the name of
Palestinians since the Palestine National Council, a sort of
parliament-in-exile for the PLO, decided to establish one at a
meeting in Algiers Nov. 15.
   Asked how Britain could help bring about an international
conference, Waldegrave said he did not want to exaggerate his
country's role. But he added that London has special contacts with
the United States, other European governments and a number of Arab
states.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher gave the go-ahead for
the meeting after the Arafat's public renunciation of terrorism and
implicit recognition of Israeli's right to exist in December.
   ``The intefadeh has had an extraordinary effect on international
public opinion and on Great Britain in particular,'' Waldegrave
added, referring to more than a year of unrest by Palestinians
living under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At
least 355 Palestinians and 15 Israelis have died in the violence.
   Britain ruled Palestine before Israel was established in 1948.

   Florida lawmakers met Saturday with hundreds of
Nicaraguan immigrants living at a stadium to pledge support but
warned that funds to help refugees assimilate ``don't come easily.''
   Newly elected U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, Mayor Xavier Suarez and U.S.
Rep. E. Clay Shaw visited the Bobby Maduro Miami Stadium to examine
the problems facing the growing number of Nicaraguan arrivals. A
total of 263 Nicaraguans are living at the stadium.
   Shaw, a Republican congressman from Fort Lauderdale, pledged his
efforts in Washington ``so that Miami won't have to take on alone
the financial burden of these new refugee arrivals.''
   ``The reality is that those (federal) funds don't come easily''
to help find jobs and homes for immigrants streaming across the
Texas border from Mexico and seeking political asylum, said Mack, a
Republican from Cape Coral.
   ``But it is important that we understand a lot must be done to
find a solution to the problem,'' Mack said through Suarez, who
acted as an interpreter.
   Miami officials are worried that the latest wave of Nicaraguans
pouring into the city will overburden facilities like schools and
hospitals.
   The Central Americans began arriving from southern Texas by the
busload Thursday and Friday, following a federal judge's ruling that
the government could not keep them there while their applications
for political asylum were being processed.
   The Nicaraguans maintain that they are fleeing oppression by
their country's leftist Sandinista government. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service says the immigrants are not eligible for
asylum if they actually are fleeing bad economic conditions in their
homeland, which has been hurt by a U.S. trade embargo.
   Since the judge's decision Monday, about 400 people have come
here, bringing the two-month total to about 2,000, most of them
Nicaraguans. Officials expect about 100,000 more to make their way
to this heavily Hispanic city during the next 18 months.
   A delegation of community leaders visited southern Texas on
Friday to warn those awaiting transportation to Miami.
   ``They need to know that they're going to have to fend for
themselves,'' Tony Ojeda, and assistant county manager from Dade
County, said in Harlingen, Texas.
   Shaw recalled an earlier meeting he had in the Nicaraguan capital
of Managua with President Daniel Ortega.
   ``He's ruining your country,'' Shaw said of the Sandinista
leader, ``and I pledge full support for the Contras.''
   His call was met by cheers in Spanish to the effect of ``long
live democracy'' and ``communism out.''
   Mack told the refugees he plans to speak with President-elect
Bush about the refugees. He already had contacted Attorney General
Richard Thornburgh to help coordinate federal efforts, he said.
   Huge piles of used clothing were gathered under a palm tree
outside the stadium, and a church group was distributing free orange
drinks and chili dogs to those in the shelter _ as well as to dozens
more camping outside the stadium who arrived after authorities
declared the shelter full.
   One refugee who arrived too late to get a cot under the bleachers
was Sergio Lezama, 54, of Managua. The lawyer said he has slept at a
friend's house since his arrival.
   ``I don't have a family here in Miami,'' he said, ``so I'm just
waiting here hoping for some place to live and some work.''
   The refugees at the baseball stadium will be relocated to Beckham
Hall, a county facility, before Jan. 25, when the Baltimore Orioles
baseball team arrives for spring training, officials said.
   ``We have something arranged with the county (for those
accommodations),'' Suarez said.

<TEXT>
   She was a dedicated doctor who had gone to
Bellevue Hospital on her day off to work on a pathology lecture. He
was a former Bellevue mental patient who moved unchallenged through
its halls in a lab coat and stethoscope.
   She was bright, bubbly and caring, a 33-year-old South Carolina
native who came north to pursue her medical career and was expecting
her first child. He was a 23-year-old from Brooklyn who once yearned
for a career in baseball but had instead a history of petty crimes
and psychiatric problems.
   The paths of Kathryn Hinnant and Steven Smith crossed when he
stopped by the tiny office where she was working. During a violent
struggle, police say, he beat, strangled and raped her, then stole
her fur coat and credit cards.
   In a city where there were more than 1,840 homicides last year _
an average of more than five a day _ this one got attention. And it
raised questions, both about security at the hospital and about the
treatment of the mentally ill.
   Smith, who has a history of psychiatric care since 1981,
sometimes stayed at a homeless shelter; sometimes he slept on a cot
hidden in a closet on the 22nd floor of the hospital, a massive,
1,200-bed facility.
   Last summer, he reportedly tried to have himself committed to
Bellevue's emergency psychiatric ward but was referred to a clinic.
   Just last month, Smith was hospitalized for nine days after
telling doctors there he had swallowed rat poison in a suicide
attempt.
   And on Jan. 1, six days before the slaying, a security guard
arrested Smith at the hospital and accused him of stealing a clock
and a hypodermic needle. Smith was charged with a misdemeanor,
allowing him to go free.
   ``It's a rotten system set up by our society,'' Dr. John Pearson,
director of pathology at Bellevue and Hinnant's boss, said after
speaking at a memorial service for her.
   The mentally ill homeless ``are not in and of themselves at
fault,'' he said. ``It's the system that is at fault. They don't
have to be out on the streets, but we have a society that lets that
happen, and that's wrong.''
   Hinnant was working on her own time Saturday, Jan. 7, in a
fourth-floor office, preparing a lecture for her younger colleagues
on Monday.
   She was to meet her husband, Eric Johnson, a piano salesman, that
evening. The couple had married in October; she was five months'
pregnant.
   But sometime Saturday afternoon, Smith, wearing physician's
clothing and a stethoscope, attacked her, police said. He has
contended that a man he identified only as John also participated in
the attack, but police have found no evidence that John exists.
   When Hinnant failed to meet her husband, a worried Johnson called
her office, the police and two hospitals. On Sunday morning, he went
to Bellevue where he and a hospital administrator found his wife's
severely beaten body.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch called it a ``brutal, outrageous murder,''
and police made the case their top priority. A $30,000 reward was
posted. Police got a break when three homeless men went to police
with some of the doctor's belongings they said Smith had given to
them.
   Smith was arrested at a homeless shelter and charged with murder.
   Last year in New York, 65,000 people showed up at city hospitals
asking for psychiatric help. About 16,000 were admitted for
psychiatric care, said Luis Marcos, vice president for mental
hygiene at the city's Health and Hospitals Corp., which oversees
Bellevue and other city hospitals.
   Marcos wouldn't discuss whether Bellevue officials bungled
Smith's case but conceded that overcrowding can affect a physician's
judgment.
   ``I'm not necessarily saying crowdedness interferes with a
diagnosis,'' Marcos said. ``But if you are under pressure, because
you have many patients to be seen in a crowded situation, obviously
your ability to perform an evaluation is going to be affected by
it.''
   ``We try to provide the best care we can with the resources we
have,'' Marcos said.
   Robert Hayes, spokesman for the Coalition for the Homeless,
estimated that New York has 10,000 homeless people who are also
mentally ill.
   ``The real story is that mentally ill people are routinely turned
away from psychiatric hospitals for lack of beds,'' Hayes said.
``That plays a big role in the horrors of street life in New York.
And these horrors are going to continue until there are more
psychiatric beds.''
   Pearson said he hopes something good comes of his colleague's
death.
   ``She was an incredibly bright, happy person, and I'm not just
saying that. Anybody who knew her knows what I'm talking about,'' he
said. ``Maybe something will change because of her.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Official Arrives In Beijing in Secret Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Vietnamese official arrived unannounced in
Beijing on Saturday for what is believed to be the first high-level
talks since 1979 between China and Vietnam on the Cambodian conflict.
   Both sides attempted to keep the visit secret, and officials
refused comment on the arrival.
   China, which arms guerrillas fighting Vietnamese troops in
Cambodia, previously said it would not begin talks unless Vietnam
moves to end its 10-year-old occupation.
   However, foreign reporters peeking through a window at Beijing's
old airport saw Chinese and Vietnamese officials greet a man
resembling Vice Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem.
   The man ducked into a Chinese Foreign Ministry car, which sped
away. The Vietnamese ambassador to China, Nguyen Minh Phuong, came
out the front door of the airport and followed in another car.
   Liem's name was also on the flight log of Air China Flight No.
974, which flew out of Bangkok on Saturday. Japanese journalists
reported seeing Liem at the Bangkok airport.
   The Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier reserved a VIP room at
the Beijing International Airport for a Vietnamese guest but
canceled it on short notice, an airport employee said on condition
of anonymity.
   In a possible attempt to keep the visit secret, Chinese officials
switched the welcoming venue to the old airport, which shares
runways with the newer one.
   Earlier this week, a top Cambodian resistance official said
China, at the request of the Soviet Union, agreed to its first
high-level talks with Vietnam since late 1979.
   The deal also involved the Soviet Union opening direct talks with
Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, said Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, his son and representative in Thailand. He spoke
over resistance radio and the text was obtained Thursday.
   Thai officials also said they knew of the agreement but would
give no details.
   The Vietnamese visit follows negotiations in August between China
and the Soviet Union on the Cambodian conflict, a major stumbling
block for improving long-strained ties between Moscow and Beijing.
   Relations between the two communist giants have been undergoing a
thaw in recent months. Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
will come to China next month to pave the way for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   Ties between China and Vietnam, allies during the Vietnam War,
deteriorated when Vietnam toppled the pro-Chinese Khmer Rouge in
Cambodia in 1978. China and Vietnam fought a border war early the
next year.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia since 1975 in a reign of terror
that left at least 1 million people dead. The group is now one of
three major groups fighting the Vietnam-backed government of
Cambodia.
   China now arms the Khmer Rouge and other rebels there. The United
States backs the two non-communist groups.
   In recent weeks, better Chinese-Vietnam relations began to seem
possible.
   On Jan. 7, China said a Vietnamese proposal to withdraw all its
troops from Cambodia by September was a step forward.
   President Heng Samrin of Cambodia says 50,000 Vietnamese troops
are in Cambodia, but Western intelligence officials and rebels put
the number much higher.
   Vietnam still insists on measures to prevent the Khmer Rouge from
returning to power. However, China has refused to exclude the Khmer
Rouge from a future Cambodian government.

   The government on Saturday acknowledged
that U.S. documents link some West German companies to an alleged
chemical warfare plant in Libya, but said there still was no proof
West German laws were broken.
   West German experts returned home from Washington after examining
U.S. documents on the Libyan plant last week.
   Government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said the U.S. information
``indicates a number of German firms as well as companies from
several nations made deliveries for the Libyan chemical plant,'' but
officials found no evidence to warrant prosecution.
   Washington contends it has proof that the new Libyan plant at
Rabta is a chemical weapons factory. Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi
maintains the plant manufactures pharmaceuticals.
   ``A preliminary evaluation of the documents provided by the
Americans shows that the material is nothing beyond what we already
know about so far and would not stand up in court,'' Ost said in a
statement. He did not identify the firms named in the documents.
   Government officials previously said even with indications of
involvement in the Libyan plant, proof would still be needed that
West German companies broke their country's export laws.
   West German authorities have launched investigations into two
companies that allegedly were involved in the Libyan project:
Imhausen-Chemie of Lahr and the now-defunct I.B.I. Engineering of
Frankfurt.
   Ost said Saturday that after examining confiscated I.B.I. company
documents, authorities have not yet found hard evidence the company
broke any laws.
   West German officials at first cleared the two companies but
later said they ``cannot exclude'' that German companies may have
been involved in the Libyan project.
   Alleged participation by German firms in the Libyan plant has
embarrassed the government and resulted in strained ties with the
United States. When the accusations first came to light through
American newspapers, German leaders complained about a U.S. ``media
campaign'' against their country.
   The news magazine Der Spiegel on Saturday reported that West
German officials began receiving intelligence information about
German complicity in the plant in 1986, and not last fall as
government authorities have maintained.
   The magazine said ``several times the (West German) Federal
Intelligence Service `urgently' and `concretely' pointed to
participation by German firms.
   ``The federal government did not take reports by the German and
American secret services seriously,'' said Spiegel, which did not
identify its sources.
   But Ost said the government followed up on all information
supplied to it by its intelligence forces without delay.
   A leading federal lawmaker for the Free Democrats, junior
partners in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government, on
Saturday called for a parliamentary investigation into the
government's handling of the Libyan chemical plant affair.
   ``The scandal is growing every day' and ``damages the image of
the Federal Republic,'' Hildegart Hamm-Bruecher told Saarlandischer
Rundfunk radio in an interview.
   Der Spiegel also said the magazine has information that West
German engineers are assisting Libya in improving and rebuilding
military aircraft.
   The magazine said the engineers worked for CTTL of Liechtenstein,
a sister company of the Bavarian firm Intec.

   Barbara Bush's press secretary-designate said
Saturday she expects the American people to be ``delighted and
surprised'' by her boss' handling of her role as first lady.
   Anna Maria Perez, whose appointment was announced Saturday by
President-elect Bush's transition team, said her only real
acquaintance with Mrs. Bush was an extensive interview in early
December.
   ``Mrs. Bush is so difficult to categorize or label or typecast, I
think that I along with most of the rest of the American people are
going to be delighted and surprised by what she does with this
position,'' Perez said.
   Perez has been press secretary to Rep. John Miller, R-Wash., for
the past four years and previously worked four years for Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash.
   Perez said she plans to go into her job with ``an open mind and
the expectation that it's going to be an awful lot of hard work, but
that I'm going to really enjoy serving this administration and
working for Mrs. Bush.''
   Mrs. Bush has been interested in promoting literacy, but Perez
said she did not know yet whether the future first lady planned to
choose that or something else as a special project.
   ``We're just going to have to wait and see for a while,'' Perez
said. ``She really wants to be a wife and mother, I think.
   ``Mrs. Bush always puts her husband first, absolutely,'' Perez
said.
   Perez said she has a lot to learn about her job, adding, ``I'm
really going to be looking and learning and listening a lot in the
beginning.''
   ``My knowledge of Mrs. Bush is limited, incredibly limited _
firsthand nowledge,'' Perez said. ``I've read as much as I can about
her.''
   Perez, 37, is a native of New York City, where she attended
Hunter College. She owned a community newspaper in Washington state
before going to work for Gorton in the Senate in 1981.
   Mrs. Bush had said she wanted a black or Hispanic as her press
aide, and Perez is black.
   ``The kind of first lady she's going to be is going to evolve,''
Perez said. ``I'm going to be darn glad to go wherever she leads.''

   A major manufacturer of helicopters said
it is looking into building a commuter helicopter that could carry
up to 100 passengers.
   Officials at Sikorsky Aircraft, based here, said they have been
actively studying the feasibility of such a helicopter, which they
call a VLCT for ``very large civil transport,'' for the past year.
   Such a jumbo helicopter could offer a solution to the problem of
highway traffic jams and airport congestion, Sikorsky officials said.
   ``The effort began in earnest last year as a continuation of
research of the past 20 years,'' said Robert Kelly, director of
commercial marketing, in remarks prepared for release Sunday at a
helicopter trade show in New Orleans.
   ``We are producing military helicopters today that can easily
transport 20,000 pounds at good speeds over long stage lengths,''
Kelly said. ``That could equate to 100 passengers and lots of
reserves, if that should turn out to be the optimum.''
   Using existing technology, such a helicopter could be introduced
by the turn of the century, Kelly said. Sikorsky officials envision
a helicopter that would carry 75 to 100 people on short- to
medium-range trips at about 150 mph.
   Sikorsky said it is does not intend to introduce such a craft
before the year 2000, to allow time for refinements of equipment and
for cities and states to construct suitable heliports.
   Sikorsky noted that the Federal Aviation Administration has
estimated that airport congestion will become a critical problem
nationwide by the year 2000. Similar projections also have been made
for Europe and Japan.
   Sikorsky, primarily a defense contractor, is a leading
manufacturer of military helicopters, including the Black Hawk and
the Seahawk, which are produced for the U.S. Navy and the Royal
Australian Air Force.

   George Bush, getting in a last round of
fishing before becoming president, regaled reporters Saturday with
his account of landing a 13-pound fighting bonefish the day before.
   He said he even got a photograph.
   The fishing ``really is excellent, just wonderful,'' Bush told
reporters watching his party depart from a private dock before 8 a.m.
   Bush caught no bonefish Saturday although he pulled in 25 smaller
fish. He came back after nearly 10 hours on the water saying windy
conditions had hampered the fishing.
   Bush caught seven different types of fish _ ladyfish, snapper,
jack, perch, trout, catfish and a two-foot shark _ and all were
thrown back.
   Perhaps the most interesting catch of the day was by Bush buddy
Fred Zeder, the former ambassador to Micronesia, who snagged a
seagull as he was trying to cast his line. The gull bobbed around
like a kite but soon was reeled in, unsnagged and flew off.
   The president-elect said work, including preparation of his
speech for Friday's inaugural, could wait until he returned to
Washington Sunday.
   However, Bush's transition office in Washington announced several
appointments, including David C. Mulford as under secretary of the
Treasury for international Affairs, and Anna Maria Perez as Barbara
Bush's press secretary.
   When a tourist perched on an adjacent pier told Bush she was from
England, he asked puckishly, ``Think (Prime Minister) Margaret
Thatcher would like a little of this bonefishing action?''
   Bush, fishing off a 17-foot skiff in shallow waters, said he
reeled in a 13-pound bonefish Friday after it stripped off 150 yards
of line. After weighing it, Bush said he threw the fish back in.
   ``We got a picture, word of honor,'' said Bush, producing the
roll of film and instructing an aide to ``release it if it looks
good.''
   The vice president, on his third fishing or hunting trip since
his election, said, ``These are, pound for pound, I'd say, as
fighting a fish as there is in the world.
   ``It really is amazing what they do,'' continued Bush. ``Then you
take them in, weigh them and hold them in the water and stroke them
so that they can escape without some shark getting them. It really
is very wonderful.''
   ``Senator Simpson caught a good-sized redfish ... about 10 or 12
or 13 pounds also,'' said Bush.
   Alan Simpson, the Republican senator from Wyoming, added a few
embellishments.
   ``You can't keep up with him. We had fish all over the place. I
caught a redfish. He caught a bonefish. My redfish was one of the
largest ever caught in these particular waters,'' said Simpson.
   Bush rolled his eyes. ``I didn't point out I have to put up with
this all day long out there,'' he said.
   Bush used an 8-pound test line to reel in his catch Friday, which
he called the ``sporting'' thing to do. ``There's no machine reeling
them in,'' he said.
   This is Bush's fifth trip since 1980 to this resort halfway down
the Keys, but he deflated local boosters' hopes Friday when he said
he will not establish a winter White House here or anyplace else.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was also fishing with Bush,
but no work was on the agenda.
   Asked if he would steal some time to work on the inaugural
speech, Bush said, ``Tomorrow night I start. I've already started,
but not here. When I get back we'll get to seriousness on that.''
   Mulford has been an assistant Treasury secretary since 1984.
Perez is now press secretary to Rep. John Miller, R-Wash.
   Three other Treasury jobs were announced: Edith E. Holiday for
general counsel, Charles H. Dallara, assistant secretary for
international affairs, and Hollis S. McLoughlin, assistant secretary
for policy development. Holiday and Dallara are now Treasury
officials. McLoughlin, a former Purolator Courier Corp. executive,
was Brady's chief of staff as a U.S. senator from New Jersey in 1982.
   The transition office also said Susan Porter Rose will remain
Mrs. Bush's chief of staff, as expected. Another aide, Laurie
Firestone will be the first lady's social secretary and a former
aide, Julie Cooke, her director of projects.
   On Monday, Bush will observe Martin Luther King's birthday by
speaking at a black group's prayer breakfast in Washington, aide
Stephen Hart said.

<HEAD>Textile Workers Threaten Strike Over Pay Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at two textile factories in central
Poland threatened to go on strike Monday if management fails to meet
demands for higher pay, a regional Solidarity leader said Saturday.
   Local Solidarity committees support the wage demands. But the
strike call has upset the Solidarity regional executive committee
that backs union leader Lech Walesa's position that it is now time
to focus on reviving the banned union.
   ``We are not happy with those strikes. It looks like a
provocation or perhaps a safety valve that releases some pressure
from the boiling pot,'' said Ryszard Kostrzewa of the executive
committee for the Lodz region where the factories are located.
   The threat of further strikes comes on the eve of a Communist
Party plenum scheduled to begin Monday.
   A government source insisting on anonymity has said communist
leaders are prepared to offer to legalize Solidarity if the union
agrees to respect a law limiting wildcat strikes, enter into talks
and help the government draft political reforms.
   Walesa said Saturday he could not confirm the report that
communist leaders are preparing to offer to legalize Solidarity, but
he called such recognition ``simply the obvious solution.
   ``The needs of society are so obvious and there are so many
important problems,'' he said.
   Solidarity was outlawed in 1982 following imposition of martial
law in Poland, and has been struggling for legalization ever since.
   In recent months, there have been clear signs of increasing
tolerance of the union and Walesa, with the government hoping to win
the help of the opposition as it attempts to revitalize the economy
and reform the political system.
   Solidarity officials say workers at the Emfor factory in Lodz,
about 82 miles southwest of Warsaw, are demanding a pay raise of 32
cents an hour.
   In nearby Pabianice, workers at the Technical Fabrics Factory
want raises to compensate for losses of up to $10 a month workers
say resulted from new wage regulations introduced in the factory
four months ago, the union said.
   Lodz, the center of Poland's textile industry and one of the
country's most polluted cities, was the scene of reported work
stoppages Wednesday and Thursday when workers at Morfeo factory
outside the city demanded a pay raise of 50 percent.
   Management offered a pay increase of 20 percent Friday, but the
strike did not continue, Kostrzewa said. The workers also called on
management to improve working conditions and legalize Solidarity in
their list of 11 demands.
   In another development, an opposition spokeswoman said police
used batons and dogs Friday to break up a demonstration of about 300
people demanding the legalization of Solidarity in the southwestern
city Walbrzych.
   Maria Pinior, a spokeswoman connected to both Solidarity and the
banned Polish Socialist Party in nearby Wroclaw, said about 50
people were arrested.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two pilots of a Salvadoran airliner were
arrested Saturday for allegedly trying to smuggle eight guns to El
Salvador in their luggage, said a U.S. Customs official.
   The guns were found in suitcases being taken out of a Los Angeles
International Airport terminal by two Taca International Airlines
flight attendants during a 12:30 a.m. search of the flight's
luggage, said Ed Adamson, who heads the local customs office.
   The bags held seven automatic handguns and a 12-gauge
semiautomatic shotgun nicknamed the ``street-sweeper,'' Adamson said.
   The Boeing 737 was detained but the passengers were able to leave
aboard another flight, said Adamson.
   The plane's captain, Francisco Jerez, 30, and the co-pilot,
Francisco Panameno, 29, both of El Salvador, were arrested for
investigation of violating the Neutrality Act and scheduled for
arraignment Tuesday. The act forbids the exportation of firearms
without State Department approval.
   Investigators had not determined for what purpose the guns were
intended, Adamson said.
   The airliner was held at the airport while U.S. authorities
considered whether to seize it. But the airline was cooperating and
did not appear to be connected to the alleged smuggling, said
Adamson.
   ``We're not at liberty to make any comment about it,'' said a man
at Taca's Los Angeles office who did not identify himself and
referred calls to a regional manager in New Orleans. A reservations
agent there said the regional office was closed until Sunday morning.
   The search for the guns was prompted by a tip received by agents
on Friday that the flight crew would attempt to smuggle firearms,
Adamson said.
   Agents conducted an intense search of baggage and people but
could not locate the pilots' bags, he said.
   A short time later an agent spotted two Taca flight attendants
leaving the terminal with bags with the pilots' names on them.
   The flight attendants said they had been instructed by the pilot
to take the suitcases to his hotel, and agents believe they did not
know what they held, Adamson said.

   Dozens of Midwestern skinheads converged here
Saturday for a weekend of meetings, marches and partying, all with
the goal of fighting the racism and violence espoused by rival
skinhead groups.
   ``We want to unite all the anti-racist skinheads,'' said Brandon
Sanford of the Minneapolis Baldies, an intense 18-year-old who has
``SKINHEAD'' tattooed across the back of his shorn head.
   ``We're here to talk about what real skinheads are all about,''
he said. ``We don't want the racist people to use the skinhead image
as a recruiting tool.''
   Youths from Chicago, Milwaukee, Kansas, Nebraska and Ohio, most
in the skinhead uniform of shaved heads, tattoos, boots and flight
jackets, traveled to Minneapolis over the weekend, meeting on street
corners and fast food restaurants in the city's Uptown section.
   The talk was of music, old friendships and their fight against
the racist skinheads in their areas.
   ``We're trying to organize so people know that being a skinhead
is not about hating people,'' said Brian Lauer, a member of Brew
City Skins, a Milwaukee group that formed to counter a group of
racist skinheads in that city.
   Lauer was among some 100 skinheads attending a strategy session
at a local library Saturday. There were plans for a Sunday march
with other groups and a concert featuring local skinhead bands
Sunday night.
   At Saturday's meeting, skinheads from eight cities told of their
``crews,'' or groups, and their fight against white power skinheads
in their area.
   ``There's only one kind of skinhead, and there's bald Nazis,''
said Dave, a skinhead from Des Moines, Iowa.
   The group agreed to form a network to trade information and to
offer assistance to individual groups in various locations who are
fighting racist skinheads, the Ku Klux Klan and Nazis.
   ``We have to work together to make them (the racist skinheads)
disappear,'' said Corky, a black skinhead from Chicago.
   The past year has been filled with headlines of the violent,
racist and anti-Semitic actions of some skinhead groups around the
country.
   An Ethiopian immigrant was killed in November by skinheads
wielding baseball bats in Portland, Ore. Synagogues have been
desecrated in Dallas, Chicago and San Diego. Skinheads were involved
in a televised melee with blacks on the Geraldo Rivera show.
   These skinheads spout a philosophy of white separatism and
fascism. They talk of creating a white nation, wear Nazi swastikas
and complain of a government controlled by ``Zionists.''
   But in many cities they are opposed, often in street brawls, by
other skinheads who say their racist activities are a perversion of
the original philosophies of the skinhead movement, started by
English working class youth who listened to Ska, a racially mixed
music, and whose ranks included blacks.
   ``Being a skinhead means being hard working, being for yourself,
having a pride in your country and pride in yourself. It doesn't
matter what your color is,'' said Eli Simbura, an 18-year-old member
of the Baldies whose cramped apartment served as a rallying place
for the skinheads attending the weekend activities.
   The Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith claims there may be as
many as 2,000 racist skinheads in 21 states, and a check in several
cities shows at least as many anti-racist skinheads. But an accurate
estimate is difficult because skinheads often move from city to city.
   Skinheads pride themselves in being violent in support of their
ideas and their friendships. The Baldies, whose 40 to 50 members
include blacks, Hispanics and Orientals, have warred with the White
Knights, a smaller group of local racist skinheads.
   ``We are violent,'' Simbura said proudly. ``We believe in direct
action.''

   The Democratic loser in November's 4th
District congressional race and a Republican mayoral aide were
nominated Saturday to run in a special election to succeed the man
filling Dan Quayle's Senate seat.
   Republicans took seven ballots to nominate Fort Wayne public
safety director Dan Heath for his party's nomination. Heath, who
also serves an as aide to Mayor Paul Helmke, defeated eight
candidates in voting by GOP precinct committee leaders.
   Democratic Party leaders in the district selected Jill Long, a
former council member in Valparaiso, by acclamation. In 1986, Long
lost the U.S. Senate race to Quayle.
   The 4th District seat, one of Indiana's 10 House seats, has been
vacant since GOP incumbent Dan Coats resigned after then-Gov. Robert
Orr selected him to replace Vice President-elect Quayle as Indiana's
junior senator.
   Coats was sworn in to his Senate seat Jan. 3. Quayle will take
the oath of office with President-elect Bush on Jan. 20.
   The special election is scheduled for March 28.
   The hopefuls for the GOP nomination included three state
representatives: Brad Fox of Rome City, Mitchell V. Harper of Fort
Wayne and Phyllis J. Pond of New Haven. Other active candidates
besides Heath were William Cummings of Fort Wayne, a retired Air
Force officer; Michael Loomis, a Marion County deputy prosecutor;
Jeff Turner, an Auburn lawyer who survived until the final ballot;
and George B. Witwer, co-owner of the Bluffton News-Banner.
   A ninth person, John A. Caldemone of Fort Wayne, declared his
candidacy but did not campaign actively.
   ``I really enjoyed this campaign,'' Heath said after his victory.
   ``We need to get together and make sure we take a united front to
Jill Long,'' he said. ``We are a united party.''
   Long, who unsuccessfully challenged Coats' bid last fall for a
fifth term, was the only announced candidate for the Democratic spot
on the ballot.
   Coats, a former Quayle aide when Quayle held the seat for two
terms in the late 1970s, won the seat in 1980 when Quayle made his
successful bid for the Senate.

   Bombs exploded 45 minutes apart
in Belfast and Londonderry on Saturday night, injuring at least two
soldiers and two civilians, police said.
   In the first attack, a soldier and two civilians were hurt when a
bomb exploded near Dunmisk Park in a residential section of Roman
Catholic west Belfast, a police spokesman said.
   One woman was treated for shock at a hospital and released, and a
man and the soldier were receiving treatment but their injuries also
were not believed to be serious, said the police officer, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The area was cordoned off after the explosion just before 11 p.m.
(6 p.m. EST), which occurred while an army patrol was in the area,
he said. He said earlier police statements that a second device had
been found in the vicinity could not be confirmed.
   The spokesman said one soldier was injured slightly in the bomb
explosion in Londonderry, 65 miles northeast of Belfast, at about
11:45 p.m. in the city's central business district.
   It also exploded when an army patrol had been in the area.
   There were no claims of responsibility for the attacks, but the
army has been targeted by the outlawed Irish Republican Army in its
fight to oust Britain from the province.

   Georgetown University basketball coach John
Thompson walked off the court at game time Saturday night,
protesting a toughened NCAA rule on scholarships, with the help of a
standing ovation from fans.
   Thompson's dramatic gesture came just before the tipoff of
Saturday night's Big East men's basketball game between his
seventh-ranked Hoyas and Boston College.
   As he headed for the dressing room, Thompson did not openly
acknowledge the cheering crowd at Capital Centre. He went to his car
and drove away without speaking to reporters. Assistant coach Mike
Riley took over, and the game continued.
   The move was to protest a new National Collegiate Athletic
Association rule that will impose harsher academic requirements for
incoming freshmen to qualify for athletic scholarships. After being
defeated Tuesday, the proposal passed Wednesday by a 163-154 vote at
the NCAA convention in San Francisco.
   Without being specific, Thompson said Friday that his boycott
would continue ``until I am satisfied that something has been
done.'' He called the new rule ``a tremendous tragedy'' because of
its potential effect on the ability of poor youths to get a college
education.
   Proposal 42, which is to go into effect next year, would prevent
high school students who meet only part of the NCAA's entrance
standards from being eligible for an athletic scholarship their
first year in college.
   It applies to athletes who fail to get both a ``C'' average in 11
key subjects in high school and a minimum score on one of two
standardized college entrance tests: either a 700 out of a possible
1,600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or a 15 out of 36 on the
American College Test. A previous rule allowed those who met either
of the two standards to get a scholarship, though they couldn't play
on a team as freshmen.
   Figures released in 1987 put the nationwide average SAT score at
906 and the average ACT score at 18.7. Critics have charged that the
tests are biased abainst minorities, who tend to score lower than
whites.
   Thompson, who is black, purposely refused to label the proposal
as racist, but did call it ``discriminatory.''
   ``I'm beginning to feel that a kid with a low socio-economic
background has been invited to dinner, had dessert and is now being
asked to leave,'' he said.
   Temple basketball coach John Chaney, one of many college coaches
who expressed support for Thompson, said, ``Instead of considering
some of these proposals, they plan to punish the youngsters, punish
these kids who come from a poor background and have a poor
educational opportunity.''
   But Dave Cawood, NCAA assistant executive director, said in a
statement that those who voted for the rule considered it ``a means
to strengthen the academic entrance requirements for freshmen,'' not
a racial issue.
   Thompson is one of the country's top college basketball coaches.
He was coach of the 1988 U.S. men's basketball team, which won the
bronze medal, and in 1984 his Georgetown team won the NCAA
championship.
   Boston College coach Jim O'Brien applauded Thompson's action,
saying his lofty stature among coaches helps make it a very
effective demonstration.
   ``I don't think that just saying anything gets it done,'' O'Brien
said. ``In his position, by doing what he's doing, he will draw more
attention to it. He feels something needs to be done right now.''

   Dozens of rescuers fought against time and
managed to free 31 gray whales that were beached near the southern
tip of the Baja California peninsula, officials said Saturday.
   Tourists from the United States, Canada and other countries
teamed up with college students, fishermen and Mexican navy
personnel to free the whales late Friday from the Bay of La Paz,
said Blas Castro, an official with the federal Fisheries Department.
   The whales ran aground Friday morning in the knee-deep waters of
the bay ``after a change in the currents caused by winds caused them
to lose their direction,'' Castro said.
   Students from the Center for Biological Studies of Baja
California Sur, joined by the other rescuers ``pulled with their
arms and used small boats to nudge and free the whales,'' said
Daniel Roldan, editor of the La Paz newspaper La Extra.
   ``It was a beautiful thing, a wonderful effort,'' Roldan said.
   ``The whales went back to deeper waters in the Gulf and it
appears they're out of danger,'' Castro said.
   Those that beached themselves Friday measured between 10 and 30
feet long and weighed an average four tons, the Excelsior news
agency reported.
   The gray whales migrate to the same lagoons off Baja California's
Pacific coast each year from their feeding grounds off Alaska. The
lagoons become mammoth nurseries for the gray whales from January to
March each year.

   Scarlet-robed holy men arrived on
magnificent chariots and plunged into the confluence of three rivers
on Saturday, the beginning of a mystical celebration of a rare
planetary alignment.
   Chanting hymns, the first bathers on Saturday offered milk and
flowers as the seven-week holy fair known as ``Kumbh Mela'' began.
Millions are expected to take part.
   ``It is something seen to be believed. It is something nearly
impossible for us to understand,'' said Wade Dazey, an American
tourist who spent $1,500 to come from California to this central
Indian city to see the fair.
   ``You can't see anything similar to this anywhere in the world,
it is worth the money and time,'' said Dazey, a lecturer of
religious studies at the University of California.
   An estimated 30 million to 40 million people are expected to
bathe at the confluence of the Ganga, Jamuna and mythical Saraswati
rivers during the fair, which takes its name from a fight between
gods and demons over a pot of nectar.
   Drops of nectar are believed to have fallen at the confluence,
and Hindus believe a bath at the spot will give them salvation from
what they consider a long cycle of birth and rebirth.
   ``Kumbh'' in Hindi means pot and ``Mela'' means fair.
   The most auspicious time to seek salvation, according to the
Hindu faith, is when Jupiter is in Taurus and the sun and moon are
in Capricorn, a configuration that occurs every 12 years.
   The day did not begin on a auspicious note for a group of 50
pilgrims who fell into the river Ganga when the two boats they were
in capsized. There were no casualties, an official said.
   Holy men dressed in saffron, scarlet, white and gold robes were
given precedence at the bathing site.
   They arrived on magnificent chariots pulled by followers, and on
elephants and camels adorned with feathers, bells, ornaments and
marigold garlands. Brass bands playing popular music marched in
front of the procession as the holy men blessed the throngs of
people waiting to take a dip.
   Some of the holy men wore loincloths and others had only ash
smeared over their bodies. They bathed in temperatures as low as 43
degrees, with their hair either shorn off or tied in knots over
their heads.
   The Nagas, holy men who live as naked recluses, were given even
greater precedence and bathed at dawn.
   The logistics of the holding the fair almost defy comprehension.
   At least 11,000 police officers are constantly on duty to monitor
the 3,000-acre fair area, according to Jagannath Dwivedi, the chief
administrator of the event.
   The police regulate the movements of bathers and attempt to ease
tensions between rival sects of holy men, who have been known to use
their spears and lances against each other.
   ``There is always tension and you never know when a minor clash
will snowball into a battle,'' Dwivedi said.
   Naval divers patrol the river front to prevent pilgrims from
drowning.
   Special attempts are made to keep pilgrims moving steadily to
avoid stampedes, he said. At least 800 pilgrims died at the fair
held in 1954, and 50 were trampled to death in 1986 at a similar
fair in the city of Hardwar, upstream on the Ganges.
   Hardwar and the cities of Ujjain and Nasik are other places in
India where Hindus believe drops of heavenly nectar had fallen, but
the Allahabad fair is considered the best.
   Arrangements to park 200,000 vehicles and 5,000 boats have been
made and authorities have run 400 special trains to bring pilgrims
to the city, Dwivedi said.
   Sprawling canvas tents have been erected to accommodate the
millions of pilgrims who will participate in the fair.
   About 13,000 gallons of milk, 10 tons of butter and 5 tons of
cheese will be supplied to the pilgrims daily. Authorities have
stocked 10,000 tons of wheat, 4,000 tons of rice and 2,000 tons of
sugar for distribution, Dwivedi said.
   Consumption of meat and liquor is banned at pilgrimage centers
during Hindu festivals.

   Anti-abortion demonstrators chained themselves to fences, stopped
traffic and sang hymns as they blocked the entrances of clinics in
three cities Saturday. More than 800 people were arrested, police
said.
   In New York, members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue
continued to defy a federal judge's order to stop blocking clinic
entrances. Police said 690 people were arrested at demonstrations at
six sites.
   Demonstrators chained themselves together to slow police efforts
as long ``as we possibly can to save as many babies as we can,''
said Bob Chuvala, an Operation Rescue spokesman.
   About 72 of the 400 demonstrators blocking the doors of the Delta
Women's Clinic in New Orleans were arrested on charges of
obstructing a public place, police said. In Toronto, about 80 people
were arrested in a demonstration outside the clinic of Dr. Henry
Morgentaler, who led the fight for legalized abortion in Canada.
   As activists geared up for the anniversary next weekend of the
1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, about 300
people braved freezing rain in Cincinnati to attend a rally that did
not involve blocking clinics or being subject to arrest.
   ``Our conviction about human dignity tells us that there is
somethng in every human person tht is sacred, that is inviolable,
that is not ours to dispose of as we see fit,'' Roman Catholic
Archbishop Daniel E. Pilarczyk told the crowd Saturday.
   In the second day of demonstrations in New York, protesters
chanted, lay down, triggered fire alarms and halted elevators, said
InspectorRichard Mayronne, a police spokesman.
   Some 500 to 600 people stopped traffic for more than two hours
while protesting activities of Planned Parenthood's Margaret Sanger
Center, said Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell, a police spokesman. About 225
demonstrators were arrested.
   ``They were lying down and praying in seated positions,''
O'Donnell said. ``Most of the people had to be carried. We would
load some people onto the bus, then other people would run out into
the street and lie in front of the wheels of the bus.''
   About 20 to 30 pro-choice activists demonstrated nearby without
incident, O'Donnell said.
   Later Saturday evening, about 100 pro-choice activists
demonstrated outside St. Patrick's Cathedral, protesting what they
called Cardinal John O'Connor's support for Operation Rescue.
   ``We understand that he is in political, religious and
philosophical agreement with the anti-choice people,'' said Merle
Hoffman, a founder of the New York Pro-Choice Coalition, which
organized the counter-protest and was one of the groups that sought
the judge's order.
   ``But we question whether he approves of their terrorist
tactics,'' she said. ``They are now blatantly defying a federal
order.''
   The second biggest protest occurred at Lincoln's Women Services,
where police said 175 people were arrested _ most of them carried
away on stretchers after they refused to walk.
   Seven people chained themselves together. They used extra-strong
steel locks, ``but we have equipment that cuts through them like
butter,'' said police Inspector Richard Mayronne.
   On Friday, 275 members of the group were arrested in two protests
outside the Sanger clinic, police said.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Ward issued a permanent injunction
against the group on Tuesday, forbidding members to obstruct access
to clinics that perform abortions in New York City.
   The order calls for a fine of $25,000 a day for violations.
   Joan Coombs, deputy executive director of Planned Parenthood,
said the organization planned to seek a contempt charge against
Operation Rescue.
   In New Orleans, protesters sang hymns and carried wooden crosses
while waiting to be arrested for blocking the entrance of an
abortion clinic.
   ``We got here at 6:30 this morning. We shut the place down. No
ladies have had abortions today. Look at the lives we've saved,''
said Anthony Marquize, director of United for Life.
   Terri Bartlett, executive director of Planned Parenthood,
disagreed.
   ``They're not preventing abortions. They're just delaying them
and hurting women who already have had to go through a great deal to
make this decision,'' she said.
   Police cleared a path for about a dozen women, some of whom cried
and covered their faces, and their companions to enter the clinic as
protesters screamed and chanted.

<HEAD>Labor Productivity Boosts Economy But Growth Still Lagging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Increases in labor productivity and a cut in the
number of production workers boosted the Soviet national income by
4.4 percent in 1988, but the economy still fell short of its growth
target, Tass said Saturday.
   In a separate report, the official news agency said Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called for major changes in the farm
sector, but defended the current system of giant collective and
state farms.
   In a report on a meeting Saturday of the Council of Ministers, or
Soviet Cabinet, Tass said officials revealed some 1988 economic
statistics.
   The national income, a measure of economic activity that differs
from gross national product by excluding some indexes, including the
value of some services, increased by 4.4 percent in 1988 and by 3.6
percent for the period of 1986-1988, Tass said.
   ``The growth of national income was assured by an increase in
labor productivity with a reduction in 1987-1988 of the number of
people engaged in material production,'' Tass said.
   However, it said the national income still fell short of the plan
for 1988 by 13.3 billion rubles, or $21 billion. It did not give the
planned figure.
   The ministers sharply criticized the country's inability to
supply the population with enough fruit, vegetables and other
foodstuffs.
   ``No stability in the development of agricultural production and
in the operation of processing branches had been achieved so far,''
Tass reported. ``The population's requirements for many foodstuffs
are not met, big purchases of food abroad have to be made.''
   The cost of those purchases for the last three years was $48
billion, it said.
   Gorbachev said a long-awaited plenary meeting of the Communist
Party Central Committee on agriculture will take place in March.
   The Soviet president is pushing to increase farmers' interest in
their work by organizing them on the basis of smaller groups and
giving them more responsibility and a chance to earn more money for
harder work.
   But in remarks Friday to agricultural specialists, Gorbachev
defended the giant collective and state farms that were organized
during Stalinist times. The remarks were carried Saturday by Tass.
   ``Those who do not trust the collective and state farms ... have
simply failed to think everything over to the end and failed to sort
things out,'' Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   ``It is precisely now that our big collective and state farms
will be able to work in the right way and in the interests of rural
workers, and it means, for the benefit of the country because we
reveal their potential in boosting the output of products.''

   More than 300 pounds of a powerful plastic
explosive that had been stolen from a mine was seized in a raid by
agents who posed as would-be buyers for the material, authorities
said.
   Five people were arrested in the raid on a motel Friday night
where agents had rented rooms to arrange the bogus purchase,
authorities said.
   There was enough explosive, known as C-3 or Tovex, to blow up a
three-block area, said police in this community of 50,000 about 45
miles north of Denver.
   Following the arrests, authorities went to the Fort Collins home
of one of the suspects, where they seized armor-piercing rifle
rounds, thousands of rounds of ammunition, an AK-47 rifle,
hollow-point revolver rounds and homemade bullets designed to pierce
bullet-proof vests worn by police, police said.
   Agents also confiscated a number of handguns; switchblade knives;
military flak jackets; a scope-mounted AR-15, described as a
civilian version of the military M-16 rifle; 2,000 blasting caps;
and a large amount of detonation cord.
   Books and magazines about terrorism and survival tactics also
were found, said Longmont police Sgt. Carl McIntyre.
   FBI spokesman Dick Schussler refused to comment Saturday on the
group's possible motive.
   Boulder County Sheriff's Sgt. George Dunphy said there had been
no hint from any of the investigators that suspected terrorists were
involved. Dunphy said the investigation had been suspended for the
weekend and the five suspects remained in the county jail.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which
participated in the monthlong undercover investigation along with
the sheriff's department, is in charge of the case, Dunphy said. ATF
agents could not be reached for comment Saturday.
   ``We're real pleased with how this thing went down,'' Sheriff
Brad Leach said.
   He identified those arrested for investigation of possession and
sale of explosives as: Jon Alexander Kobert, 29, Richard Sanford
Baxter, 51, and Andrew Wallace Ferguson, 29, all of Fort Collins;
Jeffery Bart Rudolph, 29, of Akron, Colo.; and Evelyn Jean
Moschetti, 18, of Laporte.
   It was at Rudolph's rented home in Fort Collins that officers
found the cache of weapons and ammunition.
   Authorities stalked out the motel after an undercover agent
completed a deal to buy more than 300 pounds of the powerful
explosive for $10,000 cash. The explosives were stolen from a mine
in Left Hand Canyon northwest of Boulder in September, Leach said.
   ``This is a lot of explosives to be floating around,'' Leach
said. ``To get over 300-plus pounds of this stuff off the street is
a good thing.''
   Leach said the investigation began when local and federal
authorities received information about suspects in the mine theft.
Negotiations were conducted with Kobert to buy large amounts of
explosives, complete with blasting caps and detonation cord.
   All five suspects were being held in Boulder County Jail.

<TEXT>
   The government on Saturday offered one of
its major hotels, the Baghdad Sheraton, for sale to the private
sector.
   State-run newspapers carried an advertisement offering the
307-room hotel to a private company with at least $150 million in
capital. The hotel is wholly owned by the government and run by the
international Sheraton chain.
   The ruling Revolutionary Command Council in September abolished
the state tourism authority and decided to sell all of its assets,
including five major hotels in Baghdad.
   The move to sell tourist facilities is a part of President Saddam
Hussein's drive to develop the private sector in what has been a
staunch socialist economy.
   Selling state assets is seen as a means of overcoming massive
government debts and stimulating the economy battered by the
8-year-old war with Iran that ended with a cease-fire in August.
   The Sheraton chain runs another hotel in Iraq's southern port of
Basra that was badly damaged by Iranian shelling.
   Sheraton officials said they have no idea whether it was also up
for sale, but they confirmed the government has announced it would
be on the market soon.

<HEAD>Soviets Plan Huge Telescope, Joint Laboratory With American Company</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union plans to put a huge
telescope in orbit and to set up a biotechnology laboratory with an
American chemical company, Soviet scientists said Saturday.
   Vadim T. Ivanov, director of the Shemiakin Institute for
Bioorganic Chemistry, said he plans to sign an agreement with the
Monsanto Co., in St. Louis, to establish a biotechnology laboratory
in the Soviet Union.
   Ivanov is a member of a delegation of high-ranking Soviet
researchers attending the annual meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
   Research at the biotechnology laboratory would focus on nervous
system biology, growth hormones to boost livestock production and
help underdeveloped humans, and genetic engineering to make crops
resist pests, salt and drought, Ivanov said.
   Soviet scientists also hope to place an optical telescope with a
10-meter mirror in orbit by about the year 2000, although the
proposal doesn't yet have government approval, said Nikolay S.
Kardashev, deputy director of the Soviet Institute for Space
Research.
   The Soviet telescope would be far larger than the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope, which the United States plans to launch from
a space shuttle in February 1990. It has a mirror diameter of 2.4
meters, or about 94.5 inches.
   Kardashev also said that despite some earlier problems, his
country's Phobos 2 space probe, launched last year toward an
encounter with the Martian moon Phobos, seems to be working well as
it heads toward the red planet.
   ``We hope it's OK _ no problems,'' he said. The Soviets earlier
lost all contact with a similar probe, Phobos 1.
   This is the second year a Soviet delegation has visited the
annual meeting of the AAAS, which publishes the journal Science and
bills itself as the leading general scientific group in the United
States. Some 10,000 scientists are expected at the meeting, which
concludes Thursday.
   The Soviet scientists cited numerous examples of U.S.-Soviet
scientific cooperation in each of their fields, and expressed hope
for more.
   ``It's very good improving international cooperation,'' Kardashev
said.
   Soviet scientists also want to boost cooperation with U.S.
earthquake experts, especially in fault-ridden California, following
the devastating quake in Armenia, said Konstantin Frolov, who headed
the Soviet delegation.
   Frolov, vice president of the USSR Academy of Science, also said
it was unlikely the death toll from the earthquake exceeded 30,000.
   ``Nobody knows now absolutely perfectly how many'' died in the
Dec. 7 earthquake, but ``25,000 or 30,000 may be so,'' Frolov said.
   For weeks after the 6.9-magnitude quake in northwest Armenia,
Soviet officials estimated the death toll at 55,000. Late last month
they downgraded it to about 25,000 after nearly that many bodies
were recovered from collapsed buildings.
   However, American engineers returning from an Armenia visit said
Jan. 4 said thousands of bodies never will be found and said they
thought probably 60,000 died during the quake.
   ``Sixty-thousand _ this is too much,' Frolov said.
   Frolov, often speaking through an interpreter, called the
Armenian quakes ``a very sad and difficult situation,'' and said the
Soviets want to learn how to speed post-disaster rescue and relief
efforts, protect against earthquake damage, better predict temblors,
and improve building methods.
   Ivanov, citing the Soviets' interest in cooperative biotechnology
research, said the joint Soviet-Monsanto lab would be located at his
institute and that Monsanto would help equip it. Members of both
organizations would be on a board overseeing the lab, he added.
   Details haven't been worked out about how profits would be shared
from any products developed at the lab, but ``patents should be
joint patents,'' he added.

   A barge slammed into a concrete pillar
supporting the center of the three-mile Pensacola Bay Bridge on
Saturday, knocking the pillar into the water and halting vehicle and
marine traffic, officials said.
   The four-lane bridge was clear of traffic at the time and no
injuries were reported.
   The bridge is the only direct link between Pensacola and suburban
Gulf Breeze and is used daily by thousands of commuters. The only
other land access is a detour of about 60 miles.
   The bridge will remain closed to all boat and vehicular traffic
for three weeks while the southbound lanes are stabilized, said Paul
Hazucha, regional maintenance engineer for the Florida Department of
Transportation.
   Two-lane traffic then will be permitted in the northbound lanes
while permanent repairs are made, which will take from four to six
months, Hazucha said.
   Construction workers building an emergency lane on the bridge
``saw the situation coming and cleared the site so there were no
cars actually traveling over that spot,'' said Gulf Breeze City
Manager Jack Tuttle. ``Fortunately, obviously, there were no
vehicles that went into the water.''
   Officials said it was not immediately known why the barge was
unable to navigate away from the pillar.
   Junius Boling, of Mary Esther, said he was fishing on the end of
the Gulf Breeze pier next to the bridge Saturday morning when the
barge hit about 100 feet away.
   ``I just stood here and watched him take out the end of the
bridge,'' Boling said. ``They scared the fish away.''
   Initial reports indicated the southbound side of the U.S. 98
bridge was sagging about five feet, said Coast Guard Lt. Mark Kasper
in New Orleans.
   A 32-foot Coast Guard patrol boat was on the scene, and a bridge
inspection team from the state Department of Transportation was
assigned to assess the damage, he said.
   The barge was operated by Hollywood Marine Co. of Houston and was
empty of cargo at the time, officials said.
   The bridge is part of the main coastal highway in the Florida
Panhandle. It has been undergoing a multimillion-dollar expansion to
add emergency lanes on each side.

   Afghanistan said Saturday that it attacked two
intruding Pakistani helicopters and an armored column that committed
an ``unprecedented act of aggression,'' the official Soviet news
agency Tass reported.
   Tass quoted official Afghan news agency Bakhtar as saying the
helicopters were carrying ``leaders of extremist organizations,
foreign military advisers and high-ranking Pakistani officers to the
area'' when they landed at a farm in Nangarhar province on Monday.
   Soviet and Afghan media often refer to the U.S.-backed,
anti-government guerrillas as ``extremists.''
   Tass said the Pakistani mechanized column reached the same area
on the same day, ``bringing armed people, arms and ammunition.'' The
Soviet-backed Afghan military attacked, damaging or destroying the
two helicopters and some armored cars, it said.
   The report, quoting the Afghan military command, did not give any
casualty figures. There was no immediate word from the Pakistani
government or Afghan guerrillas based in Pakistan.
   ``The Pakistani armed forces committed an unprecedented action of
aggression against the republics of Afghanistan,'' Tass quoted the
Afghan military command as saying.
   ``Islamabad's actions not only flagrantly violate the letter and
spirit of the Geneva agreements, but also enter into direct
contradiction with the universally recognized norms of international
relations,'' it said. Afghanistan made a formal protest to Pakistani
diplomats in Kabul.
   Anti-Marxist resistance fighters who oppose Kabul's pro-Soviet
government operate out of bases inside Pakistan and near the border.
   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union repeatedly have accused the
United States and Pakistan of violating the April 14 Geneva
agreement by continuing to supply the resistance with weapons.
   Under the agreement, the Soviet Union is to withdraw its 100,000
soldiers from Afghanistan by Feb. 15. Half of the soldiers were
withdrawn between May 15 and Aug. 15, but Soviet diplomats have said
they might not meet the final deadline because of continued
interference by Pakistan and the United States.
   In another development, guerrilla leader Sibghatullah Mojaddidi
said his alliance plans to announce a provisional government within
a month, the Saudi Arabian newspaper Okaz reported Saturday.
   Mojaddidi, spokesman for a coalition of seven Pakistan-based
Afghan guerrilla groups, said in an interview with Okaz that his
group would not object to the return of Afghanistan's deposed king,
Zahir Shah.
   The former monarch has lived in Italy since his overthrow in 1973.
   The guerrillas are demanding power be turned over to them
exclusively after the Soviet Union withdraws its remaining troops.
   But the Soviet Union, which sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979
in support of a Marxist regime, insists President Najib's government
should stay on after the military withdrawal.

   The artistic and musical director of the new Opera
of the Bastille has been fired in a dispute over duties and salary,
and a stage director said Saturday he will refuse to direct the
opera's debut presentation.
   Daniel Barenboim, a conductor and concert pianist, was ousted
Friday after contending an agreement he signed with the former
conservative government of Jacques Chirac guaranteed his position
and a salary of more than $1 million.
   But Pierre Berge, president of the Association of Theaters of the
Paris Opera, told a news conference Friday the accord was signed
``in haste'' and was not valid.
   The May 5 accord said Barenboim should receive a salary of
between $1.1 million and $1.2 million. Berge, appointed in August,
offered Barenboim a $570,000 salary as musical director.
   Barenboim told Europe 1 radio he considered the development a
``breach of contract'' and threatened to sue.
   Berge said allowing Barenboim to be artistic and musical director
was giving him too much power.
   ``It is a little bizarre and that doesn't exist in practically
any country of the world,'' Berge said.
   Several artistic personalities, including stage director Patrice
Chereau, composer Pierre Boulez and singer Jessy Norman, signed a
message to President Francois Mitterrand and Minister of Culture
Jack Lang, saying they would not be involved in the programs
Barenboim planned unless his duties were restored.
   Barenboim's firing may throw in to question the opening date of
the Bastille Opera, set for early next year.
   On Saturday, Chereau said on FR3 television that he will not
direct the first show at the Bastille Opera because of Barenboim's
firing.

   An angry crowd hurled rocks at Ku Klux Klan

   ``There was a large group participating and a large group
watching, despite a downpour,'' said police Lt. Bob Barnes said.
``Some of the crowd got to throwing rocks at the march.''
   There were about 400 Klan members marching and about as many

Barnes said.
   The march had progressed only a short distance when the rock
throwing began, Barnes said, but the violence did not last long.
   The march is the fourth staged by the Klan in Pulaski since
King's birthday was declared a national holiday.The civil rights
leader was killed in April 1968 in Memphis by James Earl Ray, who is
serving a life sentence in Brushy Mountain prison in east Tennessee.
   Pulaski, 80 miles south of Nashville near the Alabama border, is
where the Klan was created after the Civil War.

   A labor chief famed for his Las Vegas gambling
exploits faces an inquiry into the source of his wealth as part of
the crackdown on the leadership of the Oil Workers Union, government
sources said Saturday.
   Former Sen. Salvador Barragan Camacho already has been charged
with possession of illegal weapons. Barragan Camacho, the union's
secretary-general until last week, declared his innocence on the
weapons charges early Saturday from a bed at the Cardiological
Hospital.
   He checked into the hospital complaining of heart trouble last
week after federal officials raided the fortress-like home of his
mentor and the union's top leader, Joaquin Hernandez Galicia.
   Authorities also raided Barragan Camacho's home in Mexico City,
confiscating several high-caliber weapons, ammunition and silencers.
   A search of his $75,000, bulletproof limousine turned up more
than $1 million in jewelry, cash and bars of silver. The jewelry
included a gold bracelet that authorities said weighed almost half a
pound and several gold medals from gambling tournaments.
   The Excelsior news service said Barragan Camacho declared assets
of less than $100,000 six years ago when he began his recently
completed term in the senate.
   Barragan Camacho was the last of the 51 suspects to enter a plea
in the crackdown on the Oil Workers Union.
   Administrative judge Jose Luis Garcia on Saturday ruled that 28
of those arrested on arms charges were eligible to post bail. No top
union leaders or La Quina associates were included in the ruling.
   Government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
indicated more arrests are expected. The sources also said there
will be an investigation into Barragan Camacho's ``unexplained
riches.''
   The former senator was an enthusiastic patron of Las Vegas
casinos. He once reportedly gambled away more than $1 million in a
matter of minutes.
   His extravagance at the gaming tables was documented in books and
articles several years ago by the late journalist Manuel Buendia.
   The union crackdown began Tuesday with a spectacular raid by
police and soldiers on Hernandez Galicia's home in Ciudad Madero on
the Gulf Coast. A federal agent died in the shootout.
   Hernandez Galicia and other union officials face a variety of
charges, including illegal arms possession, murder and tax evasion.
   Judicial officials said Saturday that Barragan Camacho's
condition is stable and they expect him to join Hernandez Galicia
and other union leaders in prison next week.

<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush says she's finding that many older
women are ``tickled pink'' at her personal style of avoiding makeup,
hair color and dieting.
   Mrs. Bush, who describes herself as a ``full-figured woman,''
said she hasn't been trying to lose weight lately and doesn't plan
to accept borrowed gowns from high-fashion designers as Nancy Reagan
did.
   In an interview with several news organizations, she said she's
getting a good response from the public.
   ``My mail tells me a lot of fat, white-haired, wrinkled ladies
are tickled pink,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``They're very sweet. I think it
makes them feel better about themselves. I mean, look at me _ if I
can be a success, so can they.''
   Mrs. Bush said she feels no guilt about the $25 million being
spent on this week's inaugural activities because the money is being
privately raised, except for funds appropriated by Congress for the
ceremonial portion.
   ``These people are raising it (money for the inaugural) because
they worked for years and years to elect a president,'' she said.
``I don't feel badly about it at all. It's putting a lot of people
to work, giving a lot of people jobs.''

<HEAD>40-Year Prison Term for Mexican Drug Smuggler</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former farm worker was sentenced to 40
years in prison by a judge who called him ``the general, admiral,
chief'' of a multimillion-dollar heroin and cocaine ring.
   Andres Carrasco Aragon, 34, a Mexican national who lived in
Tacoma at the time of his arrest last year, was sentenced Friday by
U.S. District Judge Jack Tanner. The sentence was the second-longest
prison term in a federal drug case in the state.
   Leonel Cortez-Vaca, 40, of Spanaway, and Maximino Tapia-Caballos,
31, of Woodbrook, also were sentenced by Tanner to four years in
prison for their part in the drug conspiracy.
   They were among 17 people, besides Carrasco, who have pleaded
guilty or been convicted of drug-related offenses in the case.
   Carrasco's wife, Rosanna Carrasco, was sentenced to six months in
jail for taking telephone messages for him in the smuggling
operation. His brother is one of two defendants who remain fugitives
in the case.
   ``You were the general, admiral, chief _ at least in this area,''
Tanner said. Carrasco was named in 42 counts of a 130-count federal
indictment, including a charge of running a continuing criminal
enterprise.
   Four days into his trial in November, he pleaded guilty to
reduced charges in exchange for a promise by government lawyers not
to recommend more than 40 years in prison.
   The charges he pleaded guilty to included possession with intent
to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin, possession with intent
to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine, conspiracy to
distribute heroin and conspiracy to distribute cocaine.
   The law allows no parole, and even with good behavior he must
serve at least 34 years behind bars.
   Carrasco was described as a hard worker in the tomato and pepper
fields of an impoverished area of Mexico as a boy and later in the
apple orchards of north-central Washington and the tree farms around
Raymond.
   Assistant U.S. attorney Jerry Diskin said Carrasco began his drug
ring in December 1986 and expanded it until last May, when he and
the others were arrested by federal agents after a nine-month
investigation.

   Calendars given to managers of 65
McDonald's restaurants mark the state holiday for Martin Luther King
Jr. as ``National Nothing Day'' because of what an advertising
agency calls its embarrassing but innocent mistake.
   The civil rights leader, who was shot to death in Memphis in
April 1968, was born Jan. 15, 1929, but his birthday is being
observed by Tennessee and most states on the third Monday in
January, which this year is Jan. 16.
   John Malmo Advertising denoted that day ``National Nothing Day''
on calendars given to managers of Memphis-area McDonald's
restaurants to remind them when sales promotions start and end.
   ``It certainly was not done intentionally or maliciously,'' said
Cathleen West of Malmo in the wake of angry comments by black
residents of Memphis. ``It was a terrible clerical oversight.''
   ``It was unfortunately a terrible, terrible oversight,'' said Ms.
West, who handles McDonald's account with Malmo. ``It's not
McDonald's fault.''
   The error was not noticed until an annoyed McDonald's employee
called to complain.
   The National Nothing Day holiday has been listed on the calendar
in past years too, she said, as a spoof of special days that salute
everything from pickles to world poetry.
   New calendars were mailed to the restaurants this week, the
agency said.
   Steve Lykins, vice president of Century Management, which owns
two dozen McDonald's restaurants in the region, said that the day
before the mistake was discovered, the company saluted 10 black high
school students as ``McDonald's Talented Teens: Black History Makers
of Tomorrow,'' handing out plaques and $200 awards at a banquet
featuring black community leaders.

   An 8-year-old girl, whose older brother
was on trial for murder, was barred from a courtroom and surrounding
halls after she pretended to shoot the murder victim's daughter.
   ``I'm not going to tolerate such conduct in a trial like this,''
Superior Judge Bryant Huff said in barring the child from the
Gwinnett County courtroom Thursday.
   The incident occurred during the trial of Aakeem Tahli Woodard
and Dana Robert Thompson. They are accused of killing Betty Sue
Bowman, a convenience store clerk, in Tucker in June.
   Ms. Bowman's daughter, Mary Ann Pack, told Huff that before trial
began Thursday, Woodard's youngest sister pointed her finger at Ms.
Pack and said, ``Pow.''
   Huff summoned the family before the bench for questioning. The
child was then escorted from the courtroom.

<TEXT>
   The Defense Department, which said goodbye to
President Reagan this week with an elaborate review ceremony, has
scheduled two other farewells next week for its top civilian leaders.
   Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci will be honored Jan. 17
during a ceremony inside the Pentagon hosted by Adm. William J.
Crowe, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon said.
   And Deputy Defense Secretary William H. Taft IV will be honored
the same day inside the Ceremonial Hall of Fort Myer, Va., next to
Arlington National Cemetery.
   Unlike the farewell for Reagan, which was staged at Andrews Air
Force Base, Md., and included 1,400 guests and dignitaries, the
ceremonies for Carlucci and Taft will be small and low-key.
   Indeed, the Pentagon said reporters probably would have to select
only a few representatives to cover the goodbye to Carlucci because
it will be held in a small alcove of the Pentagon dedicated to
recipients of the Medal of Honor.

   A police officer suspended for allegedly

other tires over the last 15 months, police said.
   Officer Richard Lake, 44, was arrested Thursday and charged with
criminal mishchief after he was identified by a man whose tires he
had slashed. After the arrest, police reopened their investigation
into tire slashings reported by Lake's ex-girlfriend and the woman's
auto mechanic, police said.
   Deborah Childs charged that whenever she and Lake had a fight
during their on-again, off-again relationship, her car tires were
slashed.
   ``I've had to buy over 60 tires,'' she said.
   In addition, Ms. Childs charged that Lake once slashed 24 tires
at a car dealership owned by her mechanic after Lake erroneously
accused her of having an affair with the man.
   Lake was released on his own recognizance. The 18-year police
veteran was suspended Thursday from his job after he allegedly was
seen by Charles Brooks slashing the tires of a car owned by Brooks.

   An 85-year-old woman who beat her
older sister to death with a mop received three years probation
Friday and was ordered to remain at her retirement home under
virtual house arrest.
   Edna Lamont was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the
March 12 bludgeoning death of Mary McBride, 86.
   Ms. Lamont told authorities the victim suffered from Alzheimer's
disease, a degenerative ailment that robs the elderly of their
mental faculties.
   Deputy District Attorney T.K. Herman called the sentence
appropriate.
   ``There was strong evidence that (Lamont) was suffering from the
same kind of mental dementia that the deceased suffered,'' Herman
said.
   Ms. Lamont wasn't present at her sentencing because of
deteriorating health, he said, adding that she had blocked the
slaying from her mind.
   Superior Court Judge Robert Thomas convicted Ms. Lamont of
involuntary manslaughter, based on preliminary hearing transcripts,
after a Municipal Court judge changed a murder charge to the lesser
offense.
   Ms. Lamont was ordered not to leave her retirement home without a
judge's approval, and only then when supervised by a probation
officer.

   Rural interstate highway accidents killed 352
more people than a year earlier in states where the speed limit was
raised to 65 mph, while death tolls on other roads decreased
slightly, according to a government report.
   The 19 percent increase in deaths occurred over a period that
varied for each state, depending on when drivers were allowed to go
faster, said the report Friday by the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration. Congress authorized the increased limit
beginning April 2, 1987, and 38 states have adopted it for their
rural interstates.
   Highway deaths in those states on urban interstates and other
roads where the 55 mph limit remained totaled 21,366 for the same
period in 1986 and 21,231 in 1987, the report said. Fatalities in
states that raised the speed limit increased by an average nearly
three times as high as in 10 states that kept the limit at 55 on all
roads, the report showed.

   George Washington trembled as he delivered his
first inaugural address.
   Abraham Lincoln was thrown off his stride by a spectator falling
from a tree.
   Harry Truman was 29 minutes late taking the oath of office.
   Now it's George Bush's turn.
   From the 13-star flags to the metal detectors, everything is just
about ready for Friday's repetition of the ceremony Franklin D.
Roosevelt called ``a day of national consecration.''
   The inauguration of an American president has, in its 200-year
history, been marked by eloquent prose, adorned by poetry, buried
under a blizzard, pelted with rain and on two occasions visited by
such harsh weather that participants had to move indoors.
   It has seen reunions of Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders, of the
battery that Cpl. Truman led in World War I and of the P-T boat crew
that John F. Kennedy commanded in the Pacific.
   The metal detectors are a new touch in keeping with the
terrorist-conscious Washington of 1989, but security is nothing new
to inaugurals.
   When Lincoln took the oath in 1861, ``two riflemen lurked at each
window of the Capitol wings flanking the inaugural stand, watching
for any interference,'' wrote biographer Carl Sandburg.
   When Franklin D. Roosevelt assumed office in the depth of the
Depression in 1933, there were machine guns at the Capitol.
   Both Lincoln and Roosevelt were in the stovepipe hat era of
inaugural dress, which prevailed until 1952, when Dwight Eisenhower
opted for homburgs. Kennedy returned to the high silk hat tradition,
but more recent presidents have usually worn business suits.
President Reagan wore morning clothes, with striped pants and tails,
for his first inaugural in 1981.
   The weather also has varied. It rained on FDR's inaugurals in
1933 and 1937, as well as on Lincoln's second one in 1865.
   In 1909, Washington was in the grip of a blizzard, so William
Howard Taft took the oath in the Senate Chamber instead of outside
as usual.
   In 1961, it was 28 degrees at noon, but the ceremonies went on at
the East Front of the Capitol as scheduled. That was when poet
Robert Frost, blinded by the sunlight reflected from fallen snow,
was unable to read the especially written poem he had brought with
him, and summoned up from memory an old one, ``The Gift Outright'' _
``Such as we were, we gave ourselves outright ... To the land
vaguely realizing westward ...''
   In 1985, with the temperatures in the dangerously cold range,
Reagan canceled all outdoor activities for his second inaugural.
   The New York City Commission on the Bicentennial of the
Constitution, which is also observing the bicentennial of
Washington's first inauguration, says the best account of it was
given by an observer named Willam Maclay. According to Maclay, the
father of his country ``trembled, and several times could scarce
make out to read'' as he delivered his address to a joint session of
Congress at Federal Hall in New York.
   By Washington's second inauguration, after the capital had moved
to Philadelphia, he was advised by his Cabinet to hold a simple
ceremony in the Senate chamber and travel to it ``without form,
attended by such gentlemen as he choose.'' He chose to ride alone,
in his carriage.
   At Lincoln's inauguration in 1861, according to an observer
quoted in Sandburg's biography, ``at one point in his speech, Mr.
Lincoln was thrown completely off his balance for a moment by a
crash not far in front of him, followed by something which for an
instant looked like a struggle ... a spectator falling out of a
tree.''
   As for Truman, he wrote in his memoirs that the pre-inauguration
gathering in the Capitol Rotunda took so long that the Marine Band
didn't strike up ``Hail to the Chief'' until 12:14 p.m., and it
wasn't until 12:29 that he actually took the oath.
   It didn't matter. He had been president since noon anyway. The
Constitution provides that the old president's term ends and the new
president's term begins then, not with the speaking of the oath.

<HEAD>New Twists in Insider Trading Scandal, Stay Tuned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor quit for a possible mayoral bid,
his aides botched the first key case to reach trial, and the biggest
corporate target of their fraud probe offered a top job to a former
government adversary.
   No, it wasn't the latest episode of ``L.A. Law.'' But the twists
in the Wall Street insider trading scandal this past week could well
provide some real-life fodder for Hollywood writers of the glitzy
television series.
   It began last Tuesday when politically ambitious Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, architect of a massive
securities-fraud crackdown over the past few years, announced he was
resigning at the end of the month.
   Although Giuliani's departure was expected _ because of numerous
dropped hints he might run for New York mayor _ it came at a
particularly crucial time in the Wall Street investigation for which
he is largely responsible.
   Giuliani will be leaving more than a half-dozen important cases
unresolved, along with increasing acrimony over what defense lawyers
call his brutal and sometimes careless tactics.
   Coincidentally, those tactics backfired on his assistants just as
Giuliani was calling the press together at his downtown Manhattan
office to say farewell.
   Next door in federal court, a judge decreed a mistrial in the
stock-manipulation case against GAF Corp. and a senior company
official, the first key prosecution to reach the trial phase in the
scandal.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe said prosecutors broke the
rules by failing to inform the defense that a key piece of evidence
they introduced may have been altered.
   A federal appeals court sided with her in ordering a new trial,
but warned the Giuliani aide handling the case: ``Don't withhold any
more evidence.''
   The departure of Giuliani also signaled his evident failure to
extract a plea bargain agreement from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
high-yield bond financier, Michael Milken, who has continued to
assert his innocence although his employer capitulated last month.
   Drexel, the biggest corporate target of Giuliani's crusade,
agreed Dec. 21 to plead guilty to six unspecified felonies, pay a
record $650 million in fines and restitution, settle related
litigation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and cooperate
in the government's expanding fraud probes.
   As part of a move to cleanse its sullied image, the firm
announced last Thursday it had offered the chairman's job to John
Shad, the former SEC chief who authorized the investigation that
ensnared Drexel in the first place.
   It wasn't clear by the end of the week whether the offer would be
accepted by Shad, who is now U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands. But
he was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as saying any decision was
subject to ``favorable resolution'' of Drexel's legal problems.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _Government statistics suggested sharp rises in consumer
spending, debt and inflation. The Federal Reserve said consumer
borrowing swelled at an 8.2 percent annual rate in November, driven
by credit-card purchases; the Commerce Department said retail
spending shot up 6.7 percent last year, the fastest growth in four
years; and the Labor Department said wholesale prices rose 4 percent
last year, the highest rate since the early 1980s.
   _Although the stock market appeared to be holding its own, the
post-crash uncertainty of the securities world was dramatically
demonstrated by sharply different earnings situations at two of Wall
Street's biggest firms. Bear Stearns Cos. reported the highest
quarterly profits in history, while Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said
it would suffer a quarterly loss, partly because of the tumbling
value of its holdings in a troubled Texas bank, MCorp.
   _President-elect Bush suggested he might propose tax changes that
would make debt-financed takeovers less attractive, but there was no
evident slowdown in the merger news that colored 1988. Cooke
Cablevision Inc. and the New York Times Co. agreed to sell their
cable TV operations in transactions totaling almost $2 billion; and
West Point-Pepperell Inc. reported sharply lower profits partly
because of efforts to fight a $1.4 billion hostile takeover bid.
   _Meanwhile on the cooked and and raw poultry fronts, a judge
ruled Popeye's Famous Fried Chicken may resume a $290 million
takeover attempt of rival Church's Fried Chicken; and Holly Farms
Corp. set Wednesday as the deadline for suitors Tyson Foods Inc. and
ConAgra Inc. to submit new offers in a $1 billion bidding struggle.

<TEXT>
   Throughout the country, aging bridges crack or
sway as traffic clogs pot-hole-ridden roads and highways. Public
dams and sewers cry out for more than a good plumbing job.
   Then there's the problem of trashing our trash...
   As the nation's infrastructure and public works systems show
increasing signs of deterioration, many public officials are
expected to turn more and more to bonds. At least that's what
experts predicted this past week at a forum by Municipal Bond
Investors Assurance Corp., a leading insurer of municipal bonds.
   ``There's no way of escaping those needs. You've got to get to
work,'' said forum participant Austin V. Koenen, managing director
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``I'm very bullish on volume.''
   An MBIA survey of municipal bond professionals predicted that
volume of tax-exempt municipal bonds _ most often used to finance
infrastructure and other public projects _ will rise 7 percent in
1989 to a record level $120 billion.
   Volume for the taxable municipal market should reach $2.8 billion
this year, compared with an estimated $2.2 billion in 1988, it said.
   The survey suggested the biggest increase would come in bond
issues for transportation, estimating a 61 percent rise in volume
over last year to $14.08 billion. However, the biggest chunk of
newly issued bonds, an estimated $30.04 billion this year vs. $28.38
billion in 1988, will be used to refund old debt, the survey said.
   It predicted a 58 percent rise for gas and electric to $12.14
billion; a 48 percent rise for water and sewer projects to $12.67
billion; a 35 percent rise for hospitals to $14.94 billion; a 26
percent rise for education to $20.31 billion; and just a fractional
rise in housing to $13.96 billion.
   In last year's general election alone voters nationwide approved
a record $13.8 billion in state and local bond issues to finance
projects ranging from road and bridge repairs to new prison
facilities.
   Experts say the anticipated increase in bond volume is largely
due to a steady reduction of federal assistance and the historical
neglect of public works projects by some local and state governments.
   ``Until very recently ... the need to replenish and expand public
works has been largely ignored,'' John E. Petersen, senior director
of the Government Finance Research Center, noted in a separate
report on infrastructure needs and financing released at the forum.
   ``By the early 1980s, the infrastructure was wearing out faster
than it was being replaced,'' he said.
   Last year, one of the nation's busiest bridges _ the
Williamsburg, which links Manhattan and Brooklyn _ was shut down for
more than three months after inspectors discovered extensive
corrosion. The bridge was built in 1903 for bicycles and horse-drawn
buggies. When closed it was carrying more than 100,000 vehicles and
420 trains daily.
   Koenen noted that just a few weeks ago, the 122-year-old Roebling
Suspension Bridge, which spans the Ohio River in Cincinnati, was
closed briefly after it began swaying under heavy pedestrian traffic
following the Bengals-Seahawks football game. But officials later
declared the bridge safe.
   Supporting the MBIA survey on projected volume, Petersen's study
found that capital investment needs are by far the greatest in the
areas of highways, streets and bridges. Next to that comes public
transit, water supply and distribution, waste water treatment, solid
waste disposal and airports.
   Petersen also noted that changing population patterns will affect
municipal bond issuance.
   ``If the population trend continues, 62 percent of the population
will live in the South and West by 2010, compared with 48 percent in
the 1970s,'' he said. ``That's going to stimulate spending needs.''
   Another factor that could effect future municipal spending is the
so-called ``Greenhouse Effect,'' or the pollution-caused warming of
the atmosphere, Petersen said.
   ``Recent studies indicate that global warming, with the resulting
rise in water levels due to polar melting, will affect economic
activity and infrastructure spending in coastal areas.''

<HEAD>1988 Futures Volume Set New Record; Drought Boosted Ag Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Trading volume on the nation's futures exchanges rose by a modest
7.3 percent last year as a drought-driven surge in agricultural
hedging and speculation helped offset a slump in the stock-index
futures markets.
   Volume on the 11 U.S. futures exchanges totaled a record 295
million contracts, compared with 275 million contracts traded in
1987, according to figures compiled by the Futures Industry
Association, a trade group.
   The increase compares with volume expansion of nearly 25 percent
in 1987 and continues a growth pattern of more than two decades.
   On futures exchanges, people trade contracts for future
deliveries of commodities _ such as grain, cattle, gold and crude
oil _ and financial instruments, including government securities,
stocks and foreign currencies.
   Commercial players _ those directly involved in producing, buying
or selling a particular commodity or financial instrument _ use
futures to hedge against losses in their business dealings or
financial investments. Speculators are investors who seek to profit
from the fluctuating prices of the contracts.
   Agricultural futures trading in the United States dates back more
than 120 years but financial futures, introduced in the early 1970s,
now account for most trades.
   Last year, financial futures trading accounted for 139.1 million,
or nearly 57 percent, of the total futures volume, FIA figures show.
   More than half of those trades involved the Chicago Board of
Trade's U.S. Treasury bond contract, with a volume of 70.3 million,
a 5.2 percent increase over the previous year.
   The Chicago Board of Trade, the oldest and largest U.S. futures
exchange, also reported a dramatic resurgence in grain and soybean
futures trading. Wheat volume soared by 75 percent, soybean trading
jumped 69 percent, and corn volume surged 53 percent as the worst
drought in 50 years withered crops and sent prices skyrocketing.
   ``The drought of 1988 added significant increases to volume in
agricultural trading,'' said Karsten Mahlmann, the exchange's
chairman. He said the exchange's more lightly traded agricultural
options, hedging instruments that are similar to futures, also
``worked extremely well to manage risk in the agricultural markets.''
   Overall volume at the Chicago Board of Trade grew by 12.5 percent
in 1988, the 20th consecutive year of record volume for the
exchange. With a total of 143.1 million futures and options
contracts traded, the Chicago Board of Trade's share of the industry
was 48.5 percent.
   The nation's second-largest futures exchange, the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, did not fare as well. Officials reported a 7.5
percent decrease in volume, mainly due to a 40 percent drop in
stock-index futures trading at the exchange.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange trades the Standard &amp; Poor's 500
stock-index futures contract, by far the industry's leading contract
of its type despite the drop in volume. Officials blamed the decline
on slack interest in stock market investing following the crash of
October 1987.
   But the Chicago Mercantile Exchange also reported a 6.6 percent
increase in foreign currency futures trading, including a 6.3
percent gain in its Eurodollar futures contract _ the exchange's
volume leader _ and a 20 percent leap in yen futures.
   Overall volume at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange last year
totaled 78 million contracts, giving the exchange a 26.4 percent
share of the industry.
   The New York Mercantile Exchange, home of crude-oil and platinum
futures, scored a 33.5 percent volume increase with 34.3 million
contracts traded. The volume placed the exchange third in the
industry with an 11.6 percent share.
   New York's Commodity Exchange, which specializes in gold, silver
and copper, saw its volume shrink by 10 percent to 19.2 million for
a 6.5 percent share of the industry.
   New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange traded a record 10
million contracts, up from 6.3 million in 1988, for a 3.4 percent
share.
   Trading volume at Chicago's MidAmerica Commodity Exchange reached
a record 3.4 million contracts, a 44 gain over 1987, giving the
exchange a 1.2 percent share of the industry.
   The New York Cotton Exchange reported a record turnover of 3.1
million cotton, orange-juice and financial futures contracts, a 19
percent gain, for a 1 percent share of the industry.
   The remaining 1.4 percent of the industry volume was divided
among the New York Futures Exchange, the Kansas City Board of Trade,
the Minneapolis Grain Exchange and the Chicago Rice &amp; Cotton
Exchange.
   These figures do not include statistics from the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, which trades only financial options.

<HEAD>Stocks Defy Rising Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   These are uneasy times for stock market investors
who key their strategies to the ups and downs of interest rates.
   For the past several weeks, interest rates have been rising,
especially in the short-term money markets.
   That's supposed to spell trouble for stocks, by acting as a drag
on the economy and by luring investors' money away from the stock
market and into interest-bearing securities such as Treasury bills.
   But things haven't worked out that way of late. The stock market
has rallied since mid-November, recently reaching a series of new
highs since the October 1987 crash.
   A lot of money managers at investing institutions who have been
shying away from stocks are now faced with the possibility that a
train might be leaving the station without them.
   A substantial corps of skeptics on Wall Street remains
unimpressed by the market's recent strength.
   Some of these observers say it is merely a temporary
manifestation of the ``January effect,'' a much-documented tendency
of stock prices to rise in the early stages of a new year.
   In simplest terms, the January effect is believed to arise from
several seasonal factors _ including the cessation of yearend
selling for tax purposes, and infusions of new money into pension
plans.
   If this is the only driving force for the market's advance, the
rally is presumably in for a limited run.
   A good many analysts, however, contend that the rise in stock
prices is also the product of an abundance of fear and pessimism
that still persists.
   Market rallies typically begin in periods of gloom, and end when
all the doubters have been converted to optimistic views and
expended all their reserve buying power.
   ``Conservative attitudes of individuals, 10 percent cash reserves
in mutual funds and similar high cash positions of pension accounts
are the best sources of support for the stock market,'' said Rao
Chalasani at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
   ``The U.S. continues to be a place of value for foreign
investors. Those dynamics will support the stock market as long as
earnings hold up.''
   In the past week, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose
31.78 to 2,226.07.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.62 to
159.58; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
climbed 2.35 to 387.09, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 4.53 at 315.93.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 153.57 million shares a day,
against 153.39 million in the first week of 1989.
   Analysts who take a bullish view say there is another possible
explanation for the recent gains in stock prices.
   It could be, they suggest, that interest rates will soon stop
rising and turn downward.
   ``The so-called upward pressure on interest rates may prove to be
illusory,'' said William LeFevre at Advest Inc.
   Utility stocks, highly sensitive to changes in interest-rate
expectations, have lately traded well above their low points of last
year, he points out.
   The behavior of the Dow Jones utility average ``says interest
rates are headed lower, not higher'' in the intermediate to
long-term future, LeFevre maintains.
   Talk has even begun to stir on the Street of an increasingly
powerful rise in stock and bond prices should the economy slow and
the Federal Reserve relax its recent credit-tightening.
   ``When that occurs, all will know that short rates are due to
peak and the proper place for assets is in long bonds and stocks,''
said John Connolly at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``We could see a
scramble develop sometime soon.''

   Indications that world oil production is
declining helped strengthen some crude oil prices this week.
   OPEC Secretary General Subroto said Friday the cartel's output
for January could fall below the 18.5 million barrel-a-day target.
   In addition, ongoing problems in the North Sea have reduced oil
production by about 500,000 barrels a day.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 31
cents to close at $18.48 a barrel Friday after advancing 3 cents on
Thursday. The contract traded as high as $18.64 but retreated on
profit-taking, analysts said. Other contract months were mixed.
   However, traders noted that prices of crude contracts between
June and November fell. OPEC's accord took effect Jan. 1 and extends
for six months. Many economists speculate that OPEC will raise its
volume in the second half of the year.
   WTI was trading in the $15 range when members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed in November to cut back
production to 18.5 million barrels. Traders say prices have risen
amid signs OPEC is abiding by the agreement and new speculation on
Friday encouraged further buying.
   ``A statement from Subroto that January production would be below
the quota was probably the main factor moving the market,'' William
Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said Friday
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
futures rose. The February contract for gasoline closed 0.70 cent
higher at 49.97 cents a gallon.
   Heating oil futures ended the day mixed, with the February
contract up 0.11 cent at 52.95 cents a gallon. The March contract
also rose, but subsequent months declined.
   Heating oil prices have not firmed along with other energy prices
recently as demand has fallen off due to seasonal factors, traders
said.
