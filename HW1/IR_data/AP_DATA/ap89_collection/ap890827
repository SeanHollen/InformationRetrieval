<HEAD>Egypt and Jordan Call For Syria To Cooperate With Arab League</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt and Jordan on Sunday urged Syria to
cooperate with an Arab league committee appointed to mediate an end
to conflict in Lebanon that has left nearly 800 people in less than
six months.
   King Hussein of Jordan met with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak
in Cairo for three hours of talks on regional issues, principally
the escalating violence in Lebanon between Christian troops and
Syrian-backed Moslems.
   The latest round in the conflict broke out in March when
Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, blockaded illegal
Moslem-run ports. The Syrians responded by blockading the
310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Mubarak said he hoped ``Syria would cooperate with'' a
three-member Arab League committee of Algeria, Morocco and Saudi
Arabia appointed in a May Arab summit in Casablanca, Morocco to
mediate peace in Lebanon.
   ``Must not leave the solution for what is happening in Lebanon to
non-Arab countries, because that would make us appear weak,''
Mubarak told reporters after the meeting. ``We as Arabs are
responsible for what happens in Lebanon.''
   Mubarak apparently referred to French and Soviet negotiations
last week with Christian and Moslem leaders in Lebanon and Syria.
The Soviet Union is Syria's principal weapons supplier.
   Hussein said, however, it was uncertain whether the Arab League
committee will be able to carry out its mandate to end to the war.
The committee said this month that its efforts had failed and blamed
Syria for refusing to schedule withdrawal of its estaimted 40,000
troops from Lebanon.
   ``We must wait and see whether the committee will continue its
work or not,'' Hussein said.
   Syria entered Lebanon with a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate but became involved on the Moslem side of that country's
civil war.
   A Jordanian official said in Amman on condition of anonymity,
that Jordan, Egypt and other Arab countries were mediating with the
Syrians to end Lebanon's violence.
   On Saturday, Hussein met with Syria's foreign minister, Farouk
el-Sharaa, in Amman.
   Egypt and Syria have no diplomatic ties, but relations have
improved recently after 10 years of bitterness that followed Cairo's
peace treaty with Israel.

   Hurricane Kiko, packing winds up to 115
mph, hit the southeastern coast of the Baja California peninsula
Saturday, blowing down trees and unleashing downpours, officials
said.
   The storm lashed La Rivera, Buenavista and other small towns on
the coast of the sparsely populated Baja California Sur state.
   ``The wind is very strong. There's a lot of water. There are
trees down. But there have been no casualties,'' Antonio Alvarez
Acevedo, public security director in San Jose del Cabo, said of La
Rivera. About 4,000 people live in the town and surrounding area, he
said.
   La Rivera is about 75 miles south of La Paz, the state capital.
   ``The eye is brushing along the southeastern edge'' of the
peninsula, approximately between the town of Buenavista and Los
Barriles, Bob Case of the National Hurricane Center in in Coral
Gables, Fla., said by telephone.
   Buenavista is about 60 miles southeast of La Paz and Los Barriles
lies between the two cities.
   At 11 p.m. local time, (2 a.m. EDT Sunday) the storm was located
near latitude 23.9 north and longitude 109.7 west, or about 40 miles
east-southeast of La Paz. It was moving northwest at about 5 mph,
said the National Weather Service in Miami.
   The weather bulletin said Kiko made landfall but did not say
when. The storm expected to lose strength as it crossed the
peninsula in the next 24 hours, it said.
   Electricity was off in La Rivera, Buenavista and in San Jose del
Cabo, near the tip of the peninsula, Alvarez Acevedo said.
   Alvarez Acevedo said the few hotels along the coast around La
Rivera had not been evacuated.
   ``They are the type of construction that can take it,'' he said.
   Waves more than 10 feet high were crashing on the coast in
Buenavista, a town of 800 people, said Hector Castro Marron, the
security and transit agent on duty.
   Many people who were staying in the town's three hotels took the
Saturday morning plane to Los Angeles, he said.
   Heavy rain fell afternoon, rushing down normally dry gullies, he
said. He said about four families who live along a gully in
Buenavista had been told they should leave their homes.
   A strong wind was blowing about 7 p.m. (9 p.m. EDT), and some
residents had taped or boarded up windows, he said.
   According to the U.S. National Weather Service in Miami, Kiko was
a ``small'' hurricane with sustained winds up to 115 mph Saturday
night.
   La Paz, with 160,000 inhabitants, has half the population of the
state, which occupies the southern half of the Baja California
Peninsula. It is about 760 miles south of San Diego.
   Zatarain said emergency supplies were being mustered and shelters
stocked with food and blankets throughout the state. Storm warnings
were being broadcast, civil defense units had been mobilized and
military units were standing by, he said.
   Ferry service between the peninsula and the mainland was
canceled, he said.
   On the mainland, the Sinaloa state government had an emergency
plan in effect, the government news agency Notimex said.
   The airline Aeromexico canceled or diverted service to Los
Mochis, Mazatlan and La Paz on Saturday after making an early
morning flight to the three cities, the reservations office said.
   The weather service said hurricane warnings were in effect for
the Gulf of California side of the Baja peninsula from the southern
tip northward to Bahia Conception, about 200 miles north of La Paz.
   It said possible flash floods and mudslides could occur.

   Hurricane Kiko slammed into the Baja
California peninsula with 115 mph winds that blew down homes and
forced hundreds of people to evacuate, but it lost strength Sunday
as it passed over hilly terrain.
   After striking the southeastern coast of the peninsula and
driving toward the Pacific Ocean, the storm's top sustained winds
fell to 90 mph by 5 a.m. (8 a.m. EDT), the National Weather Service
in Miami said.
   Kiko bore down hardest on La Rivera, a city of 4,000 people 75
miles south of La Paz, said Lt. Ignacio Cortez Telechea, assistant
state government director. ``There were homes of thin wood and
laminated cardboard that blew down,'' he said. ``They had palm or
cardboard roofs that blew away. Trees, antennas, electrical poles
fell.''
   There were no immediate reports of injuries, but more than 300
people left their homes and were housed in shelters in the area,
officials said.
   Sgt. Ruben Burgoin Peralta, the police officer on duty in San
Jose del Cabo, said 20 homes were destroyed in La Rivera, which is
in his district.
   At 5 a.m., the storm was located near latitude 23.7 north and
longitude 110.5 west, or 35 miles south of La Paz. The capital of
Baja California is 760 miles south of San Diego. The storm was
moving west at about 5 mph, said the National Weather Service.
   The weather bulletin said Kiko hit the coast at midnight Saturday
and lost strength as it struck the coastal cliffs and high terrain
of the peninsula.
   The weather service said hurricane warnings were in effect for
the Gulf of California side of the Baja peninsula from the southern
tip northward to Bahia Conception, 200 miles north of La Paz. They
were also declared for the Pacific side south of San Carlos.
   Bob Case, a hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center
in Coral Gables, Fla., said the worst of Kiko is over for Baja.
   ``The biggest problem is continued heavy rains, flash floods and
mudslides,'' he said in a telephone interview early Sunday.
   ``It should come out over the open waters of the Pacific during
the day and resume a west-northwest track, and we expect it to
continually weaken as it heads over cooler waters in the next day or
two,'' he said.
   The storm also lashed Buenavista and other small towns south of
La Paz on the coast of the sparsely populated state and sent water
rushing down normally dry gullies, stopping traffic along the
highway from San Jose del Cabo to La Paz, officials said.
   Electricity was out from Cabo San Lucas, at the tip of the
peninsula, up the coast to towns south of La Paz. The lack of power
also cut water service since pumps are electric.
   Antonio Alvarez Acevedo, the San Jose del Cabo public security
director, said the few hotels along the coast around La Rivera had
not been evacuated.
   ``They are the type of construction that can take it,'' he said.
   Francisco Zatarain, the state public security coordinator, said
emergency supplies were being mustered and shelters stocked with
food and blankets throughout the state. Storm warnings were being
broadcast, civil defense units had been mobilized and military units
were standing by, he said.
   The airline Aeromexico canceled or diverted service to Los

<HEAD>Wisconsin Bell, Union Reach Tentative Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wisconsin Bell and the union representing some
4,200 striking workers reached a tentative settlement early Sunday
but the workers would stay off the job until their counterparts in
other Midwestern states reached settlements, a spokesman said.
   The settlement came a day after workers at Ohio Bell also reached
a tentative contract. Both state companies are subsidiaries of the
five-state Ameritech regional telephone company, which has been
strikebound since Aug. 13.
   ``We are still on strike until all (bargaining) tables with
Ameritech are resolved,'' Hugh Walsh, president of Communication
Workers of America Local 4603 said in a tape recorded message to
union members announcing the Wisconsin settlement.
   Wisconsin Bell spokesman Vyto Kapocius confirmed the settlement
but declined to comment further, saying the company would reveal the
details at an afternoon news conference.
   Some 37,000 CWA workers at Ameritech subsidiaries in Illinois,
Ohio, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin walked off the job Aug. 13.
The regional telephone company, one of the so-called ``Baby Bells''
created by the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984, is based in Chicago.
   The Ameritech strike is one of four that began earlier this
month, involving a total of 200,000 workers in 20 states and the
District of Columbia.
   Unions have negotiated tentative settlements with striking
employees at Pacific Telesis, which serves California and Nevada;
and Bell Atlantic, which covers West Virginia, Virginia, Maryland,
Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and theDistrict of Columbia.
   In New York, NYNEX Corp. said Friday it had agreed to resume
bargaining with its striking workers for the first formal talks
since that walkout started almost three weeks ago. That regional
company serves New York and most of New England.

<HEAD>Child Turns 7 In Hiding As Custody Fight Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GINSBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilary Antonia Foretich turned 7 last week in
hiding, with her father marking the birthday at a subdued Capitol
Hill ceremony and her mother nearing two years in jail for refusing
to disclose the little girl's whereabouts.
   Hilary has been missing for two years on Monday, since a
Washington judge ordered her mother, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, to
surrender the youngster for unsupervised visits with her father.
Morgan refused to comply and remains in jail on contempt of court
charges.
   Morgan claims that Hilary's father, Dr. Eric Foretich, sexually
abused the girl. Foretich vehemently denies the allegation and
contends that his former wife is suffering from delusions.
   While the parents' struggle continues, mental health
professionals are questioning whether Hilary can survive the ordeal
without emotional scars.
   ``For any child, a separation from both parents on an abrupt and
sudden basis is very harmful and could cause serious long-term
consequences,'' said Dr. Jerry Wiener, president of the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. ``There's no way that
she could not be significantly affected from this experience, and I
would think that any effects could not be undone.''
   Constance Ahrons, a noted California psychologist in the field of
child custody cases and author of the book ``Divorced Families,''
said Hilary's separation from her parents could leave the child
feeling isolated, even under protective custody.
   ``This is bound to have a profound effect on her,'' Ahrons said.
``If she was close to her parents, she may feel abandoned. In a case
like this, the child is the most vulnerable because of her age and
because she has no control in what happens to her.''
   Linda Holman, Hilary's court-appointed attorney, declined to be
interviewed and said she refuses all media requests for interviews
concerning this case. She said such interviews ``contribute to the
long-term negative impact on Hilary.''
   District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon has said
Morgan will remain in jail for contempt of court until she
surrenders Hilary.
   A three-judge panel of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals,
the city's highest local court, ordered that Morgan be released.
However, the entire court overturned that decision on Aug. 21 _
Hilary's seventh birthday _ and ordered a new hearing on the case
before the full court next month.
   That same day, Foretich and about a dozen family members and
friends marked his daughter's birthday with a small ceremony on the
steps of the Capitol. Legislation passed by the House and awaiting a
vote by the full Senate would limit the length of contempt jailings
in the nation's capital and, in effect, free Morgan.
   Later that same day, Foretich told The Associated Press he thinks
Hilary is suffering through an experience that could ultimately lead
to an early death.
   ``If my daughter is not brought back within the near future, it
will be too late. She will lose her ability to ever recover from
this,'' he said. ``I knew her to be a resilient child, but at some
point that resilience is going to fade. I don't want my daughter to
be an example, another statistic, of a teen-age suicide because she
feels abandoned by both parents and has been led to believe that her
father is a pervert and her mother is a crazy woman.''
   Morgan did not respond to a written request for an interview
relayed through jail officials.
   However, Mary Froning, a child psychologist who treated Hilary
for two years at her mother's request, said the only hardship that
the young girl has undergone is being apart from her mother for so
long.
   ``Her ordeal is being separated from her mother, the only person
in the world she trusts,'' Froning said. ``She is with the people
she chose to be with, so I have every reason to believe she is
safe.''
   Wiener, however, wondered whether the one-way communication that
he presumes Hilary receives isn't hurting the girl.
   ``One presumes she is told positive things about her mother and
negative things about her father,'' Weiner said. ``That is not
constructive, not at all.''
   Ahrons said she also was concerned that some problems could
result from the girl acting as a fugitive to disguise her real
identity.
   ``There are certainly possible problems with issues concerning
her own identity,'' said Ahrons. ``It could have some effect on her
life. A profound effect? Who knows?''
   Foretich has his own theory. ``At what point will Hilary cease to
even know who she is?'' he asked.
   ``I mean, how many times has her name been changed, has her hair
been colored? Does she even know who she is anymore? Her self-image
will soon be destroyed, if it hasn't already happened.''

   A storm with 55 mph winds and heavy rains caused
landslides and flooding Sunday that left two people dead and three
missing, police said.
   Seven people were reported injured by objects thrown by the winds.
   The storm, earlier designated Typhoon Roger, had been downgraded
to a tropical storm by the time it hit western Japan, forecasters
said.
   The heavy rains flooded 550 houses, caused about 70 landslides
and damaged or destroyed roads in 40 places, a police official said.
   The storm hit Cape Muroto on Sunday morning and had moved north
to Fukui in central Japan by early evening, forecasters said.
   The police official said a 61-year-old man was buried by a
landslide in Ome on the outskirts of Tokyo, and an 8-year-old girl
drowned after falling into a swollen river in Saitama state
northwest of Tokyo.
   The official said three men were missing. Two of them fell into
flooded rivers, one while repairing a bridge.

   A macabre drama unfolded for a small
fellowship who, with horror and fascination, watched television film
clips of the first clear pictures of the wreck of the Edmund
Fitzgerald.
   ``Oh yes, I've watched it. I can't not watch it,'' said Ruth
Hudson, whose only child, Bruce, 22, died aboard the steel freighter
during a fierce storm Nov. 10, 1975. His body and those of 28 other
crewmen remain at the bottom of Lake Superior.
   For three days last week, explorers using a submersible robot
penetrated the cold, deep water that has cloaked and preserved the
Fitzgerald since its sinking. Their video images will provide data
on the wreck as well as the technology to study other underwater
sites.
   For the families of the Fitzgerald crew, the expedition opened
wounds.
   ``People say it gets easier. Naturally, it's eased some. But to
me it was just yesterday,'' said Hudson, of North Olmstead, Ohio.
   Startling footage of the 556-foot-deep wreck _ funded by the
Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society _ was difficult for Hudson
to watch.
   ``It's a hard time for me. It brings back all of the panic,'' she
said. ``But I can't say I don't want them to do it. I have a lot of
friends that are really angry. They ask, `Why are they doing that to
the families?' But this is history. My son would have wanted it
shown.''
   She feels good about public fascination with the wreck. ``They
really haven't forgotten,'' she said.
   The tragedy became American folklore, particularly after Canadian
balladeer Gordon Lightfoot wrote a hit song in 1976 about the death
of the boat he called ``the pride of the American side.''
   ``All that remains is the faces and the names of the wives and
the sons and the daughters,'' he sang.
   Edmund Bacon Fitzgerald said by telephone from Tennessee last
week that his father, the Edmund Fitzgerald for whom the the
freighter was named, was haunted by the wreck until his death in
1986. The father was president of Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance
Co., which built the ship in 1958.
   The Edmund Fitzgerald left Superior, Wis., under threatening
skies Nov. 9 on what was to have been its last trip down the Great
Lakes before docking for the winter.
   By the next day, the Fitzgerald was in a gale. Capt. Ernest
McSorley reported topside damage and a list to his boat as 30-foot
waves crashed over the freighter.
   Just 15 miles short of the protection of Whitefish Bay, McSorley
spoke by ship's radio to the Arthur M. Anderson, another freighter
struggling through the storm. Although the beacon light that marked
the entrance to the bay had gone out, both skippers were sure they'd
make it.
   ``We are holding our own,'' McSorley told the Anderson's crew.
   Shortly afterward, the Fitzgerald disappeared from radar screens
without even a distress call. No bodies and very little wreckage was
found.
   There are conflicting theories on how the Fitzgerald sank _
whether water entered its hold through leaking hatch covers or it
hit a shoal. Underwater divers later found that the ship went down
with such force it broke in two.
   The search robot's first images Wednesday were of a stark white
bow rising crumpled and torn out of the blackness. Researchers were
struck not by the damage but by the incongruity of a gleaming water
cooler surrounded by overturned equipment in the pilothouse.
   Bill Peckol of Ashtabula, Ohio, is eager to see the footage being
filmed for a National Geographic Society television show. He's
already seen the snippets on newscasts.
   ``Naturally, they're not going to change anything that has
happened,'' said Peckol, whose 20-year-old son, Karl, died on the
ship. ``But maybe they can shed more light on what possibly
happened.''
   Bettie Peckol remembers her relief when Karl took a job on the
Fitzgerald, transferring from a smaller and, she thought, more
dangerous boat named Sensibar.
   ``The irony of it is, the Sensibar is still sailing,'' said Mrs.
Peckol, who skipped newscasts of the wreckage. ``I'm not happy about
opening up a lot of old wounds. I guess you never forget the loss of
a child.
   ``Plus, I don't believe in living in the past. I want to remember
Karl the way he was the last time I saw him.''
   That was Nov. 7, 1975. He was waving goodbye.

<TEXT>
   Suppose you have a craving for some
``Bush Sauce'' with your quail dinner. Or maybe you want to snuggle
your feet into a pair of American flag slippers adorned with George
and Barbara dolls. Perhaps you'd just like to pick up a ``Read my
lips'' wall clock.
   Kennebunkport is your shopping destination.
   The proliferation of Bush paraphernalia in this resort town of
nearly 3,000 people is giving tourists a variety of souvenir options
to prove _ once they get home to Quebec or Connecticut or Kansas _
that they have, indeed, been to the summer vacation home of the 41st
president.
   What kitchen, for example couldn't use a little refrigerator
magnet with a plastic Maine lobster and the words ``Kennebunkport,
Maine. Home of George W. Bush'' on it?
   Those sell for $2.50 each at the What's In Store, a curio shop
that also features mugs emblazoned with the eagle symbol of the
United States and a picture of Bush's home on Walker's Point.
   In the same shop, you can have your picture taken with a lifesize
picture of Bush for $5.
   Or how about a kid's bib that says ``I was a guest at Walker's
Point, Kennebunkport,'' or a dishtowel bearing the blue grinning
image of the president at $4.99 each?
   The president himself gave a plug Friday for a new item selling
at the Cape Arundel Golf Club shop.
   ``You want me to sell some shirts for you?'' he asked golf pro
Ken Raynor as they teed off. He turned to a group of reporters and
photographers and pointed to the insignia on his knit shirt. ``It
says D.C. and Maine. They're really nice. I'm recommending them.''
   The ``new presidential shirts'' sell for $36 in the golf shop,
where photos of Bush driving a golf cart adorn the wall.
   Back in the quaint center of town, all manner of Bush-inspired
T-shirts are hot sellers. Slogans emblazoned across shirts include
the well-worn ``KenneBushport,'' ``The Summer White House,
Kennebunkport, Maine,'' with a picture of Bush's Walker's Point
home, and ``George Bush Sleeps Here.''
   For those getting ready for Halloween, the Paper Plus toys and
curio store sells cardboard Bush masks, with cutout eyes, for $3.95.
The masks are displayed on a wall between an autographed photo of
comedian Pee Wee Herman and a photo of Joan Collins, smiling in a
white negligee and autographed with the words, ``To all my darlings
at Paper Plus. I'll always cherish this day.''
   The store also sells the ``Sleeping Partnerzzz'' slippers, at $30
a pair, which feature plastic George and Barbara Bush heads peeping
out from flag-striped slippers. Each plastic doll head rests on a
pillow, also part of the slipper, emblazoned with the eagle seal of
the United States.
   Mrs. Bush grimaced a few months back when a local restaurateur
showed her a pair of the slippers.
   The Open Door Gift Shop features Bush Sauce, created by The Hagen
House company of neargy Orgunquit, Maine, at $5.25 for a 16-ounce
jar.
   Proprietor Jody Bibber says it's so popular ``I can't keep it in.
... It's just a fun item.''
   The label says the tomato and onion relish is ``excellent with
quail'' and makes a nice garnish for chicken or fish.
   In keeping with the Bush jargon, one flavor is labelled
``kinder-gentler,'' and the label also urges the shopper to ``Shower
your taste buds with a thousand points of light.''
   Another Bush-ism inspired a $46 clock at the Argo gift shop.
   The clock is in the shape of bright red lips with a cartoon-style
balloon coming from them carrying the words ``Read my lips.''
   Proprietor Ron Joslyn said he's not really into Bush
paraphernalia but picked up two of the novelty clocks at a craft
show. He sent one to Bush via the son of a friend who cares for the
Bushes' pool. He doesn't know if the president received it.
   Irreverence is the key to some of the novelties. One version of
the Bush mask carries the caution: ``Not intended for use by
children under the age of 3 or by Dan Quayle. May cause drowsiness
while operating heavy machinery, pitching horseshoes, vetoing
legislation. ... Misuse may result in 1,000 points of light.''
   Lisa Mills, who runs a corporate and personal shopping service,
said her clients are looking for all types of more refined
Bush-oriented gifts.
   ``Everybody wants Maine products with Bush's home painted on
them,'' she said adding that a popular item has been a $35
breakfast-in-bed tray with Walker's Point on it.
   The more thrifty souvenir shopper can pick up plastic thimbles,
at $6.99 each, with Bush's picture on them, or shot glasses, $3.95
each, bearing the presidential seal and the words Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   Chamber of Commerce Chairwoman Barbara Aiello, contending that
Kennebunkport hasn't let itself be overwhelmed by tackiness,
acknowledged that some of the Bush products are ``borderline
tasteful'' and that ``expensive tacky is creeping in.''

<HEAD>Record Lag Expected in Third World Interest Payments</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Major Third World countries are expected to
fall nearly another $5 billion behind in the interest payments and
U.S. and other banks this year, but, unlike individual debtors,
there's no car to repossess and no home to foreclose on.
   Sovereign governments do not allow foreign bankers to seize the
property of their citizens, although sometimes lenders are allowed
to buy up pieces of it in debt-equity swaps.
   Fifteen countries singled out by the United States for special
help will fall behind by another $4.868 billion in their interest
payments this year, raising their arrears to a record $15.079
billion, according to the banks which are owed the money.
   Brazil, Argentina and Mexico owe the most, according figures on
the 15 major debtors compiled by the Institute of International
Finance, a group of the leading lending banks, and made available to
The Associated Press last week.
   Bankers know them as ``the Baker 15'' after Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, who made up the list in 1985 when he was
secretary of the Treasury. Most are in Latin America, but the list
also includes Nigeria, the Philippines and Yugoslavia.
   By the end of 1990, the 15 countries will owe about $524 billion
to lending banks and governments, with nearly another $50 billion in
interest payments falling due. Most have not paid anything on the
principal of their debt since the crisis began in 1982.
   Christian Barrett, an economist at the institute, said falling
behind on servicing the debt is a conscious policy of Third World
government leaders.
   ``Their governments need capital, and that's the way they decide
to get it,'' Barrett said. ``But it's a policy that discourages new
lending from abroad and discourages their own citizens from bringing
home the money they've sent abroad.''
   More money has been leaving Third World countries than has
arrived in them this decade. Leaders of the debtor countries
complain that the net outflow _ about $30 billion last year _ is
unnatural and a major cause of their declining standards of living
through the 1980s.
   ``Poverty has increased because of debt,'' said Finance Minister
Bernard Chidzero of Zimbabwe, whose country owes a modest $2.5
billion and is not among the 15 major debtors.
   ``Malnutrition has increased as a result of more money going into
debt service,'' Chidzero said. ``There is a decline in social
services, because they cannot be maintained because people want to
service debt. And I think that is an untenable situation.''
   The interest payments are cited as a major factor in the net
exodus but part of it also is due to their wealthy citizens putting
their money in the United States, Switzerland and other safe havens.
Much of this ``capital flight'' is illegal, and there are no
reliable figures on it.
   Barrett thinks that citizens of many debtor countries have
stashed away assets abroad that approach or even exceed the value of
their own countries' debts to the commercial banks.
   Finance Minister Mailson Nobrega of Brazil, which owes about $109
billion and is the Third World's biggest debtor, predicts there will
be economic chaos if a solution is not found soon.
   ``If we do not find a solution for the debt, then it will be
solved by itself through political turmoil, through social unrest,
and then industrial nations will wake up and find a solution,'' he
said. ``So, it is better for them to help us find a solution now.''
   Norbrega and Chidzero made their comments on a program prepared
by WETA, a public television station in Washington. The program will
be broadcast Sept. 28 when the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund hold their annual meetings here
   Brazil and Argentina pose two of the biggest problems. Brazil
already has delayed some payments and the prospects are uncertain
that it will make a $3 billion payment due next month.
   Brazilian leaders say they are not planning another stop on
payments, but the creditor banks say they expect the country to pile
up another $700 million of interest arrears this year.
   Last year Brazil caught up on its arrears through an agreement
with the private banks and the multigovernment International
Monetary Fund (IMF). New loans were provided on the condition that
Brazil's government reduce its own borrowing at home.
   Since then, the IMF has said that Brazil failed to live up to the
agreement and has halted further disbursement of the new loans. Many
private banks followed suit. What happens next depends largely on
the results of Brazil's upcoming November election in which the debt
burden is a major issue.
   Argentina, where the new government of President Carlos Menem is
settling in, will owe about $68.6 billion at the end of this year,
according to the bankers' institute. Of that, $5.8 billion
represents past-due interest.
   Total debt of Third World countries is estimated at $1.3
trillion. But many big debtors are not considered in financial
trouble. Among them are India, with a $60.2 billion; China, with
$42.4 billion, and the Soviet Union, with $39.3 billion.
   For the troubled countries, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady
has achieved a minor breakthrough by getting multigovernment-owned
World Bank and IMF to effectively guarantee interest payments on new
loans or reduced interest rates proffered by private banks in
debt-reduction agreements.
   So far deals have been struck with Mexico and the Philippines.
But it is uncertain how much the arrangements will actually reduce
borrowers' debt-service costs.
   Many fear the debtor nations will be left only further in the
red. And some influential governments are skeptical that their
taxpayers will be stuck for the World Bank and IMF guarantees if and
when the deals sour.

   Independence. A year ago, only a few
former political prisoners dared whisper the word in the nation's
three Baltic republics.
   Today, it is the goal of a mass movement, putting the three tiny
lands in direct conflict with the Kremlin.
   On Wednesday, a 370-mile chain of determined Baltic families
stood hand in hand, protesting the Soviet annexation of their
independent nations. But that was just the most dramatic
manifestation of a profound change that has occurred in recent
months on the Soviet Union's western frontier.
   The activist groups of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, known as
the People's Front, once worked for more authority within the Soviet
Union. Now, they are openly calling for restoration of their free
nations.
   ``The declarations of the People's Front in the past year have
become ever closer to the ideals our people have carried in their
hearts for all these 50 years,'' Estonian People's Front leader and
lawmaker Marju Lauristin said.
   ``All of us would like to have freedom, and freedom without
independence isn't realistic,'' she said.
   From the Kremlin's point of view, it is Baltic independence
that's unrealistic, and a sharply worded statement from the
Communist Party Central Committee on Saturday made that point clear.
   ``Things have gone far. Serious danger is threatening the Baltic
peoples,'' the policy-making body said. ``People should know what
abyss their nationalist leaders are pushing them toward.''
   ``If they managed to attain their goals, the consequences could
be catastrophic for their people. Their very ability to survive
could come under question,'' it said. The statement was carried on
national television.
   Not long ago, such a warning from the Central Committee would
have sent shudders through many activists. On Sunday, it did little
more than raise eyebrows in the Baltics _ yet another indication of
how far the region has come in establishing for itself an identity
outside the Soviet Union.
   ``We expected this,'' said Raimona Sakalouskis, a spokeswoman for
the Lithuanian activist group. But leaders of the People's Front
movements didn't interrupt their weekend plans to discuss the
statement.
   The radicalization of the fronts is backed by more than 2 million
people who signed documents implying they want freedom from the
Soviet Union.
   In Lithuania, 1.3 million people have signed petitions saying the
Soviet Union annexed their nation ``against the will of
Lithuanians.'' It demands removal of the Soviet ``occupation army''
and seeks U.N. supervision of free elections for a new Baltic
government.
   In Latvia, 430,000 people have registered themselves as desiring
to be considered citizens of an independent Latvia.
   In Estonia, more than 400,000 have signed petitions asking the
Estonian parliament to declare illegal the 1940 Estonian
parliament's approval of the Soviet annexation. That legislature was
elected under Soviet occupation and only Communists were allowed to
run.
   For the Kremlin, the Baltics are front-line territory, home to
missile bases, naval and army units, and vital ports. Activists say
one in eight people in Estonia is a Soviet soldier.
   Soviet television called the idea of redrawing boundaries
``political naivete'' in its coverage of Wednesday's protest.
   ``Independence _ it'll never happen,'' said a Tallinn taxi
driver, the son of a Russian-Estonian marriage. The economy is a
wreck and hopes of developing a new tourist industry fail to take
into consideration the cold, damp Baltic climate, he said.
   Significant opposition to independence also has come from the 2.7
million Russians and other non-Baltic people among the 8 million
Baltic residents.
   Yet amid the pride and determination exhibited by the tens of
thousands of Estonians holding hands on the crest of Tallinn's
Toompea Hill on Wednesday evening, independence seemed possible.
   In the past year, the Baltics have waged a parliamentary and
legal struggle, taking full advantage of each step toward democracy
permitted by the Kremlin. Each move has run into condemnation in
Moscow, giving way to grudging acceptance, and a new push by the
Baltics.
   Estonia made international headlines in November when it claimed
the right to overturn Soviet laws. The Kremlin declared the move
invalid, but Estonia has not backed down.
   A plan for economic autonomy greeted with derision two years ago
has been approved in principle by the new Soviet legislature. Recent
strikes by Russians in Estonia over a voter residency law disturbed
activists, but the Kremlin refrained from issuing orders and strove
for a peaceful compromise.
   Alvydas Medalinskas, a leader of the Lithuanian activist group
Sajudis, said it would not now exist if it had spoken of
independence even in January.
   On Wednesday, the Sajudis council pushed again. It voted to call
for ``creation of an independent democratic Lithuanian republic not
under the power of the Soviet Union.''
   A day earlier, the Lithuanian parliament passed a resolution
calling the Soviet annexation ``an international crime.''
   In Latvia, the People's Front will take a formal vote soon at its
congress on changing its platform to full independence, said
Chairman Ianis Freimanis.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Lightning A More Widespread Danger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers have found lightning to be an even
more widespread danger than was believed, with more than five dozen
Americans losing their lives and hundreds more injured by lightning
last year.
   A hazard whose scattered victims usually attract only local
notice, lightning finally made the national headlines in 1988 by
sparking forest fires that ravaged much of Yellowstone National Park.
   In the past, weather observers have recorded the presence of
lightning through the simple expedient of listening for the thunder
that comes after the electrical discharges.
   But electromagnetic detection systems have discovered that,
because of interference with sound waves, between 22 percent and 40
percent of all lightning occurs without observers hearing the
thunder that follows.
   That is not good news, researchers note, pointing out that
lightning can strike with no warning, sometimes occuring prior to
storms or reaching out ahead of the clouds.
   Detailed thunderstorm records go back to the late 1800s, but they
have always depended on the reports of trained observers, primarily
listening to thunder. This means that the operators of electrical
plants and others who use weather records to anticipate the danger
of lightning have underestimated the risk.
   The toll of 68 lightning deaths in 1988 was the same number as in
1986, tying for the lowest in this decade. In between, however, 1987
recorded the most in the decade with 86 fatalities.
   The long-term average is 96 lightning deaths annually, an average
boosted by several very deadly years back in the 1960s, including
1963 when 210 people were killed by lightning.
   As usual, in 1988 many victims were in the open or under trees,
with several on golf courses or in boats. Florida retained its place
as leading in lightning deaths with nine, while six died in Colorado.
   There were four lightning deaths in Georgia, Michigan, New York,
North Carolina and Wisconsin, the National Weather Service reported.
And states with three fatalities were Minnesota, New Mexico, Texas
and Virginia.
   Alabama, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Puerto
Rico had two lightning deaths each. States reporting one fatality
last year were Arizona, Connecticut, Kentucky, Nebraska, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, Ohio and South Carolina.
   More than half of all electrical storms had only a few
cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, while a small number of storms
had hundreds of strokes.
   Indeed, in Washington, D.C., three years worth of records showed
that nearly one-quarter of all the lightning strokes were accounted
for in just two big storms.
   One reason lightning doesn't get the respect that meteorologists
think it deserves is that it is like automobile accidents, usually
claiming victims one or two at a time over a scattered area.
   The sudden arrival of thousands of volts of electricity, however,
can sometimes involve a lot of people.
   For example, on July 17, 1988, lightning struck a utility pole at
a speedway in Snyder County, Pa. Twenty-two spectators were injured
by the charge which traveled down the pole and into the bleachers.
Happily, no one was killed.
   On July 10 of last year a group playing volleyball in New York's
Prospect Park wasn't so fortunate. Seeking to avoid a sudden
downpour, they sought shelter under a tree. Lightning struck,
killing a 28-year-old man and injuring a dozen others.
   Lightning results from a buildup of electrical charges in a storm
cloud. The process isn't fully understood, but is appears to involve
movement of raindrops up and down in the cloud, propelled by strong
winds.
   When the electrical charges build up to large levels an invisible
``step leader'' moves down from the negatively charged cloud base in
segments about 50 yards long, until it reaches the positively
charged ground.
   When that contact is made, thousands of volts of electricity move
in that circuit _ often in several ``bolts'' giving lightning its
sometimes flickering character.

   A fundamentalist church group improperly
spent $117,000 earmarked for a low-income housing project here and
tried to evade government rules in order to sell the building at an
enormous profit, HUD records and court documents show.
   The sale of The Concord, a 150-unit high-rise building, was
halted through the persistence of tenants who feared they would be
evicted or their rents would triple, lawyers familiar with the case
said.
   The tenants urged the inspector general at the Department of
Housing and Urban Development to conduct an audit, which found
$117,787 in project funds were improperly spent by The Concord's
owner, Community Churches of America.
   Among other things, HUD found that Concord funds were used to pay
church group officers and purchase two vans used for church events.
The housing agency eventually reached a settlement with the group on
the misspent money.
   The Glendale-based fundamentalist group first tried to sell the
apartment building in 1982 for $5.5 million, after paying off the
balance of a $2.05 million HUD loan to the original developer.
Congress has since prohibited pre-payment of HUD loans unless the
housing secretary finds that existing tenants are protected from
eviction or higher rents.
   Community Churches tried again in 1985 to sell the building for
$5.5 million, under the protection of a bankruptcy reorganization.
But the bankruptcy sale was blocked after objections were raised by
tenants, church creditors and HUD lawyers, according to court
records on file in nearby Los Angeles.
   Community Churches was headed by the Rev. William S. McBirnie, a
charismatic preacher. Community Churches acquired The Concord in
1979 and organized a non-profit foundation to run the building in
accordance with HUD regulations. The building was erected in 1966 to
provide subsidized housing for the elderly and handicapped.
   But there were problems from the outset, said Clements Gordon,
81, a former building manager who spearheaded the tenants' fight.
   McBirnie planned to use the Concord to house his own parishioners
and the loyal listeners to his anti-communist radio broadcasts,
``Voice of Americanism,'' she said.
   By 1982, McBirnie decided to sell The Concord because ``we were
constantly being frustrated at making improvements in the building
and not being able to do the good work that we had intended,'' he
said in a legal declaration. He did not return a reporter's
telephone call seeking comment.
   HUD's ``decision to allow the prepayment was very suspect,'' said
Ben Logan, a Los Angeles lawyer representing the building's tenants.
After the HUD loan was repaid, the agency lost its regulatory
control over the building.
   Even the church's lawyer, Philip McNutt, acknowledged, ``The idea
of HUD authorizing this prepayment for the benefit of a private
owner was a real political hot potato at the time.''
   Tenants asked HUD about the legality of the sale, and were told
HUD regulations did not prohibit Community Churches group from
paying off its loan early, Mrs. Gordon said.
   Of course, HUD ``was concerned over the impact upon existing
tenants,'' HUD Deputy Assistant Secretary Philip Abrams wrote Mrs.
Gordon in July 1982. ``We insisted upon an agreement by the project
owners that all existing tenants would have the opportunity to
remain in occupancy without interference by the (new) owner until
such time as they may freely choose to leave.''
   But in testimony about a week later before the House Select
Committee on Aging, Abrams conceded the sale was authorized before
HUD received any written pledge from McBirnie's group guaranteeing
the residents' life tenancy.
   ``The primary concern of the tenants was that they were going to
be evicted or that their rents were going to be raised so high they
were going to have to leave,'' McNutt said. ``But that was never
reflected in reality.''
   In August 1982, Mrs. Gordon and other tenants filed suit to block
the sale of The Concord.
   There was intense pressure to settle because McBirnie's groups
had obtained a short-term loan at high interest to pay off the HUD
loan, McNutt said. McBirnie's groups had used the short-term loan
because they intended to sell the building immediately, but their
plan was thwarted by the tenants' lawsuit, Logan said.
   ``The deal essentially was shoved down the foundation's throat,
because it was either lose the building through foreclosure or
accept the government's offer,'' McNutt said. As a result, a 1983
settlement was reached that included a new $2.6 million HUD loan on
the building and again HUD-imposed rules on its operations.
   New trouble surfaced in May 1985 when a Los Angeles County
Superior Court issued a $1.28 million default judgment against
McBirnie's church groups in a suit that alleged 26 people were
defrauded after investing about $200,000 in loans for new church
facilities. Eventually, 380 creditors filed lawsuits claiming they
were owed as much as $3.7 million.
   The next month, Community Churches filed for bankruptcy
reorganization in Washington, D.C., eventually listing The Concord
as a major asset. In the bankruptcy proceeding, McNutt proposed to
satisfy creditors by selling The Concord to the same buyer lined up
in the 1982 deal.
   The resurrected sale of The Concord in bankruptcy court ``was
just a transparent attempt to do in bankruptcy court what the civil
suits and the congressional hearings had prevented earlier,'' Logan
said.
   After the case was transferred to Los Angeles, the bankruptcy
court appointed an independent trustee to supervise the
reorganization.
   Three more years of legal maneuvering ended July 31 with a deal
that closed the sale of The Concord for $1.35 million and assumption
of the $2.2 million remaining on the HUD loan.
   The new owner, the Retirement Housing Foundation, has pledged to
operate the building according to HUD regulations.

<HEAD>Walesa Says Reforms Will Collapse Unless Economy Improves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Sunday
that the nation's historic political and economic reforms will
collapse unless Poles' living standards improve within six months to
a year.
   ``Society's patience has its limits. It is so bad that if there
is no visible effect (of reform) in half-a-year to a year then
everything will collapse,'' Walesa said in a telephone interview.
   ``In my opinion they (Poles) will not stand any more of it,'' he
said.
   He said another wave of strikes could result, or society could
lose confidence in the Solidarity labor movement's ability to
initiate change.
   Walesa said he issued the same warning during a meeting in Gdansk
on Sunday with Norbert Bluem, West Germany's labor and social
affairs minister.
   The new Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, the first non-Communist leader of a Soviet bloc nation,
has been urging Western nations to increase economic investment in
Poland.
   Walesa met Saturday with Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,
R-Kansas, and his wife, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, and gave
them a letter for President Bush seeking more U.S. economic aid than
the $119 million already promised.
   Poland is beset by chronic food shortages and a $39 billion
foreign debt. The nation has begun free-market reforms, such as
relaxing price controls, that in the short term are likely to result
in a drop in living standards.
   Solidarity, by luring Western aid, is seeking to make the tough
sacrifices needed to bail out the economy as palatable as possible.
   After a Mass at St. St. Brygida's Church in Gdansk, Walesa told a
crowd in the courtyard: ``We must solve all our problems without
economic losses.''
   Solidarity leaders have been seeking a $10 billion assistance
package from Western countries that includes investments, credits
and rescheduling of Poland's debt. Mazowiecki, who assumed office
last week, spent his first days in office meeting U.S., Soviet and
West German officials.
   The Soviets have expressed support for the Solidarity-led
government after previously voicing concerns about the role of the
Communists in the new government and Poland's place in the Warsaw
Pact military alliance.
   Solidarity has said it will allow the Communists to control the
important defense and interior ministries and to have full
participation in the new government. Mazowiecki is expected to
announce a Cabinet within a week.
   Mazowiecki was elected prime minister after Solidarity-backed
candidates trounced Communist candidates in parliamentary elections,
then formed a coalition with two smaller parties to gain control of
the legislature.
   Walesa said he discussed German-Polish relations with Bluem. The
50th anniversary of the Nazi invasion of Poland is on Sept. 1.
   In his sermon at St. Brygida's, Rev. Henryk Jankowski called for
Polish-German reconciliation. After Mass, Bluem and Walesa addressed
a crowd of 2,500 people in the courtyard and around the church
premises.
   A band played the Polish and West German national anthems.
   ``You (Poles) can be proud of our nation because man does not
live only on bread. The Gdansk shipyard and Lech Walesa are
connected with the notion of freedom. You can be proud of it,''
Bluem told the crowd.
   ``I hope your premier can prove he can make a better country than
the Communists,'' Bluem said.
   He also appealed for forgiveness from the Poles.
   ``A nation without history is a people without memory. We must
not forget about suffering. We beg you for forgiveness. Let us
embrace you... No more war, no more violence, no more exile,'' he
said.
   The Solidarity leader is planning to travel to West Germany Sept.
5-8 at the invitation of the Federation of West German Trade Unions.

   Israeli jets bombed a pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem stronghold in southeast Lebanon Sunday, killing one guerrilla
and wounding five others, police reported.
   The fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, said a a statement
that its main base in the village of Ein Abu-Suar ``sustained
extensive damage'' in the attack at sundown.
   In Jerusalem, military officials reported destroying the
Hezbollah stronghold and said all Israeli planes returned safely.
   The Hezbollah statement said ``there were material and human
losses in the raid'' without giving specific casualty figures. But
police in Sidon, 25 miles south of Beirut, said the body of at least
one Hezbollah guerrilla and five wounded men were taken to the port
city's al-Rai Hospital.
   Ein Abu-Suar is 40 miles southeast of Beirut near the northern
edge of Israel's self-designated ``security zone'' in south Lebanon.
   The attack was Israel's ninth air raid in Lebanon this year. The
last air strike was on June 21 when Israeli jets pounded a base of
Ahmed Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, a radical Syrian-backed Palestinian group, in the village
of Naameh south of Beirut.
   Sunday's air raid is believed to come in retaliation for the Aug.
9 suicide car bomb attack carried out by the Iranian-supported
Hezbollah. That attack occurred in a south Lebanon strip of land
along the Israeli border that Israel has declared its security zone.
   Five Israeli soldiers and an allied Lebanese militiaman were
injured in the car bombing, and Israeli officials have vowed to
avenge the attack.
   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has said it carried out the
bombing to avenge Israel's kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric,
Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid. Israeli commandos seized Obeid in a
southern Lebanese village on July 28.
   Israel said it abducted Obeid in order to win the release of
three Israeli servicemen missing in Lebanon since 1986. They are
believed held by Hezbollah.
   It has offered to swap Obeid and other captive Shiites for the
three Israeli captives and all 16 foreign hostages, including eight
Americans, who are believed to be held by Hezbollah or its
affiliated groups. Hezbollah has rejected the offer.
   A pro-Iranian Shiite faction called the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth claimed on July 31 that it killed an American
hostage, Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, in retaliation for the
Obeid abduction.

   Waiters in Italian restaurants in this country
get the biggest tips from customers while those in Mexican eateries
fare the worst, the Internal Revenue Service has found.
   The average tip in Italian restaurants in 1986 was 15.8 percent,
compared with 15 percent in Chinese restaurants and 14.8 percent in
Mexican restaurants, according to an IRS study.
   On the other hand, patrons in Chinese restaurants were more
likely to leave a tip _ 90 out of every 100 did _ than in Italian
restaurants, where only 88 saw fit to leave something.
   In restaurants serving Mexican food there were 86 tips for every
100 customers.
   The study did not try to give any reason for the differences, nor
did it ask about restaurants that serve the foods of other countries.
   At least one waiter at a small Italian restaurant in Georgetown,
a popular Washington restaurant area, agreed that he got better tips
there than in other places he had worked.
   ``It's the European atmosphere,'' explained Mouez Zemni, who
comes not from Italy but from Tunisia, on the other side of the
Mediterranean.
   ``There's the European flair. People like the atmosphere and it
relaxes them. It doesn't even matter about the food. I don't like
Italian food much myself _ I think French food is much better.''
   At a bigger and pricier Italian place, the maitre d' was not so
sure about high tips.
   ``Some people come in here with a couple of kids and leave a
dollar,'' said Julio Estrada. ``About 20 to 25 percent don't leave
anything.''
   A waiter at a Mexican restaurant would not agree that his tips
were inferior.
   ``It's a matter of food and service,'' he insisted, a little
stiffly. ``If a customer gets good food and good service, he tips
well.''
   What started the IRS investigation is that waiters are required
by law to include tips in their earnings and pay income tax on them.
   ``Underreporting of tip income has long been a concern,'' Thomas
A. Thompson, an IRS researcher, wrote in his report on the situation.
   So the service hired the Survey Research Laboratory of the
University of Illinois to query its panel of nearly 13,000
households, both families and individuals. They kept records of
their tips over two-week periods between 1983 and 1986.
   ``The diary approach used in this study was adopted on the ground
that tipping information obtained from people leaving tips is likely
to be more accurate than data obtained from tip recipients,''
Thompson said.
   Before narrowing the survey down to ethnic restaurants, the study
tried other classifications, with labels that included ``family-type
restaurants'' and ``atmosphere@specialty
restaurants.'' That turned out to be too vague.
   People tipped more in restaurants that accepted credit cards and
those that served alcohol. Patronage at what the report called
``tip-type'' restaurants declined between 1983 and 1986, but tipping
stayed level. There was a shift to establishments where people do
not normally leave tips.
   ``Total eat-in and carryout occasions at hamburger, pizza and
chicken places increased from 4.06 million in 1983 to 4.77 million
in 1986, an increase of more than 17 percent,'' the study said.

   Former astronaut Alan B. Shepard was the big
draw at an auction of his boyhood home.
   ``It's a happy day,'' said the man who made the first U.S. flight
into space in 1961, as he autographed the backs of pictures and seat
panels of chairs for winning bidders Saturday.
   Someone paid $160,000 for the house, where Shepard has not lived
since he entered the U.S. Naval Academy in 1944.
   Shepard, who now lives in Texas, said his mother has purchased a
smaller home near his sister in North Carolina.
   As one of the United States' first group of astronauts, Shepard
made a 15-minute suborbital flight on May 5, 1961, becoming the
first American in space. The previous month, Yuri Gagarin of the
Soviet Union became the first man in space when he orbited the earth.
   In 1971, Shepard was the fifth person to walk on the moon.

<HEAD>Austrian Authorities Say 180 More East Germans Crossed from Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austrian officials on Sunday said about
180 East Germans had crossed the Hungarian border in a 24-hour
period, despite increased attempts by Hungarian officials to stop
them.
   In Hamburg, West Germany's Welt am Sonntag newspaper reported
that Hungarian officials told their West German counterparts that
there was rising Soviet and East German concern about the stream of
East Germans fleeing through Hungary.
   Bonn officials, meanwhile, told West German radio that Hungary
had repeated assurances that no East German now in Hungary would be
sent back against his will.
   Austrian police officials in Eisenstadt, about 10 miles north of
the border, said that new refugees were arriving despite Hungarian
attempts to keep cars with East German license plates away from the
boundary, the Austrian Press Agency reported. The officials were
quoted as saying about 180 had crossed since Saturday.
   All East German cars approaching Nagycenk, two miles east of the
border and 20 miles south of Eisenstadt, were being turned back by
police, several refugees were quoted as saying.
   East Germans frustrated with the lack of domestic political or
economic reforms and unable to emigrate legally to the West began
fleeing through Hungary into Austria early this summer. Their final
goal is West Germany, which considers them citizens.
   The border between Hungary and Austria is relatively easy to
cross. Hungary, a reform-minded Soviet bloc country, removed barbed
wire and other barriers from the border in April in a symbolic
opening to the West.
   Because Hungary is an allied Communist country, East Germans can
visit relatively easily. West German authorities estimate that more
than 5,000 have fled through Hungary since July.
   Hundreds of others refuse to leave West German diplomatic
property in Budapest unless guaranteed safe passage to the West.
Like-minded East Germans are crowding West German embassies,
consulates and missions in East Berlin and Prague, Czechoslovakia.
   Hungary, facing pressure from East Germany, tightened controls
after East Germans massed in groups of as many as 500 and stormed
border points. Authorities in Budapest announced Friday that border
guards would be bolstered by armed units of the Workers' Militia.
   But Hungary is also interested in West German support as it
strives to improve its trading status with West European countries
and seeks convertible currency to modernize its economy.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn told Hungarian TV late
Saturday his government cannot guarantee East German officials that
all those caught trying to escape through Hungary will be returned
home.
   Horn spoke after returning from Bonn, where he and Hungarian
Premier Miklos Nemeth met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. Hungary's official news agency MTI
said the talks focused on Hungarian trade ties to the European
Economic Community and on the refugee problem.
   The refugee situation has resulted in months of bad publicity for
East Germany, and Welt am Sonntag said Nemeth told West German
officials that Hungary was under increasing pressure from East
Berlin and Moscow to resolve the problem. The paper did not
elaborate.
   The newspaper said Hungarian officials estimate that about 20,000
of the 200,000 East Germans now vacationing in the country will seek
to flee to the West.
   West German officials have urged East Germany's hard-line
leadership to implement economic and political reforms to help stem
the flow of fleeing East Germans.

<TEXT>
   Security forces will begin stopping people on the
streets and checking their identification papers in a new effort to
round up dissidents, the official Beijing Daily said Sunday.
   Starting Friday, residents must carry identification papers
whenever they leave home ``to be prepared for examination,'' the
paper said. Drivers licenses also will be examined.
   ``Counter-revolutionary elements have not been thoroughly cleaned
up and motor vehicles often are used as tools of crimes,'' the paper
said. ``Therefore the martial law troops and police must, according
to the law, stengthen inspections of motor vehicles and drivers.''
   The order runs counter to a recent, although gradual, lessening
of the security presence on streets of the capital since the June
3-4 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters.
   Martial law imposed May 20 remains in effect, but most army
checkpoints on city streets have been removed. Soldiers stand guard
only around Tiananmen Square, the former center of the protests, and
at key overpasses and intersections.
   However, local authorities appear concerned that college students
and others who joined the seven weeks of demonstrations will use the
Oct. 1 anniversary of 40 years of Communist rule to stage some kind
of protest.
   Public anger over the army attack on the protesters _ in which
hundreds or perhaps thousands were killed _ remains deep, although
most people remain outwardly quiescent for fear of arrest or censure.
   Thousands of people have been arrested since the June crackdown,
some disappearing with no word to their families.
   The hard-line officials who led the crackdown have shown no sign
of easing their attacks on the ideological front.
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and Communist Party Secretary Li Ximing
instructed local officials in a series of meetings last week to keep
up the fight against ``bourgeois liberalism,'' or Western liberal
thought.
   They ordered leaders in all work units to ``mobilize the masses
to make reports and expose clues (to the identification of)
counter-revolutionary elements.
   ``The greatest danger in inspection work is to pause, to treat
big matters as small and let small matters go, to give up half
way,'' Li told one meeting, according to a Beijing Daily report.
   ``Our party and nation still face a life-and-death problem.''
   Beijing residents say there have been relatively few cases of
neighbors reporting on neighbors, as was common in the 1966-76
leftist Cultural Revolution and earlier political campaigns. They
say many work units are quietly covering for members who took part
in the protests, and even some police are reported to be dragging
their feet in making arrests.
   National party chief Jiang Zemin and Education Minister Li
Tieying showed concern about the mood on campuses by visiting
students at one of the capital's leading schools, Qinghua University.
   Sunday's national and local newspapers quoted Jiang as assuring a
group of Qinghua students in a four-hour meeting Friday that the
party's current policy of classing intellectuals among the working
class would not change. During the first decades of Communist rule,
intellectuals were not classed with workers but were instead
vilified as bourgeois.
   Jiang said most students are fervent patriots, but said they lack
political experience and too easily become conceited over their
successes and discouraged over obstacles.
   A college student interviewed recently in Beijing said the
despite the appearance of normalcy, people are scared.
   ``There's no law any more, no legal protection. They can just
come and take you away,'' said the student.
   Many say they fear the soldiers. Others fear the telephone
hotlines and the boxes in every work unit to report people to the
authorities.
   One man noted that any one could put a neighbor's name in a box
and accuse him of throwing stones at soldiers, and the police would
come to arrest him.
   He, like many other people, told of friends who were hauled away,
beaten and interrogated. ``The police beat first and ask questions
later,'' he said.
   Beijing residents also worry about the miles of footage shot
during the weeks of demonstrations by police crews and cameras
mounted on main streets. Police now are studying the film, and many
people wonder if their faces will be found.
   One elderly man, persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, was
asked by a foreigner how the police could find a single person in
Beijing's population of about 10 million.
   He waved his hand and looked away impatiently _ to show what a
silly question that was.

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city has gained national pre-eminence
in waste. No, not frivolous spending, but real human waste.
   The Environmental Protection Agency has bestowed the National
Award for Beneficial Reuse of Sludge on Austin.
   Ron Bond, acting director of the city's Wastewater Treatment
Department, said last week: ``It may be sludge to you, but it's our
bread and butter. It's a resource.''
   Through a complicated _ and smelly _ scientific process, Austin
turns its 250 tons of sludge per month into fertilizer for city park
grass and crops that feed cattle.
   The city also turns human waste into compost, which has been
dubbed ``Dillo Dirt'' to entice residents to pay for something they
flushed down the toilet three months ago.
   Bond said Dillo Dirt was selected because ``calling it Human
Doo-Doo wouldn't have been too appetizing.'' Dillo is short for
armadillo, in honor of the critters that proliferate in the Texas
countryside.
   Bond credits engineer Jim Doersam as the person ``most
responsible for the success'' of the Dillo Dirt program.
   Doersam said the EPA award shows Austin has turned a nasty
situation around. For 30 years, the city disposed of its sludge in
large lagoons. By the early part of this decade, Austin was
knee-deep in something, and it wasn't civic pride.
   ``You can only put so much sludge in a pond before it comes back
to haunt you _ which it did,'' he said.
   Doersam, who friends call ``The Sludge Guru,'' says he's thrilled
about the EPA award and thinks the Chamber of Commerce might have
something new to brag about.
   ``This will attract a lot of visitors!'' he said.

   She described winning for a third time as ``overwhelming.''
   ``I really didn't think I was going to win it today,'' Ms.

<HEAD>Hurricane Weakens to Tropical Storm Over Baja Mountains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hurricane Kiko pounded the Baja California
peninsula early Sunday, wrecking about 20 homes and forcing more
than 1,000 people to evacuate before weakening to a tropical storm,
officials said.
   The storm struck the tip of the peninsula at midnight Saturday
with 115-mph winds and heavy rains. However, it began weakening as
it hit coastal cliffs and moved over the mountainous terrain.
   The storm was expected to keep fading, the National Weather
Service in Miami said Sunday. It was downgraded to a tropical storm.
   Kiko's maximum sustained winds had fallen to 60 mph by 11 a.m. (2
p.m. EDT). It was located at latitude 24.0 north and longitude 110.4
west near La Paz, about 760 miles south of San Diego, and it was
expected to remain mostly stationary for 12 to 24 hours, the weather
service said.
   About 160,000 people live in La Paz, the capital of the state of
Baja California Sur.
   About 1,300 people, mostly from La Paz, were evacuated into
shelters statewide as a precautionary measure, said Lt. Ignacio
Cortez Telechea, assistant state government director, by telephone
Sunday from the capital.
   He said airports and ports remained closed and there were no
flights or ferry service.
   Hurricane warnings were discontinued, but tropical storm warnings
remained in effect on the Gulf of California side of the peninsula
from the southern tip to Bahia Concepcion, 200 miles north of La
Paz, and on the Pacific side south of San Carlos.
   The storm hit La Rivera, a town of about 4,000 people 75 miles
south of La Paz, first and hardest. Officials said about 20 homes
were destroyed there.
   ``There were homes of thin wood and laminated cardboard that blew
down,'' Cortez said. ``They had palm or cardboard roofs that blew
away. Trees, antennas, electrical poles fell.''
   No one was injured, he said.
   Other small towns south of La Paz were also hit by heavy rains
and flash floods, officials said.
   Electricity was knocked out from Cabo San Lucas, at the tip of
the peninsula, up the coast to towns south of La Paz. The power
failures meant electric pumps that provide water service were also
out.

   It's a bug-eat-bug world for Jack Blehm
and son.
   Jack and Jake Blehm breed good insects to eat bad insects at
Rincon Vitova, one of a group of 15 ``insectaria'' nationwide. Every
day, Rincon produces more than 80 million voracious critters from
ladybugs to wasps.
   Business at Rincon Vitova has tripled in the past five years as
farmers concerned about the effects of pesticides are turning to
natural alternatives.
   In 1988 alone, the Blehms say, they supplied millions of dollars
worth of natural predators to customers across three continents.
   The 15 insectaria have sales totaling $25 million annually, the
Blehms estimate.
   Most insects are sold to cotton and vegetable growers, plus back
yard farmers.
   Some colleges and universities are adding classes on integrated
pest management _ ways of holding down troublesome pests while
minimizing the use of pesticides. The Association of Applied Insect
Ecologists, a trade group, is producing a video that shows farmers
how to work with beneficial insects.
   ``This is the future,'' added Ken Hagen, a professor of
entomology at the University of California, Berkeley. ``There is a
great need. The farmers are desperate.''
   State agriculture officials estimate less than 10 percent of the
Golden State's growers use the method. Controlling pests with
beneficial insects takes longer. And because pesticides kill good
bugs along with bad, farmers are forced to stop chemical spraying
while waiting for the good bugs to do their duty.
   ``The hardest thing for the farmer is to have enough faith,''
Jake Blehm said. ``He's not used to seeing pests in the field; he's
used to a quick knockdown.
   ``With this method, you have to watch for several weeks before
you see a difference. And at the beginning, all the farmer sees is
that his crop is contaminated with bugs.''
   Rincon Vitova sells 15 species including beetles, mites and
parasitic wasps that help control flies around chickens and cattle.
   Jack Blehm, a licensed pest control adviser, provided the
business and production expertise. His partner, E.J. Dietrick, an
entomologist formerly with the biological control division at UC
Riverside, provided the field know-how.
   The company employs about 40 workers during peak season from
April to September. The insects are grown in a series of former ship
cargo containers.
   Rincon Vitova even sells bugs to movie makers. Last summer, a
studio filming a horror movie placed a request for four gallons of
maggots. ``We shipped them Federal Express to their location site in
Montana,'' Jake Blehm said.
   More than 600 species of beneficial insects have been introduced
into American agriculture in the past 100 years to curb pest
populations, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which
must approve the insects for use before insectaria start breeding
and releasing them.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panamanian government, which has
resisted every U.S. attempt to oust de facto ruler Manuel Antonio
Noriega, is making new claims that Washington is preparing to invade.
   Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter said Saturday there is a ``true
danger'' of a U.S. invasion to oust Noriega, who heads Panama's
Defense Forces.
   Speaking to reporters, Ritter said the United States has used
military maneuvers allowed under the 1977 Panama Canal Treaties to
shield its preparations.
   ``If all the preliminary steps to an invasion have been taken,
the only thing left is the definitive step,'' he said without
elaborating.
   The United States has been trying to dislodge Noriega for 18
months. It has indicted the general for drug trafficking, slapped
crippling economic sanctions on Panama, and tried to muster
diplomatic support from other Latin American countries.
   ``The U.S. pressures will continue,'' said an embassy official on
condition of anonymity. ``There can be no accommodation with a
regime that includes Noriega.''
   The United States has frozen Panamanian government assets in U.S.
banks and withheld more than $300 million in Panama Canal funds. The
Panamanian government now has trouble meeting payrolls, unemployment
is more than 20 percent, and economic activity has fallen by nearly
a third.
   ``This is a government that survives by lurching from one payday
to the next,'' said one American source.
   In addition, Noriega's domestic opponents have mounted general
strikes and huge demonstrations. International observers say the
opposition beat Noriega's candidate in May presidential elections
that Noriega annuled.
   Despite the pressure, Noriega has remained in power and even
scored some diplomatic victories.
   Last week, the Organization of American States blamed the United
States for the lack of progress in its negotiations on a Sept. 1
change of government. The organization did not even mention Noriega
by name.
   The defiant general survived a March coup and purged the Defense
Forces of disloyal elements. He has wrapped himself in a nationalist
banner and profited from the strong Latin American aversion to
anything that smacks of outside interference _ especially from the
United States.
   On Saturday, the government took the offensive against its
domestic opponents, closing three opposition party newspapers. It
also said it will arrest their editors and confiscate equipment used
to publish them.
   All the papers have called for Noriega's ouster.
   The big question is what the United States will do now.
   According to Noriega, the attempt to oust him is a thinly
disguised plot for the United States to renege on the 1977 treaties
that turn the Panana Canal over to Panama at the end of the century.
   If anything, the 51-year-old general appeared more relaxed than
ever when he showed up for an agricultural fair on a military base
about 80 miles southwest of Panama City last week. Dressed in
civilian clothes, Noriega drank beer with fairgoers and strolled
around, greeting crowds of well-wishers.
   His power base is the Defense Forces, which controls everything
from traffic to city police to customs. It even acts as local
government in many small towns, dispensing municipal largesse such
as roads and other public works projects.
   The 14,000-man Defense Forces is the only armed Panamanian
authority in the country.
   The United States, which has said all options are on the table
when it comes to removing Noriega, has about 12,000 troops in Panama
under the canal treaties. Gen. Marc Cisneros, head of the U.S.
Southern Command, has said he favors military action against Noriega
and he has stepped up the pace of military maneuvers.
   ``We will continue to reaffirm our rights under the terms of the
Canal Treaties and to defend U.S. lives and property and let the
chips fall where they may,'' said U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of
Mission John Maisto in an interview.
   Several times in the past few months, Panamanian and U.S.
soldiers have pointed weapons at each other, alleging violations of
the treaties.
   ``I would not discount a desperate suicide action by Cisneros
before Sept. 1,'' Defense Forces spokesman Maj. Edgardo Lopez
Grimaldo said in an interview. ``It could be a military invasion or
a terrorist act.''
   The Noriega-controlled government is expected to form a junta to
take over Sept. 1, the date the constitution says a new president
should take office.
   The opposition, in what Noriega called a ``historic stupidity,''
has refused to take part in any junta, demanding Noriega's departure
and recognition that it won the May 7 elections.

<TEXT>
   Two British men hiking in Pakistan's
rugged Karakorum Mountain range spotted a low-flying aircraft near
the area where a passenger plane disappeared, an airline spokeswoman
said Sunday.
   The Pakistan International Airlines twin-engine Fokker-27 with 54
people on board has been missing since early Friday, when it took
off from the northern mountain village of Gilgit for Islamabad, 175
miles south.
   Kevin Edwards and Steven Hall, the trekkers, arrived in Gilgit
early Sunday and told of seeing a low-flying plane near the
26,606-foot Naked Mountain on Friday, said airline spokeswoman Azra
Sultan.
   ``We have been following a lot of leads but this looks the most
promising,'' she said. ``Naked Mountain is the highest mountain in
the Karakorum range. It's the one climbers go out to conquer.''
   The airline's Cpt. Qasim Hyatt said that if weather permits
Monday, helicopters will drop five people, including the two
mountain climbers, on a glacier about 16,000 feet up Naked Mountain.
Aircraft have been scanning the mountain range for the past 72 hours.
   The airline said Paul McGorrian, a freelance jounalist from St.
Petersburg, Fla., was aboard the aircraft, which was carrying 49
passengers and five crew members.
   Airline chairman Daoud Pota told a news conference investigators
have not ruled out sabotage or a hijacking, but he said both appear
unlikely.
   The 27-year-old plane was equipped with an emergency locator
transmitter but it has to be activated manually by survivors. No
signals have been picked up in the area, said Pota.
   None of PIA's fleet of 11 Fokker-27s is equipped with an
automatic locator, he said.
   Deteriorating weather hampered search efforts Sunday. A thick
cloud cover blanketed the valleys of the Karakorum, said airline
spokesman A.H. Sarooqi.
   ``We have seen many a tragedy in this area, both for PIA and the
military,'' he said. Four aircraft _ a Fokker-27, a DC-3 and two
military C-130s _ have crashed in the area since 1963.
   ``It's very treacherous and inhospitable terrain,'' said Pota.

   Organizers of the Miss U.S.S.R. pageant have threatened to strip
her of the title and send another contestant to the Miss World
contest if she doesn't knuckle under to their contract demands,
which 17-year-old Yulia Sukhanova termed ``bondage.''
   ``In three months of torment I have lived through so many
humiliations, disappointments and accusations that I'm simply amazed
I haven't lost my mind,'' Miss Sukhanova, of Moscow, said in a
letter published Sunday in the newspaper Sovietskaya Rossiya.
   Miss Sukhanova said the director of the Venets organization
refused to allow her to bring a chaperone on any travels abroad with
him because he wanted to be alone with her. She also accused him of
blocking business offers from the West from reaching her, and of
sabotaging the one deal she managed to put together herself.
   Miss Sukhanova, who said she wants a career in advertising, was
chosen as the first Miss U.S.S.R. from among 35 contestants by a
panel of judges and by a television audience, which voted by
telephone.
   Before the pageant's final on May 21, the Venets organization
`insisted, by way of threats and blackmail, that the girls sign an
agreement of bondage, limiting their rights and legal
capabilities,'' Miss Sukhanova wrote.
   Some of the contestants refused to sign, but she did, she said.
   However, after she won, Miss Sukhanova and her mother went to
Venets director Yuri S. Kushnerev and said the contract was invalid
because she is a minor.
   They offered to negotiate a new contract under which her mother
and a long-time acquaintance would travel with her until she reaches
18. She accused Kushnerev of rejecting that proposal because he was
interested in making unescorted trips with the pageant contestants.
   Miss Sukhanova accused Kushnerev of blocking any business or
travel proposals from reaching her while he was negotiating in the
United States on her behalf.
   At the same time, she charged, ``he constantly told me and my
family that there was no interest in me among Western agencies, and
that I wouldn't go anywhere at all if I didn't sign the contract
with him.''
   Miss Sukhanova said she did manage to find another outlet to the
West, through the Moscow Cultural Fund, and signed a five-year
agreement with an unidentified American company on July 7.
   She was preparing to leave for the United States on Aug. 13 when
Kushnerev through his lawyer ``openly promised to use all his
contacts all the way to the Communist Party Central Committee to
make sure I would never go anywhere.''
   The Moscow Cultural Fund hastily retreated and the trip to the
United States is off, she said.
   She appealed to the newspaper for help.
   The Soviet Union for decades has frowned on beauty contests as an
example of the West's exploitation of women. But reforms instituted
by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev have opened the way for more
diversity, and that has included the establishment of several beauty
contestants.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Defends Dropping Hard-liners As Debate Opens</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on
Sunday opened a parliamentary debate on his proposed Cabinet by
defending his decision to drop religious hard-liners.
   He asked parliament deputies to fairly evaluate the technocrats
he has nominated. Earlier reports said 138 of 270 deputies had
petitioned Rafsanjani to keep Interior Minister Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, who leads the hard-line faction.
   The debate in the Majlis, or parliament, was expected to end
Tuesday with a secret ballot on each of Rafsanjani's candidates. A
majority vote is needed on each of the 22 nominees.
   Tehran Radio reported that Rafsanjani made an hourlong speech
Sunday in defense of ousting the hard-liners, who also included
Prime Minister Hussein Musavi.
   The hard-liners favor a state-controlled economy. They also
believe that by confronting the West, the government feeds Islamic
fervor and remains loyal to the policy of its founder, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, who died on June 3.
   Mohtashemi helped establish Hezbollah, or Party of God, among
young Shiite Moslem militants in Lebanon. The group now is believed
to be an umbrella for extremists holding most of the 16 Western
hostages in Lebanon.
   As leader of the so-called pragmatists, Rafsanjani is seeking to
restore ties with the West to ensure a flow of foreign technology
and financing badly needed to rebuild the country's economy. He also
wants to boost the private sector to help Iran recover from eight
years of war with Iraq that ended last year.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Rafsanjani as saying
he looked forward to ``a fair, non-aligned assessment'' of his
proposed Cabinet.
   ``I feel very proud in front of God that I have succeeded,
despite the pressures and propaganda, to ... present to you what I
think is in favor of the country, the revolution and Islam,'' he
said.
   In addition to Rafsanjani, 20 deputies were expected to make
comments on the nominees.
   The proposed Cabinet, which includes several young intellectuals,
has nine newcomers.
   Nine other nominees are already serving in the Cabinet. The rest
worked for previous governments after the 1979 Islamic revolution
ended 2,500 years of monarchy.
   The English-language Tehran Times newspaper, which backs
Rafsanjani, said in an editorial Sunday: ``It is almost certain that
the 22-member Cabinet proposed by Mr. Rafsanjani will receive a vote
of confidence from the Majlis.''
   In his speech, Rafsanjani made reference to support for
Mohtashemi. He appealed that the deputies ``not be carried away by
the poisonous propaganda of the enemies,'' and he added, ``Mr.
Mohtashemi is one of my closest friends and I have known him for
very many years.''
   However, he said he believed his nominee for interior minister,
Nateq Nouri, is ``best for this job.''
   Nouri served as interior minister from 1981-1985.
   Defending the newcomers against criticism that they lack
political experience, the 55-year-old president said: ``With my
presence, the Cabinet would be political enough.''

   A $70 million floating luxury
hotel that failed to draw tourists on Australia's Great Barrier Reef
has arrived in Vietnam, where it will reopen on the Saigon River.
   Thousands of residents lined the river Sunday to await the
arrival of the six-story, 200-room hotel, which officials hope will
help Ho Chi Minh City attract foreign businessmen, investors and
tourists.
   But its arrival was delayed until Monday when the 1,700-ton
Saigon Floating Hotel, as it is now called, broke its tow lines soon
after arriving in Saigon River and tug boats had to chase it down.
   The hotel, to open in October, is regarded as a symbol of the
city's re-emerging spirit after the drab years of economic hardship
and tight political control that followed the Communist victory in
1975.
   The Saigon Floating Hotel is the first of several joint ventures
in Vietnam by Ho Chi Minh City, the Japanese hotel and resort
developer EIE International, and Milcon Gulf, a Middle East
investment company.

<HEAD>Wreckage of 23-Year-Old Air India Crash Found on Mountain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COURMAYEUR, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-three years ago, an Air India
jetliner bound for New York with 117 people aboard slammed into
Europe's second highest mountain, killing everyone aboard, including
a noted nuclear physicist.
   A search at the time found part of one wing and a piece of
fuselage but not the flight recorder, and the cause of the crash
remains a mystery.
   On Friday, a guide climbing on Mount Blanc's Miage Glacier found
more of the wreckage, prompting police to return to the mountain for
another look.
   Italian newspapers said Sunday that the mountain guide, Renzino
Cosson, found pieces of the plane's fuselage as well as clothing,
shoes and a bag inscribed with the words ``Fly India.''
   Cosson was searching at the time for objects that might help
identify three mountain climbers whose bodies were found in the ice
two weeks ago. He said the climbers may have been killed by an
avalanche more than 30 years ago.
   ``I am convinced that next summer we will find much more
material. The glacier at this point is like the mouth of a river,''
said Cosson.
   ``It would be useless to search now. It is necessary to wait
until the black box, if it still exists, emerges from the ice,'' he
said, referring to the device that records flight information.
   Nevertheless, police said they would climb the mountain Sunday,
examine the wreckage and determine if they can recover some of the
victims' remains.
   The Boeing 707 slammed into the side of Mount Blanc, which
straddles the French-Italian border, on the Jan. 24, 1966.
   The victims included physicist Homi Jehangir Bhabab, head of the
Indian Atomic Energy Commission. It is not known if Americans were
aboard.
   The flight to New York originated in Bombay and included stops in
New Dehli, Beirut, Geneva and London.
   The plane crashed into the French side of the mountain at the
15,344-foot level just 30 minutes before its scheduled landing in
Geneva and two minutes after the pilot was given permission to
descend to 18,700 feet.
   The pieces of wreckage Cosson found Friday had been carried by
the glacier to the 8,530-foot level of the the Italian side of the
mountain.
   The accident may have been caused by a fault in the plane's
altimeter or an error by the pilot who was beginning his descent for
a landing at Geneva.

   Attackers on Sunday ambushed and
killed a former president of the state railroad who resigned in a
corruption scandal, and authorities blamed organized crime for the
assassination.
   Investigators said two or three gunmen killed Lodovico Ligato in
the driveway of his seaside home in this provincial capital in
southern Italy.
   Investigators said the killing was apparently the work of the
'ndrangheta, an organized crime group in Calabria. So far this year,
officials say there have been 95 'ndrangheta killings in the
province, including 35 in Reggio Di Calabria, a city of about 90,000
people.
   Chief investigator Federico Strano said it was too early to speak
with certainty about the motive.
   Ligato, 50, was a lawyer, journalist and former Christian
Democratic member of Parliament. He resigned from the state railroad
in November during a bidding scandal in which a $120-million
contract to supply disposable sheets for sleeping berths was
allegedly steered to one company.
   He has denied wrongdoing, but he said in his letter of
resignation that the criminal investigation was one of the reasons
he was resigning.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet envoy on a Lebanese peace mission
has proposed that Syria and Israel both withdraw soldiers from
Lebanon and a presidential election be held, Arab diplomatic sources
said Sunday.
   Envoy Gennady Tarasov has been trying to sell his proposal during
talks in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria, a key Soviet ally, the sources
said.
   His talks represented one of several diplomatic efforts under way
Sunday to end months of fierce fighting between Christians and
Syrian forces.
   On Sunday, Beirut gun battles between Christian army units and
Syrian forces allied with Moslem militias flamed anew. Sixteen
people were reported injured.
   The latest casualties raised the toll to at least 796 killed and
2,247 wounded since the latest round of the 14-year-old civil war
broke out March 8.
   In another development, a radical Iranian newspaper said Pope
John Paul II should not visit Lebanon because he would offend
Moslems. Lebanon's Maronite Catholic leader said such a visit could
prove helpful to Moslems and Catholics.
   Tarasov arrived in Amman, Jordan, on Sunday on the Soviet mission
aimed at a Lebanese truce.
   At the same time, Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa of Syria
wound up meetings on Lebanon with Jordanian officials.
   Syrian troops in Lebanon, who number about 40,000, were sent
under terms of a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   The Arab diplomatic sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Tarasov was seeking a compromise that would allow the Arab
League to reactivate a stalemated peace effort.
   Under his formula, Syrian forces would pull out of Moslem west
Beirut and the central mountains to the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon
while a presidential election in Lebanon was arranged to end a
year-old political deadlock, the sources reported. Syrian troops
control most of the country outside the Christian sector.
   ``Tarasov is suggesting a compromise under which the Syrian
pullback would be tied to an Israeli pullout from a border enclave
in south Lebanon,'' one source said.
   The Israeli army has occupied a self-declared ``security zone''
in south Lebanon since Israel withdrew most of its forces in
mid-1985, three years after invading Lebanon.
   The diplomatic source said Tarasov has received ``encouraging
responses'' from Christian army commander Michel Aoun and other
involved parties, but that the Soviets will ask the United States to
pressure Israel to agree to the plan.
   Aoun, who has vowed to force the Syrians out of Lebanon, was
named head of an interim cabinet by outgoing President Amin Gemayel
in September. A deadlock between Moslem and Christian politicans
blocked election of a successor by lawmakers.
   Aoun now is vying for power with a Syrian-backed Moslem
government headed by acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   In still another peace effort, King Hussein of Jordan flew into
Cairo, Egypt, on Sunday for an afternoon of talks dealing with
Lebanon and other regional issues. The Egyptian government's Middle
East News Agency said the monarch immediately began meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak.
   The Tehran-based newspaper Jomhuri Islami was quoted as saying if
the pope visits Lebanon, he would be supporting Aoun.
   The Roman Catholic leader said last week he would like to
undertake a peace mission to Lebanon, but no date has been set. The
Vatican has said a final decision will depend on security conditions
in Beirut.
   The French government said it sent its six warships, led by the
aircraft carrier Foch, to evacuate 7,000 French citizens if the
situation worsens.
   In Paris, the navy announced Sunday that a French helicopter
crashed near the Foch during a routine flight and the two crewmen
were missing. It said the cause of Saturday's crash was unknown.

   About 1,000 Vietnamese refugees angry about how
food was being distributed to them hurled stones at police Sunday
during a riot that left 23 people injured, authorities said.
   Police said they used tear gas to disperse the refugees.
   A police statement said the violence stemmed from a dispute over
the distribution of rice to the boat people on the outlying island
of Tai A Chau, but it gave no details.
   Authorities said about 1,000 of the refugees, some armed with
metal bars, gathered on the pier and began throwing stones at
police. Police fired 40 rounds of tear gas before the riot ended.
   No one was arrested, and there was no breakdown of who was
injured.
   About 5,000 Vietnamese boat people are staying temporarily on the
island. They are waiting to be put in detention centers.
   Under a policy adopted in June 1988, the boat people are granted
refugee status and resettled overseas only if they can prove they
fled political persecution in Vietnam. Otherwise, they would be
considered illegal immigrants and face repatriation.
   About 55,000 Vietnamese are staying in Hong Kong. Two-thirds are
living in detention camps waiting to be screened.
   Last month, about 200 Vietnamese at Sek Kong Camp hurled stones
at police who were trying to prevent them from escaping.
   Earlier this month, a fight broke out among Vietnamese refugees
at another detention center, injuring 17 people.
   Also in early August, 200 Vietnamese detainees from two rival
groups threw stones at each other.

<TEXT>
   Sinhalese radicals called Sunday for a
weeklong strike against the government, ignoring a peace appeal by
major opposition groups.
   Posters put up in Colombo by the radicals said the strike was to
protest alleged genocide by the government. The posters, in the
Sinhalese language, asked people to stay indoors and not open shops
and businesses starting Monday.
   Other posters, believed to have been put up by pro-government
groups, said anyone who heeded the strike call would be treated as a
traitor.
   On Saturday, five major opposition parties appealed to the
government and the radicals to end their bloody war.
   ``Fear stalks every home and peace is a thing of the past,'' a
statement issued by the parties said. ``Despair, gloom and fear
pervades the entire country. The slaughter, disappearances and
arrests of our citizens and the escalation of crime have become a
way of life.''
   The statement demanded the establishment of a provisional
all-party government that would include the radicals and holding of
new elections.
   There has been no response from the government of President
Ranasinghe Premadasa, who was elected in December. His United
National Party won a majority in parliamentary polls held in
February.
   At least 5,000 people have been killed in the 2-year-old campaign
by Sinhalese ultranationalists, and officials say 1,130 of the
killings have taken place in the last six weeks. There has been no
explanation for the spurt of violence.
   Human rights organizations and opposition politicians say many of
the victims have been suspected radicals shot after capture by
security forces. In past weeks, military officials have reported
scores of unidentified bodies turning up in various parts of the
island every day.
   Sinhalese radicals began fighting the Sinhalese-dominated
government after a July 1987 peace accord with Tamil militants
fighting for an independent nation in the north and east.
   The radicals say the agreement gave too many concessions to the
minority Tamils and infringed on Sri Lanka's sovereignity by
inviting Indian soldiers to implement it.
   India, the dominant military power in the region, sponsored the
agreement and moved in troops because of the sympathies of its own
60 million Tamils to the rebel cause. But it got bogged down in
fighting the rebels it once supported after a major Tamil militia
rejected the peace plan.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, have
died since Tamil militants launched their separatist war in 1983.
   In the latest violence, military officials said five people were
killed Saturday when unidentified gunmen ambushed a convoy of Sri
Lankan and Indian soldiers near the town of Vavuniya, 135 miles
north of Colombo. The officials said they were unsure who was
responsible for the attack.
   The victims included four Sri Lankans and an Indian soldier, said
the officials, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
complain of discrimination by the Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent
of the population and control the government and the military.

<HEAD>Angolan Rebel Meets South African Leader; Willing to Resume Peace

<TEXT>
   Angolan guerrilla leader Jonas
Savimbi, who canceled a cease-fire in Angola's civil war last week,
softened his stance after talks Sunday with South African leader
F.W. de Klerk.
   Savimbi said his rebel National Union for the Total Independence
of Angola still is committed to peace in Angola and promised he will
attend an African summit to put the fractured peace process back on
track in Zaire next month.
   On Thursday, Savimbi said a 2-month-old cease-fire has failed and
ordered his fighters to resume their 14-year war against Angola's
Marxist government.
   But after meeting de Klerk, Savimbi said in a statement:
   ``We welcome the prospect of resuming talks with the (Angolan
government) at the earliest possible opportunity. (We) commit
ourselves again to the effort to achieve peace and national
reconciliation.''
   The statement did not say the guerrillas will observe the
cease-fire.
   Angola's government and the guerrillas repeatedly have accused
each other of violating the cease-fire and reported heavy fighting
recently.
   Savimbi said the truce and subsequent peace negotiations are
failing because some African leaders misinterpreted a June 22
cease-fire agreement reached in Zaire.
   Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, present at the Zaire talks and
a related summit in Zimbabwe last week, said Savimbi agreed to go
into temporary exile and that his troops would be integrated into
Angola's existing one-party structure.
   Savimbi says he never agreed to leave, but he would consider
temporary retirement inside the country if he could later contest
open elections.
   The rebels have been at war for a share in government since
Portuguese colonizers hastily withdrew from the country in 1975,
leaving rival groups to fight it out for power. The Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola, now led by President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, won.
   ``The statement issued by President Kaunda ... about the content
of the agreements reached (in Zaire) ... is misleading and
destructive to the prospect of peace and democratic
self-determination in Angola,'' Savimbi said.
   The agreements set general guidelines for ending the Angolan war
but made no mention of Savimbi's future role.
   Savimbi said there were no secret accords and that Kaunda, a
strong supporter of the Angolan government, is attempting to
``redefine history.''
   Kaunda ``has succeeded in doing no more than embarrassing his
friends and risking the fragile peace,'' Savimbi said.
   De Klerk is to meet Kaunda in Zambia on Monday to discuss Angola
and other regional issues. On Friday, de Klerk met in Zaire with
President Mobutu Sese Seko and the two agreed to mediate between the
warring Angolans.
   South Africa supported Savimbi until a regional peace treaty in
December with Angola, which also calls for a phased withdrawal of
Cuba's 50,000 soldiers from Angola.
   Washington supplies the guerrillas with about $15 million in
annual aid.

<HEAD>Former Congressman To Be Sentenced On Perjury Conviction</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Five years after he won election to Congress,
former U.S. Rep. Pat Swindall goes before a judge Monday for
sentencing on his felony perjury conviction, and most likely will be
sent to prison.
   Swindall, 38, a two-term Republican from Atlanta's eastern
suburbs, was convicted June 20 on nine counts of perjury for lying
to a federal grand jury about his 1987 dealings with an undercover
agent posing as a drug-money launderer.
   He will be sentenced Monday by U.S. District Judge Richard C.
Freeman, who presided over Swindall's trial. Swindall faces between
10 months and five years in prison on each count _ the sentences can
run concurrently _ plus fines of up to $250,000 on each.
   The case falls under federal mandatory sentencing guidelines
which, for his crime, do not include probation. Federal probation
officials, the prosecution and Swindall's attorneys have filed
confidential recommendations with the judge, outlining the sentence
they believe is proper for Swindall under the guidelines.
   Federal probation officials and prosecutors are seeking a prison
sentence of 37 to 46 months, according to published reports.
Swindall's attorneys reportedly are suggesting that the sentencing
guidelines call for 10 to 16 months, and they are seeking a lighter
sentence than that.
   Swindall last week declined to discuss the case, saying he
preferred to wait until after sentencing to make his comments.
   In calling for the stiffer sentence, assistant U.S. attorneys
Craig A. Gillen and Thomas Bever said in a sentencing memorandum
that Swindall's suffering is of his own doing.
   ``While it is true that as a young, multimillionaire congressman
with a seemingly bright political future the defendant's descent
must have been quite painful for him and his family, it is a pain
created by his own hand,'' the prosecutors wrote.
   ``As the defendant emphasizes his status as a former public
official, one is remembered of the edict, `To those whom much is
given, much is expected.' Unlike so many others who have come before
this court for sentencing with limited economic opportunity, limited
intellectual ability and inadequate educational background, the
defendant's horizon was unlimited, bound only by the strength of his
character and moral judgment _ or lack thereof,'' the memo said.
   Swindall's attorneys used a similar argument in seeking a lighter
sentence, saying he should be spared a long prison term because he
lost his House seat, faces permanent expulsion from the state bar
and has suffered enough to ``last a lifetime.''
   Swindall was found guilty of lying to a federal grand jury
investigating a money-laundering sting operation. Evidence in his
trial showed that Swindall repeatedly talked with the undercover
agent and a political associate while he was seeking $850,000 to
finish his luxurious Stone Mountain home, even after a time when he
told the grand jury he had ``walked away'' from the proposed deal.
   Swindall ultimately accepted and endorsed a $150,000 check before
backing out of the deal.
   The jury found Swindall guilty of telling 18 deliberate, willful
lies in his grand jury testimony.
   Swindall was largely unknown politically before he won the 4th
Congressional District seat in 1984, upsetting veteran Democrat
Elliott Levitas. He was re-elected in 1986, but lost the seat in
1988 to Democrat Ben Jones while under the cloud of his perjury
indictment.
   Swindall sought a speedy trial before the 1988 election in hopes
of getting an acquittal and preserving his career, but the trial was
aborted after Swindall campaign mailings, maintaining his innocence,
reached members of the jury.

million Illinois State Lottery Lotto drawing and became the largest
single jackpot winner in the state's history, officials said Sunday.
   The winning ticket was purchased somewhere in the Chicago
metropolitan area, which includes the city and surrounding counties.
   Mike Wittkowski, a Chicago printer who was a 1984 Lotto winner,
held the previous state record of $40 million. The state's biggest
jackpot ever was $69.9 million for the April 15 drawing this year.
That prize was divided four ways.
   Nationally, the biggest single lottery winner was Sheelah Ryan of
Winter Springs, Fla., who won $55.16 million in the Florida lottery
on Sept. 3, 1988. Other jackpots have been larger, but they were
split by more than one ticket-buyer.
   The winning numbers drawn Saturday night were 6, 9, 33, 40, 51,
54. In addition to the one person who matched all six, 607 people
matched five of the six numbers for $2,164.50 and 35,677 people
matched four numbers for $73.50, said lottery spokeswoman Kathy Rem.
   The winner will receive an annual payment of about $2.1 million
for the next 20 years, with the exact amount to be determined
Monday, she said.
   Since July 29, when the jackpot was $6 million, no one has
matched all six numbers, rolling over the prize money each time to
the next week.
   Previous Lotto winners have found innovative ways of safeguarding
their tickets until they can hand them in.
   Robert Rucker, who won $2 million in 1984, said he read his
numbers a dozen times before he started jumping up and down and
crying.
   ``That's when you suddenly realize you are holding the equivalent
of a suitcase filled with millions of dollars in cash,'' he said.
``And it's strictly up to you to protect it for the next 24 to 36
hours.''
   He put it in a strongbox in his bedroom and invited friends over
to have ``strength in numbers.''
   Lottery Director Sharon Sharp said her favorite story is the
woman who stuck the ticket in her bra, ``in a plastic bag so she
wouldn't sweat on it.''

<HEAD>Police Use Birdshot On Activists; Four Youths Hurt</HEAD>

   Police fired birdshot at
anti-apartheid demonstrators Sunday, injuring four teen-age boys in
a mixed-race township outside Cape Town, witnesses said.
   The youths, all aged 16 or 17, were shot shortly after taking
part in a rally to protest Sept. 6 parliamentary elections that
exclude the 28 million black majority, the witnesses said.
   The four were not seriously injured and were treated at a nearby
hospital. Col. J.L. de Vries, the police spokesman on duty, said he
had no information about the incident.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu meanwhile urged anti-apartheid
activists to keep demonstrations peaceful, because ``we must use
methods acceptable to God.''
   ``Don't let us undermine a noble struggle by being provoked into
acts of violence,'' Tutu told about 400 people at St. George's
Church in Athlone, a mixed-race township near Cape Town. ``Our
children will die, people will be detained ... but let the violence
come from the (government) system.''
   Police and demonstrators have clashed almost daily in black and
mixed-race townships around Cape Town since leaders launched a
nationwide mass defiance campaign Aug. 2 against South Africa's
apartheid policy of legal race discrimination.
   Protesters are trying to desegregate hospitals, schools, buses,
beaches and other facilities with non-violent demonstrations.
   Organized protests have been largely peaceful. However, many
spontaneous demonstrations have erupted with youths throwing stones
at police and barricading streets with burning tires.
   Police have banned numerous rallies and detained hundreds of
activists without charge.
   Organizers announced several additional protests this week,
including a Sept. 2 march on Parliament in Cape Town. The organizers
also hinted they may call a massive worker stayaway the day before
and day of the polls.
   In other developments:
   _The country's two largest anti-apartheid labor federations vowed
Sunday to strengthen their opposition to labor laws that limit
workers' rights.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, which has over
900,000 members, and the smaller National Council of Trade Unions,
did not specify what actions they plan at the end of two days of
meetings near Johannesburg. In the past, they have organized the
work stoppages.
   _More than 1,000 people attended the funeral of Eric Gumede, the
activist killed four days after his Aug. 12 release from detention
without trial. Gumede helped organize and participated in a hunger
strike by detainees that led to the release of hundreds.
   The green, gold and black flag of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement was draped over Gumede's coffin before
he was buried in KwaMashu, a township outside the Indian Ocean city
of Durban.

   Holocaust survivors opened a public hearing
Sunday to challenge experts' findings that Nazi criminal Dr. Joseph
Mengele drowned in Brazil in 1979.
   The three-day hearing before a 10-member tribunal at Yad Vashem
Holocaust Memorial focuses on claims Mengele has been spotted
recently in places ranging from an island off the Portuguese coast
to a dental clinic in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   The proceedings also follow Jewish protests over a Roman Catholic
convent located at Auschwitz death camp in Poland, where Mengele
worked and where 2.5 million of the 6 million Jewish victims of the
Nazis died.
   Mengele, known as the ``Angel of Death,'' has been accused of
sending 400,000 people to die in gas chambers and of conducting
cruel medical experiments on twins at the camp. This week, German
prosecutors announced they are investigating new evidence suggesting
similar experiments were carried out on retarded children.
   Mengele was declared dead in June 1985 by an international team
of forensic experts who concluded ``within a reasonable scientific
certainty'' that a skeleton exhumed from a cemetery in Embu, near
Sao Paulo, was that of Mengele. Israel never accepted the findings.
   Relatives said Mengele drowned near Sao Paulo on Feb. 7, 1979,
but announced the death only in 1985 during an international
campaign to bring him to trial.
   ``There are claims that Mengele is still alive,'' said Aharon
Simcha, a retired Israeli judge heading the tribunal. ``There is a
feeling, especially among Auschwitz survivors and Mengele's victims,
that not enough is being done to bring him to trial.''
   Among those to testify is American actress Susanne Severeid, who
told reporters she saw a person who fit Mengele's description on
Puerto Santo Island near Portugal in April 1985.
   Ms. Severeid said she traveled to the island with her husband, a
former Dutch resistance fighter, after the Simon Wiesenthal Nazi War
Crimes Research Center was told Mengele might be there. She was to
testify at the hearing Tuesday.
   ``I think the body in Brazil was a hoax,'' added Ms. Severeid,
who starred in the television series ``The Paper Chase.'' ``I saw a
man who fits his profile.''
   Four Holocaust survivors also said a Brazilian dentist, Maria
Helena Bueno de Castro, says she treated Mengele in Sao Paulo about
two months after relatives announced his death. She reportedly said
the man she believed was Mengele called himself Pedro Miller.
   Before the hearing, some Auschwitz survivors held an emotional
burial ceremony for ashes of victims they brought back from a visit
to the camp last week.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms Sunday dropped heavy rain and hail as
big as baseballs on Nebraska and Kansas, while hot, humid weather
made things uncomfortable in much of the South.
   In Nebraska, the storms dumped 4 inches of rain in two hours on
Overton and nearly 2\ inches on Bertrand in the same time. Nearly 2
inches fell in Grand Island in the six hours ending at 1 p.m. CDT.
   Baseball-size hail fell south of Belleville, Kan., and
marble-size hail spattered Dorchester, Neb.
   Thunderstorms also dropped small hail and heavy rains on North
Dakota. Scattered showers and thunderstorms fell along the lower
Mississippi Valley, the southern Atlantic Coast and the Texas Coast.
One thunderstorm dumped an inch and a quarter of rain on Savannah,
Ga., in an hour.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell across New Mexico and eastern
Colorad.
   Hot and humid temperatures continued across much of the Southeast
and south central sections of the nation. Afternoon temperatures
were in the 90s from Florida and the Gulf Coast to the Tennessee
Valley, the lower Mississippi and Missouri valleys, eastern Kansas
and the southern Plains, as well as in the desert Southwest.
   In Paducah, Ky., it was 91 degrees and the humidity was 73
percent, producing a heat index of 110 and making it dangerous for
anyone involved in strenuous outdoor work or play. It was even
stickier in Ozark, Ala., where the heat index was 123.
   The mercury hit a record 97 degrees in Pensacola, Fla., snapping
the old mark set in 1947 by 1 degree.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 52
degrees in Cut Bank, Mont., to 101 degrees in Beeville, Texas. The
low in the lower 48 states was 29 degrees in Truckee, Calif.
   The forecast for Monday called for showers and thunderstorms
stretching from the eastern half of the Gulf Coast and Florida to
the Appalachians, the Tennessee and Ohio Valleys, the Great Lakes
region, the upper and middle Mississippi Valley, much of the
northern Plains and the northern Rockies; scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the central and southern Rockies to parts of the
central Plains.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 80s across much of the
nation, the 70s from Washington state to the northern Rockies and
western North Dakota, as well as the upper Mississippi Valley to the
upper Great Lakes, and from northeast New York to New England; in
the 90s from the southern Atlantic Coast to the Gulf Coast, the
Tennessee Valley, the lower Mississippi and Missouri valleys and the
southern Plains; near 100 degrees in northern and central Texas; and
from 90 and 105 degrees from the desert Southwest to the inland
valleys of California and southern Oregon.

<HEAD>Thousands Celebrate Anniversary of First Battle for Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people rallied Sunday to
celebrate the 23rd anniversary of a guerrilla movement's armed
struggle against South African rule in Namibia.
   ``It has been a bitter war with thousands of young lives lost,''
Nahas Angula, chief education officer of the South-West Africa
People's Organization, told several thousand people outside
Windhoek, the capital. ``But at the end we can see the light of
freedom emerging.''
   Guerrillas of the independence movement launched their first
attack against the South African-led security forces on Aug. 26,
1966, in the northern town of Omgulumbashe. The movement is now
favored to become Namibia's first independent government.
   The movement held a rally Saturday in Omgulumbashe and another
Sunday in Katatura, the black township outside Windhoek.
   More than 20,000 people, mostly guerrillas, were killed in the
bush war. The black nationalist fighters never were able to maintain
bases in Namibia and suffered about 10 casualties for every one
inflicted upon the security forces.
   ``When we started the armed struggle, all the odds were against
us,'' said Angula.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since 1915, agreed in
December to relinquish control of the territory under a regional
peace accord signed with Angola and its Cuban allies. The accord
calls for Cuba to conduct a phased withdrawal of its 50,000 soldiers
from Angola.
   South Africa has been implementing a yearlong independence plan
for Namibia under U.N. supervision. Elections are planned for
November and independence is expected early next year.
   The guerrilla movement is favored to win the elections.

Perez praised the outgoing Cabinet but said changes were ``usual''
after six months in power.
   It was the first Cabinet reorganization since he was inaugurated
on Feb. 2.
   The new foreign minister, Reinaldo Figueredo, replaces Enrique
Tejera Paris. In other changes, Raul de Armas became the new
agriculture minister, Elias Osuna transport minister, Manuel
Adrianza health minister, Jesuus Ramoon Carmona chief of staff,
German Lairet labor minister and Marisela Padron family minister.
   All other Cabinet ministers stayed on, including Planning
Minister Miguel Rodriguez, the architect of the governent's economic
policy.
   The new ministers were sworn in as the governing Democratic
Action Party held nationwide primaries to choose candidates for
December gubernatorial and municipal elections.
   The leftist Movement Towards Socialism, the second-largest
opposition party, also held primaries Sunday.
   December will mark the first time Venezuelans vote for governor
in the 22 states and federal territories. Previously, governors were
nominated by the president.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of people rallied in the
republic of Moldavia on Sunday to demand adoption of Moldavian as
the official language, organizers said.
   In the Baltics, activists responded to a Kremlin attack on their
drive for independence. On Saturday, the Communist Party Central
Committee criticized the nationalist movements as leading the region
into an ``abyss.''
   National deputies from Latvia, in a telegram to President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, said the Central Committee statement had spread
``disinformation to the population of Latvia and the world, causing
obstacles for perestroika and the republic.''
   ``We expected this,'' said Raimona Sakalouskis of Sajudis, the
Lithuanian movement.
   Nikolai Raiyulanu of the Moldavian People's Front said 250,000 to
300,000 people jammed Victory Square in the Moldavian town of
Kishinev, holding flags and banners boosting ethnic demands.
   The Soviet evening news showed a crowd overflowing in the square,
which was a sea of red, yellow and blue Moldavian flags.
   The Tass news agency said Moldavian President Mircha I. Snegur
addressed the crowd and appealed for calm discussion of a law making
Moldavian the official language, which will be considered by the
republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, on Tuesday.
   He said the proposal ``does not infringe on the rights of other
nationalities living on Moldavian territory,'' Tass reported.
   About 2,000 members of a group called Unity, which is comprised
mostly of Russians, Ukrainians and other minorities in the republic,
held a rally nearby, Raiyulanu said in a telephone interview from
Kishinev. They passed a resolution calling the proposed law a
violation of their rights, Tass said.
   Tass also said a third rally was held, this by thousands of
Gagauzi, a Christian Turkish minority group. The Gagauzi, meeting in
Komrat, also were protesting that the language law infringes on
their right and the rights of other minority groups, Tass said.
   The rallies came amid a wave of strikes at more than 100
factories and offices in Russian- and Ukrainian-dominated cities
protesting the proposed language law.
   Strikers have demanded that the Moldavian government allow more
time for discussion of the law. Its final draft version was
published in the official press on Aug. 20.
   The law would make Moldavian, a dialect of the language spoken in
neighboring Romania, the official language. It would also restore
the Latin alphabet that the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin replaced
with Cyrillic when the Soviet Union forcibly took the land from
Romania in 1940.
   Leaders of the People's Front see the adoption of the language
law as vital to protecting Moldavian culture. They are one of many
Soviet ethnic groups who have been agitating for more autonomy from
the Kremlin.
   The Moldavian activists view the language law as a first step in
a program modeled on the Baltic republics' more radical program of
political and economic autonomy.
   More than 1 million residents in those three northwestern
republics linked hands last week in a giant chain to protest a
Soviet-Nazi pact of 50 years ago that led to the Soviet annexation
of the three states. One Baltic republic, Estonia, has declared
partial sovereignty from Moscow.
   Saturday's official message from the Communist Party's
policy-making body accused ``separatist elements'' of whipping up
``nationalist hysteria'' and appealed for an end to their push for
secession.
   In its own response, the People's Front organization in Latvia
acalled for restraint among Latvians. ``Let's be united and calm,
and not give in to the provocation,'' it said.
   Sources said the Latvian Communist Party's Central Committee
would hold a special meeting on Wednesday to discuss the declaration.
   On Sunday, the national Communist Party daily Pravda said the
need for a Moldavian language law was obvious.
   However, it said the debate over the law had raised other, more
extreme demands that worried the non-Moldavian speaking minority and
prompted its protests.
   ``All the more often at rallies of the People's Front, you hear
slogans like `Moldavia for Moldavians!''' the newspaper said.
   It said some people in the Moldavian republic were even talking
of seceding from the Soviet Union.

   Police opened fire on Buddhists protesting
for greater autonomy in northeastern India on Sunday and at least
three demonstrators were killed, authorities said.
   Hundreds of Buddhists in the mountain town of Leh, 150 miles west
of Srinagar, hurled stones at police who charged the crowd and fired
tear gas to disperse protesters, local government spokesman M.S.
Pandit said.
   ``When this proved ineffective the police opened fire, killing a
young man,'' Pandit said in Srinagar, the capital of Jammu-Kashmir
state.
   A government official in Leh said on condition of anonymity that
two more people died later of gunshot wounds.
   Pandit said 15 people were injured before police started
shooting. He did not say whether others were wounded by gunfire.
   Troops in nearby garrisons were placed on alert and a curfew was
imposed soon after the incident, he said.
   Buddhists make up 85 percent of the 70,000 people in the Ladakh
region, which comprises the Leh and Kargil districts near India's
border with China. They allege discrimination by the
Moslem-dominated local government.
   Moslems are 10 percent of the population and the remaining 5
percent are Sikhs and Hindus.
   For the past 15 years, Buddhists have fought for greater autonomy
in the region, but their protests were non-violent until three
months ago. Since then, there have been frequent clashes between the
two communities.
   Sunday's deaths, however, were the first in the regional struggle.
   Earlier this month, the government advised tourists to avoid Leh,
a Buddhist religious and cultural center, after militants threw
boulders at a tourist motor convoy near the town on Aug. 8. At least
30 Western tourists were injured.

   Police wielded clubs and fired tear gas
Sunday to arrest an American and a Canadian, both Taiwanese-born
dissidents advocating Taiwan's independence from China. The two were
then deported.
   Police said Robert Tsai of Houston and Leo Yi-shih of Toronto
entered the country illegally. Police refused to say which flight
they left on.
   About 300 policemen surrounded the two men as they were driving
to speak at a seminar organized by a private law foundation in
Taipei.
   Club-wielding policemen used tear gas to disperse their
supporters, pulled Tsai and Leo out of their car, and took the two
directly to the airport.
   About 10 supporters of Tsai and Leo clashed briefly with police.
No injuries were reported.
   Taiwan has barred Tsai and Leo from returning to their native
land, saying they advocate that Taiwan no longer should claim to be
part of China.
   Promoting an independent Taiwan is considered seditious by the
Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a
civil war to Communist forces on the China mainland. It still claims
to be China's legitimate government. The Beijing government
considers Taiwan a renegade province.
   Tsai and Leo managed to return to Taiwan earlier this month to
attend an annual convention for Taiwanese living abroad.
   Police said they used false names to obtain entry visas, and the
officials ordered the two to leave before Friday or face expulsion.
Tsai and Leo said they would not leave voluntarily and wanted to
fight Taiwan's ``blacklist policy'' by staying.
   Dissidents claim about 1,000 overseas Taiwanese have been
blacklisted and prohibited from returning because they support an
independent Taiwan.
   Tsai is a central committee member of the U.S.-based World United
Formosans for Independence, and Leo is director of the U.S.-based
World Federation of Taiwanese Associations.

<HEAD>Admirers Hope to Turn Shaw's Birthplace Into Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The birthplace of Irish playwright George
Bernard Shaw is up for sale, and his admirers are trying to raise
money to turn the yellow brick rowhouse into a museum.
   Members of the Shaw Birthplace Museum Trust said Sunday they have
had talks with financial backers, whom they would not identify,
about purchasing the eight-room house where Shaw was born in 1856.
   Owners Aida and Eugene Giblin want $222,750 when the house at 33
Synge Street in south Dublin is auctioned next month. But that is
twice what the trust thinks it is worth.
   ``They're looking for quite an unrealistic figure,'' said trust
chairman Nora Lever. ``It's in a very bad state of repair.''
   Ms. Lever said the trust will make an offer for the house, but
``if that is not acceptable then we've had it, that's it, out.''
   Similar properties on the street named after another Irish
dramatist, John Millington Synge, are selling for $81,000 to
$108,000, she said.
   ``With its links to Shaw, the house has got to be worth double
the value of other houses in the street,'' Mrs. Giblin said. ``It's
a disgrace that no state agency would come up with the money. The
house should have been declared a national monument years ago.''
   Ms. Lever also criticized the lack of state funding for the house
Shaw lived in until he was 10 years old.
   The playwright, who died in 1950 at age 94, left the National
Gallery of Ireland one-third of the royalties from his published
work, she noted. The unexpected bequest was swelled by the success
of the 1964 film ``My Fair Lady,'' based on Shaw's ``Pygmalion.''
   Other famous Shaw plays include ``Man and Superman,''``Major
Barbara'' and ``Joan of Arc.''
   Shaw came to London in 1876 where he found fame and fortune as an
art, music and drama critic, playwright, commentator and social
reformer.

   President Bush showed off his old
first baseman's style Sunday, getting one hit in two at-bats and
collecting four putouts in a softball game organized by journalists
and local businessmen.
   A captain and first baseman on Yale's baseball team four decades
ago, Bush tried to live down his collegiate reputation as a
good-field, no-hit player in the two innings he played Sunday on the
side of a rump team of White House staffers against a pickup squad
of reporters, photographers and local residents.
   ``Those who said `good field, no hit,' I think it's a vicious
assault, not only on my baseball ability, but on my character,'' he
quipped.
   Bush joined the game in the second inning with the White House
team behind 7-0. He flied out to short center in his first at-bat
but hit a ground double down the first base line his second time up.
   The White House team rallied behind his play, scoring six runs to
narrow the score to 7-6. But after Bush left to go fishing, the
opposing journalists and businessmen recovered and won the game 9-6.
   Softball was one of four sports activities the vacationing
president devoted his attention to Sunday at his seaside home on
Walker's Point. Wedged between them were two church services that he
attended with his visiting houseguests, evangelist Billy Graham and
his wife.
   Originally, Bush said he was going to have what he called a
``quintathelon'' day of jogging, tennis, softball, golf and boating.
He canceled the golf, saying, ``I have a rendezvous with bluefish,''
although he has yet to catch one despite attempts daily since his
arrival Aug. 16. But he squeezed in a game of horseshoes.
   Bush introduced Graham at the tiny First Congregational Church
and noted that the minister recently returned from Eastern Europe
where he preached to 90,000 people in Budapest.
   He said Graham, like himself on his recent trip to Poland and
Hungary, has seen the ``fascinating change taking place'' as those
countries open their political and economic systems.
   At the first service, where the visit of Bush and his wife
Barbara and the Grahams was not expected, about 40 people were in
attendance in the tiny wooden church.
   Graham spoke briefly after commenting that ``One of the wonderful
things about having the president go to church is you get the press
to go to church.''
   At St. Ann's Episcopal, close to Bush's home, a packed
congregation heard Graham preach a on the prodigal son, belief in
God and other Christian themes.
   Bush, in a jovial mood, then invited the small group of reporters
and photographers who travel in his motorcades to his house to watch
his tennis match.
   Using a nickname he has given himself on the golf course and in
the horseshoe pit, he said he wanted to show reporters ``what Mr.
Smooth is like on the courts.''
   Bush and his partner, son Jeb of Florida, teamed against local
friends Spike Heminway and Andy Holden for a vigorous game of
doubles.
   The president's game, with a strong forehand and quick net play,
was peppered with a steady patter of comments such as, ``Great
return,'' ``Get in, get in'' to the ball, ``Sorry, partner,'' and
``All my fault.''
   When the press group left, the Bushes were losing, 2-3, in the
first set.
   Mrs. Bush wandered out with Billy Graham's wife, Ruth. In a
playful attempt to get back at her husband for his remark in front
of reporters who watched her play last week, she repeated his quip
then: ``It's like watching grass grow.''
   Bush accepted an invitation to a softball tournament later
involving the press corps, White House staff and local community
members before his afternoon game of golf. ``That can be my
quintathelon,'' he said.
   Bush was up early for a two-mile jog with daughter Dorothy
LeBlond, dog Millie, two reporters and a White house staff member.
   Asked outside St. Ann's how the fishing was going, he said he
remains determined to catch one. ``I will guarantee there will be
fish caught,'' he said.
   But the president came home empty-handed again.

<HEAD>Kurds Claim Tehran Agents Killed Iranian</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two gunmen killed an Iranian and seriously
wounded another in an attack that the Kurdish Communist Party of
Iran blamed Sunday on Iranian government agents.
   A police statement said Bahman Javadi, an Iranian with a Swedish
passport, died in the hospital a few hours after he was shot in the
head Saturday night in the southern Cypriot coastal resort of
Larnaca.
   Javadi, 33, was killed as he walked back to his hotel with his
mother and sister and four other Iranians, the statement said.
   One of the four, Yussef Rashidzadeh, 40, was shot in the chest
and is reported hospitalized in critical condition.
   Stelios Karayias, head of the Criminal Investigation Department,
told reporters he did not know the motive for the attack, but did
not rule out politics.
   He said police are searching for the gunmen.
   Javadi arrived in Cyprus from Sweden on Monday. Rashidzadeh
arrived from Iran the following day, accompanied by Javadi's mother
and sister. Javadi had been trying to obtain Swedish visas for them,
Karayias said.
   The Kurdish Communist Party of Iran said in a telex sent to The
Associated Press in Cyprus from Norsborg, Sweden, that Javadi was
one of its activists.
   The statement said Javadi, ``known as Gholam Keshavarz, who went
to Larnaca to meet his mother, has been shot dead there by the
agents of the Islamic Republic of Iran.''
   The Larnaca attack follows the July 14 assassination of Abdul
Rahman Qassemlou, leader of the rebel Kurdish Democratic Party of
Iran, and two other Kurds in a Vienna hotel.
   Qassemlou and the other two Kurds had been meeting with Iranian
officials to negotiate an amnesty for Kurdish rebels fighting Tehran
for an autonomous homeland in northwest Iran.
   Kurdish Democrats blamed the Iranian government for the killings.
But Iran blamed the assassinations on the Iraq-based Mujahedeen
Khalq, the main Iranian opposition movement, to prevent a
reconciliation between Tehran and the Kurds.

   U.S. Rep. Barney Frank received spirited
support as he marched in a parade Sunday, three days after admitting
to a relationship with a male prostitute who may have run a sex ring
out of his apartment.
   The parade in this working-class city 45 miles south of Boston
was part of an event named ``Fall River Celebrates America'' that
drew some 100,000 people over the weekend. On Sunday, the
celebration welcomed a fleet of tall ships to the city's port.
   While there were a few muffled boos, most of the crowd gave Frank
thumbs-up signs and cheered the Democratic congressman from
Massachusetts' 4th District as he moved through the parade route.
   Frank, who has admitted he is homosexual, said Friday that he had
once paid for sex with a male prostitute, and then hired the man,
Steve Gobie, to do household chores and run errands.
   Frank said he had hoped to reform Gobie, a felon on probation,
and wrote letters on Gobie's behalf to a Virginia probation officer.
   But Frank fired him when he became suspicious that Gobie was
selling sex from Frank's Washington apartment while the congressman
was out of town.

   More than 22,000 Mini cars pulled into Silverstone
raceway Sunday to celebrate the 30th birthday of the doughty little
auto that has barely changed in three decades.
   The box-like car provided cheap and colorful transport and became
a symbol of the Swinging '60s in its early years. It still attracts
40,000 buyers a year.
   Its manufacturer, Austin Rover, decided to hold a birthday party
with an open invitation to Mini owners worldwide.
   By midafternoon, more than 22,000 Mini drivers had responded to
the call at Silverstone near Towcester, 75 miles northwest of London.
   Among those at the party were Mini enthusiasts from the United
States and Australia and a group of 300 fans from Japan, where sales
this year are expected to exceed 8,000.
   A party of West Germans rented a North Sea ferry to ship their

   Voyager 2's close-up photos of Neptune's
moon Triton reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that erupt
explosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 miles
high, scientists said Sunday.
   ``I believe they are active,'' or erupted at least within the
past 100 years, said U.S. Geological Survey geologist Larry
Soderblom, a member of the Voyager photographic imaging team at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``There's 10 or 20 or 30 _ lots.''
   ``This is a crazy idea ... but it's the best we have at the
current time'' to explain the pockmarked terrain, he added.
   While more evidence is needed to prove the volcanoes are active,
``the whole process makes physical sense,'' said Bradford Smith,
leader of the Voyager 2 imaging team. ``That is a perfectly sensible
explanation.''
   If Soderblom and Smith are right, Triton is only the third object
in the solar system known to have active volcanism. Earth and
Jupiter's moon Io are the others.
   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes with
sulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io. But he said the volcanoes on Triton
are produced when liquid nitrogen rises in underground pools rises
to the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got to explode
and will shower ice particles and gas.''
   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to
50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated the
eruptions eject debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps faster,
sending it 12 to 19 miles skyward.
   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''
said Smith, a University of Arizona planetary scientist. The
deposits apparently contain radiation-darkened ices that fell to the
surface after being carried skyward by the blast, he added.
   Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday night
when it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole cloud
tops. Early Friday morning, the spacecraft zoomed about 24,000 miles
past Triton, taking the photos that have revealed at least three
kinds of icy volcanism on the moon.
   Voyager earlier discovered icy flows that oozed up from the
floors of long valleys, a process likened to toothpaste coming out
of a tube slit with a razor blade.
   On Friday, scientists announced that Voyager had discovered a
different type of ice volcanoes, which appeared inactive and
possibly extinct. They are huge flat craters, called calderas,
similar to the one in which Yellowstone National Park rests.
   Some calderas, such as the crater atop Hawaii's Kilauea volcano,
fill with lava lakes. Triton's calderas, measuring up to hundreds of
miles wide, fill with flows of viscous ice, possibly water ice, that
gushes up from below, Smith said.
   New evidence released Sunday shows Triton's ice-lava lakes ``can
come up and overflow. You see that happen in Hawaii all the time''
when molten rock lava overflows crater walls, Smith said.
   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced ``a sea of
ice-like lava in repeated eruptions,'' resulting in ``massive,
oceanic-scale flooding,'' Soderblom said during a Sunday news
conference. He said at least four such calderas have been spotted on
Triton.
   Soderblom said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen ice
volcanoes either are currently active or erupted within the past
century because they are located on Triton's huge south polar ice
cap.
   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So if
the ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic deposits
would have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.
   So far, Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune, in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. It
also has found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, including
two that are broad bands of dust.
   The latest ring photo released by NASA Sunday shows one of those
bands is even broader than thought, forming a beautiful, circular
sheet of dust that extends throughout the plane of Neptune's rings
and extends inward toward the planet.
   NASA's latest results from Voyager's close encounters with
Neptune and Triton found that:
   _Winds up to more than 700 mph have been measured in Neptune's
atmosphere.
   _A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours and three minutes, give or take
four minutes.
   _Neptune's south pole and equator, while incredibly cold, are
much hotter than the planet's middle latitudes.
   _The planet's magnetic poles are tilted an extreme 50 degrees
away from from the poles around which the planet rotates, a much
greater tilt than the minimum of 30 degrees scientists initially
estimated. That means Neptune's magnetic north pole is closer to its
equator than to its rotational north pole.
   It also means Neptune is much more similar to Uranus, which has a
magnetic field tilt of 58 degrees. Earth's magnetic poles are tilted
12 degrees from its true, or rotational poles.
   By 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles from
Earth and 3.19 million miles behind Neptune, speeding away from the
planet at 37,621 mph.
   The probe on Sunday was looking for lightning and auroras on
Triton. It also sent back its best picture of heart-shaped moon
1989N1, which has usurped Nereid as Neptune's second-largest moon.

<HEAD>Crack Creeps Into Chicago, Police Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crack cocaine, a common problem on the East and
West coasts, is beginning to show up more and more in the Chicago
area where until now it has been a rarity, police say.
   Authorities don't know for sure why crack _ a smokable form of
cocaine also known as rock cocaine _ had been so scarce here, but
one theory is that local drug kingpins kept it out of the area
because they feared it would cut into their profitable trafficking
in powder cocaine and heroin.
   Crack is becoming a law enforcement problem in some of the poorer
southern suburbs, and police fear poor city neighborhoods could be
the next stop for dealers. Crack dealers have invaded other urban
centers by establishing footholds first in outlying communities,
police say.
   ``It's virgin soil,'' said Maywood police Lt. Harold Jenkins.
``Dealers figure they can come here and start their own thing.''
   Los Angeles street gangs have introduced crack, which has been
associated with violence in dozens of cities, into Kansas City, Mo.,
Minneapolis and other cities, and police are checking reports that
those gangs also may be involved in Chicago's suburbs.
   A single dose of crack provides a much more intense high than
snorting powder cocaine and costs less, making it popular in poorer
communities and among the young.
   For years, Chicago police have focused their drug activities on
powder cocaine and heroin abuse. While other cities reeled under
soaring homicide rates due to crack, Chicago's homicide rate dropped
to its lowest level in 20 years in 1988.
   Officials say the full extent of crack abuse in Chicago has not
been determined. In a four-month period ending in June, police
raided 20 crack houses, said Sgt. Jim Brady.
   In suburban Harvey, 539 drug arrests were made last year and
police say 95 percent of the narcotics trade there involves crack.

   The final session of an international conference to
negotiate peace in Cambodia opens Monday, but lack of progress is to
keep some key foreign ministers away.
   Protagonists at the monthlong conference of 19 nations remained
apart on all major issues, delegates said Sunday, with the role of
the Khmer Rouge _ whose bloody 1975-1978 rule cost at least one
million lives _ at the center of debate.
   Surprise concessions in the final three days were considered
unlikely.
   In Beijing, the official Xinhua news agency reported that Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen of China, a crucial player, would attend the
closing ministerial session only ``if the four committees of the
conference can succeed in producing agreements.''
   China sponsors the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of the three
resistance movements fighting Cambodia's Vietnamese-backed
government.
   It remained unclear Sunday whether Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze would attend. The U.S. State Department announced
Friday that Secretary of State James A. Baker III would not come
because a comprehensive settlement was not in sight.
   It was uncertain whether resistance leader Prince Norodom
Sihanouk would head his delegation.
   In a surprise move, Sihanouk announced he was resigning as
president of his movement, one of three parties within the
resistance, party sources said Sunday. But he remained head of the
resistance and was considering changing his mind, the sources said
on condition of anonymity.
   Dissension between moderates pressing for a negotiated settlement
and others opting to continue the guerrilla war against the
Vietnamese-backed government of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
prompted Sihanouk's move, the sources said.
   Sihanouk named his wife, Monique, and Gen. Nhiek Tioulong to
replace him as co-presidents of the movement and designated his son,
Prince Ranariddh as secretary-general.
   The conference has sought an overall peace settlement to end two
decades of violence in Cambodia.
   However, Sihanouk's coalition and Hun Sen remain deadlocked on a
formula for sharing power before general elections.
   Sihanouk has insisted the Khmer Rouge be given a role in a
transitional government to rule after the withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops by late September. Hun Sen says the Khmer Rouge must be
``eliminated'' politically and militarily.
   There was speculation the conference could lead to further
negotiations, even another conference, at a later date, and no one
was prepared to predict failure.
   ``We hope by the end of the year there will possibly be
something,'' said Ek Sereywath, a spokesman for Sihanouk's
delegation. He said he could not predict the outcome of the
conference and was hoping for ``a surprise.''

   A battalion commander has been fired
and his troops ordered to undergo retraining for suffering a defeat
this month at the hands of Communist rebels, the military announced.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano said Saturday he relieved Col. Nestor
Adaza, commander of the 58th Infantry Battalion, after his troops
wandered into a rebel ambush Aug. 20 on Mindanao island.
   Eleven soldiers were killed, 12 were wounded and one was reported
missing after the clash, he said. Troops also lost firearms and
communications equipment to the rebels.
   Battalions in the Philippines normally have more than 300
officers and troopers.
   Also in Manila, press reports said Sunday that President Corazon
Aquino has ordered the destruction of high-powered firearms and
other weapons smuggled into the country.
   The move follows a Cabinet workshop at which officials discussed
the need to show the government's ``strong commitment'' against
crime.
   ``We have to make a bold move to give a signal to the gun
smugglers that the government will not tolerate their illegal
activities,'' the Sunday Times quoted Mrs. Aquino as saying.
   Military officials estimate there are 180,000 unlicensed firearms
nationwide, including those in rebel hands.

   The justice minister resigned because of
death threats from drug traffickers, local reports said Sunday, and
one man was killed in the bombing of 10 banks in the
cocaine-trafficking center of Medellin.
   News reports also said an appeals court has revoked an arrest
order accusing a top drug lord of ordering two assassinations.
   Local news media reports said Sunday that Monica de Greiff was
stepping down as justice minister because of threats against her and
her family since the government launched an unprecendented crackdown
on drug trafficking Aug. 18. Several radio and television stations
carried the reports, which also said Cabinet changes were expected,
without identifying a source.
   A communique issued late Sunday by the presidency said Barco
``denied reports related to the resignation of the justice
minister.'' A spokesman at the presidency said he could not amplify
on the wording of the communique, which appears to but does not
directly deny the reports.
   It also quoted Barco as saying, ``I haven't thought about, nor is
there motive for, a crisis within the Cabinet. It's something I
haven't considered, not for now or for the future.''
   Mrs. de Greiff, 32, has been justice minister for a month and a
half. A predecessor, Rodrigo Lara Bonilla, was assassinated by the
cocaine cartels in 1984.
   According to the private national radio network Radio Caracol,
she told President Virgilio Barco she wanted to resign before
leaving the country Friday for the United States. The network did
not identify the source of its information.
   In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said that
if Mrs. de Greiff applied for political asylum in the United States
she would be welcome.
   ``Of course she would be welcome as other refugees from terrorism
and the kind of violence that affects Colombia have always been,''
he said on the CBS news program ``Face the Nation.''
   Mrs. de Greiff is in the United States, according to an
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity. He
refused to say whether she had resigned. Efforts to reach her Sunday
through U.S. officials and Colombian diplomats in Washington were
unsuccessful.
   The bomb blasts occurred between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. at seven
branches of the national Banco Cafetero, owned by the state and
coffee exporters, a police spokesman in Medellin said in a telephone
interview. He said the bombs did $100,000 in damage but caused no
injuries.
   Later in the day, police said bombs went off at Medellin branches
of the private Banco del Estado and Banco de Colombia, where a young
man was killed. Police said they suspected the victim had placed the
bomnb.
   Police said they were uncertain whether the bombings were carried
out by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas of the National
Liberation Army, which has attacked the bank's offices in the past.
   Last week, the traffickers declared war on the government after
it began a crackdown in response to the assassinations of a
magistrate, a police colonel and a leading presidential candidate
during a 48-hour period ending Aug. 18.
   ``We don't have any group in particular that has taken
responsibility for the explosions,'' the spokesman said. Police may
learn more after interrogating the two suspects, he said.
   Medellin, 215 miles north of Bogota, is the base for the world's
biggest cocaine trafficking cartel that is believed to be
responsible for 80 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United
States.
   The traffickers threatened to target the government, judges,
journalists and industrialists because of the government's offensive.
   The crackdown by the military has confiscated hundreds of
luxurious homes, office buildings and shops believed to belong to
traffickers in addition to aircraft, cars and trucks, yachts and
other goods. Authorities said the raids will continue, but so far
the cartel bosses have eluded security forces.
   Mrs. de Greiff holds a key seat on a special national council
that must decide on the proposed extradition of alleged traffickers
caught up in the new crackdown and wanted by the United States.
   El Tiempo reported Sunday that a court has struck down an arrest
order for Medellin cartel boss Pablo Escobar that accused him of
ordering the massacre of peasants at two ranches by right-wing death
squads.
   Judge Maria Helena Diaz _ who investigated the killings, signed
the arrest order in 1988 and refused to reverse it _ was
assassinated on Aug. 1.
   A three-judge panel upheld her decision in November.
   But El Tiempo said the panel reversed its ruling Aug. 15,
deciding there was insufficient evidence against Escobar, who formed
a trafficking organization in the mid-1970s and has repeatedly
terrorized the judicial system with assassinations and threats,
according to police.
   No such reversal was reported at the time, and it was not
possible to confirm the report with judicial officials Sunday.
   According to the government, the drug cartels are financing the
training of right-wing paramilitary squads that, besides providing
protection for cocaine barons, are blamed for the slayings of
leftist politicians, labor activists, vagabonds, prostitutes and the
old and infirm.

   Witnesses at the military trial of a former
Cuban interior minister indicated he abused power, stole government
money and had illegal weapons, according to a Cuban news report.
   Prosecution and defense lawyers were to present closing arguments
in the Havana trial of Jose Abrantes late Sunday, according to Cuban
news agency Prensa Latina. The dispatch was monitored by Mexico's
Notimex agency.
   In another report monitored in Mexico, Prensa Latina said
evidence presented Saturday in Abrantes' trial proved the division
general abused his position, improperly used financial and material
resources and was negligent in service. He was also found in illegal
possession of arms, the report said.
   Testimony showed he manipulated and withheld information of
interest to the government, the agency said.
   The agency did not say what information Abrantes allegedly
withheld. It gave no details of evidence presented at the trial.
   Three military officers and three civilians testified Saturday,
the third session of the trial, Prensa Latina said.
   Six other officials are standing trial with Abrantes on the same
charges, the agency said. The officials were Pascual Martinez,
former vice minister of the interior, Brig. Gen. Roberto Gonzalez,
Lt. Cols. Oscar Carreno, Manuel Gil and Rolando Castaneda, and
Hector Carbonell, Prensa Latina said.
   Abrantes was fired in June, when 12 military officials from the
Interior Ministry and two from the armed forces were arrested on
drug trafficking and other charges.
   Four of the 14 tried earlier were executed by firing squad and
the others were given prison sentences of up to 30 years.

   Thousands of friends and admirers of Huey
P. Newton lined up for three blocks outside a funeral home Sunday to
pay their respects to the slain Black Panther Party founder.
   ``This is a terrible tragedy for blacks. He stood for black pride
in the '60s and now he stands for the decimation of blacks by
crack,'' LeRoy Johnson, 44, who was among the people, most of them
blacks, who waited quietly to attend the daylong wake.
   Jimmy Smith, operator of the Palmer D. Whitted funeral home in a
rundown section of east Oakland, estimated that 6,000 people filed
past Newton's open casket.
   Newton, 47, was shot to death Tuesday in what police said was a
dispute over crack cocaine in the drug-ridden west Oakland
neighborhood where he began organizing blacks more than 20 years
ago. He went on to found the Panthers with Bobby Seale.
   Thousands, including fellow radicals from the 1960s and '70s,
were expected to attend Newton's funeral Monday at the Allen Temple
Baptist Church. The body was moved there later Sunday.
   ``He made us have black pride,'' said longtime friend Norma
Corman, 38. ``He was a good man destroyed by the badness of drugs.''
   However, many in line at the funeral home said they didn't
believe the police account of Newton's death and blamed it on
authorities.
   ``The police were always after Huey,'' said Jeffrey deLeong, 28.
``The Man got him.''
   Members of the Revolutionary Communist Party handed out leaflets
saying ``the word in the streets'' was that Newton's death was
caused by police.
   Most were dressed in black and many wore three-piece suits or
elegant Sunday dresses. One man held a Black Panther Party flag,
with its red, black and green tricolors and a red star in the
center. A few wore T-shirts supporting the African separatist
movement for black Americans.
   A television cameraman taping interviews with mourners was
attacked and injured by a group of men who had warned him earlier
that they didn't want their pictures taken, police and KTVU-Channel
2 officials said.
   Cameraman Henry Faybusovic, his camera on his shoulder, later
turned toward the men, and they came at him, apparently thinking he
was taping them, said KTVU-Channel 2 Assignment Editor Eric Amorde.
   The men, who had not been in line, kicked and punched Faybusovic
repeatedly, Amorde said.
   Faybusovic suffered cuts and scrapes and was being X-rayed for
internal injuries at hospital, said police Sgt. C. Vierra.
   A self-proclaimed prison gang member who police say admitted
killing Newton remained held without bail awaiting arraignment
Monday on a homicide charge.
   Investigators said Tyrone Robinson, 25, told them he shot Newton
in self-defense after Newton, who battled drug and alcohol
addictions, pulled a gun on him and demanded crack.
   Police said they don't believe the ex-convict's account and
instead think the slaying was an attempt by Robinson to rise in the
Black Guerrilla Family, a drug-running, prison-based gang that
Newton allegedly opposed.
   Newton's family has declined to comment since the police
announcement Friday of Robinson's arrest 14 hours after the slaying.
   The Black Guerrilla Family was founded in the prisons in the
1960s by inmate George Jackson, also a member of the Black Panthers,
who died in an escape attempt at San Quentin prison in 1971.
   In the final hours of his life, Newton went to a ``crack house,''
where he caused a commotion in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain the
drug, according to police.
   After being told to leave the house, Newton ran into Robinson a
short distance away, police said. Newton was shot three times in the
head.
   Robinson, who was on parole for a robbery conviction, was
arrested Tuesday for investigations of weapons violations about a
block from where the shooting occurred. He admitted to the killing
on Friday, police said.

   Spanish police arrested more than 400 people
and seized drugs, guns and jewelry in a 48-hour crackdown on
small-time drug pushers and criminals that ended early Sunday.
   More than 4,000 policemen took part in the operation that covered
Catalonia in the northeast to Andalusia in the south, including the
Balearic and Canary Islands.
   Police seized more than 2 pounds of heroin, 22 pounds of cocaine
and 1,430 pounds of hashish. They also confiscated 25 guns, 75
knives and $132,200.
   Stolen property seized included 100 pieces of jewelry, 50
cameras, 50 radio-cassette players, 30 video cassette recorders and
televisions, and 40 stolen cars, police said.
   On April 23, police seized 1,230 pounds of cocaine on a beach
near Barcelona, and arrested four people. Police said the seizure
was the largest ever in Europe.
   Spain has become a major point of entry to Europe for cocaine
from Latin America and heroin from the Middle East and Southeast
Asia, drug enforcement agents have said.

   It covers a space roughly the size of a
football field and boasts 10 bedrooms and 10 full bathrooms. But
locals say Dunnellen Hall also carries a curse that has brought ruin
to its previous owners and could be a bad omen for the home's
current mistress, Leona Helmsley.
   The opulent, 28-room Jacobean mansion on the outskirts of
Greenwich has been in the national limelight in recent weeks because
of the federal tax evasion case against Mrs. Helmsley.
   She and her billionaire husband, Harry Helmsley, were accused of
billing $3 million in expenses at the house to their real estate
empire and hotel chain. A federal jury in New York began
deliberating the fate of Mrs. Helmsley and two former aides this
weekend. Harry Helmsley was severed from the indictment because of
mental incompetence.
   The prosecutor, assistant U.S. attorney James DeVita, says the
money was spent in a bid to turn the home into a modern Taj Mahal.
   ``It's probably one of the most important houses in Greenwich,''
says Majorie Rowe, president and co-owner of Preferred Properties in
Greenwich.
   ``This house has some history, if the walls could talk,'' said
Rowe, who has twice handled its sale.
   Two previous owners lost the estate to financial setbacks,
another was indicted for forgery and a Dodge automotive heiress
suffered marital problems with a husband who killed a busboy in
Florida and later killed himself.
   The three-story brick mansion sits on 26 acres of rolling hills
in the northern end of this posh New York suburb. Stone walls, iron
fences and a sophisticated electronic system keep the curious at
bay. But a glimpse is possible through the main gate and up a
1,000-foot driveway painted brick red for Leona's birthday in 1986.
   The curious can also get a feel for the house by watching for a
late night rerun of the 1968 film ``A Lovely Way To Die.'' The
movie, starring Kirk Douglas, was filmed at the estate, and in
keeping with the alleged curse at Dunnellen, it was a flop.
   The Helmsley's hometown newspaper, the Greenwich Time, recently
obtained a rare look inside the house.
   Its reporter described in detail the ornate dining room, with its
chandelier, tapestry, paintings and floor-to-ceiling wainscotting;
the limestone-walled reception hall; the grand staircase; the
second-floor workout room where Harry Helmsley exercises on a
treadmill under the eye of his personal instructor; and the pictures
of a smiling Leona and Harry Helmsley that grace nearly every room
on the first and second floors.
   The main house stretches about 300 feet from end to end and is
more than 200 feet wide. It has more than 28,000 square feet of
living space, and includes 10 bedrooms and 10 full baths.
   Separate from the mansion is a 100-foot-by-25-foot guard house
that provides nearly an additional 4,000 square feet of living
space. The building provides five more bedrooms and three more
bathrooms, according to records at the Greenwich assessor's office.
   By comparison, the White House has 55,000 square feet of living
space spread over six floors. The White House also has 132 rooms,
much smaller than those in the Helmsleys' mansion.
   Dunnellen Hall was built in 1916 by Daniel Grey Reid for his only
daughter. It had four more owners, each of whom suffered some ill
fortune, before it was purchased by the Helmsleys in 1983 for $11
million.
   Shortly after purchasing the home, the Helmsleys constructed a
4,453-square foot addition that runs more than 88 feet to enclose
the swimming pool. Constructed of limestone and marble, and topped
by a marble dance floor, the addition cost about $2 million. It also
is one expense the Helmsley's allegedly billed to their business.
   Rowe said the house also features a ``dramatic'' stairway in the
main entry, a ``handsome'' library and many other ``gorgeous'' rooms.
   Other renovations made by the Helmsleys include a $130,000,
remote-control outdoor-indoor stereo system, which is named in the
47-count federal indictment.
   There's also a wine cellar that can hold up to 5,000 bottles and
maintain them at 54 degrees, according to literature on the house.
   The kitchen features a huge walk-in bank vault that is 8 feet
wide, 8 feet long and 10 feet high. Inside the vault are silver
trays, goblets, candelabra ahd champagne buckets.
   The mansion is maintained by a full-time staff of 15, including
chambermaids, three gardeners, a chef, a butler and a 24-hour
security crew, the Greenwich Time reported.
   The previous owners who suffered the ``curse'' of Dunnellen Hall
are:
   _Loring Washburn, president of a steel fabricating company who
bought the house in 1950, but lost it to a commercial financing firm
in 1963.
   _Sherwood Dodge Moran, of the Dodge automobile family, bought the
house in 1967. A year later, her husband, a former New York City
policeman, shot and killed a busboy who was apparently trying to
climb into the bedroom window of their Florida home. The slaying was
ruled justifiable homicide.
   She sold the home in 1968; 10 years later her husband died of a
self-inflicted gunshot.
   _Investor Jack Dick bought the home in 1968. He was indicted on
larceny and foregery charges in 1971, but died in 1974 before his
case was settled.
   _Ravi Tikkoo, who owned the world's largest oil tanker, was the
next owner. He lost his fortune during the Arab oil embargo.

   Israel on Sunday deported a prominent Arab
activist and four other Palestinians it accused of leading the
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The deportations raised to 60 the number of Palestinians expelled
from the occupied territories during the 20-month uprising against
Israeli rule.
   Four Palestinians were deported to Lebanon. A fifth, physicist
Taysir Aruri, whose cause has been championed by international human
rights groups, was expelled to France after he appealed to Israel's
Supreme Court, saying he could face death in Lebanon.
   The deportations came as Israel bombed a pro-Iranian Shiite
stronghold in southeast Lebanon, killing one guerrilla and wounding
five others, police reported. It was the ninth Israeli air raid into
Lebanon this year.
   Aruri's wife brought their three young children to Ben Gurion
Airport to see their father off. But she was removed by police after
she became the center of a scuffle involving pro-Palestinian
demonstrators and angry Israelis.
   Aruri did not speak to reporters when he arrived in Paris. There
has been speculation he was headed for Tunis, headquarters of the
Palestine Liberation Organization. But late Sunday, PLO sources said
he could be planning to go to the United States.
   Aruri has held meetings with Israeli peace activists. He
advocates peaceful creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel.
   Army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron said on army radio
Sunday that Israel would continue to deport Palestinians despite
complaints by foreign governments and human rights groups that the
action violates international law.
   Shomron said Israel considers deportation an effective deterrent
against the uprising.
   The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement saying Aruri was
welcome indefinitely in France, and referred to his expulsion as ``a
measure contrary to the Geneva Convention protecting civilians in
time of war.''
   The United States also has condemned such expulsions as a
violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention.
   None of the five Palestinians expelled Sunday faced trial or
formal charges. Appeals by four of the men were rejected by the
Supreme Court Thursday, and the fifth was turned down a month
earlier. The court never has overturned an army deportation order.
   Aruri, 43, a physics professor at the West Bank's Bir Zeit
University named a ``prisoner of conscience'' by Amnesty
International, was accused of being a member of the outlawed
Palestinian Communist Party.
   The army also said he was ``involved in planning the uprising and
a member of the uprising's unified command.'' The announcement of
the four other deportations said the men ``participated in leading
and directing the uprising'' in the West Bank.
   One deportee, Mohammed Matur, was accused by the army of being a
leader of PLO chief Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction. The
others were said to be members of the Marxist Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, a leftist PLO group.
   On arrival in south Lebanon, Lebanese police reported the four
asked to be taken to bases of the Democratic Front in western Bekaa
valley.
   Sunday's air raid into Lebanon was believed to be in retaliation
for the Aug. 9 suicide car bomb attack carried out by the
Iranian-supported Hezbollah. Five Israeli soldiers and an allied
Lebanese militiaman were injured in the car bombing, and Israeli
officials have vowed to avenge the attack.
   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, has said it carried out the
bombing to avenge Israel's kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric,
Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid. Israeli commandos seized Obeid in a
southern Lebanese village on July 28.

   Author Irving Stone, the pioneer of the
biographical novel who wrote the popular epics ``Lust for Life,''
``The Agony and the Ecstasy'' and ``Love is Eternal,'' has died at
age 86.
   Stone died of heart failure Saturday at 11:20 p.m. at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, hospital spokesman Paula Correia said
Sunday. He was admitted to Cedars-Sinai on July 24 after complaining
of difficulty in swallowing.
   Stone produced a stream of best-selling biographical novels that
his publishing company estimates have totaled more than 30 million
copies.
   His fictionalized portraits include Michelangelo in ``The Agony
and the Ecstasy,'' Vincent Van Gogh in ``Lust for Life,'' Jack
London in ``Sailor on Horseback,'' Abraham and Mary Lincoln in
``Love is Eternal,'' Sigmund Freud in ``The Passions of the Mind,''
Charles Darwin in ``The Origin,'' Andrew and Rachel Jackson in ``The
President's Lady,'' and Eugene Debs in ``Adversary in the House.''
   Five books were made into movies. ``The Agony and the Ecstasy,''
released in 1965, starred Charlton Heston in the title role. ``Lust
for Life,'' released in 1956, featured Kirk Douglas as Van Gogh and
Anthony Quinn as Paul Gauguin.
   ``Irving Stone's gift was remarkable,'' Heston said Sunday. ``He
had a prodigious talent. We'll miss him, but I'm glad we still have
his books.''
   Stone also produced ``Clarence Darrow for the Defense,'' a
biography of the famed lawyer.
   In a 1985 interview with The Associated Press, Stone explained
his fascination with biography:
   ``In the biographical novel there's only one person involved. I,
the author, spend two to five years becoming the main character. I
do that so by the time you get to the bottom of page two or three,
you forget your name, where you live, your profession and the year
it is. You become the main character of the book. You live the
book.''
   His wife, Jean, said her husband was working on a biographical
novel up to his death and she hoped it would somehow be completed in
the future. She did not disclose the subject of the book.
   ``The only thing he ever wanted to do was write books and that's
what he did all his live and we did it together,'' Mrs. Stone said
in a telephone interview from the couple's Beverly Hills home.
   ``That will be his immortality _ the books he left,'' she added.
   ``Whether you call his books biographical novels or novelistic
biographies, Irving Stone set out to do something completely
distinctive and he succeeded,'' said Jack Miles, book editor of the
Los Angeles Times. ``He was a teacher as well as a writer.''
   ``He brought history to millions of people who otherwise might be
not be interested in it,'' said Herbert Mitgang, cultural
correspondent for The New York Times.
   Born in San Francisco on July 14, 1903, Stone attended the
University of California at Berkeley and taught economics there. He
seemed destined for a teaching career until he went to Paris in 1926.
   There he made his first acquaintance with the impressionist
artists. Out of it came ``Lust for Life,'' which was published in
1934.
   ```Lust for Life' was turned down by 17 leading publishers in New
York and Boston,'' Stone recalled in a 1984 interview.
   ``Always with the same comment: How can you sell a book about an
unknown Dutch painter to the American public in the middle of a
depression?
   ``At the time I was engaged to Jean (Factor) but I had no money
to get married,'' he continued. ``She said, `Let me read the book.'
She suggested making cuts here and there and prepared a new
typescript. Longmans Green, which had published only one novel
before, accepted it.''
   ``Lust for Life'' allowed Stone and Ms. Factor to marry, and she
has been his editor ever since. For 55 years they had been
associated with Doubleday &amp; Co., one of the houses that initially
rejected ``Lust for Life.''
   Stone once said he never got lonely as a writer, and added: ``I
have always believed that the book is the most important tool that
man has ever invented, more important that the wheel, cement or
running water.
   ``As long as I can remember, I never wanted to do anything but
write. I started with a short story at 9. I never stopped, even when
I was rejected by the literary magazine at Berkeley. My manuscript
came back with the note, `Why don't you learn how to write?','' he
said.
   He meticulously researched each novel spending numerous months
delving into archives, scouring libraries, digging in basemants, and
living in garrets, studios and even asylums.
   ``To write the inner truth of these people, I have to get inside
them. I have to go through absolutely everything they did,'' he
said. ``By the end of the first page, the reader should have
forgotten his name, his job, where he lives. He should have become
Michelangelo, Van Gogh.''
   Stone is survived by his wife, their son Kenneth and daughter
Paula.
   A memorial service for friends and relatives will be held at Leo
Baeck Temple in Los Angeles later this week, his wife said. There
will be no funeral.

   Delegates to the first assembly of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on Sunday delayed a decision
on whether to set a deadline for selling off stock in companies
doing business in South Africa.
   After some debate, the decision was deferred until later in the
eight-day meeting of about 1,040 representatives, which runs through
Wednesday.
   At issue was how rapidly the church's Board of Pensions should
divest from such companies to push South Africa to end its system of
racial separation and domination of 28 million blacks by 5 million
whites.
   After morning worship services in Chicago-area churches around
this suburb, the delegates spent more than three hours discussing
other aspects of the pension program, including medical benefits,
and the South African issue.
   ``There is no way one can prudently divest the portfolio except
gradually over a long period of time. It must be handled with care
and fiduciary responsibility,'' said board President John Kapanke of
Minneapolis.
   But the Pension Members for Justice, a group on the other side of
the issue, said the church has an ethical responsibility to divest
quickly.
   ``If we can't be ready to hear the voices of blacks crying for
justice above the call of profit yield, then it doesn't mean
anything to belong to the body of Christ,'' said the Rev. Joseph W.
Ellwanger of Milwaukee.
   The assembly is the first for the 5.3 million-member denomination
since the merger Jan. 1, 1988, of the Lutheran Church in America,
the American Lutheran Church and the Association of Evangelical
Lutheran Churches.
   Late Saturday, the assembly called for an end to U.S. military
aid to Central America and of ``all destabilizing military
involvement'' by outside nations.
   The Rev. Mary Ann Moller-Gunderson of Madison, Wis., said
violence has increased in El Salvador.
   The resolution backed peace efforts by the Central American
governments themselves, and urged relief and development aid for the
region and lifting of the U.S. economic embargo against Nicaragua.
   The denomination's pension board holds $1.6 billion in
investments for about 26,000 participants, mostly clergy, 5,700 of
them already retired and on pensions.
   Kapanke said that since early 1988, the board had reduced
investments in companies operating in South Africa from $152 million
to $84.9 million.
   ``We think we are one of the leading denominations in
divestment,'' he said. ``But we are required by law to manage the
fund solely in the interest of members with care, skill, prudence
and dilegence.''
   That demands financial caution, he said in an interview. He said
divestment carried out without fiduciary considerations ``could mean
a loss.''
   However, the justice group argues that for the church, ``the
notion of `prudent investment' takes on a deeper theological meaning
of faithfulness ...''
   ``The board's fiduciary responsibility requires it to take into
account not only economic factors, but also the gospel of Jesus
Christ ... and the church's overwhelming opposition to investment in
South Africa,'' the group has said.
   ``A church should be willing to sacrifice and take risks to end
apartheid,'' said Bishop David W. Olson of Minneapolis.
   ``It is possible it could mean a financial sacrifice. Even if it
costs, it should be done for moral reasons,'' he said.
   Several denominations _ including the United Church of Christ,
the Episcopal Church, the Church of the Brethren and the Quakers _
have decided to sell all stock in companies operating in South
Africa, but are not yet totally divested.
   The justice group pointed out that the Episcopal Church and the
United Church of Chris have have active ``no-buy'' policies for such
stock and have made more progress in divesting than the Lutheran
denomination.
   Its pension board has had a ``passive and partial divestment''
policy, the group says, and actually has increased indirect
investments in companies in South Africa.
   Forty-four of the denomination's 65 regional synods have urged
the board to divest totally from firms doing business in South
Africa. Some synods set a Jan. 1, 1991, deadline for this to be
accomplished.

<HEAD>Holocaust Survivors Urge Pope to Remove Nuns from Auschwitz</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOCH SHELDRAKE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 Jewish Holocaust
survivors Sunday called on Pope John Paul II to remove a
controversial Carmelite convent from a building at the site of the
Auschwitz concentration camp.
   A statement released by the American Gathering-Federation of
Jewish Holocaust Survivors, meeting at Brown's Hotel in Sullivan
County, said Vatican silence on the issue was reminiscent of papal
inaction during World War II, when more than six million Jews died
in the Holocaust.
   Benjamin Meed, president of the American Gathering, said the
presence of the Carmelite nuns at the site angered Jews and that
they had ``set up symbols of faith holy to them but alien to most of
those who perished at Auschwitz.''
   The nuns have been the subject of protests by Jewish groups for
about two years. Catholic leaders signed an accord with Jewish
leaders agreeing to remove the group by Feb. 22, 1989, but the nuns
are still in the building in Oswiecim, Poland, a few feet from the
fence surrounding the concentration camp.
   The statement to the Pope read in part, ``You lived in the
vicinity of Auschwitz during the years of the Holocaust. You know of
the murders at Auschwitz. ... Surely you know that the overwhelming
majority of the victims were Jews, killed solely because they were
sons and daughters of the Jewish people. Their memory must be
honored, their identity affirmed.
   ``Neither a convent nor a synagogue should be on the grounds of
Auschwitz. The holy martyrs of Auschwitz should be left
undisturbed,'' the statement said.

   A 22-year-old airline mechanic lost her lower
right leg after she was run over by a taxiing jet at O'Hare
International Airport, her surgeon said Sunday.
   Hope Lewellen, 22, of Orland Park was in critical but stable
condition at Lutheran General Hospital in suburban Park Ridge after
nine hours of surgery to repair injuries to both legs suffered
Saturday, said Dr. Wayne Goldstein.
   Ms. Lewellen, a Continental Airlines employee, had been directing
a Scandinavian Airlines 767 jet to a gate for departure to
Stockholm, Sweden, when she was run over.
   Ms. Lewellen leaned down to pick up earphones that had fallen off
her head, and the pilot did not know she was still behind the
aircraft, which was backing up, said Patrolman Dan Cirighini of the
police department's O'Hare unit.
   Continental employees were the only people aboard the plane at
the time, said airline spokeswoman Marj Abrams. Continental is under
contract with Scandinavian Airlines to service Scandinavian's jets
in the United States.

black teen-ager was slain angrily taunted about 100 people who
marched through the streets Sunday to protest the death.
   The protesters, led by clergy members, gathered in the
Bensonhurst neighborhood where 16-year-old Yusef Hawkins was shot
dead Wednesday as he was confronted by a gang of bat-wielding whites.
   The group of about 30 blacks and 70 whites was escorted by 20
police on motorcycles and dozens more on foot as about 300 white
residents lined the street.
   Many residents watched passively from windows and storefronts
while others walked along the street waving posters in the air and
chanting, ``Go home. Go home.''
   Some residents shouted, ``Free the boys from Bensonhurst,'' a
reference to five white youths who have been arrested in the
slaying. Others booed the marchers and chanted ``Central Park,
Central Park,'' referring to the recent rape and beating of a white
jogger there, allegedly by a gang of blacks and Hispanics. Some made
obscene gestures.
   One man was taken into custody but not immediately charged after
a small firecracker was thrown at the demonstrators, said Sgt. Ed
Burns, a police spokesman.
   The protesters, led by the Rev. Timothy Mitchell, chanted,
``Whose city? Our city,'' as they walked about 10 blocks from the
site of the killing through the community's streets.
   ``New York City is not going to become Johannesburg, South
Africa. This is our city and we are going to walk wherever we want.
We need to see more of the good people in this community,'' Mitchell
said at the site of Hawkins' death.
   Throughout the march, police blocked streets with barricades to
prevent confrontations.
   Hawkins and three friends were attacked by a gang of neighborhood
whites carrying baseball bats, two-by-fours and golf clubs when they
arrived in Brooklyn's mostly Italian-Jewish Bensonhurst section to
answer an advertisement for a used car.
   Police said the gang was angered by a local white girl's dating
of a black youth, and they gathered with the intention of attacking
the black when he arrived for the girl's birthday party.
   A protest march Saturday afternoon by blacks through the mostly
white neighborhood was greeted with jeers, spitting and racial
slurs. Some whites held up watermelons as 300 or so blacks marched
through.
   Residents also chanted ``Central Park, Central Park'' during that
incident. The blacks answered with ``Howard Beach, Howard Beach,'' a
reference to the December 1986 killing of Michael Griffith, 23.
   ``This is about what we expected,'' said Joseph Calzerano, the
police department's chief of operations. ``The feelings are running
high.''
   ``If we didn't do it because of what happened yesterday then it
would be just like South Africa,'' Mitchell said before a brief
memorial service at the site of the killing Sunday.
   Five suspects in the attack were arraigned Saturday. Four were
released Sunday on $75,000 bail; the fifth, Keith Mondello, 18, whom
authorities called the instigator, was released on $100,000 bail.
   The other suspects are Steven Curreri, 18; Pasquale Raucci, 19;
Charles Stressler, 21; and James Patino, 24.
   Meanwhile, police continued looking for 18-year-old Joseph Fama,
who was wanted for questioning. News reports have said investigators
believe he was the gunman.
   Mondello, Curreri, Raucci and Stressler are charged with assault,
aggravated harassment, violation of civil rights, menacing and
possession of deadly weapons, the baseball bats. Patino was charged
with assault, riot, aggravated harassment and violation of civil
rights.

   Tropical Storm Felix moved slowly across the eastern
Atlantic on Sunday with top winds of 50 mph, but posed no threat to
land, forecasters said.
   Felix, the sixth named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane
season, formed Saturday in the Cape Verde Islands off western Africa
even as Tropical Storm Erin faded far to the north without touching
land.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Sunday, the center of Felix was near latitude
19.2 north, longitude 24.7 west, or about 200 miles northwest the
Cape Verde island of Sal, said forecasters at the National Hurricane
Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   It was moving north northwest near 7 mph and was expected to
maintain that course through the day. Maximum sustained winds were
at 50 mph, with higher gusts in squalls. The storm was expected to
continue this motion Monday, said hurricane specialist Hal Gerrish.
   Erin, the third hurricane of the season, also was spawned off the
tip of western Africa. It became a tropical storm Aug. 19 and
reached hurricane strength on Tuesday, but was downgraded Saturday
as it moved over cold waters 800 miles west of Ireland.
   A tropical depression becomes a named storm when sustained winds
reach 39 mph and a hurricane if winds climb to 74 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<HEAD>UAW Employees at Chrysler-Mitsubishi Venture Ratifiy New Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORMAL, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Auto Workers members at Diamond-Star
Motors, a Chrysler-Mitsubishi joint venture, ratified a three-year
contract Sunday that provides wage-and-benefit increases of more
than 30 percent.
   The new contract, approved by 1,644 of about 2,300 production and
maintenance workers at the auto assembly plant, was worked out
during five months of negotiations.
   The vote was 1,258 in favor to 383 against, said UAW spokesman
Dennis Miller.
   The $650 million plant, which began making cars about a year ago,
employs about 2,900 people. The company produces a two-door sporty
sedan marketed as the Plymouth Laser and the Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   ``We are gratified that the members recognized significant
advances in the first contract and are confident that it builds a
firm foundation for future progress,'' said Bill Stewart, director
of the Chicago-based UAW chapter.
   Under the agreement, production workers who have been on the job
18 months will have a base wage of $12.79 an hour, which will
increase to $17.01 an hour at the end of the three-year contract.
   Maintenance workers, including skilled positions such as
electricians and welders, would begin at $14.89 an hour and increase
to $19.49 at the end of three years.
   The increases include periodic wage increases and cost-of-living
adjustments.
   The raises are intended to bring Diamond-Star workers into line
with the wages of other UAW-represented auto plants, and
specifically with Chrysler plants.
   The contract also includes a ``me too'' provision that passes on
to Diamond-Star workers any Chrysler increases that occur during the
life of the pact.
   Also included is a $750 settlement bonus for ratification of the
contract, and two lump sum payments equal to 3 percent of earnings.
   Job security provisions are ``among the strongest in the
industry,'' according to a letter to members of UAW Local 2488 from
Bill Stewart, regional director.
   According to the contract, the company agrees not to lay off
workers ``unless compelled to do so by severe economic conditions
that threaten the long-term life of the company.''
   If layoffs are necessary, the contract provides that workers
would receive 80 percent of their pay for up to a year. Stewart
termed that part of the contract proposal ``prededent-setting.''
   The agreement also includes added health benefits, retirement at
age 55 after five years of service and other improvements.

<HEAD>Juveniles Charged With Shooting At Interstate Motorists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEMPLE HILLS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four children ranging in age from 9 to
14 were apprehended for allegedly firing .22 caliber rifles at
passing motorists on Interstate 95, wounding one person, police said
Sunday.
   The youngsters were captured about 8:30 p.m. Saturday after a
citizen reported gunfire coming from a wooded area near the highway
and police sent up a helicopter to investigate, state police
spokesman Chuck Jackson said.
   The shootings apparently began Aug. 18, when a 49-year-old
Calvert County man was wounded in the shoulder while driving north
on I-95, Jackson said.
   A 14-year-old La Plata youth and an 11-year-old from Temple Hills
were charged with assault with intent to maim. The 14-year-old also
was charged with two counts of assault with intent to murder and one
count of destruction of property, Jackson said.
   Police believe the 14-year-old fired his weapon in the direction
of the state police as they scoured the woods and as the helicopter
circled above, Jackson said.
   The 9-year-old and his 12-year-old brother, both of Temple Hills,
were released into the custody of their parents without being
charged.
   On Aug. 18, James Orchard of Lusby, Md., was injured when a
bullet pierced his windshield and hit his shoulder.
   State police also confirmed at least three other incidents of
gunfire, which resulted in damage to three vehicles on I-95, Jackson
said.
   The 14-year-old was placed in the custody of the Maryland
Department of Juvenile Services. The 11-year-old was released to his
parents' custody.
   Two .22 caliber rifles were recovered in the area where the
youngsters were taken into custody, Jackson said.

   More than 30 inmates were injured Sunday
night when a fight broke out at an upstate medium-security prison,
authorities said.
   About 200 inmates were in the prison yard near the outdoor
weight-lifting equipment when the fight erupted at about 7:45 p.m.
at the Cayuga Correctional Facility, according to state corrections
spokesman James Flateau.
   Flateau said prison guards broke up the fight and returned the
inmates to their dormitories by 8:35 p.m.
   Six inmates were taken to hospitals and 12 others were being
treated for injuries at the prison infirmary, Flateau said. Most of
the injuries involved cuts and bruises and none was serious, he
said. No guards were hurt.
   Fourteen other inmates were later sent to the prison infirmary
after being checked by guards, Flateau said.
   Flateau said Cayuga, which opened in 1988, currently holds 972
inmates, which is near its capacity. Among them are 175 being housed
in the prison gymnasium as part of a state plan to ease overcrowding
in local jails.
   ``At this point we don't know which inmates were involved'' in
the fight or what caused it, Flateau said.
   Cayuga is in central New York about 45 miles southwest of
Syracuse.

<HEAD>FAA: Strike Has Not Affected Eastern Safety</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration has
determined that the strike by Eastern Airlines pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists union members has not affected safety.
   ``Eastern's post-strike maintenance compares favorably with that
of air carriers having equivalent aircraft, fleet size, utilization
rates and operating environments,'' the FAA said in a report,
according to The New York Times.
   David I. Shapiro, a court-appointed examiner reviewing Eastern's
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing protection, requested the FAA report,
the Times reported in Saturday's editions.
   The FAA also gave a passing grade to the replacement pilots
Eastern hired and praised the airline's improved training
procedures, the Times reported.
   ``We've really been raked over the coals by the unions. ... It's
gratifying that the FAA says it's satisfied,'' said Edward F. Upton,
Eastern vice president for maintenance and engineering. Eastern is
owned by Texas Air Corp., which is headed by Frank Lorenzo.
   Officials at the unions, which went on strike March 4, dismissed
the FAA report and questioned the integrity of the investigators.
   The FAA investigators ``see no evil, hear no evil and speak no
evil of Lorenzo and the Texas Air management,'' said Donald L.
Miller, shop committee chairman in Miami for the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.

<HEAD>Report Says FBI Investigates Futures Brokerage Executive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal authorities are investigating whether an
influential brokerage executive invested millions of dollars in a
possibly illegal tax shelter, according to a published report.
   The FBI is trying to determine whether Thomas Dittmer, chairman
of Refco Group Ltd., one of the nation's largest futures brokerages,
improperly shielded from the Internal Revenue Service up to $10
million in income in 1982 and 1983, the Chicago Tribune reported in
its Sunday editions.
   Federal agents believe Dittmer is one of many commodities-related
businessmen who made money-losing investments overseas that enabled
them to avoid paying U.S. taxes on some of their earnings _
including profits from their own trades at commodity exchanges in
Chicago and other cities, the newspaper said, citing unidentified
sources.
   The sources said Dittmer and others may have subtracted the
overseas losses from their earnings to lower the portion of their
total incomes subject to federal taxes.
   The actions would be legal if overseas losses stemmed from
legitimate investments, but investigators suspect some of the
transactions involved phony paperwork to describe investments that
never occurred, the Tribune said.
   Dittmer, a Lake Forest resident whose name often appears on lists
of America's wealthiest individuals, has an unlisted telephone
number and could not be reached by The Associated Press for comment.
He denied repeated requests for an interview, the Tribune said.
   Sources say Dittmer's attorney claims the executive did not
knowingly violate any law and believed the transactions were
legitimate, the newspaper reported.
   The inquiry into the alleged use of tax shelters does not appear
to be connected to a 2{-year federal probe of the Chicago Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which has resulted in the
indictments of 46 traders.
   Terree Bowers, an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles who is
supervising one aspect of the tax shelter probe, said futures
traders and other businessmen may have used losses from overseas
investments to shave up to $500 million from their taxable incomes
in the early 1980s.
   Investigators also are focusing on several Chicago businessmen
they suspect acted as intermediaries in arranging the overseas
investments for Dittmer and other brokers and traders, the Tribune
said.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Antilock brakes will be standard equipment on all
General Motors Corp. cars and light trucks by 1994, according to a
report to be published Monday by an automotive trade journal.
   Over the next three years, GM also plans to offer antilock brakes
as optional equipment on smaller cars, reports the weekly Automotive
Electronic News.
   Some larger GM cars already carry antilock brakes as standard
equipment, while others offer them as extra-cost options.
   GM spokesman Dave Sloan would not confirm the 1994 date, which
the trade journal attributed to unidentified sources.
   ``We have said in public before that we do plan to have antilock
brakes on most of our cars by the mid-1990s,'' Sloan said.
   Antilock brakes help prevent skidding on slippery roads or during
panic stops by varying braking pressure many times a second.

<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp.'s hourly workers at its St. Louis
II assembly plant have voted 1,133-598 to open talks on a new
staffing system that would allow the company to boost output of its
popular stretch minivans.
   Voting concluded Friday, said Billy Joe Jenkins of the United
Auto Workers union Local 110 at the plant.
   Under the proposed staffing system, three crews would be assigned
to staggered shifts of four 10-hour days each. Jenkins said tough
negotiations are ahead, especially if the company resists paying
overtime for Saturday work.
   If approved, the plan would add 1,200 workers to the plant's
3,300 employees and boost vehicle output by about 18 percent without
increasing assembly line speed, Chrysler said.

<HEAD>Government Announces New Screening, Closures of Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chinese authorities announced Sunday a new wave of
closures of commercial, financial and supply companies as part of
their efforts to restore central economic controls that were relaxed
in recent years.
   An order issued by the Communist Party Central Committee and the
State Council, China's cabinet, said elimination of companies that
are ``redundant, not qualified, not able to meet the public needs,
in violation of state laws or disciplines, poorly managed or
insolvent'' will last until March.
   The official Xinhua News Agency announced the decision Sunday but
said it was made Aug. 17, the first indication that the ruling
party's powerful Central Committee met then. There was no
explanation for the delay in announcing the decision.
   Xinhua gave no estimate of the number of companies that would be
closed. It said others would lose preferential treatment, such as
tax reduction or exemption _ favors given by some locales to
encourage new private or semi-private business.
   The government already has said it will cut sharply the number of
companies authorized to conduct foreign trade on the grounds that
the proliferation of trade companies in the past few years has
caused market confusion.
   Last month, the party Politburo and State Council shut down two
large, state-owned conglomerates, including one linked to senior
leader Deng Xiaoping's son, Deng Pufang, and ordered audits of
others. In those cases, however, the main reason given was alleged
corruption.
   The two bodies also barred children and spouses of top government
and party leaders from working in commercial companies because of
frequent conflicts of interest. The government said Saturday that
all those affected by the order had quit their jobs.
   The new order was much broader and appeared directed at the
millions of factories and commercial companies that have sprung up
outside the state plan during a decade of economic reform.
   Central authorities have been trying since last fall to regain
control over these companies, of which some fall under provincial or
city governments and others are privately or collectively owned.
   These operations have far outstripped the large,
central-government controlled sector in efficiency and profits, and
have siphoned away scarce raw materials and funds.
   Many local governments so far have defied Beijing's orders to
``rectify'' their economies, and it was not clear how the government
intended to enforce the new order. Xinhua said provincial governors
would share responsiblity for its implementation.

   Regulators have closed four small savings and
loans in Arkansas and California, bringing to 11 the number of
thrifts closed since President Bush signed the S&amp;L bailout bill on
Aug. 9.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency created to dispose of
thrifts and their assets, said Friday it was paying off the deposit
customers of Home Federal Savings and Loan Association of Mountain
Home, Ark., which had about $72 million in deposits.
   The agency will try to sell Home Federal's $46 million in loans
and other assets to recoup some of its expenses.
   The RTC also will pay off depositors in First Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Association in Malvern, Ark., which the agency had been unable
to sell. The institution had assets of $45.2 million and deposits of
$52.7 million. The assets will be liquidated, the RTC said.
   The RTC said the Office of Thrift Supervision closed Perpetual
Savings and Loan Association of Santa Ana, Calif., and named RTC
receiver.
   RTC approved the transfer of deposits to Bank of Industry,
located in City of Industry, Calif., for the payment of $15,000.
Bank of Industry also will have an option to acquire assets of
Perpetual.
   Perpetual had assets of $30.4 million and deposits of $29 million.
   Also, City Savings &amp; Loan Association of Westlake Village,
Calif., was closed, and its deposits were transfered to Olympic
National Bank of Los Angeles. Olympic paid $252,000 for them and
will have an option to acquire the thrift's assets.
   City had assets of $33.4 million and deposits of $33.5 million.
   The RTC, which is run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., has
more than 260 other insolvent thrifts in its control, awaiting final
disposal.
