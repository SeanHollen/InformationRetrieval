<HEAD>Mystery Pilot Sued Anew; Bounced Check Revealed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A communications firm filed suit Thursday
against Thomas Root, the lawyer pulled from the Atlantic Ocean last
month after a mystery-filled plane ride, for allegedly failing to
return $75,000 to a broadcast client.
   In a separate development, ABC News reported Thursday night that
Root bounced a check for $50,000 two days before his plane plunged
into the waters off the Bahamas. Confronted with the check in a
live, nationally televised interview, Root said he would not
discuss his personal financial affairs.
   Liggett Broadcast Group Inc. of Williamston, Mich., said in its
lawsuit that it placed $75,000 in an escrow acount under Root's
control. Root refused to give the money back when asked July 18 by
Liggett's lawyers, the company complained in a U.S. District Court
suit.
   ``Root ... agreed to have no discretion in the release of the
funds if Liggett directed a return of the funds,'' the company said
in its complaint.
   The money was placed in the account in connection with Liggett's
effort to become licensee of a commercial FM broadcast station in
Portage, Mich.
   Root was accused July 19 of failing to perform work he had
agreed to do in representing investors before the Federal
Communications Commission.
   That suit was filed by Sonrise Management Services Inc. of
Columbus, Ga.
   On the program ``Prime Time'' on ABC, the network reported that
Root had written a check for $50,000 two days before his mystery
flight.
   ``I'm not going to talk about my business affairs and my
personal financial affairs,'' said Root, who again denied his
spectacular plane ride and unexplained gunshot wound were part of a
failed suicide attempt.
   ``I will tell you that financial affairs in good order or bad
order _ I think that people who take their lives or try to take
their lives need help. Something has overriden their basic will to
live,'' he said, adding that he found his ``will to live'' as he
swam in the waters below rescue planes.
   Root says he was unconscious as his private plane for six hours
from Washington's National Airport and crashed in the Atlantic
Ocean east of Miami when it ran out of fuel.
   He survived a bullet wound to the abdomen. Root says he doesn't
remember being shot.

   The family of hostage Joseph Cicippio
expressed renewed relief Thursday that his kidnappers in Lebanon
had suspended their threat of execution, but one brother said he
was heartbroken by Cicippio's appearence.
   ``Really after seeing that picture today I fell apart. That was
not the brother I knew ... four or five years ago, three years
ago,'' said Anthony Cicippio, speaking from a neighbor's house in
an interview on CNN's Larry King Live show.
   ``He's changed considerably, his face is drawn in, his eyes are
shrunken, he looks like he's malnutritioned. I really cried today
when I saw that picture. ... It was really a pathetic picture of my
brother.''
   Cicippio's Lebanese captors on Thursday released a videotaped
plea from Cicippio, who called for the release of a Shiite Moslem
cleric kidnapped by the Israelis and added: ``Don't be late ...
because they are very serious.''
   After learning that the Revolutionary Justice Organization had
suspended plans to execute Cicippio, another brother, Thomas
Cicippio, brightened and relaxed.
   ``This is very good news for the Cicippio family. We are happy
and delighted,'' he said before a battery of microphones on his
front lawn.
   Joseph Cicippio's son David said he was relieved but added:
   ``Our government has to find a solution for this crisis. We
can't just keep on reacting to things when they happen.
   ``The last 50 hours have been very devastating. I hope we never
have to go through this again.''
   The tense situation began Monday when Israel refused to free
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem religious leader captured
by Israeli commandos last week and taken to Israel.
   In retaliation, the captors of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William
Higgins, member of a U.N. peacekeeping force, said they hanged
their hostage Monday. That was followed by threats against
Cicippio's life.
   After heavy international pressure, including a plea from
Cicippio's Lebanese wife, his kidnappers postponed their Tuesday
death sentence for 48 hours and finally suspended it.
   Thomas Cicippio said he wanted to see the momentum of
negotiations continue.
   ``Other governments are involved right now; I'm not sure who
they are. I'm more hopeful now than ever, since this has gotten so
much attention,'' he said.
   Joseph Cicippio, 58, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, from the
campus of American University of Beirut, where he was acting
comptroller.
   On Thursday, his captors released a videotape of him pleading
for the United States to pressure Israel into releasing the Shiite
cleric.
   Thomas Cicippio read a telex he had sent to his sister-in-law,
Elham, in Lebanon: ``At a time like this, we are all together in
mind and heart. We are with you in our feelings. Have faith. We
will not give up hope. Keep your spirits high.''
   As the family retreated inside the house, Joseph Cicippio Jr.
paused in the doorway.
   He said the family did not plan to celebrate the suspension of
the death threat. ``We'll just have a sigh of relief at this
point,'' he said. ``We'll hold up the celebration for when my dad's
here.''

   A homeless woman was sentenced to five to 10
years in prison Wednesday in the shooting death of her boyfriend, a
Vietnam veteran involved in the 1968 My Lai massacre.
   Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Donna Jo McDaniel sentenced
Kathlynn T'Souvas, 36, for her conviction in the death of Robert
T'Souvas, 39, on Sept. 3, 1988.
   The homeless couple, who had lived together for nine years,
camped in a tent on the bank of the Monongahela River for a month.
They fished for food, sold their blood for money and worked part
time at the Jubilee Kitchen farm.
   Ms. T'Souvas told police that on the day of the shooting, she,
T'Souvas, and David Bozic, 42, another homeless person, had been
drinking and shooting rats and cans with Bozic's .22-caliber
handgun.
   Police found T'Souvas with a bullet in his head at their camp.
   During her trial in April, Ms. T'Souvas testified that her
boyfriend, who served under Lt. William Calley in Vietnam, had
become increasingly obsessed with the Vietnam War in the year
before his death. He was charged and later cleared in the 1968
massacre at the village of My Lai.
   She claimed T'Souvas shot himself in the head and that she had
tried to cover up his suicide by telling police she had shot him.

<HEAD>Soviet Spy Ship Captain Salutes Trident Missile Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Even the captain of an eavesdropping
Soviet spy ship seemed impressed by the first successful launch of
the Navy's deadly new Trident 2 missile from a submerged submarine.
   ``My best regards to the skipper of the sub,'' the Soviet
captain radioed after the 44-foot missile roared away from the USS
Tennessee, burst to the surface, ignited and hurled a dummy warhead
to a target far down the Atlantic tracking range on Wednesday.
   The message was radioed to the launch support ship Range
Sentinel. Earlier, the Range Sentinel had warned the Russian
trawler not to get too close.
   ``We're not going to interfere with the launch,'' replied the
captain of the Soviet ship, and he stayed about 2{ miles away, just
outside the security zone.
   For years, Soviet spy ships have observed most launchings from
Cape Canaveral.
   Greenpeace U.S.A. activists who oppose nuclear weapons at sea
halted the launch attempt last Friday by sailing ships into the
security zone and refusing to leave, arguing they were in
international waters. They stayed away Wednesday, saying they had
made their point.
   Following the 11 a.m. launch, Rear Adm. Arlington Campbell,
commander of Submarine Group 6, told reporters on the Range
Sentinel: ``As far as we can tell from our telemetry, it was a
totally nominal launch. From all indications, everything has been
successful.''
   The Navy did not disclose how far the warhead section traveled.
   Each of the $23.7 million missiles is designed to propel as many
as 12 nuclear warheads to different targets more than 4,600 miles
away.
   The results were far different from those of the Trident 2's
first submarine launch on March 21, when the missile cartwheeled
out of control and exploded just four seconds after it was launched
from the Tennessee.
   Investigators reported that failure was caused by a faulty
mechanical linkage responsible for moving the rocket motor nozzles
back and forth to control direction. The system was redesigned.
   ``We had one failure at sea,'' Campbell said. ``But these are
production evaluation missiles. We're here to learn. They get
improved so they are right when they are actually deployed.''
   The Navy plans seven or eight more underwater tests over the
next few months. If all goes as planned, the Navy will send the
Tennessee on operational patrol next March with 24 of the
nuclear-tipped missiles.
   Before the Trident 2 was taken to sea, the Navy conducted 19
flight tests from a land launch, rating 15 of them successful.

<HEAD>Soviets Help Clear Way Toward Settlement On Banning Chemical Weapons
Treaty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has accepted an American demand
that inspections be carried out before an agreement is formally
concluded to ban chemical weapons, The New York Times reported.
   The Times quoted unidentified officials in its Thursday editions
as saying the Soviet acceptance would help resolve one of the major
disputes remaining in the way of an agreement.
   The newspaper said the acceptance was conveyed in a paper
presented to Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d by Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union when they met
recently in Paris.
   The two countries previously had disagreed on whether chemical
weapons stockpiles should be inspected before or after a treaty is
signed.
   The United States had said they should be inspected and Moscow
had insisted that the inspections not be carried out until after a
pact is formally concluded.
   Moscow says it has no more than 50,000 tons of chemical
armaments but some analysts have said the Soviets have more than
300,000 tons.
   ``This is a sign that the Soviets are serious about concluding a
chemical-disarmament treaty,'' said Elisa D. Harris, an expert on
the chemical weapons talks at the Brookings Institution, the
Washington-based research and policy analysis institute.

   Pianist Van Cliburn finally is getting
a platinum record for his album that became the first classical LP
to sell a million.
   RCA records Wednesday presented Cliburn with the award for his
1958 recording of Tchaikovsky's ``Piano Concerto No. 1'' with
conductor Kiril Kondrashin and the RCA Symphony.
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Cliburn's album
passed 2 million in sales in 1967 and 2.5 million copies in 1970;
sales reached 1 million by 1961.
   RCA officials would not disclose the number of copies that have
been sold. A company spokeswoman said she was uncertain why a
platinum record had not been bestowed earlier.
   Cliburn, 55, recently announced plans to live part time in
Moscow and that Raisa Gorbachev, the Soviet leader's wife, is
helping him find an apartment.

   No sooner had Michael J. Fox finished playing a
son on the last episode of the sitcom ``Family Ties'' than he
became a father in real life.
   ``The last two months have been just wild,'' he told US magazine
on the set of ``Back to the Future, Part II'' after the May 30
birth of Sam Michael Fox.
   The 28-year-old Fox said he's ``a pretty soft touch right now.''
   ``I don't know what I'm saying because I'm still screwed up _ in
a really good way,'' he said in the magazine's Aug. 21 issue.
   After Fox completes work on Brian DePalma's Vietnam drama,
``Casualties of War,'' and several other projects, he'll take a
break with his son and his wife, actress Tracy Pollan, at their
100-acre property in South Woodstock, Vt.
   There, they'll ``watch the dogs chase the sheep around,'' he
said.

   Milton Berle and Red Buttons led mourners
during an often humorous memorial service for Jim Backus, who died
last month.
   ``We thank the good Lord for sending Jim Backus to us,'' Berle
told about 30 people who gathered for the Directors Guild of
America service Wednesday.
   The comedian added: ``When Jim was born, there was a star in the
East _ me.''
   Backus, the voice of the myopic Mr. Magoo cartoon character and
star of the old ``Gilligan's Island'' TV series, died July 3 after
a lengthy bout with pneumonia. He was 76.
   ``He was a clown, but he was a damned good actor,'' said Ann
Doran, who played James Dean's mother to Backus' father role in
``Rebel Without a Cause.''
   Berle recalled visiting his longtime friend at the hospital,
saying he told Backus jokes for two hours one day. ``As I left I
turned to him and said, `I hope you get better,' and he said, `You,
too,''' Berle recalled.
   Buttons called Backus a ``quiet, simple, unassuming craftsman,''
adding: ``He wore the mantle of celebrity with charm and grace.''

   Zsa Zsa Gabor may see any
misconduct complaint in the personnel file of the policeman who
arrested her following a street confrontation, a judge ruled.
   Municipal Judge Charles G. Rubin issued the order during a
pretrial hearing Wednesday, focusing on the file of Officer Paul
Kramer, whom Miss Gabor has described as an ``empty-headed,
gorgeous man'' and a ``sadist.''
   Kramer arrested Miss Gabor on June 14 after he ordered her to
pull her car over so he could investigate a registration violation
and she drove off as he checked for other infractions. When he
stopped her two blocks later, she allegedly backhanded him across
the face, knocking off his glasses.
   Authorities charged Miss Gabor with misdemeanor battery on a
policeman, disobeying a policeman's orders, driving with an expired
license, having an open container of alcohol in her car and
carrying an expired registration.
   The defense for Miss Gabor contends the officer has a history of
harassment against celebrities and that Miss Gabor was defending
herself.

   Olympic gold medalist Greg Louganis has
settled a lawsuit against his former housemate and business manager
who was allegedly threatening the champion diver.
   ``The lawsuit has been amicably resolved,'' Louganis' attorney,
Pat Benson, said Wednesday. No details were disclosed.
   Louganis, who won gold medals for springboard and platform
diving in both the 1984 and 1988 Summer Games, has turned to an
acting career.
   In March, Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs ordered R. James
Babbitt to stay at least 500 feet away from Louganis unless they
mutually agreed to closer contact. But the judge refused to order
Babbitt out of the Malibu home they shared for four years.
   On March 13, Louganis fired Babbitt, his manager for six years,
and the Olympic champ alleged that Babbitt threatened to make
public ``confidential and private facts'' about him unless Louganis
rehired or compensated him.
   Babbitt also had threatened to destroy the 29-year-old Louganis'
personal belongings and to shoot him if he tried to enter the
house, the diver said. Babbitt has said he never harassed Louganis.

   The 10-year-old boy's voice dropped to a
tired whisper as he told how he helped keep his great-grandfather
alive in the woods after their truck ran off a remote logging road.
   ``I picked berries. I snuggled up by him,'' Mike Combs said from
his hospital bed, where he was being treated for dehydration and
exposure.
   Mike and his 84-year-old great-grandfather, John C. Eveland,
were lost for 4{ days in a remote area in southwestern Washington
state. The pair was found by searchers early Wednesday.
   Eveland was listed in serious but stable condition after
suffering dehydration, and possibly a stroke, said Jennifer
Strozyk, a spokeswoman at Providence Hospital in Centralia, 80
miles south of Seattle.
   Eveland's great-grandson could be released today, nursing
supervisor Molly Oster said Wednesday night.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, this little fellow saved my daddy,''
said Joy Norton, Mike's grandmother.
   She stroked the boy's hand as he struggled to stay awake long
enough to answer reporters' questions. ``He's a hero in my book.''
   The two got lost Friday after Eveland finished a sheep-shearing
job in the small town of Doty. They were found about 20 miles to
the south, the opposite direction from the boy's home in Centralia
and Eveland's in Rochester.
   The elderly man backed his truck into a ditch while turning
around on a remote road, Lewis County sheriff's officers said,
stranding the two without food, water, or matches to build a fire.
   When the pair tried to walk out for help, Eveland's knees gave
out and he fell down a rock hill, the youngster said. After that,
Eveland fell several more times and became increasingly
disoriented, authorities added.
   Their truck was found by bear hunters Tuesday and a bloodhound
helped find the pair about a mile away before dawn Wednesday.
   Mike said he remembered his father's advice if he ever got lost
in the woods: ```Stay close to the road and eat berries.' ...
That's what I did.''
   ``There was a creek far away but I didn't want to go there,''
said Mike, adding he stayed close to his great-grandfather.
   The two slept under a tree and on the road, he said.
   ``It rained lots,'' and the two were often cold and wet, the boy
said. Overnight temperatures dipped into the 40s.
   ``I prayed that someone would come. Last night I prayed that the
rescue mission ... would come,'' Mike said.
   Searchers said the pair apparently walked in circles trying to
stay close to the old logging road.
   More than 100 volunteers helped in the search, family members
said.
   ``We want to thank everybody for all their help from the bottom
of our hearts,'' said Joy Eveland, daughter-in-law of John Eveland.

<HEAD>Hurricane Dean, With 80 mph Winds, Rumbles Through Eastern Caribbean</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with current storm position, moves
higher details of threat to Barbuda. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Officials warned residents of the
U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and nearby islands to bolt down
everything loose and stock up on food and water Wednesday as
Hurricane Dean rumbled through the eastern Caribbean.
   Dean was upgraded from a tropical storm to the second hurricane
of the Atlantic season Wednesday, and by nightfall the National
Weather Center in Puerto Rico reported the hurricane's winds had
strengthened to 80 mph.
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Leeward Islands from
Antigua to the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, said
forecasters at the National Hurricane Center near Miami.
   At midnight EDT, forecasters reported the center of the
hurricane was at latitude 18.5 north and longitude 61.3 west,
moving westerly at 15 mph. Its latest position was 310 miles east
of Puerto Rico, 65 miles northeast of Barbuda and about 240 miles
east of St. Thomas.
   The storm was moving over warm tropical waters at 15 mph, down
slightly from the 20 mph it had sustained much of the day. But
forecasters said some strengthening was possible in the next 24
hours.
   An advisory issued by the National Weather Service in San Juan
for the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico advised residents to
``secure loose objects or move them indoors,'' board or tape
windows and stock up on emergency supplies such as drinking water,
food that needs no refrigeration and batteries.
   ``This is a dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly,
even though it is a minimal hurricane,'' it said. ``Don't take
chances. It could lead to injuries or even death.''
   In San Juan, a city of 1.1 million people, shoppers formed long
lines in supermarkets, workers boarded up windows of the governor's
mansion and stores in the tourist district of Old San Juan.
   A hurricane advisory said aircraft reports indicated Dean's
center was moving westward after making a temporary jog northwest.
``This increases the threat to the northern Leeward islands,'' it
said.
   Forecasters said the storm was expected to first hit land in
Barbuda, the easternmost Leeward Island and move northwest toward
the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico over the next 24 to 36
hours.
   Government radio in the twin island state of Antigua and Barbuda
said Dean was expected to hit Barbuda on Wednesday night, and
warned residents to bar windows, latch down loose objects and stock
up on water.
   Barbuda is a flat, 62-square-mile coral island with a population
of 1,200 and little industry or tourism.
   A hurricane warning for Guadeloupe was dropped, as was a
hurricane watch for Dominica and Martinique.
   In Coral Gables, Fla., hurricane specialist Jim Gross called
Dean a small hurricane, with hurricane-force winds confined to
within 25 miles of its center.
   Rainfall of 4 to 8 inches and tides 2 to 4 feet above normal
were said to be possible in the storm's path.
   Authorities broadcast similar warnings in several nearby islands.
   Dean grew from the fifth tropical depression of the season
Monday morning into a named storm by Monday night.
   Three other storms have formed since the season began June 1.
   Tropical Storm Allison, caused widespread flooding in Texas and
Louisiana in June. Barry churned up the open Atlantic last month
before dissipating.
   Chantal became a hurricane Monday and was downgraded to a
tropical depression Tuesday night after hitting land in Texas.

   When Charles Cooper's girlfriend
won a $19.5 million jackpot, he had more than the money to
celebrate.
   The night she bought the winning ticket, Cooper had offered a
variation on his frequent proposal of marriage. ``If you win the
lottery,'' he said, ``will you marry me?''
   ``Sure,'' Christene Lentz responded.
   A year later, she fulfilled her promise. On July 15, the Orange
County couple were married. They returned this week from a
honeymoon in Florida at Walt Disney World.
   ``We couldn't have gotten engaged if I hadn't won the lottery,''
said Mrs. Cooper, 21. ``But since we had the money and we had
talked about it so many times ...''
   Her 20-year-old husband said he once feared his nouveau riche
girlfriend would change her mind. ``I was nervous at first because
I didn't think she would like me anymore,'' he said.
   But she said ``I do'' as she spent her money. Mrs. Cooper bought
a BMW, a yacht and a $500 Gucci purse for herself, and she bought
houses for her aunt and grandmother.
   The Coopers plan to build their own fantasy house with a bowling
alley, dance floor, video jukebox and toy trains in the living room.
   After her first year as a millionaire, Mrs. Cooper finds herself
living from $723,000 check to $723,000 check. ``I have enough money
to get me through to the end of next month,'' she said. ``That's
when the next check comes.''
   The Coopers insist the money has not changed them.

   Childhood fantasies of celebrating
Christmas year-round come true in southwestern Illinois, where
Alfred Meyers refuses to take down his artificial, seven-foot
scotch tree.
   ``I used to live in a little house across the street, and we
could only keep it up a short time,'' the septuagenarian said
recently. ``Here, I've got all this space. I don't have to take it
down, so I keep it up.''
   Shining through the picture window of the Meyers' home in
Hartford, a town of about 1,900 people across the Mississippi River
northeast of St. Louis, the tree has been a fixture for the past
three years.
   Meyers said the tree, decorated with some ornaments that are
more than 40 years old, is a conversation piece with local
residents.
   ``This is a fairly small town. The families are still able to
get out and walk around at night,'' he said. ``I hear the people _
and especially the kids _ go by and say, `See, I told you it was
up.'''
   Keeping the tree up throughout the year does not diminish the
Christmas spirit, Meyers said; rather, it extends the holiday to
every day of the year.
   ``To me, when I see the kids go by that Christmas tree and get a
smile on their face, it's all worth it,'' Meyers said.

   Growers of sweet potatoes, claiming their
product's character is being maligned, want to divorce the
vegetable from other potatoes by giving it a new name _ sweetpotato.
   ``We could call it the `love spud,''' said Virginia Tech
vegetable specialist Charlie O'Dell, referring to a campaign once
developed for tomatoes as ``love apples.''
   Sweet potato advocates, whose efforts to promote the product as
yams resulted in only half-baked success, have no love for the
starchy image of the ordinary potato.
   ``Yam never was a good word,'' said Bill Mapp, regional
marketing manager with the Virginia Department of Agriculture and
Consumer Services. ``It's a Madison Avenue word.''
   The campaign for sweetpotato has its origins in the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, which has used one word to denote the
product for some time, said Billy Yeargin, executive director of
the North Carolina Sweetpotato Commission.
   ``Their contention is that to refer to it as two words is
inaccurate because it refers to a potato that is sweet,'' said
Yeargin, whose commission dropped ``Yam'' from its name in January.
   So what does a sweet potato marketing official do when he wants
to change the name of his spud? Go to the dictionary. Yeargin's
commission tried that, but the effort was a dud.
   ``A dictionary doesn't have anything to do with deciding whether
sweet potato should be one word,'' said Victoria Neufeldt, editor
in chief at Webster's New World Dictionary. ``What we use is
usage.''

   A luxury commuter bus that features a

downtown San Francisco.
   ``It's kind of like being on vacation,'' said financial
consultant Jim Chisolm, one of the passengers aboard the Execucoach
for its inaugural trip into the city Tuesday. ``This is actually
nicer than my office.''
   Execucoach Inc. President Mark Wixom thinks executives are
willing to pay the introductory price of $149.95 per month for the

Golden Gate Transit.
   ``I think it's the same ideology that prompts somebody to buy a

   The $120,000 coach has smoked windows, a blue Naugahyde

   President Bush expressed fears for the safety
of Americans held hostage in Lebanon on Wednesday and said he was
hampered by a lack of information, but NBC News said the president
had made up his mind to retaliate if another hostage is killed.
   The network said it had been told by unidentified ``senior
administration officials'' that Bush ``has decided to strike back
at the Lebanese Shiites and their Iranian sponsors'' if his
diplomatic moves failed to prevent the death of the next hostage.
   Just what form this retaliation would take was not specified.
   A senior Defense Department official, asked about the report,
said Wednesday evening, ``I know of no such decision.'' This
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, noted that Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney left Washington during the day for a visit to
his home state of Wyoming and said, ``There is a distinct
atmosphere of un-crisis around here.''
   Another administration official said a message to Iran, the
existence of which was disclosed on Tuesday, had said in substance
``if anything happens to the hostages we hold you responsible,''
and was conveyed to Tehran trhough two channels, the Swiss embassy
representing U.S. interests there and through another government he
declined to name. This official discussed the message on condition
of anonymity.
   Bush sought help from more world leaders and, for the third time
in three days, met with top military, diplomatic and national
security advisers in the Cabinet Room to review developments in the
hostage crisis. The White House said no further sessions were
scheduled.
   ``We are leaving no stone unturned,'' Bush said.
   He said he had been incontact with many world leaders, including
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in telephone calls during
the day.
   ``They face the same problems that we face when it comes to
information and trying to find out exactly what happened,'' Bush
said. ``We are not dealing with all the facts.
   ``But I've had assurance after assurance from world leaders that
they want to help,'' the president said.
   On the eve of the threatened execution by kidnappers of American
hostage Joseph Cicippio, Bush was asked if he feared the hostages
were in peril. Alluding to the threats, Bush replied, ``Well, we're
considering that that might well be the case, given statements that
we've seen.''
   However, Shiite Moslem sources in Lebanon said they expected
Cicippio's captors to spare him at Iran's behest to avert a
confrontation with the United States. International tension already
was high after the reported execution Monday of Marine Lt. Col.
William Higgins.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration was pleased with a statement by Iran's
President-elect Hashemi Rafsanjani condemning the killing of
Higgins and all acts of a terrorist nature.
   She called on Rafsanjani to act ``in accordance with the
spirit'' of his statement. ``We remain convinced that Iran is in a
position to bring significant influence to bear on those who hold
the hostages and call on it to do so,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She also welcomed a statement by a top aide to Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat criticizing the
execution of Higgins.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said the USS Belknap, the flagship
of the U.S. 6th Fleet, and the fleet's commander canceled a
scheduled visit to the Soviet port of Sevastapol to be ``at the
beck and call'' of Bush in case he needs them.
   The aircraft carrier USS America also cut short a visit and left
the port of Singapore, officials said.
   ``We're prudently planning,'' Bush said of the military moves.
   On the other hand, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
advised reporters ``not to read a lot into those movements ... I
would not attach a great deal of significance to them.''
   Bush, posing for pictures in the Oval Office with the visiting
foreign minister of the Persian Gulf nation of Bahrain, Sheik
Mohammed bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, said the administration was
dealing with the hostage crisis ``with a heavy heart'' because of
Higgins' reported death.
   ``We are thinking prudently about this matter in every possible
way,'' the president said. ``We have exercised every diplomatic
channel that I can think of. ...
   ``We've been in touch _ I have, personally, with many world
leaders, and our State Department has fleshed his out, so we're
leaving no stone unturned,'' Bush said.
   ``But regrettably ... we're dealing with less than a full deck
when it comes to information,'' he added. ``It is very hard when
you're dealing with this kind of cowardice and this kind of
dastardly act to get all the information that you need to make a
decision.''
   Afterward, Sheik Mohammed told reporters outside the White House
that, ``I think in the next few days something must come to stop
this kind of killing of innocent people.''
   The president was asked by reporters if it would make matters
easier if Israel released the Moslem cleric whose kidnapping by
Israel inflamed the hostage situation.
   ``I have made clear the position of the United States that I
think a release of everyone held against their will would be a good
thing,'' Bush replied.
   Separately, Fitzwater said the United States has not asked
Israel to release the cleric, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid.
   The official who discussed the message to Iran said the United
States had told Israel, through the embassies in Washington and Tel
Aviv, on several occasions that it ``neither approves nor
disapproves'' Israel's proposed swap of Obeid for hostages held by
the Shiites.
   Bush and White House officials made a deliberate attempt to
quell any suggestion that the administration was paralyzed by
crisis.
   ``I don't want anyone in this country or around the world to
think that it (the hotage ordeal) is anything of other than
tremendous concern,'' Bush said. ``But we must prudently move on
with the business of our country.''
   Administration officials said a study of a videotape purporting
to show Higgins dead by hanging was inconclusive as to the identity
of the victim or when the victim was killed.
   ``There are those who think the circumstantial evidence from the
videotape would indicate that the victim did not die by hanging,
however there is is no conclusive proof of that or any proof of
when it happened,'' said one official, insisting on anonymity.
   The New York Times said in Thursday editions that the CIA had
told the White House it believed Higgins was probably killed before
Monday, according to unidentified officials who said the conclusion
was based in part on ``conversations'' with nations in contact with
the Hezbollah. A call to CIA spokesmen Wednesday night was not
immediately returned.
   In another development, the Senate displayed growing frustration
with terrorist kidnappings and murders, voting to instruct the CIA
and Pentagon to report by Sept. 1 on how best to locate and rescue
American hostages in Lebanon.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., meanwhile, said his
criticism of Israel this week was not helping terrorists drive a
wedge between the United States and the Jewish state, as critics
contended.
   ``My basic message to Israel is this. We are in this together.
We both have vital interests at stake. Whenever possible we ought
to act together. And always we ought to take fully into account the
vital interests of the other, when we contemplate unilateral
action,'' Dole said.

<HEAD>Bob Dole: Controversy is no Stranger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As soon as Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole
heard that Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins had reportedly been
hanged by terrorists, he headed for the Senate floor.
   He didn't have a text prepared or need a meeting with his staff.
He delivered a blunt assessment of how he believed Israel might
have provoked the murder.
   ``We cannot apologize for Israeli actions in this country, when
it endangers the lives of Americans in some far-off country, and
perhaps a little more responsibility on the part of the Israelis
one of these days would be refreshing,'' he said, a bitter edge to
his voice.
   Dole's remarks sparked outrage from defenders of the Jewish
state, who said he was playing into the hands of the terrorists
themselves.
   It was ``a contemptible slander'' that showed ``the gullibility
of its utterer,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif. ``It is
precisely what the murderers want people to think.''
   But for Dole, jumping into controversy was nothing new. His
stinging comments about Israel fit in a political style which has
put him at the pinnacle of Senate politics, even if it has
sometimes hurt his ambitions for national office.
   ``He enjoys it. Bob enjoys being in the middle of the fray. He
usually can handle it every well,'' says Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, his
Kansas Republican colleague. ``It's something that really sparks an
energy. He likes a good political fight,'' she said.
   Dole's zest for the jugular of an issue or an opponent has not
always served him well. It hurt him in 1976, when as Gerald Ford's
running mate he earned a reputation as a mean campaigner.
   More than a decade later, in losing the New Hampshire primary to
George Bush last year, Dole's ``mean'' image resurfaced when he
angrily blurted that the then-vice president should ``stop lying
about my record.''
   Dole took more criticism for the remark than Bush ever took for
his hardball campaign, and it might have cost Dole another vice
presidential nomination.
   But within the Senate, Dole's sometimes mercurial personality is
accepted as his style, raising the stakes when he wants a point to
be made.
   ``It's nothing more than Bob Dole on course,'' said Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo. ``He is our leader, and I think he does a
magnificent job.''
   Often Dole _ Senate minority leader for the last 4{ years _ acts
in the role of a team player, such as his strong partisan attacks
on Democrats who refused to back the nomination of John Tower as
secretary of defense.
   This week, Dole suggested President Bush make a recess
appointment of William Lucas, the nominee to head the civil rights
division of the Justice Department.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee killed Lucas' nomination on a 7-7
vote. A recess appointment would go around the normal confirmation
process and put Lucas in the post through the end of next year _
and would almost certainly provoke open warfare between the
Democratic Congress and the Republican White House.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said Wednesday he was
seriously considering it.
   In the case of Israel, Dole was seen by many as saying what the
White House couldn't say for diplomatic reasons.
   ``He went further than I would have gone. But I don't think it's
ever a bad thing for a message to go out that an ally should not be
taken for granted,'' said Rep. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman of
the Senate Intelligence Committee.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., a freshman who disagrees with Dole on
Israel, said the statement in no way lowered his opinion of Dole.
   ``To be leader of this group, you have to be able to work with
all different factions,'' Mack said. ``He is a leader.''
   ``Whether one agrees or not, the point of it is it's consistent
with describing his role here,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M.
   While there was talk after last year's bruising political
campaign that Dole would somehow get revenge on Bush when he
returned to the Senate, the Kansan has proven a loyal soldier.
   ``He has laid himself on the line for George Bush since we
opened for business, and George Bush knows it and Bob Dole knows
it,'' said Simpson.
   Dole and Bush have patched up any hard feelings and if there is
any bitterness remaining between Dole and White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu, who helped Bush bring down Dole, they won't let
that come out, Simpson said.
   If Dole still harbors any national ambitions, he knows that
``the key to his success is support of this president,'' Simpson
said. ``Bob never looks back.''

<HEAD>`Senators' Still Striking Out</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly two decades after their perennially
woeful baseball namesake skipped town, the only senators left in
Washington are still striking out in the major leagues.
   In a semi-annual ritual that so far has produced nothing but
vague promises and veiled threats, baseball's commissioner
Wednesday once again fended off congressional demands to expand
major league baseball.
   It was A. Bartlett Giamatti's second turn at confronting the
special Senate task force representing the franchise hopes of at
least a dozen cities.
   And like his predecessors, he threw its score of members a
gentlemanly curve and still shut them out.
   ``He stood there like a stone wall,'' Sen. John Warner, R-Va.,
said in mock disbelief.
   The senators, joined by two House members at the closed-door
meeting, pressed Giamatti for a commitment to expand the American
League by at least two teams and the National League by at least
four. The AL has 14 teams, the NL 12.
   Giamatti would only repeat the commitment of NL owners to add
two teams at some indefinite date in the 1990s.
   ``In our view, there are six or eight cities which are very
strongly qualified'' for a major league team, said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., who has Phoenix uppermost on that list.
   But Giamatti wouldn't budge.
   ``It is a fact that two is not six. It is not eight. It is not
10,'' he told reporters after the meeting. ``Our disagreement is
about the pace and about the number.''
   Several senators, including Democrat Timothy Wirth of Colorado,
chairman of the Senate Task Force on the Expansion of Major League
Baseball, alluded to the possibility that Congress could repeal
baseball's special exemption from antitrust law if owners don't
respond swiftly to expansion demands.
   That threat has often been aired, but never enacted by members
whose constituents don't live in prospective expansion cities.
   In a letter presented to Giamatti at the meeting, Wirth said the
task force ``is preparing to pursue all available avenues to
correct the inequities of the existing expansion procedure.''
   ``Though we would prefer to develop a mutually satisfactory
expansion plan with baseball, it is time to move this process out
of discussions and into action,'' Wirth said.
   ``It has been more than a decade since the last franchises, the
Toronto Blue Jays and the Seattle Mariners, were awarded. The
addition of only two teams in the last 20 years, coupled with the
possibility of only two more in the next decade, clearly is not
responsive to the fans and cities that desire and can support major
league baseball.''
   The Washington Senators left the nation's capital after the 1971
season and became the Texas Rangers.
   Giamatti told reporters ``there weren't any promises made,''
other than to return for more discussion at an indefinite date,
possibly at public hearings.
   Warner confronted Giamatti after the meeting about his claim
that not enough talent is available to preserve the quality of the
game if several new teams are added at once.
   ``What I said was that it is more difficult to step off a
college baseball field into the major leagues'' than in other
sports, Giamatti replied. ``To expand is not to say you degrade
quality. But one must be responsible, deliberate and prudent.''
   Warner and others didn't buy that.
   ``The pool of talent is expanding very rapidly,'' said Sen. Dan
Coats, R-Ind. ``Colleges are now taking baseball very seriously.''
   Other members of the task force, all representing states with
one or more cities hoping to land an expansion team, were: Sens.
William L. Armstrong, R-Colo.; John Breaux, D-La.; Alan Cranston,
D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; Albert
Gore Jr., D-Tenn.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.;
   Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind.; Connie
Mack, R-Fla.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio; Charles S. Robb, D-Va.;
James R. Sasser, D-Tenn.; Pete Wilson, R-Calif.; Rep. Jim Bunning,
R-Ky.; and District of Columbia non-voting Delegate Walter E.
Fauntroy, a Democrat.

   Jesse Abney, a chemical worker at the Fernald
nuclear weapons plant, says he doesn't want to see the Ohio
facility close down because it will mean a loss of jobs. But he
feels a sense of betrayal.
   It is at Fernald, he told a congressional hearing Wednesday,
that he became contaminated with plutonium and uranium despite
assurances over the years from supervisors that health risks were
minimal.
   David Day, another worker and union official at the Fernald
plant _ where investigators have documented widespread abuses in
environmental and health safeguards _ says he too relied on those
assurances.
   ``We were told the levels (of contamination) were too low to
harm us,'' he told the Senate Government Operations Committee.
Superiors told him a decade ago the radioactive substance he
handled ``was like working with lead'' and involved no more risk
than crossing the street, he said.
   ``We are the guinea pigs,'' added Abney, 55. ``We perform
important and dangerous work, but are made to feel expendable.''
Recent tests showed unhealthy levels of plutonium in his body and
uranium contamination in his lungs.
   Workers and union officials said there are similar stories at
the other major 17 weapons plants in a dozen states. Government
investigations are probing violations of safety and environmental
laws at a number of plants. The cleanup effort and bringing the
plants into compliance nationwide may cost more than $100 billion
and take 30 or more years.
   ``Contractors have ignored safety rules with the complicity of
(Energy Department) officials. Information documenting radioactive
releases and poor safety practices has been withheld from the
public and the extent of the hazards covered up by DOE,'' Margaret
Seminario, a health expert with the AFL-CIO, told the Senate panel.
   Other union officials said some workers are still reluctant to
complain.
   ``The cloak of secrecy (which kept workers for years unaware of
safety hazards) for the most part has disappeared and been replaced
by the threat of unemployment,'' said Day, who is head of a union
local at Fernald.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins acknowledged in separate
testimony Wednesday that the department's program to track health
risks at the weapons plants is ``a mess'' and that the department
has given workers past assurances of safety without an accurate
reading of the health risks involved.
   When he took over the department in March, Watkins said he found
the program for monitoring and evaluating health risks ``buried
deep within the bureaucracy ... understaffed, under-funded and
under-utilized'' with no outside scrutiny.
   ``The historical record provides little comfort,'' said Sen.
John Glenn, D-Ohio, committee chairman.
   The committee produced a list of 30 reports and studies over the
years that describe health problems among workers and residents
near the Energy Department facilities since the 1950s.
   Robert Wages, a union official representing 5,000 atomic weapons
plants workers across the country, said the Energy Department's
record on worker health and safety issues at the plants has been
``one of denial, coverup, inefficiency and betrayal.''
   Wages, a vice president of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
Union, said concerns about worker exposure to radioactive materials
and wastes at the plants were debated in Congress nearly two
decades ago, but little was improved.
   Watkins promised a shakeup in the department's health monitoring
program and said it will be opened to review by an outside
committee of experts.
   Watkins told the senators he plans to rely heavily on outside
review panels because he can't trust internal department
statistics. ``Sometimes the reports coming in from the field are
not really true,'' said the secretary.

<TEXT>
   The four Manhattan lawyers chanted, shrieked and
slapped themselves. Not their usual work-day behavior.
   But they were on a stage, performing Wednesday night in a
festival called Serious Fun at the usually serious Alice Tully Hall.
   The piece by performance artist and choreographer Ann Carlson
was called ``Sloss, Kerr, Rosenberg &amp; Moore'' _ for John, Chet,
Scott and Tom, the real-life lawyers who star in it.
   In the piece, a work of performance art, Ms. Carlson examines
the lives of lawyers.
   ``I think this is our 15 minutes of fame,'' said Sloss, an
entertainment lawyer.
   ``I never really thought I'd be appearing at Lincoln Center
onstage,'' said Moore, a corporate lawyer, before the big moment.
``My God, this is really something.''
   Their feet firmly grounded in an invisible box, the lawyers do
dance-like interpretations, alternately frenzied, fidgeting and
mellow. They call a cab, go to the beach, ride a roller coaster and
see their suits smudged by puppies.
   At one point, each lawyer recites something he learned in
childhood: his address, a prayer, the months of the year.
   Ms. Carlson's life gets equal time, when Rosenberg points
accusingly at the audience and yells, ``You're the biggest baby in
this room!''
   ``It happened to me in the second grade; it was traumatic,'' Ms.
Carlson said.
   At the end, ``their lawyerishness sort of drops away,'' said Ms.
Carlson. They take rose petals out of their breast pockets, sniff
them and drop them onto the floor. They lunge out of their box and
notice each other.
   ``I have friends in the audience tonight _ but I was somewhat
selective about the people I notified,'' said Moore. ``Some people
think it's kind of strange or weird. I've gotten a little bit of
ribbing. But most people are very positive.''
   The program of works by 10 contemporary dance or performance
companies also was highlighted by the Second Hand Dance Company's
``Clackers,'' in which a precision dance trio kicked percussion
instruments strapped to their derrieres, and ``3B49,'' a whimsical
dance portrayal of a taxi driver and passenger by Blondell Cummings
and Tom Thayer.
   The lawyers were ``discovered'' in 1985.
   Ms. Carlson, living near Wall Street, noticed ``the visual
climate around me was mostly three-piece suits and briefcases. I
had this dream where these four men in suits had their shoes glued
to the floor.''
   She asked Kerr, a civil litigator and former high school
classmate from Park Ridge, Ill., to bring over three lawyer buddies
to talk about themselves and experiment with dance. She also spent
time at a law firm, observing lawyers' movements and attitudes.
   What evolved was a 9-minute work with lawyers who ``look like
they're running around and getting nowhere.''
   ``It's a very frenetic piece, reflective of the way we often
work,'' said Kerr. ``We spend little time in the piece
communicating with each other.''
   ``In a way, lawyers have a bad rap sometimes,'' said Ms.
Carlson. ``The suit, a power icon in our culture, and the lawyers'
vulnerability, is a paradox that has a lot of resonance. My
challenge was to blow the stereotype apart _ let it explode.''
   The lawyers have performed at the Whitney Museum and the Central
Park band shell. Moore once cut short travel in China to perform at
the Brooklyn Academy of Music; Kerr convinced his colleagues to do
an impromptu performance at his wedding.
   The piece spawned a series called Real People, starring
basketball players, fly fishermen, mothers and daughters. A
different work, featuring blind people, was just performed at the
Jacob's Pillow festival.
   ``I'm trying to change the nature of traditional performance
work,'' Ms. Carlson said. ``I'm interested in extending performance
into the public, creating something that can empower people.''

<TEXT>
   Korean Air Lines says it will appeal a $50
million verdict awarded by a jury that ruled a KAL crew acted with
willful misconduct by straying into Soviet airspace, an action that
led to the jet being shot down.
   All 269 people aboard the jumbo jet, including 61 Americans,
died Sept. 1, 1983, when the plane was hit by a missile fired by a
Russian military jet.
   The six-member jury awarded $50 million in punitive damages
Wednesday, a day after beginning deliberations.
   Families of a total of 137 victims will share equally in the
award, said lawyer Milton Sincoff. The decision also will allow the
families to seek actual damages in federal courts.
   Without the finding of willful misconduct, the families would
have been limited to compensation of $75,000 per passenger, a
figure set by international treaty.
   KAL lawyer George Tompkins said after the verdict that the
evidence doesn't support the jury's finding and that KAL will
appeal.
   A KAL motion to dismiss the case is pending before U.S. District
Court Judge Aubrey Robinson. The airline also could file a motion
with Robinson to set aside the verdict.
   Tompkins said it was not believable, as suggested by lawyers for
the families during the two-week civil trial, that the crew flew
for hours over Soviet territory and radioed false position reports.
   Two expert witnesses, former pilots testifying for the
plaintiffs, theorized that Flight 007 spent several hours in Soviet
airspace after the crew accidentally misprogrammed one or more of
the plane's computerized navigation systems before taking off from
Anchorage, Alaska.
   Shortly after takeoff, a KAL captain on a flight 14 minutes
behind Flight 007 said he spoke by radio with the doomed airliner
and that the pilot's voice ``was under stress or tension.''
   Testifying on videotape, that KAL captain said he was ``under
the impression something truly out of the ordinary was occurring.''
The pilot aboard Flight 007 reported experiencing strong head
winds, while the other KAL plane did not, even though both aircraft
were flying in the same area.
   Tompkins said the KAL captain on the videotape was a
``disgruntled employee'' who had sought unsuccessfully to remain a
pilot past normal retirement.
   Tompkins said the crew aboard Flight 007 radioed a position
report saying it was on course over the Pacific Ocean about an hour
before it was downed.
   However, Tompkins acknowledged that ``something happened'' in
the final hour of flight because some of the plane's wreckage was
recovered in the Sea of Japan, hundreds of miles from Flight 007's
scheduled flight path.
   Sincoff said the families of the dead passengers ``feel they
received a fair measure of justice.''
   The families said in a statement that ``many unanswered
questions still remain'' about Flight 007.
   Their comment echoes that of Judge Robinson.
   At the start of the trial, Robinson said ``there are people'' in
the U.S. and Soviet governments ``who know exactly where this plane
was shot down and how it got there.''
   Due to national security concerns, ``nobody will breathe a word
about it,'' Robinson said, speaking out of the presence of the jury.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As this island of 20 million inches toward
democracy, a 30-year-old model has gained notoriety with a
political campaign that relies on maximum exposure _ nudity.
   Hsu Hsiao-dan is running, sometimes naked, for a seat in
Taiwan's Yuan legislature in the first election since the lifting
of martial law two years ago.
   Like the raucous chair-throwing sessions and fights that break
out in the Yuan, Hsu's unusual campaign for the December vote
indicates how much the island has changed since martial law.
   During the 38 years that Taiwan lived under military rule, Hsu
might have been locked up for stripping in public and demanding
greater freedom and free love. Now, Taiwan's version of Cicciolina,
the Italian porn star who won a seat in parliament, has become the
most talked about woman on this island.
   Every major newspaper has carried her half-naked picture.
In-depth interviews on her sex life have appeared in leading
magazines.
   And although the ``little cabbage,'' as she's called, is not
expected to win, her campaign has added spice to Taiwan's changing
political scene.
   ``My body is a political weapon,'' laughs Hsu, as she snuggles
with one of her three cats in her downtown Taipei apartment. ``My
breasts are nuclear warheads.''
   A slight woman with thick eyebrows and an easy smile, Hsu is
recognized everywhere she goes. Men tend to grin broadly and woman
hiss when she walks by.
   Hsu has catalogued her fame in three notebooks, filled with
newspaper stories revealing her exploits. She has crammed several
other photo albums with her nude pictures. She shows these with
pride.
   ``When I dream, I am naked,'' she says. ``What is more beautiful
than that?''
   Since last year, when Hsu first stripped to make a political
point, she has been arrested several times, sentenced to 40 days in
jail and fined. She remains serious about her campaign.
   Public opinion is mixed.
   ``By stripping off her clothes, she is ripping the mask of
hypocrisy from Taiwan,'' said one government official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Others criticize her as a politically naive publicity hound.
   ``Elections always produce crazy people like that,'' said
Antonio Chiang, editor of Taiwan's top news magazine, The
Journalist.
   Hsu recently appeared on the steps of the legislature to demand
more democracy in Taiwan. She had planned to stand there for one
hour, posing as a model of the Goddess of Democracy, erected during
the movement for freedom in Communist China's Tiananmen Square. But
when she exposed her breasts, female police officers bundled her
off to jail. She was released later that day.
   ``I was there to say that Taiwan has no right to gloat over the
communist crackdown,'' she says. ``We need more changes in our
country, too.''
   Hsu is running for one of the 12 seats of the Legislative Yuan
in the Kaohsiung district, Taiwan's second-largest city. She will
be on the ballot as an independent, not affiliated with the ruling
Nationalist Party or the main opposition group, the Democratic
Progressive Party.
   The Yuan is dominated by members in their 70's or older who were
last elected in 1948 on the Chinese mainland. They were given
permanent posts because the Nationalist government, which fled to
Taiwan following the Communist revolution, still claims to be the
legitimate ruler of all China.
   The government has instituted a series of political reforms,
steps that are needed for the Yuan to shed its rubber-stamp image.
   Hsu, the daughter of a tailor and a housewife, comes from the
Taiwanese countryside. She attended prestigious Donghai University,
studying history, but spent most of her time cavorting with local
artists.
   In April 1988, she staged ``Dream Woman,'' a three-day dance
performance in Taichung, Taiwan's third-largest city. In the last
act of the last night, Hsu stripped and walked through the
applauding audience. City prosecutors took her to court for
``offending public morals.''
   She became an instant celebrity, calling for a social revolution
in Taiwan.
   ``This society thinks nudity is dirty but I think the
politicians are dirtier than me,'' she says. ``I may not wear
clothes but I am better than a man in a suit who steps on the
people.''

<HEAD>Dickinson Bill Would Restore North's Pension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key member of the House Armed Services
Committee is waging a battle in Congress to restore the $23,000
annual Marine Corps pension Oliver North lost when he was convicted
in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Rep. Bill Dickinson, the senior Republican on the committee,
introduced legislation Wednesday to restore the pension.
   The Alabama congressman said that North earned the retirement
pay during his 20-year career in the Marines when he ``demonstrated
his willingness to give his life for his country.'' North retired
before his conviction with the rank of lieutenant colonel.
   ``He certainly shouldn't be asked to give up the security of his
own family over charges that may not have been his doing,''
Dickinson said.
   The bill would exempt North from a law that denies retirement
pay to any government officer convicted of destroying government
documents, one of three felony crimes for which North was convicted.
   The Navy suspended North's pension July 5, when he was fined
$150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of community service
for his convictions on charges of aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress, accepting an illegal gratuity and altering
or destroying classified documents.
   The Navy recommended to U.S. Comptroller General Charles
Browsher that North's retirement pay be restored, but Bowsher
rejected that recommendation Monday.
   The Navy's top lawyers disagreed over whether North should be
considered a government officeholder under the terms of the law
that denies pension benefits to officials convicted of destroying
government documents.
   Because of the conflicting opinions, Dickinson said Congress
should act to ensure that benefits earned by North aren't taken
away unjustly.
   James Hinchman, the General Accounting Office lawyer who
reviewed the Navy recommendation for Bowsher, said it was
``impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is serious doubt
that a retired regular officer'' convicted of destroying documents
can continue to receive retirement pay.
   Hinchman said denying retirement pay to North would clear the
way for the former White House aide to seek a court ruling on
whether the law applies to him.
   Dickinson said there remains ``very real and substantial
questions'' about whether the destruction of documents by North
``was done illegally or done within the score of his authority.''
   In a related move, the Senate on Tuesday added language to the
fiscal 1990 defense bill requiring the Senate Judiciary Committee
to study the North pension issue and report back to the Senate by
November.
   The amendment was a substitute for a proposal by Sen. Steve
Symms, R-Idaho, that would have restored the North's full pension.

<HEAD>Some Senators Urge Caution in Criticism of Israel</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's supporters in the Senate are urging
colleagues to exercise caution in criticizing the Jewish state for
abducting a Moslem cleric linked with Lebanese terrorists.
   But Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas says Israel must
understand that vital U.S. interests, including the lives of
American hostages, may be at stake when it takes such unilateral
actions as the abduction last week of Shiek Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Moslem religious leader.
   The Lebanese captors of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins
announced this week they had hanged him to avenge Obeid's
abduction. Higgins' murder has not been independently confirmed,
and there had been reports that he had been killed months ago.
   Dole said earlier this week that Israel had not told Washington
of its intent to kidnap Obeid and said that such ``free-lancing''
might place Americans at risk.
   ``I don't think my remarks have driven any wedge between the
United States and Israel,'' Dole said Wednesday.
   ``My basic message to Israel is this: `We are in this together.
We both have vital interests at stake. Whenever possible we ought
to act together. And always we ought to take into account the vital
interests of the other when we contemplate unilateral action.'
   ``That is the way to avoid any wedge being driven between us,''
he said.
   But other senators said Israel was justified in its actions and
implied Dole may have caused harm by his remarks.
   ``We ought to be very cautious about our criticism of what
Israel has done,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``Certainly all of us have questions, certainly we want to be
able to have a dialogue with Israel and find out some of the things
that they may have known and may still know and we don't know,''
Nunn said.
   ``If there had been a complete release of the prisoners we would
now be saying this was a marvelous, marvelous action. I think we
should be very cautious in rushing to judgment in terms of what the
Israelis have done.''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Israel's situation, ``surrounded
constantly _ 360 degrees _ by terrorist groups'' _ should be taken
into consideration.
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said Israel's exercise of ``long-arm
jurisdiction'' against an alleged terrorist suspected of violating
Israeli law was justified and is similar to actions against
terrorists taken by the United States.

   Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., is the subject of a
State Department investigation into his conduct on official foreign
trips, a House member says.
   The decision to send investigators to at least two locations was
made after Inspector General Sherman Funk reviewed cables from
several embassies familiar with Savage's travels since 1984, said
the House member, who spoke Wednesday only on the condition of
anonymity.
   The member did not know the investigators' destinations.
   When asked for comment, Savage aide Donovan Dunkley replied, ``I
don't have anything to say about it,'' and hung up the phone.
   Funk also declined to comment on the investigation, saying only
that any information will be given to the House ethics committee.
The committee has been asked to look into allegations that Savage
fondled a Peace Corps worker against her will during a March visit
to Africa.
   Four newspapers _ The Washington Post, Chicago Tribune, Chicago
Sun-Times and Los Angeles Times _ published stories Wednesday about
the Chicago lawmaker's conduct during a 1986 trip to China.
   Savage was in China as part of a delegation from the House
Science and Technology Committee. The Post reported that Savage
revised his schedule after a few days to go to Hong Kong and South
Korea for shopping and sightseeing.
   Before he moved on to Hong Kong, however, Savage locked himself
in a hotel room to protest the U.S. embassy's failure to
immediately get him on a flight, the Post said, quoting anonymous
officials.
   The Times, citing unnamed witnesses, said Savage returned one
night to his official Beijing guest house with two women he had met
in a disco. Chinese security officials sought to prevent them from
entering, and Savage was seen ``raising hell at the guard
station,'' a source told the newspaper.
   The women were driven back to their hotels in an official car,
the Times reported.
   The House Science Committee issued an 80-page report on the
delegation's work, but Savage's name appears only once.
   ``I regretted that he did not stay with the (delegation) for the
remainder of our schedule,'' delegation chief Rep. James Scheuer,
D-N.Y., told the Post. ``We had a very productive trip.''

   A feud between two families erupted in
gunfire before city officials negotiated a truce, hoping to halt a
20-year squabble that had neighbors taking sides.
   Fistfights, threats and arguments between the McDonald and Jones
families have been common since the late 1960s. Last weekend, the
tension exploded into a series of shootings in the inner-city
neighborhood that left both houses pockmarked but no one injured.
   ``We're extremely lucky over the weekend that someone wasn't
killed,'' Sgt. Greg Mills, a police spokesman, said Wednesday.
``The way the violence was escalating, it was just a matter of time
before someone was seriously injured or killed.''
   The families said many of the arguments during the past 20 years
began between children. But no one can remember what specifically
started the feud, shortly after the Joneses moved to the
neighborhood 23 years ago.
   ``One of them would get into it with one of my daughters and she
would curse her and then naturally I'd say something,'' Clarencine
Jones explained. ``It just got bigger. We've had fights and
arguments but never guns.''
   ``It stayed between the kids before,'' Barbara McDonald said as
she stood on the front porch of her home.
   After the gunfire Saturday, police called the city's human
relations department. Director Alvin Brooks met with 22 members of
both families Monday. On Tuesday, Mrs. Jones and Ms. McDonald
signed an agreement aimed at ending the feud.
   It calls for the families to discourage violence, threats or
hostile remarks. It also said the families won't use weapons and
will be responsible for actions of people who visit their homes.
   The agreement requires both families to discourage neighbors
from getting involved in any disputes, as they had in the past.
   Brooks said the feud will end up in court if either family
violates the pact. Mrs. Jones and Ms. McDonald say they will abide
by the agreement.
   ``I think we can end it. I think it's pretty much over right
now,'' Ms. McDonald said Wednesday.
   The weekend gunfire resulted from a children's argument during a
football game more than a week ago. Police reported a shootout
Friday night, and two more episodes the next night. Three people
were arrested, one juvenile and two adults who were charged with
assault.
   Mrs. Jones said she just missed being shot when the shooting
began Friday on Flora Avenue, which is interspersed with vacant,
weed-choked lots. Bullet holes cover the front door of her small
beige home, and she pointed out bullet marks in the dining room,
curtains and windows.
   ``My nephew came and grabbed me from the dining room. I would
have been dead. Everybody just hit the floor,'' she said.
   Across the street, gunfire broke the windows of Ms. McDonald's
neat brown and yellow house and holes dot the exterior.
   The city will stay involved as long as it needs to, Brooks said.
   ``It's something that's been going over 20 years and just
signing the paper one day, it's not going to go away,'' he said.
   Mrs. Jones' daughter, Cheryl, said she would abide by the
agreement.
   ``It's dangerous for all of us, especially with the little kids
around,'' Cheryl Jones said. Five of Mrs. Jones' grandchildren live
with her.
   ``If they keep going around trying to be Al Capone, it won't get
better.''

   Good news for unemployed actors. Why wait
around for fussy fiction writers to make up stuff? You can perform
the news tonight!
   Except for being scooped by ABC News' apparently inadvertent
attempt at an Emmy nomination for best 10-second drama, NBC News
would have been the first network to leap into the questionable
arena of news ``re-creations.'' Why let those sterling bastions of
journalism like ``A Current Affair'' have all the fun?
   At the outset of NBC's new prime-time news program ``Yesterday,
Today and Tomorrow'' Wednesday night, co-anchor Mary Alice Williams
promised that the re-creations would faithfully reproduce the
events they portrayed and be clearly labeled.
   As to the former, it's assumably true. As to the latter, 'fraid
not.
   In a segment about ``DNA fingerprinting,'' co-anchor Chuck
Scarborough indeed announces that the crime in question is to be
re-created, but as the segment drones on, it becomes confusing to
the viewer. Are the pictures of the woman with bruises on her arms
fake, or real? Is the gruesome closeup of ``brain tissue'' in her
abandoned car re-created? If so, why?
   NBC News has gone over the line between news and entertainment,
a line increasingly blurred in recent months by the proliferation
of so-called ``tabloid TV'' shows that rely on often sensational
and melodramatic re-creations to compete for viewers.
   While ``Unsolved Mysteries,'' which preceded ``Yesterday, Today
and Tomorrow'' Wednesday night, states at its outset that it is not
a news program, ``YTT'' declares proudly that it is. Occasionally
the two programs are disturbingly similar.
   News re-creations have become the TV issue of the summer. CBS'
revamped ``West 57th'' is reported to have re-creations in its
plan, but details of the show, which won't premiere until next
month, haven't been revealed.
   The issue arose when ABC News re-created not an event, but an
alleged event, the handoff of a briefcase from an accused spy to a
Soviet agent. Two ABC News staffers were the performers. In an
early feed of ``World News Tonight,'' the picture was not labeled a
``simulation.'' In a later feed, it was. But ABC News President
Roone Arledge later said that the film of the ``actors'' was to be
used as a model for a computer-generated sketch that would have
been a graphic more than a simulation.
   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' is getting a summer run as a
series of three specials. It does not have a regular time period on
NBC's fall schedule.
   ABC is premiering a new prime-time news show this week, too.
``PrimeTime Live,'' with Diane Sawyer and Sam Donaldson, premieres
tonight. It will not include re-creations.
   ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' set out to utilize
re-creations and will no doubt be discussed largely in terms of the
propriety of network news engaging in re-creation of events.
   Lost in all this is the substance of the program. Just as well.
The premiere of ``YTT'' was indifferent. The crime segment, which
was the only one that utilized re-creations, was hokey-looking at
best. Williams' segment on ``whatever happened to the Woodstock
generation'' was vacuous.
   The most compelling segment was Maria Shriver's segment,
examining ``selective termination,'' a difficult decision faced by
parents who resort to fertility drugs to conceive a child, and end
up with multiple fetuses. In some cases, doctors tell them some
must be terminated if any are to survive. The Shriver segment was
no different from a segment on any newsmagazine _ no re-creations,
just a compelling story.
   During the opening of ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,''
Scarborough announces that show hopes to be unique. What is the
point of employing questionable practices for the sake of producing
a program that is mediocre, but ``unique?'' Maybe NBC News should
think about getting back to basics instead.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Battles for Capital Gains Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee is working to force a compromise on a capital-gains tax
to prevent his Democratic-controlled panel from endorsing a major
element of the 1988 Republican Party platform.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., trying to block the cut favored
by President Bush and dissident Democrats, said Wednesday that he
was offering an ``everybody wins'' compromise that stops short of
changing tax rules.
   Rostenkowski has made no effort to hide his disdain for any cut
in capital-gains taxes because 80 percent of the benefits would go
to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   Unless he can force the compromise, he faces the likelihood that
his own committee, where Democrats have a 23-13 majority, will
endorse the Republican plank.
   ``I've worked out pretty much what I view as a possible
compromise where everybody wins,'' Rostenkowski told reporters
after explaining the concept to his committee members.
   His plan would allow investors to avoid taxes on as much as half
the profit from the sale of assets held over the long term. It also
would provide a greater benefit than an adjustment for inflation,
but less than the capital-gains rate cuts recommended by Bush and a
bipartisan majority of Rostenkowski's committee.
   Rostenkowski said he was pleasantly surprised at how receptive
GOP members were. Some Democrats were skeptical about how the
proposal would affect the budget deficit.
   Rostenkowski's proposal is based on the same arguments that Bush
advanced in asking a capital-gains cut _ that it would spur
investment and create jobs. The chairman's plan would benefit most
assets obtained after July 31, 1989, including common stock in U.S.
corporations, timber and commercial buildings.
   Under the plan:
   _Profits from the sale of an asset owned more than one year
after that date but less than five would be adjusted to ensure that
gains caused solely by inflation would not be taxed. For example,
if inflation were 4 percent a year for five years, 20 percent of
the profit would avoid tax.
   _When an asset owned more than five years but less than 10 was
sold, the seller could subtract inflation for the period or, if
more advantageous, could avoid tax on 25 percent of the selling
price.
   _In the case of property owned more than 10 years, the owner
could subtract inflation or 50 percent of the price for which the
asset was sold.
   A major part of the 1986 tax overhaul was to wipe out a
long-term tax break for capital gains. Such income now is taxed at
the same rate as wages and other income.
   Bush's plan, which drew little Democratic support in the Ways
and Means Committee, would cut the maximum tax rate on capital
gains from 33 percent to 15 percent.
   Rep. Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., a member of the committee, proposed an
alternative that, in effect, would cut the top rate to 19.6 percent
for two years, then raise it permanently to 28 percent and add an
inflation adjustment.
   That proposal is supported by all 13 Republicans and six
Democrats on Ways and Means, and Jenkins said Wednesday he has the
votes to win in the House.
   Here's how the various proposals would work, assuming a block of
stock was bought for $1,000 and sold for $10,000 five years and one
day later, with inflation of 4 percent a year:
   _Current law would tax the full gain: $9,000 at a maximum rate
of 33 percent, for a tax of $2,970.
   _Simply ``indexing'' the system so that inflation-caused gain
would escape tax would result in $8,800 gain and $2,904 tax.
   _Rostenkowski's proposal would mean a $7,500 taxable profit and
a $2,475 maximum tax.
   _Jenkins' amendment, which would exclude 30 percent of gain from
taxes, would have a $6,300 taxable gain and a top tax of $2,079.

<HEAD>Police Convention Deeply Divided on Gun Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RON JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some members of the Fraternal Order of
Police endorsed new restrictions on semiautomatic weapons. Others
were sticking by their guns as the organization prepared to vote on
gun control resolutions.
   ``It's a very emotional issue for this group and the delegates
are really polarized,'' Steve Cain, president of the Oklahoma
Fraternal Order of Police, said Wednesday.
   Some delegates _ many from Eastern cities _ expressed support
not only for restrictions but also for waiting periods on gun
purchases. Other delegates, however, backed the National Rifle
Association's blanket opposition to more gun controls. The NRA, a
national gun lobby, has more than 3 million members.
   One of the resolutions _ which could go to a vote today at the
organization's national convention _ would direct the FOP's
national legislative committee to support ``sensible'' legislation
on the sale of semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47, the Uzi and
the AR-15.
   Another calls for lobbying efforts against any attempts to
liberalize laws on machine guns and silencers.
   A third resolution supports the concept of waiting periods on
gun sales.
   Don Cahill, chairman of the legislative panel, said he was
confident about the chances of the resolutions being passed by the
5,000 attending the convention.
   He added that the FOP has been inaccurately portrayed as
``anti-gun ownership.''
   ``That is not the case,'' Cahill said. ``We're sportsmen and
we're marksmen. But some guns have no legitimate use other than to
kill other people, including police officers.
   ``All we want to do is to slow down the proliferation of weapons
obtained by the criminals.''
   Cahill of the Prince William County, Va., police department said
some of the strongest opponents of the resolutions are from
sparsely populated Western states ``where you could shoot off a
cannon and it wouldn't hurt anybody.''
   ``But the majority of our cops are not in those locations. They
are in densely populated areas.''
   Deputy Sheriff C.R. Powell of Tucson, Ariz., said he fears
passage of the resolutions ultimately will lead to police officers
not having access to weapons with the firepower that criminals have.
   He said the Pima County Sheriff's Department is constantly
fighting drug runners from nearby Mexico who are armed with
semiautomatic weapons.
   ``I don't want to be facing the bad guys with just a .45,''
Powell said.
   Charles J. Oshinsky of Charleston, S.C., a retired police and
security officer, said his position is ``no gun control
whatsoever.'' He backs the NRA position that outlawing weapons
infringes on the constitutional right to bear arms.
   The NRA, though present at the convention, is prohibited from
lobbying at its booth in a building across from the State Fair
Arena, site of the convention's main business.
   Jody Thomas of the NRA said the association was notified in
writing to refrain from political activity at the booth. She said
the NRA has been advancing its cause at a hospitality suite near
the convention.
   Inside the hall, numerous FOP members espoused the NRA view.
Among them: Sam Cross, a retired police chief from Indio, Calif.,
who said he found gun controls such as waiting periods ineffective.
   ``We've had waiting periods for at least 20 years in California,
but the crime rate has kept going up,'' he said.
   Still, Cain, a lieutenant with the Norman Police Department,
said something must be done.
   ``I head a narcotics unit,'' said Cain, ``and I'm tired of
seeing our officers outgunned.''

   Hezbollah was formed seven years ago and
became an arm of terror for Iran's fundamentalist Shiite Moslem
revolution.
   Western intelligence agencies say black-scarved fanatics of the
Party of God have cut a trail of terror, kidnapping scores of
foreigners in Lebanon, hijacking airliners and killing hundreds of
Americans, Frenchmen and Israelis in suicide bombings.
   They believe Hezbollah's core of 3,500 fighters includes about
150 kidnappers using cover names including Islamic Jihad,
Organization of the Oppressed on Earth and Revolutionary Justice
Organization.
   ``All these groups overlap and in all likelihood are the same
people,'' said Adam Cherski, a specialist on Iran with the
Institute for the Study of Terrorism in London. ``Despite Tehran's
denials, the Iranian influence with these people is very, very
strong.''
   Hezbollah embraces the cult of martyrdom embedded in Shiite
tradition since the 7th century, when Islam was split over the
succession to the prophet Mohammed, founder of the religion.
   It was formed in 1982 by Shiite militants and Iranian
Revolutionary Guards who were sent to the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
Valley of eastern Lebanon to fight Israel's invasion army.
   The organization's roots are in 1969, when plans for a militant
movement were made in Najaf, Iraq, where Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini lived after the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi sent him
into exile.
   In Najaf, Iranian mullahs laid the foundations of the Islamic
revolution that toppled the shah 10 years later.
   Financed by up to $5 million a month of Iranian money, Hezbollah
tried to create another Islamic republic by building religious,
social, educational, agricultural and medical services for 1
million Shiites in Lebanon, the country's largest sect.
   Government authority had been eroded by a long civil war and
Hezbollah made a virtual state within a state while fighting for
control of the Shiite community with a more moderate rival, the
Syrian-backed Amal militia.
   In recent months, mirroring the power struggle in Tehran, four
factions have arisen in Hezbollah.
   One is allied with Iran's new president, Hashemi Rafsanjani, and
another with hard-line Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi. A
third is linked to Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, once Khomeini's
designated heir, and the small fourth group has aligned itself with
Syria.
   There are indications Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called
pragmatists who see no future in exporting Khomeini's revolution,
is trying to rein in Shiite zealots in Lebanon.
   Shiite sources say Mohtashemi's influence over Hezbollah began
to decline when Rafsanjani emerged after Khomeini's death June 3 as
Iran's most powerful politician. They say Rafsanjani has sent some
of his allies in the Revolutionary Guards to the Bekaa to contain
the militants.
   Militants in Hezbollah have followed Mohtashemi, but its
political leaders in Beirut's southern slums side with Rafsanjani,
who controls their finances.
   When the movement's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammad Hussein
Fadlallah, visited Tehran with other Hezbollah leaders in July to
mark the end of 40 days of mourning for Khomeini, he reported to
Rafsanjani.
   Previously, Fadlallah had reported to Mohtashemi or Hussein
Sheikoleslam, deputy foreign minister and a link for years between
Tehran and Hezbollah.
   Sheikoleslam was involved in the 1979 U.S. Embassy seizure in
Tehran. A former student at the University of California at
Berkeley, he trained with the Palestine Liberation Organization in
southern Lebanon in 1977 and was an interrogator of the U.S.
hostages in Tehran.
   He had close ties to Hezbollah in the early 1980s, when he was
based in Damascus and Mohtashemi was ambassador to Syria.
   U.S. intelligence has linked both men to suicide bombings in
1983 and 1984, including an attack on the U.S. Marine base in
Beirut that killed more than 240 military personnel.
   A central figure in Hezbollah violence is Imad Mughniyeh, 36,
its chief of security.
   Western intelligence agencies list him as leader of Islamic
Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, which holds two U.S. hostages. He is
believed to be the brains behind scores of kidnappings.
   Mughniyeh is wanted by the United States in the 1985 hijacking
of a TWA jetliner in which a U.S. Navy diver was killed and 33
Americans were held hostage 17 days.

   Passengers praised the pilot of a
Piedmont Airlines jet who brought the aircraft down safely after a
rubber wheel block jammed the landing gear _ and they thanked God
they were alive.
   ``I was praying, I had my rosary, I was saying Mass _ I just
knew we weren't going to crash,'' said Marie Fay of McLean, Va.,
who was chain-smoking and perspiring profusely after telephoning
relatives.
   ``God and the pilot were with us,'' she said.
   A Boeing 737-400, with 94 passengers and six crew members aboard
and piloted by a 20-year veteran who wasn't scheduled to make the
flight, came to a skidding halt with a wing and engine scraping the
runway Wednesday after its left landing gear failed to lower. No
one was injured.
   Airline officials declined to identify the pilot of Piedmont
Flight 1489, but he was identified by his family as Larry Fuda, of
Rocky Mount, Va., the Roanoke Times &amp; World-News reported in
today's editions.
   Fuda, 48, declined interviews Wednesday night as he rested at
his home with his family.
   ``He's just glad it worked out,'' said his wife, Margaret. ``The
whole crew did just what they were supposed to do. ... He says he
doesn't consider himself a hero.''
   The plane was bound for Charlotte from Washington National
Airport but was diverted to Greensboro after a light on the jet's
instrument panel showed the landing gear wasn't locked, said USAir
spokesman David Shipley. Piedmont is a subsidiary of USAir Group.
   The Greensboro airport was chosen because it has the longest
runway in the state and Piedmont has a maintenance hangar and a
larger staff with technical expertise there, officials said. The
plane circled the airport for more than a hour as the pilot and
Piedmont officials on the ground collaborated on ways of shaking
the gear loose.
   A flash of flame and smoke flew from the engine as it dragged
the runway. When it came to a stop, fire crews hosed down the left
side of the plane as passengers and crew evacuated by sliding down
two emergency chutes shortly before 11 a.m.
   ``I opened my eyes, saw the plane was in one piece, thanked God
and got the hell off,'' said Michael Maher, 31, of Washington.
   Phillip Powell, an air safety investigator with the National
Transportation Safety Board, said investigators found a chock _ a
triangular rubber block 30 inches long and 6 inches high used to
brace the wheels of parked planes _ wedged between two wheels on
the left landing gear.
   In-flight efforts to shake the wheels loose failed and, after
the landing, the gear remained jammed.
   Powell said officials did not know whether the incident was an
accident or sabotage.
   Chocks normally are removed by the ground crew before the plane
leaves the gate, said Powell and J. Daniel Brock, USAir's vice
president of marketing services. They said they had never before
seen a malfunction from a wheel chock that jammed landing gear.
   Fuda was not originally scheduled to pilot the flight, according
to Donnie Campbell, a retired Piedmont pilot and neighbor of Fuda's.
   ``He just picked this trip up,'' Campbell said. ``He was
supposed to work Friday night, but they're having a `Farewell to
Piedmont' party in Roanoke Friday night, and he wanted to go to
that.''
   The passengers, some of whom broke into tears while others
applauded when the plane came to a halt, saved their highest praise
for the pilot.
   ``I went to the pilot when we got off and I stuck my thumb up
like this,'' said passenger Richard Kochan who demonstrated a
thumbs-up sign. He said the pilot looked at him and pointed to the
sky.
   Many were shaken.
   ``It was like an amusement park,'' said Marlyne Lipferi of
Washington, ``and I don't like amusement parks.''

   A wrongful life lawsuit claiming a child
should never have been conceived can go to trial, the Indiana Court
of Appeals has ruled.
   In a 2-1 decision Wednesday, the court reinstated the claim of
the son of a mentally retarded nursing home resident who was raped
by another patient.
   Previously, California, New Jersey and Washington have
recognized a wrongful life suit in which a child claims that were
it not for the negligence of another, the child would never have
been born.
   Forum Group Inc., owner of Riverview Manor nursing home in
Marion, is the defendant in the Indiana suit.
   According to court records, a mentally retarded resident of the
home, Wayne Anthony Morgan, had intercourse with a retarded
34-year-old woman, unable to speak or control her muscles, more
than once in the summer of 1985.
   Morgan later pleaded guilty but mentally ill to a rape charge.
   The woman gave birth to a son on March 25, 1986. Later, a suit
was filed against the nursing home on behalf of the woman, her
parents and the son.
   The suit, brought on behalf of the boy by his adoptive mother,
claimed negligence allowed the child to be born ``into a world in
which there is no natural parent capable of caring for and
supporting him.''
   Other parts of the suit alleged Forum was negligent in not
protecting the mother from Morgan and in failing to provide
prenatal care until discovering the pregnancy in its fifth month.
   Forum didn't concede Morgan was the father and denied negligence.
   Johnson Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey C. Eggers dismissed all of
the claims except one pressed by the adoptive mother. That is
awaiting trial.
   But the Court of Appeals said the son's claim deserves a trial.
Judge Linda Chezem wrote for the court:
   ``We now recognize a wrongful life cause of action to include a
situation where, as in (the boy's) case, both parents are so
severely mentally or physically impaired as to render them
incapable of affirmatively deciding to have a child or to care for
a child and where but for the custodian's negligent care of both
parents, the child would not have been conceived.''
   The court majority said an Indiana law prohibiting certain
wrongful life actions fails to apply in this case. That law
prevents a claim related to a decision on whether to abort a
pregnancy.
   But, Chezem said, the boy's claim raises a separate issue of
whether, without Forum's negligence, he would have been conceived.
   Although the boy's claim sought financial support until he
reaches age 21, the court said any support he receives as damages
should be only for the period from his birth until his adoption.
   In a concurring opinion, Judge William Conover said he would go
farther by allowing the child to recover damages for mental pain,
suffering and anguish based on a diminished quality of life he
might suffer from being the child of two mentally deficient parents.
   Conover said the child had ``a personal right not to be born''
under such circumstances and thus his conception alone
``constitutes the required trauma and injury, however slight,'' to
recover damages.
   Court of Appeals Chief Judge Wesley W. Ratliff Jr. disagreed
with the majority, arguing that the child's birth in itself should
not be considered an injury for which he can collect damages.
   Ratliff said that although testimony indicated the child had a
10 percent chance of developing a medical problem, there is no
evidence the boy suffers from any defect or disability. Without
that proof, no injury and no liability exist, Ratliff said.

<HEAD>Bloch Meeting in Paris Described by Sources</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC News says the suspected Soviet agent who
met U.S. diplomat Felix S. Bloch in Paris in May picked up Bloch's
travel bag after they dined together.
   In reports from Paris, ABC and NBC News both said Wednesday that
the Soviet agent traveled on a Finnish passport in the name of
Reino Gikman. ABC also cited French intelligence sources in
reporting extensive details about Bloch's alleged meeting with the
agent in Paris.
   A U.S. official familiar with the case, speaking on condition of
anonymity, described the ABC report as excellent coverage but
declined to confirm or deny details in it.
   Bloch, 54, was suspended with pay by the State Department on
June 22. His diplomatic passport has been revoked, but no charges
have been filed.
   He is under constant FBI surveillance and is regularly trailed
by reporters and cameramen. On Wednesday, he visited his Washington
lawyer for the second time this week.
   ABC said the meeting between Gikman and Bloch occurred May 14,
the day Bloch arrived from New York. Both Gikman and Bloch were
watched by French agents from the time of their arrival _ based on
an FBI tip.
   U.S. government sources have said the FBI monitored a telephone
call from the suspected Soviet agent in Paris to Bloch in
Washington requesting the Paris meeting.
   ABC said Bloch left his hotel at carrying a travel bag and
passed Gikman without speaking on the Faubourg St. Honore, a
fashionable shopping street. Soviet officials were observed driving
past the men, ABC said.
   The report said Bloch stopped in front of store windows and
appeared to use them as mirrors to see if anyone was following.
   The two met at the nearby Hotel Merucie and French agents took
still photographs of them as they had drinks and dinner, ABC said.
   Bloch left first, the report said, and Gikman several minutes
later picked up Bloch's travel bag as if it were his own and left.
ABC said French agents videotaped Gikman walking into his hotel
with the bag and again the next morning leaving for the airport,
still carrying the bag.

   President Bush's nominee as ambassador to
Ireland says he wasn't an unindicted co-conspirator in the
Watergate scandal.
   Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked Richard
A. Moore on Wednesday if had been one of the 18 unindicted
co-conspirators while he was an adviser to President Nixon. The
names have never been made public.
   ``No, sir, I was not,'' Moore told committee Chairman Claiborne
Pell, D-R.I.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., who served on the House Judiciary
Committee that voted impeachment charges against Nixon, also asked
Moore whether reports in the mid-1970s were true that he had been
one of the 18.
   ``False, totally,'' Moore replied.
   The committee is expected to approve Moore's nomination today,
with floor approval expected Friday. Nixon appointed Moore's
brother, John, ambassador to Ireland in 1969, a post he held for an
unprecedented six years.
   Meanwhile, the Senate confirmed Shirley Temple Black as U.S.
ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Mrs. Black, the former child actress,
has been ambassador to Ghana and served in a number of positions at
the United Nations.
   Four of Bush's other nominees also won confirmation:
   _William Howard Taft IV, a former deputy secretary of defense,
as U.S. representative to the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   _Joseph Bernard Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real estate
developer who gave nearly $200,000 to Republican Party causes since
1984, as ambassador to Switzerland.
   _Thomas P. Melady as ambassador to the Vatican
   _Keith Lapham Brown as ambassador to Denmark.
   Moore described an April 19, 1973, meeting with Nixon, saying he
told the president how he had urged Dean to come clean and tell
Nixon all he knew about the cover-up. Dean subsequently took his
advice, Moore said.
   According to Nixon's autobiography, Moore was more than just an
adviser.
   ``My friend and White House Special Counsel Dick Moore suggested
that I consider Assistant Attorney General William Rehnquist for
the other vacancy'' on the Supreme Court, Nixon wrote.
   Such was his trust in Moore's advice, that Nixon did name
Rehnquist, now chief justice, to the high court in 1972.

<HEAD>House Would Make Airline Smoking Ban Permanent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The tobacco and cigarette industries and their
opponents are each breathing easier after a House vote that retains
a ban on airline smoking but fails to expand it.
   In a preliminary 259-169 vote, the House decided Wednesday to
make permanent the ban on smoking aboard airline flights of two
hours or less. The restriction, covering four of five U.S. routes,
would otherwise expire next April.
   With that same vote, however, lawmakers refused to consider a
proposal that would have expanded the ban to cover all domestic
U.S. flights.
   The provision was part of the $11.9 billion spending bill for
fiscal 1990, beginning Oct. 1, for federal transportation programs.
A vote on final approval of the overall legislation was planned for
today, which would send it to the Senate.
   Meanwhile, the House adopted a separate bill Wednesday
increasing federal expenditures for AIDS research, prevention and
treatment to $1.6 billion next year _ 25 percent higher than this
year.
   The same measure halts plans for a government survey of American
sexual habits, a study officials had hoped would give them clues
about how sexually transmitted diseases spread.
   Tobacco interests did little to block the smoking ban extension,
reasoning that allowing the ban to become permanent would prevent
anti-smoking forces from seeking to expand it every time the law
expired.
   ``A lot of members simply wanted to be rid of the issue,'' said
Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, the
industry's lobbying arm in Washington.
   ``We recognize the realities of politics,'' said Rep. Walter
Jones, D-N.C., whose district is one of the country's largest
producers of tobacco. ``This is the best compromise we can get.''
   The tobacco industry has argued that opponents' claims of health
problems caused by secondary smoke inhaled by non-smokers are
unproven, and that the ban is bad for business.
   Supporters of the ban, backed by health groups and airline
employee unions, argued that smoking kills hundreds of thousands of
people annually, and that secondary smoke kills 5,000 more.
   ``Tell me a more important health issue,'' said Rep. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of the ban proposals. ``Tell me a more
important life and death issue.''
   Durbin is the author of the law enacted in 1987. At that time,
the House passed a permanent ban on smoking aboard flights of two
hours or less. It was watered down to a two-year prohibition by the
Senate, where senators from tobacco-growing states hold influential
positions.
   The AIDS spending was contained in legislation providing $155.2
billion for fiscal 1990 for labor, health and education
initiatives. The bill was approved 365-58 and sent to the Senate.
   The $11 million survey of American sexual preferences was sought
by the Public Health Service, which has complained that the most
current statistics on the subject are from the 1948 Kinsey Report.
   But conservatives in the Bush administration and in Congress
have said enough is already known about the sexual transmission of
AIDS and that the questionnaire would be an invasion of privacy. A
preliminary survey form asked participants whether their most
recent sexual partner was male or female, and what they thought
about masturbation and oral sex.
   More than 100,000 Americans have been diagnosed as having AIDS,
and more than 58,000 of them have died, according to the Centers
for Disease Control.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Ethiopia Jails, Tortures Political Foes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of suspected political opponents in
Ethiopia have been imprisoned for months or even years without
trial, and many have been tortured repeatedly, Amnesty
International charged today.
   The worldwide human rights organization, based in London, said
Ethiopia has systematically ignored constitutional and legal
safeguards for human rights and is among the worst offenders in
Africa in failing to ratify international human rights covenants.
   In a 13-page report on political imprisonment in the East
African nation, Amnesty said some prisoners have been secretly
condemned to death by a special government committee, or vanish
without explanation while in detention.
   Methods of torture include electric shocks, submersion in water
and beatings on the soles of the feet, the group said.
   Amnesty said Ethiopia has responded to the group's charges with
``either silence or evasion.'' It appealed to President Mengistu
Haile Mariam's Marxist government to free prisoners detained for
their opinions, beliefs or ethnic origins who have not used or
advocated violence.
   Thousands of political prisoners have been detained for months
or even years on the orders of the state security service, the
Central Investigation Organ, without their cases ever being
referred to the courts, the report said.
   Following a failed coup attempt in May, authorities detained 180
people, mostly military personnel, but the government has given no
information of their whereabouts or legal status, it said.
   Amnesty asked the government to either release the prisoners or
formally charge and try them.
   Ethiopia's constitution specifies that anyone arrested should be
produced in court within 48 hours and that no one accused of a
crime should be considered guilty unless convicted by a court, the
report said.
   ``However, in practice, these constitutional safeguards have
been ineffective,'' Amnesty said. ``Arrests have frequently been
carried out without a warrant and no political prisoner is known
have been brought to court and charged within 48 hours.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy and Defense departments will be
allowed to hire ``double dipper'' retirees and give huge salary
increases to critical technical personnel under the Senate's
version of the Defense authorization bill.
   The pay provisions are considered unprecedented.
   Some 525 scientists and engineers, 500 from Defense and 25 from
Energy, could thus get $134,250 per year, more than anybody in the
government except the president.
   The president makes $200,000; the vice president $110,000 and
members of Congress and Cabinet officers get $89,500.
   Current law forbids military officers from getting a pension if
they return to the government payroll, a practice called ``double
dipping.''
   The defense bill for the next fiscal year would permit the
Pentagon to hire 1,000 retired officers, and the Energy Department
250, who could still draw full pensions. The provision tries to
encourage specialists to take critical jobs.
   The Pentagon also would be authorized to set up four pilot
programs under which the department could adjust rank and pay of a
total of 100,000 civilian employees, giving the department a
flexibility that current law forbids.
   Individuals could receive pay increases as long as total payroll
costs did not change.
   Other government departments could operate a total of six such
programs. The Office of Personnel Management would have to approve
the provisions of these programs.
   The House version of the defense bill includes no such
provisions. A conference committee will have to produce an
agreed-upon version of the bill in September.
   Both versions include a 3.6 percent pay raise for Pentagon
employees.

<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. grand jury has indicted a Thai
police general on charges of smuggling heroin into the United
States, an American government official said today.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a federal
grand jury in Brooklyn, N.Y., indicted Assistant Police Inspector
Maj. Gen. Vech Pechborom on four counts July 13. Vech denied the
charges.
   The indictment followed more than four years of investigation by
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in cooperation with Thai
police, the official said.
   U.S. action against Vech is limited, however, because the law in
Thailand forbids the extradition of a Thai national.
   The U.S. official said the DEA charged that Vech was a part of a
Southeast Asian ring that smuggled heroin into the United States at
least 15 times. The drug agency said the operation was based in
Chinatown in New York City and in Los Angeles, and that
Asian-Americans controlled it.
   The official said 22 members of the ring were arrested between
October 1984 and July 1988 in Bangkok, Japan, South Korea, New
Zealand, Hawaii, New York and Los Angeles, and that authorities
seized 77 pounds of heroin.
   Northern Thailand forms part of the ``Golden Triangle,'' the
source of more than 40 percent of the heroin reaching the United
States, the official said.
   He said that according to the indictment, Vech helped arrange
shipments of heroin from Thailand, directed financial investment in
a courier network and used his influence to get drugs through
Bangkok's airport.
   The indictment said Vech directed the shipment of 11 pounds of
heroin that was seized at John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City
in November 1984. Authorities arrested two Thais for possessing the
drug, including a second lieutenant in the Royal Thai Air Force.
   In a telephone interview today, Vech said: ``I deny the charge
and confirm that I am innocent. It has hurt me a lot.''
   Vech said he he did not know Suvit Taechaphana, the alleged
ringleader, who was sentenced in a Los Angeles court last month to
30 years in prison.
   Suvit was arrested in July 1988 and pleaded guilty to charges of
conspiracy to import heroin into the United States.
   A Thai police spokesman said the national police chief, Gen. Pow
Sarasin, on Wednesday appointed a committee headed by a deputy
police chief to investigate the charges against Vech.

<TEXT>
   Workers hunted for more bodies in the rubble of
Kiev's main post office after a portico collapsed on a crowd below,
killing at least 11 people, Soviet news reports said today.
   Dozens of people were standing beneath the huge overhang to
escape heavy rain when the structure collapsed, dropping stone
columns and bricks on them, Lt. Gen. Ivan Gladush, the Ukraine's
interior minister, was quoted as saying in the newspaper Krasnaya
Zvezda.
   Anatoly Gritsenko, a spokesman for the Kiev City Council, said
in a telephone interview the rescuers finished their search early
today after removing the bodies of 11 people and pulling out two
injured. The site was cleared of rubble, he said.
   State television's evening news program, ``Vremya,'' said
Wednesday the portico at the front of the building collapsed at
4:20 p.m.
   ``At this time, there were particularly many people here.
Visitors to the post office, passers-by, and people hurrying to the
nearby metro station were trapped under the rubble,'' the TV report
said. It said the brown stone rubble pile was 16{ feet high.
   The television showed the collapse occurred on the top, or
seventh floor of the building, where two broad columns leading
vertically up the length of the post office and the balconies
between them crashed to the ground.
   The collapse did not affect most of the multi-story building,
which remained standing.
   The building, built in the 1950's, had been under repair.
``Vremya'' said a construction crew had boarded up the post office
entrance with wood, but then had not started repair work, and that
heavy rain apparently loosened part of the facade.
   It said a commission had been formed to determine the cause of
the collapse.
   One resident said a woman had been hit by a falling piece of the
building last winter, but that reconstruction work did not begin
until about a month ago.

   Lawmakers have voted to create a
commission to investigate the deaths of nearly 100 people allegedly
murdered for political reasons since the 1981 martial-law
crackdown, state media said today.
   Despite the communist coalition's 299-161 majority in the Sejm _
the lower house of parliament _ the proposal by Solidarity Deputy
Tadeusz Kowalczyk passed Wednesday on a 174-91 vote with 33
abstentions.
   Earlier Wednesday the Sejm elected Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, head
of the nation's powerful police force since July 1981 and a key
enforcer of martial law, to be the country's new prime minister.
   In a letter to the speaker of the Sejm, Kowalczyk asked the
Interior Ministry to clarify the circumstances of deaths the
lawmaker blamed on security officials, the official news agency PAP
said today.
   He said the ministry was to blame for nearly ``100 political
murders,'' PAP reported.
   Interior Ministry Vice-Minister Zbigniew Pudysz said the
statement was untrue and would cause loss of trust in the police.
   The ministry has admitted to at least one politically motivated
murder, the 1985 killing of a pro-Solidarity priest, the Rev. Jerzy
Popieluszko. Four ministry officials were convicted in the case.
   Solidarity, the free trade union movement, has been monitoring
human rights since martial law was imposed.
   Kowalczyk said a list of cases to be investigated would be
provided by independent human rights groups in Poland, including
the Helsinki Committee and the Polish League for Human Rights
Protection.

<TEXT>
   A 19th century gold prospector may have
been telling the truth, according to a team studying the man's
claims he only killed one of his five prospecting companions.
   Alferd Packer was convicted in 1885 of killing the other five
members of the party and was sentenced to 40 years in prison. But,
although he admitted resorting to cannibalism to stay alive after
the group became stranded in the snow, Packer maintained until his
death that he had killed only one.
   A study of the prospectors' remains support that claim, Walter
Birkby, curator of physical anthropology at the University of
Arizona, said Wednesday.
   The remains were exhumed last month from their resting place in
the Rockies near Lake City, Colo., and are being studied at the
University of Arizona.
   Examinations of and tests on the bones of the five showed signs
that flesh was scraped off with a knife, Birkby said. The four
skulls removed from a common grave also showed signs of hatchet
blows, he said.
   The fifth skull was gone when the bones were buried in August
1874.
   Anthropologists have taken on the challenge to see if they can
determine the real story through scientific detection and see if
Packer was wrongly convicted.
   Packer insisted he shot only one of the men and hit him in the
head with a hatchet in self defense. Packer said the man had killed
the four others with a hatchet.
   Birkby said findings included a bullet hole in the pelvic bone
of one of the skeletons.
   The study team might be able to attach names to bones with
further study of the remains, which include buttons, belt buckles
and some partially decomposed clothing, Birkby said.
   The study team was assembled by James Starrs, a law professor at
George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Starrs has said
that final results of the study will be detailed at the annual
meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in February.

<HEAD>Black Priest Fired by Bishop After Joining Dissident Group</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Richmond, Va. priest fired from his job by
his Roman Catholic bishop for trying to set up a separate
African-American Catholic congregation now seeks to ``challenge
other black priests.''
   The Rev. Bruce Greening announced Wednesday he would join the
Rev. George A. Stallings in setting up a separate African-American
Catholic congregation.
   ``What is happening at Imani Temple is in my opinion the right
method to take,'' Greening said, referring to the congregation set
up by Stallings, himself suspended by Washington Archbishop James
Hickey.
   Greening said he wanted ``to challenge other black priests and
other black sisters'' to follow Stallings' example.
   Greening, 38, was fired by the Catholic Diocese of Richmond, for
which he had worked since 1988 as the principal of an elementary
school in Norfolk. The priest, a member of the Society of the
Divine Savior, in Milwaukee, Wis., had requested a leave of absence
from his Virginia job to set up a separate congregation for blacks.
   He remains a priest.
   ``By the very fact of his free decision, Father Greening
automatically dissociates himself from the Diocese of Richmond,''
said Richmond Bishop Walter F. Sullivan. ``I am relieving him of
his duties as principal of St. Mary's Academy in Norfolk, effective
immediately.''
   Stallings, who has strongly criticized the Catholic Church,
accusing its leaders of not meeting the needs of its black members,
said Greening would assist him as a minister and in forming a
school at the month-old Imani Temple.
   The Rev. Keith Brennan, spokesman for the Society of the Divine
Savior, Salvatorian Order in Wisconsin, said no action had been
taken there by Greening's provincial, the Rev. Paul Portland.
   ``This is the first time that we have had anything like this
happen,'' said Brennan. ```We are trying to find as much
information about what occurred, and what our obligations are
within the law of the church.''
   Brennan said the Wisconsin office would first hold an internal
meeting and would then call Greening back to his home office for an
explanation.
   He said that Greening was the only black priest among 123 at the
Wisconsin religious order.
   In Atlanta, meanwhile, black Catholics are poised to begin today
their annual layman's conference, the first major gathering of
black Catholics since Stallings founded his splinter group.
   The Rev. James Goode, a San Francisco priest who will attend the
Atlanta conference, praised Stallings' movement as ``a beautiful
time of coming together of African-American Catholics across the
country.''
   At the press conference in Washington, Greening said he had been
warned by the Richmond bishop against becoming involved with
Stallings.
   Stallings, who appeared with Greening, said the congregation of
the Imani Temple would be meeting Aug. 19 to discuss the issues
they feel should be at the forefront of the church's agenda.
   ``We're going to look at teen-age pregnancy and the drug
epidemic in our community,'' he said. ``We see these issues as
being systematic of greater issues in our society.'' Other
priorities for the black community are unemployment and education,
Stallings said.
   He also said the Imani Temple has received several requests from
other cities to help them establish other African-American
congregations.
   Stallings said although he has his eye set on certain cities he
felt would respond enthusiastically, he first wanted to set the
groundwork for the ``Mother Church.''

   Disabled Americans could enjoy civil rights
protections with a comprehensive measure approved by the Bush
administration and key senators.
   The Americans with Disabilities Act sailed unanimously through
the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Wednesday and is
expected to be approved by the full Senate.
   ``This historic legislation will end segregation and
discrimination against people with disabilities in all aspects of
American society,'' said a statement released jointly by
co-sponsors of the measure, Sens. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, and David Durenburger, R-Minn.
   The measure was hailed by civil rights groups as well as AIDS
advocacy organizations.
   Ralph G. Neas, director of the leadership conference on civil
rights, a coalition of 180 national organizations, said the bill is
``probably the most comprehensive civil rights measure since the
1964 Civil Rights Act.
   The agreement between President Bush and the senators was ``a
fair compromise that resulted in a strong and effective bill,'' he
said.
   Disability rights groups have been lobbying for years to give
the nation's estimated 37 million disabled Americans, including
people with AIDS, the same civil rights protections as minorities
and women.
   The AIDS Action Council said the measure marked ``a turning
point in the federal response to the challenges'' of the AIDS
epidemic.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush favors allowing
``maximum flexibility to implement effective solutions'' and
bringing the disabled into the mainstream ``without imposing undue
burdens.''
   ``The president believes this can be accomplished by using
reasonable measures, phased over time, as this legislation does,''
he said. ``The president has pursued a common sense approach,
seeking a practical bill that will help the disabled reach their
full potential.''
   The agreement provides for:
   _Federal protection for the disabled against job discrimination,
paralleling existing protections that apply to organizations that
receive federal funds. Initially, the new requirement would apply
to employers of 25 or more, but eventually it would cover employers
with at least 15 workers.
   _A ban on discrimination against the disabled in public
accommodations, including restaurants, stores and health care
facilities.
   _Enforcement of these new civil rights protections through the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ``and suits seeking
injunctive relief.''
   Fitzwater said ``a core group of public accommodations would be
required to make readily achievable alterations to existing
facilities to accommodate the disabled.''
   ``This legislation is designed to achieve access for the
disabled in the most efficient manner, with emphasis on making new
buildings accessible,'' he said.

<BYLINE>Former Dictator Supports Leftist Candidate for President ^By PETER
McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three months of political wrangling over
who will be Bolivia's next president has ended, with former
military dictator Gen. Hugo Banzer Suarez declaring his support for
former leftist Jaime Paz Zamora.
   Paz Zamora, who finished third among 10 candidates in May
elections, and Banzer Suarez, who finished second, agreed to a
coalition government Wednesday.
   Under Bolivian law, if no candidate wins an absolute majority in
the general election, Congress chooses the president. The
Congressional vote is expected this weekend and with Banzer Suarez'
support, Paz Zamora's election is virtually assured.
   The president is to be sworn in Sunday.
   It will be the first time in 25 years that a government has
completed its term and turned over the government to a
democratically elected president.
   ``Our priority now is to consolidate democracy and the economic
and financial stability of the country,'' Paz Zamora said.
   Paz Zamora, a former Marxist who in recent years has described
himself as a Social Democrat, served as vice president in the
1982-85 government of Hernan Siles Suazo.
   He has said his government won't stray too far from the success
of the free market economic program of President Victor Paz
Estenssoro.
   ``I can assure everyone that I will not head a government that
will make traumatic changes in the economic field,'' Paz Zamora of
the Social Democratic Movement of the Revolutionary Left said
Wednesday.
   Paz Zamora, 50, also said his government will respect its
commitments on its $4 billion foreign debt.
   The decision by Banzer Suarez' Conservative Nationalist
Democratic Action Party to support the Social Democrats assures Paz
Zamora the 79 votes among the 157 Senators and Deputies needed to
become Bolivia's 77th president.
   In the May 7 election, Paz Zamora's party came in third with 19
percent of the popular vote. Banzer Suarez garnered 23 percent and
Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada of the ruling Nationalist Revolutionary
Movement, 24 percent.
   Under the accord, Banzer Suarez' party will receive 10 Cabinet
posts, the vice presidency, and presidency of the lower house of
Congress. Paz Zamora's party will receive the presidency,
leadership of the Senate and eight Cabinet posts.
   It is an unusual partnership. Banzer Suarez, 64, jailed and
persecuted Paz Zamora and members of his left-of-center party when
he ruled the country from 1971 to 1978.
   Paz Zamora said that ``Banzer Suarez has given us an example of
love for the country and human qualities in finding the key to
solving a deadlock that appeared without solution.''
   Until Wednesday's announcement, there was concern that a
president would not be elected before Sunday's inauguration. Roman
catholic church officials last week appealed for a break in the
impasse.
   Paz Zamora also promised an all-out war against his country's
cocaine trade.
   Bolivia, an impoverished country of 6.9 million residents,
produces an estimated one third of cocaine for U.S. and European
markets. About 300,000 Bolivians depend on coca leaf cultivation
and cocaine production for their livelihood.
   Bolivia, once considered the most unstable country in South
America, is in its seventh year of democratic rule.
   In 1985, Paz Estenssoro's government implemented tough economic
austerity measures that slashed inflation from 20,000 percent
annually to just 6 percent.
   The measures included a ten-fold increase in the price of
gasoline, an end to all price supports, the firing of 23,000
government employees and the restructing of government-owned
companies.

<HEAD>Navy F-14 Crashes in Pacific, Both Crewmen Eject Safely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy fighter jet crashed into the Pacific
Ocean after developing engine trouble, and both occupants ejected
safely, a Navy spokesman said.
   The pilot and radar-intercept officer of the F-14 Tomcat were
rescued by a Navy helicopter about two miles offshore from Point
Loma.
   Their names were not immediately released. Both suffered only
minor bumps and bruises and were taken to Balboa Naval Hospital in
San Diego for overnight observation, said Navy spokesman Joe Ciokon.
   Navy crews, aided by the U.S. Coast Guard, began trying to
salvage what remained of the $40 million warplane Wednesday night
as Navy officials began an investigation into the cause of the
crash, Ciokon said.
   The twin-engine jet had just taken off from the nuclear-powered
aircraft carrier Carl Vinson on a training mission at about 6 p.m.
Wednesday when it developed engine trouble. The carrier, based at
the Alameda Naval Air Station near Oakland, was on a training
exercise, Ciokon said.
   The pilot was attempting an emergency landing at North Island
Naval Air Station on the Coronado Peninsula when the two fliers
decided to eject, said Cmdr. Doug Schamp, another Navy spokesman.
   It was the second F-14 from the Vinson to crash within two
weeks, and the third Navy jet to crash off San Diego during that
period.
   It also was the 102nd F-14 crash since the fighter, built by
Grumman Aerospace Corp., was introduced as the Navy's front-line
fighter in 1972.

<HEAD>John Hirsch, Canadian Director, Dead at 59</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Hirsch, an award-winning director who staged
plays on Broadway and interpreted Shakespeare at the Stratford
Festival in Canada, died in Toronto. He was 59.
   Hirsch, an immigrant from Hungary who lost a family in a Nazi
concentration camp, died Tuesday night in a Toronto hospital of
cryptococcal meningitis, a complication resulting from AIDS.
   He had been teaching theater at Southern Methodist University in
Dallas when he collapsed in December. He was hospitalized for
several weeks, returned to Toronto and was hospitalized again three
weeks ago.
   ``Canadian theater has suffered an irreplaceable loss,'' said
Gary Thomas, general manager of the Stratford Festival in
Stratford, Ont. ``We are all deeply saddened by the passing of John
Hirsch.''
   ``He was an incredibly talented man,'' said John Kennedy, head
of TV Arts, Music and Science at the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
Kennedy worked with Hirsch when the latter was head of drama at the
network from 1974 to 1978. ``He was compassionate. I celebrate his
life.''
   When Hirsch was hired as Stratford's artistic director in 1981,
he fought for lower ticket prices because he felt the festival was
catering to the elite.
   ``Shakespeare is not high art, you know,'' Hirsch once said.
``It's a great mistake to look at his plays as a kind of rarefied
theatrical expression. If there isn't good marvelous life there,
with all its dirt and vulgarity, you're not doing his plays
properly.''
   Many in the theatre world credited him with sustaining the
festival at a time when its existence was threatened.
   Hirsch was born in Hungary in 1930 into a middle-class Jewish
family. During World War II, his mother and younger brother died in
Auschwitz; his father was shot in Nazi Germany.
   At 16, Hirsch arrived in Winnipeg and eventually studied at the
University of Manitoba. After graduating, he established the
Muddiwater Puppets and a troupe for children.
   Within a few years, Hirsch had co-founded the first professional
theatre in Winnipeg, the Manitoba Theatre Centre, where he served
as artistic director.
   In 1965, he began directing at Stratford and became associate
artistic director four years later.
   From 1974 to 1978, he was head of television drama for the CBC.
   ``He was responsible for some of the most long-lasting
innovations at CBC, including the series known as `For the
Record,''' said Kennedy.
   He aldo guided productions for Ottawa's National Arts Centre,
Toronto Arts Productions, Young Peoples Theatre and the Shaw
Festival.
   He won the Outer Circle Critics' Award for ``Saint Joan'' at the
Lincoln Center in New York, an Obie Award for off-Broadway
production of ``AC-DC'' at the Chelsea Theatre, and the Drama
Critics Award for ``The Dybbuk'' at the Mark Taper Forum in Los
Angeles.
   His work has also been seen at the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in
Minneapolis, the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Habimah Theatre
in Tel Aviv.
   Hirsch, who had been awarded the Order of Canada, taught theatre
at Yale University and was a visiting professor at the University
of California.

   Showers and thunderstorms remaining from Hurricane Chantal posed
a threat of floods to parts of Oklahoma and Texas today, and
thunderstorms brought hurricane-force winds and heavy rains to
North Dakota.
   The remnants of Chantal spread rain from central Oklahoma to
southwest Texas, and a flash flood watch remained in effect for
much of western Oklahoma and a small portion of north-central Texas.
   Thunderstorms developed ahead of a cold front over the
north-central states Wednesday, with the strongest storms in North
Dakota during the evening. In the town of Lakota, winds gusted to
78 mph and 3.5 inches of rain fell.
   A thunderstorm also dropped 1.19 inches of rain at Brule, S.D.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across northwestern Minnesota
and eastern North Dakota early today, and from eastern South Dakota
into eastern Colorado.
   Northeast Florida also was hit by thunderstorms Wednesday. High
winds downed trees at Bithlo and at Christmas.
   A few showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across the
Northeastern states.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms to be
scattered across the Gulf Coast states, the Plains, the upper half
of the Mississippi Valley and Upper Michigan, with storms most
numerous over Iowa, western Missouri, eastern Kansas and Oklahoma.
Showers and thunderstorms also were expected to be scattered over
northern New England and eastern New York state.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s in the northern Rockies and
along the Pacific Coast; over 100 degrees in the Rio Grande Valley
of Texas; from 100 to 110 degrees in the Desert Southwest; and in
the 80s and 90s elsewhere.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50 degrees at Burns,
Ore., to 94 degrees at Phoenix.

<HEAD>Governing Party Expected to Embrace Throw Support Behind Kaifu</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Factions of Japan's scandal-ridden governing party
were meeting today to decide whether to throw their support to a
former Cabinet minister with a reputaton as a reformer.
   Several major Japanese newspapers said the factions' support was
certain to give former Education Minister Toshiki Kaifu enough
votes within the Liberal Democratic Party to become party president
and its candidate for prime minister.
   The party president is assured of being elected prime minister
by Parliament because of the party's large majority in the lower
house.
   Kaifu, a 10-term lower house member, officially announced his
candidacy on Wednesday. If no other candidates appear before
Saturday's deadline, he could be declared party president without a
parliamentary election, currently scheduled for Tuesday, officials
said.
   The vote in Parliament was expected Aug. 10.
   Kaifu, 58, would succeed Prime Minister Sousuke Uno, who
announced last month he would resign after only two months in
office because of the party's heavy losses in July 23 elections for
the upper house of Parliament. Uno also was linked to a sex scandal
in which he was accused of keeping paid mistresses.
   Kaifu normally would be an unlikely candidate for the
premiership because he has a small power base within the party and
belongs to a faction headed by 78-year-old Toshio Komoto. With 29
members, the Komoto faction is one of the smallest groups in the
conservative governing party.
   Kaifu has not held key Cabinet posts nor top party jobs that
normally are considered prerequisites for the nation's highest
office.
   But larger factions in the giant governing party decided not to
field candidates or were unable to find suitable choices untainted
by the Recruit Co. bribery scandal, which toppled Uno's
predecessor, Noboru Takeshita.
   The power groupings were meeting today and considering Kaifu's
candidacy.
   Recruit sold stocks in a subsidiary to about 160 influential
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen at bargain prices before
the shares were offered for public sale in 1986. The price soared
when the stock went on the market and the buyers made huge profits.
   Recruit also made large political donations and loans to
political figures.
   Kaifu acknowledged he had received about $110,000 in political
donations during a five-year period from Recruit Co.
   But he said the donations had been properly reported, and that
he had received no stock shares from the information and publishing
conglomerate.
   Like many members of Parliament, Kaifu and Takeshita both
graduated from Tokyo's Waseda University, and reportedly have
maintained close ties.
   Party officials said the new prime minister would serve only the
remainder of Takeshita's original term, which ends Oct. 31. The
party will then hold a new election.
   Kaifu told reporters Wednesday it was too early to talk in
detail about his policies. ``But political reform is the biggest
issue that has been raised by the people,'' he said.
   Party members have called for political reform to help restore
public trust in the party, eroded by the Recruit scandal, Uno's
alleged involvement with mistresses and a highly unpopular 3
percent sales tax the party instituted.
   Kaifu has a background as a reformer. He is a member of the
reform committee set up by the Liberal Democrats to deal with the
Recruit scandal.
   From 1974 to 1976, he was deputy chief Cabinet secretary under
the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki, who sought to clean up Japan's
money politics when he succeeded scandal-plagued Prime Minister
Kakuei Tanaka.
   Kaifu later served as education minister for two periods
totaling about two years.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. aircraft carrier rescued a
boatload of Vietnamese refugees on the verge of sinking, and two
fishing boats carrying 111 others landed near Subic Bay Naval Base,
authorities said today.
   Lt. Joseph Gradisher, a base spokesman, said the USS Ranger
picked up 39 refugees Wednesday from the South China Sea after a
U.S. aircraft reported the group's boat was about to sink in high
seas.
   The rescued Vietnamese, which included seven children, had been
at sea for 10 days, Gradisher said. They were turned over to
Philippine authorities this morning.
   Meanwhile, two boatloads of refugees arrived in the nearby town
of San Antonio after surviving two storms at sea, officials said.
   The first boat, which carried 79 passengers, arrived Wednesday.
Ho Tan Hung, the 40-year-old boat captain, said they left Vietnam a
week ago.
   The leader of the second group, which numbered 32, said the
engine of their boat conked out after six days at sea and they
paddled until reaching the shores of San Antonio early today.
   Tran Dinh Nam, a former soldier in the South Vietnamese Army,
said his group left Vietnam on July 19 aboard a wooden boat with an
8-horsepower engine. ``I left Vietnam because I am a Catholic, and
I cannot live with the communists,'' he told reporters through an
interpreter.
   The Philippines hosts a ``first asylum'' camp for refugees in
Palawan province and a separate U.S.-funded camp in Bataan that
provides language and skills training to refugees leaving for new
homes in the United States.
   In March, the Philippine government announced it would screen
Vietnamese refugees who arrive in the country and would send back
people who cannot prove persecution at home.

<HEAD>Lucas Failed ``Litmus Test,'' says Thornburgh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is convinced
that William Lucas did not get the civil rights post because he
refused to criticize recent Supreme Court decisions.
   The attorney general said Wednesday he discounted the
significance of criticism by several Democrats on the Senate
Judiciary Committee that Lucas lacked expertise for the job.
   Lucas, 61, a former sheriff and chief executive of Wayne County,
Mich., has never tried a court case. The panel refused Tuesday on a
pair of 7-7 votes to recommend Lucas' nomination or send it to the
Senate floor for further consideration.
   Thornburgh said ``Mr. Lucas supported the views of the president
and the attorney general in this regard'' when he testified that no
legislation was needed at this time to overturn the rulings.
   ``I find it somewhat bizarre to expect an appointee of the
president to begin his career in opposition to the president in an
important area of the law,'' Thornburgh said.

   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos is
finding it difficult to sell the administration's idea of
``parental choice'' to the chairman of the Education and Labor
Committee.
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., made clear Wednesday he was
not impressed by Cavazos' plea for support for proposals
emphasizing parental involvement that he said were needed to
revitalize school systems.
   Although initiatives outlined by Cavazos have been embraced in
principle by the Senate education panel and the House
Appropriations Committee, Hawkins told Cavazos he sees ``some
dangerous trends in the proposals being advocated.''
   For example, he characterized the parental choice approach to
school selection for their children as ``a very dangerous idea that
has not been fully scrutinized.''
   ``The selling of choice reminds me of the medicine man selling
snake oil,'' said Hawkins.
   The veteran committee chairman has been a major force in most of
the federal education legislation passed in recent years.

   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is
being urged to ratify an international anti-drug trafficking treaty.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told the panel Wednesday the
pact will ``provide us with enhanced law enforcement tools and can
lead to substantial advances in our international cooperative
efforts'' to counter the illegal drug market.
   Thornburgh signed the U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic in
Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances on behalf of the United
States last December in Vienna.
   The treaty includes a provision under which ``all the nations
signing the convention have agreed to exchange evidence of criminal
conduct and to extradite accused traffickers so that safe havens
are no longer so readily available,'' he said.
   However, Thornburgh noted in response to questions from Chairman
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I, that the treaty does not obligate countries
to extradite their own nationals wanted on drug-related charges in
other countries.

<HEAD>Czech Playwright Released After 11 Hours of Detention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vaclav Havel, the banned Czechoslovak
playwright, said today police detained him for 11 hours and warned
him upon his release that he may face similar treatment if he
``moves around and speaks with people.''
   Havel said he was detained Wednesday on his way to a lunch with
the West German ambassador at the nation's embassy in Prague. It
was the second day in a row that police picked him up; they
detained Havel for about three hours on Tuesday.
   ``The police told me that if I'm in Prague they don't like me to
move around and speak with people because I may face the same
troubles again, '' Havel said today in a telephone interview from
Prague.
   He said he arrived in Czechoslovakia's capital early this week
from his summer cottage in eastern Bohemia.
   ``They said they are not interested if I have lunch with an
ambassador when I'm in Prague but they don't like me to meet with
(my countrymen),'' Havel said.
   Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent human rights campaigner,
was jailed for eight months earlier this year but released on
parole midway through the sentence after unprecedented protests at
home and abroad.
   Officials say Havel and some other writers have remained under
prohibition because of their refusal to renounce political
activities.
   Czechoslovak human rights activists are campaigning increasingly
for an official revision of the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that
crushed the ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   The Aug. 21 anniversary of the invasion is expected to result in
renewed anti-government protests.
   Politburo member and Prague party boss Miroslav Stepan said
Tuesday that authorities would not tolerate disruptions in August.
   Czechoslovak authorities have harshly condemned a current
petition, known as Several Sentences, that demands more democratic
reforms.
   More than 11,500 people, including Havel, have signed the
petition, say human rights activists in Prague.

<HEAD>Treasury Plans To Borrow $39.5 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department says it plans to
borrow $39.5 billion from the public next week in a series of debt
auctions being held to replenish the government's depleted coffers.
   Treasury officials said Wednesday the auctions are contingent on
passage by Congress this week of a bill to raise the limit on
federal borrowing by $70 billion to a record $2.87 trillion.
   The House approved the measure on Tuesday and it is expected to
win Senate approval before Congress begins a month-long recess on
Saturday.
   The administration has warned lawmakers that failure to boost
the debt ceiling before the August recess would force the
government into an unprecedented default on its bills on Aug. 15.
   Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber told reporters Wednesday
that the debt auctions scheduled for next week are contingent on
final passage of the increase in the debt limit. The national debt
as of Tuesday stood only $25 million below the current ceiling of
$2.8 trillion.
   According to Wednesday's announcement, the auctions for next
week will include:
   _$10 billion in three-year notes in minimum denominations of
$5,000 to be auctioned Tuesday.
   _$9.75 billion in 10-year notes in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned Wednesday.
   _$9.75 billion in 30-year bonds in minimum denominations of
$1,000 to be auctioned Thursday.
   These notes and bonds are sold regularly during the large debt
auctions which are held four times a year.
   In addition, for this series of debt auctions the government
said it would also sell $10 billion in cash management bills that
would mature on April 19, 1990. These bills will be sold in minimum
denominations of $10,000.

   As federal officials in Chicago announced the
indictment of 46 traders on the nation's two largest commodity
exchanges, a House committee wrangled over how best to eliminate
fraud in the marketplace.
   Legislation approved Wednesday by the Agriculture Committee
would grant permanent regulatory authority to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, which Congress has reauthorized on a temporary
basis every three or four years since its creation in 1974.
   It also would impose restrictions on trading practices that have
come under criticism following disclosure of the federal
commodities probe.
   During the daylong session, the committee approved an amendment
making insider trading on the commodity futures markets a felony
punishable by five years in prison and a $500,000 fine.
   The panel also killed, in an 18-17 vote, an earlier amendment
outlawing ``front running,'' whereby a broker trades for his own
account before taking care of customers who want to make the same
trade.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla, chairman of the subcommittee, called
the Chicago indictments ``a dark day for the industry. The types of
wrongdoing alleged in the indictments cast a long shadow of doubt
on how well the public has been protected as it participated in the
futures markets.''
   But, English said, the pending legislation marks ``the dawn of a
new day as well.''
   The session began hours before officials in Chicago announced
indictments stemming from a 2 {-year investigation into alleged
trading fraud on the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The charges ranged from tax fraud to
racketeering.
   U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said traders broke the law as well
as exchange rules by arranging deals with one another before and
after the pits were open for trading.
   Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas, told
the panel that the indictments were the U.S. attorney's
responsibility. ``Our responsibility is to see that there is law on
the books'' to protect the public.
   The committee later Wednesday approved on a voice vote
legislation based on a bill adopted last week by the Conservation,
Credit and Rural Development Subcommittee.
   The bill would go to the Senate if approved by the full House. A
vote by on the House floor has not been scheduled.
   The bill would severely limit the practice of dual trading, in
which floor traders can trade for themselves as well as their
customers on the same day.
   Critics say the practice, which is legal, encourages brokers to
take care of themselves to the detriment of their customers. But in
several days of testimony earlier this summer, supporters _
including officials of the two Chicago exchanges _ claimed dual
trading helps ease market volatility when there are few customer
orders.
   The bill, sponsored by English and Rep. E. Thomas Coleman,
R-Mo., would ban dual trading except in certain circumstances,
including small markets with an average daily trading volume of
7,000 contracts or fewer.
   Contract markets also would be exempt from the dual trading ban
if they could prove that by later this year they would have
adequate surveillance systems and procedures so investigators could
track any given trade to within one minute of its conclusion.
Tracking trades is known in the industry as following the audit
trail.
   No later than three years after the law took effect, markets
would have to be able to track trades to within 30 seconds to win
the exemption.
   Amendments introduced last week by Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C.,
would have made the practice of ``front running'' a felony with a
fine of up to $500,000 upon conviction.
   In a letter to de la Garza on Tuesday, the Justice Department
stated that front running ``is adequately addressed by exisiting
law'' under the mail and wire fraud statutes and the amendments
should be dropped.
   The committee eliminated Tallon's amendments on a narrow vote on
the ground that it might jeopardize the Chicago probe by calling
into question whether front running was illegal.
   CFTC Chief of Staff Robert Mackay told the committee that
``there is no doubt in the commission's view'' that front running
was a crime under existing law. Changing the law now ``could indeed
jeopardize ongoing investigations,'' he added.
   An amendment, to raise the amount of money or collateral _ known
as the margin requirement _ investors must deposit with brokers
when buying or selling futures contracts, was withdrawn after
numerous committee members opposed it.

<HEAD>Taiwanese Businessman Settles Insider Trading Charges for $25 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Taiwanese businessman implicated last year
in a major insider trading case with a junior analyst at a
venerable Wall Street brokerage house has agreed to pay more than
$25 million to settle civil charges.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission announced Wednesday that
Fred C. Lee, 39, a Taiwanese national living in Hong Kong, agreed
to pay $25.1 million in illegal profits and fines to a
court-appointed receiver.
   The SEC sued Lee in New York last year, charging that he engaged
in a $19 million insider trading scheme with Stephen K. Wang, then
a 24-year-old analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.'s mergers
department.
   Wang pleaded guilty Sept. 7 to one count each of securities,
wire and mail fraud for taking about $200,000 to funnel
confidential information to Lee about at least 25 takeover deals
that were being handled by Morgan at the time. There was no
allegation of wrongdoing by Morgan, which suspended and later fired
Wang.
   In a related development, the SEC settled a lawsuit with
Standard Chartered Bank, a British bank that held $12.5 million of
Lee's money at its Hong Kong branch.
   The SEC got a federal judge in New York to order Standard
Chartered to turn over in New York an amount equal to the money Lee
had on deposit in Hong Kong. The bank complied but sued, claiming
it was being put in a kind of financial double jeopardy because Lee
was suing for the release of his $12.5 million in the Hong Kong
courts.
   The case went to the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Manhattan, which had yet to rule.
   With the surrender of Lee's $25 million, $300,000 was turned
over to the bank for expenses incurred in the New York and Hong
Kong lawsuits.
   ``The settlement of the case presents us with the outcome we
were seeking and we are therefore pleased that we were able to
discontinue our appeal,'' Martin Hayman, Standard Chartered Group's
chief legal officer, said in a statement issued in New York.
   The bank has 700 branches in 50 countries.
   According to the SEC, Lee, made $19 million on trades for
himself and about 30 other people by allegedly trading on the
inside information he got from Wang.
   In an interview with SEC attorneys in Hong Kong last year, Lee
admitted using inside information supplied by Wang.
   SEC officials said that until the record $650 million settlement
by the investment banking firm of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
pushed Ivan F. Boesky down the list to No. 2, the Lee-Wang case was
the second-largest insider trading scheme ever prosecuted.
   As part of the settlement, Lee agreed to pay $19 million into a
fund to reimburse investors defrauded by his scheme.
   Lee also will pay $1.5 million in fines and $4.5 million in back
taxes with interest on his illegal trading profits.

<HEAD>China Demands South Korea Return Defectors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>

   China demanded today that South Korea hand over a
Chinese army major who fled to South Korea with his wife and asked
for political asylum.
   The South Korean government has said it is investigating the
case of Maj. Zuo Xiukai and his wife, who walked into the
U.N.-controlled truce village of Panmunjon on Saturday.
   The officer had been stationed in communist North Korea as a
member of the Chinese delegation to the Korean Military Armistice
Commission. China fought on North Korea's side in the 1950-53
Korean War, and is a signatory to the armistice agreement.
   A South Korean newspaper said the pair wants to go to the United
States.
   In its first public comment on the defection, China's Foreign
Ministry said in a statement: ``It was under the influence of some
external factors that the Chinese (People's Liberation Army) man
and his wife entered South Korea. The South Korean side should
immediately and unconditionally turn them over to the Chinese
side.''
   The ministry did not explain what it meant by ``external
factors.'' Several other Chinese defections have been reported
since the June 3-4 crackdown by the military on the pro-democracy
protest movement.
   In Seoul, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency quoted an
unidentified Foreign Ministry official as saying the pair would not
be returned because of Seoul's policy of respecting defectors'
wishes in accordance with international laws and customary
practices.
   The South Korean Foreign Ministry declined to comment.
   When eight singers fled from a Chinese opera company in San
Francisco this week, the Chinese consulate there similarly claimed
they were ``instigated by people with motives to bring damage to
China.'' The eight have not made any applications to the U.S.
government.
   Diplomats at Chinese embassies and consulates in several
countries and some Chinese traveling abroad also have defected.
   South Korea does not have diplomatic ties with China, but has
been trying to improve relations, mainly in pursuit of trade.

   Workers found a decomposed body in a
water tank after residents complained their water smelled and
tasted foul, authorities said.
   Tap water stored in the 100,000-gallon tank posed no danger to
residents, said Steve Edgemon, a manager for the West Virginia
America Water Co.
   ``It was really, really bad,'' said 16-year-old David Woolwine.
``Even when it wasn't looking bad, it smelled.''
   About 45 residents supplied by the tank were told to boil their
water, Edgemon said Wednesday after the body was found. Test
results received Wednesday morning showed no bacteria in the water
to indicate something had died in the tank, he said.
   Officials at the company's main treatment plant added extra
chlorine to supplies and flushed the lines surrounding the tank,
Edgemon said.
   ``I think I'll drink bottled water for a while,'' said resident
Pat Veneri.
   State Medical Examiner Irvin M. Sopher said the remains could be
those of a man who was reported missing since about June 20.
   Police refused to reveal the man's name or details concerning
his disappearance. Authorities also refused to speculate on the
cause of death.
   Water company workers found the access hatch to the 40-foot tank
open and a man's clothing on top, Edgemon said.

   Two boats that participated in a training mission
organized by a sailing club were lost in the Azov Sea and 10 of the
12 people on board drowned, Tass reported today.
   The official news agency said the boats, including yachts,
sloops and motorboats, were part of a nine-vessel mission that
began in Mariupol, an Azov seaport about 620 miles south of Moscow.
   The flotilla set out July 15 and all but two boats arrived at
their destinations, it said.
   The other two, with a total of 12 people on board, were reported
last Friday to have been located at Kosa Dolga, a peninsula. On
Monday, the bodies of 10 sailors washed ashore.
   Two people, a 17-year-old girl and 8-year-old boy identified by
Tass as passengers, survived but were unable to give authorities
details of the accident. They were sleeping and awoke one morning
to find the crew missing because of ``unknown circumstances,'' Tass
said.
   The accident is under investigation, but Tass said carelessness
was involved because the boats did not have any radio contact with
shore or between themselves.

<HEAD>Lack of Progress Hurting Gorbachev's Popularity, Commentator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail Gorbachev may be popular abroad,
but his lack of success at home has eroded his once-strong support,
a writer said.
   A. Migranyan wrote in an 18-page commentary in the July issue of
the literary journal Novy Mir that Gorbachev was much more popular
during his first two years in power. Gorbachev took office in March
1985 and launched his program to make Soviet society more open and
reform the economy.
   Public opinion polls in many foreign countries show Gorbachev
wildly popular. But although Migranyan said the 58-year-old Kremlin
chief has proven himself an adept and appealing politician, the
picture is different at home.
   ``It is not enough to maintain popularity and mass support
constantly if there are no positive results. Leaders need
successes, even small ones, to consolidate their authority,'' he
wrote.
   The writer blamed the problems not so much on Gorbachev, but on
Communist Party functionaries. Gorbachev himself has admitted his
program is faltering, and has lashed out at party officials and
bureaucrats resisting his reforms.
   He has called for an urgent renewal of party and government
ranks from the local to the national level.
   Migranyan did not specify how he believes his programs have
failed but most Soviets know the problems well.
   Soviets continue to be plagued by chronic shortages of housing,
food and consumer goods. Crime, pollution and drunkenness are
reported on the rise, and the government faces a soaring budget
deficit.
   Migranyan said Gorbachev is in a difficult position as he tries
to reform Soviet society from the centralized, corruption-plagued
system of government that has existed for decades.
   ``He wants to destroy the existing structures ... and at the
same time personifies those structures for the public. And
certinaly, lack of successes which are due to the clumsy
functioning of the party and state structures weakens his role as a
leader,'' the commentator said.
   The people, he wrote, are impatient and disappointed in
perestroika and have become demoralized because they are left with
the following picture: ``The past is shameful, the present is
horrendous and the future is unpredictable.''
   He called for Gorbachev and the rest of the leadership to take
more radical steps to ``prevent the further dmiminishing of
Gorbachev's authority.''
   If that effort fails, Migranyan warned, ``Power might be taken
by those forces who would motivate the forceful termination of the
modernization process by the wish to restore law and order in the
society and put a stop to chaos in the country.''

   In passing the $295 billion military
authorization bill, the Democratic-controlled Senate sets the stage
for a clash with the House over key elements of President Bush's
strategic weapons programs.
   The Senate, which approved the bill 95-4 Wednesday, left
relatively intact the dollars and the structure of the strategic
weapons programs. The House last week made deep cuts denounced by
the White House as irresponsible both in terms of national security
and arms control.
   ``In my judgment, this will be the most difficult conference in
a decade,'' said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican
on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``But I'm confident that we
can emerge with a bill which will meet the president's basic policy
goals.''
   ``It's going to be very difficult,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
the committee chairman. ``There are more profound differences with
the House than we have had for a long, long time.''
   Nunn was asked how he will enter the conference that opens Sept.
8. ``Well armed,'' he replied.
   How does he expect to emerge? ``Alive,'' Nunn said.
   About the cuts made by the House, Nunn said: ``We will be very
interested in hearing their logic. It doesn't leap out at you.''
   The Senate bill, which conforms closely to Bush's
recommendations, calls for a modest cut of $400 million in the $4.9
billion request for the Star Wars antimissile shield.
   It endorses the B-2 stealth bomber if it meets flight test and
radar-evasion standards. It takes only a token $300 million bite
from the administration's $4.7 billion request for the bat-winged
aircraft.
   The Senate also backed the $1.1 billion request to make the MX
missile a mobile rather than a stationary target by placing the
weapons on railway cars.
   And it left intact the $100 million earmarked for the
single-warhead Midgetman missile.
   The House took a sharply different course.
   Members strictly limited production of the B-2 bomber, pressing
the Pentagon to produce a program far cheaper than the $70 billion
price tag for 132 planes now envisioned.
   They slashed the Star Wars request by $1.8 billion and deleted
$502 million intended to help make the MX a mobile missile. And
they removed all of the $100 million for the Midgetman.
   As the Senate completed work on the bill, Sen. Mark Hatfield,
R-Ore., decried the ever-mounting spending for the military.
   ``This Congress _ a bipartisan majority of this Congress _ has
approved $2.2 trillion of the $2.3 trillion requested for defense
spending during this decade alone,'' Hatfield said.
   ``We seem to have lost sight of the fact that every dollar we
spend on bombs and bullets means that we are underfunding programs
to meet the nation's desperate human needs: health care, education,
war on drugs, low income housing, AIDS research.
   ``Our motto ought to be `In Bombs We Trust,''' Hatfield said.
   In other action Wednesday, the Senate:
   _Brushed aside a final attempt to change the administration's
strategic blueprint, sidetracking a proposal to restrict the
Pentagon's ability to conduct anti-satellite tests.
   _Urged Bush to continue development of the Marine Corps' V-22
Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft the administration sought to
cancel. The Osprey takes off like a helicopter but can fly like a
plane.
   _Approved an amendment requiring graduates of the nation's
military academies to give six years of service after graduation
rather than the eight required by the bill. The reason: The longer
term might discourage academy applications.
   _Told the CIA and Defense Department to report by Sept. 1 on how
best to locate and rescue American hostages in Lebanon.
   Voting against the bill were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa; Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Hatfield. Sen.
Donald Riegle, D-Mich., did not vote.

<HEAD>Defense Ministry Says Obeid Heard Higgins Was Alive Last Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Defense Ministry today quoted a Shiite
Moslem clergyman as saying that U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins may have been alive last week, contrary to reports he was
killed months ago.
   An Israeli official said the clergyman, Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid,
may be given lie detector tests to help establish when Higgins died.
   A pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem group, the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth, claimed it hanged Higgins on Monday in
retaliation for Israel's refusal to free Obeid, who was kidnapped
by Israeli commandos July 28.
   Higgins was abducted Feb. 17, 1988, in south Lebanon.
   Despite Obeid's statements about Higgins, Israel officially says
it received word months ago that Higgins had been killed.
   An Israeli official said that during the interrogation, Obeid
gave the impression that he was ``afraid'' to be extradited to the
United States.
   Obeid has been isolated since his capture and has no knowledge
of reports Higgins has been hanged to avenge his abduction.
   Some Israeli officials claim Obeid was a ``central figure'' in
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, an umbrella for factions holding
foreign hostages that also is believed to have provided support for
attacks and car bombings. But other sources in Israel and Lebanon
minimize his importance, describing him more as a religious leader
or a ``cheerleader.''
   A statement released today by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin's
spokesman, Eitan Haber, said ``in his interrogation, Sheik Obeid
stated that while he personally has no information concerning Col.
Higgins' condition, he heard through hearsay that Col. Higgins is
alive.''
   It said Obeid told Israeli interrogators Higgins arrived in
Beirut shortly after he was kidnapped last year and was in good
condition. ``I am in no position to know what happened to him or
might have happened to him afterward,'' it quoted Obeid as saying.
   The statement quoted Defense Ministry sources as saying they
wanted to ``emphasize and reiterate that in accordance with the
information presently available to them, Col. Higgins was put to
death in Beirut already at the end of 1988 but that the ministry
has no definite confirmation of this.''
   Avi Pazner, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said
Israel believes Higgins died as a result of ``mistreatment and
torture'' and that there is ``strong evidence'' he died more than a
year ago.
   An Israeli official, asking not to be identified, said Obeid may
undergo a polygraph test to determine exactly what he knows. The
official said Israel believes Obeid is not telling all he knows
about the Marine's fate.
   Higgins, 44, of Lexington, Ky., was part of a U.N. observer
force in Lebanon when he was abducted. His captors accused him of
spying.
   After the July 1988 shooting down of an Iranian jetliner by a
U.S. warship in the Persian Gulf, the kidnappers announced that
Higgins had been sentenced to death.
   Israel said it captured Obeid in an effort to use the cleric to
free three missing Israel soldiers in Lebanon. It has offered to
exchange him and other Shiite captives for three captured Israeli
soldiers in Lebanon and the foreign hostages in Lebanon. Hezbollah
rejected a swap.

   Israeli officials claim a Shiite Moslem
clergyman kidnapped by Israeli commandos was a ``central figure''
in the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, providing guns and money for
attacks and involved in car bombings and kidnaps.
   But other sources in Israel and Lebanon minimize the importance
of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, describing him more as a religious
leader or a ``cheerleader.''
   ``If I were to name the 50 Hezbollah leaders who make decisions
in south Lebanon, he (Obeid) would not be on the list,'' said a
security source in Lebanon, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Since Obeid's kidnapping Friday, Israeli officials and the media
blamed the 33-year-old sheik for crimes dating to 1983, including
the kidnapping of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, whose
death was announced Monday.
   Obeid has been described by Israeli officials as a ``big fish''
and a ``valuable property'' for the possible swap of Israel's
Shiite captives for Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held in
Lebanon.
   The Defense Ministry today said Obeid told interrogators that
Higgins may have been alive last week.
   Despite Obeid's statements about Higgins, however, Israel
officially has said it received word months ago that Higgins had
been killed.
   Obeid has been isolated since his capture and was unaware of the
reports Higgins has been killed to avenge his abduction, the
Defense Ministry statement said.
   No body has been found and there is no way of knowing when the
videotape showing Higgins dangling from a gallows had been made.
   An Israeli official also said that during the interrogation,
Obeid gave the impression that he was ``afraid'' to be extradited
to the United States.
   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday blaming
Hezbollah for killing more than 250 Americans in the 1983 bombings
of a U.S. Marines barracks and U.S. Embassy buildings in Lebanon,
more than 70 Frenchmen and dozens of Israelis, and then said ``it
is in this context'' that Israel seized Obeid.
   In a speech before Parliament on Wednesday, Rabin said Obeid was
Hezbollah's leader in southern Lebanon and had been ``a central
figure ... in everything linked to attacks on Israel and incitement
of these.''
   Obeid was involved in ``terrorist activities, distributing
money, transferring weapons, participating in and hiding means of
attacks and above all approving nearly every act Hezbollah carried
out in south Lebanon,'' Rabin said.
   He said Obeid admitted under interrogation that ``the planners''
of the capture of two soldiers from Israel's self-declared security
zone in southern Lebanon left from Obeid's house to carry out their
attack in February 1986.
   In the Higgins case, the three abductors were in Obeid's house
the night before seizing the victim near Tyre, Lebanon, in Feburary
1988 and one of them returned there later, Rabin said.
   He also said the car used in Higgins' kidnapping in February
1988 was later kept hidden in Obeid's garage.
   Israel has ``the basis to assume'' Obeid was involved in a car
bombing north of Israel's border that killed 12 Israeli soldiers in
March 1985, Rabin said.
   While no one is claiming Obeid is merely a clergyman, sources
and some Israeli journalists draw a different picture of him.
   One source in Lebanon said that Abbas Musawi, not Obeid, was the
leader of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Musawi was also listed as
the radical group's southern Lebanese head in the English-language
Jerusalem Post.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Obeid drew
his reputation from Raged Harb, his predecessor as Shiite spiritual
leader in the village of Jibchit. Harb, a fiery, anti-Israeli
preacher, was assassinated in 1984.
   While noting that Israel spoke of Obeid approving terrorist
acts, the source added that in southern Lebanon ``approving is
nothing. ... What matters is who plans it and does it.''
   An Israeli source, who also insisted on anonymity, said the
death threats against hostages that followed Obeid's kidnapping
came only because of Shiite anger at an insult to the Moslem clergy.
   He said what little importance Obeid had was diminished when the
Shiite militia Amal took control of southern Lebanon from Hezbollah
in bloody fighting after Higgins' kidnap.
   Israeli journalist Uzi Mahaneimi, writing in the daily Yediot
Ahronot, made the same point and quoted Lebanese sources as saying:
``Israel will not receive anything for Obeid.''
   Mahaneimi wrote that Obeid had been a military commander but was
only a religious leader after the Amal victory. Another source said
Obeid's main source of power was control of a ``martyr's fund'' for
families of slain militiamen.
   The Israeli source said Obeid's lack of power was evident in
that Israel was able to abduct him easily _ by blowing open his
door and killing a bodyguard or neighbor awakened by the blast.
   ``If the guy was that important, he would have had some jeeps
outside and some guys on the roof,'' the source said.

   The Fatah movement of the PLO opened its
first general congress in nine years today with Chairman Yasser
Arafat saying the goal of a Palestinian state may be realized soon.
   ``Fatah is entrusted with a historical responsibility that
becomes more important as we approach the objective,'' Arafat told
the congress, the fifth since Fatah was founded in Kuwait in 1959.
   Independence is ``a stone's throw away,'' he said, referring to
the stone-throwing Palestinians who have been conducting an
uprising in Israeli-occupied territories for 19 months.
   Arafat said he would favor elections in the territories if they
were a step toward creating an independent Palestinian state.
Israelis officials have said they will not allow a Palestinian
state in the territories.
   Tunisian President Zine Abidine Ben Ali opened the congress
saying ``breaches have appeared in the Israeli consensus concerning
the idea of the creation of an independent Palestinian state.''
   ``The just Palestinian cause has won new victories even inside
Israel, where the voices of some important forces have been raised
to call for negotiations with the PLO,'' Ben Ali said.
   Tunisian authorities took special security precautions to
protect delegates. Helicopters and F-5 fighter planes of the
Tunisian air force flew overhead today as they gathered at Congress
Hall in Tunis. The date and precise location of the meeting were
not made public until the day before it began.
   In October 1985, Israeli jets bombed the PLO general
headquarters in a Tunis suburb.
   Five Fatah central committee members have been assassinated or
expelled since the last Fatah congress in 1980 and are to be
replaced. The most prominent candidate was Intissar Wazir, widow of
Khalil Wazir.
   Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, was assassinated by Israeli
commandos in Tunis two years ago.
   Another leading candidate was Hakam Balawi, the PLO
representative to Tunisia who has been the main Palestinian
official in regular talks with U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau.
   Other major contenders included Sfar Habbash, or Abu Nizar _
known as the ``poet of the Palestinian revolution'' _ and two
Palestinian officers, Gen. Mohamed Jihad and Col. Nasser Youssef.
   The congress also will elect new members to the Fatah
Revolutionary Council, a 100-member body which meets regularly
under the Central Committee.
   The congress is due to consider a report from the central
committee on the uprising in Israel and propose ways to increase
Palestinian pressure on Israeli occupation forces.
   Arafat is president of the Central Committee. Despite some
hard-liners objecting to his policies, his position is not likely
to be affected.

<HEAD>Man Jailed in Bank Robberies says `Joker' Disguise was Mistake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bank robbery suspect says he started out
trying to disguise himself as a woman, but the more makeup he put
on, the more he looked like the Joker in the film ``Batman.''
   Richard Hensarling Jr., 25, of Deltona was arrested in the
robberies of four central Florida banks.
   In a telephone interview from the Volusia County Jail, he
described for an interview published Thursday in the Orlando
Sentinel how he came to look something like the movie crook.
   ``Once I looked at myself in the mirror after I had the white
stuff on, I said, `Wow, you look like the Joker,' so I painted the
lips up a little.''
   He stuffed his cheeks with toilet paper to enhance the Joker
effect.
   Hensarling, slight at 5-foot-7 and 135 pounds, said he started
out trying to disguise himself as a woman. He wore a bra stuffed
with toilet paper during one holdup, he said, but now regrets that.
   ``When you're in jail with a bunch of men and they read a story
that you're dressed up like a woman, well, all I can say is it's
not too much fun,'' he said. ``I don't think I could last long in
state prison.''
   Hensarling, who was once convicted of forgery, was charged in
Orlando Wednesday with three counts of bank robbery, said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Bruce Hinshelwood. He faces up to 60 years in prison
if convicted.
   Hensarling said he wants people to know he never used a weapon
in the robberies. He simply gave tellers notes advising them not to
panic and to hand over cash.
   And the Joker wasn't his only costume.
   A teller at the Lake Helen branch of the Florida National Bank,
robbed July 6, told police the bandit looked like ``a made-up dance
hall girl'' but with a fake mustache.
   Hensarling said he wore dark makeup for that holdup, trying to
look Mexican.
   Hensarling said he was terrified he would be killed during the
robberies, but felt he had no choice because drug dealers were
threatening his family because a relative owed them money.
   Police haven't verified that story, but they haven't discounted
it either.
   A dye that marked cash from Monday's robbery of a Freedom
Savings branch in southwest Orange County led police to Hensarling,
said Lake Helen police chief Tom Ling.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree To Inspections Before Global Chemical Weapons Ban</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with Soviet confirmation, details.

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has accepted a U.S. demand that
both countries inspect each other's chemical weapons stockpiles
before a global ban on the weapons is agreed to, a Soviet official
said today.
   Moscow's shift was conveyed in a paper presented to U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III by Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze when they met last week in Paris, the
official said.
   The Soviets agreed with the U.S. position that joint inspections
begin before the ban is initialed by the 40-nation Geneva
Conference on Disarmament, said the official, a Soviet delegate to
the conference who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Moscow previously wanted to allow checks only after the ban was
signed, and the shift was aimed at clearing the way for earliest
possible inspections, he said. ``It is just a matter of time.
Initialing comes before signing,'' the official said, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The accord must be initialed by negotiators before its formal
signing by each country's head of state.
   The disarmament conference has been debating a comprehensive
chemical weapons ban for more than two decades, but delegates have
little hope of getting the draft accord ready for initialing in the
immediate future.
   Disagreements at the conference include how to monitor
compliance with a future ban.
   The Soviet shift in Paris was part of separate superpower talks
since 1986 on chemical weapons. The United States and Soviet Union,
who have the world's biggest poison gas arsenals, say their talks
may help the 40-nation negotiations.
   Both superpowers reported they agreed to on-the-spot inspection
procedures in the latest round of bilateral talks, which ended in
Geneva in late June. But they said an accord on exchanging chemical
weapons data _ which would precede the inspections _ was not ready
yet. The talks are due to continue in the fall.
   The Soviet official said he could not give firm predictions
about when data exchanges or inspections may begin.
   Moscow expects on-site inspections to back its official position
that it has no more than 50,000 tons of chemical armaments. Some
Western analysts have said the Soviet stockpile is more than six
times bigger.

   A stark new portrait of Queen Mother Elizabeth
that was unveiled today may cause controversy, officials at the
National Gallery say.
   The painting, by 23-year-old Alison Watt of Glasgow, shows
Britain's most famous great-grandmother without her customary hat,
wearing a simple dress and staring almost grimly out of the canvas.
   ``I think it will shock people for about 10 to 15 seconds, then
they will get used to it, and in six months' time it will be one of
the most popular portraits of her,'' said Robin Gibson, the
gallery's curator of 20th century portraits. ``It is taking the lid
off the chocolate box.''
   The Queen Mother, who marks her 89th birthday Friday, is the
widow of King George VI and the mother of Queen Elizabeth II.
   Ms. Watt admitted that the portrait didn't look particularly
royal but that was her intention. ``She always appears fluffy,
light, wearing flowing clothes and I wanted to make her more solid.
She has a lot of character,'' Ms. Watt said. ``I didn't want her to
come across as a wee waif.''
   The Queen Mother, Ms. Watt asserted, was happy with the
portrait, but that could not be confirmed.
   ``I do not know what the Queen Mother thinks of it,'' said a
spokesman at her residence, Clarence House, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``Presumably she has seen it because she sat for it,
but we do not issue statements on silly little things like this.''

<HEAD>Grenade Attack on Israeli Patrol Injures Three Soldiers, Three Civilians</HEAD>

   A hand grenade thrown at a passing Israeli
patrol today injured three Israeli soldiers and three Palestinian
civilians in the occupied Gaza Strip, the army and Arab reports
said.
   Troops opened fire after the blast, wounding more than a dozen
Palestinians on the main street in Khan Yunis town, hospital
officials said.
   In another development, the Supreme Court ruled today that the
army's firing orders for plastic bullets are legal.
   Use of the bullets, introduced in August as a less-lethal
alternative to lead bullets, was challenged by Israeli attorney
Felicia Langer.
   In the grenade attack, the army said the soldiers were
hospitalized with slight injuries.
   A curfew ordering people off the streets was imposed on the town
of more than 30,000 people, the army said.
   Doctors at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis said 16 Palestinians
were admitted with wounds, but they were unsure if the grenade
victims were among them.
   Those injured included a 2-year-old boy, a 75-year-old man and
60-year-old woman, the doctors said.
   Also today, John Kelly, visiting assistant secretary of state
for Middle East Affairs, met with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   ``I am not going to be able to get into details of what we
discussed, but I did want to say it was a very useful discussion,''
Kelly told reporters after the hour-long meeting.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, said Kelly met privately with
Shamir for 10 minutes and then was joined by aides to discuss
Israel's peace initiative.
   Shamir has called for elections in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip to help end the Palestinian revolt by selecting
Palestinians to open talks with Israel on an interim autonomy
agreement. The plan also calls for Arab countries to make peace
with Israel.
   ``Mr. Shamir said that for him it was particularly important
that the United States should take up with the Arabs the question
of a change in their relationship with Israel, either make peace or
sign non-belligerency treaties,'' Pazner said.
   He also said Shamir complained about the U.S. dialogue with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, saying it is interfering with
Israel's efforts to get talks going with Palestinians from the
occupied lands.
   The Supreme Court judges said they cannot rule on the legality
of a particular weapon or ammunition, only on its use.
   ``There is no evidence of illegal orders being given,'' the
court concluded in response to a suit urging it to block use of the
plastic ammunition or put strict limits on when it can be fired.
   ``It is lethal, and the regulations should be the same'' as for
lead bullets, Ms. Langer had argued.
   Army rules call for lead ammunition to be used only when a
soldier's life is in danger. Plastic ammunition can be fired to
break up demonstrations. The army says it is not lethal if fired
from 230 feet or more.
   Human rights group say at least 100 of 527 Palestinians shot to
death in the 19-month-old uprising died from plastic bullets.
Thirty-eight Israeli civilians also have died in the violence.

<HEAD>Cambodian Premier Wants Elections 90 Days After Vietnamese Withdraw</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Hun Sen of Cambodia said he hopes free
elections can be held by the end of the year following Vietnam's
military withdrawal.
   Hun Sen also met Wednesday with his main rival, resistance
leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who likened the meeting to one
between ``a father and son'' and expressed sympathy for Hun Sen.
   The two are in Paris for peace negotiations, which have reached
an impasse.
   Vietnam invaded neighboring Cambodia in December 1978 and has
said its military withdrawal will be completed by Sept. 27. Hun
Sen, the head of Cambodia's Hanoi-sponsored government, said he
wants elections held within three months of the pullout.
   ``I do not wish to prolong things, because if you wait too long
... there is more possibility for violations, instability,'' he
said at his hotel. ``This will be the object of discussion with the
other parties, but three months is our position.''
   The United States and 18 other nations at the talks agreed
earlier this week to send the investigation team to help prepare
for a permanent peace settlement in war-ravaged Cambodia.
   But negotiations between Hun Sen and leaders of the three-party
Cambodian resistance alliance led by Sihanouk reached an impasse
after two days of negotiations. Sihanouk ruled Cambodia until he
was overthrown in March 1970, during the Indochina war.
   Hun Sen blames the breakdown in negotiations on the communist
Khmer Rouge, the most powerful resistance faction, which he said
refuses to resume the talks. The Khmer Rouge's role in a future
government in Cambodia has been a main sticking point at the
conference.
   Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge governed Cambodia from the war's end
in April 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion. An estimated 1 million
people were killed or died of starvation under the brutal regime.
   After Hun Sen and Sihanouk met Wednesday night, the prince
expressed an ``affinity, a mutual sympathy'' for his rival. He
described Hun Sen's government and the Khmer Rouge as the key
rivals in Cambodia and himself as ``a sandwich between the hammer
and anvil.''
   A conference of 19 nations continues its work on a peace
settlement despite the disagreements among the four Cambodian
factions.
   In a three-day meeting that ended Tuesday, foreign ministers set
up committees to come up with a plan for monitoring the withdrawal
and an ensuing cease-fire, to deal with sovereignty questions and
to plan for repatriation of refugees. A committee of the Cambodian
factions also was created.
   All committees are to present their proposals to the foreign
ministers at another meeting in Paris on Aug. 28. A U.N.
fact-finding mission will aid the monitoring committee.
   The United Nations recognizes the resistance coalition as
Cambodia's legitimate representative.

   The National Transportation Safety Board voted
today to oppose the public broadcast of airline cockpit voice
recordings after crashes and indicated it would support legislation
to keep the tapes secret.
   The board said it was in the interest of safety to keep the
tapes confidential and not made available for what one member
called ``the lurid entertainment of the public.''
   The five-member board voted unanimously to support the position
of the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Line Pilots
Association in deploring the court-ordered release of a recording
from a Delta Air Lines plane that crashed in Dallas a year ago.
   The tape, whose release was sought by radio and television
stations, captured the voices of crew members joking about politics
and airliner accidents and also screaming just before the crash.
   Both FAA and ALPA said they would seek legislation keeping the
automatically recorded tapes secret, except for transcripts of
material relevant to safety investigations. The safety board
indicated it concurred.
   The NTSB, which is still investigating the Dallas crash that
killed 14 of the more than 100 people aboard the flight, said in a
resolution: ``We believe that transportation safety is better
served by maintaining strict confidentiality of the actual audio
recording.''
   Board member John Lauber said the recording are designed to be
used only in safety investigations, and ``certainly not for the
lurid entertainment of the public.''
   NTSB member Jim Burnett said cockpit tapes are ``painful things
to listen to, and why anyone would entertain the idea of making
either entertainment or drama out of them, I don't know.''
   The NTSB rejected a proposal to strongly condemn the disabling
of voice recorders by air crews. Lauber said members opposed such
action, which is illegal, but wanted to focus on the importance of
the recorders in safety investigations.
   The pilots union withdrew Wednesday a threat to order its 41,000
members to disable the recorders. Union president Henry A. Duffy
said he was confident that Congress would correct the problem.
   ``No other workers in America are subjected to routine, constant
tape recording of the performance of their duties, so the mere
existence of the cockpit voice recorder is an invasion of
privacy,'' Duffy said.
   He said pilots have agreed to have the recorders installed on
the condition that they be used only for the purposes of safety
investigations and that they never be released for public broadcast.
   ``No pilot wants to hear broadcast to the public the agonized
screams of his colleagues the moment before they die in a fiery
crash,'' Duffy told a news conference. The crew of the Delta flight
all survived.
   Duffy said the Delta tape's release was insensitive and a
violation of pilots' agreements with federal investigators. He said
the public's right to know was not at issue since federal
investigators release all relevant information from crash tapes.
   The tape of Delta Flight 1141's last 30 minutes includes
conversation and joking on the taxiway about news coverage of other
crashes, Jesse Jackson's politics and Marilyn Quayle's looks.
   The crew also joked that a plane wreck would one day expose
their gleeful cockpit conversation to the public. The conversation
involved the cabin crew and a flight attendant.
   The tape ends with a scream and the sound of the plane breaking
apart.
   Duffy said scores of pilots called or sent messages to urge
action. He said many indicated they were ``ready and willing'' to
disconnect the recorders, although he acknowledged such an act
``probably would have been illegal.''
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said pilots who disable the loop-tape
devices could be subject to a $1,000 fine and suspension of their
pilot's certification. Farrar said he could recall no incident
where a pilot had taken such action.
   Farrar said that immediately after word that Texas District
Judge Adolph Canales had ordered the Delta tapes released, the
agency began considering ways to prevent such action in the future.
   ``We are very disappointed. We agree with the pilots right down
the line. This is an unwarranted invasion of privacy,'' Farrar
said. He said it was the first time in his memory that an actual
cockpit audio recording had been aired publicly.
   Previous recordings of sounds and voice aboard airliners prior
to crashes came from communications between pilots and air traffic
control centers. Those tapes are regularly released after
accidents, but the cockpit voice recorders pickup all conversation
in the cockpit, including casual comments.
   Duffy also scored news media that aired the recordings, saying,
``the press sometimes lets sensationalism win out over responsible
reporting.''
   Delta last week accepted blame for the Dallas crash, saying the
crew neglected to properly position wing flaps for takeoff. The
pilot, copilot and flight engineer were all fired, the airline said.
   The pilots union protested the actions, saying the airline
should have waited for results of the safety board investigation.

   A man sitting on a grand jury hearing testimony
from undercover narcotics officers was arrested after an officer
identified him as a dealer who once sold him heroin.
   Anthony Eisenberg, 23, was listening to an undercover narcotics
officer testifying before the grand jury he was serving on July 18.
   ``The officer looked at Mr. Eisenberg and Mr. Eisenberg looked
at him and there was a nod of recognition,'' G. Christopher Marzuk,
a prosecutor with the Office of the Special Narcotics Prosecutor,
told The New York Times Wednesday.
   The next day, after reviewing his notes about the May 26 sale of
two glassine envelopes of heroin, the officer returned to the jury
room, where the suspect was quietly removed and arrested.
   ``A lot of people said that it was the stupidest thing in the
world for him to go down there and sit on the narcotics grand
jury,'' Marzuk said. ``On the other hand, it could also have been
the smartest thing in the world, because if Mr. Eisenberg had gone
for the full month of the grand jury's term _ sat through 100 or
150 cases _ he could have learned who all of our undercover
officers are and which ones were working in his area.''
   Eisenberg saw seven undercover agents during his 1{ days as a
grand juror.
   He was indicted on charges of felony sale of narcotics.

   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee says the Senate-approved $885 million drought-relief
package is fair to all farmers who suffer crop and livestock losses.
   ``The most important thing about this bill is that all farmers
are being treated fairly,'' panel chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said after the measure passed Wednesday.
   ``Those who suffer a significant loss will receive the same
payment rate _ 65 percent of the applicable target price or loan
rate,'' he said. ``We will not discriminate against any farmer who
needs help. This legislation treats all farmers fairly, whether
they grow wheat, corn, hay or soybeans.''
   But the measure, passed by voice vote toward the end of a long
Senate business day, was considerably more modest than a
House-passed version that many lawmakers criticized as too
expensive.
   Members of the House and Senate Agriculture committees planned
to begin negotiations on a compromise version today, with the aim
of completing that work before Congress leaves Friday on a
month-long recess, Leahy's office said.
   The Senate bill makes farmers eligible for federal aid if they
have crop losses this year because of drought, flooding, freezing,
hail, high winds or similar severe weather. It also provides for
payments to livestock producers facing drought-related feed and
water shortages for their herds.
   But its price tag is about $463 million less than the
Agriculture Department has estimated the cost of a rival
House-passed package.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said winter wheat
producers and other crop growers will be eligible for high-priority
attention under provisions of the legislation.
   ``This is not the best bill, nor is it the kind of relief winter
wheat producers and other program crops deserve,'' he said. ``But
it is far better than the budget-busting House bill which promised
federal relief to every crop in America.''
   The Senate also passed by voice vote late Wednesday rural
development legislation designed to promote business investment and
expansion in small towns in rural America. It also is aimed at
improving schools and health care for residents.
   Proponents argued that federal assistance was needed because the
61 million people living in rural areas face higher unemployment,
more hospital closings and higher poverty levels than their urban
counterparts. The rural economy also is more volatile because of
its dependence on natural resources, supporters said.
   The centerpiece of the package, called the ``rural partnership
act,'' is a revolving loan fund program to provide $300 million in
seed money over five years for new and expanding businesses.
   The Senate's disaster-relief bill provides for different
eligibility standards for various crops, but in all cases producers
would receive payments designed to cover 65 percent of their lost
income from crop losses.
   In most instances, the projected income levels will be based on
federal crop subsidies or average market prices farmers would have
received had they not suffered losses.
   The House bill required a minimum loss of 35 percent for any
crop to receive assistance, with payments covering 65 percent of
lost income. But unlike the Senate bill, the House measure called
for 90 percent payments on crop losses of more than 75 percent.
   The Senate dropped the higher payment level as a way of cutting
the overall cost of the assistance package.
   Farm-state senators objected to a provision in the House bill
that would prevent spending on drought assistance to exceed the
amount of agricultural subsidy savings and would have prorated
relief payments to farmers if necessary.
   In general, spending on subsidy programs is expected to be lower
this year because crop prices are higher as a result of smaller
harvests linked to weather problems.

<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with comment from Exxon spokesman,

declining to comment. No pickup. A longer version moved on the financial

<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service has billed Exxon
Corp. and Texaco Inc. for more than $2 billion in back taxes and
interest, but the huge oil companies said they will challenge the
claims in court.
   Texaco said Wednesday the IRS claims the oil company owns $1.79
billion in taxes from 1979 to 1981, when it sold oil to its
affiliates at below-market value.
   Exxon Corp. said the IRS has billed it $269 million for 1979 in
connection with oil the government of Saudi Arabia sold to Exxon
and Texaco in a bid to stabilize the world crude market. Interest
on the Exxon payments could double the amount of money the IRS
seeks.
   ``They're trying to get us to pay for something we never earned
and which the American public benefited from,'' said Exxon
spokesman Bill Smith. ``We sold oil at lower prices. The American
public got the benefit of those lower prices.''
   Exxon said it had filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court in
Washington over the IRS bill. Texaco, based in White Plains, said
it also would fight the IRS claim.
   The IRS had notified Texaco about possible claims stemming from
the earlier oil transaction with the Saudis during an audit last
year in connection with Texaco's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   The IRS claims are over the handling of crude oil purchased from
Saudi Arabia during 1979-1981, when the official price set by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was $34 a barrel.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest exporter, was selling its crude for
$28 a barrel to Texaco, Exxon, Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., its
four partners in the Arabian American Oil Co. with the provision
that if any of the companies resold the oil, they could not resell
it at a profit.
   Texaco said the IRS apparently believed that when it resold the
crude to its foreign affiliates, it should have charged the $34
rate despite the restrictions by Saudia Arabia _ and paid taxes on
the difference.
   Because it did not, Texaco said it is being held liable for
taxes on the profits that its foreign affiliates made by being able
to sell refined products made from the cheaper Saudi oil.
   IRS officials have declined to comment on the matter, saying
federal law prohibits the agency from commenting on the affairs of
any taxpayer.
   ``Texaco maintains that the IRS's position is wrong, and that it
cannot tax the company for revenues it never received when it
resold the Arabian crude and which, under mandate of the Saudi
Arabian government, it could not receive,'' Texaco said in a
statement.

   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani was
sworn in today as president and pledged to continue the 10-year-old
Islamic revolution, Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   ``Despite the propaganda coming from the arrogant world powers,
our people will not accept anything but the continuation of this
path, which is the path of Islam and the Koran,'' he said in a
speech carried by the news agency.
   Rafsanjani's speech came after the swearing-in ceremony attended
by top religious and government leaders. The one-hour ceremony was
held at a mosque attached to the home of the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran, said IRNA,
which was monitored in Nicosia.
   Rafsanjani apparently made no public reference to the first
crisis facing his presidency: a death threat against American
hostage Joseph Cicippio, held in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem extremists.
   Rafsanjani, 54, the Islamic Republic's fifth president, is
considered a pragmatist who would like to ease tight governmental
control of the economy, and resume ties with the West.
   He succeeds Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who became the country's
spiritual leader after the June 3 death of Khomeini, Iran's
patriarch of the 1979 revolution that deposed Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi.
   In a statement read by Khomeini's son, Ahmad, the outgoing
president urged Rafsanjani to use the presidency's increased powers
to solve the nation's problems and ease hardships faced by the
poor, IRNA said.
   Ahmad's reading of Khamenei's statement appeared to amount to a
declaration of support for Rafsanjani. The younger Khomeini has
been considered a leader of the hard-liners who are locked in a
power struggle with the new president's pragmatist faction.
   Rafsanjani won a landslide victory in Friday's presidential
elections, capturing 94.5 percent of the vote. Constitutional
reforms approved in a referendum during the election give him
considerably enlarged powers by scrapping Prime Minister Hussein
Musavi's post.
   Earlier this week, Khamenei told Musavi in a letter to continue
his duties as prime minister until a new Cabinet is set up by
Rafsanjani.
   The presidential elections, originally scheduled for Aug. 18,
were advanced by about three weeks to hasten the transfer of power
after Khomeini's death.
   Khamenei's decision to step down as president before the end of
his term appeared aimed at allowing Rafsanjani to move quickly to
start reforming Iran's sluggish economy.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black Catholics gathering for their first laity
conference since a breakawy by a Washington priest are preparing to
shape their own agenda and prod church officials to address their
cultural needs.
   The schism over race and church policies that boiled over last
month when the Rev. George Stallings split from the archdiocese and
launched a splinter congregation is of major concern to those here
for the four-day conference, which starts today.
   Stallings was suspended for founding the Imani Temple, which
holds ceremonies that mix Catholic prayers and liturgy with African
and black American religious tradition.
   Stallings contends the church has failed to deal with racism. He
also says his brand of Catholicism better addresses the cultural
and spiritual needs of black parishioners.
   ``Now is the time for the laity to come forth and take a
stand,'' said the Rev. James Goode, a San Francisco priest in
Atlanta for the conference. ``You have to stand up and speak the
truth and face the consequences.''
   Goode praised Stallings' movement as ``a beautiful time of
coming together of African-American Catholics across the country.
   ``The church has to be challenged, no question about it. We
cannot continue as we are,'' Goode said. ``Things that people were
talking about in the back room now are being talked about in the
open.
   People still see the Catholic Church as run white males, he
said. ``That whole thing escalated with the Father Stallings
issue.''
   Walter Hubbard, executive director of the National Office for
Black Catholics, said the laity conference wants to address ``what
has been raised to a level of consciousness by Reverend Stallings.''
   ``There's a rich history in the church of African men and women
being part of the genesis of the church. It's not told too
frequently,'' he said.
   ``The church has to come to understand more and more that we
have a need to exercise and focus on our own culture,'' Hubbard
said. ``We've got to shape our own agenda. That's our goal.
   ``What you have seen and what you have heard on this issue is an
expression from the clergy, seminarians and the deacons,'' Hubbard
said. ``You really have not heard from the lay people.''
   Hubbard said Stallings had not confirmed whether he would attend
the meeting. Stallings did not return telephone calls Thursday to
Imani Temple.
   About 400 people are expected to attend the conference,
sponsored by Hubbard's group and the National Black Lay Catholic
Caucus. Workshops have topics ranging from ``Catholicism and
Blackness: Is There A Future?'' to ``When The Saints Go Marching In
_ Black Catholics Will Be In That Number.''
   Goode, described as a ``soul-moving'' preacher, is scheduled to
address the group Saturday.
   Archbishop Eugene Marino of Atlanta, the church's first black
archbishop, and Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York,
also are scheduled to speak.

<HEAD>Man Charged With Killing Seven Has Brain Dysfunction, Attorney Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The attorney for a former winery
employee charged with killing six family members and a co-worker
said tests indicate his client has a brain dysfunction.
   ``I was hoping for something like this and I've confirmed it,''
Sonoma County Public Defender Marteen Miller, attorney for Ramon
Salcido, said Wednesday.
   Salcido, 28, a former employee of Grand Cru Winery near Glen
Ellen, is accused of murdering seven people on April 14, including
his wife, Angela, 24, and two daughters, Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 2,
whose throats were slashed. A third daughter, Carmina, 3, survived.
   He also is accused of killing his wife's mother, Marion
Richards, 47; his wife's sisters, Ruth Richards, 12, and Marie
Richards, 8, and a winery co-worker, Tracy Toovey, 35.
   He is accused of attempted murder of another co-worker, Kenneth
Butti, who was wounded; Butti's wife, Terri, and Carmina.
   The tests were done by a neuropsychologist and interpreted by a
neurologist, said Miller, who plans to have more extensive tests
conducted at the University of California at Irvine Medical
Department.
   Miller previously said the technology available at UC Irvine is
more sophisticated than anywhere else in the state. The attorney
said he won't know how he'll use the findings in Salcido's defense
until all tests are completed.

<HEAD>Arms-For-Drugs Figure Arrives After Fleeing Costa Rica</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A key figure in an alleged guns-for-drugs network
aimed at financing the Contras has arrived in Miami after fleeing a
Costa Rican indictment, and a U.S. Senate committee wants to talk
to him.
   John Hull, 69, a U.S.-born Costa Rican rancher, was identified
by federal prosecutors and the congressional Iran-Contra committee
as a point man in former National Security Council aide Oliver
North's efforts to funnel aid to Nicaraguan rebels.
   A Costa Rican investigation resulted in his indictment there
earlier this year for violating that nation's neutrality and drug
trafficking laws, although an investigating judge dismissed the
drug counts Wendesday.
   Hull surfaced in Miami Wednesdsay after jumping $37,500 bail in
Costa Rica, saying he was seeking medical treatment for a heart
ailment.
   He acknowledged working with the CIA, accepting bodyguards from
the agency and taking $10,000 a month from a Contra leader, but
strongly denied the landing strips on his Costa Rican farm were
used by drug traffickers.
   ``There have never been drugs on any of my air strips,'' Hull
told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``At this point I can
honestly say I have never even seen cocaine.''
   Five witnesses last year told a Senate investigatory
subcommittee headed by U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., that drugs
were flown through Hull's farm back to the United States on the
same planes that brought in weapons for the Contras. Hull was
subpoenaed by the committee to testify, but never showed up.
   Jonathan Winer, counsel to Kerry, said on learning Hull had
returned to the United States that the subcommittee wanted to talk
to him as soon as possible.
   ``Hull is under subpoena and has been for a year, and we will
seek to serve him,'' Winer said. ``We've sought to serve him
before, but he has been in Costa Rica, and, from our point of view,
evading the subpoena.''
   Hull blames the drug charges on a plot by his enemies to
discredit him and U.S. policy in Central America.
   ``It's basically a misinformation campaign carried on by the
communists and drug traffickers as a smokescreen,'' he said. ``And
the fact is that the communists have to get people like me out of
the way to subvert the country.''
   Hull acknowledges receiving about $10,000 a month from Contra
leader Adolfo Calero to feed and supply the rebels on Nicaragua's
southern border. But he denies knowing the money was provided on
orders from North.
   Hull, from Evanston, Ind., denied working for North or the
National Security Council. He admitted meeting with North's aide
Rob Owen in Costa Rica, but said Owen was simply an ``old friend''
he knew through the office of then-Sen. Dan Quayle.

   Four bodies have been recovered from an
oil rig that capsized in the Gulf of Mexico, with six crewmen still
missing and feared drowned, the Coast Guard said today.
   Three bodies were recovered Wednesday and another one overnight,
the Coast Guard said. The Guard had reported earlier that divers
found two bodies overnight but later said that information was
incorrect.
   Divers continued to search the submerged crew compartments today
for the remaining six crewmen, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Matt
McGovern in New Orleans.
   The rig, about 20 miles south of Morgan City, fell on its side
in 30 feet of water Monday while heading inland as Hurricane
Chantal approached.
   Four crewmen were rescued immediately.
   Authorities hoped some of the missing crewmen might have
survived in airtight compartments aboard the vessel, leased by
Chevron. The search, delayed by rough seas in the wake of Chantal,
resumed Wednesday.
   Chevron spokesman Jonathan Lifa said the three bodies recovered
Wednesday were found in the crew's quarters.
   The identities of the dead men were being withheld pending
notification of their families, Lifa said.
   The names of the missing crewmen have not been released. They
worked for Lafitte Welding of Lafitte, Global Divers of New Iberia,
and Owensby Kritkos of Gretna, officials said.

   Sinhalese radicals shot and killed 18
people, including nine relatives of a legislator, officials said
today.
   In another attack, radicals wearing police uniforms raided a
government armory and shot and wounded five officers before
escaping, police said.
   The attacks on the civilians occurred Wednesday night in and
around the town of Kalutara, 25 miles south of Colombo, government
officials said.
   The victims included nine relatives of lawmaker P.D. Abeyaratna,
who were gunned down at his home in Kalutara, the officials said on
condition of anonymity. The lawmaker was not home at the time of
the attack.
   The other civilians killed in the area included four workers at
a government cement factory, a physician and his assistant, the
officials said.
   No further details on the attacks were immediately available.
   A police officer said at least 15 Sinhalese radicals entered a
Colombo police armory unchallenged on Wednesday and apparently
escaped without injury.
   The officer, who requested anonymity, said the radicals took 25
automatic rifles from the armory in the suburb of Thimbirgasyaya.
Two vans used by the radicals were found abandoned later about four
miles away, the officer said.
   He said authorities conducted a house-to-house search of the
area and deployed helicopters using night lights but found no sign
of the radicals.
   In what police called a diversionary tactic, bombs exploded in
three other areas of the capital minutes before the raid, injuring
one civilian.
   Sinhalese radicals have been attacking the government since
1987, saying it has made too many concessions to the nation's Tamil
minority.
   In a bid to appease Tamil rebels, the Sinhalese-dominated
government in July 1987 offered limited autonomy to areas in which
Tamils make up the majority of residents. The rebels have been
fighting for an independent nation since 1983.
   At least 4,000 people, mainly government officials, have been
killed in attacks by Sinhalese radicals. The Tamil insurgency has
claimed 11,000 lives.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
the Sinhalese make up 75 percent. Tamils accuse the Sinhalese of
discriminating against them in jobs and education.

<HEAD>Oral Roberts Ministry Dismisses 10 Percent Of Workforce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oral Roberts' evangelical empire, besieged
by financial problems and declining donations, has laid off more
than 10 percent of its 2,300 employees.
   The cost-cutting move is the latest attempt by the ministry to
recover from more than two years of financial hardships highlighted
by two dramatic fund-raising pleas by Oral Roberts that have netted
$19 million.
   Roberts' son, Richard, head of business operations for the
ministry, said Wednesday that 250 employees, mostly support staff,
have been dismissed.
   He would not say how much money would be saved with the layoffs.
``I refuse to equate money with human beings,'' he said.
   The dismissals were ministrywide but did not include Oral
Roberts University faculty, officials said.
   The cuts came as an accreditation team continued its
investigation of the university's medical school. University
officials said the review team has been at the school since early
this week.
   Seven of 10 department chairmen and the interim medical school
dean have resigned or been fired since March. The number of staff
doctors at the affiliated City of Faith Medical and Research Center
also has dwindled from 118 two years ago to 52 today.
   The ministry completed an $11 million fund-raising effort in May
to pay six months worth of past-due bills. The elder Roberts told
followers then that contributions had dropped dramatically in the
past two years.
   Richard Roberts said the ministry has maintained $2.5 million in
donations a month since May, a 50 percent drop from two years ago.
   In 1987, Oral Roberts completed an $8 million fund-raising
campaign, claiming God would ``call me home'' if he failed.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson registered to vote in the
District of Columbia today, a move that would qualify him to run
for mayor in 1990.
   The former presidential candidate and his wife, Jacqueline,
spent about 10 minutes filling out a series of forms, and
registered as Democrats, according to city elections officials.
   After registering, Jackson read a statement outlining his
political agenda, which he said includes education, the eradication
of drugs and statehood for the district.
   He again refused comment on whether he would enter the city's
1990 mayoral race, saying instead he would turn his attention
towards getting statehood for the nation's capital.
   City law requires that mayoral candidates be registered to vote
in the district at least one year before the general election. The
next election is scheduled for Nov. 6, 1990.
   Jackson, who moved to the nation's capital from Chicago last
weekend, has not ruled out running for mayor.
   He has said he would never run against Mayor Marion Barry Jr.,
an ally from the civil rights movement, but after Barry declared he
would seek a fourth term Jackson refused to take himself out of
consideration.
   The two-time Democratic presidential hopeful has said he was
moving to the nation's capital to be closer to the legislative
process. The national offices of the Rainbow Coalition, his
political organization, is moving here as well.
   He is living in a northwest Washington apartment while the home
he purchased in 1984 is being renovated. He has said he has no
plans to sell his Chicago home.

   Here is a state-by-state look at wildfires burning in the West:
   IDAHO: Hundreds of lightning-caused fires have burned 90,000
acres, and more than 6,200 firefighters were on the lines. The
threat to two small mountain towns eased as cool weather slowed the
fires, but the forecast of rising temperatures through the weekend
had fire bosses worried.
   OREGON: Fires east of the Cascades have burned 88,000 acres and
were being fought Wednesday by 4,400 people. The worst of the
lightning-caused blazes were around Baker and the town of John Day.
   CALIFORNIA: More than 35,000 acres have burned, but the fire in
the Sierra Nevada foothills that destroyed homes over the weekend
has been contained. An 8,200-acre brush fire in the Cleveland
National Forest southeast of Los Angeles was 50 percent contained
today, but was within 5 miles of the Palomar Observatory and was
threatening a nature preserve that contains trees unusual in the
area.
   MONTANA: A fire burning in grassland and scattered timber in the
Custer National Forest was nearly contained at 800 acres. About 300
firefighters battled the blaze, which was started by lightning
Monday.
   WASHINGTON: Crews were mopping up an 850-acre forest fire in the
Pasayten Wilderness near the Canadian border. The first of more
than 1,000 Army troops trained at Fort Lewis to help fight fires
departed Wednesday for Oregon.

   Hurricane Dean, packing 85 mph
winds, veered away from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
today on a wobbly course in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters said.
   The National Weather Service lifted hurricane warnings for all
the islands of the eastern Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Forecasters said Dean was moving farther out to sea and that the
worst effects would probably miss the islands.
   The government of the Bahamas had a hurricane watch in effect
for the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the Bahamas.
   A flash-flood watch remained in effect for the Virgin Islands,
but it was lifted for Puerto Rico, where the National Guard earlier
had been preparing to evacuate 2,000 people from flood-prone areas.
   At noon EDT, the hurricane's center was at latitude 19.5 north
and longitude 63.3 west, or 200 miles east-northeast of San Juan.
The weather service in San Juan said if Dean remained on its
current course it would pass 125 miles north of the Virgin Islands
and 150 miles north of Puerto Rico.
   ``The biggest problem in the islands is usually flash floods and
mudslides, so there is some potential for that, but it's not going
to be as if the core of the storm was coming across there,'' said
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   He said the strom was curving northward, away from land, so
there was no immediate threat to the United States.
   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, strengthened
overnight as it moved irregularly in a west-northwest course
through the Leeward Island chain, missing the nearest island,
Barbuda.
   By late Wednesday it began veering northwest, giving many
residents and vacationers hope the hurricane would harmlessly go
out to sea. But just as quickly, the hurricane darted back west and
toward land.
   ``This is dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly even
though it is a minimal hurricane,'' said an advisory from the
National Weather Service in San Juan.
   Police were on alert, and at least 60 American and Canadian
vacationers were evacuated late Wednesay to hotels from a marina
resort on the east coast of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands.
   The National Hurricane Center near Miami posted hurricane
warnings on Wednesday for the Leeward Islands from Antigua to the
U.S. Virgin Islands, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
   A Weather Service advisory issued in San Juan for the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico advised residents to ``secure loose
objects or move them indoors,'' board or tape windows and stock up
on emergency supplies such as drinking water, food that needs no
refrigeration and batteries.
   In San Juan, a city of 1.1 million people, shoppers on Wednesday
formed long lines in supermarkets, workers boarded up windows of
the governor's mansion and stores in the tourist district of Old
San Juan.
   In the eastern Puerto Rican city of Humacao, Mayor Ramon Vega
Sosa said he asked Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon to mobilize the
National Guard to evacuate 1,966 residents who live along a highway
that runs along the coastline, which is five feet from the sea.
   Dean grew from the fifth tropical depression of the season
Monday morning into a named storm by Monday night.
   Three other storms have formed since the season began June 1.
   Tropical Storm Allison caused widespread flooding in Texas and
Louisiana in June. Barry churned up the open Atlantic last month
before dissipating.
   Chantal became a hurricane Monday and was downgraded to a
tropical depression Tuesday night after hitting land in Texas.

<HEAD>Former President Marks Birthday; New Operation Possible</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Habib Bourguiba marked
his 86th birthday Thursday in the hospital where he underwent a
prostate operation last month.
   There was no celebration of his birthday in Tunisia, where it
was once a national holiday, and most Tunisian newspapers took no
notice of the event.
   By coincidence, the day was a public holiday in Tunisia because
it was the Islamic new year.
   The weekly magazine Realites reported Thursday, without citing
sources, that Bourguiba might need a second operation to clear his
urinary tract.
   The government authorized 27 members of Bourguiba's family to
visit him in the hospital on the occasion of his birthday,
including his son, former Foreign Minister Habib Bourguiba Jr., the
magazine said.
   When Bourguiba tried to include four former members of his
government in the list of his birthday guests, ``these persons were
not authorized to visit him,'' it said.
   Bourguiba was ousted in a bloodless coup in 1987 by his prime
minister, Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who said the president was
senile and unable to carry on his duties.

<HEAD>Spacecraft Finds Three New Moons Around Neptune</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 7 grafs of details and background.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Images from the Voyager 2 spacecraft
revealed three previously unknown moons circling Neptune,
scientists at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced today.
   The discoveries, in addition to a moon spotted by Voyager 2 last
month, bring to six the number of satellites known to be orbiting
the blue planet, laboratory officials said.
   Voyager was more than 22 million miles from Neptune when the
moons were confirmed by scientists Wednesday, indicating there may
be many more discoveries as the space probe draws even closer in
coming weeks.
   The newly discovered moons were temporarily named 1989 N2, 1989
N3 and 1989 N4. The objects were tracked as ``candidate moons'' for
five days and then confirmed when they followed predicted orbits.
   The moons appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in
diameter and are in circular, equatorial orbits moving in the
direction of the planet's rotation. Neptune's big moon, Triton,
moves in the opposite direction.
   The moon 1989 N3 is closest to the planet, orbiting 17,000 miles
above Neptune's cloud tops and completing one orbit every 8 hour
and 10 minutes.
   Orbiting 23,000 miles above the clouds, 1989 N4 circles Neptune
in 10 hours and 20 minutes.
   The farthest out of the three, 1989 N2 is 30,000 miles above the
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes.
   Voyager 2 is on a course that will take it within 3,000 miles of
Neptune on Aug. 24. The spacecraft was launched in 1977 and has
been past Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. It is more than 2.7 billion
miles from Earth.
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory operates America's unmanned spacecraft
exploring the solar system.

<HEAD>Private Businessmen Latest Targets of Government Attack</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

   China's tiny but prosperous private business
community is the latest target of the government's crackdown on
so-called bourgeois evils.
   The bar owners and street vendors who once were the envy of
their neighbors now worry they may be shut down in the leftist
atmosphere that has followed the June army attack on student
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``Things are no good now. I'm trying to unload my business,''
said a clothing vendor in one of the city's largest private
markets. ``But no one wants to buy.''
   In the past decade, 14.5 million individually owned businesses
have sprung up across China, most of them vendors or offering
services such as bicycle repairs and hair cuts. They opened on the
promise of senior leader Deng Xiaoping that, after years of
enforced egalitarianism, it was permissible for some people to get
rich before others.
   Soon teachers and office workers began discovering that barely
literate snack vendors pulled in more money than they. Many young
businessmen bought motorcycles; a few could even afford cars.
   What the Chinese call the ``red-eyed disease'' _ envy _ became
epidemic.
   Hoping perhaps to bridge the deep gulf between the leadership
and an alienated urban population, Communist Party General
Secretary Jiang Zemin has seized upon this envy and made ``unfair
distribution'' of income a key theme of his first month in office.
   ``Self-employed traders and peddlars cheat, embezzle, bribe and
evade taxation,'' he wrote in the newspaper China Labor. ``On some
small commodity markets, over 80 percent of the self-employed have
an annual income exceeding 10,000 yuan ($2,700), five times higher
than that of the average government employee.
   ``These upstarts ... indulge in a life of luxury,'' he wrote.
``This greatly hurts the confidence of workers ... who live on
salaries. It has affected social stability and corrupted social
values.''
   Jiang has repeated the message in other essays and speeches, and
newspaper commentators have chimed in. All condemn alleged
illegalities by private businessmen. But the greatest offense seems
simply to be making money.
   ``How much do individual businessmen make?'' asked the party
newspaper, the People's Daily. ``No one really knows but them. But
the wives of some private bosses wear outfits that cost more than
1,000 yuan ($270) and not one, but several gold rings on their
fingers.''
   Such articles worry businessmen like Duan, who along with his
brother opened the Rose Bar two months ago on a busy Beijing street.
   ``For two years we've been going south and looking at bars,''
said Duan, who gave only his surname. ``But we didn't dare open one
in Beijing earlier.''
   In recent months, however, even staid Beijing began blossoming
with private bars, dance halls and pool halls.
   So Duan and his brother, who had saved money as a private
clothing seller, pooled about $5,350 to rent and renovate a
storefront.
   Then the army declared martial law May 20 to quell the student
protests, and armed police began dropping by to inspect customers'
identification papers. ``It was very bad for business,'' Duan said,
but he fears the newspaper criticisms bode even worse.
   ``I'm worried the government might shut us down. Then we'll lose
everything,'' he said, drinking a beer in his tiny, smoky bar.
   ``I don't like politics,'' he said. ``I don't understand
politics.''
   Bars are especially vulnerable because they represent a loose,
``bourgeois'' lifestyle the aging revolutionaries now in the
forefront are determined to wipe out.
   Two bars near the Rose Bar were shut down in the past month for
running prostitution rings. At the Rose Bar, four ``bar girls''
keep company with the male customers, flirting in exchange for
drinks. Whether they do anything else was not clear.
   Already, authorities have moved to increase controls on private
businessmen. The central government has announced special
inspections of their books and the quality of their products.
Several provincial governments have said businessmen will have to
submit their salaries for approval to ensure they don't earn too
much.
   But Duan's drinking friend, Yang, said he's confident the
private sector won't be shut down altogether. He reminded: ``Marx
said socialism means `to each according to his labor.'''

<HEAD>Kremlin Official Sees Bumper Crop, But Harvest Not Assured</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's European breadbasket is growing
a bumper grain crop, but shortages of spare parts and fuel are
hurting chances that farmers will be able to bring all the crop in.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, the Communist Party Politburo member in
charge of agriculture, said on Soviet TV Wednesday night that such
key farming regions as the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia, and the
Krasnodar, Stavropol and Rostov regions of southern Russia are
looking forward to a bumper harvest.
   The struggle to put more food on empty store shelves is not only
an economic problem, but a big political headache for President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He has been tinkering with the inefficient, state-run farm
system almost constantly since taking power four years ago, and a
good growing season could give him the kind of sorely needed
victory that has eluded his reform efforts.
   Newspapers follow the grain harvest, which is just getting into
full swing, nearly every day with front-page stories, and the
government newspaper Izvestia on July 19 cited reports of ``high,
and in some places record harvests.''
   Ligachev said the good news from the fields means ``we have all
possibilities to harvest enough crop as a whole,'' despite a
serious drought in grain-growing regions of Siberia and Kazakhstan,
and the chronic struggle with spare parts and fuel for combines,
and storage.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which closely follows the
Soviet grain crops, estimates the harvest will be about 210 million
tons, on a par with 1986 and 1987, and better than last year's
harvest of 195 million tons. Last year's crop was damaged by a dry
growing season, but damp weather that slowed harvesting.
   In story after story, however, Izvestia has warned that a good
crop doesn't guarantee a good harvest. The newspaper ended a biting
July 31 piece on the shortage of parts for combines in the Ukraine
and Russia with the depressing observation the harvest is so
inefficient that ``the more you grow, the more you lose.''
   Another story said fuel for the combines was in short supply
throughout the Ukraine.
   Ligachev said the Soviet Union loses 30 percent of its harvest
because of poor processing, and he cited conclusions by Dutch
specialists that Soviet food processing is decades behind the West.
   A Western diplomat who specializes in Soviet agricultural said
the improved crop appeared to a result of good weather rather than
anything Gorbachev has done.
   Mild weather minimized winter kill of grain planted in fall, and
timely rain has kept both spring and winter grains growing well, he
said.
   Gorbachev has abolished a Moscow superagency that oversaw
agricultural policy and a meeting of the party Central Committee in
March set the groundwork for allowing farmers to lease land to
partially break away from the inefficiency of the state-run system.
   Moscow has also promised payments in hard currency to farms that
delivery grain to the state over their assigned quotas.
   But the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
specialists ``haven't seen any indication that people are leasing
land in great numbers.''
   He also said that inefficiencies in the harvest, the weather in
the next six weeks, and the drought east of the Ural Mountains
could seriously damage the final harvest.
   Estimates of last year's harvest plummeted last fall because
damp weather prevented farmers from getting into the fields, he
said.

<HEAD>Another 4,000 Emigrate Last Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union continued
at more than twice last year's rate in July, with nearly 4,000
arrivals at a Vienna transit center, a resettlement agency said
Thursday.
   Soviet authorities allowed 3,971 Jews to leave last month, six
more than in June, which raised the year's total to 24,133,
according to a spokeswoman for the Geneva-based Intergovernmental
Committee for Migration.
   Only 104 of the latest arrivals chose to move on directly to
Israel, said spokeswoman Regina Boucault, with 717 emigres
resettled in the Jewish state this year. Most are going to the
United States.
   In June, 3,965 Jews left the Soviet Union, making the total for
the six months of 1989 already higher than last year's flow of
20,082.
   About 300,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement
program began in 1971. The largest official exodus, 51,328, was
recorded in 1979, before the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
chilled East-West relations.

   The Bush administration's clean air bill,
attacked by environmental activists as a sellout to industry, was
introduced in the Senate today with only three Democrats joining 21
Republican sponsors.
   Despite a strong effort by the administration to line up
sponsors from both parties, only Democratic Sens. Donald W. Riegle
Jr. of Michigan, J. James Exon of Nebraska and John Breaux of
Louisiana signed on as co-sponsors.
   The bill was introduced in the House with 57 Democratic and 90
Republican co-sponsors.
   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I. and the bill's chief Senate sponsor,
referred to the lack of Democratic support indirectly, commenting,
``The introduction of the president's bill is not the end of the
process, but a major advance in the march.''
   Chafee, the ranking GOP member of the Senate Environment
Committee, added, ``After eight years of silence from the White
House on this issue, we now have a chief executive who recognizes
the need for a major overhaul of the Clean Air Act.''
   The administration moved on Wednesday to blunt criticism of the
legislation by meeting with environmental groups that have
criticized the bill.
   ``At this point, it's an information discussion and not a
negotiating session,'' said assistant EPA Administrator William
Rosenberg, assistant Environmental Protection Agency commissioner,
who met with top White House officials and seven environmental
groups.
   ``The administration's bill stands as it is,'' Rosenberg said,
also telling reporters that President Bush had briefly dropped by
the meeting.
   Richard Ayres, head of the National Clean Air Coalition,
characterized the administration officials at the meeting as ``very
upset by the criticism the bill has got from the environmental
community and members of Congress.''
   ``We responded with equal vehemence that `we don't think you've
been unfairly attacked. We believe what we're saying is based on
the facts.'''
   Participants said the administration promised future meetings.
   The environmentalists, who have characterized the legislation as
a gift to industry, said they told the administration the bill
would not protect public health and in some cases weakens current
law.
   The invitations to Wednesday's meeting immediately became
controversial because the White House initially failed to invite
Ayres, whose organization is the main environmental lobbying group
on clean air. He was summoned to the White House just 15 minutes
before the meeting began.
   An EPA source said EPA Administrator William Reilly and
Rosenberg, assistant administrator for air programs, ``were shocked
that Ayres was not invited'' and demanded the White House change
its mind. The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The meeting concentrated on the portion of the bill seeking to
curb acid rain, a form of pollution caused by emissions of sulfur
dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from power plants, autos and other
sources. These pollutants can be carried thousands of miles through
the atmosphere, and eventually return to earth as sulfuric or
nitric acids, ruining lakes, streams and forests.
   Environmentalists have considered the acid rain section the
strongest part of the legislation, because it would reduce sulfur
dioxide emissions by 10 million tons by the end of 2000 and ``cap''
the lower emissions figure to prevent growth of the pollutant in
the 21st century.
   But even this section has aroused criticism, with
environmentalists contending the real sulfur dioxide decrease would
be 9 million tons, while nitrogen dioxide would actually grow by 1
million tons by the end of 2000.
   The major unhappiness, however, has been with the sections on
urban smog and releases of toxic chemicals into the air, and
Rosenberg promised to hold further discussions on both topics,
participants said.

<TEXT>
   The House today passed legislation
liberalizing abortion restrictions in the District of Columbia, and
President Bush immediately threatened a veto.
   In a letter to Congress, Bush urged lawmakers to ``protect the
lives of America's unborn children.''
   The confrontation came over the first vote in either house of
Congress since the Supreme Court ruling last month permitting
states to impose further restrictions on abortion.
   On a 238-189 vote, the chamber approved a bill providing $532
million in federal funds for the district's government that
contained the abortion provision. The bill now moves to the Senate.
   Pro-choice advocates hailed the House vote as a turnaround and
predicted it will help reverse the tide nationwide against moves to
restrict abortion.
   The White House today released a letter Bush sent Congress on
Wednesday threatening the veto.
   ``If the bill presented to me permits the use of appropriated
funds to pay for abortions other than those where the life of the
mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term, I
will veto it,'' Bush wrote Rep. Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., chairman
of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the District of Columbia.
   In a dramatic roll call that stunned lawmakers on both sides,
the House voted 219-206 Wednesday against an amendment banning
public financing of all abortions in the District of Columbia. As
the final tally became apparent, pro-choice lawmakers on the
chamber's floor embraced each other and roared with emotion.
   It was the first congressional showdown on the issue since the
Supreme Court decision last month enhancing state authority to
limit abortion, and a reversal of a 222-186 House vote on the same
question last summer.
   Abortion rights advocates said it was the first time since 1980
that the House had rejected an effort to restrict public financing
for abortions.
   The amendment would have banned the use of federal or district
funds to perform any abortions during the 1990 federal fiscal year,
which begins Oct. 1.
   Instead, the bill now would liberalize current law by allowing
the district to spend its own money for abortions and permitting
the use of federal funds in cases of rape, incest or to save the
mother's life. Current law forbids the use of federal or district
funds in Washington unless the mother's life is at stake.
   But the effect of the measure's rejection carried well beyond
the capital's borders, thanks to the high court's July 3 ruling in
the Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services case, abortion rights
advocates said. They said that with surveys showing most Americans
still support the right to choose abortion, Thursday's battle
showed lawmakers know their constituents are watching them.
   ``There is more emphasis on voting records in this issue now,''
Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., of the Appropriations District of
Columbia subcommittee said after the vote. ``The politics of it has
been turned up somewhat.''
   ``People since Webster understand this game is for real now,''
said another lawmaker who backs the right to abortion, Rep. Barbara
Boxer, D-Calif.
   Supporters of the defeated provision credited the high court's
ruling with making the abortion issue a more delicate one. But they
also blamed their loss on freshmen lawmakers more sympathetic to
abortion than the legislators they replaced, and to misleading
lobbying by their opponents.
   The amendment, sponsored by Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif.,
contained no exceptions to the ban on public money for abortions.
   During the debate, he and his supporters repeatedly said they
intended to add an exception for pregnancies that threatened the
mother's life, but didn't because it would have left the provision
vulnerable to being stricken from the bill for procedural reasons.
   Opponents of the amendment, however, stressed the provision
contained no such language and that voters would look unkindly at a
vote for such a harsh measure. Some of them stood at the entrance
to the House chamber, telling members as they arrived to vote that
the exception for endangered mothers was lacking.
   Dornan noted that in a letter President Bush sent to lawmakers
earlier in the day, the president promised to veto the bill if it
permitted the use of federal money for abortion, except for cases
involving the mother's survival.
   ``I'm disappointed that a pro-life message did not go out, but
we are going to win in the end anyway,'' he told reporters.
   In the Webster decision, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that states
may forbid public employees and facilities from participating in
abortions, even if patients are willing to pay their own expenses.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said today he
wouldn't prosecute reporters who obtain news leaks about criminal
investigations but would charge federal officials who are their
sources.
   Thornburgh said a new policy of prosecuting officials who leak
details of criminal investigations for theft of government property
does not include charging reporters with aiding and abetting or
receiving such information.
   ``The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in
misusing sensitive information that comes to them in an official
capacity,'' he said.
   ``Previous policy was not to use that authority. We have changed
that because of reasons I've stated more often then you want to
hear,'' the attorney general said at a news conference.
   Accurate leaks ``have a tendency to compromise ongoing
investigations,'' he said. ``If they are inaccurate, they have a
tendency to unjustifiably smear the reputations of persons who are
the subject of the leak.''
   The revision of the department's 11-year-old policy, intended to
protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution, was
announced Wednesday in testimony submitted to Congress.
   News reporters might be questioned about their sources in a
grand jury, under the policy, if the attorney general approves the
subpoena. Attorneys general historically have been reluctant to
subpoena reporters _ often the only source of information about
news leaks.
   But civil libertarians said it could pose dangers for reporters'
First Amendment protections to protect confidential sources.
   Jane Kirtley, executive director of the Reporters Committee for
Freedom of the Press, said today, ``While I certainly am pleased to
hear Mr. Thornburgh say he does not intend to prosecute journalists
who are the recipients of leaked information, I'm very troubled by
the probable implications of his plan to prosecute leakers.''
   ``Once the government is able to say `we need this information
because it's materal to a criminal investigation,' that raises the
question of whether or not the protection of a confidential source
is diluted,'' said Allan Adler, a Washington media lawyer and
former legislative counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Adler suggested the policy might be a first step toward
prosecuting journalists for aiding and abetting theft of government
information or illegally receiving it.
   But Thornburgh denied that was contemplated. ``I think that was
made clear,'' he said.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
constitutional and civil rights subcommittee, ``I think it would be
a definite misuse of the statute. The statute was not designed with
that in mind at all.''
   Edwards said the law ``has to do with stealing government
property. It doesn't have to do with leaks.''
   The Justice Department's 1978 policy said it was inappropriate
to prosecute an official for theft of property if the case involved
government information obtained in an otherwise legal way and
leaked to inform the public.
   John C. Keeney, a deputy assistant attorney general in the
criminal division, said in written testimony submitted to a
congressional hearing, ``We have recently re-examined the policy
and concluded it is too broad. Accordingly, it is no longer
applicable to government employees who leak information obtained
from a criminal investigation.''
   Keeney said it may also be applied ``in leak cases not arising
out of a criminal investigation if the employee's conduct also
violated some other provision such as the Privacy Act.''
   This could include the criminal investigation of leaks of
derogatory information collected during an FBI background
investigation of someone being considered for a Cabinet post.
   Keeney said the ``department is in the process of deciding
whether the policy should be changed in other respects.''
   Keeney submitted his statement at a hearing convened in the wake
of congressional criticism of leaks about an FBI investigation of
the office of Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   The Justice Department, which has said Gray is not a target of
the probe, has begun a leak investigation in response to those
complaints.
   Leslie Harris, legislative counsel at the ACLU, called Keeney's
announcement ``rather disturbing.''
   ``The question is whether they in fact intend to broaden it and
intend to use it as an official secrecy act, whenever they see fit.
We are going to be taking a look at this very carefully,'' she said.
   Former Pentagon employee Daniel Ellsberg was the first
government official prosecuted under the theft statute for leaking
the Pentagon Papers study of the Vietnam War. His case was
dismissed in 1973 because of prosecutorial misconduct.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Sworn in as Iran's President Amid Hostage Crisis</HEAD>

   Hashemi Rafsanjani was sworn in Thursday
as Iran's president and pledged to continue the 10-year-old Islamic
revolution. But he faced a crisis on his first day in office: the
threat of U.S. retaliation over hostages in Lebanon.
   At a ceremony in a mosque that was attached to the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's home in north Tehran, Rafsanjani's
voice shook with emotion as he promised to follow in the footsteps
of the revolutionary patriarch, who died June 3.
   ``Despite the propaganda coming from the arrogant world powers
our people will not accept anything but the continuation of this
path, which is the path of Islam and the Koran,'' he told religious
and government leaders a speech carried by Tehran radio.
   He did not mention the hostage issue.
   Rafsanjani, 54, a middle-ranking clergyman from a wealthy
pistachio-growing family in southern Iran, captured 94.5 percent of
the vote in the July 28 election to become the Islamic republic's
fifth head of state.
   He will wield considerably more power than his predecessors
under constitutional reforms approved by 97 percent of voters in a
referendum. The reforms abolish the post of prime minister,
currently held by Hussein Musavi, and allow the president to
appoint and fire Cabinet ministers.
   But Rafsanjani, said to be eager to improve ties with the West,
is being tested almost immediately by the hostage crisis.
   Lebanese terrorists, who claimed they hanged U.S. Marine Lt.
Col. William R. Higgins this week, threatened to execute another
American hostage, James Cicippio, if Israel does not release a
kidnapped Moslem cleric.
   President Bush said he is pursuing every possible diplomatic
channel to resolve the hostage crisis, while ``prudently planning''
for military action if Cicippio is killed.
   NBC quoted unidentified administration sources Wednesday as
saying Bush had made up his mind ``to strike back at the Lebanese
Shiites and their Iranian sponsors'' if a second hostage was killed.
   An administration official said a message to Iran, the existence
of which was disclosed Tuesday, had said in substance ``if anything
happens to the hostages we hold you responsible,'' and was conveyed
to Tehran through two channels: the Swiss embassy representing U.S.
interests there and through another government he declined to
identify. This official discussed the message on condition of
anonymity.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States was pleased with a statement Tuesday by Rafsanjani
condemning the killing of Higgins and all acts of terrorism. She
called on Rafsanjani to act in accordance with that statement.
   ``We remain convinced that Iran is in a position to bring
significant influence to bear on those who hold the hostages and
call on it to do so,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.
   The wildly popular Rafsanjani is believed to want to erase
Iran's image as a sponsor of international terrorism.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said in Tehran on Monday,
before Higgins was reported killed, that the threat against the
American ``has nothing to do with us'' but that Iran condemned such
action.
   On Sunday, however, Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi
warned that Islamic groups worldwide would strike at U.S. and
Israeli interests throughout the world in retalition for the
abduction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid by Israeli commandos July 28
in southern Lebanon.
   Despite his sweeping victory, Rafsanjani may have to proceed
carefully, particularly in dealing with the West, to avoid an open
break with Mohtashemi and other powerful radicals dedicated to
preserving the ideological purity of Khomeini's revolution.
   The Tehran Times said Thursday the West should follow the
example of the French, who ``succeeded in winning release of their
hostages in Beirut because they made an honorable deal.''
   All French hostages in Lebanon were released in 1987 but details
of the agreement were never made public. Rafsanjani has previously
linked using Iran's influence to free American hostages to release
of Iranian assets frozen by the United States.
   Rafsanjani took over from incumbent Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who
succeeded Khomeini as Iran's spiritual leader.
   He was swept into office amidst widespread anticipation that in
addition to trying to end Iran's international isolation he would
seek to liberalize Iranian life and revitalize the war-ravaged
economy.
   With his ready smile, sharp wit and fondness for cracking jokes
during his weekly Friday prayer broadcasts, the clean-shaven
Rafsanjani contrasts sharply with the grim-faced, bearded ruling
Islamic clerical hierarchy.
   He said at his inauguration that ``when I was preparing myself
for candidacy in the presidential elections, it never even entered
my mind that I would not receive my confirmation from the Imam's
hands.''
   The dignitaries wept at Rafsanjani's reference to Khomeini, whom
Iranians call their imam or supreme spiritual leader, said Tehran
radio, monitored in Cyprus.
   Although Khamenei, a longtime political ally of Rafsanjani, was
present at the ceremony, his inauguration message was read out by
Ahmad Khomeini, son of the late spiritual leader.
   The move appeared aimed at emphasizing consensus at the top of
the hierarchy, since Ahmad is considered a hardliner in the power
struggle between radicals and Rafsanjani's moderate faction.

<HEAD>Richardson Files $35 Million Suit for Being Jailed in Family Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fruit picker imprisoned more than 21 years
after the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children filed a $35
million lawsuit today for being wrongly convicted.
   Attorneys for 53-year-old James Richardson of Arcadia filed the
lawsuit in U.S. District Court.
   Richardson was freed last April after a state investigation
ordered by Gov. Bob Martinez found that suppressed evidence and
perjured testimony was used to convict him.
   Richardson stood trial only for the pesticide poisoning of his
oldest child and was sentenced to die in the electric chair. The
sentence was commuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court
struck down the death penalty in 1972.
   The lawsuit names the state of Florida, DeSoto County, former
State Attorney Frank Schaub and former DeSoto Sheriff Frank Cline.
   Roger Young, one of Richardson's attorneys in Sarasota, said it
was difficult placing a dollar amount on the time Richardson spent
in prison.
   ``It's hard. You can't really do it,'' Young said. ``He was
without his family, loss of liberty and everything that's
guaranteed to him by the constitution. Those things were all
stripped from him because of the actions of Frank Schaub.''
   Schaub, who retired in January, prosecuted the case in 1968 and
blasted special prosecutor Janet Reno for concluding that
Richardson probably was wrongfully accused. Ms. Reno announced in
May that the state would not retry Richardson, whose sentence was
vacated April 25.
   Efforts to reach Schaub and Cline by phone for comment were
unsuccessful.
   The suit seeks to compensate Richardson for mental anguish, loss
of the capacity for the enjoyment of life, loss of income, pain and
suffering and loss of his liberty and rights as a citizen of the
United States.
   Since his release from a state prison near Daytona Beach,
Richardson has worked at a diet clinic run by former comedian Dick
Gregory in Fort Walton Beach.

   The wife of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
met Wednesday in New York with U.N. Secretary General Perez de
Cuellar and received a supportive phone call from British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, a Pentagon spokeswoman said today.
   Robin Higgins traveled to the United Nations for her meeting
with the secretary general, who has dispatched envoy Marrack
Goulding to Lebanon to search for Higgins' body.
   A Shiite Moslem group claimed it killed Higgins on Monday in
retaliation for Israel's refusal to release a Shiite Moslem
clergyman it kidnapped last week.
   A Pentagon spokeswoman, Army Maj. Kathy Wood, said Mrs. Higgins
described the session with de Cuellar as ``private'' and relayed no
other information about it.
   Mrs. Thatcher telephoned Mrs. Higgins Wednesday morning, Ms.
Wood said.
   ``She just wanted Robin to know that she is in constant contact
with President Bush and that she will try to do anything, and if
they can, they will. She also said she admired Robin's strength and
courage in this crisis,'' Ms. Wood added.
   The spokeswoman described Mrs. Higgins as ``touched that the
prime minister would call her'' to express her concern.
   Mrs. Higgins, a Marine major, has been on leave for the past
several days from her job as a public affairs official in the
Defense Department's information office. She has refused
interviews, but comes daily to the Pentagon to be updated about her
husband's situation.

   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, who is
used to negotiating the bumps and curves of Belgian politics,
showed less skill along its country roads.
   Martens, bicycling near his holiday home in Oostduinkerke on the
Belgian coast, crashed Wednesday when he suddenly had to brake to
avoid an obstacle along the road. He broke a finger and bruised his
face.
   ``We were scared because the accident was pretty spectacular,
but it did not jeopardize his summer holidays,'' said a government
official.
   Martens, 53, took up cycling after a 1983 heart operation.
   He has been prime minister for most of the 1980s, leading
center-right as well as center-left governments, and has excelled
in seeking compromises to keep his coalitions together.
   He heads a five-party coalition of Dutch- and French-speaking
Christian Democrats and Socialists, and a Dutch-speaking
nationalist party.

   The city has imposed decibel limits on

   City council members voted 7-2 Tuesday that ice cream trucks
must keep their music below 55 decibels, a limit also applied to
such things as parties and dirt bikes. The jingles have registered
70 to 90 decibels.
   ``Without music, we're not going to get any business,'' said Ice
Cream Truck Inc. owner Joe Saurini, 52, who has three trucks
playing amplified jingles. The tunes ``have got to be so loud that
people can hear you at least a block away, so that people can get

   ``Citizens decided some time ago that (noise) is one of the
things we are going to regulate heavily,'' said city spokesman

   Fire swept through a crowded department

that some shoppers may have been killed.
   The fire broke out shortly before 8 p.m. on the fifth floor of
the 10-story Fit Today department store, and initial reports said
27 people were injured, police said.
   A firefighter was seriously burned and 26 shoppers were
hospitalized for smoke inhalation, they said.
   Firefighters smashed windows to rescue shoppers and movie goers
trapped by thick smoke from the blaze, which they said probably
started in a restaurant. They brought the blaze under control after
four hours.
   ``We fear many people have suffocated ... in the building,''
said Wang Hua-cheng, Taipei's police deputy chief.
   Many shoppers escaped to the roof to wait for rescue by
helicopters.

   President Bush lost one of his options
for a quick strike against Iran in the latest hostage crisis
because the logical fleet to execute it was 4,000 miles away, U.S.
military sources said Thursday.
   U.S. forces in the Mediterranean were within minutes' striking
distance of Lebanon, but the Navy carrier force based in the Indian
Ocean was making a routine port call in Singapore.
   ``The military option was there, but the Navy in the Indian
Ocean wasn't,'' said one of the sources, all of whom insisted on
anonymity.
   He described it as ``just the breaks'' that the USS America and
its eight-ship battle group were so far away when Shiite Moslem
kidnappers in Lebanon said Monday they had hanged Lt. Col. William
R. Higgins.
   Washington officials said immediately that ``all options'' were
open, including military response to the killing of the U.S. Marine
officer, who was on U.N. peacekeeping duty in south Lebanon when he
was abducted Feb. 17, 1988.
   That seemed to be reaffirmed Wednesday when Bush, asked about
movements of U.S. warships in the region, said his administration
was ``prudently planning'' the response to be made if a second
American was killed.
   U.S. diplomatic sources have said potential targets include Iran
because of its support for Lebanon's Shiite kidnappers of Higgins
and other Westerners.
   They likened the situation to April 1986, when President Reagan
used air strikes to punish Libya for its alleged sponsorship of
international terrorism.
   The officials in Washington confirmed the 79,000-ton America and
five of its escorts had cut the Singapore visit short, but would
not say where the ships were going or whether the move was linked
to the hostage crisis.
   Sources said the carrier was returning to its current duty of
patrolling the Arabian Sea as part of the Navy's Joint Task Force
Middle East, which covers that area and the Persian Gulf.
   Although the America could make the 4,000-mile voyage in about
five days at its top speed of more than 30 knots, that pace would
leave some of the escorts behind.
   Its battle group has the carrier's 80 aircraft and a variety of
cruise missiles on the Aegis cruiser Mobile Bay, missile cruiser
Dale, destroyers Comte de Grasse and Lawrence, and the frigate
Joseph Hewes.
   After a cease-fire was reached a year ago in the 8-year-old war
between Iran and Iraq, the Navy reduced its Persian Gulf force and
began giving more port time to sailors, who sometimes had spent
weeks at a time at sea on high alert.
   Carrier groups in the Arabian Sea are rotated every three
months, but since the truce, weeks sometimes pass with no carrier
on station.
   ``Almost anywhere you go out there, it's a matter of great
distance,'' one officer said. ``The Indian Ocean is not the
Mediterranean. There just aren't that many good liberty ports
around there.''
   The nearest regular port of call for U.S. carriers is Karachi,
Pakistan, about 500 miles from the gulf.
   They also visit Djibouti, a French base on the Horn of Africa,
1,500 miles away; the Seychelles Islands and Mombasa, Kenya, each
2,000 miles away, and Bombay, India, which is 800 miles from the
Strait of Hormuz at the gulf's southern end.
   Sources said the America sailed 2,500 miles to the Indian Ocean
base of Diego Garcia for weapons training before setting out for
Singapore.
   One said Iran offered ``limited choices'' in targets, the most
obvious being Kharg Island, the offshore oil terminal in the
northern Pesian Gulf that handles most of Iran's oil exports.
   Kharg was a regular, sometimes daily, target of Iraq air raids.
   The United States attacked Iranian oil platforms in the Persian
Gulf twice during the war in reprisal for Iranian attacks on
U.S.-flagged vessels.

   The CBS miniseries ``Lonesome
Dove'' dominated television nominations for Emmy Awards today,
closely followed by NBC's ``L.A. Law'' and the ABC miniseries ``War
and Remembrance.''
   ``Lonesome Dove,'' based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning Western
novel by Larry McMurtry, received 18 nominations, including best
miniseries and acting nods to Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Duvall, Diane
Lane, Anjelica Huston, Danny Glover and Glenne Headly. It also
received nominations for directing and writing.
   NBC's ``L.A. Law'' took 17 nominations as best drama series and
in eight acting categories, including real-life husband and wife
Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry, Susan Dey, Larry Drake, Jimmy
Smits, Richard Dysart, Michelle Greene, Susan Ruttan and Amanda
Plummer. The show also won two directing and three writing
nominations.
   Perhaps the biggest surprise was the omission of Roseanne Barr,
star of the ABC hit series ``Roseanne,'' in the comedy actress
category.
   The 30-hour miniseries ``War and Remembrance,'' based on Herman
Wouk's sweeping novel of World War II, won 15 nominations,
including best miniseries and lead acting awards for John Gielgud
and Jane Seymour and supporting honors for Polly Bergen. It also
was nominated for directing.
   Other major winners of nominations were ABC's ``The Wonder
Years'' with 14 nominations, ABC's ``thirtysomething'' with 13,
CBS' ``Murphy Brown'' with 11, NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' with 10
and Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' with 10.
   ``I've never been nominated for anything,'' said Joe Regalbuto,
who made the list for best supporting actor in a comedy series for
``Murphy Brown.'' ``I am really thrilled. It's what we call an
upper. But for the show to come up with 11 nominations, boy, that
is beyond imagination.''
   Betty White learned in a telephone call from The Associated
Press that all four stars of ``The Golden Girls'' were nominated
for a fourth time.
   ``You're kidding! Oh, God love it,'' Miss White said. ``You made
my day. This is marvelous. This is the big day as far as I'm
concerned.''
   The syndicated series ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and
CBS' ``Beauty and the Beast'' each got eight nominations.
   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences handed out 364
nominations. NBC received the most with 103, followed by CBS with
95 and ABC with 85. Other nominations: PBS 32, syndicated shows 21,
Fox 12, Home Box Office eight, Disney two and Lifetime, Turner
Broadcasting Systems, Turner Network Television and USA cable
networks with one each.
   The late Lucille Ball has been voted the academy's Governors
Award.
   Actor John Larroquette and actress Lynn Redgrave made the
announcements with academy president Doug Duitsman early this
morning.
   ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' was nominated as best comedy series
and its young star Fred Savage was nominated as best lead actor in
a comedy series. Robert Picardo was nominated as best guest actor
in a comedy series for his role as the gym instructor Mr. Cutlip
and Maxine Stuart was nominated as best guest actress as Mrs.
Carples. It also received three nominations for directing and four
for writing.
   ``Murphy Brown'' got the only other writing nomination.
   Other nominees for best miniseries were NBC's ``I Know My First
Name is Steven,'' PBS' ``A Perfect Spy'' and ABC's ``The Women of
Brewster Place.''
   CBS' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ABC's ``China Beach,'' ABC's
``thirtysomething'' and CBS' ``Wiseguy'' were nominees as best
drama series along with ``L.A Law.''
   Comedy series nominees along with ``The Wonder Years'' were
NBC's ``Cheers,'' CBS' ``Designing Women,'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls'' and CBS's ``Murphy Brown.''
   Selected to compete for the best drama or comedy special were
ABC's ``David,'' CBS' ``Day One,'' HBO's ``Murderers Among Us: The
Simon Wiesenthal Story,'' ABC's ``My Name is Bill W.'' and NBC's
``Roe vs. Wade.''
   Nominated as best lead actor in a comedy series along with
Savage were Ted Danson for NBC's ``Cheers,'' Richard Mulligan for
NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' Michael J. Fox for NBC's ``Family Ties'' and
John Goodman for ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   Lead comedy actress nominees were Blair Brown for Lifetime's
``The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' Candice Bergen for CBS'
``Murphy Brown,'' and Betty White, Beatrice Arthur and Rue
McClanahan, all of NBC's ``The Golden Girls.''
   Ron Perlman was nominated as best lead actor in drama series for
CBS' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' along with Edward Woodward of CBS'
``The Equalizer,'' Carroll O'Connor for NBC's ``In the Heat of the
Night,'' Ken Wahl for CBS' ``Wiseguy'' and Michael Tucker for
``L.A. Law.''
   Perlman's co-star in ``Beauty and the Beast,'' Linda Hamilton,
was nominated as best lead actress in a drama series as were Dana
Delany in ABC's ``China Beach,'' Angela Lansbury in CBS' ``Murder,
She Wrote'' and Susan Dey and Jill Eikenberry in ``L.A. Law.''

   The 41st annual Emmy Awards will be broadcast live Sept. 17 by
Fox Broadcasting. John Moffitt and Pat Tourk Lee will produce the
show from Pasadena.
   Awards in the creative crafts will be handed out in a
untelevised ceremony Sept. 16.
   This year a rules change requires performers to enter their own
names before they could appear on a nomination ballot.
   Selections of the winners will be made Aug. 26-27 by panels in
which actors select actors, directors select directors, writers
select writers and so on.
   Original cable programming will compete in the competition for
the second time. Earlier this year, the Television Academy and the
National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences voted to allow cable
shows to compete in the daytime Emmy awards.
   Last year, only three awards went to cable shows. The cable
industry has continued its own ACE awards program.

<HEAD>U.N. Says Elections on Track despite Problems</HEAD>

   Racist laws and charges of police
harassment and detentions of dissidents by guerrillas won't delay
Namibia's independence, the chief U.N. official for the territory
said Thursday.
   ``I am reasonably confident that we are three months away from
holding an election,'' U.N. Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari
of Finland told a conference on the future of the South
African-ruled colony.
   ``Barring any unexpected major setback we should have elections
Nov. 6,'' said Ahtisaari.
   Sixty percent of the estimated 650,000 eligible voters have
registered, he said.
   U.N. police are having difficulty monitoring territorial police
on patrol in northern Namibia because land mine-resistant vehicles
the police leased them have broken down, Ahtisaari said.
   Nevertheless, he said, the U.N. police presence is having a
``reassuring and calming effect'' on people in the north, where
police are accused of harassing supporters of the guerrilla-backed
South-West Africa People's Organization.
   The organization ended its 23-year bush war for independence
when Pretoria signed a U.S.-brokered accord agreeing to grant
Namibia independence in exchange for the withdrawal of Cuban troops
in Angola.
   Ahtisaari said the integration into the police force of about
2,000 members of a paramilitary unit called ``Koevoet'' _ Afrikaans
for crowbar _ is unacceptable.
   ``There is no place for the continuance of a counterinsurgency
operation,'' Ahtisaari said. ``They should be fulfilling normal
police operations only.''
   Police retraining Koevoet men report only 15 percent are
literate and others would be unable to take down a citizen's
complaint or crime report, Ahtisaari said. ``Their skills must lie
elsewhere,'' he said.
   The South African administrator of Namibia, Louis Pienaar,
defended the presence of Koevoet during the one-day conference,
organized by the University of Pretoria. He said Koevet members are
needed to counteract any possible invasion by armed guerrillas who
remain across the border in Angola.
   Ahtisaari said he continues to investigate charges by prisoners
released by the guerrilla organization that up to 2,000 more
detainees are being held in neighboring countries where guerrillas
have refused to allow U.N. or Red Cross officials to inspect their
camps. About 200 detainees freed last month were accused of spying
for South Africa.
   ``I am not yet satisfied that all political prisoners have been
released and I am pursuing this with all concerned governments and
with SWAPO,'' Ahtisaari said.
   He said he also is continuing discussions with Pienaar about
repealing legislation that divides Namibia into 11 ethnic
governments providing schools and medical services on a racial
basis.
   ``This legislation is found by the majority of people, including
all the major political parties, to be repugnant,'' said Ahtisaari.
Pienaar wants to leave it to a new government, expected to take
office early next year.
   He also said he is ``not content with the impartiality of the
state-controlled media'' and will suggest proposals to rectify the
situation.

   Flames neared California's Palomar Observatory and threatened a
nature sanctuary today as firefighters elsewhere in the West
struggled to consolidate gains made against hundreds of wildfires
with the help of cooler weather.
   An estimated 220,000 acres of timber, brush and grassland have
burned throughout the West in a bout of fires that began July 26,
according to the federal Boise (Idaho) Interagency Fire Center.
More than 20,000 firefighters were on the lines in Idaho, Oregon,
Washington, Montana and California.
   Cool, moist air slowed the spread of fires in Idaho and Oregon,
but a warming trend was predicted this afternoon and through the
weekend.
   ``Things haven't slowed down at all here,'' said spokesman Kris
Long at the federal fire center. ``With supplies and manpower
coming in and out, it stays busy.''
   In Southern California, firefighters dropped water and chemicals
and set fires of their own in a struggle to keep flames from a
10,300-acre wildfire away from the Eagle Crag nature sanctuary in
the Cleveland National Forest today. The fire was within 5 miles of
the Palomar Observatory, a mountaintop astronomy center operated by
the California Institute of Technology.
   Crews had cut lines around 60 percent of the blaze early today,
but their chances of containing the flames would be hurt if fire
got into the Eagle Crag area, about 90 miles southeast of Los
Angeles, said Forest Service spokeswoman Audrey Hagen.
   ``No equipment is allowed in the area,'' Ms. Hagen said.
Bulldozers might be authorized as a last resort, but the terrain is
so steep they probably wouldn't be able to get in, she said.
   In Idaho, a break in dry lightning that zapped the state in
recent weeks was enough to prompt stepped-up efforts to hack
containment lines around the worst of the fires burning 90,000
acres of timber and range.
   An estimated $36 million in resources have been destroyed in the
Boise National Forest alone, officials said.
   Cooler, moister air eased the immediate danger to two small
backcountry towns in west-central Idaho, which most residents
evacuated earlier in the week.
   Strategists called for at least 70 more 20-member crews to join
more than 6,200 firefighters already committed in Idaho. Hundreds
of Idaho National Guardsmen also were activated to support the
effort.
   In the forests, the first priority continued to be protection of
small communities and pockets of summer homes and cabins.
   Soapy white foam was sprayed on structures, and hundreds of
firefighters were diverted from frontal assaults on the blazes to
clear brush and other fuel from around private property.
   Besides the war on the ground, dozens of helicopters were
ferrying buckets filled with water from rivers to hot spots, and
air tankers have been dropping about a quarter-million gallons of
chemical retardant a day.
   The situation Wednesday elsewhere in the West:
   _ In eastern Oregon, teams worked to prevent erosion in the
Malheur and Wallowa-Whitman National Forests even before the fires
that had claimed 88,000 acres of timber and range lands were
contained. Several smaller blazes were contained, and the spread of
the bigger fires around the towns of John Day, Baker and Enterprise
had stopped, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Wendy Evans in
Portland.
   _ In California, in addition to the Cleveland National Forest
blaze, a 3,000-acre fire burned out of control in the Sierra Nevada
foothills in the center of the state, but didn't pose a threat to
structures.
   _ In Montana, fire engines stood by to protect two mountain
cabins as a lightning-sparked fire in in dead timber grew quickly
to 500 acres on the Crow Indian Reservation southeast of Billings.
An 800-acre grass and timber fire in the Custer National Forest in
the state's southeastern corner was contained.
   _ In Washington, firefighters were mopping up the 850-acre
Lodgepole fire in the North Cascades near the Canadian border.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader: Interrogation Didn't Link Him to Trip</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said
Thursday a 22-hour interrogation by security agents failed to
implicate him in a secret trip to communist North Korea by a
lawmaker charged with espionage.
   Kim told a news conference at the headquarters of his Party for
Peace and Democracy that he was cleared of any suspicion and
charged that his questioning by security authorities was a
well-conceived government plan to undermine his party's image.
   But the Agency for National Security Planning, the main
government intelligence organization, said that since questioning
was legally limited to 24 hours and Kim issued ``adamant denials,''
they ran out of time and that Kim might be questioned again.
   ``They detained me for questioning without any evidence,'' Kim
told supporters after returning from the interrogation that lasted
until early Thursday.
   The head of the largest opposition party said investigators
could not present evidence that he had any part in a trip to North
Korea last year by National Assemblyman Suh Kyung-won.
   Suh was expelled from Kim's party after the lawmaker was
arrested June 28.
   South Korea bans unauthorized travel to North Korea and
maintains that dialogue or contacts must go through official
channels. Violators can be sentenced to prison terms under tough
national security laws.
   Kim and senior party lawmaker Moon Tong-hwan were interrogated
after being detained on a court warrant Wednesday.
   Government officials said Kim was investigated to determine
whether he funded a trip to North Korea a year ago by Suh, whether
Kim sent a message to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, and how Suh
became involved in party politics.
   Suh is jailed on charges of security violations and espionage
and accepting $120,000 from communist agents. Nine people also were
arrested in the case.
   Kim, who has run twice for president, has denied any involvement
in Suh's trip. He accused the government of political harassment
aimed at disgracing his party.
   ``I rebutted point-by-point all points of suspicion raised by
the NSP (Agency for National Security Planning),'' Kim said. ``I
deplore our political atmosphere in which the head of the largest
opposition party was detained without sufficient grounds.''
   Kim said he had no prior knowledge of Suh's trip and so could
not have sent a message to the north. The opposition leader
admitted he had given Suh $1,000 but it was customary for him to
give some money to party members making overseas trips.

   A twin-engine airplane crashed on takeoff at
the Albany airport, killing all six people aboard as it cartwheeled
down the runway and burst into flames.
   Witnesses said the plane lost an engine Wednesday afternoon
after barely getting aloft. It dipped to the right, breaking a wing
and spewing fuel.
   In Florida, a single-engine plane crashed in the front yard of a
home shortly after takeoff, killing the two people aboard,
officials said.
   Both planes were based at a Sarasota, Fla., airport.
   The bodies of the six people in the Georgia crash were removed
from the wreckage Wednesday night and taken to two Albany hospitals
for identification, said Mike Armour, manager of the Southwest
Georgia Regional Airport.
   The plane was based at Dolphin Aviation of Sarasota, and owned
by D.L. Porter Construction of Sarasota, a commercial contractor,
said Ron Ciaravella, president of Dolphin Aviation.
   Porter Construction identified the dead as Donald Porter, 45, of
Sarasota, president of the firm; Steven Loer, 26, of Sarasota, a
Porter Construction vice president; Ernie Zimmerman of Port
Charlotte, Fla., a retired educator from the Cleveland, Ohio, area
who was a friend of Porter's; John Gianitsis, a company pilot from
Sarasota; Jamie Suarez, 22, a Florida International University
student working at Porter for the summer; and Nelson J. Miller, 28,
of Sarasota, a company construction superintendent.
   Ciaravella said the plane left Sarasota 7:30 a.m. Wednesday for
Savannah and flew on to Albany en route to Akron, Ohio.
   Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the
National Transportation Safety Board were to begin an investigation
today.
   The propeller-driven aircraft had climbed only about 10 feet off
the ground at the Southwest Georgia Regional Airport when its right
engine caught fire, witnesses said.
   Witnesses reported that the plane's right wing then slammed into
the ground, spilling fuel as the aircraft cartwheeled several times.
   The plane, engulfed in flames, came to rest upside down and
broken apart in a grassy area near the control tower.
   The fire prevented any rescue, witnesses said. ``There's not
much you can do when that gas ignited,'' said off-duty Eastern
Airlines pilot Doug Powell, a witness to the crash.
   In the Florida crash, a plane took off from Sarasota-Bradenton
Airport on the Gulf Coast just before 2 p.m., but the pilot made
two distress calls a short time later, said Manatee County
sheriff's spokesman Dave Bristow.
   The pilot, whose craft apparently developed engine trouble,
tried to return to the airport, but crashed in the front yard of a
Bradenton home about a mile northwest of the airport, Bristow said.
   Ciaravella said tomato grower James Croley and pilot Alan
DeLoach were flying to Stuart, Fla., to meet with a prospective
buyer of the 1972 Beechcraft 824-R at the time of the crash.

<HEAD>Zimbabwe Says it Won't Seize White-Owned Farms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Robert Mugabe's government
said Thursday it is under pressure to hand over white-owned land to
peasant farmers, but promised it won't seize private farms.
   ``I want to assure you the government is not a grabber,'' Rural
Development Minister Joshua Nkomo told a meeting of the
4,000-member Commercial Farmers' Union in Harare.
   But Nkomo said the state will push ahead to redress continuing
imbalances in land ownership in this Southern African nation of 9.2
million people.
   About 4,000 mainly white commercial farmers own one-third of
land in Zimbabwe, a country slightly smaller than California. Eight
million peasants occupy roughly the same amount of land as white
farmers.
   Land hunger was a key issue of the seven-year bush war that
ended when the white-ruled former British colony of Rhodesia became
independent Zimbabwe in 1980.
   But since then, only a few hundred white farmers have sold their
properties to the state for peasant resettlement programs funded by
Britain and the United States. The deals were made under a
``willing seller-willing buyer'' clause in Zimbabwe's first
constitution which expires next April, 10 years after independence.
   ``In the coming year, when this provision ceases to be
effective, government will not grab land from anybody,'' Nkomo told
about 200 white farmers at their annual convention.
   But, he said, ``The government has been under pressure. The
people have been saying: `We believed that after independence
things would change, yet we still sit here in exactly the same
manner as before.'''
   Mugabe's government says it is socialist but encourages a mixed
economy to flourish.
   Nkomo said the government plans a ``socio-economic evaluation''
of commercial and peasant farming to find ways of releasing more
land to peasants.
   He urged white farmers to ``sit together as citizens of this
country and address this problem.''
   Zimbabwe's agriculture-based economy produces $1 billion worth
of crops a year, including $500 million in foreign currency from
tobacco, cotton and other exports. It is one of the few African
nations that produces enough to feed itself and export food.
   Commercial farmers say they are the nation's largest single
employer, supporting a workforce of 380,000 people and 1.5 million
of their dependents.
   Since independence, 52,000 peasant families averaging six family
members have been resettled on about 1.2 million acres.
   About 1 million acres, 16 percent of total white-owned
farmlands, were bought by the state. The rest was former state land
turned over to resettlement.

<TEXT>
   Sinhalese radicals shot and killed 18
people in southern areas, including nine relatives of a government
lawmaker, officials said Thursday.
   In New Delhi, Indian and Sri Lankan officials held talks for a
sixth day Thursday on a timetable for withdrawing an estimated
45,000 Indian troops from the Indian Ocean island nation, an Indian
government spokesman said.
   The troops were sent more than two years ago to enforce a plan
aimed at ending the fight by Tamil rebels for autonomy in the north
and east. Radicals of the Sinhalese majority have attacked the
government, claiming it has given too many concessions to the Tamil
minority.
   The nine relatives of lawmaker P.D. Abeyaratna were shot and
killed Wednesday at Kalutara town, 25 miles south of Colombo, said
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Abeyaratna was not at home when the attack occurred.
   The other victims included four workers of a government cement
factory, a physician and his assistant and two unidentified
civilians. The deaths occurred in the southern province.
   Police in the area Thursday found the body of a man who was shot
to death.
   In Colombo, another group of radicals dressed in police uniforms
raided a government armory Wednesday and escaped with 25 automatic
rifles after a heavy exchange of fire, police said. At least five
government security men were wounded.
   Minutes before the raid, bombs exploded in three other areas of
the capital in what police said were diversionary tactics by the
radicals. One civilian was injured in the explosions, police said.
   The government offered limited autonomy to Tamil-majority areas
in July 1987 in a bid to appease Tamil rebels fighting for an
independent nation since 1983.
   At least 4,000 people, mainly government officials, have been
killed in the two-year Sinhalese uprising. The Tamil insurgency has
claimed another 11,000 lives.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and the
Sinhalese make up 75 percent. Tamils accuse the Sinhalese of
discriminating against them in jobs, education and use of the
Sinhalese language.

<HEAD>FHA Fraud in Oklahoma ``Probably Largest in the Country''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   To appreciate the immense potential for
housing fraud in depressed Oklahoma, one needed only to look at the
numbers: At one point last year, the state had 1,459 foreclosed FHA
homes while New York City had 39 and Boston had one.
   Potential turned into reality, and now Oklahoma has ``probably
the largest FHA fraud in the country,'' says Charles Ming, area
manager for the federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which includes FHA.
   Some estimates of the Federal Housing Administration fraud have
approached $1 billion. A special team of federal investigators has
been poring over records and mortgage documents for months, and
already more than 20 people have either been convicted, pleaded
guilty or agreed to do so.
   The possible scope of the situation in Oklahoma was spelled out
by Ming, who estimated that fraud may have tainted up to two-thirds
of the 5,600 FHA loan defaults over the past 2{ years. Some
promoters were raking in illicit cash from 100 homes each, he said.
   Oklahoma's oil-related economic straits provided a calamitous
backdrop for illegal schemes. Thousands of homes stand vacant;
hundreds more are on the market with no buyers in sight. Along with
the high-rollers who made hundreds of thousands of dollars, the
lure of a few extra dollars also sucked in such people as a retired
policeman and an Air Force mechanic.
   Ming and Troy Grigsby, HUD deputy field office manager,
described three basic forms of fraud:
   _Submitting false documents to the FHA in order to obtain
mortgage insurance. Grigsby said this involved setting someone up
as a ``straw man'' purchaser of a house, often with money provided
by the investor. Generally, this ``straw man'' was an average
person looking to make easy money, officials said.
   _Kiting a property's value through sham sales. Grigsby said the
fraud came when someone would purchase a property, then ``sell'' it
to a friend at several times its value. ``Then using appraisals
based on the higher sale figure, they would get an FHA loan,'' he
said.
   _Equity skimming, where someone supposedly assumes a mortgage,
rents out the property but never makes any mortgage payments. ``The
lender never realized anything was wrong until the mortgage went
into foreclosure,'' Grigsby said.
   Ming said homeowners faced with crushing payments were all too
ready to bite when someone offered perhaps $1,000 and an agreement
to take over his mortgage, never realizing that the ``buyer'' had
no intention of making any mortgage payments, he said.
   Dozens of surprised renters have been forced to move when the
home on which they paid monthly rent was foreclosed. Even more
surprised was the original owner, who found himself liable for the
defaulted mortgage.
   An unusual twist was uncovered during the winter when
investigators found unsuspecting families living in foreclosed and
supposedly vacant homes. In each case, someone had removed the
locks placed by real estate agents and, posing as the owners, had
rented out the houses.
   Acting U.S. Attorney Robert E. Mydans says 13 people have been
convicted in connection with one scheme or another. Five others
have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing and four more have
agreed to plea bargains but have not yet entered their pleas,
Mydans said.
   A federal court jury earlier this year convicted a real estate
investor, a minister and an Air Force civilian employee of making
false statements and using phony documents to obtain FHA-insured
loans in 31 transactions totaling more than $800,000. All ended in
default.
   Cecil R. Johnson was a typical illegal investor.
   The government alleged that in a standard deal, Johnson would
purchase a run-down property, have it appraised at a highly
inflated ``refurbished'' value, and then obtain a conventional loan
based on that higher value.
   He would use only a small part of the loan money to repair the
house while pocketing the rest, then get someone to buy the home
with an FHA-insured loan, the government said.
   One of the straw men set up by Johnson was Robert McKittrick, a
retired Oklahoma City police officer, who admitted receiving $4,000
for participating in several deals. He was placed on probation,
fined $50 and ordered to repay HUD the $4,000.
   Lloyde Billman, a retired meat salesman, testified in court that
he was almost broke and trying to care for an ailing wife when he
became involved with Johnson. Only when Johnson placed $14,000 in
his bank account was he able to qualify for an FHA loan, Billman
said. He was put on probation, fined $50 and ordered to repay
$2,400 to HUD.
   Johnson was sentenced to four years in prison, fined $3,540 and
ordered to repay $150,000 to HUD.
   FHA fraud isn't the only part of the burgeoning scandals at HUD
to touch on Oklahoma City.
   A HUD audit has linked Philip Winn, now ambassador to
Switzerland, and two other former HUD officials to a group alleged
to have made millions of dollars in ``unjustified profits'' on
multi-family rehabilitation projects, including one here.
   Winn, who served as an assistant secretary for housing for a
year, was partners with Philip Abrams, former HUD undersecretary,
and J. Michael Queenan, former director of HUD's regional office in
Denver.
   Jack G. Womack, executive director of the Oklahoma City Housing
Authority, said he had informed HUD that rent on a two-bedroom
apartment in the Oklahoma City project should have been about $250.
Instead, he said, the Winn group and Benton Mortgage Co., a
Nashville-based company that has been suspended from government
work, insisted it should be $357.
   After debt service for rehabilitation work was added to the
$357, the rent for a two-bedroom apartment came to $479, Womack
said. Since the typical renter will pay only $100 to $150, the
federal government has to pick up the rest, he said.

   Lebanon's U.N. ambassador said Thursday it
will build a monument to U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins
and 164 other U.N. peacekeepers who have died in Lebanon.
   ``Lt. Col. Higgins would be very prominent in the memorial,''
Ambassador Chawki Choueri told The Associated Press. ``He was one
of the commanders and lost his life for the peacekeeping force.''
   Choueri said the monument would honor Higgins and 164
peacekeepers who have died in service with the U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon, called UNIFIL.
   Higgins was commanding an observer group of the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization attached to UNIFIL when he was kidnapped
Feb. 17, 1988, by a pro-Iranian Shiite group, the Organization of
the Oppressed on Earth.
   They accused Higgins of spying for the CIA, and announced Monday
he had been hanged because Israel refused to release a Shiite
cleric it had abducted on Friday.
   A competition for the design of the monument will be announced
soon and consideration will be given to a site, most likely in
southern Lebanon where the peacekeepers have been trying to enforce
a truce zone, Choueri said.
   In addition to Higgins, six members of the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization have died since its founding in 1948, five
of them in accidents or in action.
   U.N. officials say 125 of the UNIFIL casualties died in action
or in accidents, and the rest died of other causes.
   Four Irish members of the 5,854-strong UNIFIL force died in two
separate attacks in the last six months. Machine-gun fire from a
Christian militia killed one man, and three died when their truck
hit a mine.
   The nations contributing to the force are Fiji, Finland, France,
Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and Sweden. UNIFIL is
commanded by Lt. Gen. Lars-Eric Wahlgren of Sweden.

   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
telephoned the wife of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins and
lauded her for ``strength and courage,'' a Pentagon spokeswoman
said Thursday.
   Mrs. Thatcher called Robin Higgins Wednesday morning, said Maj.
Kathy Wood, an Army spokeswoman.
   ``She just wanted Robin to know that she is in constant contact
with President Bush and that if there is anything they can do, they
will. She also said she admired Robin's strength and courage in
this crisis,'' Ms. Wood added.
   The spokeswoman described Mrs. Higgins as ``touched that the
prime minister would call her'' to express her concern.
   A Shiite Moslem group claimed it killed Higgins on Monday
because of Israel's refusal to release a Shiite Moslem clergyman it
kidnapped last week.
   Higgins, of Lexington, Ky., was part of a United Nations
observer force in Lebanon when he was kidnapped in February 1988.
His captors, the Organization of the Oppressed on Earth, accused
him of being a spy and said in July 1988 that he had been sentenced
to death.
   Ms. Wood said Mrs. Higgins also went to New York Wednesday
evening to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Mrs. Higgins described the session with the U.N. official as
private and relayed no other information about it, Ms. Wood said.
   The U.N. official has dispatched envoy Marrack Goulding to
Lebanon to search for Higgins' body.
   Mrs. Higgins, a Marine major, has been on leave from her job as
a public affairs official in the Defense Department's information
office for the past several days. She has refused interviews and
comes daily to the Pentagon to be updated about her husband's
situation.

   Steven Spielberg, movie director and
Eagle Scout, said he came to the 12th National Scout Jamboree to
return a debt he owed to Scouting.
   ``Scouting helped me with leadership. It taught me how to speak
out,'' the director of such movies as ``Jaws'' and ``E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial'' said Wednesday during the first day of the
jamboree.
   Scouting ``built my self-confidence,'' Spielberg told about 400
Scouts chosen as hometown news correspondents. ``I took out of
Scouting, then I never put back in. Here's my turn to put back in.
That's why I'm here.''
   The 41-year-old Spielberg, who started making movies as a Scout
to get his photography merit badge, was given the Distinguished
Eagle Scout award Wednesday night for his work in films and his
involvement in Scouting. He also introduced a new cinematography
merit badge.
   ``I think the proudest moment of my entire life was when I
became an Eagle Scout,'' Spielberg told a crowd of about 70,000
Scouts, leaders and visitors who gathered for the evening ceremony
in an outdoor amphitheater. ``I have never been as proud as I am
right now to be an American in this country.''

   Anatoly Gromyko, the son of Andrei Gromyko,
the late Soviet foreign minister, says the United States must
support social, economic and political changes occurring in his
homeland.
   ``One of the dangers we face more often than not is to adhere to
old stereotypes in social, economic and political behavior,''
Gromyko told an audience of about 250 on Wednesday. The forum was
sponsored by Town Hall, a 51-year-old non-profit, non-partisan
organization that provides topical speakers.
   ``Trade barriers between the U.S. and Soviet Union should
ease,'' Gromyko said in fluent English. ``With the help of Los
Angeles area business leaders, we can have normal trade relations.
We see a positive trend beginning in Los Angeles already.''
   Gromyko answered questions from a diverse audience including
high school students, civic leaders and former California Gov.
Edmund G. ``Pat'' Brown.
   The younger Gromyko is director of the Institute for African
Studies at the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   His father died July 2 at age 79. He served as the Soviet
Union's foreign minister under five Kremlin leaders.

   David Hahn, a 49-year-old driver from Aurora, Colo., beat eight

   The customized vehicle features a constant temperature, an
oversized shower, an abundance of telephones and electronic

   The five singing Osmond brothers are
targets of a federal lawsuit alleging they failed to pay nearly
$150,000 owed on a 1980 loan from the now-defunct Utah Firstbank.
   A second suit, also filed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
in U.S. District Court on Wednesday, charged that brothers Merrill
and Wayne Osmond and a Salt Lake City man, Joseph S. Gasser Jr.,
also owe more than $38,000 on a loan made in 1985 from the same
bank.
   The FDIC, suing as the receiver of Firstbank's assets after it
closed, is suing for recovery of the larger amount from Osmond
brothers Donald, Jay, Alan, Merrill and Wayne, and from Gasser and
the two partnerships under which the government agency says the
loans were taken out.
   Telephone calls to Merrill Osmond's office Thursday for comment
were unsuccessful because of repeated busy signals on the line.
   ``Although payment (on the larger loan) has been demanded, only
one payment, in the amount of $35,000, has been paid,'' claims the
suit filed concerning the 1980 loan.
   The second complaint states that ``neither the whole or any
part'' of the smaller loan had been paid.

   Mister Rogers, the public television institution
who has been entertaining children for more than 30 years, is often
the butt of comedians' jokes, but he says it's only because they
like him so much.
   ``Mr. (Johnny) Carson has done quite a few of those, and I asked
him why,'' Fred Rogers told Parade magazine in its upcoming Sunday
issue. ``He said, `We wouldn't do those if we didn't have such
great affection for you.'''
   ``Eddie Murphy does a parody, too. I was at NBC one day, and he
came down the hall, threw his arms around me and said, `Ah, the
real Mister Rogers!'''
   Rogers, 61, whose ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' has been
broadcast in various versions since the early 1960s, is an ordained
Presbyterian minister from Pennsylvania. He has written several
books _ on everything from potty-training to how to help children
handle divorce.
   Asked if he had any regrets about how he raised his two grown
sons, Rogers said: ``Neglect isn't just beating kids. It's ignoring
them. We didn't ignore the boys, but I'd like to have spent more
time with them.''
   Rogers says he has met shy children but never one who rejected
him.
   ``I never force myself. I just get out Daniel Striped Tiger (a
hand puppet) and slide him under my arm _ he's shy too _ and I
start talking to them.''

   Indictments of 46 commodities traders represent
only the opening salvo in the government's crackdown on corruption
at the world's two largest futures exchanges, according to the
prosecutor.
   ``This is an ongoing investigation, not a concluded
investigation,'' U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas told reporters
Wednesday.
   ``This is the first step in what we will be doing,'' he said,
adding the investigation ``will continue as long as there are
viable allegations of misconduct.''
   After a 2{-year undercover FBI investigation, 46 traders at the
Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange were accused
of systematically conspiring to skim profits from customer accounts
and attempting to hide earnings from the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``This probe is part of an expanding Department of Justice
crackdown on white-collar crime in all its various guises, from
Wall Street to (Chicago's) LaSalle Street to Main Street with all
stops in between,'' said U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who
came to Chicago to announce the indictments.
   ``The activities uncovered at these exchanges, the largest of
their type in the world, cannot be tolerated.''
   The four separate indictments, covering 1,275 pages and hundreds
of counts, allege that brokers trading for their own accounts as
well as customers' accounts systematically and illegally cheated
customers with the cooperation of ``locals'' _ traders trading only
for their own accounts.
   Responding to a possible crisis of confidence, the Mercantile
Exchange announced early today it had approved several rule changes
and increased surveillance to better protect customers.
   The most significant change will not go into effect without
membership approval, however. It would restrict dual trading, in
which a trader is allowed to trade his own account as well as those
of customers.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc's executive committee, said
the exchange hoped ``to put the fear of God'' into traders through
increased scrutiny and stiffer penalties, including automatic
expulsion of any trader found guilty of a second offense involving
a customer's account.
   The changes resulted from a comprehensive review of the exchange
conducted by a blue-ribbon panel appointed in January, when the FBI
probe was revealed.
   Eighteen of the defendants were charged with violating the
federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act, which
carries the stiffest penalties, up to 20 years in prison. These
charges also empower the government to freeze defendants' assets
before trial for seizure upon conviction.
   Most of those indicted are charged with multiple counts such as
pre-arranged trading, racketeering conspiracy and income tax fraud
in schemes that allegedly bilked hundreds of customers out of
profits in thousands of trades, said Valukas.
   He wouldn't say how much money customers may have lost to the
alleged fraud but called the amount ``significant.''
   Fourteen of those charged have agreed to plead guilty and
cooperate with investigators, according to government sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Some futures traders and defense lawyers characterized most of
those indicted as small-time players and guessed that the
government was using them to net bigger prey.
   ``These appear to be small fish who extended the rules and
regulations at times that Big Brother was watching,'' said one
trader who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Attorney Thomas Royce, representing indicted Japanese yen
futures trader Gary Wright, said he expects the investigation to
widen.
   `The government doesn't spend millions _ as they did here _ and
bring in the attorney general and the FBI director if they're only
seeking 46 guys,'' he said.
   Thornburgh, FBI Director William Sessions and Wendy Gramm,
chairman of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission, flew
into Chicago for the news conference.
   Ms. Gramm called the indictments the ``first results of the most
extensive and aggressive law enforcement effort in the financial
area, ever.''
   Four undercover FBI agents secretly tape-recorded, observed and
even participated on exchange floors in the illegal transactions,
the indictments say.
   Futures are contracts to buy or sell by a future date at a
specified price commodities and financial instruments such as
soybeans, pork bellies, Treasury bonds and baskets of stocks.
   The charges involve trading in the Swiss franc and Japanese yen
currency futures pits at the Chicago Merc and in the U.S. Treasury

   The exchanges were not accused of wrongdoing and neither were
any of the scores of brokerage firms whose customers were allegedly
cheated.
   Valukas said both exchanges ``when called upon provided full

   So to help me move I demand from the American people, oblige
Israel to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid immediately because his

<HEAD>Possible Cracks Seen At Bottom Of Unit 2 Reactor Vessel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Engineers at Three Mile Island, site of
the nation's worst commercial nuclear plant accident, are studying
what could be two small cracks on the inside of the damaged
reactor, a spokeswoman said Thursday.
   It is not yet known if the small lines that showed up on a
remote television inspection of the reactor bottom are indeed
cracks, said plant spokeswoman Mary Wells. They could be scales or
rivulets of molten material left over from the March 1979 accident,
she said.
   ``We don't know the significance,'' Ms. Wells said, adding that
a team of six engineers has been set up to study the situation.
   The possible cracks were discovered by a team of experts
studying the Unit 2 reactor, which has been shut since the accident
and is being cleaned and readied for long-term closure. There are
no plans to restart the reactor.
   The bottom of the carbon steel reactor vessel is 5 inches thick
at the point the possible cracks were found and is covered on the
inside by a steel liner one-eighth inch thick.
   There has been no indication of any leaks through the bottom of
the reactor vessel, Ms. Wells said.
   Half of the 150-ton radioactive core at TMI-2 collapsed and
melted in the accident, when a series of mechanical failures and
operator errors blocked vital cooling water. Radioactive gases were
released.
   The possible cracks were found in early July at the base of two
of 52 nozzles where instruments once protruded into the core, at a
spot where temperatures were the hottest during the accident. One
of the lines is at the point where a nozzle is welded to the liner,
the other appears to extend from the weld to the liner itself.
   Many of the nozzles were covered with molten debris that flowed
to the reactor's bottom. Most of that debris was removed within the
past month, giving technicians their first good view of the reactor
bottom since the accident.
   Technicians have done remote television inspection of all but
five of the nozzles, but also want to take another look at 10
because of some visibility problems, Ms. Wells said.
   In mid-August, probing tools and, for the first time, a color
television camera will be lowered into the vessel to give the study
team a better idea of whether the lines are cracks.
   One theory is that small cracks could have occurred because the
stainless steel contracts at a different rate than the underlying
carbon steel, said spokesman Doug Bedell. The possible cracks are
on or near welds holding the nozzle bases to the vessel, he said.
   Bedell said any conclusions on whether the cracks _ should they
prove to be cracks _ meant the situation at TMI a decade ago was
worse than previously thoughtwould have to await completion of a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission study. In the study, set to begin
later this year, samples of the steel will be taken and studied.
   About 275,000 pounds, or 92 percent, of the debris, remaining
fuel and other metal components have been removed from the reactor
vessel.
   By the end of next year, the plant operator, GPU Nuclear Corp.,
plans to put the plant in long-term, monitored storage. The plan is
awaiting approval by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

<HEAD>Administration's Senate Bill Has Little Democratic Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's clean air bill was introduced
in the Senate Thursday with just three Democratic co-sponsors, and
an administration official blamed Majority Leader George J.
Mitchell for the lack of bipartisanship.
   The three Democrats joined 21 Republican sponsors after the
administration conducted a vigorous recruitment drive among
Democrats.
   A source at the Environmental Protection Agency, speaking only
on the condition he not be named, said agency Administrator William
Reilly became so upset with Democratic attacks on the bill that he
called Mitchell to complain.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, the chief sponsor of past clean air
legislation, which failed to pass, said July 25 that the Bush bill
``avoided virtually every tough choice'' in forcing cities and
industries to clean the nation's skies.
   Bush has made the legislation a top priority, agreeing with
environmentalists on the urgent need to clear the skies of smog,
toxic chemicals and acid rain. But his decision to leave much
discretion to the EPA administrator, and in some cases to industry,
caused environmental groups and their supporters to call the bill
too weak to protect the nation's health.
   Patrick Quinn, the EPA's congressional liaison, called the
paucity of Senate Democratic sponsors ``a reflection of unexpected
partisan tactics by the majority leader's office. We made the same
kind of effort (to line up sponsors) as we did in the House,''
where 57 Democrats and 90 Republicans backed the legislation.
``It's a rather shocking disparity. Reilly feels that's very
unfortunate and wants to avoid any partisanship in the debate.''
   The EPA source said Reilly, in his call to Mitchell, made a
similar point, stressing he ``does not want to get off to a
partisan start in the clean air debate. Mitchell said he had real
concerns about (administration proposals) on ozone and toxic
(chemicals) and auto emissions.''
   Sen. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, ranking Republican on the
Senate Environment Committee, was the chief sponsor of the
administration legislation.
   The Democrats who joined him were Donald W. Riegle Jr. of
Michigan, John B. Breaux of Louisiana and J. James Exon of Nebraska.
   Chafee noted the lack of Democratic support indirectly, saying,
``The introduction of the president's bill is not the end of the
process, but a major advance in the march.''
   ``After eight years of silence from the White House on this
issue, we now have a chief executive who recognizes the need for a
major overhaul of the Clean Air Act,'' Chafee said.

<HEAD>Nursing Homes Said to `Warehouse' Elderly With Mental Illnesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mentally ill nursing home residents often are
improperly drugged and denied adequate care because government
policies discourage treatment and trained aides are in short
supply, experts told a House committee Thursday.
   Janet Pacatte of the National Mental Health Association said
insufficient federal funds and the lack of adequately trained staff
``contribute to warehousing hundreds of thousands of elderly
Americans who suffer from a mental illness.''
   ``There is a substantial unmet need for mental health services
for the nursing home population,'' she told the House Select
Committee on Aging.
   Several mental health experts testified that mental disorders
affect from 50 percent to more than 90 percent of the nation's 1.5
million nursing home residents, with nursing home populations
likely to increase rapidly as the population ages.
   Mental illnesses frequently are undiagnosed or mistreated at
nursing homes because Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement policies
are biased in favor of the treatment of physical ailments, they
said.
   Dr. Barry Fogel of the American Psychiatric Association said
nursing homes shy away from diagnosing mental illness because they
could be reclassified as mental institutions and ruled ineligible
for Medicaid payments if too many of their patients are being
treated for such problems.
   In addition, Fogel said, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement
rates for psychiatric services in nursing homes are inadequate to
attract enough psychiatrists, and nursing home staffs often lack
training for these problems.
   ``The consequence is the treatment of mental and behavioral
symptoms with psychotropic (mind-altering) drugs alone, rather than
with a comprehensive and holistic approach,'' Fogel said.
   Ms. Pacatte cited the experience of her own mother as a case of
overmedication.
   ``I cannot begin to share with the dismay and horror I felt when
I visited my mother in a nursing home and found her in a
drug-related stuper, hallucinating and completely out of touch
because she was on inappropriate use of psychotropic drugs,'' she
said.
   Ms. Pacatte called for changes to ``radically alter the
deplorable situation now found in so many nursing homes where staff
are untrained, lack professional support and residents go without
essential mental health treatment and are often inappropriately
restrained.''
   Dr. Michael A. Smyer, professor of human development at
Pennsylvania State University, said more federal dollars should be
earmarked for training geriatric specialists. He also called for
removing the barriers to mental health treatment that are built
into the Medicaid and Medicare programs.
   C. Ross Anthony, associate administrator for program development
at the Health Care Financing Administration, conceded that Medicaid
and Medicare are ``heavily weighted'' toward acute medical care
rather than mental health services.
   But he added: ``The Medicare and Medicaid programs now provide
more and better ways to finance medically necessary services for
the mentally ill than ever before.''
   Committee Chairman Rep. Edward Roybal, D-Calif., has introduced
legislation to shift more Medicaid and Medicare dollars toward
mental health services in nursing homes and to target $30 million
in community mental health money for the elderly.
   ``For far too long, mental health care has been a neglected
priority in our American health care system,'' Roybal said.

<HEAD>Soviets Agree to Early Chemical Weapons Inspections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has accepted U.S. demands that
the superpowers begin inspecting each other's chemical weapons
sites before a global ban on the weapons is signed, officials said
Thursday.
   Moscow's shift was conveyed in a memorandum from Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to Secretary of State James A. Baker
III when they met in Paris last week.
   The United States had been demanding that the inspections begin
before a global ban is signed by the 40-nation Geneva Conference on
Disarmament.
   Moscow previously wanted to allow checks only after the treaty
was completed and signed.
   The Geneva disarmament conference has been debating a
comprehensive convention to ban chemical weapons for more than two
decades, but delegates have little hope of getting the draft accord
ready in the immediate future.
   A Soviet delegate to the Geneva talks said Moscow's change of
position was aimed at starting the inspections as soon as possible.
   Moscow expects on-site checks to back its official position that
it has no more than 50,000 tons of chemical armaments. Some Western
analysts have said the Soviet stockpile is more than six times
bigger than that.
   The Paris meeting, at which the Soviets' decision was relayed,
was part of separate superpower talks on chemical weapons.
   The United States and Soviet Union, which have the world's
biggest poison gas arsenals, say these talks could help the Geneva
negotiations.
   Disputes include how to monitor compliance with a ban on the
weapons.
   When the latest round of bilateral talks ended in June, the
superpowers reported agreement on technical procedures for
inspections. But officials said further negotiations were needed on
exchanging chemical weapons data, a step that would precede the
inspections.
   The Geneva talks are to continue in the fall.
   The Soviet delegate in Geneva said he could not give firm
predictions about when data exchanges or inspections may begin.
   A U.S. arms control official, while confirming the Soviet shift,
said, ``There's a lot that remains to be resolved on the details.''
   Also Thursday, both superpowers indicated the latest round of
talks on reducing long-range nuclear forces had made some progress
but disagreements on major issues remain.
   Chief U.S. envoy Richard Burt expressed hope the ``useful and
constructive'' round paved the way for a ``productive discussion''
on the draft Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty when Baker and
Shevardnadze meet next month in the United States.
   Soviet chief delegate Yuri Nazarkin reiterated that Moscow views
U.S. plans for space-based missile defenses as the main obstacle to
a START accord, which would reduce each side's arsenal of
long-range missiles and heavy bombers by up to half.
   Referring to a Bush administration proposal for testing
anti-cheating measures before a treaty is completed, Nazarkin said
the Soviets will ``carefully analyze all of its aspects.''
   ``Generally speaking, the idea of test running verification
methods appears quite useful,'' he said.

   The Senate approved legislation Thursday that
would give Vietnam-era veterans disability benefits for certain
illnesses associated with U.S. use of Agent Orange.
   The bill provides payments on an interim basis, through April
15, 1992, while providing for subsequent congressional votes to
make the benefits permanent. Benefits would be paid to veterans
with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and soft-tissue sarcoma.
   A broader version is pending in the House.
   Passage of the Senate bill by voice vote was a victory for
veterans advocates, who have been battling government scientists.
They have accused various agencies of ignoring evidence about the
deadly herbicide while government scientists have said that no
clear cause-and-effect relationship has been established.
   ``It has been a long, hard struggle,'' said Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., a co-sponsor of the bill and chairman of the Veterans
Affairs Committee. ``Too many Vietnam veterans and their families
have suffered anguish for far too long.''
   ``This bill is important ... obviously because it creates a
presumption in favor of veterans,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
a Vietnam veteran. He said the measure makes it clear that ``there
will not be an adversariness in the attempt by veterans to seek the
services that they are entitled to. ... It does not open up a
Pandora's box of benefits because these are two very rare
diseases.''
   The bill was discussed on the Senate floor late Wednesday and
passed with little difficulty Thursday morning.
   An estimated 2.6 million military personnel were in South
Vietnam during the war in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Some
250,000 have told the Veterans Administration, now the Department
of Veterans Affairs, that they believe they were exposed, and
35,000 have applied for disability benefits.
   Veterans already are allowed to receive outpatient and hospital
care for illnesses presumed to be linked to Agent Orange.
   Approximately 12 million gallons of the herbicide were sprayed
during the Vietnam War to remove the foliage providing ground cover
for the enemy. Agent Orange contains dioxin, one of the most toxic
chemicals known, as well as 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D, also harmful
chemicals.
   The bill in the House would allow veterans to be compensated
longer, and for more diseases. Under it, veterans with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, melanoma and basal
cell carcinoma would be eligible for permanent disability benefits.
So would their survivors.
   The House bill has been estimated to cost $40 million. No such
estimate was available for the Senate version, although it would be
considerably less.
   The Senate bill establishes _ for the first time _ a presumption
of service connection for any Vietnam veteran with chloracne, a
skin condition, provided it occurred within a year of the time the
person's service tour ended.
   Both bills require extensive record-keeping by the Veterans
Administration based on health reports and tissue samples from
veterans. Both would ask the National Academy of Sciences to review
scientific studies on Agent Orange exposure every two years, with
the Department of Veterans Affairs making its benefits
determinations based on those reviews.
   The Senate passed an Agent Orange bill last year but the measure
never emerged from the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.
   Rep. G.V. ``Sonny'' Montgomery, D-Miss., chairman of that
committee, and the senior minority member, Rep. Bob Stump, R-Ariz.,
sent colleagues a letter last month calling the House bill
``premature at best.''
   They cited a continuing study by the Centers for Disease Control
on the incidence of selected cancers among Vietnam-era veterans,
due for completion next spring, and noted a federal court order to
change the criteria used to evaluate Agent Orange studies and the
recent creation of a U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals to review
claims.
   But supporters of the bill said the CDC and VA had moved too
slowly to determine whether a link exists between Agent Orange and
the various afflictions.
   During a House Government Operations subcommittee hearing in
early July, the CDC was accused of rigging its Agent Orange study
to show no direct link. Officials of the health agency maintained
that it dropped a massive study of Agent Orange exposure because
there was no way to tell who was exposed.

   Palestinians told a U.S. envoy Thursday there
has been an ``alarming lack of progress'' in the U.S.-PLO dialogue,
and urged the United States to change what they called its
pro-Israel stance.
   Also Thursday, 17 people were wounded by plastic bullets when
Israeli troops opened fire on the main street of Khan Yunis in the
occupied Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   The troops fired after their patrol was hit by a hand grenade,
injuring three soldiers and three Palestinians, the army and Arab
reports said.
   The clashes came as the Supreme Court in Jerusalem ruled that
the army's regulations on the use of plastic bullets were legal and
denied a request that the bullets be banned or put under stricter
limits.
   Thirteen prominent Palestinians from the occupied lands met with
John Kelly, assistant secretary of state for Middle East affairs,
who is on the first leg of a tour that will include Egypt and
Jordan.
   The Palestinians said in a statement that they considered the
session ``to be part of the ongoing U.S.-PLO dialogue'' which was
launched in Tunis last December after PLO chief Yasser Arafat
renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   They said that dialogue ``has so far demonstrated an alarming
lack of progress in matters of substance and the levels of
representation.''
   Earlier, Kelly met for an hour with Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir. Kelly told reporters after the meeting that they discussed
the peace process, but declined to give details.
   Avi Pazner, Shamir's spokesman, did not say if the meeting
touched on the Israeli abduction of Lebanese Shiite leader Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid on July 28. The abduction led to the apparent
execution of a U.S. hostage, U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins, by his Lebanese captors.
   Higgins' killing was to be high on the agenda at the fifth
congress of the Fatah movement, the main component of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, which opened Thursday in Tunis.
   PLO spokesman Ahmed Abdel-Rahman said the incident was to be
discussed as part of the congress' consideration of Lebanon, which
has been wracked by a 14-year-old civil war.
   Fatah on Tuesday condemned the killing of Higgins but put the
blame on Israel.
   In his opening speech at the congress, Arafat said the PLO
disliked the original Israeli plan for elections in the occupied
territories, but would have accepted it if it had been a step
toward Palestinian self-determination.
   The Israeli plan aimed at ``perpetuating the Israeli occupation
of the occupied territories'' and has now collapsed in failure,
Arafat said.
   Shamir has called for elections in the West Bank and Gaza,
occupied by Israel since 1967, to select Palestinians to open talks
with Israel on an interim autonomy agreement. The plan also calls
for Arab countries to make peace with Israel.
   Radwan Abu Ayyash, head of the Arab Journalists Association in
east Jerusalem, said the Palestinians told Kelly ``nothing could
happen here'' without approval of the PLO, and that Israel must be
convinced to accept the U.S.-backed concept of trading land for
peace.
   He said Kelly, in turn, warned that while the United States
would assist in the peace process, it was up to the two sides to
offer acceptable proposals.
   ``We are not going to deliver you to Israel, neither are we
going to deliver Israel to you. There is a table of negotiations,
and you have to make your own way to this table and you have to
learn how to live together,'' Abu Ayyash quoted Kelly as saying.
   In their statement, the Palestinians noted the United States had
endorsed Israel's plan for elections in the occupied lands but not
the PLO plan, which says the elections should lead to creation of a
Palestinian state.
   ``We view with the greatest seriousness the lack of
even-handedness and objectivity in the U.S. response,'' the
statement said.

<HEAD>Judge Gives Commerce Secretary Until Monday To Protect Sea Turtles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today said Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher had no right to suspended enforcement of
regulations to protect endangered sea turtles from drowning in
shrimpers' nets and gave the agency until Monday to draft interim
measures.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan said he would consider
making the Commerce Department enforce regulations requiring
shrimpers to equip their boats with turtle excluder devices, or
TEDs, if the agency does not submit a plan to protect the sea
turtles by Monday's deadline.
   Hogan's decision followed a two-hour hearing on the National
Wildlife Federation's request for an injunction that would require
the department to enforce requirements that shrimpers use TEDs.
   Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the TEDs regulations July 24,
after angry shrimpers, who contend the devices reduce their catch
by as much as one-third, blockaded shipping channels along the
Texas Gulf Coast and threatened violence against law officers and
the Coast Guard.
   Hogan said that while he is concerned about the shrimpers'
livelihood, he said it is regrettable that shrimpers in other areas
have learned to use TEDs but that Texas and Louisiana shrimpers
``cannot find it possible'' to use the devices even for a season.
   The TEDs regulations were to take effect May 1, after 17 years
of debate within Congress and the courts, but Mosbacher limited
enforcement of the rules to warnings until July 1.
   Later in the month, Mosbacher said he had no alternative but to
enforce the TEDs regulations, prompting the July 22-23 protests.
   Mosbacher has now proposed new regulations requiring shrimpers
to pull their nets every 105 minutes to keep endangered sea turtles
from drowning, but they have not taken effect.
   Hogan said Mosbacher's decision to suspend enforcement of the
TEDs rules until the tow regulations take effect was a ``total
abrogation'' of the law to protect sea turtles and appears to ``fly
in the face'' of a congressional mandate.
   ``His actions on July 24 leave them totally unprotected,'' Hogan
said. ``They have been totally abandoned by the secretary.''
   Wildlife attorney Jan Goldman-Carter testified the shrimping
season in Texas and Louisiana is at its peak, so the turtles are at
maximum risk of being killed in their nets.
   She said ``we are so close to the edge (of extinction) on the
Kemp's ridley'' sea turtle.
   Government attorney Michelle Kurac said Mosbacher's decision to
suspend the TEDs regulations was justified, given the protests and
the shrimpers' vows not to comply with the rules.

<HEAD>ABA Committee Supports Court on Flag-Burning Issue</HEAD>

   An American Bar Association committee that
includes former Nixon and Carter administration officials urged
Congress on Thursday to abandon efforts to outlaw desecration of
the American flag.
   The committee said the nation's commitment to freedom of
expression will be damaged by any attempt to reverse a Supreme
Court ruling that Americans have a right to burn the flag as a
political protest.
   ``All through human history, tyrannies have tried to enforce
obedience by prohibiting disrespect for the symbols of their
power,'' the task force said. ``The American flag commands respect
and love because of our country's adherence to its values and its
promise of freedom, not because of fiat and criminal law.''
   Headed by former Internal Renenue Service Commissioner Randolph
Thrower, an appointee of former President Nixon, the panel will ask
the ABA's policy-making House of Delegates to endorse its report
next week during a convention of the lawyers group in Honolulu.
   The committee said that because Congress appears to be rushing
toward some action, the ABA should go on record now opposing either
legislation or a constitutional amendment to reverse the court
ruling.
   Lawyers have ``a special obligation to defend the Constitution
and its cardinal principles,'' the task force said.
   ``We agree that the burning of the American flag as a form of
political protest is very offensive to the vast majority of our
citizens,'' the panel said. But, ``it is just when people take
great offense because of disrespect shown to an honored symbol that
the right of free expression needs protection, not prosecution.''
   The Bush administration and leading Republicans in Congress
support a constitutional amendment that would permit states to
outlaw flag desecration. Democratic leaders in Congress are
sponsoring legislation to make flag desecration a crime.
   The Senate Judiciary Committee is conducting hearings on the
proposals and the House could vote on one or more of the measures
after it returns in September from its August recess.
   The high court on June 21 ruled that Texas improperly prosecuted
a man who burned the flag at a protest during the Republican
National Convention in Dallas in 1984. The ruling apparently
invalidated flag desecration laws of 48 states and the federal
government.
   Other members of the ABA task force are Barbara Black, dean of
Columbia University Law School; Warren Christopher, deputy
secretary of state under former President Carter; Erwin Griswold,
former dean of Harvard Law School and solicitor general in the
Nixon administration; Prof. Gerald Gunther of Stanford University
Law School; Robert McKay, former dean of New York Univrsity Law
School; Earl Silbert, a U.S. attorney appointed by Nixon and Cyrus
Vance, former secretary of state under Carter.
   In a separate development, Griswold and Norman Dorsen, president
of the American Civil Liberties Union, announced the formation of a
20-member committee opposed to the amendment. Charles Fried, a
professor of law at Harvard who was solicitor general in the Reagan
administration, is co-chairman with them.
   ``The First Amendment embodies this nation's strong commitment
to free expression,'' the committee said in a statement. ``It has
stood for nearly 200 years as a guardian against government
censorship or limitation of vigorous public debate. We disagree
with any effort to restrict the First Amendment by constitutional
amendment.''
   Griswold said at a news conference that he is also opposed to
efforts to overturn the court's decision by adopting a statute,
because he does not believe one could be enacted that would
withstand consttitutional challenges in court.
   Other members of the committee, called the Emergency Committee
to Defend the First Amendment, include Derek Bok, president of
Harvard University; Benjamin Civiletti, attorney general in the
Carter administration; William T. Coleman Jr., secretary of
transportation in the Nixon administration; Lloyd N. Cutler, White
House counsel in the Carter administration; Hanna H. Gray,
president of the University of Chicago, and Benno Schmidt Jr.,
president of Yale University.

   Relief flooded over the family of
American hostage Joseph Cicippio this afternoon as word came that
an execution order already given two reprieves had been suspended
by his kidnappers in Lebanon.
   ``This gives them much more time to get together and get this
thing worked out,'' said Thomas Cicippio, brother of the hostage,
outside his home where family members had gathered when the
execution order was announced.
   ``This is what we were looking forward to,'' Thomas Cicippio
said. ``Of course, we are all very happy.''
   The suspension of the execution came after a four-hour reprieve
was granted this morning, following a 48-hour reprieve on Tuesday.
   ``This means that perhaps there is something in the making _
maybe to our liking _ and they need a little more time to resolve
whatever is going on,'' Thomas Cicippio said when the four-hour
reprieve was announced.
   The Cicippio family then went to nearby Holy Savior Catholic
Church, where hourly masses were held today for all the hostages as
the fate of the Pennsylvania native remained in the balance.
   Thomas Cicippio expressed hope that Iran and its new president,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, were behind the reprieves.
   ``I have a lot of faith in Rafsanjani,'' Thomas Cicippio said.
``I fully believe that Rafsanjani and Iran holds the key to the
hostage issue.''
   He said he believes Rafsanjani understands resolution of the
crisis could improve relations between Iran and other countries.
   When the family first heard audio tapes of the hostage's
recorded plea with Israel to release a Moslem cleric it holds, the
hostage's son, David, 27, couldn't believe it was Cicippio. But
when the video was added and the tape replayed on television, he
was convinced.
   ``It's the first time I've heard his voice in three years. I
can't explain how I feel right now,'' said David Cicippio.
   Both son and brother said it was obvious Cicippio was reading
from a prepared text.
   Thomas Cicippio has been keeping track of the captivity of all
American hostages on signs in his front yard.
   On Wednesday night, he walked across his rain-soaked lawn,
ignoring the clattering cameras of the media, and silently added
another day.
   The totals: Edward Tracy, 1,018; Tom Sutherland, 1,517; U.S.
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins, 534; Joseph Cicippio, 1,057;
Robert Pohill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner, 923; Terry Anderson,
1,602; and Frank Reed, 1,060.
   Back inside the Cicippio home, he spoke of the strain the family
has faced as they await news of Joseph Cicippio, whose captors, the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, had threatened to kill him at
11 a.m. EDT today.
   His kidnappers extended the deadline today to 3 p.m. EDT after
Joseph Cicippio appealed for the immediate release of a Shiite
Moslem cleric held in Israel.
   Cicippio's appeal and the announcement of the reprieve were made
in a videotape released to a Western news agency in Beirut by the
Revolutionary Justice Organization.
   The death threat _ orginally set for Tuesday _ is in retaliation
for Israel's refusal to free Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite
Moslem religious leader kidnapped by Israeli commandos last week.
   ``It's been hectic,'' Thomas Cicippio said late Wednesday. But
today ``will be the most hectic day of all.''
   Family members had come and gone, leaving Cicippio alone with
his wife, Frances, and Joseph Cicippio's Lebanese brother-in-law,
Sami Ghandour, 23, in the family den.
   After watching the television news, which featured them, they
talked about how Joseph Cicippio, 58, left his home in this
Philadelphia suburb to work abroad, how he met his Lebanese wife,
Elham, and how much he loved his work as acting comptroller at the
American University of Beirut.
   He was kidnapped from the campus Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``Joe never really felt he was in too much danger. He always
felt safe in that he worked at the American University of Beirut.
He just enjoyed being there,'' Thomas Cicippio said.

   The kidnappers of American hostage Joseph
Cicippio said today they had suspended his death sentence but
demanded that Israel free a Shiite Moslem clergyman and Palestinian
and Lebanese prisoners it holds.
   The announcement was delivered 45 minutes before the 10 p.m. (3
p.m. EDT) deadline set for Cicippio's death. It was the second
message today from the Revolutionary Justice Organization. Earlier,
it released a statement announcing Cicippio's death sentence had
been put off from 6 p.m. (11 a.m. EDT) to 10 p.m.
   The latest statement was delivered to a Western news agency in
Beirut, along with an instant photograph of Cicippio, looking into
the camera with the trace of a smile on his face.
   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states
with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, we
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution
with an initiative,'' said the 14-line Arabic statement.
   It demanded that Israel release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped Friday by Israeli commandos, as well
as Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held in Israel. Lists of
them are to be prepared later and presented to the Red Cross, it
said.
   Previously, the group had only demanded freedom for Obeid and
two companions seized with him.
   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise the
initiative will be considered canceled,'' said the handwritten
message. It did not say if the death sentence would then be
restored.
   Earlier today, Israel said it would not free Obeid until Israeli
soldiers and foreigners held in Lebanon are freed.
   That was in response to the earlier Revolutionary Justice
message, which included a videotape on which Cicippio reading a
statement appealing for freedom for Obeid.
   The group has put off the death order three times since Tuesday.
   Earlier today, the White House said President Bush had not
decided whether to take military action if Cicippio was killed.
   U.S. warships were reported moving toward the Mediterranean, but
the Pentagon said today the moves were nothing unusual.
   A Shiite Moslem leader threatened a ``ruthless'' reprisal in the
event of a U.S. attack.
   U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding was in Lebanon searching for the
body of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins. Goulding told
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' that some people told him Higgins
may still be alive.
   A Shiite Moslem group claimed it killed Higgins on Monday to
avenge Israel's refusal to release Obeid.
   ``I appeal to each person having honor who can move to release
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid ... Don't be late, because they (the
captors) are very serious,'' said the statement Cicippio on the
videotape released earlier today.
   Cicippio, with a bushy beard, was shown from the waist up. He
was wearing eyeglasses and a blue track suit and looked haggard and
distressed. The statement's poor English suggested his captors
wrote it.
   ``So to help me move, I demand from the American people, oblige
Israel to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid immediately because his
kidnapping is not human,'' Cicippio said, reading slowly.
   ``We the American people are always the victims of Israel's
politics, and President Bush has not helped to free us.''
   Cicippio, choked with emotion, ended the statement with a
message for his Lebanese wife, Elham.
   ``Goodbye, my wife. If you don't hear my voice and see my face
again I want you to look after yourself and don't be sad and always
remember me.''
   The kidnappers' handwritten statement accompanying the video
said in Arabic: ``In response to Cicippio's request to delay the
execution until 10 p.m., in the hope that his appeal would be
fruitful and useful, it has been decided to grant a delay in the
new deadline.''
   A Shiite source noted that Revolutionary Justice has threatened
to kill hostages in the past but is not known to have carried out
the threats.
   Israel has offered to trade Obeid for three Israeli soldiers and
foreign hostages in Lebanon. The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, of which
Obeid is reputed to be a member, rejected a swap.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for factions holding
most of the 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon. The captives include
eight Americans.
   Yossi Ben Aharon, a senior aide to Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir, today said Israel was not changing its policy on
Obeid. ``We took this gentleman for purpose of release of our three
prisoners, and this remains the objective,'' he said.
   Cicippio, 58, of Norristown, Pa., was acting comptroller of the
American University of Beirut when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986.
   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Earlier today, U.N. envoy Marrack Goulding held a closed-door
session in Beirut with Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
Hezbollah's spiritual guide.
   In south Beirut, where most of the hostages are believed held,
Sheik Abbas Mousawi, a senior Hezbollah leader, said his group's
response would be ``ruthless'' if the United States took military
action.
   ``President Bush must think a million times before embarking on
such a reckless adventure. I don't think he has forgotten the
truck-bombing of the American marine base at Beirut airport,''
Mousawi said, referring to the 1983 attack that killed 241 U.S.
servicemen at a military base in Lebanon.
   Pentagon officials said the USS Belknap, flagship of the U.S.
6th Fleet, and the fleet commander canceled a visit to the Soviet
city of Sevastopol in case Bush needs them, but that a military
strike was unlikely. The aircraft carrier America cut short a visit
to Singapore and headed to the Mediterranean.
   Goulding, interviewed by telephone by ABC, said he had met two
Shiite leaders and the charge d'affairs of the Iranian Embassy
today.
   ``Some of them have told me that Col. Higgins is probably dead,
others have said to me they think he may still be alive. And I pray
to God the latter group is right,'' he said.
   ``Let me make clear that my mission is not confined to Col.
Higgins only,'' he added. `` But I'm also here to say whether the
U.N. can do anything to get under control the hostage crisis.''

   A federal judge ruled Thursday that four 6th
century mosaics purchased by a suburban Indianapolis art dealer are
the property of the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus.
   U.S. District Judge James E. Noland said in his ruling that Peg
Goldberg never obtained good title to the mosaics and has no right
to possess them.
   The two plaintiffs, the Republic of Cyprus and the Autocephalous
Greek-Orthodox Church of Cyprus, ``have made a proper showing in
all respects for the return of the mosaics,'' Noland said.
   Noland ruled that under the circumstances of the case, Ms.
Goldberg must return the mosaics but will not have to pay any
monetary damages.
   Ms. Goldberg purchased the mosaics in July 1988 after learning
of them in a trip to Amsterdam and viewing them in a Swiss airport.
   She said she had no immediate comment on the ruling but would
issue a statement later in the day.
   The seller was Aydin Dikman, a Turk living in Germany who
claimed he was a former archaeologist for the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus. Court records show he has been linked to several
art thefts from Cyprus.

   A new study indicates a drug called deprenyl
delays serious symptoms of Parkinson's disease and allows patients
to work and function twice as long as people not taking it.
   In a study to be published Friday in the journal Science, Dr. J.
William Langston of the California Parkinson's Foundation reported
that patients with early symptoms of Parkinson's who were treated
with deprenyl postponed progression of the neurological disease for
an average of almost eight months.
   ``It seemed to slow the rate (of symptom progression) by about
half and doubled the time before they needed treatment,'' Langston
said in a telephone interview. If the findings are verified by
later studies, he said, ``it suggests that we are tapping into the
basic mechanism'' that causes Parkinson's.
   Parkinson's is a brain disease marked by a progressive loss of
brain cells. The symptoms include palsy, a shuffling gait, a fixed
expression with unblinking eyes and, sometimes, emotional
instability. It affects about one person in 50, and strikes
patients most frequently in their 50s and 60s.
   The cause of the disease, which affects about 500,000 Americans,
is unknown and it is not curable.
   Progression of Parkinson's can be slowed with a drug called
levodopa, or L-dopa, but this drug can have serious side effects
and it loses its effectiveness over time.
   Langston said his study was conducted to determine if deprenyl
could slow the progress of the disease and thus give patients more
time before they were forced to start taking L-dopa.
   The study involved 54 patients, all of whom were evaluated by
tests to be at approximately the same early stage of Parkinson's.
Half of the patients were treated with deprenyl and half with a
placebo, or sugar pill.
   On average, those patients receiving the placebo required L-dopa
therapy within 312 days. But those taking deprenyl did not require
L-dopa for an average of 548 days.
   This means, said Langston, that serious symptoms of the disease
_ as evaluated by five different assessment methods _ were delayed
for more than 33 weeks on average.
   ``Overall, there was about a 50 percent decline in the rate of
progression,'' said the researcher. He said this translates into
maintaining a quality of life that could allow patients to work and
function longer.
   Dr. Erwin Montgomery, a professor of neurology at Washington
University in St. Louis who treats Parkinson's patients, said the
study is ``of very major significance.''
   ``Reducing the onset of symptoms has a tremendous effect,'' he
said. ``This translates into people being employed longer. This can
have a great importance in their lives.''
   The precise effect of deprenyl on brain tissue cannot be
determined without an autopsy, Langston said, but if later studies
show that the drug can actually protect brain cells that usually
die in Parkinson's then the findings may be a step toward finding a
cure.
   ``If we have altered the course of cell death in Parkinson's and
slowed it down, it suggests that we are tapping into the basic
mechanism that is causing those cells to die,'' said Langston.
``That's a very exciting clue of the possible cause.''
   Deprenyl, manufactured by Bolar Pharmaceuticals Co. of Copiague,
N.Y., is approved for use with L-dopa, but Langston said he used
the drug alone as a clinical trail approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. The drug will be sold starting in September under
the brand name Eldepryl.
   Langston's co-author in the study was Dr. James W. Tetrud, also
of the California Parkinson's Foundation. Science, which published
the study, is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

   Israel said Thursday it will hold a kidnapped
Shiite Moslem cleric until Israeli soldiers are traded for him,
despite threats to American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``We still stick to our position that we are ready to exchange
kidnap victims and hostages,'' Yossi Ahimeir, spokesman for Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, told The Associated Press.
   ``Our goal is to rescue, save our people in Lebanon in the hands
of several organizations there. Of course, we are ready to make
exchanges of hostages.''
   Israel has offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid and other
Lebanese Shiite prisoners for three soldiers held in Lebanon and
the Western hostages, who include eight Americans.
   Commandos abducted Obeid from his home in south Lebanon on July
28. Israel says he planned guerrilla raids and directed the
kidnapping of Lt. Co. William R. Higgins, a U.S. Marine serving
with U.N peacekeepers, in February 1988.
   Higgins' captors said they hanged him Monday in retaliation for
the abduction of Obeid, a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, the
pro-Iranian group believed to be behind the kidnapings.
   Several hours later, another group of kidnappers said they would
kill American hostage Joseph Cicippio, 58, unless Obeid was
released. After two extensions of the deadline, the death threat to
Cicippio was suspended on Thursday in connection with several new
demands on Israel.
   The kidnappers demanded the release of Obeid, as well as
Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held in Israel. The group said
it would provide a list of names of all the captives it wants
released to the Red Cross.
   Ahimeir reported ``all kinds of consultations'' within the
government about the hostage crisis.
   Yossi Ben Aharon, a top aide to Shamir, said Israel was in
``constant touch'' with the U.S. government, but he would not say
whether Shamir had talked by telephone with President Bush.
   The Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassadors of West Germany,
Italy and Britain, whose citizens are among the hostages in
Lebanon, and also the Japanese envoy.
   Israel radio said the Japanese ambassador was called in because
Japan was involved in contacts with Iran. The radio gave no details
and ministry officials could not be reached for comment.
   Italian Ambassador Alberto Leoncini Bartoli, asked later whether
his government was in touch with Iran, replied: ``No. I only know
that through the diplomatic channels there have been initiatives.''
   He said other countries in the region were involved in these
contacts, but ``to the best of my knowledge'' there has been no
response.
   ``My government has made approaches through diplomatic channels
to Iran, among other countries in the region. To my knowledge there
has been no response to these approaches yet.''
   Aharon said Israel would not change its position on Obeid.
   ``We took this gentleman for the purpose of releasing of our
three prisoners, and this remains the objective,'' he said.
   Higgins' captors released a poor-quality videotape of a man who
appeared to be the Marine colonel hanging from a gallows. There was
no way of telling when the tape was made, conflicting reports have
arisen about when he was killed.
   A Defense Ministry statement said Obeid told interrogators he
believed Higgins was alive last week, but quoted him as saying his
evidence was hearsay.
   The statement said Israel continued to believe Higgins was
killed late last year. Officials said they might give Obeid to a
lie-detector test to determine what he knew about the American
officer.

<HEAD>Drop in Leading Indicators Revives Recession Talk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday that its chief
economic forecasting gauge declined in June for the fourth time in
five months, renewing concerns that the longest economic expansion
in peacetime history may be nearing an end.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
edged down 0.1 percent in June following a May decline of 1.3
percent, which had been the steepest drop in 19 months.
   The leading index still has not flashed the traditional signal
of an impending recession, which is three consecutive monthly
declines. Decreases in February, March, May and June were broken up
by a 0.6 percent rise in April.
   But many economists cautioned that the three-straight rule is
not infallible. The steep 1981-82 recession had actually begun
before the index recorded its third consecutive decline.
   Some analysts said they believed the economy is headed for a
downturn, based on the weakness already shown in the leading index
and various other business barometers.
   ``We are flirting with a mild recession,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. He predicted that economic growth
would decline for two consecutive quarters beginning in the first
three months of 1990.
   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said he
believed the 6{-year expansion has already ended and economic
output will be contracting in both the current July-September
quarter and the final quarter of this year.
   But David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, said the
country should be able to skate by a period of very sluggish growth
without an actual downturn although he cautioned, ``It's time to
cross your fingers.''
   At the White House, the administration remained optimistic of
reaching its target for overall economic growth of 2.9 percent this
year, as measured by the GNP, although officials said growth would
be lower than in 1987 and 1988.
   ``The weakness in the leading indicators over recent months is
consistent with our view that economic growth is likely to remain
relatively soft over the second half of 1989,'' said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   The GNP, the country's total output of goods and services, grew
at a lackluster annual rate of 1.7 percent in the just-completed
April-June quarter, the slowest growth rate in almost three years.
   Economists who believe production will keep expanding in the
last half of the year base their optimism on the fact that the
Federal Reserve Board switched from driving interest rates higher
as a way of fighting inflation to easing credit, starting in June,
in order to keep the economy expanding.
   Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist of the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, said the debate over whether the economy would
actually topple into a recession missed the point that the Fed's
year-long effort to slow economic growth had already produced
``unacceptable casualties.''
   He said that the slower growth, even without a recession, would
translate into an extra 500,000 Americans without jobs and $50
billion added to the budget deficit next year.
   ``The economy is struggling and will continue to struggle as a
direct consequence of the Federal Reserve Board's past tight
monetary policy,'' Hunter said.
   In another report showing general weakness, the Labor Department
said Thursday that productivity of American workers edged up a
minuscule 0.2 percent in the April-June quarter after having fallen
by 1.3 percent in the first three months of the year.
   The sluggish growth in productivity, defined as output per hour
of work, was accompanied by rising employment costs. Unit labor
costs rose at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in the second quarter
after an even faster 6.2 percent rate of increase in the second
quarter.
   Economists said this jump in labor costs meant that inflationary
pressures would not abate quickly, even though energy and food
costs have moderated.
   The 0.1 percent drop in the June leading index reflected
widespread weakness, with seven of 11 components declining.
   The biggest negative impact came from drop in raw material
prices. While this is an indication of lessening inflation
pressures, it also can mean less demand, which is viewed as a
negative by the forecasting gauge.
   Other negative forces in June were a jump in unemployment
claims; a fall in building permits; a speedup in business delivery
times, also viewed as a sign of falling demand; a decline in the
length of the average work week; a drop in orders for consumer
goods, and a smaller backlog of unfilled orders for manufactured
goods.
   Four indicators showed strength in June. The biggest plus factor
was a rise in stock prices followed by higher consumer confidence,
faster growth of the money supply and an increase in plant and
equipment orders.
   The various changes left the leading index at 143.5 percent of
its 1982 base of 100.

<HEAD>Safety Board Condemns Broadcast of Cockpit Tape</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   National Transportation Safety Board members
on Thursday condemned the public broadcast of a cockpit voice
recording from an airliner crash as ``lurid entertainment'' and a
threat to the board's work.
   The board voted 5-0 to express regret at an order by a Texas
judge that led to release this week of a tape from a Delta Air
Lines crash in Dallas last August that killed 14 people.
   The board's vote indicated support for Federal Aviation
Administration and Air Line Pilots Association calls for a law that
would bar release of automatically recorded audio tapes recovered
from crash scenes. The board, however, did not propose specific
legislation.
   The law already prohibits the safety board itself from publicly
releasing the 30-minute loop audio tapes which pick up sounds from
microphones in airliner cockpits. The board had turned over a copy
of the Delta tape to the Texas court as evidence in lawsuits
resulting from the crash.
   Delta appealed to the court not to release the tape, but the
judge granted pleas from the plaintiffs and news media for them to
be played.
   After each crash, the board by law makes a transcript and
releases a printed version only of portions relevant to its
investigation.
   Pilot communications with air traffic controllers are regularly
available to media, but FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said he can
recall no previous instance where sounds from a cockpit recorder
were aired publicly.
   The Delta tape, played in radio and television news reports
around the country, included sounds of the pilots of Delta Flight
1141 joking about politics and airplane crashes before the plane
crashed on takeoff. It also includes screams just before the crash.
The crew and more than 90 passengers survived.
   The NTSB, which expects to conclude its investigation of the
Dallas crash Sept. 26, said in a resolution: ``We believe that
transportation safety is better served by maintaining strict
confidentiality of the actual audio recording.''
   The board said it opposed the tape's public release ``or any
other actions which might inhibit effective communication between
crew members, or which might diminish its utility in the prevention
of accidents and the saving of lives.''
   Board member John Lauber said the recording is designed to be
used only in safety investigations, and ``certainly not for the
lurid entertainment of the public.''
   NTSB member Jim Burnett said cockpit tapes are ``painful things
to listen to, and why anyone would entertain the idea of making
either entertainment or drama out of them, I don't know.''
   The board deleted from a draft version of its statement language
that would have condemned the disabling of voice recorders by air
crews. Lauber said members oppose any tampering with the recorders,
which is illegal, but wanted to focus the statement on the
importance of the recorders in safety investigations.
   The pilots union withdrew Wednesday a threat to order its 41,000
members to disable the recorders. ALPA president Henry A. Duffy
said he was confident that Congress would correct the problem.

   The White House today called the suspension of
the death threat against hostage Joseph Cicippio ``an encouraging
and hopeful development'' but said it still doesn't meet U.S.
concerns for release of all the hostages.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater issued a short, written
reaction about 45 minutes after the news from Lebanon that the
terrorists were holding off their execution threat.
   Fitzwater said: ``We regard this as an encouraging and hopeful
development. But it still does not answer our continuing concern
for release of all hostages. We urge that all parties in the region
use whatever influence they have to end the tragedy of hostage
taking and to release those remaining in captivity. And we express
our appreciation to all those who have been thus far trying to
help.''
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said,
``If it is true, it is a positive development that we welcome.''
   ``Bush is pleased, but still concerned,'' Fitzwater said, adding
that the White House had no independent confirmation of the actions.
   Asked if ships would be recalled from the region, he said, ``I
urge everyone to keep in mind, especially in regard to the ships,
that we stil have a serious problem in the Middle East, we still
have hostages and that we will review the situation, but I would
not expect any quick changes in our situation.''
   He said Bush had talked to a dozen world leaders in the past two
or three days, including those from most of the countries in the
Middle East.
   Asked if Bush had sensed the death threat would be suspended, he
replied, ``I don't think we had any signals from any of the heads
of state.''
   ``We continue to press for the release of all the hostages,'' he
said.
   Terrorists first gave Cicippio a four-hour reprieve in their
deadline to kill him, then announced 45 minutes before the new
deadline that they had suspended his execution.
   The latest statement from the kidnappers was delivered to a
Western news agency in Beirut, along with an instant photograph of
Cicippio, looking into the camera with the trace of a smile on his
face.
   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states
with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, we
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution
with an initiative,'' said the 14-line Arabic statement.
   It demanded that Israel release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a
Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped Friday by Israeli commandos, as well
as Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas held in Israel. Lists of
them are to be prepared later and presented to the Red Cross, it
said.
   Previously, the group had only demanded freedom for Obeid and
two companions seized with him.
   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise the
initiative will be considered canceled,'' said the handwritten
message. It did not say if the death sentence would then be
restored.
   Before that announcement, Fitzwater had given a guarded reaction
to developments in the troubled region.
   ``It's very difficult to express very much optimism when they
still have one hostage whose life is under threat and others who
are in captivity with no immediate prospects for relief,''
Fitzwater said before the terrorists announced they had suspended
their deadline for executing Cicippio.
   Asked about reports that Bush had decided to take military
action if Cicippio were killed, Fitzwater said no final decision
has been made.
   ``Obviously that would be a very grave situation and we would be
prepared to deal with it as best we could and I would not preclude
any option one way or another,'' he said.
   He said Bush has made ``preliminary decisions ... of every
kind.''
   ``You may be assured that all of the foundation planning has
been done and consideration of every scenario has been taken and we
will pursue this to the best of our ability,'' Fitzwater said, but
he emphasized, ``The decision's not made 'til the decision is
made.''
   Asked if the United States would hold Iran responsible if
Cicippio were killed, he replied, ``We don't have definitive
information on who is holding the hostages or who is responsible
and therefore we can't offer judgments at this point.''
   However, another administration official said Wednesday that a
U.S. message relayed to Iran earlier through two channels had said
in substance, ``If anything happens to the hostages we hold you
responsible.'' That source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fitzwater said the Bush administration was still pursuing every
diplomatic channel to defuse the crisis.
   ``Clearly, the winds are swirling in the region in terms of
trying to secure their release and trying to influence the
Hezbollah and others who might hold these prisoners,'' said
Fitzwater.
   He reiterated that the president had no plans to hold a special
strategy session with military and diplomatic advisers today, as he
had in previous days since the reported execution on Monday of
Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   A Pentagon spokesman said there had not been any unusual changes
in the deployment of the 6th Fleet ships in the Mediterranean
today. ``All units are conducting routine operations,'' said Lt.
Col. Mel Sunden. The estimated 25 U.S. vessels deployed in the
region ``is usually what we have there,'' he said.
   The terrorists released a videotape of Cicippio asking Israel to
save him by releasing the Moslem cleric.
   The deadline extension, to 3 p.m. EDT, was announced in a
statement delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut along with
the 90-second videotaped appeal by Cicippio.
   ``I appeal to each person having honor who can move to release
Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid ... Don't be late, because they (the
captors) are very serious ...,'' said Cicippio, who appeared
haggard and distressed.
   ``... So to help me move I demand from the American people,
oblige Israel to release ... Obeid immediately because his
kidnapping is not human.''
   The presidential spokesman said, ``We of course do not have any
definitive knowledge as to why they extended the deadline. We hope
it's because they have been swayed by world opinion and pressure
from others that this was not appropriate behavior.
   ``In one way, it's simply a testament to the cruelty of the
situation that you keep having these deadlines extended. There
shouldn't be any deadlines at all,'' he said.
   Fitzwater, asked whether the United States was considering
seeking the extradition of Obeid from Israel for possible
involvement in the kidnapping of Higgins, said ``the Justice
Department, I am told, is looking into the case.''
   A federal law enforcement source, asking not to be identified,
told The Associated Press, ``The FBI is investigating the murder of
Higgins as a possible violation'' of a 1986 anti-terrorist act.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh declined comment on whether
he would seek to extradite Obeid.

<HEAD>Childhood Viral Disease on Rise Across Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A contagious ailment called hand, foot and mouth
disease that is easily transmitted in schools and day-care centers
is suddenly on the rise, with outbreaks among youngsters and their
families across the East and scattered in the Midwest and West,
health officials say.
   ``The information we've had definitely shows a picture of
large-scale activity this year when compared with previous years,''
said Mark Pallansch of the federal Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   Hand, foot and mouth disease is usually not dangerous, although
it is quite contagious, said Dr. Michael Katz, head of pediatrics
at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. ``But the
illness itself only appears in some individuals,'' he said in a
telephone interview Thursday.
   The illness is caused by a strain of coxsackie virus, one of
about 65 so-called enteroviruses that are a common source of
infection. Hand, foot and mouth disease is characterized by sores
in the mouth and blisters on the hands and feet.
   There is no treatment, and the condition usually disappears
within a week, Pallansch said. It can sometimes be more dangerous
in newborns or in a fetus exposed to it in the womb, he said.
   The risk of harm to fetuses is small, said Katz. ``It is better
for a pregnant woman not to be infected with anything,'' said Katz,
but coxsackie virus is not known to cause serious problems.
   Pallansch said precise estimates of the prevalence of the
disease are not possible, because doctors are not required to
report it to their health departments.
   He said the Centers for Disease Control began receiving calls
from the Southeast in February, and that the disease has spread
since then. ``It has moved up the East Coast at least as far as
Boston through the summer,'' he said. Scattered reports have come
in from the Midwest, Utah and California, he added.
   ``Certainly this summer we've received many more calls than the
summer before, so it's my impression it's quite common at the
moment,'' said Dr. Virginia Dato of the New Jersey Department of
Health.
   She said infectious agents like coxsackie virus tend to become
more common every two to five years. A child who has had hand, foot
and mouth disease is immune from future infection with the strain
of virus that caused it, but may get the disease again from a
different strain of virus.
   The only method of preventing the spread of coxsackie virus
infections is frequent hand washing, Pallansch said. Dirty diapers
also carry the virus, accounting for the rapid spread of the
disease in day-care centers, he said.
   Young children with hand, foot and mouth disease can become
dehydrated when the stinging sores in their mouths lead them to
refuse fluids, Pallansch said. Parents should be sure that infected
children are getting enough fluids, he said.
   Swimming pools are an important means of transmission during the
summer, said Katz, but because the disease is usually mild he did
not recommend keeping children out of the pool when the disease is
in the neighborhood. ``I think that's cruel and unusual
punishment,'' he said.
   Enteroviruses usually cause only ``a mild, upper respiratory,
typical summer-cold type illness,'' Pallansch said.
   It is assumed that coxsackie virus can cause meningitis, a more
serious infection of membranes around the brain and spinal cord,
but progression of hand, foot and mouth disease to meningitis is
unlikely except in very rare instances, Pallansch said. And that
form of meningitis itself is normally not too severe, said Katz.

<HEAD>Jackson Registers to Vote in Washington, Mum on Mayoral Race</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson registered to vote in the
District of Columbia on Thursday, but shed no new light on a
possible run for mayor.
   Jackson has previously said he is ``not running'' for mayor in
the nation's capital, but he has refused to rule out entering the
race later. He declined to comment on the subject Thursday.
   He and his wife, Jacqueline, spent about 10 minutes filling out
a series of forms, and registered as Democrats, according to city
elections officials.
   After registering, Jackson said Washington would be the focal
point of his national political agenda, which includes improving
education, fighting drugs and gaining statehood for the District of
Columbia.
   ``I want to be of service to the people of the nation and
Washington D.C.,'' Jackson said. ``Washington, D.C., is the point
of challenge today for an urban policy for the nation.''
   City law requires that mayoral candidates be registered to vote
in the district at least one year before the general election. The
next election is scheduled for Nov. 6, 1990.
   Jackson has said he would never run against Mayor Marion Barry
Jr., an ally from the civil rights movement, but after Barry
declared he would seek a fourth term, Jackson refused to take
himself out of consideration.
   The two-time Democratic presidential hopeful has said he was
moving to the nation's capital to be closer to the legislative
process. The national offices of the Rainbow Coalition, a poor
people's advocacy group Jackson founded, is scheduled to open
offices here in September.
   He has said he has no plans to sell his Chicago home.

<HEAD>Solidarity Senator Refuses Offer To Join Communist Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak on
Thursday offered a Solidarity senator a Cabinet position in his new
government, but the senator turned him down, an opposition
spokesman said.
   Kiszczak proposed the top post in the Ministry of Health to Dr.
Zofia Kuratowska, who is also a senior adviser to Solidarity on
health policy, the spokesman said.
   State TV later reported the offer but not the refusal.
   Ms. Kuratowska refused Kiszczak's offer and told him that
lawmakers belonging to the independent trade union movement did not
plan to enter the government, said Grzegorz Jaszunski, who is also
Ms. Kuratowska's husband.
   Ms. Kuratowska appeared to be the first opposition lawmaker to
be approached to enter the government since Kiszczak was elected
Wednesday by the Sejm, the larger chamber of the National Assembly.
   Efforts to reach opposition floor leaders in the Sejm to learn
of any further offers were unsuccessful.
   In his acceptance speech Wednesday, Kiszczak, Poland's interior
minister for the past eight years, said he hoped to attract
opposition members to his government and that he believed he could
name the Cabinet in about two weeks.
   Communist leaders would like some opposition legislators to join
the government to share some of the responsibility for reform
programs, but Solidarity says it cannot enter the government while
the Communist Party holds a monopoly on power.
   Ms. Kuratowska is a leading critic of state medical policy that
has led to overcrowded hospitals, a shortage of medicine and a
flight of poorly paid medical personnel to the West. She favors
establishment of small clinics to put patients in closer contact
with doctors.
   Jaszunski said she informed Solidarity floor leaders in the
National Assembly of her decision.
   The Sejm must approve the Cabinet. The communist-coalition holds
a 299-161 majority. The Solidarity-dominated Senate, the smaller
chamber of the National Assembly, does not vote on the government.
   Also Thursday, the main opposition daily protested the
Kiszczak's election as prime minister, blaming him in part for a
severe economic crisis.
   ``Society does not understand why someone who represents the
party which is responsible for this situation has to take the lead
of a Cabinet that wants to call itself a government of `national
rescue,' '' the opposition Gazeta Wybcorcza newspaper said.
   There was no immediate comment from Lech Walesa or other
Solidarity leaders.
   Official newspapers did not comment on the choice of the
nation's top policeman as the new head of government and instead
focused on food price increases that took effect this week as part
of market-oriented reform.
   The official communist party newspaper Trybuna Ludu and the
government daily Rzeczpospolita carried only official news agency
reports of the Kiszczak's election without commentary.
   The election of Kiszczak completes a top level political
reshuffle that began with the election of Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
to the newly strengthened post of president on July 19, and the
naming of outgoing Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski as first
secretary of the Communist Party July 29.

Democratic-backed financing plan that President Bush says will
undermine the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   Voting yes were 182 Democrats and 39 Republicans.
   Voting no were 67 Democrats and 132 Republicans.
   Y is yes. N is no. X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the

   The productivity of American workers increased
modestly in the second quarter of the year after declining in the
first, the government said Thursday in a report that also showed
workers got significant pay hikes but lost buying power because of
inflation.
   The Labor Department said non-farm productivity rose at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 0.2 percent in the April-June
period as output climbed 1.7 percent and hours worked by just 1.5
percent.
   That was an improvement over the revised 1.3 percent decline in
non-farm productivity at an annual rate reported for the first
three months of the year.
   Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in the
second quarter, the government said, down from a 6.2 percent gain
in the first three months of the year but still a significant
increase that ultimately translates into higher prices.
   Merrill Lynch's Bruce Steinberg said persistent wage gains would
limit overall inflation declines.
   ``I think the inflation environment is looking somewhat better
than it had been, but this is a cautionary note,'' he said.
   Despite the wage gains _ hourly compensation rose at a 5.5
percent annual rate in the April-June quarter _ American workers
still saw their buying power erode. Real wages _ compensation gains
minus the toll of consumer inflation _ fell at an annual rate of
0.9 percent in the second quarter, the government said.
   ``In some ways we're in the worst of both worlds now,'' said
chief economist David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill. ``The worker is
seeing wages go up less than inflation and the manufacturer is
seeing employment costs going up more than prices because of wage
gains and the explosion of fringe benefit costs.''
   Analysts said the declines or only modest productivity gains in
recent quarters were consistent with an economy nearing the end of
an expansion but said they were not necessarily a harbinger of
recession.
   Improved productivity _ the output per hour of all workers _ is
considered vital to sustaining economic growth at times of
near-full employment.
   With the current slowdown in the economy, productivity gains or
declines also will have a large effect on business profits because
uncertainty about the economy has left many businesses,
particularly in manufacturing, reluctant to hire new workers as a
means of improving output.
   The report issued Thursday was based on preliminary data that
generally are revised in a more comprehensive report issued a month
later.
   Manufacturing workers posted a significant gain in productivity
in the second quarter _ 2.4 percent at an annual rate _ but that
figure was influenced by a 0.3 percent drop in total hours worked,
another sign of the slowing economy.
   Inflation's toll was even more pronounced on manufacturing
workers, whose hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 2.5
percent in the second quarter while consumer inflation increased
more than 6 percent _ meaning real wages paid manufacturing workers
fell at an annual rate of 3.7 percent in the latest quarter.
   The report also included revised productivity data for the years
1986 through 1988 showing productivity growth was slightly better
than originally believed, rising by 2 percent in 1986, 1.1 percent
in 1987 and 2.1 percent in 1988. Earlier data had put the increases
in those years at 2.0 percent, 0.8 percent and 1.5 percent,
respectively.
   The Bush administration, which had been criticized for using
unrealistic productivity estimates for its economic forecasts, took
satisfaction in the upward revision.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said that the administration was ``quite pleased that
non-farm productivity growth for 1986-88 was revised to a rate
almost exactly in line with our current thinking about the
economy's long run growth potential.''

<HEAD>Legislation's Pay Provisions Produce Their Own Discord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buried beneath the big-ticket strategic
weapons systems in the Senate's military authorization bill are a
series of pay provisions that are stirring plenty of controversy on
their own.
   The Senate overwhelmingly approved a $295 billion defense
package Wednesday that largely endorses President Bush's Star Wars
program, the B-2 stealth bomber and intercontinental ballistic
missiles.
   The measure also allows the Defense and Energy departments to
pay 525 scientists and engineers more money than the vice president
and gives law enforcement agents the final option of shooting down
an aircraft suspected of transporting drugs.
   By Thursday, House Republicans and Democrats alike were casting
a wary eye on the pay provisions while an association of government
executives expressed its outrage.
   ``I don't think the House is willing to increase the pay'' of
those affected by the legislation, said Rep. William Dickinson of
Alabama, ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
   Under the provision, the Defense Department could raise the pay
of 500 scientists and engineers and the Energy Department could
boost the salaries of 25 employees up to 150 percent of the amount
they would normally be paid under the current federal pay system.
   The 525 employees could end up with $134,250 per year, more than
the vice president, who receives $110,000 annually, and members of
Congress and Cabinet officers, who get $89,500.
   The provision's objective is to retain first-class scientists
and engineers who might otherwise leave government for the private
sector. But in a Congress still hurting from the rancorous debate
earlier this year over pay raises for members, the provision seems
sure to face a tough road when House and Senate members meet in
conference in early September to craft a final defense blueprint.
   ``I do not believe the House will accept that unless relief is
given to members. Congress has to deal with the whole issue,'' said
Dickinson, who as the No. 1 Republican on the Armed Services panel
will likely serve on the conference.
   ``I don't see that having a chance to survive the conference,''
said Rep. Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., the chairman of the Armed
Services subcommittee on research and development and a likely
House conferee.
   Unlike the Senate bill, the House version of military spending
legislation has no such pay provisions.
   The Senate package also allows Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to
hire 1,000 retired officers, and the Energy Department 250, who
could still draw full pensions.
   The Pentagon also would be authorized to set up four pilot
programs under which the department could adjust rank and pay of a
total of 100,000 civilian employees, giving the department a
flexibility that current law forbids.
   Individuals could receive pay increases as long as total payroll
costs did not change.
   Other government departments could operate a total of six such
programs. The Office of Personnel Management would have to approve
the provisions of these programs.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, in opposing some of the pay provisions
during Senate debate on the bill, said late Tuesday night that if
enacted, the measure ``will begin the dismantlement of the civil
service as we know it.''
   The Senior Executives Association, in a statement released
Thursday, called the legislation ``an ill-conceived, poisonous stew
that will sicken the federal executive corps and federal personnel
management.''
   The organization represents about 7,200 senior executives in the
government.
   The other defense measure that had garnered criticism and faces
a tough fight in conference is a provision sponsored by Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., that gives law enforcement agents the right to
shoot down a plane suspected of carrying contraband if the plane
refuses to land despite warning shoots.
   ``The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association is shocked at
Senator McConnell's absurd proposal to shoot down general aviation
aircraft,'' said Patricia Weil, a spokeswoman for the group, which
represents operators of 290,000 small planes.
   ``To suggest that suspected aircraft be shot down is
irresponsible, impractical and could endanger the lives of innocent
people,'' Ms. Weil said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. and the chairman of the Armed Services
panel, opposed the measure and Glenn, a former astronaut and pilot,
expressed the fear that he could be one of the innocent people
endangered by the provision.
   The Senate turned aside an effort to defeat the amendment by a
vote of 55-45 and then approved the measure by voice vote.

<HEAD>Police Storm Strikebound Plant; 1 Worker Killed, Hundreds Detained</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEJLA SAMMAKIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HELWAN, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police stormed Egypt's largest steel plant
during a sit-down strike, killing one worker, injuring 14 and
arresting hundreds, officials and newspapers said Thursday.
   Two policemen also were reported injured in the clash Wednesday
as up to 5,000 workers sat at the exit gate of the plant 18 miles
south of the capital Cairo, the reports said.
   The government-owned newspaper Al-Akhbar said 81 workers
probably would be charged with resisting arrest, blocking
production and destruction of public property at the sprawling
plant, which employs more than 24,000 people. It said 596 other
workers were being questioned.
   The daily Al-Ahram newspaper, in its early Friday edition, said
only 497 workers had been detained. It said prosecutors ordered 82
workers jailed for 15 days while 415 others had been questioned and
released.
   Due to a Moslem holiday, security officials were unavailable for
comment on the clash or the strike, which was called to press
demands for higher wages and better working conditions.
   But Diaa Tantawi, board chairman of the Iron and Steel Complex
at Helwan, said the strike ``was not a question of wages or
incentive payments.''
   He said about 60 employees blocked the exit preventing about
3,000 workers from leaving at the end of Wednesday's morning shift.
   ``They used iron bars to stop the workers from leaving,''
Tantawi said.
   ``There definitely were political elements involved'' in the
strike, he said. He refused to characterize their motives except to
rule out Moslem extremist fundamentalism, often at the center of
unrest in Egypt.
   The board chairman estimated the loss of a day's work cost the
company $800,000 and that property damage was about $5,800.
   Work resumed at about half capacity Thursday as investigators
toured the site to assess damage. There was no sign of unrest or of
extra security at the grounds, but 10 vans filled with riot-police
were at a police station about half a mile away.
   The Helwan complex employs 24,600 workers, Tantawi said. It was
a showpiece of Soviet aid to Egypt during the time of the late
socialist President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who led the coup that ended
the Egyptian monarchy in 1952.
   The two alleged strike leaders, who escaped, were board members
elected under a Nasser-era law that sets aside half the seats on
the board of a public company for workers.
   Previous strikes and demonstrations at other state-run
industries allegedly involved members of leftist political parties
and communists.
   Strikes and demonstrations are banned under an emergency law in
force since Oct. 7, 1981, a day after Moslem extremists
assassinated Anwar Sadat, Nasser's successor.

<HEAD>Farmer Turns Field of Weeds into New Cash Crop</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By ROBERT LEE ZIMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WOODSTOCK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It looks like a farmer's worst nightmare:
fields overrun with velvet leaf, cocklebur, thistle and wild oats.
   But it's a dream come true for Wendel Moore, who carefully
cultivates these unlikely cash crops.
   Moore is the king of weeds.
   ``People really think I've flipped my lid,'' said Moore,
chuckling. ``Through the years there have been a lot of horse
laughs, but I'm the one who gets the last laugh.''
   Moore, 58, operates F&amp;J Seed Service with his wife and
son-in-law. He raises 60 varieties of weeds for seed on 44 acres in
McHenry County, sometimes harvesting weeds from other farmers'
fields as he travels the Midwest.
   Much of Moore's crop is sold to universities and chemical
companies for research.
   ``We grow about 30 varieties and evaluate their response to the
herbicides we apply,'' said Zach Fore, research biologist at the
FMC Corp. farm in Champaign County. Fore said Moore was only one of
three weed seed growers in the country of which he was aware.
   Moore's fields may look ugly to other farmers, but he figures
he's helping to make farming more profitable.
   ``Where would world food production be without herbicides?'' he
said in a recent interview.
   His adventure in weed farming began in 1976, when he bought the
business from friends. They taught him what they could, and he
picked up the rest from weed books and experience.
   Growing weeds may sound like child's play, but Moore has the
same headaches as any other farmer. Perhaps more so, since the
average farmer plants only two or three crops, where he must
understand the growing habits of dozens.
   ``There are different planting dates, harvesting dates, seed
size and natural enemies,'' said Moore. ``It presents monstrous
problems.''
   And when it's time to put in the crops, he said, ``I have to use
all kinds of ingenuity.''
   For example, Moore plants an upright crop like flax so a
low-growing one, like bind weed, has something to climb, making
harvest easier.
   Herbicides are out of the question on a weed farm, so fields are
likely to have more than one crop.
   Many weeds are harvested with a combine, and the seeds
hand-separated by variety.
   Sulphur cinquefoil seed ``is as small as dust,'' while some
other seeds are bigger than soybeans, said Moore, who uses a
garbage can under the combine chute to keep the smaller seeds from
blowing away.
   Black and red nightshade berries are squeezed of their juice and
then dried in the sun to obtain the seeds. Moore puts other seeds
in a garbage can and then pounds them with a baseball bat to thresh
them from their husks.
   Afterward the seed is cleaned, packaged and shipped all over the
world. Some sell for as much as $3 an ounce.
   In addition to what he grows on his farm, Moore combs the
Midwest looking for weeds.
   Once, he recalled, he found a field of wild proso millet in
Wisconsin, persuaded the farmer to let him take it, then hired a
man with a combine to harvest the weeds. ``He made a good buck and
I got a lot of good seed.''
   Moore, who grew up on a Mississippi farm and spent long hours in
the sun hacking away at weeds, said, ``Now, it's become a real
passion.''

   Two of the frostiest spots in
the country are trying to resolve their two-year battle over which
can call itself ``Icebox of the Nation.''
   Fraser, Colo., a mountain hamlet of 730, holds the federal
copyright to the nickname, but International Falls, a town on the
Canadian border with 5,500 residents, has challenged the claim in
two cases before the U.S. Department of Commerce Patent and
Trademark Office.
   International Falls wants the nickname to itself so it can
promote its cold-weather product testing, which means more than
$300,000 a year to the local economy. The city also has been
designated as the site of Minnesota's cold-weather resource center.
   International Falls has a mean temperature in January of only
slightly above zero, about 11 degrees colder than Fraser. But the
year-round average is colder in Fraser.
   International Falls has decided to offer $2,000 if Fraser will
confine its use of the frosty title to Colorado.
   The offer is undergoing legal review, so hadn't formally been
made by Thursday, but Fraser town manager Clay Brown said Wednesday
that the offer probably would be considered seriously.
   The City Council here voted 5-2 Monday to pay the $2,000 to help
offset Fraser's court costs after discovering that it could cost
International Falls $20,000 to keep up the legal battle.

   Reading her mother's law books at age
8 has paid off for newly appointed District Judge Sherrie Krauser,
who was sworn in Thursday to the bench from which her mother
recently retired.
   Although Senior Judge Bess Lavine retired in April, she returns
frequently as a substitute judge, making her and Krauser the
nation's first mother-daughter team ruling from a bench, according
to the National Association of Women Judges.
   Lavine, 61, was the first woman to hold countywide office in
Prince George's County when she was elected a probate judge in
1954. She's been on the district court bench for 11 years. Her
38-year-old daughter's resume also speaks for itself: high school
graduation at 16, law school graduation at 22.
   ``Sherrie was always very precocious,'' said Lavine, whose
husband and son are lawyers. ``I knew she was fated when I came
home from work one day and found her reading my law book on damages
when she was 8 years old. I said to her, `Sherrie, do you
understand this?' And she said, `Yes, it's very interesting.'''
   District Court judges usually hear cases dealing with traffic
offenses, domestic troubles, landlord-tenant problems and small
claims.

   A highway repair contractor proved
that cold cash is a good incentive, finishing in less than 16 days
a highway repaving project that usually takes three months.
   Motorists are getting back the busy, seven-mile stretch of
Interstate 96 west of here more quickly than they had anticipated,
but they're paying for it. The state Department of Transportation
agreed to pay the contractor a $500-an-hour bonus for each hour by
which it beat the 24-day deadline.
   The project began July 17 and was completed Wednesday after 375
hours _ or 15 days, 15 hours.
   The contractor, Thompson-McCully Co. of Belleville, will receive
a $100,000 bonus _ the limit set by the DOT _ on top of the
contract price of $1.4 million.
   It was the first such cash incentive project offered by the
state, and it isn't likely to be the last.
   ``With the success of this project, we'll be looking at future
work to see where similar accelerated procedures can be used,''
William J. MacCreery, DOT deputy director for highways, said in a
release.
   Crews worked from about 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. six or seven days a
week to get the job done with the minimum traffic disruption on the
four-lane highway, which carries an average of 24,000 vehicles a
day.
   ``They earned it,'' said Rod Wyns, DOT supervising engineer for
the project. ``Our people and theirs worked 70 to 80 hours a week
to get the job done, and get it done right.''
   The contractor said it was unsure how much of the $100,000 bonus
would go toward employees' overtime.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Laboratory Test Successful</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force said Thursday it successfully
completed a laboratory test for part of the Star Wars system
designed to destroy enemy missiles by colliding with them.
   The test, the fourth in a series, was conducted at the Air
Force's Astronautics Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base on
Tuesday.
   The Star Wars system, formally known as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, would make use of space-based interceptors to destroy
hostile missiles. Orbiting interceptors would be launched at
extremely high speeds and destroy targeted missiles by the force of
impact.
   Tuesday's test involved technologies needed to locate enemy
missiles and guide interceptors to destroy them.
   The interceptor vehicle remained in a laboratory while it used
sensors to target a missile on the test range, said a statement
issued at the Pentagon.
   The intercepter vehicle was able to detect and track the
missile's plume and then distinguish between the plume and the hard
body of the missile, the statement said.
   ``This ability is essential if the SBI (space-based interceptor)
is to function effectively in a ballistic missile defense system,''
the statement said.

   They are all part of Rock Circus, a new museum that tells the
story of rock and pop from Buddy Holly to Bruce Springsteen using
wax models, animated electronic figures and stereo headsets.
   ``It's a theater show where we bring the greats of rock and pop,
even the dead ones, to life,'' said general manager Martin King at
a preview Thursday. The museum at the London Pavilion, in
Piccadilly Circus, opens Monday.
   Fifty of the world's top rock and pop stars singing some of the
best-known songs from the mid-1950s onward were reproduced with the
help of sculptors and other artists at the famed Madame Tussaud's
waxwork studios in west London.
   The recorded sounds are converted through a modulator into
infrared signals which tune into the headsets of visitors making
their way from one exhibit to the next.
   The highlight is a 20-minute theater of ``animatronic'' robots
viewed from a revolving auditorium. The lifelike figures mimic the
stage antics of such stars as Springsteen belting out ``Born in the
USA,'' Bob Dylan singing ``The Times They Are A-Changin','' and
Elvis Presley, complete with curling lip, crooning ``Love Me
Tender.''
   A video of a spaceship blasting off for space leads into an
appearance by Bowie's computer-programmed double, dressed in an
astronaut suit and floating in a most peculiar way while singing,
``This is Major Tom to Ground Control ...''
   Janis Joplin narrates the 1960s rock 'n' roll culture from a
graffiti-strewn park bench, then stands up shakily to sing her hit
single, ``Me and Bobby McGee.'' Joplin died of a drug overdose in
San Francisco in 1970.
   The Beatles open and close the set with a rendition of ``Sgt.
Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,'' dressed in replicas of the
costumes on the cover of the 1967 album of the same name.
   There's a wax model of Buddy Holly singing ``Peggy Sue'' in a
radio studio in 1958 and being interviewed by disc jockey Alan
Freed about the dangers of flying to dozens of concerts across the
United States. Holly was killed Feb. 3, 1959, in a plane crash near
Mason City, Iowa.
   Jerry Lee Lewis gets his piano smoking with ``Whole Lotta
Shakin' Goin' On'' alongside Chuck Berry's rock classic ``Johnny B
Goode.''
   Others include Mick Jagger and Keith Richards (``I Can't Get No
Satisfaction''), Marvin Gaye (``I Heard It Through the
Grapevine''), and Simon and Garfunkel (``Sounds of Silence'').

<HEAD>Congress Eases Abortion Restrictions in Capital Despite Veto Threat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ignored a veto threat by President
Bush and voted Thursday to ease restrictions on public financing of
abortions in the District of Columbia, halting nine straight years
of House votes tightening control over government abortion aid.
   The 238-189 vote sent the measure to the Senate, where lawmakers
are generally considered more sympathetic to the pro-choice side.
   The legislation is the first containing abortion language that
Congress has considered since the Supreme Court granted states the
rights to impose new limitations on abortion last month.
   Thus, the vote was seen by some as possessing symbolism far
beyond the district's borders. They argued that the high court's
ruling has caught the attention of the majority of Americans who
favor the right to choose an abortion, and that these voters are
carefully watching their members of Congress.
   ``It's not a turkey shoot any longer,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin,
D-Ore., a leader of the pro-choice lawmakers. ``You can't vote
anti-abortion because you think that's the path of least
resistance.''
   Despite the vote, AuCoin conceded that the House still does not
have a pro-choice majority.
   ``There isn't one,'' he said. ``But this tells you there is a
sea change under way.''
   In fact, the House approved a Department of Health and Human
Services spending bill Wednesday prohibiting federal aid for
abortions unless the mother's life was threatened. The provision,
which the House has renewed every year since 1976, was approved
without debate.
   Bush's veto threat, in a letter dated Wednesday, called on
lawmakers ``to protect the lives of America's unborn children.''
   He warned that he would veto the measure if it allowed public
money to be used for abortions ``other than those where the life of
the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried to term.''
   The climactic fight on the bill occurred Wednesday evening.
   To the shock of members on both sides of the issue, the House
rejected 219-206 an amendment sponsored by Rep. Robert Dornan,
R-Calif., that would have flatly prohibited the use of federal or
district monies to perform abortions. Voting against the proposal
were 179 Democrats and 40 Republicans, while 71 Democrats and 135
Republicans supported Dornan.
   ``We got enough votes to prove we have veto sustainability,''
Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., a leading anti-abortion lawmaker,
said Thursday. Congress can overturn a presidential veto only with
a two-thirds vote of each chamber.
   The Wednesday night vote was a reversal of a 222-186 tally in
favor of the same language last year. According to a check of
records by groups on both sides of the issue, it was the first time
since September 1980 that the House defeated an effort to restrict
public financing for abortions.
   With the amendment's defeat, language in the bill was left
intact allowing the district to spend its own money for abortion
and permitting federal funds for abortions in which the mother's
life is at stake or rape or incest is involved.
   Currently, public assistance is available in the district only
when the mother's life is threatened.
   Dornan and his supporters said they lost because of misleading
lobbying by their opponents, who they said falsely told lawmakers
arriving in the chamber to vote that the amendment would forbid
public assistance for contraceptives.
   ``What changed was a very deceptive effort,'' said Smith.
   AuCoin said his side was helped by the Dornan proposal's failure
to allow an exemption for abortions involving mothers whose lives
were in danger. Dornan said he omitted that exemption because he
was forced to do so by House procedures.

   Yasser Arafat said Thursday that although
the PLO disliked Israel's plan for elections in the occupied lands,
it would have accepted it if the plan had been a step toward
Palestinian self-determination.
   The PLO chief added that the plan was merely aimed at
``perpetuating the Israeli occupation of the occupied territories''
and has now collapsed in failure.
   Arafat made the comments in an opening address to the fifth
general congress of the Fatah movement, the main component of the
Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The congress has drawn about 1,050 delegates from throughout the
Arab world, and spokesman Abdul Abdel-Rahman said that high on the
agenda would be the hostage crisis in Lebanon.
   The Fatah leadership on Tuesday condemned the reported killing
of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, but blamed Israel.
Israeli commandos on July 28 abducted Lebanese Shiite leader Sheik
Abdul Karim Obeid from his home in southern Lebanon.
   Arafat did not mention the hostage crisis in his address.
   The PLO has rejected an offer by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to hold elections in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
and talks with elected Palestinian representatives on interim
self-rule for the 1.7 million Arabs living there. It has said no
elections are possible under occupation, and has demanded at least
a partial Israeli withdrawal.
   Shamir is sharply opposed to both notions.
   Speaking to frequent applause, Arafat said ``the PLO would have
accepted this plan if it had constituted a stage in the realization
of the rights of the Palestinian people to self-determination and
freedom.''
   ``I take this opportunity to ask the American government how
long it intends to continue ignoring the right of the Palestinian
people to self-determination, and how many wars we will still have
to fight to emerge from the vicious circle of blood and
suffering,'' he said.
   ``The intefadeh (uprising) will not stop until the conclusion of
a peace treaty and the realization of the Palestinian people's
inalienable right to return to self-determination and to the
establishment of a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital.''
   The congress went into closed session immediately after Arafat
spoke and was due to elect half the members of a new 21-member
central committee. Three of the present members have been
assassinated and two others have joined the hard-line dissidents.
   Twice during the opening session, the delegates observed a
moment's silence in memory of Arafat's deputy, Khalil Al Wazir _
better known as Abu Jihad _ and other martyrs. Abu Jihad was killed
in Tunis in an Israeli commando raid last year.
   Abu Jihad's widow, Intissar Al Wazir, was given a standing
ovation on entering the congress hall and is virtually certain to
be elected to the central committee.
   Tunisian President Zine Abidine Ben Ali also spoke to the
opening session, claiming that the summit of the world's seven main
industrial countries, held in Paris during the bicentennial
celebrations of the French revolution, had endorsed the PLO demand
for an international conference on the Middle East.
   ``The acceptance, by the seven, of such a conference shows how
Israel's isolation on the international scene has grown while the
just Palestinian cause has made new achievements even inside
Israel,'' Ben Ali said.

   Sleepy residents raced to bomb shelters
Thursday as Syrian and Christian gunners unleashed a barrage of
shellfire on residential districts of the ravaged city, killing
three people and wounding six.
   By police count, 514 people have been killed and 2,176 wounded
in the 20-week-old confrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun's
predominantly Christian Lebanese army troops and Syrian soldiers.
   The fighting has driven 1.3 million of the capital's 1.5 million
residents from the city.
   Shell explosions and ambulance sirens echoed before the barrages
ebbed into sporadic exchanges of gunfire across the dividing Green
Line.
   The few remaining civilians in this virtual ghost city emerged
from underground shelters early in the day to inspect their
apartments.
   Thousands of cars flooded the highway south of Beirut, which is
the only road connecting the city's western Moslem sector with the
rest of the country.
   ``Most of those who have fled Beirut returned for a short visit
early in the day to check on their apartments and businesses after
a night of shelling,'' said a police spokesman who cannot be named
by regulation.
   He said it could not be determined who started the duels that
erupted around 1 a.m. with 155mm U.S.-made howitzers and 130mm
Soviet-designed artillery.
   Both sides targeted residential districts as well as enemy
batteries, at times blasting the city with eight shells a minute,
he said.
   Several shells scored direct hits on apartment buildings,
shattering walls and glass and hurling pieces of gutted furniture
into deserted streets.
   The renewed heavy shelling came two days after an Arab League
committee announced that a two-month diplomatic effort to negotiate
a lasting cease-fire in Lebanon has failed because of differences
with Syria.
   Syria is the main power-broker in Lebanon and has 40,000 troops
in Moslem areas of the country under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun, a Maronite Catholic, and other Christian leaders accuse
the Syrians of betraying their mandate by siding with the Moslems.
   Christian leaders have welcomed Tuesday's statement by the
foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Algeria because it
explicitly accuses Syria of blocking peace efforts.
   King Hassan II of Morocco, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid were asked at an Arab summit
May 26 to find a peace settlement by November. But their foreign
ministers shuttled in vain between Beirut and Damascus.
   Iraq, Syria's main Arab enemy, called Wednesday for an emergency
Arab summit to try and end the strife that has killed more than
150,000 people since Lebanon's civil war began in April 1975.
   Iraq supports the Christians in Lebanon and has been arming
Aoun's 20,000-strong force.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said Wednesday the Bush administration is ``disappointed that the
Arab League has not received the necessary cooperation from all
parties to the conflict, both the Lebanese and Syrians, to end
immediate fighting, lift blockades and address the underlying
political issues.''
   ``We urge the Arab League not to lay down its burden, despite
the enormous difficulties it has encountered,'' she added.
   The violence broke out after Aoun blockaded illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed militias.
   Syrian and allied Moslem forces retaliated by shelling and
laying siege to the enclave that usually is home to 1 million
Christians.

   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee and 13 other congressmen will travel to the Soviet Union
Saturday for a first-hand look at military facilities and for
meetings with Kremlin officials.
   ``Much has been said about restructuring the Soviet military for
defensive purposes but we'd like to see those changes, not merely
hear about them,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
Armed Services Committee.
   The group plans to visit army units in the Soviet Union and East
Germany, the Soviet General Staff Academy, the Baikonur space
launch facility and a location where intermediate-range nuclear
weapons are destroyed.
   The delegation also will meet with officials in Moscow and
members of the Committee for Defense and State Security, which is a

   America's low productivity rate, which has
worried economists for years, is not as bad as originally believed,
the Labor Department said Thursday.
   The department said that productivity has increased at an
average annual rate of 1.8 percent over the last three years, up
from an original estimate of an average increase of 1.4 percent per
year.
   The 1.4 percent figure, which reflected sub-par productivity
rates in 1987 and 1988, had analysts concerned about the country's
economic outlook. Rising living standards hinge on the ability to
keep productivity increasing at a healthy rate.
   Economists had also questioned the Bush administration's
economic outlook, which was based on a projection that productivity
would grow in the years ahead at a 1.8 percent rate.
   Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser, took
note of the Labor Department revisions in a statement released by
his office.
   ``We had been anticipating some upward revision in the
productivity estimates and were quite pleased that nonfarm
productivity growth for 1986-88 was revised to a rate almost
exactly in line with our current thinking about the economy's
long-run growth potential,'' he said.
   The revised figures showed that nonfarm productivity increased
by 2.1 percent in 1988, compared to a previous estimate of 1.5
percent. For 1987, the increase was put at 1.1 percent, up from a
previous estimate of 0.8 percent. Productivity growth in 1986 was
unchanged at 2 percent.
   Some private economists, however, remained sceptical about the
new figures.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
believed that the government was miscounting total economic output
as covered by the gross national product. He said this had the
effect of inflating productivity, which is defined as total output
divided by the number of hours worked.
   ``I think the Commerce Department has committed a serious error
with their measurment of GNP,'' Evans said. ``They have
artificially raised real growth and this makes productivity look
better than it is.''

<HEAD>GAO Says NRC Must Tighten Controls Over Shutdown of Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission must tighten
its controls over the shutdown of nuclear sites to assure they are
properly decontaminated of radioactive wastes, a congressional
study concluded Thursday.
   The report by the General Accounting Office, an arm of Congress,
said the NRC in the past has approved the decommissioning of some
nuclear facilities without adequate attention being paid to a
thorough decontamination.
   In two of eight cases reviewed by the GAO, investigators found
that sites were allowed to be closed and the land opened for
unrestricted use while there was still substantial radioactive
contamination in the area.
   Each of the eight sites examined were locations of former
nuclear fuel processing facilities.
   At one site contamination was found to be as much as 320 times
greater than allowed by NRC guidelines, while at another site it
was as much as four times greater, although the government approved
the facilities' transfer to general use.
   The GAO found that in four of the eight cases, licensees kept
incomplete records on where contaminated wastes were buried on a
site, making it impossible to determine later where wastes had been
buried. At one location, radioactive materials were discovered 10
years after the NRC decommissioned the site and opened it for
unrestricted use.
   There has been no major nuclear power plant decommissioned in
this country, but the decommissioning process has concluded or is
under way at seven smaller plants, scores of research or military
reactors as well as fuel processing plants.
   The GAO findings were released at a hearing of the House
Government Operations subcommittee on the environment where NRC
Chairman Kenneth M. Carr acknowledged past shortcomings in the
agency's decommissioning program.
   ``The GAO conclusions ... are in line with our own conclusions
and their report has highlighted actions we believe to be
necessary,'' said Carr. He said many of the closings approved by
the NRC occurred years ago and ``decommissioning procedures that
were once considered appropriate may no longer be so today.''

<HEAD>Former AP Paris Photo Editor Dead at 69</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Nash, former photo and communications chief
in Paris for The Associated Press, died Thursday of cancer. He was
69.
   Nash, former assistant chief of bureau, photo editor and chief
of communications, retired in 1985 after 44 years with AP, one of
the longest-serving members of its foreign service.
   He restored AP newsphoto services in France after World War II
ann when photographers used bulky box-like Speed
Graphic cameras and ended as the era of electronic darkrooms and
computerized photo editing terminals was beginning.
   During World War II, Nash used a Speed Graphic to make pictures
of German V-1 rockets falling on London that appeared on front
pages around the world.
   When Nash retired, he was awarded the City of Paris Vermeil
Medal for distinguished accomplishment in one's profession.
   Nash also was decorated by Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba
for widely published photographs he took in 1952 showing unrest in
the French colony, which became independent four years later.
   ``Mike was a rare bird in the early days of the AP picture
service in Europe,'' said Harold G. Buell, assistant general
manager for NewsPhotos. ``He could shoot pictures, he could handle
the desk and he soon came to provide needed insights into
networking and development of AP's complicated picture system.''
   ``Nash drove no one harder than himself in doing a first-class
job in every respect,'' said Paris AP Bureau Chief Harry Dunphy.
``He trained a generation of photographers and editors.''
   Nash was born Aug. 6, 1919, in London, where he joined the AP in
1942 as a photo editor. A few months later he switched to
photographer.
   After the 1944 liberation of Paris from German occupation, the
25-year-old Nash was sent to rebuild the AP photo service. On June
1, 1945, the AP resumed delivery of news photos to Paris newspapers.
   A year later, Nash returned to active service as a photographer
and for the next six years worked in Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.
   In 1952, Nash returned to the photo editor's job in Paris, a
position he held for 34 years. He established AP's wirephoto
network in 1956.
   Nash developed and trained photographers and editors who covered
wars and rebellions in Indochina, North Africa, the Congo, Vietnam,
the Middle East and Iran.
   In 1978, Nash took on additional duties as chief of
communications in Paris.
   Nash is survived by his wife, Elsie, and their sons Max, AP's
photo editor in Tel Aviv, and Timothy, an architect in London.

   The critics may have hated it, but NBC's new
news program, ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow,'' had the highest
A.C. Nielsen rating for an NBC news special in 10 years.
   The first of three summer specials launching a ``news
anthology'' trounced the reruns on CBS and ABC on Wednesday
evening. ``Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow'' had a rating of 12.0 and
a 23 share to an 8.2 and 16 for ABC's `ezing in
Idaho's Boise and Payette National Forests. But the forecast was
for rising temperatures through the weekend.
   ``Obviously we would very happy if the weather stayed the
same,'' said fire center spokesman Arnold Hartigan. ``Higher
temperatures and low humidity are going to complicate matters for
firefighters.''
   In Idaho, where the fires have blackened 98,000 acres,
firefighters and National Guardsmen struggled to hack containment
lines around fires in the western and central parts of the state.
National Guardsmen helped firefighters cut lines around the fires
and protect scattered buildings in the Boise and Payette national
forests.
   In Oregon, Army infantry troops joined the fight Thursday
against fires that have burned 85,000 acres of forest east of the
Cascades.
   About 650 soldiers from Fort Lewis, Wash., joined 330
firefighters on the lines around a 13,300-acre fire in the Monument
Rock Wilderness southwest of Baker, Ore. Because machinery is
barred from about 70 miles southwest of Baker and three miles
from a 13,300-acre fire in the Monument Rock Wilderness. Because
machinery is barred from wilderness areas, the soldiers will be
assigned to the tedious task of cutting fire lines with hand tools.
   One more day of ``on-the-job'' training was planned Friday along
relatively safe fire lines already established at the fire, said
U.S. Forest Service spokesman Steve Sorseth.
   A 23,300-acre fire on the boundary of the Eagle Cap Wildneress
area northwest of Baker destroyed a small snowmobile hut, but
spared the Lick Creek Guard Station, which is on the National
Register of Historic Places, said Bruce McMillan, Wallowa-Whitman
National Forest spokesman.
   In California, where 35,000 acres have been charred, the weather
was no help to crews fighting a fire Thursday in the Cleveland
National Forest 90 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   The 10,300-acre blaze was two miles from the Eagle Crag nature
sanctuary, home to spotted owls and bald eagles, and was within 5
miles of the Palomar Observatory, said Forest Service spokeswoman
Rosalinda Ewen.
   The observatory, which houses a museum, gallery and telescope,
sits atop a hill and is surrounded by three smaller dwellings, and
by dry chaparral brush.
   The fire had been headed toward the observatory, but then turned
away late Thursday morning, and didn't pose an immediate threat,
said Forest Service spokesman Bill Bruggema.
   The blaze was 60 percent contained, but if it reached the nature
sanctuary, the battle would be tougher because of rough terrain and
a ban on using equipment.
   The Eagle Crag area contains giant stands of native Douglas firs
and manzanita trees believed to be the oldest in the Southwest.
   One firefighter suffered a broken collarbone Wednesday battling
the blaze that was started by gunfire.
   In Montana, fire engines stood by to protect two mountain cabins
as a lightning-sparked fire in dead timber grew quickly to 500
acres on the Crow Indian Reservation southeast of Billings. An
800-acre grass and timber fire in the Custer National Forest in the
state's southeastern corner was contained.
   The fire season is worsening throughout the West, Allan West, a
Forest Service deputy chief, said at a Washington, D.C., news
conference Thursday. Fire conditions are extreme to severe in 14
states.
   ``Long-range weather forecasts indicate continuing severe fire
conditions, leaving this fire season with the potential to be as
severe as last year's,'' he said. ``We see no relief through the
month of October in precipitation and temperature.''
   So far this year, more than 39,400 fires have been reported
burning 1.38 million acres. That compares with almost 61,200 fires
covering 2.37 million acres through the same time period last year.

<HEAD>Governing Party Lawmakers Cry Foul Over Selection Process</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of governing party lawmakers Thursday
criticized the party's process for selecting the next prime
minister, saying the front-running candidate was chosen in
back-room deals.
   Factions in the scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party were
expected to declare their support Thursday for Toshiki Kaifu, a
former education minister who became the front-runner Wednesday to
succeed resigning Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.
   The party's largest group, the Takeshita faction, indicated it
will support Kaifu for party president, who is assured election as
prime minister by the Liberal Democratic-dominated lower house of
Parliament.
   But members of a faction led by former Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, decided the closed-door meetings from which Kaifu's
candidancy emerged ``will disappoint the public,'' a faction
spokesman said.
   ``This method of selecting a party president is not good for the
party or for the people,'' the spokesman said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   An election for party president is scheduled for Tuesday, but
party officials say Kaifu could be declared winner without a ballot
if no other candidates enter before Saturday's deadline.
   The vote in the lower house of Parliament is expected Aug. 10.
The upper house does not vote for prime minister.
   ``We believe there should be at least one other candidate for
the party presidency, and will do our best to turn it into a real
election,'' the Miyazawa spokesman said.
   Kaifu, a 10-term lower house member, officially announced his
candidacy Wednesday after his faction's leader, Toshio Komoto, 78,
was persuaded by other faction leaders not to run. Party officials
have said the party needs a younger image for upcoming lower house
elections.
   Analysts say Kaifu, 58, also was favored because party elders
believe he will not threaten their own future bids for leadership
since he has a small power base.
   The conservative governing party's five major factions are
differentiated more by personal and financial allegiances than by
political differences.
   Shin Kanemaru, chairman of the Takeshita faction, indicated it
will back Kaifu but postponed an official statement of support.
   ``Kaifu is an excellent person and a suitable candidate for the
presidency. But other candidates may emerge, so we want to wait to
make a final decision,'' the Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted him as
saying after a faction meeting.
   Uno announced his resignation after only two months in office
because of the party's heavy losses in elections July 23 for the
upper house of Parliament. Uno also had come under criticism after
allegations he kept paid mistresses.
   Kaifu acknowledged Wednesday he received about $110,000 in
political donations in five years from the Recruit Co., the firm at
the center of a scandal that brought down Uno's predecessor, Noboru
Takeshita.
   But he said the donations were properly reported and that he
received no stock shares from the information and publishing
conglomerate.
   The company allegedly provided millions of dollars in political
contributions and bargain-priced stocks to prominent people to
obtain favors.
   From 1974 to 1976, Kaifu served as deputy chief Cabinet
secretary under the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki. He later also
served as education minister for two periods totaling about two
years.
   Party officials have said the new party leader will serve only
the remainder of Takeshita's original term, which ends Oct. 31. The
party then will hold a new election.

   With the long-range weather forecast calling
for little relief through October, U.S. Forest Service officials
said Thursday the current forest fire season in the West could be
as bad as 1988.
   Extreme to severe fire conditions already exist in most Western
states and the situation is expected to worsen, Allan West, a
Forest Service deputy chief, said at a new conference.
   West said that ``no improvement is expected in the foreseeable
future. Long-range weather forecasts indicate continuing severe
fire conditions, leaving this fire season with the potential to be
as severe as last year's.''
   Last year was the worst fire season since 1910 with major fires
burning through roughly one-third of Yellowstone National Park and
more than 5 million acres scorched nationwide.
   More than 39,400 fires have been reported burning 1.38 million
acres so far this year. That compares with almost 61,200 fires
covering 2.37 million acres through the same time period last year.
   West said that even though the pace of the 1988 fire season was
almost double this year's at the beginning of August, the Forest
Service concerns were prompted by the long-range weather forescasts.
   ``We see no relief through the month of October in precipitation
and temperature,'' he said.
   Since Sunday alone, West said 66 major wildfires in Idaho,
Oregon, California, Washington state and Montana have swept over
220,000 acres destroying about 60 structures and forcing the
evacuation of hundreds of people.
   The worst fires are burning in southern and central Idaho and
eastern Oregon.
   West said that in one recent 24-hour period 1,000
lightning-caused fires were reported in the Boise National Forest.
   West said that large fires such as those that burned through
Yellowstone National Park in 1988 were always a possibility. He
singled out an area including Glacier National Park in northwestern
Montana with ``overmature'' lodgepole pine damaged by insects where
major fires could erupt.
   Extreme fire conditions exist in most of California and Nevada,
large portions of Wyoming and North Dakota, southern Idaho, eastern
Oregon and the Cascade range in both Oregon and Washington state.
   Severe fire conditions exist in Montana, South Dakota, western
Minnesota, central and northern Idaho and throughout the remaining
sections of Washington and Oregon.
   Despite scattered showers and cooler temperatures in some parts
of the West over the past several days, West said the moderation in
weather will do little to reverse the dry conditions.

   Two professional athletes, including one who
said he ``went from stardom to depression and near destruction''
because of drug abuse, urged Congress on Thursday to expand drug
prevention programs.
   ``It is important we start at an early age,'' said Delvin
Williams, who played football for the San Francisco 49ers and the
Miami Dolphins. Williams said he began experimenting with marijuana
in grade school.
   Williams and John Lucas, a veteran guard in the National
Basketball Association, told the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee that drug education programs should stretch from
kindergarten through high school.
   Drugs ``took my dreams and eventually it took my soul,'' Lucas
told the senators. ``I went from stardom to depression and near
destruction. I know firsthand what it means to hit bottom.''
   Lucas described how his daughter at age 6 tried to sniff ashes
through a straw, imitating how her father snorted cocaine.
   ``There are many examples that would frighten most of you, but
it's happening every day,'' he said.
   ``It starts after the game when you lose. It starts after the
game when you win,'' said Williams. ``You think you can handle it,''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the committee, said
the type of prevention programs aimed at youth, which both Lucas
and Williams now participate in, are a critical part of fighting
drugs.
   But Kennedy said prevention, as well as treatment programs, are
badly underfunded, with about three-fourths of the federal drug
money going to law enforcement and interdiction.
   ``It is a political fact of life that law enforcement and
interdiction have an easier time obtaining funds. But we will never
purge our society of drug addiction with a strategy that
shortchanges prevention and treatment,'' Kennedy said. ``The war on
drugs must be waged on all fronts, and that means prevention and
treatment, too.''
   The senator said the Department of Health and Human Services is
getting twice as many approved applications for local prevention
programs as it can fund. The government's commitment to
school-based anti-drug education programs through the Education
Department equals $1 a month per student, he said.
   Keema McAdoo, who is entering her senior year of high school in
the Dorchester section of Boston, has been a peer counselor in
local anti-drug programs for the past 2{ years. In that time, she
said, she has been to 16 funerals of teen-agers who were either
killed by drugs or were drug addicts and committed suicide.
   ``It is time for the schools, churches and businesses to invest
now instead of having to invest later,'' she said.
   On the treatment side, Kennedy said the nation has the capacity
to treat fewer than one of every six drug addicts seeking help.
   New Jersey Public Health Commissioner Molly Coye said there are
an estimated 50,000 intravenous drug users and 150,000 cocaine
users in her state, but treatment funds are available for only
6,000 addicts. There are 3,000 on a waiting list, and she estimated
that the majority of addicts would participate in drug treatment
programs.
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that drug users want treatment,''
Ms. Coye said. ``We simply don't have the resources.''

<HEAD>Soldiers and Guerrillas Celebrate Peace Plan with Hugs, Feast</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghan soldiers and about 700
guerrilla defectors celebrated a peace plan Thursday with hugs,
kisses and the slaughter of sheep in a dusty town in the barren
mountains of western Afghanistan.
   The decision by the local guerrilla force to join the government
marked a gain for President Najib's program of national
reconciliation to end the decade-old civil war.
   But amid the festivities and show of arms there was a noisy
reminder that the war goes on: a rocket exploded behind a clump of
trees 1,500 feet from the crowd, sending up a cloud of brown smoke
as the official ceremony started.
   A few government soldiers disappeared but the speeches went on
and the former guerrillas, defectors from the
Harkat-e-Enquelab-e-Islami fundamentalist group led by Maulvi
Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi, were welcomed into the government fold.
   The Harkat guerrillas already had a three-year informal
cease-fire with the Soviet-backed government. So the official
reconciliation was one of warm embraces and good food _ rocket or
no rocket.
   Hayat Ullah, eldest son of faction commander Ibrahim Beg, blamed
the rival Jamiat-e-Islami for the rocket.
   Beg, sitting cross-legged in the mosque of this tiny town 250
miles west of Kabul, said he lost only ``a few'' men in fighting
against the government. But he said between 200 and 250 of his
fighters have died in clashes with rival guerrilla groups, mainly
Jamiat and hard-line fundamentalist Gulbaddin Hekmatyar's
Hezb-e-Islami.
   He said he has 21,000 supporters, including 900 armed fighters.
Without informing Mohammadi, Beg said, they decided to join the
government after the Feb. 15 withdrawal of the last Soviet troops
in the belief Najib's administration is ``the people's
government,'' not one of infidels.
   ``First, we face shortages of food. Then, we don't have enough
weapons to fight with other groups. So with the cooperation of the
government, we will fight against those who do not believe in
national reconciliation,'' Beg said.
   The guerrillas, some unarmed but about half wearing rifles,
lined up with their heavy weapons, including a rocket-propelled
grenade launcher and two anti-aircraft guns.
   Under the agreement, they keep their weapons and will get
additional ones. One of Beg's younger sons was given five
Kalashnikovs when he and his men marched down the hills into town,
and the town itself received 10 tons of flour and the promise of
more to come.
   Government officials also gave the guerrillas money, but
journalists were unable to find out how much.
   Afghan government forces have their headquarters in the
provincial capital of Chagcharan, 25 miles away, but Hayat Ullah
said no troops came to Taghai Timur until four days ago, when the
guerrillas announced they were ready to join the government.
   The town is in Ghowr, one of Afghanistan's poorest provinces,
whose 250,000 people survive by raising sheep, cattle and wheat.
   Several villagers said the journalists were the first Westerners
they have seen.
   Reporters watched locals in colorful turbans and baggy pants
slaughtering sheep, which a government spokesman described as a
traditional sign of reconciliation.
   Ranking army officers and provincial officials exchanged hugs
and some kisses with waiting guerrillas.
   At a traditional feast of roasted sheep, rice, yogurt and flat
nan bread, some of Beg's followers asked journalists why the
Americans still supply weapons to the guerrillas.
   ``If the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia stop military
assistance, the war will finish in a few days,'' said Aji Mohammad
Yaqub, a bearded man of about 50 who said he has lost 50 friends
and relatives in the war.
   A deputy minister for state security who identified himself as
Lt. Gen. Jalal said that in the past month, 5,000 armed guerrillas
and 10,000 of their unarmed supporters have joined the government.
   He estimated more than 200,000 guerrillas are in Afghanistan,
but said about 70 percent are not fighting.
   This figure matched an estimate by Peter Tomsen, a special U.S.
envoy to the guerrillas. But Tomsen has predicted Najib's
Soviet-backed government will fall and ``the resistance will
prevail.''
   Afghan officials point out they have weathered the Soviet
withdrawal in February, despite similar predictions the guerrillas
would oust them then.

   Less than 10 percent of people at high risk for a
type of infection that can cause pneumonia, meningitis and even
death have ever gotten the vaccine for it, and health officials
Thursday urged doctors to do better.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said 48 million
Americans are at high risk of pneumococcal infections, but a 1985
study found that not one in 10 of them have ever received the
vaccine.
   The vaccine, a one-time-only shot, is recommended for adults 65
and over and for adults with chronic illnesses such as heart and
lung disease, kidney failure, cirrhosis and suppressed immune
systems.
   Pneumococcal infections cause 150,000 to 570,000 cases of
pneumonia and contribute to an estimated 40,000 deaths annually,
the CDC said.
   ``Assuming an overall vaccine efficacy of 60 percent ... an
estimated 12,000 deaths related to pneumococcal disease might be
prevented annually'' if only 60 percent of high-risk people were
vaccinated, the CDC said in its weekly report.
   The CDC praised a two-year California State Department of Health
Services program promoting the use of pneumococcal vaccines. Local
health departments received more than 60,000 doses, and were
encouraged to provide the vaccine during scheduled autumn
flu-vaccine clinics or other health department clinics.
   From July 1986 through July 1987, 56 participating health
departments gave more than 24,000 vaccinations. The following year,
59 participating departments administered more than 44,000
vaccinations.
   The CDC urged health-care providers to give their patients
pneumococcal vaccine along with their other vaccinations whenever
appropriate.

<HEAD>Panel Approves Money to Renovate Vice Presidential Residence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate committee voted Thursday to spend
$200,000 for renovations to Vice President Dan Quayle's official
residence and $125,000 to restore furniture in the living quarters
of the White House.
   The expenditures were approved by voice vote as the Senate
Appropriations Committee sent to the full chamber its version of
the fiscal 1990 spending bill for the Treasury, Postal Service and
a variety of other government agencies.
   The $18 billion spending bill also contains a provision to
prevent the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing Section 89 of
the tax code. Designed to encourage companies to provide health
plans to low-paid employees, the section has been attacked by
businesses that contend compliance is too difficult and costly.
   The money for the vice president's residence, an 1894 Victorian
mansion on the grounds of a U.S. Navy compound in the Embassy Row
section of Washington, would be spent on constructing four new
bedrooms, an office for Mrs. Quayle, three bathrooms and a laundry
room.
   After last year's election, the Quayles said renovations were
needed to accommodate their family with three school-age children.
They said repeatedly they would pay for renovations with private
donations.
   Denise Balzano, Marilyn Quayle's chief of staff, said this week
that $200,000 has been raised and that the money will be used to
buy furniture and other items.
   The House has already approved the $200,000 for the Quayle
residence renovations, but the Senate added the money for the White
House furniture.
   According to the committee, that money would go toward
refurbishing furniture now in storage because it's worn out.
   The spending bill covers a wide range of routine government
programs and projects, including the Treasury and Customs Service,
the Executive Office of the President, and the Postal Service.
   The committee also included a provision in the bill designed to
close a loophole in postal rules. Some credit card issuers have
teamed up with charitable organizations in making their
solicitations and have thus benefitted from subsidized mail rates,
and the committee language would attempt to end subsidies in those
cases.

   Forensic experts who have examined the
videotape purporting to show the body of Lt. Col. William R.
Higgins believe it shows evidence ``inconsistent'' with a person
who has just been hanged, an administration official said Thursday.
   Other experts said in interviews that the body shown on the
videotape appears to be that of a man who had been dead for a
while, not someone who was killed on Monday as the kidnappers
claimed.
   A group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on
Earth sent the 30-second videotape to a news organization in
Beirut, saying the American Marine was killed in retaliation for
Israel's kidnapping of a Shiite Moslem cleric in Lebanon.
   The gruesome tape showed a crew-cut man, with a noose around his
neck, blindfolded, his ankles and arms bound. The tape had been
reproduced several times by the time it was given to experts in
Washington, and the quality was grainy and unfocused, officials say.
   ``No one can say for sure, but there are many things there
inconsistent with a man who has just been hanged,'' said one
official who spoke only on condition he not be named. He declined
to elaborate.
   Another official said experts who viewed the tape noted the
body's shoulders appeared rigid rather than slumped, as they would
probably have been on a man who died by hanging, and the heavy
clothing was inconsistent with Lebanon's summer heat.
   Pathologists will probably not know for sure whether the body is
that of Higgins, when he died, or how, unless the body can be
recovered. A U.N. envoy arrived in Beirut Thursday to search for
the body.
   Michael Baden, Director of Forensic Sciences for New York State
Police, said that despite the poor quality of the tape experts
should be able to study individual frames and determine whether it
is Higgins or not.
   For instance, he said, there is a clear shot of the left ear
lobe which is a distinctive identification mark for pathologists.
   Baden said the body in the videotape does not look bloated,
suggesting either it was kept refrigerated or the tape was shot
within 12 hours of death.
   U.S. authorities have been hampered by the lack of reliable
intelligence information about Higgins and the other eight American
hostages believed held in Lebanon. Some reports have said the U.N.
peacekeeper was killed soon after he was kidnapped in south Lebanon
in February 1988, or in retaliation for the U.S. downing of an
Iranian jetliner last December.
   Werner Spitz, a professor of forensic medicine at Wayne State
University in Michigan, said that as soon as he saw the tape on
television, ``I said to myself, `This body is not fresh.'''
   Spitz, formerly the Detroit medical examiner, said the skin
appeared dry and discolored. ``That would be consistent with a body
that has been dead a while and has undergone mummification,
especially in a hot climate,'' he said.
   Other experts have noted the videotape indicates the man's
tongue was not hanging out, the eyes were not bulging, and the face
and neck did not appear to have turned dark _ all characteristics
of death by hanging. Baden suggested this indicates the man was
dead before being placed on the gallows.
   But Spitz and Baden both said the absence of those conditions
does not prove conclusively the victim was not hanged.

<TEXT>
   The heating bill is unpaid, there's
controversy over those chosen to help run the joint, and
consultants may be spending money that doesn't exist.
   Worst, the state probably doesn't have its share of the
estimated $72 million needed to convert 750,000 square feet of
abandoned factory into the world's largest contemporary art museum.
The state's deepening money troubles have left it without cash to
pay for schools, police and other services.
   Still, boosters of the planned Massachusetts Museum of
Contemporary Art are pushing ahead.
   Pending the results of a $1.25 million feasibility study, Gov.
Michael S. Dukakis, one of the project's earliest backers, remains
committed to it, press aide Susan Kaplan said Thursday.
   ``It is going to be a big boost for northern Berkshire County,''
she said.
   Dukakis has maintained that the town needs the museum and its
estimated 600 jobs to revive its economy. North Adams' unemployment
rate is just 4 percent, but it has little industry and most people
have to seek work in other towns.
   Supporters claim the museum could attract 150,000 visitors
annually to the remote mill town of 18,000, located in the state's
northwestern corner more than a three-hour drive from art-lovers in
Boston and four hours from New York.
   The unlikely project was the brainchild of Thomas Krens, former
director of the Williams College Art Museum, who shortly after
launching the project was named director of the Guggenheim Museum
in New York.
   Ties between the private museum and an international committee
headed by Krens to review the feasibility study have come under
question. Although they have denied any conflict of interest,
committee member Carmen Gimenez, former director of national
exhibitions for the Ministry of Culture of Spain, was recently
hired by Krens as a curator of 20th century art at the Guggenheim.
   The $72 million would go to convert the dingy 28-building
manufacturing complex into at least 380,000 square feet of
exhibition space for environmental art works and other contemporary
sculptures too large for most museums.
   Among the works promised to the museum are abstract sculptures
more than 20 feet high in such non-traditional materials as neon
tubing and scrap metal.
   Count Giuseppe Panza, an Italian industrialist who has an
extensive collection of American art from the 1960s and 1970s, has
agreed to lend many works to the museum. The German Architecture
Museum in Frankfurt plans to send much of its collection of modern
architectural drawings and models.
   The $35 million state share of the cost would come from
borrowing spread over two to four years, Kaplan said. The remainder
is to come from private donations.
   But so far, only the state has come up with any cash and that's
fast disappearing. At the end of June, only about $170,000 was left
out of a $1.7 million state appropriation to hire staff of six and
pay for the $1.25 million feasibility study.
   The study, split among nearly 50 outside consultants charging up
to $300 an hour, was to have been completed last month. It is now
expected to be finished in September, according to Joseph C.
Thompson, executive planning director of the museum project.
   ``Six weeks is not that late,'' Thompson said. ``We are working
as quickly as possible, but we've been delayed by the number of
reports and the fairly astounding types of technical analysis and
engineering studies required.'' Topics that have to be studied
range from the heating and ventilating system to art installation
and transportation, he said.
   Thompson said the group has not begun private fund-raising,
although its quarterly financial report lists a net take of $13,000
from a $46,000 ball last winter, $15,000 in donations from local
supporters and a $100,000 loan due in January from the state
Industrial Finance Agency.
   ``It's all about timing,'' he said, maintaining the feasibility
studies include a blueprint for fund-raising.
   He was equally vague about what the museum is doing about an
overdue $175,000 heating bill. Berkshire Gas Co. spokesman
Christopher Farrell said that after carrying the unpaid heating
bill for the buildings through the winter, the utility cut off
service in March.
   Thompson said the state grant does not include operating
expenses. And he declined to say how the museum planned to pay the
bill or what it would do this winter.
   ``We didn't apply for grants for it. We will raise the money.
That's all the comment I will have about it,'' Thompson said.

<HEAD>Judge Says Mosbacher Must Protect Turtles By Monday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday told the Commerce
Department to protect endangered sea turtles from Gulf Coast
fishermen by Monday or face an order forcing shrimpers to use
protective devices they detest.
   If Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher fails to meet the Monday
deadline for protective measures, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan
said he would grant a request of the National Wildlife Federation
to order the department to enforce its suspended regulations
requiring turtle excluder devices, TEDs, on shrimp nets.
   Hogan issued those instructions in an oral ruling from the bench
after a hearing on the federation's request. Federation attorney
Jan Goldman-Carter said, ``It's not entirely clear what the judge
is ordering'' but it was clear the department had to have
``something in place by Monday.''
   ``We intend to submit regulations for publication by next Monday
which would permit shrimpers to either limit their trawl times or
use TEDs,'' the department said in a statement.
   ``Mosbacher's decision Monday is a true litmus test for the Bush
administration's commitment to this nation's environmental agenda
and the Endangered Species Act,'' said Tom Miller, a spokesman for
the Center for Marine Conservation.
   Shrimpers, contending that use of turtle excluder devices
reduces their catch by up to one-third, last month blocked shipping
channels along the Texas Gulf Coast and threatened violence against
law enforcement agents to protest new regulations requiring use of
the excluder devices.
   On July 24, Mosbacher suspended enforcement of the regulations
and said that after 45 days, shrimpers would be required to pull up
their nets every 90 minutes. Experts say most turtles can survive
that long without coming up for air.
   Mosbacher has since proposed regulations that would require
shrimpers to pull their nets every 105 minutes. Spokesman Brian
Gorman said the agency had not yet determined what interval would
be required in Monday's proposal.
   Hogan said turtles have been left ``totally abandoned by the
secretary,'' said Hogan, who ruled that Mosbacher's decision
appears to ``fly in the face'' of a congressional mandate that
several species of turtle be protected by May 1.
   Congress required that excluder devices be used, but gave
Mosbacher authority to modify the requirement for good cause. The
federation contends Mosbacher has not shown good cause.
   Environmentalists say 11,000 turtles die each year in shrimp
nets and that the excluder devices _ basically hinged boxes
attached to the net _ hurt the catch only minimally.
   Protecting sea turtles from shrimpers has been at issue for
nearly two decades. Congress, Hogan said, acted ``after years and
years of study and thousands upon thousands upon thousands of hours
to determine the best method to preserve these species.''
   And while Atlantic Coast shrimper fishermen have successfully
used the devices, Hogan said it is regrettable Texas and Louisiana
shrimpers ``cannot find it possible'' to use the devices even for a
season.
   The Wildlife Federation argued that restricting tow times is not
nearly as effective as the use of excluder devices.
   While 3 percent of turtles caught will die if excluder devices
are used, raising nets after 90 minutes means a mortality rate of
at least 4.4 percent, the federation said.
   Government attorney Michelle Kuruc said Mosbacher suspended the
regulations after the protests because ``he felt the tempers were
too high to propose an alternative strategy.''
   ``We're not talking about rocket scientists. We're taking about
a lot of seamen who don't feel they're getting a fair shake with
these regulations,'' said Robert McManus, attorney for the
Concerned Shrimpers of America.

<HEAD>Space Probe Finds Three More Moons Orbiting Neptune</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ANTCZAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three new moons were discovered around
Neptune by cameras on the Voyager 2 space probe as it hurtled
toward the blue planet, Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists said
Thursday.
   The discoveries bring the number of known Neptune moons to six,
including long-known Triton and Nereid and a moon found earlier
this summer by Voyager.
   Voyager 2 was 22 million miles from Neptune when the moons were
confirmed by scientists Wednesday, indicating there may be many
more discoveries as the space probe draws closer in the next few
weeks.
   Finding the moons may presage discovery of narrow rings around
Neptune similar to those around Saturn. That is because the moons
are orbiting in a region where rings are thought to exist, said
Richart Terrile, one of the team of scientists studying images
transmitted by Voyager.
   ``The whole ring arc idea has it that satellites will be in
association with the rings, and the fact we're seeing the moons
already is encouraging,'' Richard Terrile, using a term for partial
rings.
   The new moons were temporarily named 1989 N2, 1989 N3 and 1989
N4. The objects were spotted in images from Voyager's TV cameras
and tracked for five days. They were confirmed as moons when they
followed predicted orbits.
   The trio appear to range between 60 miles and 125 miles in
diameter and are in circular, equatorial orbits moving in the same
direction as Neptune's rotation. Triton, for unknown reasons,
orbits in the opposite direction.
   Voyager 2 was launched in 1977 and has explored Jupiter, Saturn
and Uranus. Now 2.7 billion miles from Earth, it is heading at more
than 42,000 mph on a course to pass within 3,000 miles of Neptune
on Aug. 24.
   The number of discoveries at such a great distance from Neptune
suggests more finds are likely, according to Terrile, 38, a 10-year
Voyager project veteran who is among two dozen members of the
imaging team.
   ``At this time in the last encounter, Uranus, we had only found
one moon. I think the fact that we found four now bodes well for
finding more,'' he said.
   The moons may shed light on how Neptune formed. Neptune has a
large atmosphere and little is known about what its core is made of
and what is going on in there.
   Moons can provide a sample of material from a planet, or be
material captured by it, Terrile said.
   ``A planet just normally doesn't form by itself, it leaves
behind debris,'' he said, adding that the debris can be in the form
of moons or rings.
   Study of moons can also tell scientists about such events as
heating, collisions and geological activity in the solar system.
``The moons have on them, since they are surfaces, an imprinted
history of what's gone on,'' Terrile said.
   For the moment, the discoveries raise more questions than
answers. If there is a ring system, is it regular or irregular?
   ``We know very little about what's there, yet we're plunging a
spacecraft right through the system,'' Terrile said.
   Scientists believe Voyager 2 is in a fairly safe position, he
said, but if there is an irregular system ``we might find that it's
a rather hazardous place to fly the spacecraft through.''
   The newfound moons were only points of light on the images, but
the resolution will improve about 5 percent each of the next 10
days and then improve by 10 percent a day, Terrile said.
   Of the three, 1989 N3 is closest to Neptune, orbiting 17,000
miles above the planet's clouds and completing one orbit every 8
hours and 10 minutes.
   Orbiting 23,300 miles above the clouds, 1989 N4 circles Neptune
in 10 hours and 20 minutes; 1989 N2 is 30,000 miles above the
clouds and completes each orbit in 13 hours and 30 minutes.
   Voyager 2 spotted the first new moon, 1989 N1, on June 21 and
tracked it until confirmation in July.

   Following is the full text of the Arabic
statement issued by the Revolutionary Justice Organization,
suspending the killing of American hostage Joseph James Cicippio.
It was translated by The Associated Press bureau in Beirut:
   In the name of the almighty God,
   We would have wished a failure of diplomacy in order to execute
the spy Cicippio and drag the United States into the trap to
humiliate it anew and to remind it of the events of the year '83.
But out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states
with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, we
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its substitution
with an initiative.
   If any initiative would resolve the affair and reveal the
intentions and intrigues of the Zionist imperialism, then the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, the vanguard of humanitarian
initiatives, declares the following intiative:
   1. The release of Sheik (Abdul Karim) Obeid and a number of the
strugglers of the Palestinian intefadah and the heroes of the
Lebanese resistance against the Israeli occupation. The numbers and
lists of their names are to be prepared later and presented to the
Red Cross.
   2. Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise the
initiative will be considered canceled.
   Victory to the downtrodden in the liberation march,
   Justice, glory and immortality to the martyrs,
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization.

<HEAD>Very Widely Scattered Thunderstorms; Much of Nation Fair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Showers and thunderstorms were widely scattered across the
nation Thursday with mostly light rain, and much of the nation had
fair weather.
   The remains of Hurricane Chantal, centered over west-central
Missouri, produced showers and thunderstorms there and in eastern
Kansas.
   To the north, showers and thunderstorms developed in warm,
unstable air ahead of a cold front stretching from southeastern
South Dakota into northwestern Wisconsin.
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms were widely scattered in the Tennessee
Valley, south-central Texas, and Florida.
   No site reported more than an inch of rain during the six hours
up to 2 p.m. EDT.
   In the Atlantic, Hurricane Dean veered away from the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico and wandered toward the west-northwest,
with hurricane watches posted for the Turks and Caicos islands of
the Bahama chain.
   A large upper-air high-pressure system centered over western
Kentucky carried warm and humid weather from the Gulf Coast to the
Great Lakes.
   Marquette, Mich., reached a record high of 88. In Florida,
Apalachicola hit a record 95.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 101 at Needles, Calif. Thursday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 30 at Truckee, Calif.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from sections of the middle and upper Mississippi Valley across the
Ohio Valley and the Great Lakes to the northern Atlantic Coast.
Showers and thunderstorms also were forecast from the eastern half
of the Gulf Coast region into Florida.
   Highs in the 60s and 70s were predicted along the Pacific Coast;
in the 80s from inland sections of the Pacific Northwest across the
northern Rockies, the upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes
to northern New England; above 100 over the desert Southwest,
inland valleys of central and southern California, and near the Big
Bend of the Rio Grande in Texas; and in the 90s across much of the
rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Who's Minding the Mint? Employees Arrested for Illegally Printing
Bills</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employees at the national mint
made illegal copies of Argentina's currency and government bonds in
a scheme that may have netted millions of dollars, officials said
Thursday.
   Economy Minister Nestor Rapanelli said it was too soon to give
an estimate of how much money was involved.
   In a radio interview, Vice President Eduardo Duhalde said the
bills and bonds are illegal duplicates but not counterfeit. He said
they are legal currency.
   Six people were being questioned, including Eduardo Alejandro
Petronzi, director of the mint's chemical lab. No charges were
immediately filed, according to Carlos Branca, a federal judge.
   The alleged fraud, which was discovered earlier this year, may
have begun as far back as 1987, Branca said. He said the state
intelligence service and the federal police were investigating.
   The independent news agency Diarios y Noticias, citing
unidentified government sources, said mint employees stole paper
and chemicals, and simply printed additional copies of legitimite
bills and bonds.
   The scheme came to light when different provincial bonds bearing
the same certification numbers were discovered.
   Newspapers carried the story on front pages Thursday. Financial
markets did not react sharply.

<HEAD>Two Inmates on Hunger Strike Die; Beating Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANKARA, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers said Thursday that prison
guards beat to death two Kurdish prisoners who had been on a hunger
strike. Officials said the inmates died of dehydration as a result
of their fasts.
   According to accounts in Turkish newspapers, the prisoners,
members of the outlawed Kurdish Labor Party, were beaten with clubs
and guns during a fight that broke out Wednesday in the
high-security Aydin prison.
   The newspapers said the violence began when prison authorities
refused to provide medical care for fasting inmates and the
prisoners began protesting. It said four prisoners were injured.
   The Anatolia news agency quoted the prosecutor in Aydin, Nural
Ucurum, as saying prisoners attacked guards when the guards told
the inmates to strip for a medical examination.
   Ucurum said the two prisoners were not injured in the fight and
that an autopsy showed they died of dehydration after refusing food
for 35 days.
   Ucurum also said that four fasting prisoners were hospitalized,
but he said it was because of a hunger strike, not because of
injuries sustained in the prison clash.
   The Justice Ministry identified the dead men as Mehmet
Yalcinkaya, 27, and Husnu Eroglu, 30. The Kurdish Labor Party seeks
to set up a Marxist state in parts of eastern and southeastern
Turkey.

<HEAD>Warner Calls for Repeal of His Radiation Amendment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The author of a law that effectively denied a
day in court to victims of radiation exposure from government
testing on Thursday urged that the law be repealed.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., told the Judiciary Committee's
Subcommittee on Courts and Administratve Practice his amendment to
the 1985 Defense Authorization bill was intended to help, not harm
veterans and civilian workers who had been exposed to radiation in
atomic weapons testing.
   ``However, what resulted was an unexpected dismissal of hundreds
of damage suits brought by those affected,'' said Warner.
   ``Let me repeat, that this was a completely unexpected and
inadvertent result,'' he said.
   Warner's bill allowed defense contractors to have the government
replace them as defendants in any suits brought by those who worked
or lived near nuclear testing sites.
   The amendment, called Section 1631, also placed all radiation
victim cases under the Federal Tort Claims Act, which granted the
government certain immunities based on national security and
defense concerns and denied exposure victims a trial by jury.
   Warner joined Nevada Democratic Sens. Harry Reid and Richard
Bryan in urging passage of the Radiation Victims Fair Treatment Act
to repeal the earlier legislation he sponsored.
   ``If this bill were to become law, the litigant would still have
to prove that the defendant was negligent,'' said Warner. ``But as
the law stands these veterans can't even have the opportunity to
have a trial before a jury of their peers.''
   Thomas R. Thomsen of AT&amp;T Technology Systems and James S. Kane
of the University of California's Office of Laboratory Affairs
urged the subcommittee not to repeal the law because, they said, it
rightfully made the government responsible for its weapons testing
program.
   They also argued the proposed repeal would flood the nation's
court system with new cases that could take years to resolve.

<TEXT>
   Reports from all 93 U.S. attorneys outlining
the structure of drug-trafficking organizations reflect that the
nation's heartland is suffering, with killers hired even in rural
Iowa to dispose of informants, officials said Thursday.
   ``At the outset, we knew that the country was awash in narcotics
and dangerous drugs, but we did not expect to find significant
cocaine operations, for example, in Wyoming, or heroin trafficking
in Iowa,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a news conference.
   The report, which named 43 drug-trafficking organizations
ranging from the Medellin cartel to the Hell's Angels motorcycle
gang, divulged information only on completed investigations and
prosecutions, not ongoing projects.
   U.S. Attorney Charles W. Larson of the Northern District of Iowa
said, ``Ironically, it seems to be proportionally as bad there for
us as anywhere. Although we have very, very few disenfranchised
people in a state such as Iowa, we still have more than our fair
share of drugs.''
   Larson recounted the story of an Iowa farmer who was arrested
several years ago ``running out his back door with a kilo of
cocaine under his arm and no clothes.''
   Larson said the drug trafficking _ done mainly by Iowans who
have moved to states on the nation's borders or who have friends in
those states _ has bred increasing violence in the state, including
``three or four cases that involved hired killers.''
   ``One drug dealer was going to have an informant killed, hired
two people to come down from Minnesota,'' he said. ``Unfortunately,
they were going to kill the wrong informant, but fortunately, we
stemmed that, literally in the parking lot.
   ``To give you an idea of how violent they can become, they had
taken steps to rent a woodchipper to dispose of the body once they
had killed him,'' Larson said.
   In three years, the Northern District of Iowa's federal
Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force has prosecuted and sent
to prison more than 200 people for drug crimes, including heroin
trafficking.
   Thornburgh said the compilation _ prepared for President Bush
and for William J. Bennett, the director of the Office of National
Drug Control Policy _ might help develop a national drug control
strategy, which is due Sept. 5.
   ``What we have found is that these crime conglomerates operate
with various degrees of structure and sophistication,'' he said.
``They include highly publicized international operations such as
the Colombia Medellin cartel as well as other groups operating on a
regional basis such as the Dixie Mafia based in Georgia and the
Miami Boys gang in Florida.
   ``A common denominator of these organizations, however, is greed
_ their relentless pursuit of money,'' Thornburgh said.
   `` ... One of the salient features of this report is the
changing nature of organized crime in this country,'' he said. ``No
longer are we talking about the traditional organized crime
families only. We're talking about new organizations, the Crips and
the Bloods, Asian organizations, the Jamaican posses, the
motorcycle gangs.''
   Bennett, in an interview after the news conference, said he
really didn't learn anything new from the report.
   ``I've educated myself about this beforehand and I knew about
these operations, but I think it's very interesting to see the
extent of these investigations, that they extend all over the
country, that the stereotype _ just big urban areas _ is mistaken,
that crack is everywhere, and that we're making some progress,''
Bennett said.

<HEAD>Burma Plans to Ease Martial Law, Open Schools</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling military council will reopen
some schools closed after last year's pro-democracy protests and
plans gradually to relax martial law, state media reported Thursday.
   Officials closed all schools in June 1988, during student-led
mass demonstrations against authoritarian rule.
   Radio Rangoon said Thursday junior high schools will reopen Aug.
14 and teacher training colleges on Aug. 21.
   Primary schools reopened on June 19.
   The Working People's Daily said high schools and universities
will reopen soon ``since the general law and order situation in the
country has improved considerably.''
   It quoted a government directive issued Wednesday to military
commanders and government officials in various states.
   The directive also told regional military commanders to take
``severe action'' against people who violate martial law.
   Burma has been under martial law since Sept. 18, when army
commander Gen. Saw Maung's troops crushed the pro-democracy
movement.
   On July 18, authorities increased the power of regional military
commanders and empowered military tribunuals to sentence martial
law violators to death.
   The directive says commanders ``are required to strive to
restore the normal situation.''
   ``With the progress in the enforcement of the rule of law,
martial law will be lifted step by step.''
   It repeats government pledges to hold free and fair elections
next year, the state newspaper said Thursday.
   Doubts about this pledge increased after opposition party
leaders Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo were arrested on July 20 and
confined to their homes under military guard.
   Rangoon-based Western diplomats reached by telephone from
Bangkok said Ms. Suu Kyi, 44, has taken only water since the first
day of detention. The government denies she is on a hunger strike
and no reports have emerged about her condition.
   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she
wants a transfer to Insein Jail to be with other detained political
activists.
   Diplomats reported a wave of arrests of opposition party members
in the past two weeks.
   It coincides with a government amnesty for common criminals.
Officials said Thursday that 17,558 have been freed since the
amnesty was announced July 20.
   The amnesty covers offenses committed before the Sept. 18
military takeover and does not apply to martial law violations.

   An explosion ripped through a small London hotel
Thursday, killing one person _ who apparently was responsible for
the blast _ and seriously damaging the five-story building, police
said.
   Buildings neighboring the Beverly House Hotel in central London
were evacuated and dogs searched the wrecked structure for any
further explosives, police said.
   It was not immediately clear what caused the explosion, but a
spokesman at Scotland Yard said the blast was believed to have
occurred in the room where the victim had been staying.
   Commander George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's
Anti-terrorist Squad, said the dead man was ``apparently
responsible'' for the explosion.
   Police said the dead man was of Middle Eastern origin but would
not release his identity. He was reported to have stayed for
several days in a fourth-floor room in the 18-room hotel.
   His body was found wedged between the second and third floors of
the hotel, police said.

   The Supreme Soviet on Thursday confirmed the first
Cabinet member who is not a member of the Communist Party, a
biologist who will grapple with the country's ecological problems.
   The national legislature also approved for a Cabinet post a
regional Communist Party chief who last year shocked a party
conference by demanding that longtime Kremlin leaders such as
Andrei A. Gromyko retire.
   The Tass news agency said Nikolai Vorontsov, a 55-year-old
professor and biologist, was confirmed as head of the State
Committee for Nature Conservation. He replaced Fyodor Morgun.
   It was not clear why Morgun was not nominated again for the post.
   The legislature also confirmed Vladimir I. Melnikov, 54, as
lumber minister, and Leonid Filimonov, a 54-year-old engineer, as
oil and gas minister, according to Tass.
   Nikolai Rusak, 55, was confirmed as head of the state Sports
Committee, and Viktor Gerashchenko, 52, was chosen to head the
state bank, the news agency said.
   Although the Communist Party and government are separate, in the
past it has been impossible for anyone to rise in the government
structure without solid party credentials.
   Vorontsov's selection indicated that Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov
and the legislature now are willing to look outside the
20-million-member party for government officials.
   Tass said Vorontsov told legislators he favors mandatory
ecological impact studies before the construction of new factories
and giving the needs of the local population priority over the
demands of national ministries.
   During the two-month legislative session, which ends Saturday,
the government announced it is quadrupling the environmental
protection budget for the next 15 years to $612 billion.
   Melnikov, the new lumber minister, promised the Supreme Soviet
he would pay particular attention to ecological problems, Tass said.
   Melnikov shocked last summer's party conference by stating
publicly that longtime Kremlin figures such as former President
Gromyko and Politburo member Mikhail S. Solomentsev should retire.
   Less than six months later, both were removed from the
Politburo. Gromyko died last month.

<HEAD>Panel OKs Bill to Cut Appropriation for Congressional Mail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee approved
legislation Thursday that would reduce the amount of money Congress
is expected to spend next year on mail.
   The nearly $2 billion fiscal 1990 spending bill for Congress
earmarks $80 million for lawmakers' postage, compared to $124.7
million in the bill the House approved earlier this week.
   Official congressional mail expenses in the current fiscal year,
which ends Oct. 1, are expected to be $53.9 million. However,
members of Congress often feel a greatly increased need to
communicate with their constituents in even-numbered, or election,
years.
   ``It provides plenty of money for what is needed to keep in
touch with our constituents,'' said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.,
chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on the legislative
branch.
   ``We have to get after the mail monster and get it under control
or it is going to eat us out of house and home,'' said Reid, who is
not up for election next year.
   The Senate, which has 100 members, would allocate $32 million
for its mailings and $48 million for the House, which has 435
voting members.
   The Senate bill would set a variety of new rules for
congressional mass mailings, reducing from 6 to 2 per year those
that go to all ``postal patrons'' in a district. Lawmakers who
exceed individual mail allowances would have to make up the
difference from their individual allowances.
   The House voted to cut postal patron mailings from 6 to 4, but
left a loophole so members could still advertise their town
meetings.
   Congressional franking privileges are frequently the target of
political reformers, who claim they help incumbents stay in office
at public expense.
   The legislative spending bill is commonly an arena for
House-Senate battles.
   The Senate in its bill stripped out a House-passed provision to
take away from senators the private ``hideaway'' offices they keep
in the Capitol.
   The Senate also would establish an Office of Senate Health
Promotion _ which would run exercise classes and similar services
for senators and their staffs.

<HEAD>Suit Argues State is Illegally Jailing Inmate's Fetus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer has filed suit contending
the state is illegally imprisoning a female inmate's fetus, citing
Missouri's anti-abortion law that says life begins at conception.
   ``If life begins at conception, then fetuses are supposed to be
like anyone else _ they're a person and they have constitutional
rights,'' Michael Box said Thursday in a telephone interview from
Oak Grove.
   Along with declaring that life begins at conception, the
preamble to Missouri's anti-abortion law, key portions of which
were upheld last month by the U.S. Supreme Court, extends to the
unborn ``all the rights, privileges and immunities available to
other persons.''
   ``I'm not pro-choice or pro-life or any of that stuff. But I
think there's some problems with the law and courts are eventually
going to have to rule on it,'' he said.
   Box filed suit earlier this week in federal court in Jefferson
City on behalf of Lovetta Farrar's unborn child.
   The suit on behalf of the fetus contends it has been imprisoned
at the Chillicothe Correctional Center without having been charged
with a crime, allowed an attorney, convicted or sentenced.
   It is also being denied adequate diet, medical care and ``the
opportunity to develop into a healthy live born'' child because of
conditions at the prison, the suit said. All are violations of
constitutional rights, the suit said.
   Box filed a companion suit that contends the prison violated
Farrar's constitutional rights by failing to provide her with a
proper diet, medical care, exercise and a safe environment in which
to carry the fetus.
   Farrar's baby is due in November, according to the suit.
   Prison officials said Farrar's release date is June 1991. She
was serving a three-year sentence for various counts of forgery and
stealing when she was released in February to an honor center. When
she failed to return from a work release program in April, she was
returned to prison.
   Named as defendants in the fetus' suit are Gov. John Ashcroft,
Attorney General William Webster and five senior officials of the
state Department of Corrections and Human Resources. All but
Webster are named in Farrar's suit.
   Gail Hughes, deputy director of the Corrections Department, said
he did not know about the suits.
   The one on behalf of the fetus is ``particularly interesting,''
Hughes said. ``I don't know about that idea.''
   Regarding the challenge to the conditions at the prison in
Chillicothe, he said: ``I think we've had suits like them and won
them all.
   ``Early to bed, early to rise, three meals a day, no alcohol or
drugs is probably a conducive environment to pregnancy,'' he said.
Pregnant inmates ``haven't had any difficulties brought about by
any cause of their incarceration.''

<HEAD>Medical Examiner Says Bones In Bundy Search Are Those Of Deer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bones found in a search of an area where
serial killer Ted Bundy claimed to have buried a victim are those
of deer or coyotes, the state medical examiner says.
   Medical Examiner Todd Grey examined the bones Wednesday and
found they weren't human.
   They were found during a search last weekend in which dozens of
Sanpete County deputies scoured sites in a 60-mile area.
   The latest search and several others aimed at finding the
remains of Debi Kent, a 17-year-old from the town of Bountiful whom
Bundy said he kidnapped in 1974. Bones turned up in past searches
also were those of animals. Sanpete authorities said no more
searches are planned.
   Bundy confessed to killing Ms. Kent and another woman and
claimed responsibility for six other slayings in Utah shortly
before his execution in Florida in January for the murder of a
schoolgirl.
   Investigators have said Bundy was suspected in dozens of
killings in several states, including Utah, where he once attended
law school.

<HEAD>Diplomacy Preceded Decision To Spare Cicippio</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Hostages Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The decision by Shiite Moslem leaders to spare
the life of American hostage Joseph Cicippio followed an intense
U.S. diplomatic effort to gain cooperation from many countries,
including some long-standing U.S. adversaries.
   In addition, private experts said the Revolutionary Justice
Organization, the pro-Iranian group holding Cicippio, also may have
reached their decision to suspend the death sentence after deciding
Cicippio was worth more alive than dead.
   For days, U.S. diplomats were in contact with countries which
had either access to or influence with Iran, the country whose lead
the Lebanese Shiites follow.
   Perhaps carried along by the international outcry that followed
the reported hanging on Monday of Lt. Col. William Higgins, both
Syria and the Soviet Union made diplomatic appeals on Cicippio's
behalf.
   But the apparent intervention by Iran's leadership, U.S.
officials said, may have been decisive. Iran's new president, Ali
Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, expressed regret Tuesday over the
reported death of Higgins and condemned terrorist acts in general.
   A shift in Iran's suppoort for international terrorism could
eventually lead to steps toward an accommodation between the two
one-time allies, American officials have said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Iran
had been the target of an intense U.S. diplomatic campaign that
included a variety of channels.
   ``At this time we have no reason to believe that Iran is not
dealing with this matter in a serious way,'' she said, speaking
less than two hours before the announcement of Cicippio's reprieve.
   But officials cautioned Cicippio and the remaining seven
American hostages still face danger. They noted the Revolutionary
Justice Organization statement did not drop its demand that Israel
free Shiek Abdul Karim Obeid, the Shiite cleric kidnapped last
Friday by Israeli commandos.
   The statement said acceptance of the demand ``should be
announced within days, otherwise the initiative will be considered
canceled.'' This implied the death sentence for Cicippio would be
reimposed.
   Still, announcement of the reprieve lowered the temperature here
considerably. A sense of anxiety had permeated the administration
since Monday when Higgins' execution was announced and was followed
quickly by the announcement that Cicippio would be next.
   The execution of Cicippio, officials said, almost certainly
would have triggered a response by President Bush, possibly
including military action. This, in turn, would have polarized
factions in the Middle East even more.
   Geoffrey Kemp, a National Security Council official in the
Reagan administration, attributed the repreive partly to the
realization by the Revolutionary Justice Organization that any
leverage they believe Ciccipio gives them would have died with his
execution.
   ``He's not worth anything dead,'' said Kemp. He suggested the
organization had to take seriously the views of Iranian officials
who want to renew relationships with the United States.

<HEAD>Future President's Career Goes From Seminary, Jail To Presidential
Palace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER McFARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaime Paz Zamora, all but assured of
becoming Bolivia's next president, is a former seminary student who
began his political career opposing former dictator Hugo Banzer
Suarez, who jailed him in the early 1970's.
   Today, the erstwhile opponents have joined together to form a
new government.
   Paz Zamora, 50, is expected to be elected president by Congress
Friday or Saturday and sworn in as Bolivia's 77th president Sunday.
The former vice president came in third in the May 7 presidential
elections but received the support of Banzer Suarez, the
second-place winner, to gain enough congressional votes to be
elected president.
   Paz Zamora is the son of an army general and a mother from a
prominant aristocratic family. He is the nephew of President Victor
Paz Estenssoro.
   After completing his high school at a Jesuit school in his
hometown of Sucre, he attended a Roman Catholic seminary in
Argentina but quit before he was ordained a priest. He received a
bachelor's degree in philosophy in Cordoba, Argentina.
   He continued his studies in Belgium where he began his political
involvement. Upon his return in 1971, he founded the Revolutionary
Movement of the Left, which opposed Gen. Banzer Suarez.
   Paz Zamora was arrested in February 1974 along with hundreds of
other political figures but was released five months later and
exiled to Venezuela.
   His resistance to the Banzer regime continued from exile and
after his return in 1977. He participated in the 1978 presidential
elections, the results of which were nullified due to widespread
fraud.
   During the 1980 presidential campaign, a private plane carrying
Paz Zamora and four other candidates crashed near La Paz. Paz
Zamora was the only surviver and suffered severe burns. He was
rushed to the United States for treatment and his face and hands
still show scars from the suspicious crash.
   In the 1979 and 1980 presidential elections he was candidate for
vice-president as part of the Popular and Democratic Unity
Coalition. The coalition won the largest number of votes in the
1980 elections but was prevented from taking office due to a bloody
military coup headed by Gen. Luis Garcia Meza.
   Paz Zamora was in the United States during the coup but members
of his party and coalition were arrested, persecuted or killed by
armed civilians and soldiers. On Jan. 15, 1981, 11 leaders of Paz
Zamora's party were meeting at a private home when paramilitary and
soldiers attacked. All but one of the leaders were brutally
tortured and killed.
   In response to domestic political and labor as well as
international opposition, military rulers stepped down and Congress
elected Hernan Siles Zuazo president and Paz Zamora vice president
in 1982.
   Within months of taking over the banrkupt economy, the coalition
split and Paz Zamora's party left the government. Within his party,
the more radical leftist leaders broke away in response to tough
austerity measures dictated by the government in an effort to
control an inflation rate that reached 24,000 percent by 1985.
   While Siles Zuazo and Paz Zamora were slated to remain in office
until 1986, serious social unrest and economic difficulties led to
early elections in 1985.
   Paz Zamora's party, weakened by internal rivalries, only won 8
percent of the vote in 1985 elections.
   In 1987, Paz Zamora's party, however, won second place in
nationwide municipal elections with 26 percent of the vote. By
then, the Marxist tendency within the party gave way to a more
pragmatic approach that tried to capture votes from the center.
   Paz Zamora supports a free market economy, flexible exchange
rates and economic stability. He now considers himself a
nationalist leftist with ties to the the European social democratic
movement and the international socialists.
   He differs, however, with the government's current economic
model because he favors greater protection for national industries,
programs to reactivate the economy and greater expenditures for
health and education.
   He is divorced and has two teenage sons.

<HEAD>Study: Nonsmokers in Danger of Lung Cancer if Exposed to Radon</HEAD>

   Nonsmoking uranium miners died of lung cancer
from breathing decaying radon far more often than the rest of the
nonsmoking population, confirming the radioactive gas is a potent
cause of cancer even for people who do not smoke, researchers said
Thursday.
   ``Many people figure that since they don't smoke, they're safe
from lung cancer,'' said Richard Waxweiler, an epidemiologist at
the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and one of the
researchers who published the study in this week's Journal of the
American Medical Association.
   ``Being a non-smoker is no excuse for not having your home
tested for radon,'' Waxweiler said.
   Researchers who studied 516 Colorado uranium miners who had
never smoked cigarettes, pipes or cigars, found that 14 had died of
lung cancer between 1950 and 1984, a lung cancer death rate 12.7
percent higher than for a comparison group of non-smoking veterans,
the study found.
   Radon, a radioactive decay product of uranium, is a colorless,
odorless gas that can build up in closed areas such as mines and
houses, said Robert Roscoe, an epidemiologist at the National
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Cincinnati and one
of the researchers.
   ``These results confirm that exposure to radon (and related
radioactve decay products of uranium) in the absence of cigarette
smoking is a potent carcinogen that should be strictly
controlled,'' the researchers wrote.
   The uranium miners in the study worked an average of 14.6 years
in the mine.
   Federal law today is much more restrictive on how long uranium
miners can be exposed to radiation, compared with the 1950s, said
Victo Archer, an epidemiologist who has studied the history of
uranium miners.
   ``Today, uranium miners do not experience radiation levels
anywhere near like the miners of the past,'' Roscoe said.
   Previous studies of radon and miners examined those who had
already died of lung cancer and questioned friends and relatives
about the miners' smoking habits, Roscoe said. This study selected
a group of miners who said they never had smoked and followed them
for three decades.
   ``It took this long to finish the study because lung cancer is
rare and we had to wait for miners to die,'' Waxweiler said.
``Because we keep track of them for years and recorded their habits
when they were alive, we think our study is more accurate.''
   Uranium decays into radium, a radioactive element, Waxweiler
said. Radium further decays into radon gas, which moves through the
soil without combining with other gases.
   The damage from radon occurs as the gas decays, turning back
into a solid, Waxweiler said. Inhaled through the nose or mouth,
the solid particles become ``little short-range machine guns'' that
fire off radioactive, cancer-causing particles, he said.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency warns that children can
be especially harmed by radon, because they spend more time at home
than adults.
   ``We've been recommending testing for radon from the beginning
of time,'' said EPA spokeswoman Martha Casey in Washington.

   An Olympic Airways twin-engine propeller
plane carrying 34 people crashed into the Aegean today near Samos
island in thick fog, officials reported. There were no immediate
signs of survivors.
   The plane was flying from Salonica in northern Greece to the
eastern Aegean island, said Transport and Communications Minister
Nikos Gelestathis.
   Gelestathis said all of the 34 people aboard the aircraft were
Greek and that there was no indication anyone had survived the
crash.
   He told journalists that search planes spotted life jackets,
presumably from the plane, one to two miles off Samos' northwest
coast but that no survivors had been found.
   He said helicopters and planes were searching the area where the
life jackets were found, setting off flares as darkness set in.
   The passengers and crew were all Greek, Gelestathis said.
   Asked if authorities suspected that a terrorist act may have
downed the aircraft, Gelestathis said authorities were looking into
that possibility ``since the pilot gave no indication of any
problems.''
   Emmanuel Frangiadakis, Athens airport duty officer, said the
airport lost contact with the plane at about 4:55 p.m.
   Olympic officials in Salonica said Flight OA545 carried 34
people, including three crew members, and was scheduled to land at
Samos off Turkey's western coast at 5:30 p.m.
   The officials said the 30-seater plane, a British-built Short
aircraft, disappeared from the radar screens 25 miles northwest of
Samos about an hour after leaving Salonica.

<HEAD>Study Shows 254 Young Crack Abusers Committed 223,000 Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   MIAMI (A P) _ A study of254 hard-core juvenile crack cocaine
users found they commit an astonishing total of 223,000 crimes a
year, counting both drug possession itself and other crimes such as
robbery, assault and shoplifting.
   The pioneering Dade County research on children age 12 to 17
shows that current drug-prevention programs in the inner cities are
too little and too late, researchers and local officials said
Thursday.
   ``A large segment of a generation is being severely put at risk
because of crack cocaine,'' said James Rivers, the county's top
drug abuse official and author of the final report. ``If they
continue in this pattern, it is very likely they are going to get
into heavier crime, serious health consequences, and will never be
able to integrate into society.''
   The research focused on juvenile violators known to be drug
users _ nine out of 10 adolescents in the study had been arrested
at least once. All were interviewed about when they began abusing
alcohol and drugs and how many crimes they committed to sustain
their drug use.
   ``First use is an average age of 7 for their first drink, and by
13, half of these kids had been behind bars,'' said Rivers.
   The average age for the first time they became drunk was 8 years
old, first drug use occurred at 9.9 years, and regular drug use
began at age 11.
   Rivers said the adolescents confessed to an average of about 880
crimes each in the previous year, an amount he called ``stunning.''
   That average breaks down, with some numbers rounded, to 37 major
felonies ranging from assault to burglary, 101 prostitution and
other vice offenses, 205 petty property crimes such as shoplifting
and 538 drug sale and possession violations.
   But only one out of 555 crimes resulted in an arrest, the study
found, and only 4 percent of the juveniles ever received drug abuse
treatment.
   ``We've got a population of adolescents out there _ we don't
know how large it is _ that is heavily involved in drugs and
crime,'' said University of Delaware sociologist James Iniciardi,
who conducted many of the interviews. ``The current methods of
interdiction are really not doing anything for this group.''
   As other studies have shown, crack generates far more crime than
other addictive drugs such as heroin, Rivers said.
   ``Cocaine is a stimulant _ you remain agitated and alert,'' he
said. ``The small dosage and the short duration of the high ...
predisposes the user to use it again and again and again.''
   And when the users run out of money, they turn to crime, he said.
   Both Rivers and Iniciardi emphasized that those studied were
hard-core cases, not average adolescents. And they said many had
committed crimes even before becoming involved with drugs.
   The interviews were done between October 1986 and November 1987.
   ``It seems to be consistent with what we're seeing on the
streets _ and it's scary,'' said Miami police Lt. Jon Brooks, who
runs the city's street narcotics unit.
   Solutions are difficult, Rivers and Iniciardi said.
   ``Drugs are not the problem in the ghetto, the ghetto is the
problem in the ghetto,'' Iniciardi said. ``Drugs are a coping
mechanism, and for some, drugs are seen as a mechanism for upward
mobility to get out of the ghetto.''
   The men said drug programs, especially in the inner city, must
begin as early as preschool.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Michigan pediatrician selected to head the
new National Commission on AIDS said Thursday the panel should try
to reverse a lack of compassion she said has marked the fight
against the disease.
   Dr. June Osborn, dean of the University of Michigan School of
Public Health and a professor of pediatrics and communicable
diseases, said she will strive to bring greater humanity to the
nation's response to the epidemic.
   ``It's been hard for the country to get a sense that there are
real people'' who are infected with the human immunodeficiency
virus that causes AIDS, she said.
   ``But everybody who dies is somebody's son or daughter,'' she
said. ``This is happening to real people.''
   At its first meeting Thursday, the 15 commission members
selected Osborn as chairwoman and David E. Rogers, a professor of
medicine at Cornell University Medical College in New York and a
former president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, as vice
chairman.
   The commission began its work two weeks after President Bush
announced his two selections to the panel, which was created by
Congress last year to advise the president and Capitol Hill on AIDS
issues.
   The members spent most of the day getting acquainted with each
other, picking their leaders and exchanging philosophies and ideas.
   Osborne said she sees the commission as a unique forum for
giving people with AIDS a chance to say how their lives could be
made easier.
   ``If we can communicate commitment and compassion, we will have
added to something that has been lacking and the federal government
can't provide on its own,'' she said.
   Rep. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., a physician, said the panel could
provide some needed guidance to Congress on how to respond to the
AIDS epidemic.
   ``I think they need some direction,'' he said, noting the
country has no national policy on such AIDS-related issues as
confidentiality of testing.
   Belinda Mason, a young mother of two who is infected with the
AIDS virus, said she hopes the panel will focus part of its efforts
on discrimination against people with AIDS, which she has
experienced personally.
   ``It's getting harder and harder for people (with AIDS) to lead
decent lives,'' she said.
   The commission will meet again Aug. 17 to make personnel and
staffing decisions and meet again Sept. 18-19.
   The panel is to submit an interim report within a year and a
final report within two years.

<HEAD>Captors Say They Sparing Cicippio For Now; Make New Demands on Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pro-Iranian kidnappers holding Joseph
Cicippio said Thursday they had temporarily lifted the death
sentence imposed on the American hostage.
   The captors, who call themselves the Revolutionary Justice
Organization, said they would give Israel several days to meet new,
tougher conditions but did not say what would happen if the
Israelis refused.
   When the original threat to kill Cicippio was made Monday, his
captors demanded the release of a Shiite Moslem cleric abducted by
Israeli commandos July 28. The new terms include release of
unspecified ``Palestinian and Lebanese'' guerrillas.
   Israel has offered to trade Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, 33, and
other Lebanese Shiites it holds for Western hostages and three
Israeli soldiers held prisoner in Lebanon. Obeid is a spiritual
leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God, an Iranian-sponsored group
thought to be behind the kidnappings.
   In Jerusalem, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Israel would
examine the new demands ``on a positive basis.'' He would not
elaborate.
   Sheik Na'im Qassem, a Hezbollah leader, said there had been no
direct or indirect negotiations with Israel on a prisoner exchange
and would not be.
   After learning of the reprieve, Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Elham,
told The Associated Press by telephone: ``I am very happy. I never
lost hope. I hope this part of the ordeal is all over.''
   A short, written statement from the White House said in part:
``We regard this as an encouraging and hopeful development. But it
still does not answer our continuing concern for release of all
hostages. ... We express our appreciation to all those who have
been thus far trying to help.''
   The latest word about Cicippio came in a handwritten statement
from the Revolutionary Justice Organization delivered to a Western
news agency 45 minutes before the deadline of 10 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT)
it had set for killing him.
   It was the third time the group held off on its threat to kill
Cicippio.
   A photograph of the 58-year-old captive from the waist up, with
the trace of a smile on his face, accompanied the Arabic-language
statement.
   ``Out of respect for the intervention by the parties and states
with whom America pleaded to mediate and stop the execution, we
declare the freezing of the death sentence and its subsitution with
an initiative,'' the captors' statement said.
   None of the mediating nations was named, but press reports in
Beirut have said Iran, Syria and Algeria were believed to have
interceded.
   In addition to Obeid, the latest demands said Israel must free
Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas, whose names the kidnappers
said they would provide to the Red Cross.
   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise the
initiative will be considered canceled,'' the statement said,
without explaining what was meant.
   Revolutionary Justice stated its intentions with similar
vagueness last year and in 1987 when it allowed death threats
against Cicippio, another American hostage and a French captive to
fade.
   Earlier Thursday, Cicippio's captors had announced a four-hour
postponement of the death deadline and released a videotape in
which he read a statement asking Israel to free Obeid.
   On Monday, the captors of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins said they
had hanged him in retaliation for Obeid's abduction. The U.S.
Marine officer was kidnapped Feb. 17, 1988, while on U.N. duty in
southern Lebanon.
   Several reports have said Higgins was killed months ago. On
Thursday, the Israeli Defense Ministry said Obeid told
interrogators Higgins was alive last week, but Israel has said it
received word of his death long ago.
   Other than Higgins, 16 Westerners are missing and assumed
captive in Lebanon, including eight Americans. Held longest is
Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, known as a pragmatist, was sworn in Thursday
as president of Iran. He made no comment about the hostages and
there was no indication what role, if any, he played in the
decision about Cicippio.
   The Tehran Times said other countries should follow the French,
who ``succeeded in winning release of their hostages in Beirut
because they made an honorable deal.''
   All French hostages in Lebanon were released in 1987, but
details of the agreement were not revealed. Rafsanjani has tied
using Iran's ``good will'' to free Americans to the release of
Iranian assets frozen by the United States.
   On two occasions in 1988, Revolutionary Justice made death
threats against Cicippio and another American, Edward Austin Tracy,
58, a writer kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986, but did not carry them out.
   In March 1987, the kidnappers said they would kill French
hostage Jean-Louis Normandin unless France suspended arms sales to
Iraq, with which Iran was at war. They canceled the death threat
after three postponements covering nearly two weeks, and Normandin
was freed in November of that year.
   On the videotape, also delivered to a Western news agency,
Cicippio said: ``I appeal to each person having honor who can move
to release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, don't be late because they are
very serious to hang us and the period become very soon and the
hours very little.''
   He had a bushy beard and was shown from the waist up reading
from a statement. The poor English suggested it was written by his
captors.
   Cicippio wore glasses, was dressed in a blue track suit and
appeared haggard and distressed.
   ``My dear wife and people and all the human society and
especially the Red Cross, don't leave me,'' he said. ``So to help
me move I demand from the American people to oblige Israel to
release Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid immediately because his kidnapping
is not human.
   ``We the American people are always the victims of Israel's
politics and President Bush has not helped to free us,'' said
Cicippio, who was acting comptroller of the American University of
Beirut when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986.
   His voice broke with emotion when he ended the appeal with this
message for his Lebanese wife, Elham Ghandour, a secretary at the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut:
   ``Goodbye, my wife. If you don't hear my voice and see my face
again, I want you to look after yourself, and don't be sad, and
always remember me.''
   Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping
operations, met in Beirut on Thursday with Shiite leaders and
Iranian Embassy personnel.
   ``I still do not know whether Col. Higgins is dead,'' he said.
``But if he is dead, I hope that whoever is holding his body will
make it available so it can be returned to his family for a decent
burial in his home country.''
   Higgins' kidnappers called themselves the Organization of the
Oppressed on Earth.
   Ad-Diyar, a conservative Beirut newspaper, said Iran had told
the United States delivery of the body was conditional on Obeid's
release. Iran's official news agency described the report as
``baseless allegations.''

<HEAD>TV Evangelist Says He Prayed with President Over Hostage Ordeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Television evangelist Robert Schuller said he
prayed with President Bush on Thursday over the ordeal of the
hostages in Lebanon and was confident Bush would take action
``Americans will be proud of'' if another American captive were
killed.
   Schuller, host of television's ``Hour of Power'' religious show
and pastor of the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove, Calif., said
he was invited to the White House before the hostage crisis erupted.
   He said the conversation turned to the plight of the hostages
and that Bush ``made it clear he would take appropriate action'' if
another hostage were killed in the wake of Monday's reported
hanging of Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   Without specifying what that action might be, Schuller said,
``If there is the loss of another life, Americans will be proud of
the response that President Bush will take. I feel that very
certainly.''
   He added, ``I think that if the president felt that for the
preservation of life and liberty that drastic action is necessary,
he was the will to take such an action.''
   Schuller spoke with reporters in the White House driveway before
the announcement from Lebanon of a suspension in the threatened
execution of hostage Joseph Cicippio.
   The pastor praised Bush for calling world leaders to try to
bring about a peaceful resolution.
   He said that at Bush's invitation, they prayed together in the
Oval Office for the hostages.
   ``He allowed me to continue to pray even though the phone was
ringing and a head of a powerful state abroad was on the line,''
Schuller said.

<HEAD>Dodd Hits Administration Efforts to Keep Contras Going</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's efforts to forestall
the disbanding of Nicaragua's Contra rebels amount to a breach of
an agreement with Congress and could lead to a cutoff of all aid to
the rebels, a leading Contra critic said Thursday.
   ``I'm convinced that if the administration succeeds'' in
pressuring the presidents of the Central American countries to
delay disbanding the Contras, ``that you will see humanitarian aid
to the Contras cut off on Nov. 30,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd,
D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Western
Hemisphere subcommittee.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, went to Guatemala on Wednesday to urge diplomats preparing
for a weekend meeting of the Central American presidents to keep
the rebels together until after Nicaragua's national elections,
scheduled for Feb. 25.
   At a Capitol Hill news conference, Contra leader Adolfo Calero
welcomed the Bush administration's position. ``We are elated that
President Bush has come out unequivocally in favor of having the
resistance remain as a viable force,'' he said.
   Calero said he is confident that the regional presidents ``have
enough information and realism to recognize that it was through the
efforts of the resistance that a political process was made
possible. This is still under way and can't be demobilized until
the process reaches a conclusion. You do not take down a scaffold
before a building is finished.''
   In a related development, the House Intelligence Committee
delayed action on a Democratic proposal to bar CIA political aid to
opposition parties in Nicaragua, bowing to a request from Secretary
of State James A. Baker III.
   The administration wants to keep the option of covert aid to
anti-Sandinista candidates, but the Intelligence panel may take up
the issue again when Congress returns in September from a
month-long recess.
   A senior State Department official, briefing reporters on the
Aronson trip, cited complaints that the Sandinista government is
raiding suspected Contra sympathizers in northern Nicaragua and has
failed to create fair conditions for political opponents.
   ``That is hardly the kind of action that the government should
be taking if it wants to create the conditions that would allow the
resistance to reintegrate,'' said the official, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   ``Frankly, it is not clear that the Sandinista government really
wants to embrace national reconciliation and reintegration of the
resistance. Their narrow goal appears to be simply to take away
their weapons and let them scatter to the winds.''
   But Dodd, in an interview with a group of reporters, said the
administration's efforts to influence the regional peace process
threaten to unravel a bipartisan accord on U.S. policy reached
between Bush and congressional Democrats on March 24.
   That agreement called for some $40 million in renewed
humanitarian aid to the rebels through Feb. 28, 1990. But it also
provided that the aid could be used for voluntary relocation of
rebel fighters back into Nicaragua, and stipulated that it could be
cut off Nov. 30 if key Democrats on Capitol Hill believed the
administration was not adequately supporting peace efforts.
   Both sides said they believed that approach would permit the
armed opposition to be reintegrated into Nicaragua's political life
and would encourage the Sandinista regime to make bona fide reforms
in the electoral processes and to restore political freedoms.
   But if Bush is bringing pressure on the Central American
presidents to put off demobilization of the rebels until after the
February elections, Dodd said, ``the bipartisan accord may well
become a dead letter.''
   Dodd said he was not suggesting that demobilization of the
rebels begin immediately or be completed before the elections. But
he said neither should the start of the process be postponed until
after the balloting.
   He released a letter to Secretary of State James A. Baker III
asking that the administration release some of the $70 million in
U.S. economic aid to Honduras appropriated for the current year but
which is being held up.
   The administration clearly is using the money as leverage to
pressure the Hondurans into continuing to host the Contra camps
along their border with Nicaragua and into opposing demobilization,
he said.

<HEAD>Former Sheriff Pleads Guilty to Charges Stemming from Inmate's Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former sheriff pleaded guilty Thursday
to two federal charges stemming from accusations that he helped an
escaped inmate avoid capture.
   Judge F.A. Little of Alexandria gave former Natchitoches Parish
Sheriff Norm Fletcher a three-year suspended prison sentence and
fined him $12,600.
   ``I'm glad the whole thing's over,'' Fletcher, 58, said after
the court proceedings. ``In one or two instances I let my
compassion overtake my better judgment.''
   Fletcher pleaded innocent to a six-count federal indictment
charging him with helping Fred Bates Jr. flee the parish (county)
jail while awaiting prosecution on a 1984 burglary charge. Bates
was captured in August 1988 in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.
   At Thursday's hearing, Fletcher changed his plea to guilty of
conspiracy after the fact and misprision of felony.
   Those charges concerned his failure to report Bates' whereabouts
after his escape and Fletcher's neglecting to use the National
Crime Information Center computer to check out an alias that Bates
may have taken.
   In return for the guilty pleas, Assistant U.S. Attorney John
Lydick of Shreveport dropped the four other charges, which accused
Fletcher of helping Bates escape.
   During federal investigations of Fletcher, Bates told
investigators that Fletcher granted him special privileges at the
jail in return for sexual favors.
   Fletcher denied this and no charges were ever brought in
connection with those allegations. Fletcher did admit to granting
special privileges to Bates and other prisoners _ including
allowing them to attend college courses _ because he believed it
helped in rehabilitation.
   The four counts dropped included one each of conspiracy; aiding
and abetting unauthorized flight to avoid prosecution; accessory
after the fact, and conspiracy after the fact.

<HEAD>Orchestra's Fate Awaits Board's Decision Friday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of the Denver Symphony Orchestra, which
is $4 million in debt, meets Friday to decide whether the entire
concert season should be canceled for the first time in the
orchestra's 55-year history.
   Last season was cut short in March, two months early, because of
financial problems.
   The next symphony season, usually 41 weeks beginning in
September, already has been sharply scaled back, with a tentative
start date in January. There is a chance there may be no season at
all, orchestra officials have said.
   ``I am hesitant to say it is an absolute decision day,'' Denver
Symphony Association Chairman John Low said of the meeting.
``Nevertheless, I am hopeful we will reach a decision.''
   The orchestra's problems have been blamed on the region's
declining economy, the city's 10 percent seat tax and management
turnover, said Josi Callan, the marketing director. The orchestra
must raise $600,000 a month to keep operating.
   ``Maybe that's more than this area wants to pay for it,'' Ms.
Callan said.
   The orchestra averages 15,000 to 16,000 attendance at classical
concerts in the 26,000-seat Boettcher Concert Hall, but has sold
out the hall for pops concerts.
   Earlier this summer the board rejected a proposed 27-week season
which was to have begun in November. The board cited the symphony's
unresolved $4 million debt and the fact that musicians had not
agreed to contract modifications and other concessions.
   The recovery plan the board will examine Friday calls for the
symphony's endowment fund trustees to forgive a $2.5 million debt
from the orchestra.
   Symphony executives have also asked the City Council to write
off $700,000 the symphony owes the city in back rent on the concert
hall.
   City Councilman Ted Hackworth opposes forgiving the back rent
and said the symphony should declare bankruptcy.
   ``What it's going to take is for them to wake up and realize
they have to operate like a business, not a charity,'' Hackworth
said.
   Earlier this week, the symphony notified its 81 musicians that
their dental and health benefits were canceled effective Wednesday,
saving the association about $30,000 a month.
   Three years ago the musicians agreed to 20 percent pay cuts to
keep the symphony solvent.
   Since then the symphony's financial woes have multiplied.
   A year ago, then-board chairman Robert E. Lee threatened to put
the orchestra into Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings because of
debt, then resigned the next month after a fund-raising drive
brought $700,000 in private and corporate contributions.
   Later, music director Phillippe Entremont and executive director
Chris Dunworth resigned.
   Low said that the recovery plan the board will consider would
have the orchestra spend ``less money on high-priced guest artists
and rely more heavily on the music provided by the orchestra
itself.''
   Orchestras in Oakland and San Diego, Calif., New Orleans and
Nashville, Tenn., have filed for bankruptcy and then resumed
operations after reorganizing.

   Police confiscated 106
elephant tusks and arrested people allegedly involved in the
biggest ivory smuggling operation yet uncovered in South Africa,
authorities said Thursday.
   Police found the ivory in the Cape Town home of Michael Shen, a
37-year-old Taiwanese citizen who has lived in South Africa for the
past nine years. Shen and an unspecified number of other men were
arrested Wednesday, police said.
   It was not immediately clear whether the tusks came from
elephants in South Africa or elsewhere on the continent, police
said. One rhino horn also was confiscated, they said.
   South Africa's well-managed wildlife parks have few reported
incidents of poaching, but conservationists say the country is a
major transit point for smugglers in other parts of Africa.
   The African elephant population has fallen from about 1.5
million in 1978 to as few as 400,000 today, mostly because of
poachers who seek the valuable tusks.
   Several Western nations, including the United States, have
banned the import of ivory in recent months. The 102-nation
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species will
consider a worldwide ban on the ivory trade in October.

   Israel welcomed the decision of Lebanese
captors to suspend their death sentence on an American, but stuck
to its position of freeing a Shiite Moslem cleric only in a trade
for hostages.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization had said it would kill
Joseph Cicippio, but released a handwritten statement 45 minutes
before the deadline saying it had suspended the death threat and
including new demands.
   In addition to Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, a Shiite Moslem cleric
abducted by Israel, it now wants the release of ``Palestinian and
Lebanese'' guerrillas in Israeli jails. It said the names would be
given to the Red Cross.
   ``Acceptance should be announced within days, otherwise the
initiative will be considered canceled,'' the kidnappers said,
without explaining what the vague language meant.
   ``I can tell you that all the sides now have more time,'' said a
senior Defense Ministry official.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told reporters in Jerusalem: ``If
indeed there are real grounds for the report on a proposal for
prisoners exchange, we shall examine it on a positive basis.''
   Officials declined to say whether they believed the new demands
provided an opening for negotiations.
   ``What remains to be seen is whether Hezbollah is ready to do
business and ready to negotiate the exchange we have proposed. This
is why we are cautious,'' said Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   Obeid is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, a pro-Iranian group
believed to be responsible for the kidnapping Westerners in Lebanon.
   Yossi Ahimeir, a top Shamir aide, insisted Cicippio be freed
before negotiations.
   ``Cicippio should be released immediately,'' he added. ``He
should go back to his family. He is an innocent man.''
   Other Israeli officials expressed concern over a reference to
freeing Palestinian prisoners from the uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip. That could include more than 8,000
Palestinian detainees.
   Earlier Thursday, Israel issued a plea for the Shiites not to
carry out the threatened killing of Cicippio but said it would free
Obeid only if it got back Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages.
   ``We still stick to our position that we are ready to exchange
kidnap victims and hostages,'' Ahimeir said. ``Our goal is to
rescue, save our people in Lebanon in the hands of several
organizations there.''
   The Lebanese captors on Thursday released a videotaped plea from
Cicippio, who called for the release of Obeid and added: ``Don't be
late ... because they are very serious.''
   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid from his home in south Lebanon
on July 28. Israel says he planned guerrilla raids and directed the
kidnapping of Lt. Co. William R. Higgins, a U.S. Marine serving
with U.N peacekeepers, in February 1988.
   Higgins' captors said they hanged him Monday.
   Ahimeir reported ``all kinds of consultations'' within the
government about the hostage crisis.
   Yossi Ben Aharon, a top aide to Shamir, said Israel was in
``constant touch'' with the U.S. government, but he would not say
whether Shamir had talked by telephone with President Bush.
   The Foreign Ministry summoned the ambassadors of West Germany,
Italy and Britain, whose citizens are among the hostages in
Lebanon, and also the Japanese envoy.
   Israel radio said the Japanese ambassador was called in because
Japan was involved in contacts with Iran. The radio gave no details
and ministry officials could not be reached for comment.
   Higgins' captors released a poor-quality videotape of a man who
appeared to be the Marine colonel hanging from a gallows. There was
no way of telling when the tape was made, conflicting reports have
arisen about when he was killed.
   A Defense Ministry statement said Obeid told interrogators he
believed Higgins was alive last week.
   The statement said Israel continued to believe Higgins was
killed late last year. Officials said they might give Obeid to a
lie-detector test to determine what he knew about the American
officer.

   America is better at recalling
automobiles than it is at warning medical implant recipients of
defects in their devices, the director of a new alert system said
Thursday.
   ``There are people who are dying in this country every year
because the device they are wearing is malfunctioning and they
don't know it,'' said Donald Nichols, executive vice president of
International Implant Registry.
   Nichols visited the ``Bionics and Transplants'' display at the
Science Museum of Minnesota to call attention to his fledgling
non-profit service, which has been spurned by several large
manufacturers of medical implant devices.
   The registry, part of Turlock, Calif.,-based Medic Alert, seeks
to create a computer data base of implantable devices and notify
physicians of government warnings or manufacturer recalls. The
physicians would use addresses provided by the registry to contact
their patients.
   Although federal regulations require medical device makers to
report product hazards to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,
the agency has no direct way to notify hospitals, physicians or
patients of product recalls, Nichols said. Manufacturers forward
the warnings to the medical institutions and doctors who purchased
the devices, he said, but patient addresses are often outdated.
   Nichols estimated that the contact rate in some alert cases is
as low as 30 percent. The registry, he said, could consistently
achieve a contact rate of more than 80 percent.
   ``The record overall is not a good one,'' Nichols said. ``Right
now in this country we can recall automobiles more quickly than we
can recall the devices that are in people's bodies.''
   In Washington, D.C., however, a consumer group said the FDA was
``negligent and reckless'' in failing to enforce the notification
law.
   Public Citizen Health Research Group said FDA documents showed
makers of heart pacemakers, wheelchairs and breast implants ignore
the reporting requirement, and that the FDA has failed to seek
prosecution of the companies.
   The FDA said it disagreed with the assessment and that the group
had incorrectly interpreted some data in evaluating the public
health risk.
   Kent Milton of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration in Washington, D.C., said the notification rate on
automobile recalls is never below 50 percent.
   Nichols said the importance of prompt patient warnings was
underscored in 1985 when a defect in a series of Bjork-Shiley
artificial heart valves resulted in about 100 deaths. He said the
registry would have speeded the warnings and possibly saved lives.
A spokeswoman for Irving, Calif.,-based Bjork-Shiley said the firm
was checking whether or not this was a problem for them in 1985.
   Nichols said only a few device manufacturers are interested in
paying for the service. The registry charges an initial fee of $25
a patient and $10 a patient each subsequent year.
   Dick Reid, a spokesman for Fridley-based Medtronic Inc., one of
the largest manufacturers of heart pacemakers, said the registry
would be a costly duplication of a service Medtronic already
provides.
   ``We have our own patient implant registry and we keep it
updated,'' Reid said. ``At least in the pacemaker area we feel it
tracks 98 percent of the Medtronic pacemakers in place in the
United States.''
   Nichols said Medtronic has a good record of notifying customers
of defects, but he said the industry as a whole is weak. More than
1.1 million people receive medical implants annually and the
industry produces an array of more than 200 devices.
   A spokeswoman for the FDA in Chicago said the agency is not
aware of the registry and therefore could not comment on whether
there is a need for it.
   Mark Wood, an account manager in the risk management department
at St. Paul Companies, the largest medical malpractice insurance
underwriter in the U.S., said there is room for improvement in
warning patients of implant defects. But he said he is not familiar
with the International Implant Registry.
   ``Having some kind of a standardized system where you could
track a product to its end user could be helpful,'' Wood said.
   Still in its first year, the registry has only 15,000 entries.
Nichols said it must add 10,000 to 12,000 entries a year to be
successful, and the first eight months of this year have yielded
only 3,000 additions.
   Nichols said the registry is planning to appeal directly to
implant patients to pay for the service. It's too early to tell if
that approach will work, he said.

   The leader of Uganda's Roman Catholic
Church condemned the recent suffocations of 69 civilians by
government troops and called for an independent investigation into
the killings, a newspaper said Thursday.
   ``We condemn in the strongest terms this criminal act of the
murder of innocent citizens in cold blood by the National
Resistance Army,'' said Cardinal Emmanuel Nsubuga. ``We hope that
such atrocities will never be repeated in our nation.''
   He was quoted in the government-owned newspaper New Vision.
   The government has said the victims were among 238 youths
detained June 10 and held in unused railroad cars in war-torn
northeastern Uganda. The soldiers, who were fighting rebels in the
area at the time, had rounded up the people in villages near the
city of Kumi, 155 miles northeast of Kampala.
   
   The government has also said that those who died were innocent,
because the rebels already had been taken to army headquarters.
   The army has arrested 14 officers in the case. The officers
could face the death penalty if convicted of murder.
   Nsubuga urged an independent inquiry into the incident.

<TEXT>
   Parents of two boys shot to death
by police concealed in crates on a truck won an early victory
Thursday in their fight to prosecute the officers for murder.
   Supreme Court Justice D.M. Williamson rejected a request by the
13 defendants _ one army officer and 12 policemen _ that he order
the parents to post a deposit of $360,000 to cover possible legal
costs in event of acquittal. The parents' lawyers doubted such a
sum could be raised.
   Williamson noted the government is paying the defendants' legal
costs and said granting the request ``may be loading the scales in
favor of the accused.''
   The defendants went on trial for murder Tuesday in an
unprecedented private prosecution.
   The parents decided to pursue the case on their own after the
attorney general for Cape Province declined to prosecute despite an
inquest magistrate's finding that police were negligent.
   It is the first murder trial to proceed under a law allowing
private citizens to press a prosecution in certain instances where
the government declines.
   The killings took place in 1985 during anti-apartheid unrest in
a mixed-race township near Cape Town. The case became known as the
Trojan Horse incident because white police concealed themselves in
what looked like a delivery truck.
   According to evidence at the inquest, an army commandant and two
senior police officers ordered the truck into Athlone to draw
attacks from stone-throwers.
   Gunfire from the hidden policemen killed Shaun Magmoed, 16,
Michael Miranda, 11, and Jonathen Classens, 21. The magistrate
concluded no evidence emerged that the three were among a handful
of youths who threw stones.
   Miranda's mother and Magmoed's father instituted the
prosecution. Their lawyers are to be paid from a fund set up last
year which has received contributions from overseas human rights
organizations.

<HEAD>GAO Details Rise in Cable Fees; Legislators Say Study Inadequate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA M. HAMM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional study released Thursday said
cable television charges have risen 29 percent since federal
regulation ended three years ago. Several legislators complained
about inadequacies in the report and one called it ``virtually
useless.''
   The report, by the General Accounting Office, an investigative
arm of the Congress, was presented to the telecommunications
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Shortly Afterward, Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., issued a statement
saying the study ``is badly flawed and virtually useless to
Congress.''
   Gore, who has introduced a Senate bill to reregulate the cable
industry and encourage competition, called the study results ``out
of date'' and pointed out that the agency had surveyed less than 20
percent of the industry.
   Indeed, members of the subcommittee itself were critical of the
report because, while it examined rate increases instituted in the
22 months following deregulation, it contained no information about
cable companies' capitalization costs, the selling of franchises,
advertising revenue or the industry's financial picture.
   The committee chairman, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., asked the
GAO to prepare a second study by next spring addressing a wider
range of concerns.
   ``There are some things that need to be looked at in a little
more detail than our study shows,'' conceded John M. Ols Jr.,
director of housing and community development issues for the GAO.
But he said the survey released Thursday was patterned on
instructions from the subcommittee.
   As for the GAO data, Ols said, ``We stand behind those figures
from a statistical standpoint.'' He said the survey of 1,950 of the
nation's approximately 9,000 cable operators was ``roughly a
national sample. We took really more than we had to.''
   But Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said he suspected that the 25
percent of cable operators that did not respond to the survey had
imposed ``substantially higher'' rate increases than those that did
respond.
   The GAO report found that the average monthly rate for the least
expensive, basic cable service increased 29 percent from December
1986, when government regulations were lifted, to October 1988. The
average basic fee rose from $11.23 to $14.48 during the study
period, the GAO said.
   Despite the stiff increase for basic service, the GAO said the
average subscriber's monthly bill rose a smaller 14 percent, from
$21.58 to $24.68.
   Industry representatives told the panel that customers are
getting a better value for their money now than in 1986 because the
quality of cable offerings has improved and the average number of
channels offered by cable systems has risen from 24 to 30.
   Cable companies channeled $246 million in 1986, $292 million in
1987 and $417 million in 1988 into upgrading equipment and adding
channels, said James P. Mooney, president and chief executive
officer of the National Cable Television Association.
   Under deregulation, the Federal Communications Commission
allowed cable television operators, who since 1972 had to receive
permission from local authorities to raise prices for basic
service, to set their own rates.

<HEAD>Helms Delays Action on Bush Nominee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., on Thursday delayed
Senate action for at least a month on President Bush's nomination
of a senior black diplomat to be director general of the U.S.
Foreign Service, the nation's professional diplomatic corps.
   Exercising his rights under the rules of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Helms put a ``hold'' on the nomination of
Edward J. Perkins, until recently the U.S. ambassador to South
Africa.
   Normally that would delay action for a week only. But because
the Senate is ready to leave on its summer vacation, Helms' move
effectively postpones Perkins' confirmation for more than a month,
until the beginning of September at the earliest.
   Helms refused to give a reason for his action.
   But he acted after complaining about delays in Senate
consideration of three ambassadorial nominees, all major
contributors to Republican campaigns and causes, who have been
rated as ``unqualified'' by the American Academy of Diplomacy.
   He also complained that some career Foreign Service officers on
a promotion list had been targets of State Department
investigations in the past for alleged expense account abuse.
   And he made clear he is also upset that no Senate action has
been scheduled on Bush's nomination of Donald P. Gregg to be U.S.
ambassador to South Korea.
   In two lengthy Senate hearings Gregg denied that he _ while
serving as Bush's vice presidential chief of staff _ was ever part
of the secret network set up by former Marine Lt. Col. Oliver L.
North to provide illegal military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels.
   But Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., has said he questions Gregg's
truthfulness.
   The committee did approve and send to the Senate a number of
diplomatic nominations.
   One of the nominees, Julia Chang Bloch, who was born in China
and emigrated to the United States as a refugee, would be the first
Asian-American ambassador in U.S. history.
   Named to be U.S. ambassador to Nepal, she most recently served
as an assistant director of the Agency for International
Development.
   Also approved by the committee were:
   Richard A. Clarke to be assistant secretary of state for
politico-military affairs; Eugene P. Kopp to be deputy director of
the U.S. Information Agency (USIA); Henry E. Hockeimer to be an
associate USIA director; Sheldon J. Krys to be assistant secretary
of state for diplomatic security; Alexander F. Watkins to be deputy
U.S. representative to the United Nations; Milton J. Wilkinson to
be deputy representative to the U.N. Security Council.
   Also, Morris D. Busby to be coordinator for counter terrorism;
Arthur W. Fort to be assistant secretary of state for
administration; Raymond G. H. Seitz to be assistant secretary of
state for European and Canadian affairs; Raymond C. Ewing to be
ambassador to Ghana; William L. Swing to be ambassador to South
Africa; Howard K. Walker to be ambassador to Madagascar; Michael G.
Sotirhos to be ambassador to Greece.
   And, Loret Miller Ruppe, former director of the Peace Corps, to
be ambassador to Norway; Richard A. Moore to be ambassador to
Ireland, and Jonathan Moore to be U.S. representative for refugee
affairs at the United Nations.

<HEAD>FAA Calls For Jetliner Study, Senator Says Ground DC-10s If Flawed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced
Thursday a design review aimed at increasing the safety of all
wide-bodied jetliners bercause of accidents where in-flight
failures damaged control devices.
   At the same time, a U.S. senator called for the immediate
grounding and alteration of all wide-bodied DC-10s if news reports
suggesting flaws in their design are true.
   The FAA said an industry and government task force would
recommend whether changes are necessary in ``all existing and
future wide-body aircraft,'' which would include planes made by
Boeing, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas and the Airbus Industrie
consortium in Europe.
   Tony Broderick, head of FAA safety regulations, said he believes
safety improvements that will ensure against failure of flight
control systems when another component fails ``are within the realm
of technical and economic feasibility.''
   Broderick said in an interview he had no detailed idea of how
that might be done, but expects ``the best minds in industry and
government'' can solve the problem.
   The aegncy announcement came two weeks after the crash of a
United Airlines DC-10 in Iowa that killed 111 people. Investigators
believe an explosive engine failure knocked out all three hydraulic
flight control systems designed to back up each other.
   The plane crashed, broke apart and burst into flames, but 186
people, including the cockpit crew, survived.
   The FAA cited the Sioux City, Iowa, crash as well as a 1985
Japan Airlines crash of a Boeing 747 and a 1981 incident in which a
Lockheed-built L-1011 lost hydraulic control. Both DC-10s and
L-1011s are no longer in production, although hundreds are flown
throughout the world.
   The review will look into survivability of aircraft after major
in-flight structural damage, said FAA Administrator James Busey.
   Busey said the task force will explore ways of improving the
ability of an aircraft to survive after it suffers major in-flight
structural damage.
   ``The task force will explore feasible improvements to the
backup flight control systems,'' the FAA said.
   Other aircraft with similar controls to those that failed would
also be included at a later stage in the study, the agency said.
   ``It also will examine engine design with an eye toward possibly
preventing crippling damage to an aircraft in the event of an
engine explosion,'' the FAA said.
   The aviation agency approves design, construction, testing, and
operation of all airliners used by U.S. carriers, and many foreign
governments follow its lead. It now requires that jet engines be
built to contain fragments of fans, compressors or turbine blades
that may break off in flight.
   But, the FAA said its regulation recognize that ``there is no
practical way to contain the parts on which the blades are mounted
_ the disks _ when they fail becuase of their weight and the speed
at which they travel.''
   Investigators are exploring the possibility of such a failure in
the Iowa crash.
   Sen Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, in a letter to the FAA, cited
news accounts saying that if the DC-10 had four rather than three
hydraulic systems, as the L-1011 does, or a shut-off valve to
prevent hydraulic fluid loss, lives might have been saved.
   ``If these allegations are true, the FAA should ground all
DC-10s and correct their design flaws immediately,'' he said.
   Broderick, speaking for the FAA, said, ``There are no design
flaws in the DC-10 or any other aircraft presently flying that
warrant its grounding.''
   He said the agency would respond promptly to Metzenbaum's letter.

   ``Lonesome Dove'' stampeded over
its TV rivals as CBS' cowpoke miniseries gathered a leading 18
nominations Thursday for the Primetime Emmy Awards, while ABC's hit
``Roseanne'' was all but snubbed.
   NBC's swank drama ``L.A. Law'' collected 17 nominations and
ABC's 30-hour World War II miniseries ``War and Remembrance'' drew
15 citations. The nostalgic ABC comedy ``The Wonder Years''
gathered 14 nominations, followed by the network's hug-heavy drama
``thirtysomething'' with 13 selections.
   ``It is very exciting and very gratifying to have the feeling
that win, lose or draw ... we are doing first-rate work,'' said
``L.A. Law'' co-creator Steven Bochco.
   The new CBS situation comedy ``Murphy Brown,'' a satiric view of
a television news magazine, got 11 nominations. ``I'm very excited;
I'm excited for all of us,'' said the show's star, Candice Bergen.
   Fox's offbeat variety series ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' finished
with 10 nominations, as did NBC's perpetual Emmy favorite ``The
Golden Girls.''
   ``Roseanne,'' the crass working-class comedy that was last
season's highest-rated new show, received only three nominations.
   Series star Roseanne Barr was not among the five choices for
best actress in a comedy series, and the series was not named in
the best comedy sweepstakes. John Goodman earned the show's only
major nomination for best actor in a comedy series.
   ``She's very pleased about (co-star) John Goodman's nomination
and she's disappointed the show didn't get nominated. That's all,''
said publicist Pat Kingsley.
   In its last, trouble-plagued season, ABC's ``Moonlighting'' was
handed only three nominations, all in minor categories.
   The syndicated series ``Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and the
CBS drama ``Beauty and the Beast'' each received eight nominations.
   NBC's explosive abortion-law movie ``Roe vs. Wade'' _ which was
subjected to more than 17 network-mandated rewrites, abandoned by
advertisers and the target of anti-abortion protests _ earned six
nominations, all in major categories.
   ``It makes you feel that it is all worth it,'' said Alison
Cross, the writer and co-producer of ``Roe vs. Wade.'' ``This
rewards us for having survived the process. All those people who
say, `You can't get anything good on television' are wrong.''
   The Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences said it handed out 364
nominations in 84 categories, with NBC taking the most with 103.
   Among the nominations for ``Lonesome Dove,'' based on the
Pulitzer Prize- winning novel by Larry McMurtry, were best
miniseries and outstanding acting achievement by Tommy Lee Jones,
Robert Duvall, Diane Lane, Danny Glover, Anjelica Huston and Glenne
Headly.
   The eight-hour miniseries also snared nominations for directing
and writing.
   ``L.A. Law'' courted 17 nominations as best drama series and for
nine actors, Michael Tucker and Jill Eikenberry, who portray a
couple on the show and are married in real life; Susan Dey; Larry
Drake; Jimmy Smits; Richard Dysart; Michelle Greene; Susan Ruttan
and Amanda Plummer. The series also received two directing and
three writing nominations.
   ``War and Remembrance,'' the sequel to ``Winds of War,'' based
on Herman Wouk's sweeping novel, drew nominations for best
miniseries and lead acting awards for John Gielgud and Jane Seymour
and supporting honors for Polly Bergen. It also was nominated for
directing.
   ``I'm glad they haven't forgotten us,'' said Dan Curtis,
producer, director and co-writer of the 30-hour miniseries.
   Other nominees for best miniseries were NBC's ``I Know My First
Name is Steven,'' PBS' ``A Perfect Spy'' and ABC's ``The Women of
Brewster Place.''
   ``The Wonder Years'' was nominated as best comedy series and its
young star Fred Savage was nominated as best lead actor in a comedy
series. It also received three nominations for directing and four
for writing.
   Comedy series nominees along with ``The Wonder Years'' were
NBC's ``Cheers,'' CBS' ``Designing Women,'' and ``The Golden
Girls'' and ``Murphy Brown.''
   The yuppie-themed ``thirtysomething,'' winner of four Emmy

   The Justice Department is reviewing
anti-terrorist laws to determine if a Shiite Moslem cleryman
kidnapped by Israel can be charged with the kidnapping and murder
of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, sources said Thursday.
   The Justice Department is trying to determine if a ``case could
be built for extradition'' of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, who was
seized last week by Israeli commandos at his home in Lebanon, said
a U.S. official.
   Bringing a case against the Shiite Muslim clergyman involves not
only complicated legal but very sensitive political and diplomatic
issues as well.
   If the government decided a criminal case could be made against
Obeid, the Bush administration would have to decide whether it
would risk the lives of Americans still held hostage in the Middle
East by taking the Moslem leader into custody for prosecution.
   The FBI, meanwhile, is reviewing two statutes that empower the
the arrest, detention and prosecution of terrorists for the
kidnapping of Americans overseas and the murder of U.S. citizens in
foreign countries, according to a law enforcement source.
   The source declined to describe the review as an active
investigation, saying the bureau was determining if it had
enforcement jurisdiction.
   Officials interviewed about the case spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Asked if the Bush administration was considering extradition of
Obeid for possible involvement in Higgins' kidnapping, presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``the Justice Department, I am
told, is looking into the case.''
   It is unclear if the statements Obeid has made to his Israeli
interrogators so far would provide Justice Department prosecutors
with enough evidence to swear out an arrest warrant.
   The statements from the interrogation that have been shared with
U.S. authorities do not amount to anything more than possibly
aiding and abetting the kidnapping, one official said.
   It is also unclear whether the statements Obeid made to his
Israeli interrogators would be admissable in an American courtroom
because he was presumably not advised of his right under the U.S.
Constitution to remain silent, the official said.
   Based on interrogations of Obeid, Israeli authorities say the
three people who kidnapped Higgins in February 1988 were in the
sheik's house before the abduction and one of them returned there
later.
   The car used to kidnap Higgins was hidden in Obeid's garage,
Israeli officials have said.
   Israeli officials say Obeid admitted that those who planned the
1986 capture of two Israeli soldiers left from Obeid's house to
carry out their mission.
   Such evidence may not be enough to charge Obeid with
participation in the kidnapping.
   ``Whether they can make a case is the crucial fact in
extradition,'' said another U.S. official, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``To actually use formal extradition, you
to to have a charging document, a complaint, indictment,
information or something.''
   In U.S. federal law, an ``information'' serves the same purpose
as an indictment but does not involve a grand jury because either
the defendant has waived his right to grand jury consideration of
an indictment or a magistrate has found probable cause to believe a
crime has been committed.
   A former federal prosecutor familiar with extradition issues
said the U.S.-Israeli extradition treaty does not contain serious
legal obstacles to extraditing a terrorist being held by Israel.
   But the former prosecutor, who requested anonymity, said the
real obstacle is Israel's willingness to give up Obeid _ if it does
so, terrorists holding Israel citizens will see Israel as
``assisting the great devil'' and react with ``no holds barred.''
   The statutes being reviewed by the FBI were passed by Congress
in recent years in response to terrorist attacks on American
citizens and officials overseas.
   A 1984 statute forbids the taking of Americans as hostages to
compel a foreign government or third party ``to do or or abstain
from any act'' as a condition of the prisoner's release. The crime
is punishable up to life imprisonment.
   The 1986 law, a provision of the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and
Anti-Terrorism Act,'' allows federal prosecution of terrorists who
murder U.S. citizens overseas. The murder or conspiracy to murder a
U.S. citizen in a foreign country carries a maximum life sentence.
   Under federal law, if investigators could prove that Obeid
participated in Higgins' kidnapping last year, he could be
prosecuted for the Marine officer's murder because that killing was
a consequence of his abduction.
   But as Fitzwater told reporters at the White House: ``There is
no warrant for his arrest, no charges at this time.''
   The case ``would have to be reviewed as a legal matter and
pursued through normal legal channels.''

<HEAD>Family Feared Cicippio Might Be Kidnapped</HEAD>

   Joseph Cicippio always worked hard, his family says, so it was
no surprise that he left home an hour early on Sept. 12, 1986, for
his job as acting comptroller of American University.
   It also was no great surprise to his relatives that Cicippio,
58, was kidnapped at the university gates in Moslem west Beirut,
which had become a hunting ground for kidnap gangs seeking foreign
victims.
   ``We kind of expected it,'' his brother Thomas, 63, said in
Norristown, Pa. ``We tried to keep him from going to Beirut, but he
had made up his mind.''
   The decade before his abduction was one of great change for
Joseph Cicippio.
   In the early 1970s, he was a Norristown bank manager, with seven
children, who led a Veterans of Foreign Wars drum and bugle corps.
   His travels began after his 20-year first marriage ended in 1974
and a second broke up a few years later.
   ``I think at the time he had a lot of things on his mind, just
wanted to get things sorted out,'' said his first wife, Theresa.
``At the time, it appeared to me he just wanted to get as far away
as he could.''
   Family members say he worked for a helicopter company in
Pennsylvania's Bucks County, was a shipping manager in Jidda, Saudi
Arabia, then for a hotel in London.
   He took the job at American University in 1984, after a brief
stay in California.
   ``None of us wanted him to go, but ... he had applied for the
job and this is what he wanted,'' his brother said. ``He was used
to working overseas.
   ``In my view he should have had some fear, because we were all
very concerned, but he was the type of person, once he made up his
mind to do something, he did it.''
   Joseph Cicippio was born in Norristown on Sept. 13, 1930, the
youngest of nine children in a Roman Catholic family. His father
worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad.
   He graduated from Norristown High School and attended banking
classes at the University of Pennsylvania, Bucknell and Rutgers but
did not receive a degree.
   Cicippio served in the Army in the early 1950s and, when he left
Norristown, was assistant vice president in charge of an American
Bank branch.
   In 1985 in Beirut, Cicippio married Elham Ghandour, a
25-year-old Lebanese secretary at the U.S. Embassy. He was
kidnapped shortly before he had planned to take her to the United
States.
   Helen Fazio, a sister, said he had a lot of work to do that day
and had left for the university an hour early.
   His lawyer, James J. Oliver, said Cicippio sometimes joked in
letters about the dangers of Beirut.
   ``If things get too bad, I may not have any time to do anything
but just run,'' he wrote on March 25, 1985.
   ``The war has been getting hotter in the last two weeks. Have
not been off the campus in four weeks. The university feels I could
get kidnapped because of my position. Nonetheless, it's safer than
living in N.Y. (Ha. Ha.).''
   On Feb 18, he told Oliver: ``I am well, still ducking from the
bombing and bullets flying all over the place. I hope to be in the
U.S.A. sometime in June.''

<HEAD>U.N. Chief: Namibian Counterinsurgency Forces Unfit for Duty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Thursday that South African-trained police in Namibia are
intimidating the civilian population and should be dismissed from
duty.
   The U.N. chief said the territory's independence plan is on
track, but the biggest problem is the presence of members of the
counterinsurgency force, called Koevoet, in the Namibian police
force.
   Koevoet, which means ``crowbar'' in Afrikaans, was a force
organized by South Africa to fight guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization, the main group that fought for the
country's independence.
   Koevoet was disbanded last year under the U.N. plan for
Namibia's transition to independence from nearly 75 years of South
African rule, but most of its members joined the South-West Africa
Police.
   ``In the years preceding implementation of the United Nations
plan, Koevoet had earned an evil reputation in northern Namibia,''
Perez de Cuellar told the Security Council in a private briefing. A
copy of his remarks was obtained by The Associated Press.
   U.N. officials in Namibia have ``clearly established that
ex-Koevoet elements in the South-West Africa Police have not
adjusted to the new political situation in Namibia and have
continued to harass and intimidate the civilian population,'' he
said.
   ``They are not suitable for continued employment in the police
force under the terms of the United nations plan,'' said Perez de
Cuellar.
   Under the U.N. plan, however, South Africa's
administrator-general, Louis Pienaar, is responsible for civil
administration in Namibia. Pienaar has said he will not fire
ex-Koevoet members outright but will investigate specific charges
of mistreatment.
   The United Nations has more than 5,000 soldiers and policemen in
the territory, but their role is largely supervisory.
   The chief U.N. administrator in Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said
that officials who are trying to retrain the 2,000 former Koevoet
members say 85 percent of them are illiterate and ``unable to take
down a citizen's complaint or a crime report.''
   Perez de Cuellar said the second major problem relates to South
Africa's fear that the guerrillas will invade northern Namibia from
their bases in Angola.
   More than 1,600 armed guerrillas did enter the north in early
April, apparently in an attempt to surrender themselves to U.N.
peacekeepers. Hundreds of guerrillas and dozens of Namibian
security forces died in patched battles before calm was restored.
   The U.N. chief said he had instructed his officials in Angola to
make sure all guerrillas stay in their bases, about 90 miles north
of Angola's border with Namibia.
   Perez de Cuellar was briefing the Security Council in closed
session on his mid-July tour of Namibia and meetings with South
African officials in Pretoria.
   The guerrilla movement has suspended its 23-year-old war and is
now a legal political party in Namibia.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since World War I, agreed
to the U.N. independence plan under the terms of a regional peace
accord signed in December.

   The U.S. Court of International Trade imposed
a record $34 million fine Thursday against a South Korean steel
manufacturer for alleged customs-fraud violations, the Justice
Deparment said.
   The department said the fine against Daewoo Corp. and its U.S.
subsidiary, Daewoo International (America) Corp., ``essentially
reflects a settlement agreement'' negotiated by the government and
the company.
   The judgment, entered by the trade court in New York, is a
result of civil lawsuit charging customs-law fraud in connection
with steel imports from 1980 through 1982. The civil case was filed
after the company pleaded guilty in 1985 to criminal violations in
connection with nine steel importations.
   The lawsuit accused the company of routinely giving the U.S.
Customs Service false declarations of the price of steel it was
shipping to the United States to avoid paying duties for
``dumping'' the product at low prices.
   The civil investigation found about 800 alleged violations in
connection with 235 importations of steel, the department said.
   The largest customs penalty before Thursday's fine was a $25
million fine imposed in 1982 on Volkswagen U.S.A.

   Non-Communist Southeast Asia
leaders are disappointed by talks in Paris to end 10 years of war
in Cambodia but still hope for a peaceful settlement, Malaysia's
prime minister said Thursday.
   The foreign ministers of 19 countries, who met this week in
Paris, set up working committees to help monitor Vietnam's
withdrawal from Cambodia and an ensuing cease-fire, deal with
sovereignty questions and plan for repatriation of refugees.
   But talks between Cambodian Premier Hun Sen and leaders of the
three-party Cambodian resistance alliance led by Prince Norodom
Sihanouk reached an impasse July 25 after two days of negotiations.
   The talks were aimed at bringing warring Cambodian factions
together and ensuring peace after Vietnam withdraws its troops from
Cambodia, which it has occupied since December 1978.
   ``We are a little bit disappointed,'' said Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohammed. ``But we are realistic people. We know
we can't resolve things by sitting and looking at each other. More
discussions are needed.''
   Mahathir made the statement between meetings with Indonesian
President Suharto, President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines and
Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew of Singapore.
   Mahathir is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Chatichai
Choonhavan of Thailand when the Thai premier visits Malaysia on
Friday.
   Southeast Asian leaders were gathered here for Wednesday's rites
symbolizing the ``coming of age'' of the eldest son of Brunei's
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah.
   Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand are
Brunei's partners in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations _
the main proponents of the Paris conference.
   ASEAN, China, the United States and other Western countries back
Sihanouk's alliance, which includes the Khmer Rouge, whom the
Vietnamese drove from power.
   Vietnam does not want the Khmer Rouge, blamed for slaughtering
hundreds of thousands of Cambodians during their three years in
power, to play a major role in any new government.
   In Paris, Hun Sen blamed the faction for the breakdown in talks
among the various Cambodian factions. He said the Khmer Rouge
refuses to resume the talks.
   ``This is a problem that cannot be resolved overnight or over
one month,'' Mahathir said. ``We've been working on it for years.''
   A spokesman for Suharto told reporters earlier that the
Indonesian president and Mahathir agreed during their meeting that
prospects for peace in Cambodia remain good.
   But the spokesman, Moerdiono, would not elaborate. He said
Mahathir and Suharto agreed to meet again in Bali later this year
to review the Cambodian situation and discuss other issues.

   AZT, the only government-approved anti-AIDS
drug, significantly slows progression of the disease when given to
people with early symptoms according to result from a new clinical
trial, officials said Thursday.
   The drug was approved for use in people with AIDS, but new trial
results for the first time show that AZT also benefits patients
with early symptoms of infection with the human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS.
   Results were so good the trial has been stopped and patients on
placebo offered the drug instead.
   The finding could potentially benefit an estimated 100,000 to
200,000 people with early symptoms of HIV infection, said Dr.
Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases.
   ``It also emphasizes how critical it is that persons at risk for
HIV infection be tested and seek prompt medical care,'' Fauci said.
   ``This is real good news,'' said Frank Young, commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration, which he said will work quickly
``to translate these important results into wider availability of
zidovudine (AZT)'' for earlier treatment of the disease.
   The trial has been underway in 29 locations since August 1987,
according to an announcement late Thursday by the Department of
Health and Human Services, the parent of both NIAID and FDA.
   The trial included 713 HIV-infected people who had one or two
HIV associated symptoms, such as oral thrush, chronic rash or
intermittent diarrhea, and levels of immune system cells, called T4
cells, between 200 and 800 per cubic millimeter. Some participants
received placebos and some received AZT over a period of three to
20 months.
   As of July, 50 of the participants had progressed to
AIDS-related complex or AIDS. Of these, 36 had been taking placebos
and 14 were on AZT.
   Fewer than 5 percent of the participants experienced serious
side effects from the AZT, said Margaret Fischl, a doctor at the
University of Miami, who coordinated the trials.
   ``This study clearly shows that early intervention is important
in HIV infection and that zidovudine is well tolerated in persons
with early ARC (AIDS-related complex),'' she said.
   On the recommendation Wednesday from the Data and Safety
Monitoring Board reviewing the trial data, Fauci stopped the trial
because the results were so promising. He said all study
participants now will be offered AZT.
   AZT is manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Co. and is marketed
under the trade name Retrovir. It was approved in March 1987 for
treatment of AIDS patients who had recovered from Pneumocycstis
carinii pneumonia _ the leading killer of people with AIDS _ and
patients with advanced ARC.
   Young said: ``We pledge to analyze the data as rapidly as
presented to us so that we can make the appropriate recommendations
to practicing phsicians.
   ``It is important to emphasize in the meantime that physicians
do have the capability of prescribing drugs for different uses than
are on the label, and we fully recognize this. On the other, hand
we know the medical community relies on the analysis by FDA and we
want to complete this as expeditiously as possible,'' he said.
   In another AIDS development Thursday, the FDA licensed the first
diagnostic kit to detect the presence of HIV by detecting the
proteins, or antigens, of the virus. Other licensed kits detect the
presence of the body's response, the antibody, to these proteins.
   The kit is designed to help physicians monitor changes in the
infection rate of people with the virus. The kit is not recommended
for use in screening blood or plasma donations.

<TEXT>
   Up to 30,000 Gypsy fundamentalists
opened a conference Thursday to celebrate a Bible-thumping
Protestantism they say has made them and their lifestyle more
acceptable to a still-wary outside world.
   More than 4,000 caravans, mobile homes and circus wagons are
camped on the outskirts of Amsterdam for the four-day World
Conference of Christian Gypsies.
   The four-day gathering will include twice-daily services, dozens
of prayer sessions and plenty of fire-and-brimstone preaching,
according to the organizers, the French-based Life and Light
mission.
   The Rev. Charles Welty, a Life and Light pastor, said that
despite the aura of conservative respectability, many old Gypsy
traditions remain, including some that are likely to raise frowns
among more conventional churchgoers.
   ``We're first of all Gypsies. When a French Gypsy gets together
with a Dutch Gypsy, it's not a Frenchman and a Dutchman meeting
each other, it's two Gypsies,'' Welty said.
   Most of the world's 40 million Gypsies are Roman Catholics. But
in 1951, Life and Light began an evangelical movement among
European Gypsies that now claims 100,000 members, the Paris-based
preacher told The Associated Press over a beer outside his
26-foot-long caravan.
   Like other fundamentalist Protestants, the Life and Light
Gypsies insist that a personal acceptance of Jesus and strict
adherence to the Bible's teachings are essential to a believer's
salvation.
   But they have maintained their wandering lifestyle, and most
still work as tinkers, musicians or itinerant salesmen, said the
burly, mustachioed Welty as his wife was doing household chores.
   In the 5,000-seat tent that dominates the campsite, a group of
elders debated the day's business. Others sat around a campfire,
played the guitar or repaired their Mercedes limousines. Dogs and
chickens strutted around everywhere, and children cavorted in the
mud or played chess.
   Welty, 48, maintained that acceptance of the Gospel ``has helped
us to make ourselves better known'' to the outside world. ``We have
preached in their churches and they've been among us. It's removed
prejudices.''
   He added that the Gypsy tradition of fortunetelling has fallen
by the wayside among converts because it is regarded as the work of
the devil, but said another custom has survived in an adapted form.
   Under Gypsy law, a couple get married by the simple act of
eloping and staying away for four days. They still do today, but
marry formally before a minister and civil authorities after the
wedding is consummated, Welty said.
   Conventionally minded Protestant preachers ``are a little
shocked because it's not their way of getting married,'' Welty
said. ``When Abraham married Sarah, they didn't go to the mayor's
office either.''

<TEXT>
   Former death row inmate Randall Dale Adams
settled his lawsuit against the man who helped free him, ``The Thin
Blue Line'' filmmaker Errol Morris, by getting the rights to his
life story, attorneys said Thursday.
   Adams, whose conviction of killing a Dallas police officer was
questioned in Morris' film, will receive full rights to any
commercial movies or books about his life, according to the
settlement. Charges against Adams ultimately were dismissed.
   Adams, now living in Ohio, sued Morris in Houston District Court
on June 22 for rights to the story, which depicted his account of
his arrest and conviction for the murder of a Dallas officer Robert
Wood.
   Both sides expressed relief over the settlement Thursday, and
each blamed the other for what they termed an unnecessary legal
action by Adams.
   ``I'm pleased that we were able to settle this, but I'm not
pleased with the way it had to come about. It never should have
gone to litigation,'' Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer said.
   ``After being a prisoner of the justice system for 12 years, Mr.
Adams should not have been required to be a prisoner of Errol
Morris for life,'' Schaffer said.
   Morris' attorneys released a statement from the Cambridge,
Mass., filmmaker, in which he said he had agreed to return the book
and commercial movie rights to Adams.
   As part of the agreement, Morris said, Adams dropped his demand
that he be paid $60,000 for ``The Thin Blue Line,'' although
Schaffer said Thursday that was never part of the lawsuit.
   ``Nothing can erase the terrible tragedy of what happened to
Randall Adams in Dallas in 1976 and in his subsequent 13 years of
imprisonment,'' Morris said. ``It is my hope that both of us can
now return to our lives and that we can put this lawsuit behind
us.''
   The case was transferred to U.S. District Judge Lynn Hughes'
court June 30, and settlement negotiations continued for about a
month before all parties completed signing the agreement Wednesday,
attorneys said.
   Adams was freed from state prison in March after an appeals
court overturned his conviction earlier this year, and Dallas
County prosecutors declined to retry him.
   The former inmate's lawsuit asked for a judgment on who owned
the rights to his life story.
   A written agreement between Adams and Morris said that Adams was
owed $10 if Morris produced a documentary about Adams, or $60,000
and 2 percent of profits if a commercial film was produced.
   Schaffer had contended that ``The Thin Blue Line,'' although
produced in a documentary style, was actually a commercial film.
The film was released in commercial theaters around the country.
   ``I was unwilling to pay money to Adams for ``The Thin Blue
Line,'' a documentary motion picture for which I received no
profits and for which I am still approximately $100,000 in debt,''
Morris said in his statement Thursday.
   ``I am relieved that this lawsuit has been settled,'' Morris
said. ``In my opinion, it was unnecessary and uncalled for. It has
never been my intention to deprive Randall Adams of the opportunity
to make money from his life story.''
   Schaffer said the lawsuit became necessary because Morris
refused to yield rights to Adams despite attempts at a friendly
resolution.
   Adams has received numerous letters of inquiry from filmmakers
and writers interested in his story, and those materials were
packaged and mailed to him Thursday, Schaffer said.
   ``He has retained the William Morris agency to represent him in
those matters,'' Schaffer said. ``I assume he will end up striking
a deal with somebody. There has been a substantial amount of
interest.''

<HEAD>Circuit Judge Holds Illinois AIDS Testing Law Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state law requiring criminals convicted of
sex-related offenses to be tested for AIDS was struck down as
unconstitutional Thursday by a Cook County circuit judge.
   Judge Patrick Morse upheld the right of two Chicago prostitutes
to refuse to submit to the test, ruling that the law amounted to
unwarranted search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment
of the U.S. Constitution.
   The women had pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation of
prostitution.
   The law, approved by the Illinois General Assembly in 1987, took
effect last year. , was one of a number passed by state lawmakers
in recent years to deal with the spread of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome.
   Al Tomaso, who prosecuted the case, said no decision had been
made on whether to appeal the decision, but defense attorneys in
the case said he had advised them there would be an appeal.
   State Rep. Ralph C. Capparelli, one of the sponsors of the
legislation, said he found it difficult to understand why the judge
would not allow mandatory testing of prostitutes.
   ``Prostitutes are out there making business and they pass the
disease,'' he said. ``It's just one way of trying to control the
disease.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union called medical experts who
testified the law would not prevent the spread of AIDS.
   ``When someone listens to what an expert evaluation really is of
forced testing, then it's quite clear that kind of approach is
almost never useful,'' said ACLU attorney John Hammell.
   ``Women in prostitution don't want to die from AIDS, either.
Condom use among prostitutes is extremely high.''
   Fred Wellisch, an assistant Cook County public defender who also
worked on the case, said the state law was weak in that there was
no reasonable basis to suspect the prostitutes had AIDS.
   ``It was just the fact these people fell into a
classification,'' he said.
   Under the law, a judge must order the AIDS test if a person was
convicted of any of 13 sex-related offenses. The judge had the
discretion to release the results if deemed in the public interest.
   Thursday's ruling comes as Gov. James R. Thompson is considering
whether to sign legislation repealing a 1988 law that requires
couples to be tested for AIDS before being issued a marriage
license.
   A spokeswoman for the governor said Thompson had no immediate
comment on the judge's decision.

<TEXT>
   Botswana's president was named a co-winner
of the 1989 Africa Prize for Leadership for having prevented famine
in his nation during the 1981-1987 drought.
   President Quett K.J. Masire shares the prize with Dr. Bernard
Ledea Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso. Ouedraogo, an anti-hunger
activist, heads grass-roots organizations that involve more than
500,000 people in nine countries.
   The New York-based Hunger Project, which awards the prize, said
not a single person died of starvation during Botswana's seven-year
drought, the worst in that country's history.
   During the seven years, Masire actually managed to reduce hunger
in his country, the project said.
   Before the drought, 25 percent of Botswana's children were below
average weight. By 1987, the figure had fallen to less than 15
percent.
   Infant mortality in Botswana _ now at 72 deaths for every 1,000
live births _ is the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Ouedraogo has organized more than 500,000 peasants to end hunger
through self-reliance and development.
   He heads the Naam movement and programs that teach peasant
farmers agricultural techniques, reforestation methods, road
building and how to improve health care. They also give villagers
literacy training.
   The program is active in Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia,
Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal and Togo.
   The $100,000 prize is to promote the winner's work.
   The Africa Prize For Leadership award was instituted two years
ago by the non-profit organization. About 5.4 million volunteers
and staff in 152 nations are helping the Hunger Project try to
abolish hunger worldwide, organizers said.
   Last year, President Robert G. Mugabe of Zimbabwe won the prize,
while in the previous year, the award went to President Abdou Diouf
of Senegal and professor Thomas R. Odhiambo of Kenya, a specialist
in insect studies.

<HEAD>House Extends Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Thursday to make permanent the
ban on cigarette smoking on airline flights lasting two hours or
less, a restriction the tobacco industry fought two years ago but
now sees as preferable to threatened broader limits.
   The measure would prevent the current ban, which covers four out
of five domestic U.S. flights, from expiring as scheduled in April.
   In a victory for the cigarette industry, however, anti-smoking
forces were blocked from adding language that would have spread the
prohibition to all domestic flights.
   ``This is probably the most popular bill we've passed around
here in two years,'' said Rep. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., sponsor of
both the existing and the new restrictions.
   The extended prohibition was contained in an $11.9 billion
transportation bill for fiscal 1990 that the House passed 366-50.
The measure will next be considered by the Senate, where an effort
is expected to broaden the smoking restrictions.
   The key fight on the smoking question occurred Wednesday, when
lawmakers adopted the ban on a 259-169 vote. That vote was a
procedural one that included other issues, but the cigarette
restrictions dominated the day's debate.
   When Congress enacted the initial ban two years ago, the tobacco
industry actively fought the proposal with claims that growers
would lose business and assertions that smoking was a health hazard
were unproven. The House approved the ban in 1987 by a slim 198-193
margin.
   This year, after early votes by House committees indicated that
lawmakers were not receptive to completely killing the
restrictions, the tobacco lobby decided it could live with a
permanent extension of the ban on two-hour flights. The industry
reasoned that making the restriction permanent would eliminate
opportunities for the ban to be expanded every time it expired.
   ``They counted noses,'' Durbin said of the tobacco industry's
tactics.
   Asked about the cigarette lobby's decision to do little to block
the permanent extension of the ban, Rep. Walter Jones, D-N.C.,
whose district relies heavily on tobacco growing, said Wednesday,
``This is the best compromise we can get.''
   The bill limits spending to $12 million for the program that
pays subsidies to airlines serving small communities. About $31
million is being spent this year on the program, a tiny portion of
the transportation budget that big-city lawmakers say is largely a
waste of money.
   The measure also provides $7.3 billion for the Federal Aviation
Administration, $960 million more than this year; $2.9 billion for
the Coast Guard, about $100 million more than 1989; $3.2 billion
for mass transit, and $615 million for Amtrak, which got $584
million this year.
   The bill provides $11.9 billion in new spending, but also allows
an additional $15.3 billion to be spent from revenues from various
user fees.

   Eleven people were killed and two injured when
stone columns and balconies collapsed at Kiev's main post office
during heavy rain, officials reported Thursday.
   Rescuers using cranes and clawing with bare hands completed
their search of rubble early Thursday and found no further victims

   The army daily Red Star quoted the Ukraine's interior minister,
Lt. Gen. Ivan Gladush, as saying dozens of people were sheltering
from the rain under the building's main entrance when the portico
gave way, piling concrete and bricks on them.
   The evening TV news program ``Vremya'' said the collapse
occurred on Kiev's main street, Kreshatik.
   The building, erected in the 1950s, had been under repair.
   ``Vremya'' said a commission was formed to investigate.

   President Desmond Hoyte on Thursday
said he will award free land to soldiers for their loyalty during
the last several months of strikes, shortages and food riots.
   The state-run Public Communications Agency quoted Hoyte as
saying during an annual retreat at the Guyanese Defense Force
headquarters in Georgetown that the army ``remains one of the
pillars of the country's democratic life.''
   The agency said his plan would involve providing free land to
soldiers to build private homes. It said the government also would
consider helping pay for building homes.
   The agency said Hoyte praised soldiers for remaining loyal
during what he said were ``obviously difficult economic times.''
   Guyana's economy has stagnated during the past decade. For
several months, the South American country has been plagued with
power outages that have led to food, water and fuel shortages.
   Austerity measures imposed in April, including a 70 percent
devaluation of the Guyanese dollar, sparked food riots and strikes
in the key bauxite and sugar industries. The devaluation prompted
300 percent increases in food prices.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday ordered a U.S. art
dealer to return to the Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus four 6th
century mosaics purchased for $1.1 million last summer in
Switzerland.
   U.S. District Judge James E. Noland said in his ruling that Peg
Goldberg of suburban Indianapolis never obtained proper title to
the artworks and has no right to possess them.
   ``The court finds that the evidence and testimony of the
plaintiffs is more credible and persuasive,'' Noland said. ``The
plaintiffs have made a proper showing in all respects for the
return of the mosaics.''
   ``We never had any doubts that the ... mosaics were unlawfully
stolen and illegally taken away from Cyprus,'' President George
Vassiliou said in a statement issued by the government news agency
in Cyprus.
   ``We always had confidence in the American courts and in that
sense we can say that the decision of the court comes as no
surprise, but it still fills us with joy, because it shows that
despite difficulties, despite adversity, justice at the end
prevails.''
   Michael E. Sherifis, who presented his credentials Thursday to
President Bush as the Cypriot ambassador to the United States,
called the mosaics ``an invaluable and integral part of our rich
cultural heritage.''
   ``It will have a great impact on the flow of stolen art around
the world,'' added June Walton, a Washington attorney for the
Cypriots. ``Certainly, it will make purchasers think twice before
they buy stolen art.''
   Ezra H. Friedlander, an Indianapolis attorney for Ms. Goldberg,
said his client was ``very upset.''
   ``She feels wronged by the decision,'' he said. ``She doesn't
think the decision reflected what the evidence presented.''
Friedlander said an appeal was likely.
   Goldberg, who is co-owner of Goldberg and Feldman Fine Arts Inc.
in Carmel, bought the mosaics in July 1988 from Aydin Dikman, a
Turk living in Germany who claimed he was a former archaeologist
for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.
   The mosaic fragments, each roughly 2 feet square, were taken
from a larger work on the ceiling of the Panagia Kanakarai Church
in Northern Cyprus in 1979, three years after Greek Cypriots fled
the area.
   Dating back to the year A.D. 525, the mosaics depict Christ as a
boy, the apostles James and Matthew and an archangel. They are
among only a few to have survived the rule of the Iconoclast
Byzantine emperors of the eighth century who ordered such images
destroyed.
   Ms. Goldberg borrowed $1.2 million from an Indianapolis bank to
purchase the mosaics. She paid $1.1 million for the art, then used
$120,000 to pay for the shipping and restoration of the mosaics,
which are stored in an Indianapolis bank vault. The rest of the
money was used to cover her expenses.
   Ms. Goldberg offered the mosaics last January to the J. Paul
Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., for $20 million. The museum's
curator, Marion True, contacted authorities in Cyprus, who said the
antiquities had been stolen, according to a deposition.
   The church and the Cypriot government filed suit against Ms.
Goldberg and her dealership last March. The trial began May 30 and
lasted six days.
   During the trial, Ms. Goldberg maintained that she bought the
mosaics in good faith and had tried to determine whether they were
stolen.
   She said the Cypriots had not notified Interpol, customs
officials in Europe or the United States, or the International
Foundation for Art Research that the mosaics were missing.
   Ms. Goldberg said she relied solely on IFAR, a New York
clearinghouse for information on stolen art, which had not
registered the mosaics as stolen property.
   Although Indiana law does not allow the purchase of stolen
property under any circumstances, Ms. Goldberg and her attorneys
claimed that Swiss law should apply to her case because she had
purchased the art in Switzerland. Swiss law allows the purchase of
stolen art if such transactions are made in good faith.
   Noland, however, ruled ``that Goldberg is not a good-faith
purchaser under Swiss law.''
   The judge said suspicious circumstances surrounding the sale of
the mosaics ``should have caused an honest and reasonaably prudent
purchaser ... to doubt whether the seller had the capacity to
convey property rights.''
   Noland also said Ms. Goldberg failed to conduct a reasonable
inquiry to learn whether the art work was stolen.
   Noland said in his ruling that further proceedings might be
needed to determine damages, any remaining claims and the transfer
of the mosaics.

<HEAD>U.S. Grants Haiti $10 Million Worth Of Wheat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ The United States granted Haiti $10
million worth of wheat on Thursday in the first resumption of
direct U.S. aid since violence aborted the 1987 elections,
state-run television said.
   Television Nationale d'Haiti said the Food for Peace Program
grant of 45,000 tons of wheat was signed by Cooperation Minister
Theophile Roche and Gerald Zarr, director of the Haiti office of
the U.S. Agency for International Development.
   The government will sell the wheat locally and the proceeds will
be used to ``fulfill the expectations of the socially and
economically disadvantaged population of urban and rural zones,''
Roche said.
   The money will finance an emergency program which includes
promotion of agricultural production through soil conservation,
irrigation and rural road building projects.
   ``This agreement indicates the veritable support of the American
government for change in Haiti and for the continuation of the
democratic process,'' Zarr said during the ceremony, broadcast by
state TV.
   The United States suspended two thirds of its $90 million annual
aid package to Haiti right after the Nov. 29, 1987 elections were
aborted by gunmen who, with army protection, killed at least 34
voters at polling stations.
   Thursday's signing was the first U.S. aid to Haiti since then,
Zarr said.
   He said the agreement ``will be a really positive step toward
the resumption of more substantial aid.''
   Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril, who came to power in a soldiers' revolt
in September, has pledged to return Haiti to democratic rule. The
soldiers ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy, who came to power when
dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in 1986.

<DATELINE>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police officers from throughout the country
voted Thursday to back legislation being considered by Congress to
restrict ownership of military assault weapons, as long as officers
could still buy them.
   ``This is not gun control but common-sense gun legislation to
protect the police and the citizens,'' Dewey Stokes of Columbus,
Ohio, national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, said
after the vote.
   ``There are some of our brothers who have not yet had this
problem, and I hope they never do,'' Stokes added. ``But we have to
do what we can do to help our brothers and sisters who face these
weapons.''
   It was an emotional issue for the delegates at the group's 49th
biennial convention. Although all outsiders were barred from State
Fair Arena while resolutions were debated, it was possible for
people outside to hear some of the arguments.
   At one point, after the assault weapons resolution was declared
adopted, some of the delegates roared a demand for a count of
hands. After minutes of confusion and shouts from the floor, a
decision was made to pass by the resolution so delegates could
study it further.
   It was brought back up more than an hour later and passed on
what sounded like a very close voice vote.
   ``I think that once they realized that this would not prevent
their brother officers from purchasing such weapons, many of them
changed their minds,'' Stokes said.
   ``They're coming across the border with military weapons,''
argued Duane Wilson from Pima County, Ariz., who said he and his
fellow officers had to patrol thousands of miles infested by drug
smugglers.
   Wilson said his county, which covers nearly 10,000 square miles,
probably was the nation's No. 3 area for illegal drugs imports
``and a number of our officers already have purchased assault
weapons. A lot more are going to have to.''
   In addition to approving restrictions on the ownership, transfer
or sale of assault weapons, the delegates easly adopted resolutions
calling for a seven-day waiting period for the purchase of guns and
opposing any weakening of current laws dealing with ownership of
machine guns and silencers.
   And they went on record for a boycott of any music group that in
their songs advocated assaults on police.
   The resolution originally was targeted only toward a rap music
group known as NWA. The delegates were told that one of that
group's songs called on young people ``to go out and kill a cop.
...''
   After one delegate heatedly called the original resolution
racist, it was amended to cover any group that advocated assaults
on police. The amendment also called on police to refuse to provide
security for such groups.

   Troops opened fire on an opposition
demonstration at the University of Panama Thursday, killing one
student and wounding at least six people, university and hospital
sources said.
   The Defense Forces would not comment on the incident.
   Witnesses said the confrontation took place during a rally by
about 100 students who want the results of a May 7 election
recognized. The students were protesting a proposal by the
Organization of American States for a new national election.
   International observers had said the opposition candidate
Guillermo Endara was winning the May 7 election by a 3-1 margin
when the government, controlled by Defense Forces chief Antonio
Manuel Noriega, stopped vote tallying and voided the election.
   Witnesses said demonstrators threw rocks at riot troops and the
troops opened fire.
   Hospital and university sources said a 24-year-old man shot at
very close range with birdshot died at nearby Bella Vista Clinic.
They said at least six other demonstrators were wounded.
   The witnesses and the officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A negotiating team from the OAS is in Panama trying to help
resolve the election. The opposition wants recognition of its
electoral victory and Gen. Noriega's departure from power.
   Noriega was indicted in Florida in February 1988 on drug
trafficking and money laundering charges, which he denied.
President Eric Delvalle tried to fire Noriega as Defense Forces
chief following the U.S. charges, but Noriega maneuvered to have
the National Assembly dismiss Delvalle, who the United States still
recognizes as president.
   The United States imposed economic sanctions on Panama, among
other measures aiming to force Noriega from power.

   An Olympic Airways plane with 34 Greeks
aboard crashed into a mountainside in thick fog on Thursday on the
eastern Aegean island of Samos, officials reported. A search found
no survivors.
   The twin-engine, British-built Short aircraft was on a 290-mile
domestic flight from Salonica, northern Greece to Samos, off
Turkey's western Anatolian coast. It carried 31 passengers,
including an infant, and three crew.
   The propeller-driven plane gave no sign of trouble before
disappearing from radar screens, officials said.
   Transport and Communications Minister Nikos Gelestathis said
commandos reported finding wreckage, bloody clothes and smashed
suitcases on Krounies mountain. Helicopters with medical teams were
ordered to fly to the rugged terrain to assist in search efforts.
   Gelestathis said that the chief of the army general staff, Gen.
Dimitri Veryvakis, was in radio contact with the search teams on
the mountain.
   They reported no survivors were found and that one part of the
plane was found split in half, with wreckage scattered over a wide
area, according to the minister.
   The military teams discovered the crash site after a shepherd
reported seeing an explosion on the mountain. A Greek air force
officer vacationing on Samos confirmed the shepherd's account.
   Gelestathis said troops would search for bodies throughout the
night.
   Earlier, the minister said he did not rule out the possibility
of terrorism ``since the piot gave no indication of any problems.''
But an official at Athens airport, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, later said the pilot apparently flew into the mountain
while blinded by the fog.
   The Athens airport duty officer, Emmanuel Fragiadakis, said the
control tower lost contact with the plane at about 4:55 p.m., an
hour after it left Salonika.
   It was scheduled to land on Samos at 5:30 p.m.
   The plane disappeared from radar screens when it was 25 miles
northwest of Samos.
   Olympic officials said the pilot, Petros Moutzoureas, was a
veteran with an excellent flight record.
   They said the aircraft was bought in 1981 and was used for
flights between the islands.

   Hurricane Dean veered away from the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Thursday, carrying its 85
mph winds farther out to sea and reducing the threat to the Florida
coast, forecasters said.
   They said the season's second hurricane would probably sweep 150
miles north of Puerto Rico on its way up the Atlantic Ocean.
   The National Weather Service lifted hurricane and flood warnings
for all the islands of the eastern Caribbean, including the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico, where authorities had begun putting
emergency measures into effect.
   The Puerto Rican National Guard canceled plans to evacuate 2,000
people from flood-prone areas.
   A hurricane watch was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands, a
British colony at the southern tip of the Bahamas chain, 550 miles
south of Miami. A watch, which is less serious than a warning,
means hurricane conditions could pose a threat to coastal or inland
communities.
   Dean turned toward the Bahamas but was expected to resume its
northwesterly course out to sea later Thursday, the weather service
reported.
   At 9 p.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was at latitude 20.1 north
and longitude 64.0 west, or 175 miles northeast of San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Dean was moving northwest at 5 mph.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., said Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands could
get some heavy rain and gusting winds, ``but no real problems.''
   ``The biggest problem in the islands is usually flash floods and
mudslides, so there is some potential for that,'' he said, ``but
it's not going to be as if the core of the storm was coming across
there.''
   Sheets said the storm, which had been heading toward Florida,
was curving to the north, away from land, and did not pose an
immediate threat to the U.S. mainland.
   ``It is not a problem for the next two to three days and
probably will not become a problem,'' he said. ``There is still a
chance it might get blocked and turned back to the west, but that's
unlikely at this moment.''
   The storm strengthened overnight as it zigzagged west-northwest
of the Leeward Island chain, missing the nearest island, Barbuda.
   Repeated warnings on television and radio that Dean was headed
for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico caused a shopping rush as
people stocked up on food, drinking water and buckets, batteries,
candles and tape.
   In San Juan, a city of 1.1 million people, the windows of many
houses and condominiums were taped or boarded up, and some
businesses closed.
   Government workers on both U.S. islands at first were given the
day off, but later those in the Virgin Islands were told to report
for work.
   Dean grew into a tropical storm Monday night.

<HEAD>Political Parties Say Would Back Debt Moratorium</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen major political parties said
Thursday they would back emergency measures to reduce Brazil's $112
billion foreign debt, including a new suspension of payments.
   In a 30-point document, the party leaders urged President Jose
Sarney to negotiate a reduction of both debt principal and interest
with international creditors.
   ``If an accord with creditors cannot be reached, the government
will have the political backing to declare an immediate suspension
of payments,'' the document said.
   Brazil, with the developing world's largest debt, is negotiating
an economic agreement with the International Monetary Fund that
will allow the country to receive more than $4 billion in new loans.
   Banks have balked at giving new money to Brazil, which is in
financial straits with 1,000 percent annual inflation. But the
country needs new money to meet an interest bill of $2.3 billion
due in September.
   Party leaders supported Sarney's decision in early July to
suspend debt interest payments to keep the country's money reserves
above ``an adequate level.'' Brazil paid less than half the $812
million due between June 30 and July 3 to foreign governments,
according to the Central Bank.
   ``The Congress is not willing to impose more sacrifices on the
Brazilian people in order to pay the debt,'' said Sen. Franco
Montoro.
   In July, cash reserves rose nearly $1 billion to $6.5 billion,
in part because of the suspension.
   Signers of the document included members of the Brazilian
Democratic Movement Party, the nation's largest, and the National
Reconstruction Party, which is backing presidential front-runner
Fernando Collor de Mello. In November, Brazilians vote for
president for the first time since 1960.
   In February 1987, Brazil declared a moratorium on $70 billion of
its debt with private banks saying the country was broke. The
government resumed payments a year later.

<HEAD>Stump Sentenced to 5 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former chemist for Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory who was a fugitive for 20 months was sentenced
to five years in federal prison Thursday for swindling the
government out of $250,000.
   Ronald Stump, 50, also was ordered to repay the government his
$125,000 share of the money he got by faking a test result on an
electronic device bought by the U.S. Department of Energy.
   ``He does not fall into the category of a career criminal, yet
he participated in a very serious fraud,'' said U.S. District Judge
John Vukasin, who imposed the sentence sought by the prosecutor.
Vukasin described Stump as ``a very clever man, also very
manipulative.''
   Stump worked at the laboratory for 25 years before disappearing
in April 1987. He was arrested in December in Chandler, Ariz. The
FBI said he went to Mexico and worked as a water ski instructor and
bicycle tour leader at a resort before heading for Arizona.
   The FBI also said Stump held a top-level security clearance but
was not doing classified weapons work at the lab. ``There was no
reason to believe any (threat to) national security'' by Stump,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Rodolfo Orjales.
   Stump pleaded guilty to making a false statement involving a
test report he submitted to the lab in March 1983. It said a device
called a mass spectrometer was effective in analyzing radioactive
tritium.
   Stump has admitted that he split the $250,000 price with Quantum
Mechanics Corp., seller of the spectrometer. He also pleaded guilty
to tax evasion. No charges were filed against the company, whose
owner died in 1985.
   Orjales said the device never worked. Assistant Federal Public
Defender Debra DeLambert, Stump's lawyer, disagreed, saying Stump
was working with the spectrometer at the lab before he disappeared.
   ``He recognizes that he abused the trust Lawrence Livermore
Laboratory put in him,'' DeLambert told the judge, urging him to
put Stump on probation. Stump also made a brief statement, saying
he was sorry.
   Orjales also told the judge there was evidence Stump defrauded
the government of an additional $60,000 for various types of
equipment bought by the lab. In addition, Stump did not tell the
truth to investigators when asked whether other employees knew
about procurement fraud, the prosecutor said. No charges were filed
in connection with those allegations.
   Since the fraud, security has been tightened at the lab, and the
problem appears to have been solved, Orjales told reporters.

<HEAD>Kidnapped Coffee King Rescued by Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police stormed a hillside hideout Thursday and
rescued a Florentine businessman who was kidnapped by Sardinian
bandits nine weeks ago.
   Dante Belardinelli, 62, dubbed the ``coffee king'' by the
Italian press, was found blindfolded in a tent with his leg chained
to a tree.
   The coffee product distributor was abducted on May 30 as he
drove to his Tuscan villa.
   Police said they arrested a Sardinian shepherd, Costantino
Pintore, 36, who was guarding the tent with a sawed-off shotgun.
The hideout lay near Manciano in a hilly coastal area about 62
miles northwest of Rome.
   Belardinelli, looking haggard but flashing the ``V'' for victory
sign, hugged one of his police rescuers. He was taken by helicopter
to Rome police headquarters and met reporters after being examined
by a doctor.
   ``I'm so happy to be here,'' he said.
   Slices of both his ears were found July 23 in an envelope in a
bar in Bologna, along with a photo and a ransom demand, reportedly
for $3.7 million dollars.
   On Saturday, police killed two kidnappers in a highway shootout,
after disguising themselves as Belardinelli's relatives on their
way to pay the ransom. Two bandits escaped and four policemen were
wounded.
   A Florence magistrate said he ordered the ransom money
confiscated so the family couldn't pay. The government said it was
pursuing a hard line with the kidnappers to try to end a plague of
abductions.
   Many of the abductions are blamed either on the Calabrian Mafia,
known as the 'ndrangheta, or on Sardinian gangs, who work out of
the island or from Sardinian communities in west central Italy.
   Belardinelli said he was kept blindfolded throughout his
captivity.
   ``When I heard the sound of the helicopter I thought, `They're
finally here,''' he said, near tears, ``I shouted `I'm here!' and
they said `Who?' and I said, `What do you mean who? Me,
Belardinelli!'''
   On Wednesday, police arrested three brothers in connection with
Belardinelli's abduction and for investigation into other
abductions.

   About 350 fireworks accidentally exploded at the
same time on a barge off the port of Yokohoma, killing two
technicians and injuring seven others, police said Thursday.
   More than 100,000 spectators were watching an annual display
Wednesday night when one technician set off a charge on a skyrocket
aboard the 1,037-ton barge, berthed about 900 feet from a seafront
park, police said.
   They said the sudden blast ignited 350 other fireworks aboard
the barge. Police said those killed and wounded were fireworks
technicians.
   Kanagawa Prefectural Police spokesman Teruo Matoba said those
injured were taken by a coast guard boat to nearby hospitals in
Yokohama, 18 miles south of Tokyo, for treatment of burns and
bruises.
   Police were investigating.

   Cable News Network has reached an agreement to
use a Soviet satellite to blanket the world with CNN's signal.
   The satellite signal will cover an area from South Africa to
Norway and from Hong Kong to the Azores Islands off Portugal's
coast, boosting the cable channel's potential audience to 58
million households, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said Wednesday.
   CNN, part of Turner Broadcasting System, will use the Statsionar

satellites that broadcast the network to South America, Europe and
western Asia, he said.
   The signal will be beamed from Atlanta to a satellite over the
Atlantic Ocean, relayed down to Moscow and up to Statsionar 12.
   Haworth said CNN also is working on a deal to have its signal
broadcast for widespread use in Moscow, where currently it is
``only watched by the Soviet Television Authority, (Soviet
President) Mikhail Gorbachev and probably someone in the Kremlin.''

<HEAD>Japanese Firm Gives $85 Million to U.S. Hospital For Skin Research
Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's leading cosmetics maker has promised $85
million to Massachusetts General Hospital over the next 10 years to
establish a center to study skin diseases, the company and hospital
officials announced Thursday.
   The grant from Shiseido Co. will support basic studies of skin
biology as well as better ways to diagnose and treat skin
disorders. Specifically omitted, however, is testing or development
of commercial products, the hospital said.
   The project, to be called the MGH-Harvard Cutaneous Biology
Research Center, will be headed by Dr. John A. Parrish, the chief
of dermatology at Massachusetts General and chairman of dermatology
at Harvard Medical School.
   ``Considering its importance, the skin is relatively neglected
by the most modern capabilities of basic research,'' Parrish said.
   Parrish said a chief aim of the center will be ``to make a
meaningful, powerful and tangible difference in the prevention of
skin disorders, the treatment of abnormal skin and the maintenance
of symptom-free normal skin of pleasing appearance.''
   In a statement issued from Tokyo, Shiseido said the $85 million
will be invested over 10 years. Forty researchers, including five
Shiseido staffers, will do interdisciplinary research on skin, the
company said.
   Under the agreement, the hospital will patent inventions, but
Shiseido will have the first opportunity to license them and pay
royalties to the hospital. Massachusetts General also will decide
what research to undertake and where and when to publish reports on
its findings.
   The guidelines are similar to those set up eight years ago when
the hospital received $68 million from Hoechst AG of West Germany
to support a molecular biology department.
   ``The fruits of their studies will ultimately benefit people all
over the world,'' said Dr. J. Robert Buchanan, the hospital's
general director. ``More immediately, this center will be a boost
to the Massachusetts economy. New jobs and a major economic
infusion will result.''
   The center will be housed at the former Charlestown Navy Yard,
where the hospital has research laboratories.
   When fully operative, the center will employ about 100 people.
Shiseido is authorized under the agreement to have up to five
scientists performing research at the center.

<HEAD>EDs: New throughout, raising doubts of senators and adding closing
arguments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senators expressed doubts Thursday about
claims of innocence from U.S. District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of
Miami as a panel of 12 lawmakers in his impeachment trial finished
gathering evidence against him.
   ``I just have problems fitting together your actions,'' Sen. Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn., said as lawmakers asked their final questions
of the 52-year-old jurist accused to taking part in a $150,000
payoff plot.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the panel, expressed
doubts about the judge's explanation of how information may have
found its way from his Miami courtroom to a Washington lawyer
soliciting a bribe. He added: ``It seems to me this is a major
problem in our ability to believe your case.''
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he wondered if documents
Hastings offered in an effort to refute claims by prosecutors were
``an after the fact contrivance.''
   Lawmakers and lawyers stayed late Thursday for closing arguments
to enable the 12-member Senate panel to wrap up its work a day
before the scheduled start of the congressional recess, which will
last through Labor Day.
   A report on weeks of hearings by the panel is to be prepared for
offering to the whole Senate to lay groundwork for a vote on
removing Hastings from the federal bench and depriving him of his
$89,500 annual salary.
   Hastings was impeached by the House a year ago on charges of
plotting with Washington attorney William Borders to obtain a
$150,000 bribe, lying to a jury that acquitted him in 1983 and
improperly disclosing wiretap information.
   Borders, who unlike Hastings was convicted in the case, has
refused to testify before the panel. Lawmakers say the
once-politically influential attorney is risking jail for contempt.
``Here's a man who literally walked the corridors of the White
House,'' Lieberman remarked.
   In their closing arguments, prosecutors from the House of
Representatives battered away at Hastings' explanation that he knew
nothing of any bribery plot and that Borders claimed to be able to
influence his actions as a way of drumming up business.
   They said there was too much evidence to explain away and that
the explanations are not plausible. For example, Borders boasted to
an FBI undercover agent masquerading as a convicted racketeer that
he could make Hastings appear in any restaurant on any day and time
of the ``racketeer's'' choosing.
   Hastings did appear on schedule in the main dining room of the
Fontainebleu hotel in Miami Beach at 8 p.m. on Sept. 16, 1981. The
judge says Borders had merely invited him there for a social
meeting.
   Prosecutors note that the attorney set the time and place
without consulting Hastings, the judge made a reservation for two _
himself and a woman companion, and that he made little if any
effort to hunt for Borders when the attorney failed to show up.
   ``The tangled web of Alcee Hastings now unravels in the Senate
of the United States,'' declared Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., as
congressmen prosecuting the case made their closing arguments.
   Attorney Terence Anderson, defending Hastings, struck at what a
number of senators have conceded to be the circumstantial nature of
the evidence.
   ``This is a man who in my view is touched with greatness,''
Anderson declared. ``And you must decide _ are you satisfied _ is
there that degree of certainty on this occasion that you are
willing to say he should be thrust aside and consigned to infamy?''

   Zuo was stationed in North Korea as a member of the Chinese
delegation to the Korean Military Armistice Commission. China
fought on North Korea's side in the 1950-53 Korean War and is a

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration called Thursday's
reprieve in the threatened execution of hostage Joseph Cicippio
``an encouraging and hopeful development'' but said it did not
fulfill U.S. demands for the release of all the hostages.
   The announcement by Cicippio's captors lowered tensions at the
White House and elsewhere. But it appeared unlikely to lead to an
immediate recall of U.S. naval power converging on the eastern
Mediterranean, a precaution taken in the event Cicippio were killed
and President Bush ordered a military strike.
   ``I urge everyone to keep in mind, especially in regard to the
ships, that we still have a serious problem in the Middle East,''
said Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. Hostages are still being
held, he said, adding that he did not expect ``any quick changes''
in the military deployment.
   Earlier, Fitzwater said Bush had made preliminary decisions ``of
every kind'' about how the United States would respond if
terrorists killed Cicippio, following the reported Monday execution
of Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.
   Thursday was the threatened execution date of Cicippio by the
Revolutionary Justice Organization. However, 45 minutes before the
deadline, the radical group said it would spare his life
temporarily.
   The captors indicated Cicippio still could be killed ``within
days'' unless Israel met new, tougher terms, including release of
unspecified Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas. Originally, they
had demanded only the release of a Shiite Moslem cleric kidnapped
by Israel, Abdul Karim Obeid.
   Fitzwater, asked whether the United States was considering
seeking extradition of Obeid from Israel for trial in connection
with possible involvement in the kidnapping of Higgins, said, ``The
Justice Department, I am told, is looking into the case.''
   A federal law enforcement source said the FBI was reviewing
statutes to determine if the murder of Higgins was a violation of a
1986 anti-terrorist act.
   There was an obvious sense of relief in Washington that Cicippio
had been spared.
   ``I would guess just offhand ... it could ease the tensions,''
said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. ``It might give
diplomacy a chance to work.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said, ``We're
all gratified of course at the so-called extension.''
   Mitchell said that, ``The obviously proper and humane course of
action would be to release Mr. Cicippio and the other innocent
persons who are being held hostage and we hope very much that will
be the result.''
   At the White House, Fitzwater said, ``We regard this as an
encouraging and hopeful development.''
   ``But it still does not answer our continuing concern for
release of all hostages,'' Fitzwater said in a written statement.
``We urge that all parties in the region use whatever influence
they have to end the tragedy of hostage taking and to release those
remaining in captivity. And we express our appreciation to all
those who have been thus far trying to help.''
   Fitzwater said the president made telephone calls to at least a
dozen leaders in the Middle East and elsewhere over the past two
days.
   ``I don't think we had any signals from any of the heads of
state'' that Cicippio was about to be spared, the press spokesman
said.
   The U.S. diplomacy was aimed at friends and foes alike.
   Fitzwater said it was impossible to say what prompted the
reprieve for Cicippio. ``We certainly think the diplomatic
overtures made a difference but we can't read Hezbollah's mind and
they haven't told us,'' he said.
   Asked if the Soviet Union had been influential, he replied,
``It's difficult to say. We have had some feedback from the Soviets
that indicated they were sympathetic to the problem.''
   Fitzwater said the blitz of diplomatic contacts and intense
focus on the issue ``may open up some opportunity over the long
haul'' in resolving the hostage problem.
   ``It's impossible to point to any specific improvement but the
hope it it won't settle back to the way it was ... I don't think
we're back at square one,'' he said.
   As parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani was sworn in as Iran's
new president, the United States made an open appeal for his nation
to turn away from the radicalism of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Iran is believed to exert considerable influence over the
kidnappers in Lebanon.
   ``We certainly are hopeful that the elevation of Rafsanjani is a
positive sign for U.S. relations,'' said Fitzwater, adding,
however, that ``our optimism is very guarded.''
   Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, ``we are hopeful that his presence
would spell some opening for a changed relationship with the West
and feel there must be some cracks in the structure that Khomeini
created against the United States.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, asked about
Iran's role in the situation, indicated that authorities there were
trying to be helpful.
   ``We have been in touch with Iran through a variety of channels
and at this time have no reason to believe that Iran is not dealing
with this matter in a serious way,'' she said. She added that the
Soviet Union has tried to be helpful and that Syria has expressed a
similar desire.
   While insisting that Bush had not made a final decision about
military action, Fitzwater said, ``all of the foundation planning
has been done and consideration of every scenario has been taken.''
   Military sources, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
the aircraft carrier Coral Sea was within striking distance of
Lebanese shores, carrying some 65 planes, including FA-18 attack
fighters and A-6 bombers.
   The carrier's battle group was bolstered by the nuclear-powered
cruisers Mississippi and Virginia, as well as the Aegis cruiser San
Jacinto, also in the area.
   NBC News reported Thursday night that jets from the Coral Sea
were electronically sparring with air defense systems in Lebanon,
racing towards the coast to get Syrian batteries to turn on their
radar. That would enable spy plans to analyze the radar signals and
later use the same signals to jam the defense systems during an
attack.
   Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, a Pentagon spokesman, said, ``We
don't discuss operations. I can't confirm'' the network report.
   The New York Times said in Friday editions that Bush had ``all
but decided'' to attack terrorist strongholds in eastern Lebanon,
including the Baalbek base of 2,000 Iranian revolutionary guards,
if a hostage had been killed.
   A White House spokesman reached at home Thursday night, who
spoke only on condition of non-identification, said, ``To my
knowlegde that is not true'' but added ``we just don't discuss
those sorts of things.''
   The flagship of the 6th Fleet, the guided-missile cruiser
Belknap, was on station east of Crete, with fleet commander Vice
Adm. James D. Williams aboard, the sources said.
   Steaming towards Lebanon from the mid-Mediterranean was the
battleship Iowa, armed with 16-inch guns and bristling with Harpoon
and Tomahawk cruise surface-to-surface mssiles. The Tomahawks have
a range of some 450 nautical miles.
   The aircraft carrier America, which broke off its port call in
Singapore earlier this week, was headed across the Indian Ocean and
expected to be on station in the north Arabian Sea in about four
days, the sources said.
   That places the carrier, with about 85 planes, within range of
possible targets in the Persian Gulf and Iran, the sources said.

<TEXT>
   Romania has recalled its ambassador to
Budapest for consulations to protest a interview broadcast by
Hungarian television with exiled Romanian King Michael, state radio
said Thursday.
   The report did not say when Romania's ambassador, Traian Pop,
would return to Budapest.
   The move marked a blow to already strained relations between the
two Warsaw Pact countries over alleged discrimination against the
1.7 million-strong Hungarian minority in Romania.
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu also opposes Hungary's
economic and political reforms.
   Romania said the interview, part of which was broadcast on July
31, included ``anti-Romanian, anti-socialist and fascist-type
attacks against the independence and sovereignty of Romania.''
   The Hungarian Foreign Ministry said in a statement reprinted by
the state news agency: ``It is unacceptable that statements made by
the Hungarian media are viewed in Bucharest as reflecting official
Hungarian views.''
   Hungarian television on July 31 carried an excerpt from its
interview with the exiled monarch. The full program is scheduled to
be broadcast within the next two weeks.
   ``I have always, as a monarch, supported human rights and
restored the 1923 (Romanian) Constitution,'' which strengthened the
role of Parliament and stipulated some rights and freedoms, King
Michael said in a part of the interview in Romanian.
   ``The present leadership in Bucharest is an absolute monarchy, a
dynasty the members of which all rule at the same time, bleeding
the country dry.''
   The implication was that, by contrast, his was an enlightened
monarchy.
   King Michael toppled Romania's pro-Nazi leader Gen. Ion
Antonescu in 1944 and signed a peace treaty with the Allies. But
the communist-dominated government forced him to abdicate in 1947.
   The interview was recorded two weeks ago at King Michael's
residence outside Geneva.

   Sales of U.S.-made cars and light trucks sagged
5.5 percent in late July, and July sales of foreign-made vehicles
dropped 9.6 percent, compared with the same periods last year,
automakers reported Thursday.
   Despite the Big Three automakers' continued incentive programs,
their car and light truck sales fell 7.4 percent to an average
daily rate of 37,113 in the July 21-31 period, from 40,096 in late
July 1988.
   Late-July average daily sales for the eight companies producing
cars and trucks in the United States were 41,004, compared with
43,394 in late July last year. For the month, domestic car and
truck sales were up 0.9, an average daily sales pace of 39,512
vehicles, compared with 39,163 in July 1988.
   July sales of imported cars and trucks slipped 9.6 percent to an
average daily rate of 31,260 vehicles, compared with 34,590 in July
1988.
   ``The incentives have had less and less impact,'' said Joseph
Phillippi, an automotive analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in
New York. ``This is a tired market.''
   For the first seven months of the year, domestic car and truck
sales drooped 3.9 percent, while imported car and truck sales were
10 percent behind the same period of 1988.
   Last year was the second-best sales year in automotive history,
and the late-July sales rate was slightly above the average for
that year.
   Chrysler had the sharpest decline in car sales in late July this
year, a 15.5 percent drop to a daily rate of 3,049, from 3,611 a
year earlier. Chrysler car sales for the first seven months of 1989
were down 14.8 percent.
   GM said its late-July cars sales were down 13.1 percent to a
daily rate of 11,640 from a 13,394-a-day pace in that time last
year. GM car sales were down 8.9 percent for the year to date.
   Ford reported only a 0.2 percent decline to a daily rate of
7,860 for late July, from a rate of 7,873 a day in late July of
1988. Car sales for the first seven months of the year were down
2.4 percent, Ford said.
   For light trucks, GM said sales dropped 8 percent in late July
and 3.1 percent for the first seven months; Chrysler reported a 7.5
percent drop for the period and a 0.8 percent decline for the year
so far; and Ford said truck sales were off 3 percent for late July
and 3.1 percent for the first seven months.
   August sales may pick up, Phillippi said, as shoppers try to
avoid price increases coming when 1990 models are introduced in the
fall.

<HEAD>Playboy Folds Cable Channel to Launch Pay-Per-View Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Playboy Channel, the troubled
cable-television arm of Playboy Enterprises Inc., will be folded in
December and replaced with a new pay-per-view television service,
Playboy announced Thursday.
   Playboy also announced that it will launch a new one-hour
European television show this fall, titled ``Playboy Late Night.''
Because European broadcast standards are less stringent than those
in the United States, the magazine-formatted show will include
nudity but no explicit sex.
   Playboy has already reached agreements in principle with
television companies in Italy, France and Spain for ``Playboy Late
Night,'' said Christie Hefner, Playboy's chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``The name of game we think is to find multiple outlets for
product,'' Hefner said. ``And because Playboy has differentiated
product and a global trademark, we're in a pretty good position in
that regard.''
   Hefner said that launching a pay-per-view service with an entire
evening's entertainment for a flat fee was more economical than
retooling the company's struggling pay-subscription cable channel.
   ``There is much more opportunity for us by running a Playboy
service as a pay-per-view service than as a subscription service,''
she said. ``It's pretty obvious that the cable industry is not
perceiving the pay-subscription business as a growth business. No
one is launching new pay-subscription services.''
   Hefner said that the new Playboy service will be available in
2.5 million homes with pay-per-view capability, making Playboy the
third-largest pay-per-view service.
   The Playboy Channel, launched in November 1982, claims 400,000
subscribers, said Playboy spokesman Bill Farley. It has been
plagued by a high ``churn'' rate, in which cable subscribers sample
the service but drop it.
   Hefner said that Playboy's pay-per-view will run 10 hours a
night and feature original programming and ``quality'' R-rated
movies such as ``Crimes of Passion'' and ``Betty Blue.''

<HEAD>Bishops Alarmed At Deterioration of Political Situation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic bishops in this Central
American nation said Thursday that because of the political
violence coupled with labor unrest, ``Day by day Guatemala is
falling more deeply into chaos.''
   ``The paralyzing of essential services such as mail, telegraph,
education and public works (and) the violent death of a noted
politician are signs of a profound breakdown of the national
situation,'' the bishops' statement said.
   They recalled the bleak days of the early 1980s, when political
slayings by the hundreds and the military's bloody campaign against
foes or suspected foes of the government made Guatemala an
international pariah.
   ``Remembering the vivid horrors of only a few years ago and in
fear of returning to those tragic days, we turn to God in
humility,'' the bishops said.
   ``The only civilized way to find just and equitable solutions is
a frank, sincere and respectful dialogue.''
   About 50,000 government employees, including teachers and postal
workers, have been on strike for nearly two months for higher
wages. President Vinicio Cerezo has rejected the demands, saying
the government doesn't have the money.
   The strike has closed public schools nationwide and brought mail
service to a halt. Daily demonstrations by strikers have snarled
traffic in the capital and blocked border crossings into Mexico.
   The strike and the violence that followed it have raised fears
about the stability of Guatemala's fledgling civilian government.
   Cerezo's inauguruation in 1986 came after more than 30 years of
military or military-dominated rule in Guatemala. He has survived
two military coup attempts in 14 months and said recently he was
the target of a right-wing assassination plot.
   In the past few weeks, dozens of bombings and bomb threats and
several killings have hit this nation of about 9 million people,
including the slaying Tuesday of Danilo Barillas, a leader in the
governing Christian Democratic Party.
   Students sympathizing with the strikers on Thursday freed the
rector of the University of San Carlos, Roderico Seguro, and about
50 other university officials after holding them hostage for 24
hours.
   Hector Adolfo Cifuentes, the university secretary, said none of
the hostages were harmed.
   Fourteen public school teachers also ended an 18-day hunger
strike in Guatemala City's main plaza outside the National Palace.
   Mario Guillermo Munoz, a strike leader, told reporters they
ended their fast because ``they had made their point.'' The 14, on
the verge of collapse, were given first aid by Red Cross volunteers
and rushed to the hospital.
   Negotiations continued between strike leaders and government
officials without Cerezo, who walked out early Wednesday, saying he
was ``fed up.''
   Education Minister Ricardo Gomez Galvez said he was optimistic
about reaching an accord. Striking teachers said in a statement
they might consider going back to work if the government reinstated
500 fired strikers.
   The military on Thursday blamed Sunday's shooting death of
refugee leader Marco Juan Baltazar on leftist rebels.
   Baltazar represented repatriated Guatemalans on the National
Reconciliation Commission set up to discuss an end to the
27-year-old civil war, which has displaced tens of thousands of
people.

<HEAD>Six Plead Innocent in Nationwide Coupon Fraud Scheme</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABILENE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six people pleaded innocent Thursday to
conspiracy and mail fraud charges in a scheme in which $2 million
in counterfeit coupons from 47 major consumer product companies
were allegedly distributed nationwide. Four others indicted by a
federal grand jury agreed to plead guilty in their home states and
did not appear at Thursday's proceedings, officials said.
   The defendants face a maximum penalty of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine on each count. All were released on personal
recognizance bonds.
   Pleading innocent were James Floyd Richards of San Antonio;
David George Rackmill of Stamford; David Keith Rees of Center
Point; Connie Santos Arvidson of Boca Raton, Fla.; Peggy Joyce
Bunce of Deerfield Beach, Fla.; and Margaret McBrayer Goodman of
Kingsport, Tenn.
   The U.S. Postal Inspectors Service uncovered the scheme, in
which coupons for food and other products from the 47 consumer
product companies allegedly were printed and distributed from Texas.
   The 24-count indictment, handed down June 22, said that
beginning in June 1988, Rackmill advertised the coupons in a
circular mailed to hundreds of people after buying the fake coupons
from Rees, who had them printed by Richards.
   The three allegedly counterfeited 603,000 copies of 90 coupons
issued by the 47 manufacturers. The other defendants allegedly
purchased the coupons from Rackmill through the mail, according to
the 24-count indictment.
   U.S. Postal Inspector Sam Prose, who worked undercover in the
case and offered Rees coupons for Crisco shortening, said the
coupon purchasers participated in the conspiracy by using the
coupons to obtain large amounts of the products, then sell them at
flea markets.
   The coupons were similar to those offered by manufacturers to
customers in exchange for proof-of-purchase seals and were valued
between $1 and $10.89.
   Agreeing to plead guilty were Evelyn Christine Peoples of
Humphrey, Ark.; Carol Jean Juel of Fullerton, Calif.; Yvonne Suits
of Cambridge, Minn.; and James Patrick Caprose of Newcastle, Pa.

   In passing the $295 billion military
authorization bill, the Democratic-controlled Senate sets the stage
for a clash with the House over key elements of President Bush's
strategic weapons programs.
   The Senate, which approved the bill 95-4 Wednesday, left
relatively intact the dollars and the structure of the strategic
weapons programs. The House last week made deep cuts denounced by
the White House as irresponsible both in terms of national security
and arms control.
   ``In my judgment, this will be the most difficult conference in
a decade,'' said Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican
on the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``But I'm confident that we
can emerge with a bill which will meet the president's basic policy
goals.''
   ``It's going to be very difficult,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
the committee chairman. ``There are more profound differences with
the House than we have had for a long, long time.''

   Indictments of 46 commodities traders represent
only the opening salvo in the government's crackdown on corruption
at the world's two largest futures exchanges, according to the
prosecutor.
   ``This is an ongoing investigation, not a concluded
investigation,'' U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas told reporters
Wednesday.
   ``This is the first step in what we will be doing,'' he said,
adding the investigation ``will continue as long as there are
viable allegations of misconduct.''
   After a 2{-year undercover FBI investigation, 46 traders at the
Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange were accused
of systematically conspiring to skim profits from customer accounts
and attempting to hide earnings from the Internal Revenue Service.

   Passengers praised the pilot of a
Piedmont Airlines jet who brought the aircraft down safely after a
rubber wheel block jammed the landing gear _ and they thanked God
they were alive.
   ``I was praying, I had my rosary, I was saying Mass _ I just
knew we weren't going to crash,'' said Marie Fay of McLean, Va.,
who was chain-smoking and perspiring profusely after telephoning
relatives.
   ``God and the pilot were with us,'' she said.
   A Boeing 737-400, with 94 passengers and six crew members aboard
and piloted by a 20-year veteran who wasn't scheduled to make the
flight, came to a skidding halt with a wing and engine scraping the
runway Wednesday after its left landing gear failed to lower. No
one was injured.

   Some members of the Fraternal Order of
Police endorsed new restrictions on semiautomatic weapons. Others
were sticking by their guns as the organization prepared to vote on
gun control resolutions.
   ``It's a very emotional issue for this group and the delegates
are really polarized,'' Steve Cain, president of the Oklahoma
Fraternal Order of Police, said Wednesday.
   Some delegates _ many from Eastern cities _ expressed support
not only for restrictions but also for waiting periods on gun
purchases. Other delegates, however, backed the National Rifle
Association's blanket opposition to more gun controls. The NRA, a
national gun lobby, has more than 3 million members.
   One of the resolutions _ which could go to a vote today at the
organization's national convention _ would direct the FOP's
national legislative committee to support ``sensible'' legislation
on the sale of semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47, the Uzi and
the AR-15.

   Hauling garbage in the same trucks that carry
food to stores is like serving potato salad ``from your cat's
litter box,'' an educator says, but truckers say it's common and
food manufacturers want to put a stop to it.
   ``The idea of garbage being hauled in food trucks seems more
than disgusting,'' said Rep. William Clinger, R-Pa., who organized
a hearing Wednesday by a House Public Works subcommittee. ``It
seems dangerous.''
   ``Would you serve potato salad from your cat's litter box?''
asked Penn State University food science professor Manfred Kroger.
   Two truckers, testifying from behind a screen to conceal their
identities, told the subcommittee they hauled garbage in
refrigerated food trucks, which also are used to carry meat,
poultry, dairy products, fresh fruits and vegetables to market.
   Campbell Soup Co., Heinz U.S.A., Geo. A. Hormel &amp; Co., and
Hershey Chocolate U.S.A. are among at least a dozen food producers
taking steps in the last two months to ensure that their products
are not carried in the same trailers that haul waste to landfills,
according to correspondence from the firms released by the
subcommittee.

   Elaine Chao has always been comfortable with
numbers, but the highest ranking Asian-American in the Bush
administration says she's still learning to deal spontaneously with
the problems of running an agency with 100,000 employees.
   The deputy transportation secretary, who spoke no English when
she came to America as a third-grader in 1961 aboard a freighter,
went from a career in private banking to head the Federal Maritime
Commission. In February, she was nominated by President Bush to the
No. 2 job in the far-reaching Transportation Department.
   In her mid-30s, Ms. Chao is described in a department biography
as the youngest deputy secretary in the administration.
   She has represented the department in White House Cabinet
meetings, traveled to oil spill sites, given speeches around the
country and, in an emotional moment, visited a memorial honoring
the 270 victims of Pan Am Flight 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   When a United Airlines DC-10 went down in Sioux City, Iowa, last
month, killing 111 people, she went to the White House to monitor
news of the crash and brief Chief of Staff John Sununu as
developments unfolded.
   Sitting in her Transportation Department office on a soft couch
under a delicate Chinese painting handed down by her grandmother,
she cuts an image in sharp contrast with fast-moving, back-slapping
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, a former federal
prosecutor.
   She describes herself as well-organized and structured. Framed
signal flags on her wall express a major goal: ``smooth sailing.''
   ``I like to be prepared,'' Ms. Chao said. ``But I'm learning how
to handle things a little bit more spontaneously.''
   She praises Skinner as a ``man of vision and a man of great
courage'' at a time when the nation faces crises and challenges in
air, sea and land transportation. Skinner has been overseeing
cleanup of the Alaskan oil spill, helping to lead international
efforts against air terrorists, pushing for tighter mileage
standards for automobiles, and trying to put together a national
transportation policy.
   ``The secretary moves at 800 miles per hour, so his deputy has
to be able to pick up the ball and run with it,'' said Catherine
Bedell, Ms. Chao's press deputy.
   As deputy secretary, Ms. Chao is chief operating officer for an
agency that has 100,000 employees and a $28.4 billion annual
budget, with ``responsiblity for program and policy guidance over
surface, sea and air transportation.''
   Ms. Chao said that as a student, a banker for BankAmerica and
Citicorp and as a maritime commissioner and commission chairman,
she had always been able to read enough and learn enough to know
issues better than most people around her.
   Now, she said, the transportation department covers such a wide
range of issues that she has to depend more on her staff.
   Born on Taiwan of parents who fled mainland China, Ms. Chao said
that although she has had little involvement in Asian issues, she
remains proud of her Chinese heritage and grateful for the
sacrifices of her parents who took the risk of coming to America.
   She recalls learning English by copying strange words off the
blackboard and having her father painstakingly translate them for
her at home so she could learn her lessons.
   ``America has been the land of golden opportunity for our
family,'' she said at ceremonies where then-Vice President Bush
swore her in as maritime chairman. ``We came with our hopes, dreams
and aspirations, and America received us with open arms and with
her opportunities, her values and her decency.''
   Her parents, James and Ruth Chao, live in Harrison, N.Y., where
he is a businessman. They have four other daughters, including one
still in high school.
   ``I'm actually very comfortable with numbers,'' said Ms. Chao,
who has a master's degree in business administration from Harvard
Business School and a bachelor's degree in economics from Mount
Holyoke College. She also has studied at Dartmouth, Columbia and
the Masschusetts Institute of Technology.
   She first came to Washington six years ago as a White House
Fellow, working on President Reagan's policy staff.
   She campaigned for Bush, primarily among Asian-Americans in
California, and gave one of several seconding speeches for his
nomination at the Republican National Convention in New Orleans
last year.
   Ms. Chao said she has felt comfortable working for both Reagan
and Bush, although she considers the Reagan administration more
ideological and Bush's leadership more pragmatic.
   Her own approach: ``I want to get up in the morning and feel
challenged.''

<HEAD>Bug-Biting Trivia: From Barbed Mouthparts To Twitching Antennae</HEAD>

   The ways bugs bite, sting and pinch are as varied as the insects.
   Among the most common pestiferous bugs:
   _Mosquitoes. With its annoying itch, persistent whine and
syringe-like mouth, the mosquito is one of man's universal
scourges. More than 2,000 species thrive in the United States alone.
   Most mosquitoes live only a few weeks. The average female lays
more than 100 eggs, which can lie dormant for a year in some
species. Only the female requires a blood meal; males eat pollen
and nectar.
   The female inserts her mouth into the victim's skin and secretes
an anti-coagulant, ensuring a steady stream of blood. Bug experts
believe this anti-coagulant causes the itch.
   _Ticks. The tick is like a miniature tank and perhaps more
impregnable. With eight legs, no antennae or wings, few natural
predators, and remarkable abilities to multiply and survive long
periods without food, ticks are considered by entomologists to be
one of nature's most adaptable creatures.
   The common American dog tick, for example, produces 5,000 eggs
at a time. Each larva must find a ``host'' animal to feed upon.
Soviet scientists have kept members of one tick species alive for
14 years without food, said Robert Hall, professor of entomology at
the University of Missouri in Columbia.
   The tick mouth includes a central needle covered with barbs to
lock it in place like a fishhook. Once attached, the tick exudes a
glue-like liquid that also helps prevent dislodging. A tick
infected with disease-producing organisms can infect the host when
it feeds.
   Numerous tick species are found in the United States, most of
which live in woodsy surroundings, although they can be transported
by animals.
   _Flies. A plague recorded from Biblical times, flies fall into
two categories: those that thrive on garbage and waste, and those
that bite. Thousands of species abound.
   Flies that breed on filth don't bite or draw blood, although
they can spread disease if they land on an open wound.
   Male and female biting flies, such as the stable fly, feed on
blood. They have piercing mouthparts and feed like the mosquito.
   Most flies lay rapidly hatching eggs. In summer, a housefly will
hatch in 12 hours; it reaches adulthood in about 10 days.

   Imagine you're surrounded by hordes of
roaches, flies, mosquitoes, fleas, moths, beetles and a couple of
dozen hairy tarantulas, devising new ways to kill or repel them.
   It's a way of life for the scientists at the S.C. Johnson Wax
entomology laboratory, the biggest corporate research facility
devoted to the demise of biting and annoying pests. To these
anti-bug commandos, who helped develop such pioneering products as
Raid and OFF!, the battle never ends.
   ``People ask if insects are going to take over the world _ they
already have,'' says lab director Roger Grothaus, who has studied
bugs for more than 25 years.
   John Randall, a senior research scientist at the lab, said the
33 Johnson Wax entomologists have a healthy respect for the 30
species of bugs that live there, which form a population exceeding
3.5 million.
   ``These are high quality insects,'' Randall said. ``We think of
them as precision lab instruments. We know exactly how old each
cockroach is.''
   The lab consists of several buildings in a suburban neighborhood
near Racine, headquarters of Johnson Wax, a privately owned
consumer products company.
   Johnson Wax does not disclose its bug-study budget. But company
spokeswoman Cynthia Georgeson said it allocates more money for
research and development on urban entomology than all competitors
combined.
   Like the members of his staff, Grothaus is fascinated with bugs
and the ingenious ways they survive. On his desk sit metal
sculptures of a grasshopper and a scorpion, and he drinks from a
mug illustrated with insect drawings. The workers keep a tank of
hairy tarantulas as lab mascots.
   ``Working with entomology lets you stay like a kid,'' Grothaus
said. ``It's like being the 8-year-old kid who runs around with a
jar collecting bugs.''
   In an average week, approximately 100,000 houseflies and 150,000
mosquitoes are hatched for testing, as well as more than 50,000
cockroaches of the American and smaller German varieties.
   Lab rooms are specially designed for insect habitat, their
temperatures set at 80 degrees with 50 percent relative humidity.
   The flea testing area uses an apparatus that the researchers
call an ``artificial cat.'' They place fleas in tiny containers
with cat hair, and the fleas pierce a skin-like surface to feed on
blood.
   The researchers scrutinize the insects 365 days a year, and even
though the labs hold racks of containers with thousands of flying
bugs, company officials report few escapees.
   ``I get bit more on the outside than in here,'' Randall said.
   Tests range from freeing houseflies in chemical-filled cubicles,
to spraying a person's arms with repellent and sticking them into a
mosquito swarm. If a product successfully passes through several
experiments, it's tested in homes.
   Formulas for the insect sprays, however, must be changed
routinely, because the bugs are so good at adapting to different
environments, Grothaus said.
   Aside from studying ways to kill insects with chemicals, the
center is researching the behavior of insects and ways to modify it.
   ``Did you know you can condition a cockroach?'' Grothaus said.
``Now if you could just teach them to leave the house ...''
   One new product devised by Johnson Wax uses mild electrical
currents to disrupt the equilibrium of houseflies, which then
crash-land on a sticky surface. Grothaus said the company is
marketing the product as a safe way to keep kitchens fly-free.
   One of the toughest jobs, however, is finding ways to rout the
cockroach, an insect that arouses particular disgust for Grothaus.
   ``I truly don't like them,'' he said. ``I consider them filthy.''
   Grothaus said he thinks the typical household cockroach inspires
revulsion because it crawls in garbage and ``then it goes onto your
plates.''
   ``If you see a big, bad, ugly spider, you might be startled,''
he said. ``But then the next day you tell people, `I saw the
biggest spider.' But you don't go telling people, `Gee whiz, I have
a house full of cockroaches.'''
   Some of the rarer roaches, however, are treated more fondly at
the lab.
   The scientists keep a container of 4-inch Madagascar hissing
cockroaches, and Randall said they're viewed more as pets than
research tools.
   ``These are `oh my' roaches,'' he said. ``People say `oh my'
when they see them.''

<HEAD>Legacy of World War II Shapes Thinking to This Day</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphics, LaserPhotos</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Savagely attacking Poland a
half-century ago, Adolf Hitler's armies sparked a conflagration
that killed more than 50 million people and spread worldwide in
history's costliest war.
   World War II drew in every major power, leaving behind a bitter
legacy from fighting and Holocaust that shape the thinking of
nations to this day.
   The reverberations range from the tensions between the
capitalist West and communist East to lingering uneasiness over the
possibility of ever reunifying the two Germanys.
   And there are more individual problems, such as in Japan, with
the diplomatic difficulties that arose over the attendance of
foreign dignitaries at the funeral of Emperor Hirohito last
February, and in Austria, where President Kurt Waldheim's war
record as a German officer is under divisive scrutiny.
   The Holocaust _ the Nazis' extermination of an estimated 6
million Jews _ shocked the world like no other atrocity known to
mankind and still casts the longest shadow of the war.
   Last November, Philipp Jenninger had to resign as speaker of the
West German Parliament just 48 hours after making a clumsily worded
speech that sought to explain the German people's anti-Semitism and
fascination with Hitler.
   However good his intentions, Jenninger offended many Germans,
Jewish and non-Jewish.
   The war is remembered, too, in small, day-to-day details, like
the seats reserved for war invalids on French trains, or the
Christmas tree in London's Trafalgar Square, an annual gift from a
grateful Norwegian people for the British war effort.
   It was an arena for giants, good and bad: Hitler, Winston
Churchill, Josef Stalin, Franklin Roosevelt. And it produced
postwar leaders such as Charles de Gaulle, architect of modern
France, and Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who ruled Yugoslavia until his
death in 1980 and helped found the movement of non-aligned nations.
   Every nation shapes its own lessons from the war, often with
distortions or exaggerations.
   For the French, there is the painful knowledge that one's
parents or grandparents may have collaborated with their Nazi
conquerors.
   For Eastern Europe, decades of official hero-worship of the
Soviet forces are giving way to greater objectivity, in large part
as a result of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
openness.
   ``In the vision of the war we used to get, only the Russians
were brave in fighting the Germans,'' said Anna Radziwill, who has
taught high school history for 30 years and was elected to Poland's
newly created Senate.
   ``The vision of the West was that they were just sending us
canned food,'' said Ms. Radziwill, a member of one of Poland's old
noble families.
   German sailors aboard the old battleship Schleswig-Holstein
fired the first shots of World War II, shelling a small Polish
garrison at Westerplatte near the Free City of Danzig at 4:45 a.m.
on Sept. 1, 1939. The German army poured across the Polish frontier
while Hitler's warplanes pounded the country from overhead.
   Two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany. But
not until 1941 did the fighting become a true world war, with the
German invasion of the Soviet Union and the Japanese attack on the
U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor. In all, more than 50 nations joined the
fighting.
   Still uneasy neighbors 40 years after their creation, the two
Germanys present vastly different accounts of World War II and its
causes.
   In communist East Germany, a high school textbook from 1986
states: ``World War II was unleashed by German imperialists and
militarists,'' spurred by a desire for profits and conquests.
   But just over the border, teen-agers in West Germany's Hesse
state are taught that Nazism was an all-embracing affair, ``a
terrible aberration to which an entire people was able to be driven
by ideological blindness, ignorance and cowardice.''
   Revised history books for Soviet high school students still
insist Moscow's forces defeated Japan virtually single-handed, even
though the Kremlin did not declare war on Japan until three days
after a U.S. bomber dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima.
   The textbook for the 11th grade says that ``the use of the
atomic weapon was not militarily necessary.''
   ``By this crime, unprecedented in the history of mankind,
imperialist circles in the U.S.A. wanted to demonstrate its
then-strategic superiority before the whole world,'' the textbook
says.
   But Soviet students do learn that their country's agreement to
divide up Poland with the Germans was unjust.
   In Warsaw, a newly emboldened Communist government is moving
closer to blaming the Soviets for the massacre of more than 4,000
Polish officers in Katyn. To reverse the official line _ that the
Nazis did it _ would constitute a monumental act of historical
revisionism in East European minds.
   Momo Kapor, a best-selling Yugoslav author and satirist, summed
up the distortions of the past this way: ``During the past 40 years
or so, grandpas and grandmas, uncles and old aunts have been
correcting, secretly, official lessons from textbooks.
   ``From our earliest days, to finish school somehow, we had to
pretend that we believed in official stories, while in fact we
believed in things that were forbidden,'' Kapor said in a recent
column in the Belgrade daily newspaper Politika.
   While Britain remains unabashedly proud of its wartime role,
other Western European nations, such as France and Italy, have had
to face up to the darker side of their war record.
   France was easily defeated in 1940 and was then divided into an
occupied zone and a French puppet regime headquartered in the town
of Vichy. The Germans later occupied the whole country.
   Historian Henri Rousso said in an interview that many fellow
Frenchmen have long thought their country was made up mostly of
brave resistance fighters who ultimately helped the Allied victory.
He said textbooks began to tell a different story in the early
1970s.
   French Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld said many French people do
not know that the country ``actively collaborated with the Germans.
And thanks to de Gaulle's diplomatic genius, many French people
think that France really won the war.''
   ``The period was like a civil war, with two opposite camps: de
Gaulle and the resistance on one side, and the Vichy
collaborationist regime on the other,'' Klarsfeld said in an
interview.
   Alessia Jannece, a high school student in Rome, said: ``They
really don't teach us much about fascism. I learn mostly from TV or
what I remember from middle school.''
   The lessons are important for a country haunted by its past
under fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. Professor Renzo De
Felice's highly respected 1982 biography of Mussolini contends
there was general consensus for fascism in Italy.
   Last year's 50th anniversary of Austria's annexation by Nazi
Germany and a select commission's finding that Waldheim was in
``close proximity'' to Nazi war crimes also prompted soul-searching.
   ``Although the Second World War is now far distant, its shadows
are long, its echoes loud,'' British historian Martin Gilbert says
in a new history of the war. ``How else could it be with an event,
lasting for nearly six years, in which courage and cruelty, hope
and horror, violence and virtue, massacre and survival, were so
closely intertwined?''

<HEAD>Scars Still Visible on the Rubble-to-Riches Miracle</HEAD>

   At times, Adolf Hitler's legacy is
painfully visible across the landscape of Western Europe.
   Other times you must look twice and you will still not see it,
so far-reaching has been Western Europe's transformation from
rubble to riches.
   In West Berlin the black, stunted steeple of the Kaiser Wilhelm
Gedaechtniskirche has been deliberately left unrepaired as a
reminder of the war, while the rest of the city is full of posh
shopping centers and traffic-choked streets.
   Young skiers and model airplane enthusiasts atop the Teufelsberg
could easily forget that the 360-foot hill is a pile of
grassed-over bomb rubble.
   London's East End, heavily bombed in the war, is now the site of
Europe's largest urban redevelopment project, although work is
occasionally delayed when an unexploded German bomb is discovered.
   The Dutch, Belgian and French coast lines are dotted with
fortifications the Nazis built against an attack from the West. But
many others were removed to make room for seashore apartments,
hotels and amusement parks.
   Near the southern Dutch town of Den Bosch, a former
concentration camp has been transformed into a housing project.
   Europeans older than 50 can still remember digging makeshift
homes out of the rubble, eating dogs and cats, begging GIs for
chocolate bars.
   Whole towns were flattened. London alone endured 57 consecutive
nights of bombing during the Blitz in which 15,000 people died.
   Today, the 320 million West Europeans enjoy a standard of living
surpassed in the West only by the United States.
   The economic jumpstart for the post-war miracle was U.S. aid
through the Marshall Plan and other programs, which by 1952 had
poured $45 billion into Europe.
   It was followed, in 1957, by the creation of the European
Economic Community.
   Now comprising 12 countries _ Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium,
Luxembourg and Denmark _ the EEC accounts for 20 percent of world
trade, compared with 13 percent for the United States and 12
percent for Japan.
   More important than statistics, however, is the fact that by
interweaving their economies, the Western Europeans have made war
among themselves unthinkable.
   The road to European integration is littered with disputes about
everything from farm prices to the color of the European passport.
But the success story is still being written.
   The EEC's internal borders are scheduled to come down by 1992,
creating a single, tariff-free trading bloc. This is to be followed
by monetary union, including a central bank and, eventually, a
single European currency.

<TEXT>
   The opening shots of what would become the world's most
devastating war wasn't enough to displace the classified ads that
filled the front page of The Times of London in those days.
   ``AT WAR WITH GERMANY,'' the headline proclaimed, spread over
two columns _ on page 8.
   Two days earlier, readers of Moscow's Izvestia had to turn to
page 4 to find a terse piece on the German invasion of Poland, on
Sept. 1, 1939, the start of a war that eventually would claim at
least 14 million Soviet lives. The headline: ``MILITARY ACTION
BETWEEN POLAND AND GERMANY.''
   On the same day, the Nazi party newspaper, Voelkischer
Beobachter, hardly made plain what was behind the German invasion.
   ``THE FUEHRER ANNOUNCES THE STRUGGLE FOR THE RIGHTS AND SECURITY
OF THE REICH,'' said the red-ink banner headline. ``Counterattack
has started,'' added a smaller subtitle, reflecting German
propaganda claims of Polish border violations.
   Some commentators on both sides thought the conflict could be
contained.
   Said a wishful editorial in the Koelnische Zeitung of Cologne:
``The voluntary confinement of our strategy ... and the respect of
Belgian, Dutch, Luxembourg and Swiss neutrality by Germany could
make it easy for London and Paris to let the German-Polish conflict
pass as a local dispute.''
   In Paris, Le Temps commented: ``We are certain that the
government will do everything to avoid a catastrophe, if this is
possible. The entire country stands behind it to fight ... for the
freedom of the peoples and its own independence but it is ready,
too, to listen to all voices that may still be raised in favor of
appeasement.''
   But The New York Times warned against further yielding to the
Nazis:
   ``The German government has used its strategic position in the
center of Europe to blackmail the small countries on its borders.
It has used every sign of hesitation on the part of its larger
neighbors, every offer of mediation on their part, and every
gesture of good will as a wedge for ever greater demands and
threats and seizure.''
   The Times of London had led the British press in calling for the
appeasement in the 1930s. But now it had no doubts:
   ``Britain and France will not cease from war until the defeat of
Hitler and their duty to themselves and the civilization have been
fully and finally accomplished. They have entered upon the war
without illusions. No setbacks, no sacrifices will turn them from
that end.''

<HEAD>Wildlife Managers Scratch Heads In Search For Sea Lion Solution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Everybody has a solution for getting rid of
fish-munching sea lions at Seattle's Ballard ship locks. So far,
everybody's been wrong.
   A biological consultant wants to put the bewhiskered mammals on
a diet by putting the fish out of reach. Greenpeace says feed them
more fish. Other folks have suggested killer whales, polar bears
and even alligators to scare them.
   State officials say they've tried everything feasible and are at
wit's end after four years of firecrackers, painful underwater
noises, barrier nets and transporting the animals all the way to
the Pacific Ocean coast _ only to see them swim hundreds of miles
back to their easy Seattle supper.
   Those four years' effort cost more than $200,000, and officials
have spent more than $70,000 this year, said Joe Scordino of the
National Marine Fisheries Service. ``They're smart animals. They
adapt very quickly and they're very keen and sensitive to
everything in their environment.''
   Now frustrated wildlife managers are seeking permission to kill
the animals before they eliminate a valuable run of steelhead trout.
   The sea lions may be pushing a ``unique strain'' to extinction
and must be stopped for steelhead populations to return to normal
in the Lake Washington watershed, said Bob Byrne of the state
Department of Wildlife.
   Steelhead are migratory fish, born in streams and spending the
first two years of their lives in fresh water before swimming out
to sea. They live in the ocean for two years, then return to their
birth streams to spawn. The sea lions _ 39 different animals have
been trapped so far _ wait for returning fish in the narrow locks
that connect Puget Sound with Lake Washington.
   The Wildlife Department has asked federal permission to to kill
the sea lions, and Scordino said it may be allowed to do so under a
public ``health, safety and welfare'' clause in the Marine Mammal
Protection Act.
   If given the OK, the state would kill the sea lions ``if no
other option were available to protect that run'' of steelhead,
Byrne said. About half the 250 people attending a public hearing in
June favored killing them, he said.
   An answer is expected from the Marine Fisheries Service this
month.
   Greenpeace spokesman Ben Deeble warned that the environmental
group would do ``whatever it takes'' to prevent the killing of sea
lions.
   The Ballard Locks steelhead aren't worth saving since they have
mingled with fish released from hatcheries and are no longer truly
wild, he said. ``If they want more steelhead to get past the sea
lions at the Ballard Locks, they can do it by putting more
steelhead in the system.''
   Jim Neilsen, head of the state migratory fish program, said the
steelhead ``have retained a separate identity in spawning time. If
they're not identical to the native fish they're certainly
successors to them.''
   Wild fish are important because as indicators of environmental
quality, Byrne said. ``Because they exist and can actually thrive
in the watershed, we see we are doing a pretty good job of managing
that environment.''
   Biologist Steve Shanewise of Olympia said killing sea lions
wouldn't solve anything; others will continue to find the locks,
requiring more killing.
   ``The problem is an artificial habitat, where the fish are
confined in a narrow place,'' said Shanewise, president of Coot
Co., a consulting firm. Fish in the wild can hide beneath logs and
other obstructions, he said, but those in the locks ``have to run a
straight shot through the gauntlet of sea lions.''
   At the June hearing, Shanewise and colleague Bill Way presented
a plan to build an artificial cover for the fish, including an
internal wall of ``prison bars'' parallel to the channel walls at
the locks. The bars would run from the surface to the bottom,
spaced far enough apart for fish but not sea lions.
   The plan ``was a real good idea, but it's going to be
expensive,'' Byrne said. It will go into an environmental
assessment, along with others received before Aug. 15, which is to
be reviewed before a decision is made.

<HEAD>Scientists Report Progress In Creating Immune Farm Animals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers who created gene-engineered cells
immune to a class of viruses that causes foot-and-mouth disease and
diarrhea say it could lead to farm animals that are hereditarily
immune to such diseases.
   Researchers Yehudit Chebat and Michel Revel of the Weizmann
Institute of Science reported that they have created a gene that
immunizes cells, and that they have produced a line of
virus-resistant hamster cells.
   Cells were rendered immune by introducing an altered gene, which
triggered the production of anti-viral enzymes, Revel said. ``The
next step is immunizing a whole animal'' through a genetic
engineering process known as transgenics.
   That entails removing a newly fertilized egg from an animal,
inserting the altered gene and reinserting the treated egg into a
foster-mother. The newborn animal would be expected to have the
immunizing gene throughout its body.
   It will then posses a genetically inspired resistance to a class
of viruses called picornaviruses, which cause diseases such as
polio and the common cold in humans. The animal would pass on this
immunity to its offspring.
   Commercial production of virus-resistant animals, which may
prove ethically controversial, is years away.
   ``his type of genetic engineering is also theoretically possible
with humans,'' Revel said. ``But it would be ethically
inconceivable to attempt such an experiment.''
   Until now, the only genes that produced anti-viral enzymes were
those treated with interferon, a protein known for its
virus-fighting abilities. The newly created gene operates without
prompting from interferon.
   The altered gene, known as the 258-synthesis, is also unique in
that it does not adversely affect the normal activities of the
cell, a hurdle that had previously proved insurmountable, the
researchers said.
   Revel predicted that with adequate funding the research team
would be able to produce a fully resistant farm animal in two to
five years.
   Similar research involving a different virus of the influenza
family is being conducted at the University of Munich's Center for
Molecular Biology. The 2-year-old project uses similar techniques
to genetically modify mice.
   That experiment has proved inconclusive because the hoped-for
resistance has not been strong enough, said Ernst Winnacker, the
Munich center's director. In addition, creating genetically altered
animals has aroused considerable controversy in West Germany,
Winnacker said. ``We have a series of self-imposed guidelines on
genetic research. The West German Cabinet recently recommended that
these guidelines be made into law.''
   The limitations, unlikely to take effect for two years, would
not affect research under way, he said, adding he has no doubt
``commercially producing genetically altered farm animals will be
extremely controversial.''
   Amos Shapira, an expert on bio-medical ethics at Israel's Tel
Aviv University, said stringent precautions should be observed by
the scientists in cases where altering genes are involved. He
advocated limiting altered animals to the laboratory for several
generations to study potential side effects.
   Revel said the genes used in his experiment are taken from a
human.

<HEAD>East Coast To Get Good View of Aug. 16 Lunar Elipse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After missing out on the last 14 lunar
eclipses, North America on Aug. 16 will get its first glimpse in
seven years of the Earth's shadow slowly advancing across the face
of the moon.
   Recent lunar eclipses have been visible only from the Eastern
Hemisphere because that was the side of Earth facing the moon, or
they have begun before moonrise or ended after the moon set,
astronomers say.
   ``For the past seven years, we've been in the wrong place for
all 14 lunar eclipses,'' said University of Florida astronomer
Billy Cooke. This time, ``we happen to lie smack dab where you want
to be to see the whole darn thing, and it will be a spectacular
sight.''
   The East Coast will have the best view of the eclipse, which is
expected to turn the moon orange or blood-red at its peak. Viewers
on the West Coast will be able to see only the tail end of the
eclipse.
   The full moon will darken slightly beginning at 8:23 p.m., and
will be its most brilliant from 10:20 to 11:56 p.m. ``Skywatchers
will be able to see the earth's shadow taking bites out of the
moon,'' Cooke said, ``But instead of being black where the bite is
the moon will glow orange or red.''
   Earth's atmosphere bends light onto the surface of the moon,
causing the orange-red color, he said.
   Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses can be watched with the
naked eye, as well as through binoculars or telescopes.

<HEAD>Study Links Teen Sunburn, Later Melanoma Skin Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Girls who get bad sunburns as teen-agers double
their risk of dangerous melanoma skin cancer later in life, a new
study shows.
   ``Sunbathing should be recognized as a potentially hazardous
behavior,'' conclude Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers. The
findings add to growing evidence that sunburn during childhood and
adolescence is especially dangerous.
   The study found that teens who got five or more blistering
sunburns between ages 15 and 20 had twice the risk of melanoma as
those who avoided bad burns.
   It turned up no evidence of a link between blistering sunburns
after age 30 and skin cancer, but researchers cautioned that this
doesn't mean unlimited sunbathing is safe for older people.
   The analysis, directed by Dr. Martin A. Weinstock, was based on
130 women with melanoma who participated in Harvard Medical
School's long-running Nurses' Health Study.
   The doctors recommended that people try to stay out of direct
sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when the sun is strongest, and
cover up with clothing and sunscreen. They noted that the incidence
of melanoma is increasing rapidly and is likely to exceed colon
cancer among people born after 1950.

   Monte Briner was trapped in a silent world where
he couldn't sing, write letters or talk to his children. He now can
``talk'' to the world with a computer system developed to help Lou
Gehrig's disease victims.
   ``It was a godsend to us,'' said his wife, Debbie. ``A month
after we got the computer, Monte lost his voice completely.''
   Briner, 47, has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which destroys
nerve cells controlling almost every muscle within two to five
years while leaving a person's mental capacity intact. There is no
known cure.
   Using Communi-Mate, Briner's eyebrow muscles send commands from
a sweatband he wears 24 hours a day to the computer, which has a
menu of over 2,000 words.
   With it, he can write letters or talk to his daughters,
Elizabeth, 5, and Emily, 9. More importantly, he can signal nurses
in times of crisis.
   ``It gives off an ear-piercing house alarm. He's set it off
several times during the night. One particular time, it saved his
life,'' when it alerted people that a breathing tube was
disconnected, Mrs. Briner said.
   The former hospital executive, an excellent athlete, was
diagnosed in 1984 and given no more than four years to live. As his
condition deteriorated, his wife began to look around for some way
to communicate with her husband.
   She settled on the 4-year-old system designed by Steve Wells and
Tim Ryan. It uses an Apple-compatible computer, printer, monitor,
voice synthesizer and switches to control up to 250 household
appliances. It can be used by anyone who can move ``one-sixteenth
of an inch anywhere on the body,'' Wells said.
   Briner has developed a menu system of commonly used phrases and
questions, a medical menu and a sports and trivia file.
   ``This is a breakthrough for patients who have no hope,'' said
Wendy Fisher, executive director of the Les Turner ALS Foundation,
which rents it for $25 a month. Sixteen other people are using the
system, which costs $2,500.
   ``People who had not been able to communicate were now all of a
sudden able to let their thoughts out,'' she said. ``They were
prisoners in their bodies.''

   Whenever Christopher Marten posed for a
picture, his parents would say, ``Close your mouth. Stick your
tongue in.''
   For Christopher, Down's syndrome made that a struggle.
   The genetic disorder meant saliva would trickle from his mouth,
his teeth were unevenly spaced, and a large, protruding tongue
threatened to dislodge his front teeth. A dentist and orthodontist
suggested Tad and Karen Marten allow corrective plastic surgery to
reduce the size of his tongue.
   While plastic surgeons admit they can't cure Down's syndrome,
they say a procedure known as craniofacial reconstruction may
increase their patients' self-esteem by giving them more ``normal''
facial features.
   ``We are trying to simply change those characteristics that make
the children look like they have Down,'' said Dr. Kenneth Salyer of
Dallas. But he urges parents not to expect a change in their
child's intelligence.
   Therein lies a controversy. Some doctors and parents believe
that when surgery is done on Down individuals for mainly cosmetic
reasons, society will expect too much from mentally retarded
children made to look ``normal.''
   Most plastic surgeons who treat Down children believe improving
their appearances lessens prejudice toward the one in 800 people
born with it. They also say it helps raise society's low
expectations of Down children and helps ease them into the social
and educational mainstream.
   Such surgery for Down children began in the mid-1970s in Europe.
``So we're really just beginning to see studies about the effect.
Not only the functional improvement for the children, but, more
importantly, their psychological and intellectual capabilities when
they're older,'' said plastic surgeon Michael Stalnecker at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City.
   The National Down Syndrome Congress doesn't advocate the surgery
``but does encourage thoughtful investigation to find the most
appropriate team to assist you in the investigation,'' said Diane
Crutcher, executive director.
   ``That team would ideally include not only the plastic surgeon
... but also a psychologist and speech therapist.''
   Certain characteristics make Down children easily recognizable.
Their intellectual abilities are stunted. They develop slanted
eyes, flattened nose bridges, protruding tongues, small, sometimes
rotated ears disproportionately low on their heads, generally
chubby appearances and short, broad fingers.
   As recently as the 1970s, they were institutionalized by doctors
who felt nothing could be done and parents who couldn't cope with
the idea of a less-than-perfect child. But the '80s have brought
research showing early intervention helps Down children thrive
outside institutions.
   Down's hasn't kept Christopher, 20, from being a boy scout,
swimmer, bowler, drummer, church acolyte and usher or member of the
Chappaqua Drama Group and Volunteer Fire Department. He has also
collected a Special Olympics Athlete of the Year award and holds a
part-time job at a fast-food restaurant.
   Christopher enjoys the lifestyle of most any normal young man,
though he can't read or realize when he doesn't have enough money
for something.
   ``We've always encouraged him to do what's possible,'' says Tad.
``He is very self-confident and has a good self-image. He thinks
he's hot stuff.''
   Christopher's surgery was done in September 1984 at New York
University Medical Center, one of the leading centers for
craniofacial reconstruction, by Dr. Joseph McCarthy, a prominent
plastic surgeon.
   ``We had no guarantees of the outcome but we knew that the
tongue would be so swollen, it would be difficult for him to eat,''
Karen says, adding that Christopher was drinking milkshakes by the
time he returned home.
   A 1986 Israeli study found that reducing the size of the tongue
improved speech, made eating easier and eliminated drooling, said
Stalnecker, adding he believes that many parents seek to eliminate
traits others find troubling.
   In Christopher's case, however, it was ``strictly to save his
teeth,'' Karen says. There's ``no dramatic change'' in his speech,
but people who have known him say they understand him better on the
telephone.
   Salyer, head of the International Craniofacial Institute in
Dallas, has treated more than three dozen children and says there
is no evidence supporting parents' belief they can understand their
children better after the surgery.
   ``It depends on what was done and how your particular child
heals,'' says a guidebook for parents published by The Foundation
for Craniofacial Deformities.
   Only a relatively small percentage of Down individuals make
acceptable candidates for the surgery, said Dr. Garry Brody,
associate clinical professor of surgery at the University of
Southern California.
   It ``should only be performed on children whose social
interaction can be improved by the procedures,'' he noted in the
Israeli study, ``Rehabilitation of the Face in Patients with Down's
Syndrome.''
   ``Some Down's children have a relatively high IQ and function
relatively well in society,'' he said. ``These children are truly
handicapped by the stigma of their appearance and do benefit from
the surgery.''
   The cost can vary depending on where the surgery is done and the
doctor doing it. There is debate over whether parents should bear
the cost or health insurers, who now make the decision on a
case-by-case basis.
   ``If we're doing it to correct a functional defect, then it
should be covered; if it's for strictly cosmetic reasons ... it may
not be covered,'' said attorney Austin Rinella, of the New York
Insurance Department.
   ``If we start paying claims that are purely elective, not
medically necessary, premiums will skyrocket,'' said Rinella.
Elective surgery ``will adversely affect everybody in the insurance
pool.''
   Frances Cooke MacGregor, an anthropologist and authority on the
psychological effects of deformity, believes even if there are few
functional improvements to be gained, the other benefits are
plentiful.
   ``They become more socially acceptable and if they have
siblings, the siblings feel better too.'' Siblings ``don't feel
that this is rubbing off on them. They don't feel maybe ashamed or
afraid or guilty or unhappy.''
   The best time to have the surgery done, Stalnecker said, is
about age 5 when ``children are just becoming aware of their
differences in appearance ... before classmates begin to ridicule
the child about his appearance and before the child begins to
develop any type of complex about it.''
   It is difficult, he acknowledged, for parents to make a decision
on whether to permit surgery before children are able to express
their own feelings.
   And parents might reject surgery if they know their child will
be limited intellectually, he said. ``They feel that if the child
is made to look normal, he won't have any excuse for any behavior
that isn't considered normal.''
   If a child has traits typically associated with Down's, ``then
everyone says, `Oh well, I can understand that _ he doesn't have
his full intellectual capabilities.' But if he looks normal, they
say, `What's wrong with that person?' and the behavior is not
accepted.''

in court.
   The claims concern oil the companies purchased from Saudi Arabia
a decade ago at prices below those set by the OPEC oil cartel, and
in turn sold to refiners at those lower prices.
   Texaco's claims could total nearly $1.8 billion, including $863
million in back taxes and $925 million in interest, while Exxon
said Wednesday it was being billed $269 million in back taxes but
declined to give an interest figure.
   ``They're trying to get us to pay for something we never earned
and which the American public benefited from,'' said Exxon
spokesman Bill Smith. ``We sold oil at lower prices. The American
public got the benefit of those lower prices.''
   Texaco, based in White Plains, N.Y., said the company
``vigorously disputes the IRS's interpretations of the law and will
contest the agency's position.''
   The IRS had notified Texaco about possible claims stemming from
the earlier oil transaction with the Saudis during an audit last
year in connection with Texaco's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization.
   The claims are based on an IRS theory concerning the handling of
crude oil purchased from Saudi Arabia during 1979-1981, when the
official price set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries was $34 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest exporter, was selling its crude for
$28 a barrel to Texaco, Exxon, Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp., its
four partners in the Arabian American Oil Co.
   One provision of the arrangement was that if any of the
companies resold the oil, they could not resell it at a profit.
   Texaco said the IRS apparently believed that when it resold the
crude to its foreign affiliates, it should have charged the $34
rate despite the restrictions by Saudia Arabia _ and paid taxes on
the difference.
   Because it did not, Texaco said it is being held liable for
taxes on the profits that its foreign affiliates made by being able
to sell refined products made from the cheaper Saudi oil.
   ``The IRS is saying `you have used too low a price in
calculating your profit. ``You've calculated according to a ($28)
oil price but really it should be ($34).' That's all the IRS is
saying,'' said Paul Ting, analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   IRS officials have declined to comment on the matter, saying
federal law prohibits the agency from commenting on the affairs of
any taxpayer.
   Analysts said it was not unusual for the IRS to contend that a
multinational company had wrongly booked to its foreign affiliates
revenue that actually should be attributed to the parent, and
therefore taxed in the United States.
   ``Texaco maintains that the IRS's position is wrong and that it
cannot tax the company for revenues it never received when it
resold the Arabian crude oil and which, under mandate of the Saudi
Arabian government, it could not receive,'' the company said in a
statement.
   Texaco began setting aside reserves to cover its possible
liability last year when the IRS notified the company that it could
owe back taxes.
   Exxon also was notified of possible tax claims but said at the
time that it would not set aside any money because it believed the
new IRS theory was flawed and that if the IRS did lodge a claim it
would be dismissed by the tax court.
   Both companies said current reserves were adequate to cover any
tax liabilities stemming from the claims.
   Exxon said Wednesday it filed a petition in U.S. Tax Court late
last month challenging the IRS claim after being notified June 29
that it owed the taxes. Texaco said it planned to file a formal
challenge within 90 days.

<HEAD>Mexico Announces Tax Breaks to Attract Capital, Low-Priced Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mexican government has announced tax
breaks to lure back money that investors took abroad to escape
Mexico's financial crisis and made a deal with auto manufacturers
to offer low-priced compact cars.
   A recent agreement on reducing the $107 billion foreign debt
``has generated confidence in Mexico and desire among many
investors to repatriate their capital,'' the Treasury Department
said Wednesday in a statement.
   The measures apply to capital returned to the country after Jan.
1, 1989.
   Officials hope the debt reduction agreement signed with foreign
creditor banks last month will ease economic uncertainty and
stimulate the private investment needed to revive Mexico's stagnant
economy.
   The agreement gives the more than 500 creditor banks the options
of writing off 35 percent of Mexican debt, lowering interest rates
to 6.25 percent or granting Mexico new loans. It covers $53 billion
of the debt, which is the second-highest in the developing world
after Brazil.
   Under the Treasury Department decree, deposits abroad over the
past three years earned no taxable income.
   It establishes a 3.7 percent tax on deposits or investments made
abroad in 1985 and a 5 percent tax for those made before 1985. The
maximum income tax for private indivduals is 40 percent.
   A second decree Wednesday provides tax exemptions for low-priced
compact cars and imported component parts used to make them. It
applies to cars that sell for no more than $5,500 and use low-lead
gasoline.
   ``The high prices of vehicles are outside the reach of most
national consumers,'' the decree said.
   Volkswagen, whose popular ``beetle'' is the lowest-priced
Mexican-made car, immediately took advantage of the new regulation,
setting its new price at $20 less than the $5,500 limit and $1,377
below its previous price.
   Morgan Guaranty Trust, one of Mexico's main creditor banks,
estimates that $84 billion in capital left the country between 1977
and 1987, but a private economist estimated the figure at about $50
billion.
   Capital flight began when, after years of stability, the peso
currency was devalued against the U.S. dollar in late 1976.
   In 1982, over-borrowing abroad and falling oil prices quickly
deflated the country's oil boom. Mexico could no longer keep up
with its foreign debt payments and the currency began a slide.
   In late 1982, about 70 pesos were equal to one U.S. dollar but
that rate is 2,500 to one today.

<HEAD>Avon's Board to Review Jacobs' Takeover Proposal, Plot Defenses</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The board of Avon Products Inc. plans to discuss
an unwanted $41-a-share, $2.85 billion takeover proposal from
investor Irwin L. Jacobs, who has indicated he's prepared to
persevere to gain control of the cosmetics maker.
   As the board holds a regular meeting today at Avon's
headquarters here, members are expected to renew their resolve to
keep the company on its current course.
   Jacobs' bid represents the third unsolicited offer for Avon this
year.
   James E. Preston, Avon's chairman and chief executive, issued a
brief news release Wednesday in which he revealed Jacobs' request
for a meeting to negotiate a possible purchase of Avon, the world's
biggest direct sales company.
   Preston said the request would be reviewed at the board's
meeting and that he had sent a letter to Jacobs informing him that
in the past, board members stressed that Avon is not for sale.
   Jacobs, who oversees his investment empire from Minneapolis,
said in a telephone interview Wednesday that he's never been in a
better position to carry out an acquisition attempt and indicated
he would be tenacious in his quest for Avon.
   ``We've had the best year we've ever had,'' Jacobs said. ``All
these things play a part. I have never been more serious about a
commitment in my life.''
   In three separate deals in the past year, Jacobs and investment
partners reported making more than $164 million.
   Jacobs' offer for Avon is worth about $2.25 billion based on
54.91 million shares of common stock outstanding. Jacobs also said
in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he
contemplates redeeming Avon's preferred shares, which would cost
$33.50 per share, or a total of about $603 million, raising the
price tag on Avon to roughly $2.85 billion.
   In composite New York Stock Exchange trading Wednesday, Avon
stock jumped $1 to $36.50 a share on word of Jacobs' proposal.
   But investors may have refrained from bidding Avon sharply
higher due to past disappointments. The company has slammed the
door on at least two suitors in recent months.
   In May, the Avon board rejected a hostile $39-a-share bid from
rival direct selling company Amway Corp. and indicated that it
would resist future acquisition attempts.
   Only days later, Mary Kay Corp., parent of door-to-door makeup
seller Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., disclosed its interest in acquiring
Avon but also got a cold shoulder.
   Although Amway withdrew its bid of about $2.1 billion, the
company still has a stake in Avon.
   Through a partnership with Jacobs, Amway has an interest in
about 10.3 percent of Avon's common stock outstanding. Jacobs
controls about 55 percent of the Avon stock owned by A-J
Partnership, as the alliance of Amway and Jacobs is called.
   The partnership didn't act jointly in making the initial bid for
Avon and Jacobs said they are not acting together now.
   If he prevails in his takeover attempt, Jacobs said, he would
keep Avon's core direct-selling business in the United States and
retain a significant interest in the company's international
division.
   There are about 475,000 Avon sales representatives operating in
the United States and 1 million selling Avon cosmetics, toiletries
and jewelry in foreign markets.
   Jacobs said if he gets control of Avon he would sell Avon's
retail division, which consists of some of the country's
best-selling perfumes sold at department store counters, including
Giorgio Beverly Hills and Red.
   He also would finish divesting the health care businesses that
Avon has been selling.
   The divestitures have been part of Avon's strategy to enhance
profitability. In the second quarter, Avon earned $39.5 million on
sales of $778 million compared with a loss of $82.5 million and
sales of $704 million a year earlier.
   Jacobs said he had no intention of selling any piece of Avon to
Amway or to Mary Kay. He said he has not had any contact with Avon
executives except a telephone call to acknowledge receipt of his
letter.
   Jacobs said he has hired an investment banking arm of Citicorp
to help him arrange financing for the all-cash offer for Avon.

<HEAD>Defendants Ordered to Forfeit $3.8 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The six defendants convicted of racketeering in
the landmark Princeton-Newport securities fraud case must forfeit a
total of $3.8 million, significantly less than what the government
wanted, a jury ruled.
   Federal prosecutors had asked that the defendants relinquish
salaries and other interests of more than $21 million.
   The largest forfeiture amount decided Wednesday, $3 million, was
against James Sutton Regan, a former partner in Princeton-Newport
Partners LP, a defunct securities house.
   His partnership interest was placed at $13.3 million and his
salary at $1.75 million.
   Four other defendants were each ordered to forfeit $200,000.
They are former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. trader Bruce Lee
Newberg, and former Princeton-Newport partners Charles M. Zarzecki,
Jack Z. Rabinowitz and Paul A. Berkman.
   The sixth defendant, former Princeton-Newport controller Steven
B. Smotrich, must forfeit $1,245.85, the jury ruled.
   ``We thought that what the government asked for was
exorbitant,'' said juror Michelle Rodriguez.
   Another juror, Judith T. Larabee, said she was not comfortable
having to decide the forfeiture question.
   ``It is just very difficult for a lay person, no matter what
their education and background, to assess something like forfeiture
when you are dealing with such large sums of money,'' she told The
New York Times.
   Defense attorneys, who have said they will appeal the
conviction, argued that the forfeiture the government sought was
excessive and violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual
punishment.
   After the forfeiture verdict, Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark
Hansen said he planned to file a motion that said the defendants
were liable under the racketeering statute to forfeit all the
partnership interests and salary that the government sought.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Carter indicated that he agreed.
   ``I'm definitely going to rule that way if the government makes
a motion,'' Carter said. ``In my view, the partnership interest is
totally forfeitable.''
   The judge then softened his remarks by saying he would review
the matter when both sides submitted written arguments.
   On Monday, the jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
convicted the defendants after a five-week trial of racketeering,
racketeering conspiracy, conspiracy and numerous counts of mail and
wire fraud.
   The jurors returned to court to consider forfeiture because the
federal anti-racketeering law allows it.
   The case marked the first time securities professionals were
accused of racketeering under the controversial law aimed at
combating mobsters and drug pushers. The Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations law provides heavy fines and lengthy prison
terms.
   The trial received widespread attention because it grew
indirectly out of the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal that
rocked Wall Street three years ago.
   ``We're pleased with the verdict because we hope it sends a
strong message to the securities industry that the Justice
Department is committed to a course of vigorous enforcement,'' said
U.S. Attorney Benito Romano.
   When asked about criticism of use of the racketeering statute in
this case, Romano said, ``We will use the RICO statute where
appropriate. We never viewed the RICO statute as being on trial in
this case.''
   The government had sought $2.5 million from Newberg and the
following forfeiture from the other defendants: Zarzecki, $1.1
million partnership interest and $267,483 in salary; Rabinowitz,
$791,191 partnership interest and $454,507 in salary; Berkman,
$762,613 partnership interest and $558,328 in salary; and Smotrich,
$124,583 in salary.
   The case involved a series of prearranged stock transactions
between 1984 and 1986. The government alleged that the defendants
illegally bought and sold stocks to generate phony tax losses.
   The case overlapped the government's 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment of former Drexel junk-bond chief Michael
Milken. Much of the same evidence is expected to be introduced at
Milken's trial, scheduled to begin in March 1990.
   Princeton-Newport, based in Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach,
Calif., went out of business after the indictment was brought last
August. Defense lawyers said at the time that the charges alone,
though unproven, destroyed the firm's ability to do business.
   Besides forfeiture, the defendants face up to 20 years in prison
on each of the two racketeering counts, three to five years for the
other charges, and fines. Carter scheduled sentencing for Oct. 16.

<HEAD>Coca-Cola Plans New Hispanic Ad Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coca-Cola Co. plans to salute Hispanic
contributions to American culture with a new advertising campaign
featuring such prominent Hispanic-Americans as actress Rita Moreno.
   The campaign, which will be coordinated with local bottlers in
five markets with large Hispanic populations, is being tied to the
1992 quincentenary celebration of Columbus' landing in America,
officials said Wednesday.
   The campaign is the latest example of the increasing importance
major advertisers are placing on reaching the fast-growing
population group.
   Coca-Cola officials declined to say how much they planned to
spend on the three-year effort but said it would be in the millions
of dollars.
   According to government figures, there are about 19 million
Hispanics in the United States, with buying power exceeding $130
billion a year.
   Hispanic Business magazine has estimated that the 50 leading
Hispanic market advertisers spent $550.1 million to reach Hispanics
in 1988, up 12 percent from $490.7 million in 1987.
   Top-ranked was Procter &amp; Gamble Co., at $20.8 million.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola and its arch-rival, Pepsico Inc. of
Purchase, N.Y., have also ranked among the heaviest spenders aiming
at Hispanics.
   Coca-Cola ranked 25th on the magazine's list with spending of
$1.6 million aimed at the Hispanic market in 1988.
   Pepsico, which also has snack food and restaurant operations,
ranked 15th with $2.9 million in spending, Hispanic Business said.
   Pepsi spokesman Jeff Brown said the company is currently running
commercials featuring the Latin pop rock performer Chayanne on
Spanish-language television. He declined to say how much Pepsi is
spending to reach Hispanics, however.
   The first ads in the Coca-Cola's ``Discovery '92: Heritage and
Future'' campaign were to run this week in the New York market,
where Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of New York planned to place them
first on Spanish-language TV stations.
   English-language versions also are planned, as well as ads in
both Spanish and English for the radio, print and outdoor media,
officials said.
   The New York ads feature one of five prominent Hispanics from
the area who recount their difficulties and persistence in
achieving success in fields such as classical music, ballet, social
services and state government.
   In one ad, film scholar Richard Pena recalls how his
grandparents took him to Spanish-language movies when he was young.
He said he remains grateful for their guidance and thinks of them
whenever he selects films in his role as head of the program
committee for the New York Film Festival.
   At the end of each commercial, an announcer says, ``Coca-Cola
Classic salutes all Latinos for 500 years of contribution to our
America.''
   A specially-designed logo appears at the end of each ad showing
the outlines of three white sailboats against a blue background
atop red and white swirls that evoke the design of the Coca-Cola
Classic label.
   Yvonne ``Bonnie'' Garcia, director of Hispanic Consumer Markets
for Coca-Cola USA, said similar campaigns will be aired in the
Chicago, Miami, California and Texas markets featuring prominent
Hispanics from those areas starting next year and running through
1992.
   In addition, she said, a national version of the campaign
featuring Rita Moreno will be run on broadcast and cable networks
in 1990.
   Coca-Cola Co. is headed by a Latino. Its chairman and chief
executive, Roberto C. Goizueta, is from Cuba.

   Private pension funds are losing billions of
dollars through corruption, says a Labor Department study that
warns of a possible scandal to rival those involving the savings
and loan industry and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development.
   ``The vulnerabilities in this asset-rich employee benefit plan
arena today are being exploited by a new generation of racketeers _
attorneys, bankers, accountants, investment advisers,'' Raymond
Maria, the Labor Department's acting inspector general, told a
House subcommittee on Wednesday.
   Losses from the misuse of pension funds could total $4 billion,
twice the estimated losses in the HUD scandal, according to a Labor
Department study cited by Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of
the House Government Operations subcommittee.
   The level of corruption among 870,000 private pension plans has
mushroomed despite enactment of the 1974 Employment Retirement
Income Security Act, the subcommittee was told.
   ``When similar early warnings were ignored about the savings and
loan industry and about HUD program administration, the cost to the
American taxpayer and economy became staggering,'' Lantos said.
   Maria said there are several parallels between the savings and
loan crisis and problems that have surfaced in reviews of pension
plan audits.
   Among them are the size of the amounts of money involved, he
said, noting pension funds hold about $1.7 trillion in assets
compared with nearly $1 trillion in federally insured deposits held
by S&amp;Ls.
   Also, he said, the government ultimately must insure pensioners
against the loss of promised benefits, just like S&amp;L depositors are
insured against the loss of their deposits.
   However, Maria said there are fewer than 300 federal auditors
examining pension funds _ about one-twelfth the number of federal
S&amp;L examiners.
   Maria said efforts by his office to address the problem have
been frustrated by opposition from officials in a department
``which historically has turned its back on criminal sanctions.''
   He cited a Justice Department opinion last March sought by the
Labor Department's former solicitor that limited his office's
investigative role to union-affiliated plans.
   In a sample study of 168 private pension plans with $6.7 billion
in total assets, Maria's office found $18.7 million in misused
funds that was either lost or undisclosed in private audits by
public accountants.
   The independent auditors failed to perform suggested audit
procedures in 31 percent of the cases, he said, and 51 percent of
the audits lacked one or more disclosures required under the 1974
pension law.
   ``Further, we found that (independent audit) reports do not give
a fair opinion of the state of these plans'' because pension law
and Labor Department regulations allow ``limited scope reviews,''
Maria said.
   Those audits omit examination of any pension plan assets held in
trust by banks, insurance companies, S&amp;Ls and other financial
institutions regulated by the government, he said. He suggested the
pension law be changed to eliminate exemptions in auditing
procedures.
   Maria said Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole and her staff appear
``sensitive'' to the problem ``in direct contrast to previous
years'' but added he remains skeptical that recommendations for
reforms will be adopted.
   Deputy Labor Secretary Roderick DeArment questioned whether full
audits would be worth the cost but said his department is examining
the proposal.
   He also characterized as ``an historical phenomenon'' Maria's
complaint that the department has thwarted the pursuit of criminal
charges for violations of pension and other labor laws.
   ``I certainly don't have any aversion to criminal
investigations,'' DeArment said. ``Stealing from pensioners is
about as odious a crime as I can imagine.''

   The U.S. dollar inched up today against the
Japanese yen after a three-day decline, and the Tokyo Stock
Exchange's main index fell.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 119.53 points, or 0.34
percent, finishing at 34,779.81. It had gained 0.88 points
Wednesday.
   The dollar closed at 136.40 yen, up 0.20 yen from Wednesday's
136.20-yen close. In the previous three days, it had fallen a total
of 3.25 yen.
   Traders said currency trading was thin as the market awaited
Friday's scheduled release of U.S. jobless data for July.
   The dollar was pressured by predictions of further U.S. interest
rate declines, said Toru Kanai, foreign exchange analyst at New
Japan Securities Co. Lower U.S. interest rates make the dollar less
attractive to foreign investors.
   On the stock exchange, Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura
Securities, said, ``Following the index's rapid rise, surpassing
the 35,000-point mark yesterday, investors started to sell issues
for fear that prices had gone too high.''
   Trading was thin, with first section volume estimated at 500
million, down from Wednesday's 800 million.

<TEXT>
   A move to make a large California thrift a
bank may deprive the troubled savings and loan insurance fund of
millions of dollars and raise the taxpayer cost of the S&amp;L bailout,
officials say.
   Members of Congress who oversee banking agencies criticized the
move Wednesday, but said the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may not
have had a choice.
   The bank board ruled that Home Federal Savings and Loan
Association of San Diego, the eighth largest S&amp;L in the nation,
could leave the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.
   The move comes as the House prepares to pass a massive bailout
of the S&amp;L industry.
   The legislation, in response to the worst financial crisis since
the Depression, would pump an immediate $50 billion into government
deposit insurance funds depleted by hundreds of S&amp;L failures due to
poor and often fraudulent loans.
   It also would institute a major overhaul of the government's
regulation of the nation's nearly 3,000 thrifts and require their
owners to put billions of dollars more of their own money at risk.
   Home Federal is only one of several big S&amp;Ls trying to escape
FSLIC and join the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the commercial
bank fund that charges its members less for the same federal
insurance of $100,000 per account.
   But a bank board attorney said the Home Federal decision, which
must be ratified by the FDIC and by state regulators in a process
expected to take at least several months, doesn't set a precedent
making it easier for other institutions to flee.
   Nevertheless, the ruling is generating criticism in Congress.
   As part of the price for the bailout, S&amp;Ls will continue to pay
higher insurance premiums than banks for the next five years, even
if they convert to a bank.
   Home Federal is hoping to escape the higher premiums under a
provision of a 2-year-old bill that permits institutions to leave
provided they applied before March 31, 1987. Home Federal filed its
applications a day before the deadline.
   ``The net result will be the taxpayer cost will be driven up and
that's not something I support,'' said Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, a
member of the House Banking Committee.
   But, she added, ``in fairness to this particular institution,''
it meets the test for a special exception established in 1987.
   It is unclear, however, if the loophole will still be good if
Home Federal, as expected, is unable to complete its conversion
before Congress enacts new S&amp;L legislation, which has provisions
that would supersede the 1987 law.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., also a banking committee member,
said regulators may have had no choice but to rule in favor of Home
Federal.
   ``I think it's awful,'' he said. ``It sends a terrible signal.
... If there was a legal way to avoid the decision, it should have
been done.''
   John Buchman, a bank board staff attorney, said the Home Federal
decision, announced Tuesday, won't set a precedent favorable to
Homes Savings of America and Great Western, two Los Angeles-based
S&amp;Ls also trying to leave the FSLIC.
   The bank board denied an application from Great Western, the
nation's second largest thrift, which in June lost an attempt to
overturn the decision in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. It is
appealing.
   The bank board has until October to rule on the application from
Home Savings of America, the nation's biggest S&amp;L.
   The bank board has allowed 13 other S&amp;Ls to secede from the
FSLIC under the 1987 law, all considerably smaller than Home
Federal.
   Home Federal, which reported $17.2 billion in assets at the end
of May, has about 200 branches throughout California. Last year, it
paid $13.7 million more in insurance premiums than it would have as
a bank.
   Both bank and S&amp;L premiums would be raised under the S&amp;L bill,
but Home Federal would still pay about $9 million less in premiums
as a bank.

   Home Shopping Network libeled GTE Corp.
when it blamed its phone system for lost sales, ruled a jury that
awarded the communications giant $100 million in damages.
   GTE argued that the television retailer's problems were the
result of bungled management, not its phone system.
   ``We are very disappointed with the jury's verdict, and we will
appeal the decision immediately,'' said Nando DiFilippo, Home
Shopping Network's executive vice president and general counsel.
   Home Shopping Network sued GTE in September 1987, claiming it
lost millions of calls and $500 million in potential sales in 1986
and early 1987 because GTE telephone equipment could not handle the
volume of calls.
   GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., countersued, arguing the
over-expansion, competition and customer dissatisfaction, rather
than insufficient equipment, caused Home Shopping Network's losses.
   A Pinellas County jury Wednesday rejected Home Shopping
Network's $1.5 billion suit, instead awarding GTE Florida and GTE
Communications $50 million each for damage to their reputations and
credibility.
   ``The jury heard a lengthy and complex presentation of technical
issues, and it understood that the GTE companies had provided
quality service and equipment to help a small company grow very
quickly into a major business,'' said James C. Carideo, GTE Florida
vice president and general counsel.
   Home Shopping Network reported more than $8.4 billion in revenue
for the first six months of the year. Home Shopping Network, which
replaced the GTE phones with another system, reported nearly $730
million in sales last year but its stock has dropped from the
mid-$40s in 1987 to less than $4 a share.
   Viewers can only buy Home Shopping Network merchandise as long
as the item is being displayed on the screen. The Tampa-based
network said it lost 42 million calls when as much as 50 percent of
its incoming calls never reached sales operators because of the
allegedly faulty equipment.
   Home Shopping was cited for $20 million of the total award, with
$40 million each levied against Home Shopping Chairman Roy Speer
and President Lowell Paxson.

   Lynda Draper was watching a General Electric
repairman fix her refrigerator when she noticed him releasing
ozone-depleting freon into her kitchen.
   Suspicious of the procedure, the Ellicott City, Md., woman
complained earlier this year to GE, a company she knew well. Her
grandfather, father and husband had worked there.
   She didn't receive what she considered a satisfactory response.
   Thus began a chain of events that led Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn.,
to announce a landmark arrangement Wednesday in which one of the
best-known corporations in America agreed to keep up to 300,000
pounds of ozone-depleting freon from the marketplace.
   ``Hi, I'm the person that exposed GE emitting CFCs in my
kitchen, across the country and probably the world,'' Ms. Draper
said, introducing herself at a news conference called by Gore, who
negotiated the agreement.
   CFC is the abbreviation for chlorofluorocarbons.
   The company agreed, according to Gore and GE spokesman Jim
Allen, to offset whatever amount of freon is released as part of a
program to replace faulty refrigerator compressors.
   Ms. Draper said she was ``totally outraged'' at the freon
release, and contacted the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. The
environmental lobbying and research organization contacted Gore,
who has introduced legislation to ban CFCs.
   Gore agreed to negotiate with the company.
   The freon releases began in January, when GE began repairing the
compressors in large-size refrigerators sold in 1987 and 1988. The
work should be completed by year's end.
   Gore estimated the 5 ounces of the gas released from each
service call could total 300,000 pounds by the time the program
ends.
   The arrangement, Gore said, was ``breaking new ground,'' because
it would mean ``real reductions in the volume of CFCs now being
released into our air.''
   Allen, a spokesman for GE's appliance division in Louisville,
Ky., said he expected the offset would take place next year.
   GE, Allen said, hadn't decided exactly how to offset the
releases, but that the company has pledged to ``take off the
marketplace the amount we use in the (replacement) program.''
   While ozone is the chief ingredient of smog when close to the
ground, it protects against ultraviolet radiation at higher levels.
If a hole in the ozone layer develops and increased radiation comes
through, it could cause more skin cancer, cataracts, depressed
human immune systems and reduced crop yields, according to
scientists and the Environmental Protection Agency.
   CFCs also have been implicated in global warming, in which the
earth's heat is trapped, causing temperature increases, droughts,
heat waves and a rise in sea levels.
   Gore and William Walsh, of the U.S. Public Interest Research
Group, contended GE could have done more by using special equipment
to recapture the freon during repairs instead of releasing it into
the atmosphere.
   Allen said portable machines that could immediately recapture
the freon are not widely available and are unable to recycle the
gas during the repair process.

<HEAD>Farmers Spent More in '88 to Raise Crops, Livestock</HEAD>

   Farmers spent $118.4 billion in 1988 on
animals, feed, labor, machinery and other items needed to raise
crops and livestock, the Agriculture Department says.
   The 1988 figure represented a 7.5 percent increase over the
$110.1 billion spent in 1987, the department said Wednesday in the
report, ``Farm Production Expenditures.''
   Still, the figure falls short of the record $131.8 billion
farmers spent in 1981, just before the general financial crunch
that stalled expansion in the nation's agricultural sector.
   Annual spending by farmers reached its nadir this decade in 1986
_ $106 billion _ when many massively cut back their capital
investments during a time of plummeting land values and rising debt
burdens.
   Average expenditures per farm were $54,956, an increase of
$4,165 from 1987. The top 16.8 percent of farms _ those with annual
sales of $250,000 or more _ accounted for more than 68 percent of
the total expenditures.
   The figures suggest that raising livestock is a big-time
investment.
   Feed was the highest single cost item at $17.9 billion in 1988,
accounting for 15.1 percent of total costs. The previous year, feed
cost $14.9 billion and accounted for 13.5 percent of expenses, the
highest single expense item that year as well.
   The livestock and poultry that devour that feed cost $13.6
billion, accounted for 11.5 percent of the total. The previous
year, the cattle, swine and poultry cost $10.7 billion, accounting
for 9.7 percent of the total.
   Farmers bought $3.9 billion worth of agricultural chemicals in
1988, about the same amount and percentage as the previous year;
about the same percentage and dollar amount of fertilizer, lime and
soil conditioners, $6.9 billion worth; and the same percentage and
dollar amount of seeds and plants, 3.7 billion. Those items
accounted for 12.3 percent of the total.
   The machinery to do farm work cost $11.5 billion, for 9.7
percent of total expenses, up from $10.9 billion.
   A composite category _ farm services, including rent, _ was the
largest, $24.6 billion or 21 percent of the nation's production
expenses. That's up from $24 billion in 1987.
   That category includes cash and share rent, vet supplies and
services, marketing and storage expenses, insurance, utilities,
leasing and transportation.
   The only expenses to fall were interest, which decreased 3.7
percent to $8.37 billion, and building and fencing, which fell 10.3
percent to $2.23 billion.
   The analysis dealt only with production expenditures and did not
include figures for net income or profits.

   China and India together produce more than
half the world's rice, but both are importing huge amounts this
year, the Agriculture Department says.
   China is forecast to become a net importer of rice for the first
time in recent history, the department said in a report released
Wednesday.
   The report, ``Rice: Situation and Outlook Yearbook,'' says
demand in China, Indonesia and India will bring trade this year to
a record 13.4 million metric tons, surpassing the 1981 high of 13.1
million metric tons.
   China imports rice to feed its urban populations. The 1990
forecast says farmers will keep more rice on the farm because of
the government system of paying farmers with IOUs that can't be
redeemed immediately.
   China is expected to buy 1.2 million tons of rice this year from
all sources, the report said. That is triple the amount bought the
previous year.
   ``It is unclear how or if the current turmoil in China will
affect its short-term rice trade,'' the report said.
   Indonesia is expected to import 400,000 tons and India will
likely take in 500,000 tons in 1989 as they try to replenish stocks.
   Although the United States will increase its exports 10 percent
this year, to 2.5 million metric tons, Thailand will be the big
winner, exporting a record 5.5 million metric tons.
   World rice prices soared to $8.91 per hundredweight in July,
after having fallen to $5.90 in December.

   East Asia, especially Japan and Korea, are
major buyers of U.S. fruit juices, the Agriculture Department says.
   The foreign agriculture service said Wednesday that shipments of
horticultural products such as fruits, juices, nuts, vegetables and
hops to points other than Canada were valued at $252 million in May.
   That was is up 3 percent from April and 4 percent from May 1988,
the agency said.
   Shipments to East Asia accounted for 64 percent of fruit juices
exports, with Japan receiving the bulk.
   Canada is the primary market, accounting for 60 percent of total
horticultural exports.

<HEAD>Michigan to Produce Australian Company's Engine</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan officials and an Australian
industrialist have joined together to build a smaller, more
fuel-efficent engine that could herald a new phase for the auto
industry.
   Orbital Engine Co. of Perth, Australia, will convert a former
General Motors Corp. plant in Tecumseh at a cost of $250 million to
build a three-cylinder engine, Gov. James Blanchard said at a news
conference at Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn Wednesday. The plant
will employ 700 people.
   The engine uses 30 percent less fuel, is 40 percent as large as
a conventional engine and would cost $80 to $200 less each to
produce, according to Ralph Sarich, president and founder of
Orbital who developed the engine.
   ``This is a very appropriate setting because what you see here
is an amazing invention,'' Blanchard said.
   The engine is a major advance in engineering technology that
could make all engine technology obsolete, Blanchard said.
   Operating with two strokes instead of the standard four, the
engine is quieter, lighter, more fuel efficient, cleaner burning
and cheaper to produce than conventional engines, Sarich said.
   Treasury Secretary Robert Bowman said the state has invested $5
million from its pension fund in the project.
   ``This is not a social investment, we expect to make a great
deal of money,'' Bowman said.
   The state also will provide job training and start-up
assistance. The plant, owned by GM, will be leased to Orbital by
the Lenawee County Development Corp., Orbital said in a written
statement.
   Conversion of the Tecumseh plant would begin in 1990, Commerce
Director Doug Ross said, with production of a marine engine getting
under way in 1992. Production of the auto engine is scheduled to
begin in late 1993 or early 1994, Sarich said.
   The Australian entrepreneur credited the state's aggressive
pursuit of the project with his decision to build here.
   Members of the Commerce Department traveled to Australia in 1986
to recruit the company.
   ``We believe it was essential to work with an organization with
the same ambition and dynamics as us,'' said Sarich, whose said his
company has $480 million in capital.
   Sarich Technologies Ltd., which owns Orbital, has licensing
agreements with Ford Motor Co., GM, Walbro Corp., Outboard Marine
Corp. and Brunswick Corp. Marine Division.
   Sarich said Ford and GM assisted in testing the engine.
   ``There's no sophisticated industry in Perth,'' Sarich said,
referring to the area as ``bamboo country.''

   The alleged creator of a computer ``worm''
that invaded and immobilized thousands of computers across the
country in November has pleaded innocent to a felony charge.
   In a five-minute arraignment Wednesday before U.S. Magistrate
Gustave DiBianco, Robert T. Morris, 24, of Arnold, Md., entered the
plea to a one-count indictment handed up last week by a federal
grand jury.
   The indictment charged Morris with gaining unauthorized access
to computers, preventing authorized access to computers and causing
losses in excess of $1,000 under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act
of 1986. It is the first time felony charges have been brought
against an individual using the three-year-old law.
   Federal prosecutors charge that Morris created the worm program
that clogged a computer network shared by colleges, research
centers and the military.
   It took several days to cleanse the system of the worm, which
multiplied out of control, overloading the memories of the computer
systems it invaded. Computer industry experts estimated the down
time and working hours needed to combat the worm cost from $5
million to $12 million.
   The suspended Cornell University graduate student was released
on his own recognizance. He ignored reporters' questions during his
court appearance.
   Thomas Guidoboni, Morris' attorney, would say only: ``They did
charge him and now they have to prove it.''
   ``We want to preserve the integrity of the government's computer
system _ not just the government, but the entire computer
community,'' said Justice Department attorney Mark Rasch.
   If convicted, Morris faces a maximum five-year jail sentence and
$250,000 fine.
   According to the indictment, Morris' worm invaded computers at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research
Center in California and the U.S. Air Force Logistics Command at
Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, as well as dozen of
universities.
   The trial is not expected to begin before next year.

<HEAD>China to Crack Down on Tax Evasion by Private Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced it will inspect the
nation's 14.5 million private businesses in a bid to recover almost
$5 billion in revenue lost through tax evasion.
   The State Taxation Bureau will check the books and tax
registrations of private industrial, commercial and service
enterprises in August and September for signs of tax evasion or
other illegal activities, Chinese newspapers reported Wednesday.
   About 70 percent to 80 percent of all private businesses evaded
a total of more than $4.94 billion last year, far exceeding the
$2.53 billion in tax revenue collected, the bureau said.
   ``What is more serious is that a few lawbreakers attack tax
collectors and prevent them from carrying out their duties,''
stated the Communist Party newspaper, the People's Daily.
   The inspections are intended to establish a ``clear-cut order
for private business people to fulfill their obligations to the
state,'' said tax bureau director Jin Xin.
   Jin said illegal businesses would be closed and illegal income
confiscated.
   Private companies in China are required to pay 52 percent of
their profits to the government as taxes and to reinvest 30 percent
in business expansion, leaving only 18 percent as income for the
owners, he said.
   The inspections are part of an effort to more strictly regulate
China's small private sector, which is flourishing at the expense
of state-owned firms, Jin said.
   At the end of last year, there were 14.5 million private
businesses employing more than 23 million people in China.
   The government also is cracking down on corrupt tax collectors,
who are prohibited from accepting gifts from tax-free and
tax-reduced businesses to help ``ensure an honest and clean
government,'' the official Xinhua news agency said.
   Employees of the tax bureau are not allowed to go on junkets or
hold meetings in tourist spots, live in luxurious hotels during
inspection trips, build luxurious office buildings or apartments,
host banquets or send gifts, Xinhua said.
   The restrictions are part of a national anti-corruption drive
triggered by the student democracy movement that was crushed in
June after drawing hundreds of thousands of supporters with such
slogans as, ``oppose corruption.''

<HEAD>GEC, Siemens Make Bid $3.3 Billion For Plessey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG on
Thursday made a fresh offer for Plessey Co. PLC that values the
British electronics company at 2 billion pounds, or about $3.3
billion.
   The $4.46-a-share offer followed Wednesday's news that the joint
bidders had reached an agreement with the British government on
conditions for a renewed bid.
   Plessey had no immediate comment, a secretary said.
   The new offer replaces an original $2.8 billion bid that
automatically lapsed in January following the government's decision
to investigate the impact the combination would have on competition
in Britain's electronics industry.
   Plessey shares sank 20 cents a share to $4.36 on London's Stock
Exchange following the news.
   In a statement, the West German and British electronics giants
said they ``believe that Plessey on its own lacks the resources and
capability to sustain, let alone improve, its profitability over
more than the short-term.''
   The Department of Trade and Industry cleared the companies to
bid for Plessey provided they agreed to several conditions intended
to preserve competition in the defense electronics industry.
   GEC and Siemens have pledged that GEC won't take any interest in
the Plessey radar, military communications and traffic controls
businesses. Originally the companies had planned for GEC to take a
35 percent interest in Siemens' defense interests after the merger.
   The two also agreed to make available the technology on the
Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, a project for which
Plessey and GEC were competing. The British defense ministry
insisted on this measure in hopes of encouraging a new company to
take up Plessey's role as a rival developer.
   The companies also agreed that Siemens, as the potential owner
of the Plessey defense companies, would name only British citizens
directors of the units and that Siemens employees given access to
sensitive Plessey defense contract work would undergo British
security clearance procedures.
   Apart from the defense-related areas, GEC and Siemens plan to
take equal shares in Plessey's electronic components and other
businesses. GEC also intends to make Siemens a minority partner in
its existing telecommunications joint venture with Plessey, GEC
Plessey Telecommunications.
   GEC is not related to the similarly named U.S. company.

<HEAD>Non-Farm Productivity Up Slightly In Second Quarter</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The productivity of American workers increased
at an annual rate of 0.2 percent in the second quarter of 1989, a
modest improvement from a decline in the first three months of the
year, the government reported today.
   The Labor Department's preliminary data for the April-June
quarter showed that output in the non-farm sector of the economy
rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.7 percent, while
total hours worked climbed 1.5 percent.
   The 0.2 percent gain compared with a 1.3 percent drop in
non-farm productivity in the first quarter.
   The data showed hourly compensation paid non-farm workers
climbed at an annual rate of 5.5 percent in the second quarter but
continued to lag behind the rate of consumer inflation.
   In real dollars _ wage gains minus the toll of inflation _
hourly compensation fell at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the
April-June period, the Labor Department reported.
   The report is the first look at productivity in the second
quarter. The preliminary data often are revised when a final report
on the quarter is issued a month later.
   Manufacturing productivity increased at an annual rate of 2.4
percent in the second quarter _ a seemingly encouraging sign at
first glance but also an indication of the slowing economy.
   The productivity gain in manufacturing came as output climbed at
an annual rate of 2.1 percent and hours worked decreased 0.3
percent.
   When broken down, that data showed that productivity increased
among manufacturers of durable goods _ items expected to last more
than three years _ but declined among makers of nondurables.
   Manufacturing has been among the hardest hit sectors of the
economy in the recent slowdown and today's data showed that real
wages paid manufacturing workers declined for the sixth time in the
last 10 quarters.
   In the second quarter the hourly compensation for manufacturing
workers rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent _ down from a 3.1
percent gain in the first quarter and well behind the growth in
consumer inflation, which has been climbing at an annual rate of
more than 6 percent.
   In another gauge that includes the farm sector, the Labor
Department said productivity increased at an annual rate of 0.9
percent in the second quarter, with output rising 1.4 percent and
hours worked growing by 0.4 percent at seasonally adjusted annual
rates. Those figures have been influenced by the rebound from last
year's drought.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The royal mint will issue a series of
four gold coins denominated in European currency units next
December, the mint's director said Thursday.
   Director Romain Coenen said the mint has received instructions
from the Finance Ministry to produce the ECU coins using gold
reserves held by the Banque Nationale de Belgique.
   Coin sales are expected to result in a $71 million profit for
the treasury, newspapers said. The ECU is a marker for the
currencies of the 12-nation European Community.
   The series will include a one-ounce, 100-ECU coin bearing the
image of Austrian Empress Marie-Therese valued at $112.
   Similar one-ounce gold coins, such as the American Eagle and the
Canadian Maple Leaf, currently trade for about $383.
   A half-ounce, 50-ECU, or $56 coin, depicting the European ruler
Charlemagne will also be minted, as well as a quarter-ounce,
25-ECU, or $28 piece of Roman Emperor Diocletien.
   The lowest denomination coin will be a one-tenth ounce _ 10-ECU,
or $11.20 piece with an image of Charles V.
   The mint plans to produce 160,000 of each type of coin.

<HEAD>Eastern Signs $210 Million Sales Agreement with Midway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines plans to seek federal bankruptcy
court approval of an agreement to sell routes, gates and aircraft
to Midway Airlines for $210 million.
   The agreement is part of the Miami-based carrier's strike
recovery plan, the companies announced Wednesday. Eastern plans to
seek the approval within 10 days.
   The sale involves gates at Philadelphia International Airport
and Eastern routes from Philadelphia to Montreal and Toronto. The
deal also includes operating slots at Washington's National Airport
and New York's LaGuardia Airport, 16 DC-9 jetliners with spare
engines and parts.
   Eastern has begun a restructuring that includes the sale of $1.8
billion in assets, including the sale to the Chicago-based Midway,
to emerge from bankruptcy court as a smaller carrier.
   The two carriers reached a tentative agreement on the package in
mid-June, about six weeks after the disabling strike by Eastern
machinists forced the carrier to file for financial reorganization.
Midway arranged the financing for a closing this fall.
   ``This is part of our asset-disposition program,'' said Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell. ``We said that we would be disposing of
$1.8 billion in assets, so this is a fairly significant component
of that program.''
   At a public meeting of creditors in New York Wednesday, an
Eastern attorney said the company still expects to reorganize and
emerge from bankruptcy protection by the end of the year.
   ``This has not been a usual case from the outset. It's been an
extremely accelerated case,'' said Bruce Zirinsky, a bankruptcy
attorney for Eastern. ``At this time, we still think it's
realistic,'' he said, to come out by year's end.
   More than 1.2 million meeting notices were sent to creditors and
ticket holders. About 60 people attended the session in the Felt
Forum auditorium at Madison Square Garden, which seats around 4,500.
   A contingent of non-union employees from Eastern's reservations
center in Woodbridge, N.J., wanted to know if they would receive
outstanding overtime payments and other benefits.
   Also on Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland
approved the pilots union's request that its pay claims against
Eastern be submitted to arbitration. The company's liability could
be as much as $250 million in back pay, according to the union.
   ``The pilots still have to prove their claim, and we don't
believe that they will,'' Matell said late Wednesday.
   Eastern succeeded in boosting its daily flights to 350 Tuesday
as part of its strike-recovery plan. Eastern's first service to Rio
de Janeiro started Wednesday, and three flights are scheduled each
week, Matell said.
   The number of scheduled flights is 60 percent higher than last
month and about one-third of the pre-strike level.
   Eastern's reorganization plan filed July 21 proposed full
repayment to creditors and ticket holders totalling around $3.3
billion. Consumers would have the option of either a cash refund or
tickets for new flights.

<HEAD>Ferruzzi Drops Suit Against Board of Trade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Italian grain company has dropped its lawsuit
challenging a Chicago Board of Trade order that may have prevented
the firm from cornering the U.S. soybean market, exchange officials
said today.
   But the Italian concern, Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA, said its
withdrawal of the U.S. District Court lawsuit was ``a technical
matter only'' and that it is still preparing a suit seeking
compensation for the losses it incurred as a result of the Board of
Trade's order.
   Ferruzzi has denied trying to corner the market.
   The suit had sought to bar the exchange from enforcing its July
11 order requiring all traders to reduce their holdings in the July
soybean futures contract.
   U.S. District Judge James Zagel in Chicago denied the request on
July 13 and the July soybean contract expired on July 20, rendering
the lawsuit moot.
   Ferruzzi said it withdrew the lawsuit on Tuesday.
   ``Withdrawing the suit, which applied to an act governing a
period which is now over, is a technical matter only,'' the company
said in a statement.
   Nevertheless, the Board of Trade hailed the action as a victory,
saying the exchange ``welcomes this action, which demonstrates the
integrity of futures market self-regulation at the Board of Trade.''
   Prior to the Board of Trade's order, Ferruzzi said it held
contracts to take delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans, while
Board of Trade officials said that at the time, only about 12
million bushels of soybeans were available for delivery against
those contracts.
   Ferruzzi, one of the world's largest soybean processors, has
denied trying to corner the market, saying it needed all the
soybeans it had contracted to buy in order to keep its plants
running and meet the demand for its products.

<HEAD>GAO Says Congress Should Consider Reviving Cable TV Regulation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress should consider reviving regulation
of the cable TV industry, a General Accounting Office spokesman
said today after unveiling a survey showing basic cable rates have
risen 29 percent since deregulation.
   ``I think it's time to fully re-examine re-regulation,'' John M.
Olf, Jr., director of housing and community development issues for
the GAO, told a House subcommittee. ``With no competition, no
limited regulation, I believe we have a monopoly.''
   But an industry spokesman said consumers are getting their
money's worth from cable TV.
   ``Cable subscribers are getting a lot more for their money than
was the case 16 years ago, or even three years ago,'' James P.
Mooney, president and chief executive officer of the National Cable
Television Association, said in testimony to the Energy and
Commerce Committee's telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
   ``Moreover, the quality of cable programming _ something
impossible to measure statistically but nonetheless real _ has
improved markedly over the past couple of years,'' Mooney said.
   In 1986, Mooney said, subscribers had an average of 27 channels
at a cost of 44 cents each, while the average rose to 32 in 1988 at
a cost of 46 cents each.
   The monthly cost for the least expensive basic cable service
increased 29 percent between December 1986, when the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984 took effect, and October 1988,
according to the GAO study.
   Chairman Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., requested the study to
help evaluate the effect of deregulated cable rates on consumers.
   The monthly fee for the basic service increased from $11.23 to
$14.48 during the study period, the GAO said, adding that the
average number of channels increased from 24 to 30.
   The report found that the average monthly cost for the most
popular basic service, which may have options such as remote
control, rose 26 percent, from $11.70 to $14.77.
   But despite the stiff increases for the two types of basic
service, the GAO said the average subscriber's monthly bill rose
only 14 percent, from $21.58 to $24.68.
   Mooney said that one factor that spurred the increased costs was
the effort by the relatively young industry to upgrade its plants
and add channels.
   Cable companies channeled $246 million into those efforts in
1986, $292 million in 1987 and $417 million in 1988, he said.
   Mooney also said that the cost of cable rose just 1.6 percent
during the first six months of this year, while the Consumer Price
Index rose 3 percent.
   ``This strongly suggests that the post-deregulation adjustment
in cable rates is over,'' he said, predicting ``a more normal
curve'' in 1989 and subsequent years.
   Under deregulation, the Federal Communications Commission
allowed cable television companies, which since 1972 had to receive
permission from local authorities to raise prices for basic
service, to set their own rates.
   Despite the higher prices, the GAO study said cable
subscriptions have risen 15 percent. Fifty-five percent of
households with televisions, or 49 million subscribers, have cable.
   The GAO interviewed cable operators, as well as federal, state
and local officials to compile its report. The agency also randomly
selected 1,950 cable systems nationwide to survey, receiving 1,451
usable responses.

   Antique jewels. Patek Philippe
watches. Tiffany lamps. Tudor chairs. Impressionist paintings.
   Middle-class Argentines are selling family heirlooms accumulated
during more affluent times in Argentina for the money they need to
get through these days of hyperinflation and economic collapse.
   Art dealers are flocking in from abroad to snap them up.
   ``People are keener to sell for cash right now,'' said Pierre
Yves Gabus, a Geneva-based art appraiser and auctioneer. ``People
want dollars and they are selling what they have to get them.''
   Gabus arrived three years ago. Since then, he has set up shop in
three other cities, and watched as competitors flocked to join him
in Buenos Aires.
   Fabian Ayerza, an assistant director of Sotheby's, said, ``At
the beginning of this century, Argentines traveled often to Europe
and they used to buy quite good things.''
   Now, treasures carried across the Atlantic in the staterooms of
luxury ocean liners are returning home in jetliners.
   ``There's no way to know the volume,'' said Alicia Arteaga, a
reporter who covers art for the newspaper La Nacion. ``A lot of
galleries come in, buy $500,000 worth of French chairs, and leave.''
   Every day, ads appear in newspapers promising cash for antique
furniture, tapestries and rugs, necklaces, autographed manuscripts,
signed crystal and, perhaps most of all, paintings.
   A Patek Philippe watch can fetch $7,000. A sculpture by Mariano
Benlliure y Gil, $330,000. A set of Dutch chairs from the 18th
century, $2,500 each.
   The painting ``Two Gypsies'' by Joaquin Sorolly y Bastida sold
for $140,000; the painting ``The Flight'' by Charles Edouard
Delort, $100,000.
   Buyers particularly want the Impressionist and ``Little Master''
paintings of the mid and late 19th century that were bought by
landowners flush from the sale of beef and grain from their
sprawling estates.
   The best private collections aren't for sale; the richest
Argentines are weathering what is for them the latest downturn in a
decades-long period of stagnation.
   But many children and grandchildren of families whose fortunes
have declined are looking on living room walls and in closets,
jewelry chests and basements for treasures.
   Not a few wind up disappointed.
   ``They bring in an incomplete set of dishes or some old chairs
and a table they bought 40 years ago thinking they are antiques,''
said dealer Franco Levi. ``They don't realize that to be an
antique, something needs to be at least 80 to 100 years old.''
   Fernando Sanchez Zinny, the director of Christie's in Argentina,
said many Argentines bought indiscriminately and lugged home fakes.
   ``It's disastrous for someone who has had a painting hanging on
the wall for many years, thinking it is worth a lot of money, then
we go in there'' and tell them it is worth very little, Sanchez
Zinny said.
   The best pictures fetch prices from $50,000 to $1 million,
dealers said. Some are sold outright. Most are sold on consignment.
   ``A Flemish painting that was bought here for $40,000 sold for
five times that amount in the United States,'' said Mauro
Herlitzka, a collector.
   Argentines don't seem worried by the outflow of such valuable
objects.
   ``It's not like Argentina is losing its cultural heritage,''
said Mrs. Arteaga. ``It's stuff that was brought here and now it's
going back to where it came from.''

<HEAD>American Talks to Soviet Airline About Access</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two American Airlines vice presidents
met with officials of the Soviet national airline Aeroflot in
Moscow last month about gaining access to the Soviet air travel
market.
   American spokesman John Hotard said Wednesday the American
executives involved in the meetings were Hans Mirka, vice president
for international services, and Arnold Grossman, vice president for
international marketing and planning.
   ``They went over there and had some very good meetings with
Aeroflot, but it's too early to say what will come of it,'' Hotard
told The Dallas Morning News.
   Aeroflot is the largest airline in the world; American is the
biggest U.S. carrier.
   In June, Aeroflot launched its first major marketing campaign in
the United States and increased its flights from New York and
Washington to Moscow from five a week to eight. The Soviets also
plan to build about 25 new hotels in the next two years to handle
an increase in foreign tourists.
   The U.S. government last month turned down American's request
for the right to fly from Chicago to Moscow. Pan Am Corp., which
flies from New York to the Soviet capital in a joint venture with
Aeroflot, is the only U.S. airline authorized to fly to Moscow.
   ``If you don't have route authority, you have to look for ways
to get around that,'' Hotard said.
   The two airlines may set up an arrangement under which American
would buy a set number of seats on Aeroflot flights from, for
example, New York to the Soviet Union. American could then sell the
seats to travelers making connections from American flights to New
York.
   Likewise, Aeroflot could buy seats on American flights from New
York to major U.S. cities not served by the Soviet airline.

<HEAD>Chain Stores Post Modest Sales Growth in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's big retailers today reported modest sales gains
for July, continuing a trend that illustrates the weakness in
consumer spending.
   Results varied, with some store chains enjoying better business
than others, but industrywide the month was a ho-hum one for
retailers, said Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
   Feiner said sales growth was ``in general modest and to a large
degree reflected the generally sluggish overall economic
environment.
   ``Importantly, slowing growth in employment, weak personal
income growth and continued relatively high interest rates have
continued to pressure consumer confidence,'' he said.
   Although July is normally a slow time for shopping, analysts
keep track of monthly sales figures from department stores,
discounters and general merchants for clues about consumer
behavior. Consumer spending supplies about two-thirds of the power
for total economic activity.
   In recent months, mediocre sales at many stores across the
country have signaled that consumers have reacted to rising
mortgage payments and increases in other credit costs by curtailing
shopping trips.
   With sales tallies coming in below expectations, retailers will
face extra pressure to capitalize on business during the rest of
the year as the peak shopping season gets into full swing. Shopping
usually picks up in August with back-to-school promotions and gains
momentum leading up toward Christmas.
   Many industry analysts don't expect fickle customers to do too
much damage to retailers' profitability because store managers have
been carefully controling expenses and keeping inventories of
unsold merchandise to a minimum.
   Store executives' reactions to their July performances ranged
from pleased to dissatisfied.
   Michael Bozic, chairman of the merchandise group at industry
leader Sears, Roebuck and Co., said business was adversely affected
by weakness in sales of durable goods, which are expensive items
that consumers typically refrain from buying when they are feeling
financially pinched.
   Bozic said Sears' sales this year were being compared against
fairly strong results last year, which made the percentage growth
appear weaker than it was.
   The pickup in sales at K mart Corp. stores that began in June
continued into July said, Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   K mart, the country's second-biggest retailer had suffered
through several disappointing months earlier this year when Sears
created a stir with its new everyday low-pricing policy to win back
market share from discounters.
   Kenneth A. Macke, chairman and chief executive of Dayton Hudson
Corp., a Minneapolis-based owner of department stores and discount
chains, said the retailer will report strong second-quartern
earnings later this month based on recently good sales growth.
   F.W. Woolworth Co.'s Chairman and Chief Executive Harold E.
Sells said domestic sales of the New York-based chain were
unexpectedly robust, partly due to seasonal promotions and solid
growth in childrens' wear.
   At stores owned by Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., headquartered
in Los Angeles, sales were described as satisfactory by Philip M.
Hawley, chairman and chief executive. He said women's apparel
posted the best gains while cosmetics and women's accessories sold
well.
   The figures reported today were from major general merchandise
chains and apparel retailers. The government's monthly retail sales
report is more comprehensive, including sales at auto dealers,
supermarkets, restaurants and elsewhere.
   Here are some of the results:
   Sears said its sales edged up 0.4 percent in the four weeks
ended July 29 to $2.4 billion from $2.39 billion. But comparing
results at stores open at least a year, Sears' sales slumped 2.4
percent.
   Retailers and analysts consider these same-store or
comparable-store sales a more accurate reflection of a company's
performance than totals that include sales a newly opened stores.
   K mart, based in Troy, Mich., said its July sales rose 6.2
percent to $2.07 billion from $1.95 billion a year earlier.
Comparable-store sales were up 2.7 percent.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the third-biggest U.S. retailer based in
Bentonville, Ark., said July sales rose 24 percent to $1.98 billion
from $1.59 billion. Same-store sales gained 10 percent.
   Dayton Hudson's July sales rose 15.6 percent to $896 million
from $775 million in the year-ago month. Comparable-store sales
were up 6.9 percent.
   Carter Hawley Hale's July sales rose 4.9 percent to $180.7
million from $172.3 million in July 1988. The same-store sales
growth was 4 percent.
   Woolworth's July domestic sales went up 9.7 percent to $339
million from $309 million a year earlier. Same-store sales rose 4.8
percent.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were modestly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting a variety of bearish factors topped by forecasts for
more rain in the Midwest.
   The National Weather Service issued a six-to-10 day forecast
late Wednesday calling for above-normal rainfall over much of the
Midwestern soybean and corn growing areas during the middle portion
of next week.
   Weak cash markets prompted further selling of corn and soybean
futures, traders said.
   News that the Italian grain processor Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA
had dropped a lawsuit against the Board of Trade also weighed on
soybean prices. The action suggests Ferruzzi may reduce its soybean
holdings rather than risk another confrontation with the exchange.
   The lawsuit challenged an exchange order requiring traders to
reduce their holdings in the July soybean contract, which expired
on July 20, rendering the lawsuit moot. The order was seen as a
move to prevent Ferruzzi from cornering the soybean market.
   Wheat futures were lower in sympathy with the corn and soybean
markets.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in September at $3.88\ a bushel; corn was \
cent to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.20 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to } cent lower with September at $1.32} a bushel.
soybeans were 1\ cents to 5\ cents lower with August at $6.03 a

   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .15 cent lower to .30 cent higher with August
at 73.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent
higher with August at 83.67 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with August at 46.30 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .08 cent to .28 cent higher with August at 26.20 cents

   J.H. Whitney &amp; Co. said Thursday it has entered
negotiations toward lowering its $1.2 billion offer for Prime
Computer Inc.
   Although Whitney is willing to continue to seek financing for
its $21.50-a-share bid, ``we believe, based on our efforts to date,
that such financing will probably not be available,'' said Don E.
Ackerman, a partner in the New York venture capital firm.
   Prime, based in Natick, makes minicomputers and computer-aided
design and manufacturing systems. After it reported a $19 million
quarterly loss last week, two banks asked Whitney to seek
additional financing.
   Prime's board agreed to the merger with Whitney after fending
off a hostile, $970 million bid from MAI Basic Four Inc. of Tustin,
Calif.
   MAI, controlled by investor Bennett S. LeBow, is now seeking to
buy Prime's minicomputer business for $525 million.
   Whitney extended its current offer for Prime's common shares
until midnight EDT Aug. 8.

<HEAD>Forecasting Gauge Down Again in June</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Insert 2 grafs of White House comment after 11th graf, The Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that its chief
economic forecasting gauge fell in June for the fourth time in five
months, providing fresh evidence that the U.S. economy is entering
a period of sluggish growth.
   The Commerce Department's Index of Leading Economic Indicators
dipped 0.1 percent in June. While the amount of the decline was
small, the weakness was widespread, with seven of the index's 11
individual indicators flashing negative signals.
   The small decline had been expected by analysts, who are
debating whether the economy's slowdown will worsen into a
recession.
   Traditionally, the signal for an economic downturn has been
three consecutive monthly declines in the leading index. The index,
however, rose in April, breaking the string of declines.
   The forecasting gauge dropped in February and March, then rose
0.6 percent in April before plunging 1.3 percent in May. That was
the biggest one-month setback since late 1987 following the stock
market crash in October of that year.
   Economists note that the index is not infallible. The index
declined for five consecutive months in late 1987 and early 1988.
But no recession followed and, in fact, economic growth accelerated
to its fastest pace in four years.
   Some forecasters, however, now believe the economy is on the
verge of a recession, even if the index has not yet dropped for
three consecutive months.
   ``We are seeing a mild recession developing in the United States
right now,'' said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with the New York
brokerage firm of Merrill Lynch.
   Steinberg said he believed forthcoming data would show that the
economy went into a slump in the current July-September quarter and
the downturn will last until January.
   But more optimistic forecasters believe the economy, while
entering a sluggish growth period, will be able to scrap by without
an outright recession, defined as at least two consecutive negative
quarters for the gross national product.
   The Bush administration is even more optimistic, forecasting
that GNP growth, which weakened to an annual rate of 1.7 percent in
the April-June quarter, will rebound in the second half of the year.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of today's
report: ``The weakness in the leading indicators over recent months
is consistent with our view that economic growth is likely to
remain relatively soft over the second half of 1989.''
   ``It does show ... that the economy is softening in the last
half of the year. We think we'll continue to see the economy grow
but at a more moderate pace than the 3.7 and 4.4 percent growth for
1987 and 1988,'' Fitzwater said.
   The index was held back in June by declines in seven of its 11
components.
   The biggest drag came from a decline in prices for raw
materials. While that is good for the economy in that it signals
lower inflationary pressures, it is considered a negative for the
leading indicators because it can signal declining demand.
   Other negative forces in June were a rise in weekly unemployment
claims, a drop in building permits, a change in business delivery
times, a drop in the length of the average work week, a fall in
orders for consumer goods and weakness in the number of unfilled
orders.
   Four indicators showed strength during the month, with a rise in
stock prices making the biggest positive contribution. Other
positive forces were a rise in consumer confidence, faster growth
of the money supply and an increase in plant and equipment orders.
   The various changes left the leading index at 143.5 percent of
its 1982 base of 100.
   In the first six months of the year, the leading index has
fallen at an annual rate of 2.1 percent. By contrast, the index
rose by 4.5 percent in all of 1988.
   After a year of pushing interest rates higher to fight
inflationary pressures, the Federal Reserve reversed course in June
and began lowering rates in an effort to keep the economy out of a
recession.
   Many forecasters believe the Fed will be able to successfully
engineer a so-called ``soft landing,'' in which growth slows enough
to dampen inflationary pressures without pitching the country into
a downturn.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Tuesday that he
believes the central bank can pull off its economic balancing act,
but he said economists won't know for sure whether the country is
out of the woods until well into 1990.
   Greenspan, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee,
said businesses have been able to keep their inventories in check,
avoiding the type of dangerous growth in unsold inventories that
normally precedes a recession.

<HEAD>British Airways' Profit Up 17 Percent in First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC said its fiscal year got off
to a good start with a 17 percent gain in its first-quarter profit.
   The airline reported Thursday that its net profit for the three
months ended June 30 was 62 million pounds, or about $102 million,
compared with 53 million pounds, or $87.5 million, in the same
period a year earlier.
   Per-share earnings rose to 8.6 pence, or 14 cents, from 7.4
pence, or 12 cents.
   First-quarter revenue rose 14.7 percent to 1.17 billion pounds,
or $1.9 billion, from 1.02 billion pounds, or $1.7 billion.
   British Airways was privatized by the Thatcher government in
February 1987.
   ``We have made a competent takeoff into our new financial year
but as we fly through our peak season, we are aware of a small
patch of turbulence,'' said the airline's chairman, Lord King.
``There may be further softening of the economy, we must take
further action to control our costs and we must alert ourselves to
increasing competition.''
   King noted that the year-earlier results were depressed by the
acquisition of rival British Caledonian Airways. He said British
Caledonian was still being integrated into British Airways'
structure.
   Capacity on scheduled flights was limited to an increase of only
2.4 percent, largely because of late delivery of new Boeing 747-400
aircraft, British Airways said.
   The airline said it is still holding discussions on taking a 20
percent share in Sabena World Airlines of Belgium. KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines also is expected to take a 20 percent share in Sabena,
according to a preliminary plan, with the remaining 60 percent to
be held by the Sabena SA holding company.

<HEAD>Midland Posts Loss; Lambastes Brady Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midland Bank PLC on Thursday posted a $632 million
loss for the year's first half after boosting its provisions for
losses on loans to Third World countries.
   Midland, Britain's third-largest bank based on deposits,
increased its loan loss reserves by $1.4 billion, from $81 million
a year earlier and blamed a United States initiative for
encouraging delinquency among debtors.
   Among its peers, Midland has the greatest exposure to debts of
less developed countries.
   Losses totaled $632 million in the first six months of the year,
compared with a $295 million profit in the same period a year
earlier.
   Pre-tax profit before exceptional provisions was $520 million,
little changed from $516 million a year ago. Total assets were up
by 17.6 percent to $108 billion, from $92 billion.
   Speaking at a news conference, Midland Chairman Sir Kit McMahon
criticized U.S. Treasury Secretary James Brady's Third World debt
initiative as ill-conceived and destabilizing.
   McMahon cited a ``greater reluctance of a number of debtor
countries to service their debt'' following the Brady Plan's
announcement in March.
   McMahon said the plan ``encouraged worse behavior by debtors''
since countries would delay payments amid expectations that their
debts would be reduced.
   McMahon echoed the sentiments expressed recently by the chairmen
of other top British banks, although his criticism was harsher.
   The Brady Plan calls for banks to design debt-reduction packages
for highly indebted countries that plan economic reforms. The
packages are to be supported, in part, by the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Japan.
   The agreement between Mexico and its 15-bank advisory committee,
announced last week, marked the first breakthrough for the Brady
initiative.
   Under the accord, which covers the country's $52.5 billion of
commercial bank debt, banks can choose from three options: they can
exchange their loans for new 30-year bonds with a below-market
annual interest rate of 6.25 percent; or for bonds with a discount
from face value of 35 percent that have floating market rates. Or
they can provide new loans.
   McMahon said Midland would choose the second option, which would
cover $1.4 billion of its medium- and long-term loans to Mexico.
   ``We do this sadly because we do not believe in debt forgiveness
for debtors,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., under pressure from its banks,
said Thursday it has entered negotiations to reduce its $1.2
billion offer for Prime Computer Inc.
   After Prime, a Natick-based minicomputer maker, reported a $19
million quarterly loss last week, two of Whitney's banks asked it
to obtain additional financing.
   Whitney, a New York-based venture capital firm, indicated it has
been unable to find that financing at its current offer of $21.50
per share of Prime's outstanding common stock.
   ``Although we are willing to continue to seek financing at the
$21.50 level, we believe, based on our efforts to date, that such
financing will probably not be available from our current financing
sources on a basis satisfactory to all financial participants,''
said Don E. Ackerman, a Whitney partner.
   Prime spokesman Joseph Gavaghan confirmed that the companies are
negotiating possible changes in their June 23 merger agreement but
declined to comment on how much the price might drop.
   Prime's board of directors agreed to the merger with Whitney
while fending off a hostile, $970 million bid from MAI Basic Four
Inc. of Tustin, Calif.
   MAI, a computer firm controlled by New York investor Bennett S.
LeBow, has since offered to buy Prime's minicomputer business for
$525 million.
   Wall Street analysts said if Whitney cuts its offer
significantly, LeBow might be able to launch another bid for all of
Prime.
   ``It's like an on-going soap opera on TV. It doesn't go away,''
analyst Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said of the long
takeover battle, which began with MAI's offer last November.
   An MAI spokeswoman in New York said it had no immediate comment
on Whitney's announcement.
   Prime, which has 11,200 employees worldwide, reported revenue of
$1.6 billion last year, about one-third from minicomputers. The
company also produces computer-aided design and manufacturing
systems, a business that was enlarged substantially when Prime
acquired Computervision Inc. for $435 million in a hostile takeover
last year.
   As the minicomputer industry faces a general slump, Whitney's
banks apparently believe Prime needs more financing to withstand
continuing losses and turn itself around.
   Stevens said he is ``very concerned about the survivability of
Prime'' but believes it has a better chance of returning to
profitability if it remains whole than if the minicomputer business
is sold separately.

   Share prices ended slightly lower Thursday as the
market struggled to find direction in a crosscurrent of conflicting
signals.
   A price-cutting exercise by market makers, poor company earning
reports, and new weakness in the pound combined to depress buying
interest, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended down
1.5 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,306.3, below a session high of
2,310.3. At its lowest, the index touched 2,298.0, a fall of 9.8
points.
   Volume was 550.1 million shares, up from 424.8 million shares
Wednesday.
   News of a renewed, 2.04 billion-pound ($3.4 billion) bid by
General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG for Plessey Co. PLC, and a
slight upturn on Wall Street, helped support the market at lower
levels.
   Dealers said selling pressure remained minimal. ``Any decent
line of stock up for sale at a reasonable price sells pretty
quickly,'' one trader said.

   The dollar rose against major foreign currencies
in Europe Thursday on fears over the hostage situation in the
Middle East.
   Gold prices moved up in quiet European trading after falling in
Asia.
   Dealers said it was unclear how far the dollar would rise on the
news of American ships moving to the Middle East.
   Some speculated that traders were talking the dollar up ahead of
Friday's release of U.S. unemployment figures for July. If the
figures prove disappointing, traders will be cushioned from a sharp
fall in the dollar by its already higher levels.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose .20 yen to close at 136.40 yen. Later

   The pound was down even though the Bank of England entered the

traded at $1.6475 Thursday, down from $1.6635 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:

<TEXT>
   The House today passed and sent to the Senate
a $159 billion bailout of the savings and loan industry, defying a
last-minute veto threat from President Bush.
   The 221-199 vote set up a confrontation in the Senate, where
minority Republicans vowed to block passage in hopes of forcing
Democrats into negotiations with the White House over the bailout's
financing plan.
   Bush said in his veto threat that he hoped for agreement on a
new bill by Friday, when Congress is scheduled to begin a
month-long recess. Final congressional action on the measure would
give the administration the money necessary to close or merge
hundreds of insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   The vote in the House was short of the two-thirds needed to
override a veto. Supporting the bill were 182 Democrats and 39
Republicans. Voting against it were 67 Democrats and 132
Republicans.
   In a letter to congressional leaders, Bush complained that the
legislation, as adopted by a House-Senate conference last week,
sets a precedent that could undermine the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law.
   The president called for a compromise on the thorny issue before
the House and Senate adjourn for the August recess.
   But Democratic leaders rebuffed him. Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell said Bush's proposal for calculating the cost of
the bailout was ``fiscal gimmickry at its worst'' that would add $5
billion in interest costs.
   Bush's objection to the Democratic plan centers on the method
for calculating the cost in the federal deficit. The legislation
would balloon the budget deficit but the bailout cost would not be
included in calculations requiring automatic spending cuts in
federal programs.
   Bush favors evading the cuts by simply keeping the spending out
of the deficit in the first place.
   ``If the conference report is presented to me in its current
form, I will veto the bill,'' he said.
   Democrats complain that the president's method, which requires
that a private agency borrow bailout money, will inflate borrowing
costs.
   ``To charge the American people more to hide budget costs is a
crime and we're not backing off,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking Committee. ``There's no way
to compromise. It's cutting the baby in half.''
   But Bush wrote, ``While Gramm-Rudman-Hollings is not perfect, it
represents the only available institutional requirement for fiscal
discipline by the Congress and the executive branch.'' He was
referring to the law that requires automatic spending cuts if the
deficit exceeds specified targets.
   ``Exempting $44 billion in spending from this budget process ...
would be unprecedented. It would also seriously undermine the
future value of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings as a source of budgetary
resraint, risking adverse effects on both markets and the
economy,'' the president said.
   He added that he was ``prepared to work with Congress to bridge
the divergent positions on the financing issue'' to preserve the
budgetary discipline. ``It is essential to resolve this dispute
this week before Congress adjourns for the August recess,'' he said.
   The veto message threatened one of the critical pieces of
legislation making its way through Congress this year.
   Treasury Department officials have said previously they were
open to compromise on the accounting issue, provided the final
agreement does not set a precedent for circumventing the
deficit-control law.
   The legislation, in response to the worst financial crisis since
the Depression, would pump $50 billion into government deposit
insurance funds depleted by hundreds of S&amp;L failures due to poor,
and often fraudulent, loans.
   It also would institute a major overhaul of the government's
regulation of the nation's nearly 3,000 thrifts and require their
owners to put billions of dollars more of their own money at risk.
   S&amp;Ls would have to devote more of their lending to home
mortgages. Their investments in risky real estate ventures would be
curtailed and their purchases of junk bonds would be outlawed.
   Banks, for the first time in nearly six decades, could own
healthy S&amp;Ls, enabling them to buy out their most competitive
lending market rivals in many communities.
   Including the interest payments on the $50 billion being
borrowed and the cost of meeting obligations on S&amp;L rescues in
1988, the package is expected to cost a minimum of $159 billion
over the next 10 years, according to the Office of Management and
Budget. The OMB had earlier estimated the cost at $157 billion, but
revised the projection in line with the administration's latest
economic forecast.
   House and Senate conferees agreed on all the measures last week.
   House Republicans generally have folded their opposition to the
Democratic financing plan, but Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, claimed to
have enough votes to tie up the bill until Democrats concede on the
point.

<HEAD>Drexel Junk Bond Financing Examined in Oklahoma Bankruptcy Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has been ordered to
turn over thousands of documents in an Oklahoma bankruptcy case to
answer questions about whether its junk-bond financing contributed
to an oil company's downfall.
   The unusual Chapter 11 proceedings for Texas International Co.
mark what legal experts believe is the first bankruptcy court
attack on an investment firm that arranged high-interest financing
for a company that later went belly-up.
   Drexel maintains its financing for Texas International not only
was proper but enabled the foundering company to stay in business
longer than it would have otherwise.
   Nonetheless, the case raises the possibility of similar
bankruptcy challenges elsewhere if companies that have issued $200
billion in junk bonds over the last decade don't perform well
during an economic downturn.
   Already in 1989, Southmark Corp., with about $800 million in
Drexel junk-bond debt, has filed for bankruptcy protection from
creditors. The financial concern Integrated Resources Inc. recently
defaulted on close to $800 million in Drexel junk debt.
   Drexel pioneered the widespread use of junk bonds _ low-rated,
high-interest debt securities _ for corporate financings, mergers
and takeovers, although most major Wall Street firms now deal in
the securities.
   In 1977, Drexel issued its first-ever corporate junk bonds for
Oklahoma City-based Texas International and restructured $389
million of the company's long-term debt in the mid-1980s.
   Attorneys for the stockholders committee of Texas International
now claim that terms of the refinancings may have been too severe
for the struggling energy company.
   They also have questioned whether Drexel may have misstated
facts during debt exchange offers in 1985, 1986 and 1987; may have
abused securities laws in conducting the exchange offers; or may
have manipulated the price of company stock around the time of the
offers.
   The attorneys haven't said what actions they're contemplating
against Drexel and haven't offered proof for their ``suspicions''
aired in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   No charges against Drexel have been filed in the case and Texas
International has said in court documents it has no evidence of
wrongdoing or harm by Drexel.
   Drexel, which faces dozens of unrelated lawsuits based on its
settlement of federal civil and criminal securities fraud charges,
fought a subpoena issued last December ordering it to produce
documents about its Texas International deals.
   In one court document, Drexel said the company's shareholders
committee relied on ``a hodgepodge of vague, unsupported
speculations'' to justify a search.
   ``Not a single fact is recited that could give rise to any
inference of liability or misconduct on Drexel's part,'' lawyers
for the New York-based firm said.
   But federal bankruptcy law permits such a sweeping inquiry _
what the judge in the Texas International case called a ``fishing
expedition'' _ to determine what caused the bankruptcy and whether
creditors, shareholders or the company were harmed.
   Drexel, already burdened by other lawsuits spun off from its
past troubles, effectively is being forced to defend itself in a
case where no formal charges have been made. The practice could
affect other Wall Street firms should bankruptcies increase.
   ``The junk bond issuers are going to look to find someone to sue
_ and they're going to look to whoever the underwriter is,''
Columbia University law professor Mark Roe said. ``There will be
more lender liability cases in a recession, of which this might be
a portion.''
   According to documents filed in bankruptcy court in Oklahoma
City, Drexel holds $21.76 million of the $166 million in debt
comprising most of the claims against Texas International.
   Drexel also owns an unspecified amount of stock in the company,
some of which was issued to cover the debt; was responsible for
creating the market for Texas International stock on the Pacific
Stock Exchange; and was the company's financial adviser.
   ``It seems to us that there a number of questions relative to
Drexel's conflict of interest, holding of securities, potential
different agenda that should be investigated ...,'' Charles E.
Ramsey Jr., Texas International's court-appointed bankruptcy
examiner, testified at a May 18 hearing on whether the inquiry was
necessary.
   The shareholders committee also used in its argument Drexel's
recent agreement to pay $650 million and plead guilty to six
felonies to settle Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges
stemming from the government's insider-trading crackdown.
   Texas International's case includes many prominent Drexel
players, including Michael Milken, the former Drexel junk-bond
financier indicted earlier this year on unrelated charges.
   Milwaukee attorney Benjamin Waisbren, who represents Texas
International shareholders, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Richard
Bohanan that Drexel should be investigated partly because the
pattern of activity in the SEC suit coincided with the Texas
International refinancings.
   Texas International was not mentioned in the SEC's wide-ranging
complaint against Drexel last September.
   Waisbren said in court that the three Drexel-arranged exchange
offers included new debt that was to be serviced by issuing stock
until the company could pay cash.
   But he said the offers were ``not feasible'' because the value
of the stock was inadequate to service the debt. Company documents
place the shortfall at $63 million in 1986 and $76 million in 1987.
   Rejecting Drexel's challenges, Bohanan in June ordered Drexel to
turn over documents from its high-yield bond division in Beverly
Hills, Calif., and to provide access to employees who worked with
Texas International from 1985 through 1988.
   Texas International, an oil and gas production and exploration
company with operations in Egypt, Malaysia and the United States,
has lost more than $384 million since 1981. Already loaded with
debt entering the 1980s, the company was hoping for an oil price
rise.
   But the industry slumped and Texas International either had to
renegotiate debt payments or declare bankruptcy, company officials
said. Drexel was paid $6.075 million in fees for the exchanges,
records show.
   Drexel and company officials said the debt exchanges worked,
temporarily reviving Texas International's stock price and
strengthening its cash base. But oil prices plunged and the company
failed to improve.
   ``We advised Texas International on three exchange offers which
at the times alleviated cash difficulties for the company, and
which were well-received by the professional investor market and
which were largely successful,'' Drexel stated in response to
questions by The Associated Press.

   A rash of defaults among companies that have
borrowed heavily by selling high-yield debt securities is raising
fear that a recession could wallop the nation's $200 billion market
in so-called junk bonds.
   Nonetheless, the people who deal in junk bonds say a recession
won't be disastrous, and some economists agree.
   ``You're heading toward at best an economic slowdown, at worst a
recession,'' said David Wyss, senior economist with DRI-McGraw-Hill
Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``Under those conditions you're going to
get defaults.''
   In a recent study, Wyss concluded that a recession would trigger
more junk bond defaults but that high returns would easily offset
losses if bond buyers keep diversified portfolios.
   Junk bonds are so named because they pay high rates of interest
to compensate for their low or nonexistent credit rating. Junk
bonds have become an enormously popular financing technique for the
growth of small companies and to raise money for debt-financed
takeovers, known as leveraged buyouts.
   This year, junk bond industry officials say, about $3 billion in
junk bonds have stopped paying interest or are undergoing a
restructuring as part of overhauls by struggling companies.
   Integrated Resources Inc., which has $798 million in junk debt
underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., defaulted in June.
Southmark Inc., with $757 million in oustanding Drexel junk debt,
entered bankruptcy court in mid-July.
   SCI Television has defaulted on $475 million in junk, while the
thrifts Gibraltar Financial Corp. and Western Savings &amp; Loan
Association defaulted on interest or principal payments on more
than $100 million each.
   But Integrated and Southmark don't reflect peril, junk backers
say, because the financial concerns were hard hit by changes in
federal tax laws in 1986. They say more defaults indicate only that
the junk market has grown.
   Drexel, the pioneer of the junk bond market, says that $12.5
billion or 6.6 percent, of the total $197 billion in bonds issued
since 1977 have defaulted. That converts to an annual average
default rate of 2.4 percent.
   According to Drexel figures, 23 percent of junk bond defaults to
date were by energy companies, which have suffered because of oil
price declines; 9 percent were by Public Service Company of New
Hampshire, which has been struggling because of costs associated
with a nuclear plant; and 8 percent were in the steel industry,
which has lost to foreign competition.
   ``Historically speaking, recessions have had very little impact
on high-yield bond default rates,'' said Joe Bencivenga,
co-director of research for Drexel's high-yield bond department in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   A report by Moody's Investors Service in July found that 3.3
percent of junk bond issuers defaulted on long-term bonds each year
between 1970 and 1988. Over a 10-year period, the rate was 17
percent. Moody's put the annual default rate for investment-grade
bonds at 0.06 percent.
   In June, a Harvard Business School study alarmed the market by
reporting that 29.3 percent of new junk bond issues defaulted from
1979 to 1988.
   On Capitol Hill, a compromise bill to bail out the nation's
savings and loans would prevent thrifts from using their deposits
to invest in junk bonds. The concern is that the thrifts, which own
more than $14 billion in the bonds, shouldn't risk customer
deposits.
   A General Accounting Office report in March concluded that
high-yield bonds did not contribute to the thrift crisis. But it
said investing in the securities remains risky.
   ``The high-yield bond market, in its present size and form, has
not been tested by a recession,'' the report stated. ``A severe
economic downturn might increase bond defaults, especially for
those companies issuing bonds as part of leveraged buyouts.''

<HEAD>OPEC Production Remains High in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OPEC nations continued to pump oil at a
robust rate in July despite promises to curtail their crude output,
according to estimates released Thursday.
   The International Energy Agency said in its Monthly Oil Market
Report that the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries produced about 21.3 million barrels a day last month, the
same as in June. Those were the highest levels so far this year.
   The cartel set a production ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a
day for the last half of the year in an effort to keep a firm grip
on output and control prices. OPEC set $18 a barrel as a target
price for the seven types of crudes that it monitors.
   But production has remained strong, and prices have weakened.
   West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, which
normally sells at about $2 above OPEC-monitored crudes, has fallen
nearly $6 since April when it sold at more than $24 a barrel. After
stabilizing in the $19-$20 range for several weeks this spring and
summer, prices recently slipped to the $18 level.
   Analysts see few signs that nations ignoring their new supply
quotas will cut back, and their actions may spur others to cheat as
well. OPEC ministers raised their production ceiling in June from
18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of the year to 19.5
million.
   ``The situation is becoming more dangerous for OPEC,'' said
Fergus MacLeod, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.
   OPEC's eight-member monitoring panel will meet in Geneva on
Sept. 23 to take a look at the market and decide whether to boost
the production cap to 20 million barrels a day in the final three
months of the year.
   The meeting was officially scheduled for just the eight
committee members, but ministers of the other five member nations
also were expected to attend.
   MacLeod said chances were diminishing that the cartel would lift
its output ceiling in the last quarter because of a slowdown in
demand for OPEC oil.
   Figures supplied by the International Energy Agency put demand
for OPEC oil in the second half of this year at about 21.3 million
barrels a day, some 400,000 barrels above earlier estimates.
   Demand, however, is expected to tumble to about 20.7 million
barrels a day in the January-June period of 1990, analysts said.
   The OPEC nations sharply trimmed their production starting late
last year year to comply with an output accord fashioned in
November to boost prices. Their cutbacks, combined with accidents
in oil-producing regions like the North Sea and perceptions of
supply problems due to the Exxon oil spill in Alaska, helped kick
prices up to unexpected levels last spring.
   Prices have eased recently, however.
   The average price of seven major crude brands monitored by OPEC
was $16.58 in the last week of July, under the $18 target. But it
was well above the average price of $12.34 recorded at the end of
last November.
   To meet the present target, a number of countries would have had
to cut their output, but the energy agency's figures indicate that
hasn't happened.
   Kuwait, for example, produced an estimated 1.6 million barrels a
day in July, above its OPEC quota of 1.1 million barrels a day.
Output for the United Arab Emirates, a persistent cheater, was
about 1.8 million barrels a day, well over its quota of 1 million
barrels.
   Nigeria's output was estimated at 1.6 million barrels a day,
higher than its quota of 1.4 million barrels.
   Saudia Arabia, the world's No. 1 oil exporter, pumped 4.7
million barrels a day last month, about the same as its quota.
   Iraq and Iran were recorded at their quota levels of 2.8 million
barrels a day, as was Venezuela at 1.7 million barrels, the energy
agency reported.
   The other OPEC members produced near their targets: Indonesia,
1.2 million barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Algeria, 700,000
barrels; Qatar, 400,000 barrels; Libya, 1.1 million barrels; and
Gabon, 200,000 barrels.
   OPEC recently acknowledged that its members supplied more crude
to the world market in June than allowed under their production
agreement.
   OPEC differs from other analysts in the way it measures
adherence to its production agreements. It calculates a nation's
quota by figuring crude production and then subtracting, or adding,
the amount of oil put into, or drawn out, of stocks.
   The International Energy Agency is part of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development, which is made up of 24
Western nations, including the United States, Japan, France and
West Germany.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices plummeted to their lowest
levels in more than 20 months Thursday on the Chicago Board of
Trade on selling linked to the Italian grain merchant Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A.
   Traders said several brokerages that are believed to have close
ties to Ferruzzi were heavy sellers in the soybean pit.
   The sell-off followed news that Ferruzzi had dropped a lawsuit
it had filed against the Board of Trade challenging the exchange's
July 11 order requiring traders to reduce their holdings in the
July soybean contract.
   The order was widely perceived as a move to prevent Ferruzzi
from cornering the U.S. soybean market.
   But a federal judge had denied Ferruzzi's request for an
injunction and the July soybean contract expired on July 20,
rendering the lawsuit moot.
   Ferruzzi was believed to have complied with the order by
shifting its huge market position from the July contract into the
August contract, which sustained the steepest losses Thursday.
   At the close, soybeans were 2 cents to 26\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in August at $5.82 a bushel, the lowest close
for a near-month soybean contract since Nov. 19, 1987.

<HEAD>American Eagle To Open Miami Hub</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK REYNA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines significantly boosted its
presence at Miami International Airport Thursday by announcing that
its commuter carrier, American Eagle, will open a hub at the home
base of strike-crippled Eastern Airlines.
   American Eagle President Robert E. Martens said the commuter
carrier plans to open the hub Oct. 1 with 20 flights daily from
Miami to the Florida cities of Key West and West Palm Beach. It
plans to expand to 66 a day by adding flights to Fort Myers,
Marathon and Naples, all in Florida, by the end of the year.
   The commuter service also will seek approval from the U.S.
government and the government of the Bahamas to schedule flights
from Miami to the Bahamian towns of Freeport, Marsh Harbour and
Treasure Cay.
   The announcement at a news conference at the airport marked the
latest in a series of moves by American, the nation's largest
carrier, to expand operations out of Miami, a market once dominated
by Eastern.
   American set up a pilot and flight crew base in Miami last
January, announced plans to expand in the market last April and
last week opened a new concourse at Miami International.
   ``By closely coordinating the Miami schedules of American Eagle
and American,'' Martens said, ``we are able to provide our
customers with the convenient connecting service that they have
come to expect from us.''
   Most of Eastern's flight attendants and pilots walked off the
job March 4 in support of striking Machinists, and the airline has
been under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection while struggling to
stay in the air as a smaller carrier.
   Eastern managed to boost the number of its flights Tuesday to
350, about a third of its 1,100 pre-strike daily flights. American
Eagle announced Thursday that combined American and American Eagle
flights from Miami should total 144 a day by the end of the year.
   Barbara Lind, manager of sales development for American Eagle,
denied that the Miami expansion of the commuter service and of
American was prompted by Eastern's weakened position.
   ``American has always planned to have a Miami hub,'' Ms. Lind
said. ``It has been part of our 5-year plan for quite a few years,
so it's not something that happened overnight because of the
misfortunes of Eastern Airlines.''
   The new connecting hub would mark the start of American Eagle
operations in Miami.
   American Eagle now serves 138 small and medium-sized cities, Ms.
Lind said, feeding passengers into major cities for American.
   She said American Eagle, which has acquired a 5,500-square-foot
passenger lounge at Miami International, has begun hiring for the
approximately 75 positions it expects to open in Miami.
   ``We would like to keep our hiring local to all of the cities
that we are opening,'' she said.
   Asked if American Eagle would hire striking Eastern employees,
Ms. Lind responded, ``yes, if they qualify.''
   She also confirmed American's interest in buying Eastern's
profitable Latin American routes, if the routes come up for sale.
   ``We would love to expand in Central and South America, and
Miami would be a perfect place to do that from,'' she told The
Associated Press.
   But both Ms. Lind and American spokesman Jim Brown, at the
carrier's Dallas headquarters, refused to say if American and
Eastern were negotiating such a deal.
   ``I'm afraid I can't comment on any specific negotiation,''
Brown told AP. ``We are a buyer of assets, of route authorities, a
buyer of gate facilities, a buyer of slots. Whenever a company
approaches us, we certainly listen to what they have to say.''

<HEAD>Big Retailers Post Modest July Sales Pickup</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Retail Sales-Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's major retailers Thursday posted minor to moderate
July sales gains, with some chains benefiting from further good
results in women's apparel.
   But the sales growth at store chains around the country partly
reflected improvements from weak business last summer and didn't
imply that a rebound in consumer spending has begun, retail
industry analysts said.
   Although July is normally a slow time for shopping, analysts
keep track of monthly sales figures from department stores, mass
merchandisers and discounters for clues about consumer behavior.
Consumer spending supplies about two-thirds of the power for total
economic activity.
   A relatively poor performance by industry leader Sears, Roebuck
and Co. illustrated the consequences of the sluggish pace of
consumer spending. Sears' tiny sales increase of 0.4 percent held
down the industry's average.
   An index compiled by investment firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
showed sales at 40 general merchandise chains, apparel and
furniture retailers rose 4.6 percent in July following June's 4.7
percent rise.
   Michael Bozic, chairman of the Sears merchandise group, said
overall results were adversely affected by softness in sales of
durable goods, which are expensive items such as ovens or
dishwashers that consumers typically refrain from buying when they
feel financially pinched.
   Consumers have reacted to rising mortgage payments and other
credit costs lately by curtailing shopping trips or postponing
purchases of items usually financed with loans until interest rates
recede.
   Bozic said Sears' sales last month were being measured against
fairly strong figures for the company in July of 1988, which made
the percentage growth appear weaker than it was.
   In contrast to Sears' weak performance, the second-biggest U.S.
retailer, K mart Corp., reported business momentum continued to
build while third-ranked Wal-Mart Stores Inc. outperformed the
industry, as it usually does.
   The pickup in sales at K mart that began in June continued into
July said, Joseph E. Antonini, chairman and chief executive officer.
   K mart had suffered through several disappointing months earlier
this year when Sears created a stir with its new everyday
low-pricing policy to win back market share from discounters.
   Drexel's Jeffrey Edelman said retailers specializing in women's
wear had the best news to report. Women have been updating their
wardrobes this year after boycotting fashions for two years.
   He said discounters also did better than earlier this year.
``But I would not look at this as an indication that there's been
an upturn in consumer spending,'' Edelman said.
   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., said the
sales gains were ``in general modest and to a large degree
reflected the generally sluggish overall economic environment.''
   With tallies coming in below plan for many months of 1989,
retailers will face extra pressure to capitalize on business during
the rest of the year as the peak shopping season arrives. Shopping
usually picks up in August with back-to-school promotions and
gathers momentum to Christmas.
   Between 65 percent and 75 percent of retailers' annual earnings
come from business done in the second half of the year.
   Many industry analysts don't expect lower sales to damage
retailers' profitability much this year because store managers are
controlling expenses and keeping inventories of unsold merchandise
as low as possible.
   The figures reported Thursday were from major general
merchandise chains and apparel retailers. The government's monthly
retail sales report is more comprehensive, including sales at auto
dealers, supermarkets, restaurants and elsewhere.
   Here are some of the results:
   Sears, based in Chicago, said its sales edged up 0.4 percent in
the four weeks ended July 29, but, comparing results at stores open
at least a year, Sears' sales slumped 2.4 percent.
   Retailers and analysts consider these same-store or
comparable-store sales a more accurate reflection of a company's
performance than totals that include sales at newly opened stores.
   K mart, based in Troy, Mich., said its July sales rose 6.2
percent and comparable-store sales were up 2.7 percent.
   Wal-Mart, with headquarters in Bentonville, Ark., said July
sales rose 24 percent and same-store sales gained 10 percent.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., based in Dallas, reported a 12 percent
overall sales gain in July and a 9.7 percent rise in same-store
sales.
   Dayton Hudson Corp., a Minneapolis-based owner of department
stores and discounters, said July sales rose 15.6 percent and
same-store sales were up 6.9 percent.
   May Department Stores Co., based in St. Louis, said last month's
total sales rose 8.1 percent while same-store sales were up 6
percent.
   Specialty apparel retailer Limited Inc., based in Columbus,
Ohio, said July sales went up 12 percent and by the same percentage
on a comparable store basis.

<HEAD>GEC, Siemens Renew Bid For Plessey</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG on
Thursday made a fresh, $3.4 billion bid for Plessey Co. PLC and
quickly boosted their stake in the British electronics company to
29.9 percent.
   Sources said the joint bidders spent $495 million snapping up
Plessey stock, bringing their holdings to the maximum allowed under
British takeover rules.
   Plessey rapidly rejected the offer as ``totally inadequate,''
saying the British and German electronics giants had made ``a major
price miscalculation.''
   Analysts conceded that the price was at the low end of Plessey's
recent trading range but noted that the joint bidders were likely
to be successful.
   The $4.46-a-share offer came one day after the British
government announced an agreement with the bidders on conditions
for renewing their bid for Plessey.
   The new offer replaced the original $2.8 billion bid that GEC
and Siemens launched in November. That bid automatically lapsed in
January when the government decided to investigate what impact such
a combination would have on competition within Britain's
electronics industry.
   The purchase of 113 million Plessey shares lifted GEC's and
Siemens' stake a further 15 percent, sources said. The bidders are
prohibited from buying more Plessey shares until after the first
closing date of their offer.
   On London's Stock Exchange, Plessey sank 15 cents a share to
finish at $4.41.
   Analysts said they were doubtful that Plessey could find a white
knight or devise an effective defense at this stage. But several
said the offering price might not be high enough to win over some
institutional shareholders.
   ``I'm surprised that they've made it a final offer,'' said John
Tysoe, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Securities in London.
   GEC and Siemens said they wouldn't increase the offer under any
circumstances, including the emergence of a counter-offer.
   In a statement, they said, ``Plessey on its own lacks the
resources and capability to sustain, let alone improve, its
profitability over more than the short-term.''
   But the bidders may have provided Plessey with a slight
possibility of fending off the bid as too low, Tysoe said.
   It ``does give Plessey the chance to wriggle away,'' said an
electronics industry analyst at a London brokerage firm, speaking
anonymously.
   Plessey Chairman Sir John Clark said in a statement: ``To have
offered such a low price for Plessey after an attempt which has
lasted almost nine months shows a total lack of understanding of
Plessey and of its immediate and long-term value to its
shareholders.''
   Plessey's strategy has been to criticize the lack of value that
the bidders have placed on Plessey's recent acquisition-driven
expansion into such areas as computer equipment as well the
company's core electronics businesses.
   It also has said that in trying to put together a merger plan
that was palatable to Britain's defense and trade ministries, GEC
and Siemens have come up with a contrived structure that has
``nothing to do with industrial logic.''
   The Department of Trade and Industry cleared GEC and Siemens to
bid for Plessey provided they agreed to several conditions intended
to foster competition in the defense electronics industry.
   Among other things, GEC and Siemens have pledged that GEC won't
take any interest in the Plessey radar, military communications and
traffic controls businesses. Originally the companies had planned
for GEC to take a 35 percent interest in Siemens' defense interests
after the merger.
   GEC is not related to the similarly named U.S. company.

<HEAD>Ferruzzi Drops Moot Suit Against Board of Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian grain merchant Ferruzzi Finanziaria SpA
said Thursday it had dropped a moot lawsuit challenging a Chicago
Board of Trade order apparently aimed at preventing Ferruzzi from
cornering the U.S. soybean market.
   The Board of Trade termed the move a victory, but Ferruzzi said
its withdrawal of the U.S. District Court lawsuit was ``a technical
matter only'' and that it still planned to sue the exchange for
losses incurred when it was forced to sell more than 20 million
bushels' worth of soybean futures contracts.
   Ferruzzi has denied trying to corner the market.
   The withdrawn lawsuit, filed in Chicago, sought an injunction
overturning the Board of Trade's July 11 order requiring all
traders to reduce their holdings in the July soybean futures
contract to 1 million bushels by July 20.
   Judge James Zagel denied the injunction request on July 13 and
the July soybean contract expired on July 20, rendering the suit
moot.
   Ferruzzi said it dropped the lawsuit Tuesday, noting the suit
applied to an act governing a period that now was over.
   ``We continue to prepare a lawsuit that will seek compensation
for the damages Ferruzzi suffered'' as a result of the order, the
Milan-based company said.
   Nevertheless, the Board of Trade said it welcomed the suit
withdrawal, ``which demonstrates the integrity of futures market
self-regulation at the Board of Trade.''
   Ferruzzi has said that before the Board of Trade's liquidation
order, it held contracts to take delivery of 23 million bushels of
soybeans in July.
   Board of Trade officials said only about 12 million bushels of
soybeans were available for delivery against those contracts.
   The exchange said it issued the order, which did not mention
Ferruzzi, to prevent defaults on contracts to deliver soybeans and
to ensure the orderly expiration of the July contract.
   Ferruzzi, one of the world's largest soybean processers, has
denied trying to corner the market, saying it needed all the
soybeans it had contracted to buy in order to keep its plants
running and to meet the demand for its products.
   Traders said the company appeared to comply with the order by
selling July contracts and buying August contracts, effectively
rolling its huge market position into the next delivery month and
potentially setting up another confrontation with the exchange.
   But traders said that since the beginning of this week, brokers
who often handle Ferruzzi's orders have been selling large amounts
of soybean contracts, an indication the company was not seeking
another showdown.
   ``It doesn't look that way right now,'' said one soybean trader
who asked not to be named. ``Things could change but it really
doesn't appear that way.''
   The August soybean contract expires Aug. 22.

<HEAD>R. David Thomas: Founder Pitches Wendy's Hamburgers in New Ads</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R. David Thomas, the hamburger restaurant chain
founder starring in the new Wendy's commercials, has no interest in
elbowing Chrysler's Lee Iaccoca aside as one of America's
best-known executive pitchmen.
   The beefy high-school dropout who amassed a fortune peddling
fast food said he'd just as soon retreat to corporate obscurity if
Wendy's admakers could devise an alternative campaign that would
sell hamburgers.
   But for now, Thomas is trying to project grandfatherly sincerity
and folksy charm in a series of ads designed to reignite growth at
the company he named after one of his daughters 20 years ago this
fall.
   ``If it works, it's fine,'' Thomas, 57, said as he discussed his
new role in an interview. ``If it don't work, I'm gone ... I'm
history. When I get up in the morning, I'd rather see our stock go
up than me on TV.''
   He owns about 8 percent of Wendy's stock, worth about $40
million at recent market prices.
   The ad campaign comes at a potentially pivotal time for Wendy's
International Inc., a Dublin, Ohio-based concern that has lost
ground by some measures over the past few years among the nation's
fast-food chains.
   Average sales at Wendy's 3,762 restaurants rose 2.4 percent to
$759,000 per store last year, breaking a three-year slide. But
sales per store were well below the company's peak of $871,000 in
1984, when Clara Peller's commercial battle cry ``Where's the
Beef?'' helped stir consumer appetites for Wendy's.
   In those days, Wendy's ranked third among the fast-food chains
behind McDonald's Corp. and Burger King Corp., which continue to
claim the top two spots. But Hardee's Food Systems Inc. reported
average sales of $920,000 at its 3,200 restaurants in 1988, moving
ahead of Wendy's by that measure.
   Industry analysts say part of the reason for the decline is that
Wendy's advertising message became muddled after 1984.
   An ad called ``Russian Fashion Show,'' designed to emphasize the
choices Wendy's customers enjoy, generated laughs and awards but
sales per store fell in 1985. Campaigns over the next two years
using the themes ``Choose Fresh. Choose Wendy's'' and ``This is the
Good Stuff'' failed to halt the decline.
   In 1988, Wendy's and its new ad agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates
Inc., scored some points with its funny ``Hamburger A-Hamburger B''
ads in which a pitchman asked strange people to choose between a
fresh hamburger from Wendy's or an obviously inferior product from
someone else.
   The weirdos always picked Brand X.
   But that approach was a reprise of ads another agency had made
for Wendy's years earlier. Backer senior copywriter Jim McKennan
looked for something new.
   Thomas saw a few suggested approaches, didn't like them and
decided to urge the admakers himself to stress the basics of what
made Wendy's different _ fresh meat, choice of toppings and custom
preparation. ``I didn't think they knew what they was really
dealing with,'' he said.
   After hearing Thomas out, McKennan said Backer's creative
director, Bob Lenz, suggested that they try to talk Thomas into
being in the ads himself.
   Thomas had appeared in Wendy's ads in 1981, but his short
introductions to the commercials were overshadowed by the
controversy that arose over use of a double negative in the same
ads: ``Ain't no reason to go anyplace else.''
   Wendy's executives persuaded Thomas, who had stepped back from
company operations in 1982 by becoming senior chairman, to return
to the front lines.
   McKennan viewed it as a rare opportunity. Thomas founded the
first Wendy's in Columbus, Ohio, in 1969 and named it after his
daughter Melinda, who was then 8 years old and known to her brother
and sisters as ``Wenda.''
   Putting Thomas in ads would give the company a personality,
McKennan felt.
   ``The theme is that Wendy's is in his image _ American ideals
and hard work and giving people a lot for their money. What better
way to say that than have the guy who started the whole thing
deliver it,'' McKennan said.
   On the days they shoot ads, McKennan said he and Thomas go over
what the admakers would like him to say, and Thomas decides how he
would say it.
   In one ad, a curly-haired teen-ager sits beside Thomas at a
Wendy's, and Thomas says, ``Howdy, dude.''
   That was Thomas' idea, the founder grinned. ``In the script, he
called me dude. But I told them to let me call him dude, seeing
that he looked like one with that earring and all,'' he said.
   Thomas' performances in a half-dozen ads to date are unpolished.
McKennan said that makes them more believable.
   But there are limits to realism. Thomas tools around in a 1952
Studebaker in another ad, but it wasn't his. Thomas said he didn't
even like the car.
   His homespun appeal evidently isn't universal. Bob Garfield, an
ad critic for the trade journal Advertising Age, called Thomas ``a
steer in a half-sleeve shirt'' and said the ads wouldn't help
sales. But Wendy's executives say sales have improved in the past
two months.
   Some viewers find it jarring that Thomas says ``biness'' rather
than ``business'' in the closing line: ``Our hamburgers are the
best in the business or I wouldn't have named the place after my
daughter.''
   Thomas said the slurred word was simply a mistake, and promises
that he will pronounce it correctly in future ads.
   McKennan plans to argue against it. ``You don't want to take all
those edges off. It's one of those things that makes him
particular,'' he said.

<HEAD>Marauding Critters Mean Boom Times For Repellent Makers</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   With twitching antennae, buzzing wings and bloodsucking barbed
mouthparts that embed themselves in flesh like fishhooks, armies of
carnivorous insects this summer have caused a run on the sprays and
lotions that repel them.
   The unusually heavy infestation of flying and crawling pests
that prey on humans is giving the companies that make and market
repellents a lucrative season. Sales of insect repellents could
rise by 40 percent this year over 1988 to $70 million, some
industry insiders estimate.
   ``It's incredible! I just can't keep enough on the shelves,''
said John Learned, manager of Brooks Drugs Inc. in Burlington, Vt.,
part of what's become known as the ``tick belt'' that stretches
from New England to the Midwest.
   Learned said he's selling 10 times the amount of repellents
compared with last year and that many customers are buying a
half-dozen cans at a time.
   S.C. Johnson Wax, which makes OFF! and dominates the repellent
market, declined to disclose sales figures. But Richard J.
Palmersheim, product manager of OFF!, said the company expects
sales to be stronger this year because of a general increase in the
populations of all biting bugs nationwide.
   Even businesses that don't peddle chemical repellents are
benefiting, via sales of items ranging from screens to other
natural anti-bug defenses like garlic and brewer's yeast.
   Skin-So-Soft bath oil, for example, is said to be a hot-selling
insect repellent. Avon Products Inc., which makes the oil, doesn't
advertise it as such, though users have sworn by its bug-deterring
qualities for years.
   Entomologists attribute part of the repellent boom to
back-to-back summers of drought and heavy rains, which resulted in
double populations in many regions because dormant eggs from dry
1988 hatched in this season's moisture.
   They also credit the boom to a scare over Lyme disease, a
potentially crippling ailment named after the town in Connecticut
where it first surfaced in the 1970s. The disease is carried by the
Ixodes dammini, commonly known as the deer tick, a tiny but tough
critter that lurks on grass and leaves.
   Although these ticks are multiplying rapidly because of the
rising deer population, which the bugs breed on when they're young,
scientists say the furor over Lyme disease has reached unfounded
proportions.
   ``We're not likely to see an invasion of the body-snatching
ticks carrying off children,'' said Robert Hall, professor of
entomology at the University of Missouri in Columbia. He said
products that profess to protect against Lyme disease are ``an
effort to capitalize on the mild hysteria.''
   Many repellent makers are revamping marketing strategies to
highlight their products' effectiveness against deer ticks, which
hop on humans in the woods and can silently latch into flesh with
barbed mouths.
   In May for example, Eclipse Laboratories Inc., of Boca Raton,
Fla., introduced Tick Garde _ a repellent that uses the same recipe
as other well known products that cost a third as much. Eclipse
peddles its potion with advertisements that proclaim: ``This tick
is a time bomb.''
   Some reports project $5 million in Tick Garde sales this season,
which would be considered a remarkably strong showing for a new
repellent in an already crowded market.
   ``We're not trying to scare or alarm,'' said Eclipse President
Harvey Sosin. ``All we're trying to do is help educate the public
of something that does exist and is spreading.''
   He attributed Tick Garde's higher price to packaging and
advertising costs. The product comes in a sleek,
pharmaceutical-style box that looks like it might contain an
anti-perspirant. The box also contains a brochure that explains the
proliferation of Lyme disease and preventive measures.
   ``We spent a lot of money on that insert that is very
educational to the consumer,'' Sosin said.
   But Tick Garde has aroused anger among competitors because of
what they call its excessive price and unfounded claims of
exclusivity.
   For example, both Eclipse and Littleton, N.H.-based Tender
Corp., which sells a rival product called Ben's 100, market a
formula made by Speer Co. of Memphis, Tenn.
   Tick Garde sells for $8.95 a six-ounce aerosol can, nearly
triple the price of a comparable can of Ben's 100 aerosol, which
Tender President Boyd Bush called an identical product.
   Like virtually all other repellents used on the body, they are
based on the chemical compound N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide _
commonly known as DEET. It was developed by the government in the
1950s and first used by the military.
   DEET's aroma repels bugs by blocking their ability to identify a
warm, moist body it could feed on, said Roger Grothaus, entomology
director at Johnson Wax's bug lab near Racine, Wis.
   Johnson Wax began using DEET commercially in 1957 with the
introduction of OFF!, which it claims was the first mass-marketed
insect repellent.
   DEET does not thwart bees, wasps and hornets, though it has been
found to deter mosquitoes, biting flies and ticks.
   Experts say any compound containing more than 20 percent DEET is
effective against ticks. Tick Garde is about 25 percent DEET, but a
number of other products contain even more, increasing the length
of protection.
   In fact, many 100 percent DEET products are available _ like
Maximum Protection OFF!, Miles Laboratories Inc.'s Cutter Maximum
Strength and Schering-Plough Corp.'s Muskol Lotion. But these
products are used almost exclusively by avid outdoorspeople and
usually are found only in sporting goods stores.
   Eclipse's Sosin said Tick Garde works not just because of DEET.
He said DEET's combination with four other active ingredients make
the product the ``best repellent you can buy.''
   But entomologists are skeptical. Hall said DEET remains the
crucial element of any repellent safe for the skin, and he's ``not
aware of any breakthroughs in synergistic chemistry that would
target Lyme disease.''
   There is a more powerful anti-tick protection, based on a
chemical called permethrin, but it's only safe to apply to clothes
and lawns.
   Johnson Wax, estimated to control between 50 percent and 65
percent of the repellent market, credits itself with the foresight
of developing in mid-1988 a campaign targeting Lyme-endemic areas
with special ads.
   Miles Laboratories of Elkhart, Ind., waited until June to launch
radio and print ads in the ``tick belt,'' touting its Cutter
product as ``the most powerful tick repellent you can wear,'' said
vice president Henry Furgal.
   Hall said Lyme-tick hype has created the perception of a
spreading menace, although it ``has been described in the medical
literature for a long period of time, and people have managed to
muddle through pretty well.''
   Other insects have enjoyed similar notoriety. In the 1960s, ``it
suddenly appeared as if the venemous brown recluse spider was
spreading across the U.S. when in fact we were simply recording its
distribution,'' Hall said.
   Entrepreneurs saw opportunity then too. ``There were a lot of
pest control jobs sold to homeowners ostensibly to eliminate
spiders from areas where they were not a problem,'' Hall said.
   He and other experts said the most important invention in the
battle to repel bugs is window screening, which was developed in
1862.

   The stock market eked out a small gain today,
following through on Wednesday's advance after some early
hesitation.
   The Commerce Departmen reported that the index of leading
economic indicators dipped 0.1 percent in June, following a
downward-revised drop of 1.3 percent the month before.
   Analysts had been forecasting a decline of 0.2 percent to 0.3
percent for June. They said the actual figure had little apparent
impact on the market, leaving significant questions unanswered
about the economic outlook.
   The debate continues among market analysts over whether slowing
growth will lead to a relatively benign ``soft landing'' or
something with more severe effects on the pace of business and
corporate profits.

<HEAD>Soviet, Western Scholars Propose Ruble Convertibility Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Making the Soviet ruble into a useful world
currency will require ``far-reaching reforms of the Soviet economic
system,'' according to a report to Moscow by a panel of Soviets and
Westerners.
   The 60-page report released Thursday was sought by Soviet
officials who are searching for ways to bring their rigid,
unproductive economy into the modern world of trade and finance.
   ``I hope that this is something that is to be carefully looked
at. We hope to distribute it widely in the Soviet Union,'' Vladimir
Popov, one of the Soviet participants, said in a telephone
interview.
   The report was released at the Geonomics Institute think tank in
Middlebury, Vt., the meeting place for the panel, which was made up
of scholars from the United States, Canada, France and the Soviet
Union.
   Because the ruble cannot be freely exchanged for dollars, yen,
marks and other Western currencies, it has virtually no value
outside the Soviet Union.
   Making the ruble convertible would permit expanded trade with
the West and impose a market discipline on inefficient Soviet
enterprises, in keeping with the perestroika campaign of Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   It also would encourage more foreign investment in the Soviet
Union, leading to a transfer of technology from the West. Western
business executives favor it because they feel it would open a huge
untapped market for their goods and services.
   The panel proposed a five-step plan for achieving full
convertibility of the ruble, possibly by as early as the year 2000.
   But it noted that ``the obstacles to even a partial
convertibility of the ruble are daunting.'' It could trigger
spiraling inflation, cause shortages, throw people out of work and
exacerbate differences between rich and poor, the panel said.
   Although the Soviet Council of Foreign Ministers last December
ordered up a plan for partial convertibility of the ruble,
beginning with a 50 percent devaluation this coming Jan. 1, many
observers believe the concept could run afoul of internal politics.
   ``I'd say that the odds of a plan that would get the Soviet
Union to meaningful convertibility being adopted are probably
50-50, in the foreseeable future,'' said Josef C. Brada, an Arizona
State University professor who led the Vermont panel.
   As a first step toward convertibility, the panel said hard
Western currencies should be sold to the highest bidding state
enterprise instead of allocated by central planners, as is
currently done. After that, it said, the auction should be
broadened to a wider range of state enterprises.
   In a third phase, cooperatives, private enterprises and
Soviet-Western joint ventures should be allowed to bid for hard
currencies in an open auction, which gradually would turn into a
genuine foreign-exchange market, the panel said.
   Households would be allowed to own foreign currencies in a
fourth phase, although the government could maintain a two-tier
exchange rate. Finally, foreigners would be given the right to
exchange rubles freely.
   The official exchange rate for the ruble is about $1.60, but the
black market rate ranges from 40 cents to as little as 9 cents to
the ruble.
   Making the ruble convertible would destroy the Soviet pricing
system, under which industrial goods and raw materials are cheap
and consumer goods are expensive.
   Entrepreneurs could exploit the discrepancy by selling cheap
Soviet oil to the United States at a huge markup, for example,
using the dollars to buy Japanese tape recorders and selling the
tape recorders in the Soviet Union at another huge markup.
   Such trades would leave Soviets short of oil and quickly put the
Soviet tape recorder factories out of business.
   To prevent that, the panel favors controls on trade that
gradually would be phased out as Soviet pricing came into line with
world pricing.
   Many people have hoards of rubles with nothing to spend them on.
If they were allowed to exchange them for dollars, a giant
reservoir of money would be opened and inflation would soar.
   The Soviet and Western participants disagreed on several points.
Popov said he favored heavy borrowing from the West to ease the
pain of a five- to seven-year transition to a market economy.
Brada, the group leader, said that would lead to a debt crunch like
Poland's.
   Brada said he favored wiping out the existing ruble hoards by
issuing a new ruble, something that Josef Stalin did in 1947. Popov
said such a step would be unpopular and rumors of it would trigger
a run on stores as people spent their soon-to-be-worthless currency.

<HEAD>Hit New Record of $337.03 Billion in Latest Week</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Assets of the nation's 467 money market mutual
funds rose by $4.24 billion in the latest week to an all-time high
of $337.03 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday came despite
declining interest rates, which tend to make money market funds
less attractive than other investments.
   It broke the record set a week earlier, when the assets rose a
revised $1.86 billion to $332.79 billion, said the institute, a
Washington-based mutual fund trade group. That weekly gain
initially was reported as $1.85 billion.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 231
general purpose funds rose $361.5 million to $106.32 billion,
assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $1.18 billion to $143.21
billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds rose $2.71 billion
to $87.50 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.47 percent from 8.60 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.64 percent from 8.73 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
42 days, up from 41 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts fell to 6.45 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.51 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained unchanged at 5.12 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.32
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.47
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.32 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.47 percent; 8.23 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.35
percent; and 8.21 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.33 percent.

   A consumer group said Thursday that government
regulators have been ``negligent and reckless'' in failing to
enforce a law requiring makers of medical devices to report deaths
and injuries associated with their products.
   Public Citizen Health Research Group said its analysis of Food
and Drug Administration documents found that manufacturers of
devices such as heart pacemakers, wheelchairs and breast implants
routinely ignore the reporting requirement and that the FDA has
failed to seek prosecution of the companies.
   ``The FDA has been negligent and reckless in not enforcing this
law,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the health research
group. In addition, ``medical device companies are doing a reckless
and dangerous job in failing to report these deaths, injuries and
malfunctions,'' he said.
   FDA's inaction has meant that hazardous devices remain in use
``causing further needless harm to patients,'' the group said in
letters asking members of Congress to investigate the matter.
   The FDA, through spokesman Jeff Nesbit, said it ``does not agree
with Public Citizen's assessment.'' He said that while many of the
figures the group used are correct ``they have been incorrectly
interpreted as to the actual public health risk.''
   As to the delay Public Citizen cited between the time a company
is alerted to a problem and the FDA issues a reprimand, he said
that when FDA inspectors find a violation they inform the company
of it during the inspection. If the problem warrants a recall, the
FDA advises the company on the spot, he said.
   Reps. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee, and Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the
panel's health subcommittee, cited the Public Citizen study in
announcing Thursday that they have introduced a bill to tighten the
reporting provision of the law.
   In addition to device makers, hospitals and physicians would be
required to report deaths and injuries associated with malfunctions.
   The documents obtained by Public Citizen through the Freedom of
Information Act contained the findings of routine FDA inspections
of medical device manufacturing companies between December 1985 and
June 1988.
   The documents also included letters, called Notice of Adverse
Findings, that the FDA sent to companies failing to report deaths,
injuries and malfunctions.
   Wolfe called the FDA letters a ``slap on the wrist.''
   ``I believe the general attitude at FDA is you treat industry as
your partner, not your adversary,'' Wolfe said.
   The law requires manufacturers of medical devices to report to
the FDA within five days a malfunction that results in death or
serious injury, he said. But the group's review found that an
average of eight months passed from the time the company was
alerted to a problem to its discovery by the FDA.
   Further, the group said, the FDA took an average of six months
to issue a reprimand.
   During the period reviewed, FDA inspectors found reports of at
least seven deaths, 109 serious injuries and 265 malfunctions and
one design defect, none of which had been passed on to the FDA,
Wolfe said.
   Also, 33 companies had failed to report device problems within
the required deadline, he said.
   The group found serious violations relating to 76 products, he
said.
   In one case, four infant deaths and four serious injuries were
associated with alarm failures on an infant respiration and
heart-rate monitor, the group said. In another, two deaths, a
serious injury and 178 malfunctions were linked to use of
intra-aorta balloon catheters, it said.
   Also, 21 serious injuries were associated with a pacemaker, and
at least 31 serious injuries resulted from leaking breast
prostheses, the group said.
   For violations that are shown to be deliberate, the law provides
for a fine of up to $10,000 and three years in prison. Violations
that are not deemed to be deliberate can be punished with a fine of
up to $1,000 and up to a year in prison, said Katherine Meyer, a
lawyer with the group.
   A General Accounting Office report in February said the FDA's
system for handling medical device reports was ``not adequate to
handle the volume of reports currently received.'' It pointed to
long delays in getting information into the system and analyzing
submitted reports.

<HEAD>Feds Say Crooked Soybean Futures Traders Profited From Drought</HEAD>

   Last year's drought devastated many Midwestern
farmers, but the federal government says crooked traders in the
soybean pits of the Chicago Board of Trade reaped illegal profits
from the parched fields.
   As the searing sun dried up soybean fields, concern grew over
how much damage the crop would suffer.
   The potential for profit was high enough for legitimate traders,
because fears of a scarce crop sent the price of futures contracts
skyrocketing. But the government says 19 traders in the chaotic
soybean pit wanted more.
   With orders to buy abundant and orders to sell scarce, the
crooked traders held sell orders off the open market and illegally
passed them to friends who profited, the government alleges.
   ``In those instances, the orders of thousands of other customers
were unfulfilled,'' said U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas.
   Traders later split the ``substantial profits'' realized from
the illegal trades, according to a federal indictment.
   In all, a federal grand jury returned indictments Wednesday
against 46 traders at the Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange alleging they systematically conspired to skim profits
from customer accounts and attempted to hide earnings from the
Internal Revenue Service.
   The indictments, the first stemming from a 2{-year
investigation, offer an insider's view of what the government says
were widespread fraud schemes in four trading pits at the world's
largest futures markets, where deals are made with a flash of a
hand signal and fortunes made or lost in the wink of an eye.
   In more than 700 charges, the government alleges 19 traders in
the frenzied soybean pit ran illegal schemes designed to cover
their losses and increase their profits.
   The indictment uses the colorful language of the trading pits to
describe the alleged scheme: Traders hold ``decks,'' or handfuls of
customer orders; ``bagmen'' are traders who agree to ``bagged,'' or
pre-arranged trades, that are used to cover theft.
   The government said traders used a variety of tactics to run
their scheme, including destroying trading cards and rewriting
cards to conceal illegal trading. The indictment alleged the
traders even kept account ledgers to record money due to and from
one another on illegal deals.
   The methods the government says Martin J. Dempsey used to handle
a losing day last year provide an example of one of the more common
frauds alleged in the indictments.
   Dempsey was charged with racketeering, conspiracy, 37 counts of
mail and wire fraud and 83 counts of violating the Commodities
Exchange Act.
   But on June 28, 1988, Dempsey's troubles amounted to a $70,000
personal trading loss.
   The government said he tried to shift the loss to other traders
and succeeded in laying off $34,000. But his willing accomplice was
undercover FBI Special Agent Richard Ostrom, posing as a crooked
trader.
   The scheme worked like this:
   A broker who wanted to offset personal losses would pre-arrange
trades with an ``accommodating trader'' and later repay the
``accommodating trader'' by misappropriating customer money.
   In Dempsey's case, the government said, he assured Ostrom that
he would repay him by offsetting the loss against previously
converted customer funds as well as through future thefts.

<TEXT>
   Petroleum futures prices declined Thursday with
little news to drive the market forward.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
fell 7 cents to close at $18.21 a barrel after trading as high as
$18.50 during the session. The contract had finished 25 cents
higher on Wednesday. Contracts set for delivery later in the year
also declined.
   Refined oil products traded on the exchange also finished lower.
The September contract for unleaded gasoline closed down 0.19 cent
to 50.66 cents a gallon and heating oil for September delivery fell
0.42 cent to 49.12 cents a gallon.
   Other contract months also closed lower.
   Analysts said nervousness about the U.S. hostage situation in
the Middle East helped buoy prices early in the day. But once the
crisis passed, investor concern about excess oil returned.
   Traders have attributed some price strength in recent days to
investor concern that political events involving the U.S. hostages
could disrupt oil shipments from the Middle East.
   Gasoline and crude oil prices have weakened recently in the face
of slowing demand and growing inventories. Refineries are pumping
at over 90 percent capacity, the highest level in several years.
But high gasoline prices have softened demand.
   ``Fundamentally, there's just too much crude and product out
there,'' said James R. Fiedler, vice president in charge of energy
brokering for E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures Inc.

<HEAD>Coastal Second-Quarter Earnings Up 15 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coastal Corp. said Thursday its second-quarter
earnings, inflated by profits the company reaped from its failed
takeover of Texas Eastern Corp., rose 15 percent from the same
period last year.
   Net income for the three months ending June 30 were $35.3
million, or 58 cents per share, on revenue of $2.1 billion. That
compared to $30.6 million, or 50 cents per share, on $1.86 billion
in revenue in the comparable 1988 quarter.
   The 1989 earnings included a $32 million pretax gain realized
when Coastal tendered its shares of Texas Eastern, which spurned
Coastal's hostile takeover bid and instead agreed to merge with
Panhandle Eastern Corp.
   Coastal's operating profit was $148 million in this year's
quarter, compared to $156 million last year.
   Operating profit for natural gas, Coastal's largest profit
contributor on a segment basis, was $67.4 million for the second
quarter _ a decline from the $104 million posted a year ago.
   For the first six months, profits rose 24 percent to $95.7
million, or $1.58 per share, on revenue of $4.47 billion. Earnings
were $77.1 million, or $1.35 per share, on revenue of $4.22 billion
for the same 1988 period.
   Houston-based Coastal, a diversified energy firm with $8 billion
in assets, has operations in natural gas transmission and storage,
oil and gas exploration and production, refining and marketing,
coal, trucking and independent power production.

   The stock market struggled to a small gain
Thursday, following through on Wednesday's advance after some early
hesitation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 16.32 on Wednesday,
gained another 4.17 to 2,661.61. That pushed the average past its
previous post-crash closing high of 2,660.66, reached on Monday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
874 up, 628 down and 499 unchanged.
   Although the Dow Jones industrial average remains more than 60
points below its 1987 high, the NASDAQ composite index for the
over-the-counter market became the latest of several broader market
measures to hit a record level.
   It rose 2.85 to 456.93, surpassing its reading of 455.26 on Aug.
26, 1987.
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that the index of
leading economic indicators dipped 0.1 percent in June, following a
downward-revised drop of 1.3 percent the month before.
   Analysts had been forecasting a decline of 0.2 percent to 0.3
percent for June. They said the actual figure had little apparent
impact on the market, leaving significant questions unanswered
about the economic outlook.
   The debate continues among market analysts over whether slowing
growth will lead to a relatively benign ``soft landing'' or
something with more severe effects on the pace of business and
corporate profits.
   Analysts said some stronger sentiment might arise Friday after
the Labor Department issues its monthly report on the employment
situation.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 168.69 million
shares, down from 181.76 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 210.44 million shares.
   Walt Disney jumped 6] to 121 in active trading. The company said
this week it will to double the capacity of its new theme park in
Orlando, Fla. The stock has also been buoyed lately by takeover
speculation.
   Elsewhere among the blue chips, International Business Machines
rose 1 to 113}; American Express { to 38\; General Motors 1] to 46,
and Philip Morris 1[ to 163|.
   Ashland Oil rose 1[ to 38|; Nicor gained 1{ to 39}, and Oracle
Systems, traded in the over-the-counter market, was up 1 at 16].
   The three were added to Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite
index, prompting buying by index funds set up to duplicate the
performance of that measure of market trends.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .60 to 393.62, and the
500-stock composite was up .40 at 344.74.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $8.52 billion, or 0.25
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .31 to 192.09. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at a record 376.82, up 1.34.

   The dollar extended its advance Thursday against
most major currencies, bolstered by continued edginess about the
hostage situation in the Middle East.
   Gold prices rose in Europe and the United States after falling
in Asia.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for August delivery
closed at $373.70 a troy ounce, up from Wednesday's settlement of
$370.10. Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $372.25
an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT in New York, up from Wednesday's $369.70.
   Traders said nervousness stemming from the hostage situation
continued to lift the dollar, usually considered a ``safe haven''
currency during episodes of international tension.
   In addition, some market watchers speculated that traders were
talking the dollar up ahead of Friday's release of U.S.
unemployment figures for July. If the figures prove disappointing,
traders will be cushioned from a sharp fall in the dollar by its
already higher levels.
   ``Those two factors have really caused the market to buy back a
good portion of the dollars they sold earlier in the week,'' said
Robert Hatcher, a vice president of foreign exchange at the New
York office of Barclays Bank PLC.
   The market continues to be preoccupied with developments in the
Middle East. Reports of U.S. warships moving to the Middle East
heightened speculation about possible military action in the region
following the reported execution of Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins.
   The Bush administration called Thursday's reprieve in the
threatened execution of hostage Joseph Cicippio ``an encouraging
and hopeful development'' but said it did not fulfill U.S. demands
for the release of all the hostages.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar edged up 0.20 Japanese yen to close at 136.40
yen. Later in London, the dollar traded at 136.40 yen. By the end
of trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 137.20 yen, up
from 136.60 yen late Wednesday.
   The British pound traded in London at $1.6475 Thursday, down
sharply from $1.6635 late Wednesday, even though the Bank of
England entered the market to support the sagging currency. Later,
in New York, sterling stood at $1.6370, cheaper for buyers than
$1.6560 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8715 West German marks, up from
1.8575; 1.6115 Swiss francs, up from 1.5970; 1.1730 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1751; 6.3400 French francs, up from 6.2900;
and 1,348.50 Italian lire, up from 1,334.50.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.8650 West German marks, up from 1.8505; 1.6065 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5915; 6.3192 French francs, up from 6.2695;
2.0950 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0895; 1,338.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,332.00; and 1.1715 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1755.
   Gold was bid at $369.75 a troy ounce, up from $368.25 late
Wednesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold was little changed in
moribund trading after a two-day national holiday. The closing
price was $369.00 a troy ounce, up from Monday's close of $368.25.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 40 cents an ounce to close at
$370.05.
   Silver traded at $5.23 a troy ounce in London, down from $5.27
an ounce late Wednesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery rose to $5.296 a troy ounce from Wednesday's
settlement of $5.225.

   Avon Products Inc.'s directors on Thursday
spurned investor Irwin L. Jacobs' $2.85 billion takeover proposal
and reiterated their belief that the cosmetics giant should remain
independent.
   The move, the latest in a string of rejections the direct sales
company has doled out to unwanted suitors, had been expected.
   But speaking from his headquarters in Minneapolis, Jacobs said
he would take Avon Chairman and Chief Executive James E. Preston up
on an offer to meet and discuss Avon's ``business plans.''
   Preston said in a letter to Jacobs that he would be willing to
meet with the investor _ as he would with any major shareholder _
but ``not to negotiate a sale of the company.'' An Avon spokesman
also noted that Jacobs would not be allowed to meet with the entire
board.
   ``We are going to take the high road in this thing,'' Jacobs
said in a telephone interview. ``I will very happily meet with him,
which is more than others have gotten to do.''
   Jacobs said he thought a meeting could be held within the week.
   Preston officially responded to Jacobs' offer by letter but
phoned the investor before the letter was released. Jacobs
described the call as ``very friendly and amicable and one that I
was pleased to get, and yet I wished the results were a little
better.''
   On Wall Street, Avon stock slid 62{ cents a share to $35.87{ in
consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, indicating dealers
were skeptical of Jacobs' $41-a-share offer.
   On Wednesday, Jacobs tried the solo approach with Avon
directors, who less than two months ago rejected a bid engineered
by Jacobs's partner and Avon's rival direct sales company, Amway
Corp.
   In his brief letter to Jacobs, Preston said the board
``thoroughly'' reviewed the proposal with its investment banker,
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., at a regularly scheduled board meeting.
   ``The board unanimously rejected your proposal,'' Preston said.
``The board believes that the best interests of the shareholders
would be served by Avon remaining an independent company and being
allowed to execute its business plan.''
   Through a partnership with Jacobs, Amway controls about 10.3
percent of Avon's common stock; Jacobs controls about 55 percent of
the Avon stock owned by the alliance, known as A-J Partnership.
   In May, the Avon board rejected Amway's hostile $39-a-share
takeover bid and indicated it would resist future acquisition
attempts. Days later, Avon also rebuffed overtures from Mary Kay
Corp., parent of the door-to-door makeup seller Mary Kay Cosmetics
Inc.
   In addition to paying $2.25 billion for Avon's 54.91 million
common outstanding shares, Jacobs also said he might redeem Avon's
preferred shares at $33.50 each, or a total of about $603 million,
raising the price tag on Avon to roughly $2.85 billion.

   Soybean futures plunged to a 20-month low Thursday on selling

liquidation of a large holding by Italian grain merchant Ferruzzi
Finanziaria S.p.A.
   On other markets, precious metals rallied strongly, energy
futures were lower; cattle were mostly higher and pork futures were
mixed.
   At the Chicago Board of Trade, soybeans for delivery in August
settled 26 cents lower at $5.82\ a bushel, the lowest settlement
for a near-month soybean contract since Nov. 19, 1987.
   Wheat settled 1} cents to 6 cents lower with September at $3.87
a bushel; corn was 4\ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with September
at $2.17\ a bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 3 cents higher with
September at $1.35} a bushel.
   Forecasts for a continuation of near-perfect growing conditions
in the Midwest provided a bearish atmosphere for the soybean
market. But traders and analysts said the steep decline probably
was triggered by signs of weak demand and selling by Ferruzzi, a
leading European grain dealer that has had a large holding in
soybean futures.
   The slack market for soybeans and soybean meal also reflected a
reluctance among users to make large purchases ahead of the
September harvest period, when new supplies typically drive prices
down.
   Analyst Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said cash
soybean meal prices had dropped $2 to $4 a ton on Wednesday and the
futures market reacted from the opening bell.
   The sharp drop in August soybean prices occurred near the close
on heavy selling by Central Soya Co. and Refco Inc., thought to be
on behalf of Ferruzzi, which owns Central Soya.
   ``I think the trade suspects that, yes,'' said analyst Dale
Gustafson of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in Chicago a.
   One soybean trader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was
more certain.
   ``It was Ferruzzi that sold,'' he said. ``That pressured most of
the beans and meal and down we went.''
   Central Soya President David Swanson said the company was an
``aggressive'' buyer in the cash market but declined to comment on
futures market activities.
   Heavy selling by Ferruzzi would suggest the company is
liquidating its position in the August contract, possibly because
of the increased availability of supplies on the cash market.
   Earlier in the day, the Board of Trade announced that Ferruzzi
had dropped a lawsuit against the exchange challenging its July 11
order requiring traders to reduce their holdings in the July
soybean contract.
   The exchange's order was widely perceived as a move to prevent
Ferruzzi from cornering the U.S. soybean market.
   A federal judge had denied Ferruzzi's request for an injunction
on July 13 and the July soybean contract expired on July 20,
rendering the lawsuit moot.
   Ferruzzi was believed to have complied with the order by
shifting its huge market position from the July contract into the
August contract, raising the potential for another confrontation
before the contract's Aug. 22 expiration.
   Gold and silver futures posted strong gains on New York's
Commodity Exchange, despite a rise in the dollar's value against
other major currencies. Precious metals and markets usually move in
the opposite direction.
   The unusual behavior of gold and silver indicated the market was
reacting to the political tensions stemming from the threat to U.S.
hostages in Lebanon, said Jack Barbanel, director of futures
trading for Gruntal &amp; Co. in New York.
   Gold settled $3.50 to $3.70 higher with August at $373.70 a troy
ounce; silver was 7 cents to 7.2 cents higher with August at $5.296
a troy ounce.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 12 cents
lower with September at $18.21 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent
to .48 cent lower with September at 49.12 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .16 cent to .32 cent lower with September at 50.66
cents a gallon.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle settled
unchanged to .25 cent higher with August at 73.55 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent higher with August at 84.07
cents a pound; hogs were unchanged to .55 cent higher with August
at 46.52 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.05 cents lower
to .28 cent higher with August at 26.20 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hundred-page indictments the government
dumped on the commodities world may have created an initial
spectacular splash and could signal more charges to come, but
defense lawyers and other experts see weakness behind all that
paper.
   ``I've been doing this for 25 years, and nobody's ever written
this much,'' attorney Ed Genson said Wednesday, hefting the legal
documents that federal prosecutors produced several hours earlier
in indicting 46 traders at the world's two largest futures
exchanges.
   ``And if it takes that long to explain what they did wrong,'' he
added, ``then my position is that they haven't done much wrong.''
   Genson has two clients indicted in the first wave, but another
two dozen have retained his services because they expect to be
indicted. His skepticism about the charges is shared by others.
   ``What is being alleged is serious from the point of view of
rule-breaking at the exchanges. But as far as massive amounts of
money being stolen from customers _ that just hasn't been shown
yet,'' said Daniel Siegel, a futures market specialist and
assistant professor of finance at Northwestern University.
   ``People knew what was coming when the investigation was first
revealed,'' he added, ``and quite frankly, I don't think people
will stop using these markets as a result.''
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the charges were part
of ``a crackdown on white-collar crime in all its various guises,
from Wall Street to (Chicago's) LaSalle Street to Main Street and
all stops in between.''
   Prosecutors charge that a variety of illegal schemes took place
at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
during the 2{-year undercover investigation, all to the detriment
of customers.
   Thornburgh's presence at the news conference announcing the
indictments _ which ranged from mail and wire fraud to racketeering
for allegedly bilking profits from hundreds of customers _ lent a
certain weight to the proceedings.
   But Anton Valukas, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of
Illinois, sais the alleged activity involved hundreds of customers
and thousands of trades, but he declined to place a dollar amount
on the fraud other than to say it was significant.
   Defense attorneys and traders suggested a deeper look into the
indictments themselves reveal few significant abuses actually took
place.
   They acknowledged that a handful of traders likely made large
profits through illegal trades, but also hinted that motives other
than a serious desire to fight crime may have driven some the
investigation.
   Just hours after the indictments were announced, a House
committee approved legislation reauthorizing the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates the commodity
futures exchanges.
   The legislation, approved by the Agriculture Committee, would
grant permanent regulatory authority to the CFTC, which Congress
has reauthorized on a temporary basis every three or four years
since the agency was created in 1974.
   The measure, which now goes to the full House, also would impose
restrictions on trading practices such as dual trading that have
come under criticism following disclosure of the commodities probe.
   ``There are a few practices that they want to choke out of the
markets,'' said one trader who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
``and nobody _ the exchanges or the regulators _ has the guts to do
it.''
   Among the market practices the trader identified were the
``open-outcry'' system and dual trading, both of which lend
themselves to abuse by dishonest traders.
   Under open-outcry, traders shout orders and wave hand signals to
each other in the free-for-all auction of contracts. Dual trading
allows a client to trade for his own account as well as his
customers'.
   ``I'm not sure there was an ulterior motive, but the
prosecutorial mentality assumes that if a person can do something,
immoral or illegal, they will,'' said Genson.
   Siegel, like several defense attorneys interviewed Wednesday,
predicted a second wave of indictments would follow as more traders
at the CBOT and Merc are persuaded to cooperate with the government.
   But unlike most of the defense attorneys, he found something to
be encouraged about.
   ``I doubt if getting rid of the open-outcry system is what the
feds had in mind with the indictments, but people have been
complaining about it for a long time,'' he said.
   ``What this might do is enable the exchanges to overcome the
resistance out there and quiet the cries about accountability by
moving to electronic trading. That is the big battle just over the
horizon, the fight to be the pre-eminent futures market and the
international competition is ferocious,'' he said.

<HEAD>Burger King Picks Texas Firm as its Hispanic Ad Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burger King Corp. said Thursday it has selected
the Texas-based agency Sosa &amp; Associates to handle promotions and
advertising directed at the Hispanic market.
   The nation's second-largest fast-food chain behind McDonald's
Corp. has been looking for a new Hispanic ads agency for about a
month.
   Niether the agency nor Burger King would disclose how much the
Miami-based restaurant company plans to spend on the Hispanic
market.
   In another development, Sosa disclosed Thursday that it had
agreed in principle to sell a 49 percent stake to D'Arcy Masius
Benton &amp; Bowles USA, a New York-based agency recently hired as one
of Burger King's main ad agencies.
   A Burger King spokeswoman said the Sosa-D'Arcy deal ``was not a
major swing factor'' in the selection of Sosa for Burger King's
Hispanic account.
   Sosa, based in San Antonio, Texas, is one of the nation's
largest Hispanic ad agencies, handling billings of $40 million and
counting among its clients companies such as Coca-Cola Co.,
Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc. and GTE Corp.
   On Wednesday, Coca-Cola unveiled the first of a series of ads
from Sosa that it plans to run through 1992 saluting Hispanic
contributions to America.
   At Burger King, Sosa succeeds the New York-based ad agency
Castor, which resigned last month after three years as Burger
King's Hispanic ad agency.
   Gary L. Langstaff, Burger King's executive vice president of
marketing, said Sosa was selected because of its ``keen sensitivity
to the various elements of the Hispanic market.''
   He said in the statement that Sosa's partnership with D'Arcy
``will greatly enhance our determination to deliver excellence and
sustainability to our integrated marketing strategy.''
   Sosa's job will be to create mostly Spanish-language ads and
promotions for Burger King, according to agency president Lionel
Sosa.
   The 8{-year-old agency was one of about a half-dozen agencies
considered for the job, Burger King officials said.
   Lionel Sosa said the agency will resign its assignment as the
Hispanic ad agency for Domino's Pizza to avoid a potential conflict.
   Burger King has been reviewing its advertising agencies in the
wake of the acquisition of its parent company, Pillsbury Co., by
the British-based Grand Metropolitan PLC earlier this year.
   In May, Burger King said it would divide its main $215 million
advertising assignment between D'Arcy and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising, based in New York.
   On the matter of the sale of a stake in the Sosa agency, Lionel
Sosa said ``a number of different ad agencies have approached us
over the years.''
   But he said D'Arcy offered ``the best chemistry of creative
approach and opportuntity in terms of serving our clients and
theirs.''
   He said the talks with D'Arcy lasted about a year and grew more
serious after D'Arcy won the Burger King assignment.
   Sosa said he figures Burger King viewed his agency's affiliation
with D'Arcy as ``a big bonus.''
   Clayton Wilhite, president of D'Arcy, said the agency made the
investment in Sosa both out of recognition that advertisers are
turning to Hispanic agencies for advertising directed at that
market and to improve profit margins.
   He said D'Arcy handles billings of about $1.8 billion a year.

<HEAD>Sink in Spite of Government Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Long-term bond prices sank Thursday, driving
yields higher, even though a government report added to signs that
the economy might be slipping into a mild recession.
   A recession would be good for the bond market because it would
help squelch inflation, which erodes the value of interest-paying
securities.
   The Commerce Department said its Index of Leading Economic
Indicators edged down 0.1 percent in June. It was the fourth
decline in five months and renewed speculation that the longest
peacetime economic expansion may be at an end.
   Bond prices fluttered slightly higher after the figures were
released but sank later and ended with a substantial loss.
   The U.S. Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 21-32 point, or
about $6.56 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from price, rose to 7.90 percent from 7.84
percent late Wednesday.
   Shorter-term bonds had smaller declines. The 30-year bond was
the biggest loser, evidently because of a threat by President Bush
to veto a savings and loan bailout in favor of his own plan.
   Bush's plan would bring a huge supply of long-term bonds from a
new agency onto the market to finance the savings and loan debt,
depressing prices. Many bond investors had speculated that Bush
would yield to Congress's plan, in which the money would be raised
with bonds of all maturities instead of just long-term ones.
   For the bond market, the threatened veto ``was the straw that
broke the camel's back,'' said Ward McCarthy of Stone &amp; McCarthy
Research Associates Inc.
   Also hurting bond prices was general nervousness that the
market's recent rally was overextended. Some traders saw unwelcome
signs of economic health in figures this week on auto sales, chain
store sales and new home sales.
   ``The market had run an awful long way in this rally and it was
beginning to get some cold feet,'' said William Griggs, a principal
in Griggs &amp; Santow Inc.
   Some traders were mildly concerned by the weakness in the
dollar. If the dollar continues to fall it could limit the Federal
Reserve's willingness to lower interest rates for fear of weakening
the dollar even more, said Hugh A. Johnson, a senior vice president
at First Albany Corp.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were down between 3-32 point and 3-16 point,
intermediate maturities fell [ point to 7-32 point and long-term
issues were | point to 11-16 point lower, the Telerate Inc.
financial-information service reported.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 4.49 to 1,200.80.
   Moody's Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures
total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities
of five years or longer, fell 0.30 to 335.30.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 3-32 point. The average yield to
maturity, because of rounding, remained at 7.16 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.88 percent as the
discount fell 2 basis points to 7.63 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 7.82 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to
7.43 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 7.68 percent as the
discount rose 1 basis point to 7.17 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 8~ percent, unchanged from late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
fell in the week ended July 24, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell $1.5 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,121.2 billion from $3,122.7 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell $4.6 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $4,004.3 billion from $4,008.9 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell $1.3 billion
to a seasonally adjusted $776.2 billion from $777.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed has set a growth target for M2 of 3 percent to 7
percent, while the annual growth target range for M3 is 3.5 percent
to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,090.3 billion, a 1.9

<HEAD>Justice Opens Antitrust Investigation of California Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department said Thursday it has
opened an antitrust investigation of oil prices in California, the
subject of a long-running lawsuit there.
   The state and the city of Long Beach charged in their suit
against six companies that the companies held down prices they paid
for heavy crude oil while secretly agreeing to exchange oil among
themselves at higher prices.
   The companies had agreed to pay the city and the state the
highest price for oil from their wells that they paid anyone else
for oil.
   In their 1985 complaint, the plaintiffs charged that a
conspiracy among the companies cost them $789 million from 1971
through 1977 and from 1980 through 1985.
   The six companies are Chevron, Texaco, Union, Mobil, Shell and
Exxon. A seventh, Arco, paid $22.5 million to settle in 1984.
   A federal appeals court in San Francisco reinstated the lawsuit
in April. It had been dismissed by a lower-court judge in Los
Angeles.
   Assistant Attorney General James F. Rill said in a statement
that ``the antitrust division is looking at crude oil pricing in
the state of California.''
   ``We are monitoring this situation and related developments in
the litigation that was initiated by the state of California and
the city of Long Beach,'' Rill said.

<HEAD>Home Shopping Gambled And Lost Big With GTE Suit, Analysts Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Home Shopping Network Inc. gambled and
lost big in its lawsuit claiming GTE Corp. supplied it with an
inadequate phone system, a setback that only adds to the video
retailer's problems, industry analysts say.
   A jury Wednesday rejected HSN's $1.5 billion suit, instead
awarding two GTE subsidiaries $50 million each in a libel and
slander countersuit.
   ``This really puts Home Shopping Network behind the
eight-ball,'' said William Block, an analyst at Newhard Cook &amp; Co.
in New York. ``At one time, they were really soaring.''
   Home Shopping, which replaced the GTE phones with an MCI system,
reported a profit of $7 million on sales of $586.9 million for the
nine-month period ended May 31. HSN's stock has plummetted from the
mid-40s in 1987 to less than $4 a share.
   In its September 1987 suit, HSN claimed it lost millions of
calls from viewers of its cable TV show and $500 million in
potential sales in 1986 and early 1987 because GTE telephone
equipment it contracted for could not handle the volume of calls.
   During a six-week trial in Pinellas County, the jury rejected
charges of fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and
confidence, and breach of fiduciary duty against GTE.
   The panel instead agreed with GTE's countersuit, maintaining
that the electronic retailer's financial problems were actually the
result of bungled management. GTE argued that over-expansion,
competition and customer dissatisfaction, rather than insufficient
equipment, caused HSN's losses.
   Analysts said the victory mattered more to HSN than to the
communications giant.
   ``GTE is such a huge company that this is seen as just a
one-time gain with little long-range implications,'' said James
Stork of Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``But most investors are
just glad it's over. When something like this goes to a jury, there
is no telling what could happen.''
   ``There's definitely a sigh of relief,'' said Greg Sigmund, an
analyst at A.G. Edwards Inc. in St. Louis. ``No one was really
expecting an adverse decision for GTE, but it was on the back of
the minds of a lot of people.''
   GTE Florida and GTE Communications received awards for damages
to their reputations and credibility by Home Shopping Network and
its two top executives.
   ``The jury heard a lengthy and complex presentation of technical
issues, and it understood that the GTE companies had provided
quality service and equipment to help a small company grow very
quickly into a major business,'' said James C. Carideo, GTE Florida
vice president and general counsel.
   HSN was cited for $20 million of the total award, with $40
million each levied against HSN Chairman Roy Speer and President
Lowell Paxson.
   HSN said it would appeal.
   Nando DiFilippo, HSN's executive vice president and general
counsel, said the company would claim the court should not have
presented GTE's libel and slander counterclaim to the jury.
   Under HSN's format, viewers can only buy HSN merchandise as long
as the item is displayed on the screen. The network said it lost 42
million calls when up to half of its incoming calls never reached
sales operators because of the allegedly faulty equipment.

<HEAD>Citibank President Says Mexican Concessions Won't Be Repeated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citibank president John Reed said
Thursday that concessions made by creditor banks in a recent accord
with Mexico won't be repeated for other debtor countries.
   Speaking before the local Chilean-American Chamber of Commerce
breakfast, Reed, who runs the biggest U.S. bank, also said he
strongly opposed the notion of government control of the foreign
debt problem and observed that the world banking community's
attention has shifted away from the Third World.
   Reed is on a tour of several Latin American countries, including
Venezuela, which is seeking a refinancing of its debt.
   He said he has been asked if other countries will get the same
kind of relief that Mexico received, which included a 35 percent
reduction in its obligations and $2.3 billion in fresh credit.
   ``It was a plan especially for Mexico,'' he said. ``Personally,
I don't believe there will be another of this type. Really, there
won't be another.''
   ``There are certain things that were done in that case which I
don't think the banks will do again. We have learned that they are
very difficult transactions,'' Reed said.
   He said the accord required abandoning about $15 billion in
claims by creditor banks, ``and that comes directly from the banks'
shareholders.'' About 30 percent of the loss in earnings was
absorbed by U.S. banks and the rest by European and Japanese banks,
he said.
   Reed argued that the banking community was much better equipped
than governments to deal with the Third World's foreign debt
problems, and said he strongly opposed a so-called political
solution.
   He said the leading industrialized democracies often have
discussed the debt problem but ``they never come out and say,
`Okay, we're going to take our government resources and resolve the
problem.' ''
   Reed said U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan for
easing the debt problem relies on the banks, and not on public
coffers, for fresh credit.
   ``It's better that we, in the private sector, try to resolve
these problems exchanging debt for investment, extending credits
for the long term, giving time.''

<HEAD>Repatriated Capital Boosts Foreign Reserves to $6 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAM ROSSIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High interest rates have lured $2.3
billion home from foreign banks, boosting the nation's foreign
reserves to $6 billion, the head of Mexico's national bank said
Thursday.
   The first half of 1989 saw an ``abundant repatriation, lured by
high interest rates,'' Banco de Mexico general director Miguel
Mancera said.
   He spoke at the fifth National Banking Meeting, the most
important financial meeting of the year in Mexico.
   Mexicans are estimated to have $28 billion stashed in foreign
banks, mostly in the United States. Much of the money fled because
of the economic crisis that began in 1982 with the worldwide drop
in oil prices.
   Mancera said Mexico's balance of payments showed a $585 million
deficit through July. He called it ``relatively modest considering
the circumstances.''
   Mexico paid out $600 million to service its public debt and $700
million on private debt service, he said. During the same period,
Mancera said, net foreign direct investment was about $900 million.
   The banking meeting in this northern industrial capital of 3
million came in the aftermath of a July 23 accord between Mexico
and private foreign creditors to restructure $54 billion of
Mexico's $107 billion foreign debt.
   ``The agreement doesn't constitute a magic solution to our
problems,'' Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe told the
standing-room-only crowd of banking and government officials from
Mexico, the United States and other countries.
   About 1,500 people are attending the two-day banking meeting at
Monterrey's City Theater.
   ``The current agreement won't permit us to recover overnight
what the crisis of over-indebteness took from us over several
years,'' Aspe said.
   Private analysists have said the debt accord should bring
substantially lower interest rates by generating more confidence in
the national economy.
   With inflation down, the threat of an abrupt currency
devaluation off, and the debt accord signed, the federal government
can begin to tackle its huge internal debt, estimated at $48
billion.

<HEAD>Eastern Machinists Leader Starting Investment Fund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Machinists union leader Charles Bryan marked the
start of the fifth month of the Eastern Airlines strike Thursday by
pledging $100,000 of his own money to a new effort to help the
union-backed buyout bid of Chicago businessman Joseph Ritchie.
   Bryan said he was urging Eastern employees who could afford it,
along with people across the country who support the strikers, to
contribute to an investment fund he hopes will add $50 million to
the Ritchie effort. Bryan, who made the announcement at a news
conference, declined to identify the investment house that is
establishing the fund and said legal details were still being
worked out.
   In a separate development Thursday, the master executive council
of Eastern's pilots union unanimously passed a resolution asking
pilots at carriers nationwide to initiate a suspension of air
service. The parking of planes on runways would be aimed at putting
pressure on Congress to investigate the fitness of Eastern owner
Frank Lorenzo to run Eastern and its sister carrier, Continental
Airlines.
   Bryan said there's enough money already behind the Ritchie bid,
which has been scoffed at by Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. and
received coolly by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. The court
has been overseeing Eastern since it filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization on March 9, five days after being hit by
the crippling strike.
   Ritchie has offered $50 million and the unions have kicked in
another $50 million as well as wage concessions totaling $210
million. In addition, the unions have pledged up to $175 million
from their wages if certain goals aren't met during the first six
months of operation under joint ownership.
   Bryan said the AFL-CIO also is willing to offer a line of credit
ranging from $65 million to $200 million for the bid.
   Texas Air has indicated it wants $100 million to $200 million in
cash up front from any buyer for Eastern.
   ``We are not doing this because we need the money,'' Bryan said,
referring to the new investment fund. He said the effort was meant
to counter Eastern ``misinformation'' about its ability to rebuild
without the unions and also to show the commitment of Eastern's
employees to the airline.
   ``I'm making it because I know it will work,'' Bryan said,
saying that in 33 years at Eastern he has accumulated that money
through an austere lifestyle but is willing to put it into buying
the airline.
   He said money for the fund would be returned if the buyout bid
never comes to fruition. Most of Eastern's striking employees have
no money left for such a fund, Bryan agreed, but he said all
employees would benefit because the investment funds would reduce
the amount of wage concessions they would have to make in the
purchase from Texas Air.
   Eastern pilots union spokesman Ron Cole said he thought the fund
was a good chance ``for people to put their money where their mouth
is and show their commitment to Eastern's employees.''
   Eastern on Aug. 1 increased its schedule to 350 daily flights
and says it will be back to 800 daily flights and out of bankruptcy
by year's end.
   Bryan said Eastern is ``in desperate straits,'' losing money on
each flight because of sharply discounted fares and that it lacks
pilots, mechanics and spare parts for its planes.
   Eastern officials said Bryan's announcement wouldn't change
anything.
   ``Our position has not changed. The airline is not for sale,''
said spokesman Robin Matell.

   Help wanted advertising declined in June for the

said Thursday.
   Its Help Wanted Advertising Index fell 6 points to 148 after
falling in April and May by similar amounts. The index, calculated
on the volume of employment advertising in 51 major newspapers,
uses 1967 as a base year of 100.
   ``Employment growth has slowed, especially in the cyclically
sensitive durable-goods industries,'' Conference Board economist
Ken Goldstein said in a press release.
   Ad volume fell in all regions of the country except the region
comprising parts of Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma, the index
results showed.
   The Conference Board, based in New York, is a leading business
information and research concern.

<HEAD>American Express Exec Plans to Retire Over Safra Matter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top American Express Co. executive said
Thursday he plans to retire because of ``mistakes made on my
watch'' that led the company to issue an unusual public apology to
international banker Edmund J. Safra.
   The financial services giant said that Harry L. Freeman, 57,
advised Chairman James D. Robinson III that he planned to retire as
executive vice president of corporate affairs and communications by
year's end.
   Freeman would be the first American Express employee to leave
his job as a result of the company's admission that people acting
on its behalf had been involved in a campaign to discredit Safra.
   In a letter released by American Express, Freeman told Robinson
he was convinced that the company's ongoing review of the matter
will show he performed his duties ``faithfully and honestly.''
   ``However, a well-intentioned effort for which I had executive
responsibility went awry,'' he wrote. ``Mistakes were made on my
watch, and accordingly I believe my decision to retire while
painful is appropriate.''
   Freeman, a 14-year veteran of American Express, was unavailable
to comment on the letter and was said to be en route to joining his
family for a long-planned vacation to Africa. He was expected back
at work Aug. 21.
   People familiar with the matter said Freeman felt responsibility
for allowing an operation designed to collect information about
Safra, who at one time managed a bank for American Express, to get
out of control.
   After Safra left the American Express operation in 1984, he
turned his attention to his other holding, Republic New York Corp.
and its Republic National Bank.
   But American Express collected information on Safra because
Republic had an agreement not to compete with the American Express
bank in the lucrative Swiss banking market until 1988 and wanted
the pact enforced.
   Last Friday, Robinson apologized publicly to Safra, who lives in
Geneva, for ``an unauthorized and shameful effort by people acting
on American Express' behalf in fueling false media reports that
linked Safra's banks to money laundering.
   American Express also agreed to pay $8 million to charities of
Safra's choice to settle the dispute.
   Robinson told American Express employees in a memo Thursday of
his ``deep regret'' that Freeman intended to retire.
   ``Harry is much loved throughout our organization, and like
others, I will miss his wisdom and his great sense of humor,''
Robinson wrote. ``I wish him the best in future endeavors and look
forward to his counsel as a loyal American Express alumnus.''

<HEAD>Texas Lawyer Settles Insider Trading Charges With SEC</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former top labor lawyer for Burlington
Northern Railroad has agreed to settle fraud and insider trading
charges, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced Thursday.
   But the SEC said it isn't finished looking at the trading of
Burlington Northern Inc. stock, even after the settlement by lawyer
Richard Schreiber.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Schreiber agreed to pay
$23,889 in alleged illegal profits as well as an equal amount in
fines.
   According to a complaint filed at federal court in Fort Worth,
Texas, Schreiber allegedly traded on confidential information in
1988 about the then-pending restructuring of Burlington Northern,
the parent company of the nation's largest railroad.
   But Herbert Janick III, an SEC lawyer in Washington, said the
investigation was continuing because ``there's been other trading
in Burlington Northern that requires scrutiny by us.''
   ``This was a classic insider case,'' said Janick, ``a lawyer
working for the company in question.''
   Theodore Levine, a Washington-based lawyer for Schreiber, said
his client, now an attorney in private practice, ``wanted to settle
to avoid protracted litigation.''
   Levine would not disclose where Schreiber, formerly of
Arlington, Texas, lives.
   According to the complaint, Schreiber learned about a possible
Burlington Northern restructuring in March 1988 from a senior vice
president who was consulting him about possible labor problems that
might arise from the move.
   The SEC charged that Schreiber bought Burlington Northern common
stock on March 31, 1988, and after further discussions with company
officials about the restructuring, the lawyer allegedly bought 60
Burlington Northern June call options at $1 per contract.
   A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a particular
stock at a predetermined price by a certain date in exchange for a
premium. As a strategy, call options allow investors who believe a
stock will rise dramatically to profit from a small stake.
   After Burlington Northern announced the restructuring June 2,
1988, the SEC charged, Schreiber sold his positions and made
$23,889 in alleged illegal profits.
   The company spun off its natural resources division into a
separate company called Burlington Resources.

<HEAD>Newmont Cancels Planned Recapitalization of Peabody</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing the impacts of the continuing coal industry
strike and the uncertain impact of new acid rain legislation,
Newmont Mining Corp. on Thursday canceled plans for a
recapitalization of Peabody Holding Company Inc., in which it holds
a stake.
   The recapitalization plan did not have the ``flexibility to
accommodate the possible negative implications of those two recent
events,'' said Newmont Chairman Gordon R. Parker.
   Denver-based Newmont had announced plans for a transaction that
would have yielded a $425 million pre-tax dividend from Peabody to
Newmont together with a $75 million payment to Newmont from new
Peabody investors, while allowing Newmont to retain its current
equity in Peabody.
   Newmont said it planned to use the cash to cut its debt.
   The other current shareholders of Peabody were simultaneously to
surrender their entire interest in a redemption by Peabody. Salomon
Brothers Inc. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. would have become
shareholders in their place under the plan.
   The decision to halt the plan, which called for a $1 million
redemption option payment Thursday to the current holders of 50.03
percent of Peabody's shares, was based on the strike and President
Bush's announcement of plans to cut acid rain emissions, the
company said.
   ``As originally conceived, the recapitalization, including the
redemption price and the dividend level, were sound, and Salomon
and Shearson were prepared to give Newmont the right in the
mid-1990's to become the sole owner of Peabody, if Newmont so
chose,'' Parker said.
   ``The strike that began in June at Pittston and spread to much
of the rest of the coal industry, and the potential impact on the
entire coal industry of the administration's newly proposed acid
rain legislation, have made the redemption price under the option
from our co-shareholders in Peabody potentially uneconomic to
Peabody,'' he said.
   ``We do not wish to compromise our ongoing 49.97 percent
investment in Peabody...,'' he said.

<HEAD>Media Investor Agrees To Buy Stake in Publisher of Ms., Sassy Magazines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Magazine entrepreneur Dale W. Lang has agreed in
principle to become a joint owner of the company that publishes Ms.
and Sassy magazines, it was announced Thursday.
   Executives at Matilda Publications Inc. have been looking for an
infusion of capital for the publishing concern for several months.
   Lang agreed to invest an undisclosed amount of money to assume
joint ownership of Matilda Publications with Citicorp's Venture
Capital Fund, which arranged financing for a management-led buyout
of the magazines last summer.
   As part of the deal, Lang said in a statement he would take over
management of both magazines, possibly as early as the October
issues.
   Ms., which was founded by the feminist Gloria Steinem and others
in 1972, has a circulation of 550,000, Lang said. Sassy, launched
in March 1988, is a magazine for teenage girls and has a
circulation of 450,000.
   Anne Summers, editor-in-chief at both magazines, said she and
the other Matilda founders knew when the company was formed in July
1988 that more capital would be needed eventually.
   ``The magazines are healthy. Their circulation is very good and
although neither of them is profitbale, we are looking for them to
move into profitability within the next year or so,'' she said.
   Lang has been involved since 1987 in a joint venture with Time
Inc. called Working Woman-McCall's Group.
   That partnership published McCall's, Working Woman and Working
Mother magazines, and it recently sold McCall's, a women's service
magazine, to New York Times Co. for what insiders estimate was
about $80 million.
   Lang said plans are underway for him to buy Time's 50 percent
stake in Working Woman and Working Mother.
   He said that once that purchase is completed, he hopes to place
those magazines with his interests in Ms. and Sassy under a new
corporate unbrella called Lang Communications Inc.
   ``Our new company intends to bring together a strong stable of
well-focused, editorially-driven, high-demographic magazines,'' he
said.
   Working Woman, which Lang says has a circulation of 950,000,
focuses on business management for career women. Working Mother,
with a circulation of 625,000, is a lifestyle magazine devoted to
helping the working mother balance family and career
responsibilities.
   Lang also owns Success magazine, which is aimed at entrepreneurs
and has a circulation of 450,000.

<HEAD>Hanson Shareholders Approve Offer For Consolidated Gold Fields</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Hanson PLC at a meeting in London
Thursday approved the British conglomerate's 3.5 billion pound, or
$5.7 billion, offer for the mining giant Consolidated Gold Fields
PLC, Hanson said.
   Approval was expressed in an overwhelming show of hands among
those present. Shareholders voting by proxy also were
overwhelmingly in favor of the offer, said Hanson, Britain's
fourth-largest company.
   On June 22, Hanson, in a move that took the stock market by
surprise, offered 3.1 billion pounds, then worth $4.8 billion, for
Consolidated Gold Fields.
   Consolidated Gold Fields accepted Hanson's bid in early July.
Under the agreement, Hanson said it would offer 14.30 pounds, or
the equivalent of $23.45 a share, for Consolidated and give
Consolidated shareholders warrants to purchase new Hanson shares.
   Also under the agreement, Consolidated agreed to pay
shareholders the equivalent of a 65-cent dividend for the fiscal
year ended June 30. The warrant and dividend together increased the
value of Hanson's offer to $25.09 a share.
   Consolidated has interests in South African gold and platinum
and U.S. construction materials.
   Hanson has interests ranging from bricks and EverReady batteries
to light industry.
   In April, a U.S. court blocked a merger bid for Consolidated
from South African-controlled Minorco SA, an investment group.
Minorco's bid was valued at 3.65 billion pounds, then worth $6.2
billion.
   A majority of Consolidated shareholders indicated that they
wanted to accept Minorco's bid. But the U.S. court refused to lift
an injunction against a Minorco takeover arising from an antitrust
suit.
   U.S. courts had ruled that Minorco had ambitions to create a
world gold monopoly.

   Southern Pacific Transportation Co. will
pay $22 million in cash to purchase the St. Louis to Chicago rail
line of the Chicago, Missouri &amp; Western Railway Co., officials
announced Thursday.
   The CM&amp;W railway submitted the preliminary sale agreement to
Chief Bankruptcy Judge John D. Schwartz in Chicago, said Daniel R.
Murray, trustee of CM&amp;W.
   Southern Pacific, a unit of Rio Grande Industries Inc., agreed
to buy the 282-mile line through Springfield and Bloomington, Ill.,
and to assume $7 million in debt owed by CM&amp;W to the state of
Illinois, he said. CM&amp;W is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Under the terms of the agreement, the trustee would retain the
CM&amp;W lines from Kansas City, Mo., to Springfield and to Godfrey,
Ill., as well as a 50 percent interest in the lines from eastern
St. Louis to Godfery. The St. Louis and Kansas City lines meet in
Godfrey.
   Schwartz referred the matter to the Interstate Commerce
Commission and has set Sept. 13 for a further hearing.
   ``This purchase, along with acquisition of the Soo Line's Kansas
City-Chicago route which we negotiated in June, will give Southern
Pacific access from two major routes to Chicago markets and,
through Chicago, important routes for customers across the
nation,'' said Mike Mohan, president of San Francisco-based
Southern Pacific.
   Rio Grande Industries, which also owns the Denver and Rio Grande
Western railroads, last month announced it had agreed to buy 532
miles of railroad between Kansas City and Chicago from the Soo Line
Corp. An application to the ICC for approval of the sale is being
prepared.

<HEAD>CIGNA Reports $12.4 Million Earnings Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CIGNA reported Thursday a 3.9 percent
increase in second-quarter earnings despite a decrease of 68
percent in the insurance company's operating profits on property
and casualty underwriting.
   Wilson H. Taylor, president and chief executive officer, said
the decrease, which totaled $106 million for the first half of the
year, was caused by ``generally inadequate pricing'' in the
property and casualty market.
   He warned the situation could worsen because ``there are no
clear signs that the underwriting cycle's decline has ended.''
   For the second quarter, net income totaled $144 million, or
$1.77 a share, on revenue of $3.8 billion. For the same period in
1988, the company reported income of $138.8 million, or $1.65 a
share, on revenue of $3.6 billion.
   For the first six months of 1989, the company reported income of
$229.5 million, or $2.80 a share, on revenue of $7.5 billion. The
figures represent a 5.7 increase over the $217.1 million, or 25
cents a share, from last year's first half.
   The largest quarterly increase in operating profit was in
investment gains, with $17.4 million reported for the past quarter,
a 241 percent increase over the $7.2 million reported last year.
   The property and casualty operations had operating income of
$26.6 million in the second quarter, down 68 percent from the $83.9
million reported a year ago.

<HEAD>Insolvent S&amp;L Goes into Receivership; Report Cites Accounting `Gimmickry'</HEAD>

   Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan used accounting
``gimmickry'' to inflate its profits, a private accounting firm
said in a report released Thursday as regulators put the insolvent
thrift in receivership.
   ``Seldom in our experience as accountants have we encountered a
more egregious example of the misapplication of generally accepted
accounting principles,'' Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. said in the report.
   Federal regulators, who seized the Irvine-based thrift in April,
placed Lincoln in receivership Thursday, chartering a new federal
mutual association to run it under the name Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan
Association, F.A.
   The action helps prevent its former parent, Phoenix-based
American Continental Corp., from making claims on Lincoln's $4.08
billion in assets. In April, American Continental filed for
reorganzation under federal bankruptcy laws.
   Lincoln remained open throughout its ordeal, and depositors will
be able to continue their business with Lincoln as usual, Federal
Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Danny Wall said Thursday.
   A federal audit found Lincoln had a negative net worth of $631
million as of June 30, and state officials said last week that
Lincoln was $906 million in the hole. Some analysts and regulators
have estimated the total loss to the government may top $2 billion,
which would make Lincoln the costliest thrift collapse ever.
   American Continental has been criticized for using Lincoln's
federally insured deposits for junk bond and other non-traditional
investments. Regulators are investigating whether Lincoln and
American Continental used improper transfers of funds and
accounting methods to make the unit look healthier than it was.'
   Thursday's 10-page report by Leventhal &amp; Co., which examined 15
real estate transactions at Lincoln, stemmed from a wider special
examination ordered by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in 1988,
bank board spokesman Bill Fulwider said.
   ``In order to boost earnings Lincoln entered into non-economic
transactions and turned to accounting gimmickry,'' the July 14
report to the bank board said.
   Leventhal acknowledged that its report was based on limited
information, but said they believed it was adequate to support its
findings.
   ``Lincoln was manufacturing profits,'' the report concluded.
   In Phoenix, American Continental attorney Marilyn Fried said she
had not seen the report and could not comment on its specifics. But
she denied that Lincoln and American Continental had used improper
accounting techniques, saying their books had been audited by major
accounting firms.
   She accused regulators of vastly overstating Lincoln's losses,
noting that officials had put the thrift's net worth at $112
million as of Dec. 31, and a still-solvent $20 million even when it
was seized in April.
   Lincoln was placed in the joint conservatorship of the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. and Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. on April 14. But until Thursday, it was still technically
owned by American Continental, said Fulwider.
   Fulwider described the receivership as ``a further step toward
final resolution,'' but said an immediate sale or liquidation of
Lincoln was not in sight.

<HEAD>Dollar Firm, Share Prices Fall</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, comments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar remained firm against the Japanese
yen during morning trading Friday, while share prices fell
moderately.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
119.53 points Thursday, lost 71.35 more points, or 0.20 percent, to
close the morning session at 34,708.46.
   The dollar was changing hands at 137.40 yen at late morning, up
1.0 yen from Thursday's close of 136.40 yen. After opening at
137.08 yen, the currency ranged from 137.00 to 137.58 yen.
   Traders said many market participants were reluctant to take
major moves prior to the release of U.S. unemployment figures for
July, due out in Washington later Friday.
   Norio Takeda, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said
dollar-buying during morning trading came from securities companies
wanting to procure the American currency to prepare for an issuance
of U.S. government bonds, slated for Tuesday.
   Other dealers said the dollar's firmess reflected the tension
due to threats by a group to kill another American hostage in
Lebanon. The dollar is considered a safe haven in times of
international tension.
   On the stock market, dealers said the market was very quiet
because of the start later this week of the ``obon'' season, an
annual summer festival.
   Many brokers take time off during the following week, and some
have already left, leaving many offices at less than full staff,
according to traders.
