<HEAD>Readout Depicts Debt Growing $8,000 A Second</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The U.S. government is going into hock faster
than the eye can follow. A new digital readout unveiled by a real
estate developer shows the national debt jumping by $8,000 a second,
a rate that made the last four numbers a blur.
   Below the main number that depicted the spiraling $2.7 trillion
national debt on a building in midtown Manhattan was a second figure
tracking each American family's share of the indebtedness _ over
$41,000, and growing.
   The readout, dubbed The National Debt Clock, was unveiled
Wednesday by Seymour B. Durst, a real estate developer who has been
campaigning publicly against governmental debt for a decade.
   Durst, 75, started warning about the debt by sending a New Year's
card to government and business leaders in 1980. At that time, as
the card pointed out, the debt was $914 billion and each family's
portion was $11,362.
   Durst said it cost his Old York Foundation about $120,000 to set
up the debt clock, which is at the northwest corner of Sixth Avenue
and 42nd Street, a block east of where the ball drops at midnight on
New Year's Eve.
   ``Just the interest on the national debt is more than the
(federal budget) deficit,'' said Durst before unveiling the clock.
At about $170 billion, the interest is ``the third largest
expenditure of the government, more than the combined welfare and
housing cost,'' he said.
   ``The clock is meant to give the alarm to people,'' he said.
   Durst then threw a switch and workmen four stories up on the side
of a building uncovered the readout.
   The numbers read 2 trillion, 726 billion, 728 million, 540-odd
thousand and a blur. Few passersby, heads ducked or holding
umbrellas against rain, appeared to take notice immediately.
   The clock is connected by telephone to Durst's office a block to
the north so that he can adjust it as indebtedness speeds or slows.
   ``It's running wild,'' said Durst. ``This year in four months it
has increased the equivalent of six months' increase of last year.''

<HEAD>Britons Squeezed by Fastest Mortgage Rate Increase in 50 Years</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's program to
transform Britain into ``a property-owning democracy'' has produced
an army of new homeowners. But many are being squeezed by her
determination to curb inflation by driving up interest rates.
   Mortgage costs have risen at their fastest rate in 50 years, to
13.5 percent from 9.75 percent last summer, confronting many of
Britain's 15 million homeowners with heavy debt and even the risk of
losing their homes, homebuyers' advocates say.
   Types of mortgages in the United States vary but their rates
generally hover around 10 to 10.5 percent.
   Stephanie Manasche, a single mother in Harrow, says her monthly
payments have jumped 42 pounds ($73.50) to 262 pounds ($458.50), and
she had to negotiate a temporary agreement with her lender to pay
interest only. That brought the payment down to 253 pounds ($443),
and she is still having trouble keeping up.
   ``It makes me feel very, very frightened, obviously,'' she said.
   The crunch could also make Britons lose confidence in real estate
and return to renting, undermining Mrs. Thatcher's initial aims.
   ``The present government is pulling the rug out from underneath
their feet,'' said Michael Brett, secretary general of the National
Association of Homeowners in Shrewsbury.
   John Doling, a professor at the University of Birmingham's
department of social policy, said: ``Many people will be deeply
depressed, deeply suffering from what has happened.'' Some, he says,
``will have to economize on food and they won't eat properly.''
   But lenders say defaults are more an outcome of unemployment and
marital break-up than of higher interest rates.
   They stress their eagerness to help borrowers in difficulty by,
for example, extending the term of a mortgage.
   ``As long as those people come in and let us know, there are
things we can do,'' said Mark Hemingway, a spokesman for the Halifax
Building Society, the country's biggest mortgage lender.
   The monthly payment on a new 40,000-pound ($70,000) 25-year
adjustable mortgage has risen to 388.42 pounds ($679.74) from about
304.93 pounds ($533.63) last summer, the Building Societies
Association said.
   Repayments on only the first 30,000 pounds ($52,000) of a
mortgage are tax-deductible. Most rates fluctuate with interest
rates. Fixed rates are rarely offered, and 40 percent of
mortgage-holders have their monthly payment adjusted once a year.
   The squeeze worsened last year when young buyers rushed into the
market and overcommitted themselves trying to beat the abolition in
August of double tax relief for unmarried joint mortgage-holders.
   ``When people see prices going up rapidly they feel they have to
be active in the housing market right now before it is too late,''
Doling said.
   In June Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative government began raising
interest rates, stalling the housing boom so that buyers who came in
at the top of the market can't get out at a profit.
   Mrs. Thatcher has promoted home ownership as part of her campaign
to roll back socialism, allowing occupants of rented public housing
to buy the property at preferential terms.
   Sixty-four percent of Britain's housing is occupant-owned,
compared with 55 percent in 1978, the Building Societies Association
said.
   But now Mrs. Thatcher says that inflation, which has jumped to an
annual rate of 6.8 percent from 3.3 percent a year ago, is her top
priority, and interest rates are her weapon.
   ``I think many people would find the irony in that,'' Doling said.
   Brett, of the homeowners association, said: ``We are predicting a
massive rise in the number of mortgage arrears and repossession.''
   In 1985, when mortgage rates went up to 14 percent, mortgage
arrears doubled, Brett said.
   Today some 300,000 people are in arrears, while last year, 25,000
families saw their homes repossessed, Brett said.
   In addition, he said: ``As soon as someone falls behind in
mortgage payments, even if they don't get repossessed, they will get
a bad reputation financially and will in fact be blighted for life.''
   The building societies association said up-to-date statistics
aren't available yet, and it expects arrears and repossession to
show a decline because unemployment is down.
   A 36-year-old bank employee from Liverpool who requested
anonymity said: ``A couple of years ago, the mortgage was
affordable. Now it is ridiculous.''
   Sarah Rudman, a 19-year-old advertising saleswoman, bought her
Shrewsbury home in September with fiance Stephen Chaloner, a
23-year-old software engineer. Payments on their 21,000-pound
($36,750) mortgage have risen 57 pounds ($100), to 220 pounds ($385)
a month.
   Now, Ms. Rudman said, they have to postpone the wedding and lower
their living standard.
   ``We were advised by a lot of people, `You ought to have your own
house. Buy now.' We panicked relly. We just grabbed it,'' she said.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the week since the last Soviet
soldier left Afghanistan, President Najib has been digging in
defiantly for a long struggle against the Moslem guerrillas who
surround his capital.
   As guerrilla leaders meet in neighboring Pakistan to forge their
own rival administration, Najib and his People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan are tightening their own defenses, both militarily and
politically.
   The bull-necked, broad-shouldered Najib seems very much in charge.
   Thousands of party members, including healthy youths and
middle-aged men of dubious physical stamina, have been called to
arms in recent days.
   The 43-year-old Najib, former chief of the dreaded KHAD secret
police, imposed a state of emergency Saturday, restricting such
rights as free speech and public assembly.
   A few hours later, Najib purged his Cabinet of seven non-party
members and replaced them with party men. There are still nine
non-party ministers among the 28 in the Cabinet, but none holds key
posts. Moreover, the Cabinet's even nominal authority has been
eroded by this week's creation of a military council dominated by
party politburo members.
   On Monday, Prime Minister Mohammad Hasan Sharq, known for his
long and close ties with Moscow despite being a non-party member,
was replaced by his predecessor, Sultan Ali Kishtmand, one of the
most senior party stalwarts.
   Party sources speaking on condition of anonymity say the
factionalism and animosity _ and occasional gun battles _ that have
marked the party since its founding in 1965 have been set aside to
deal with the external threat posed by the U.S.-backed guerrillas.
   Many of the party men elevated to the revised Cabinet or named to
the newly created Supreme Military Council for the Defense of the
Homeland are drawn from Najib's own party faction, the Parcham.
   One of Najib's strongest foes in the party, Sayed Mohammad
Gulabzhoi, leader of the Khalq faction, was shunted off to Moscow in
November. In the time-honored Afghan tradition of getting potential
troublemakers _ or coup leaders _ diplomatically out of the country,
the hard-line hawk was named Kabul's new ambassador to the Soviet
Union.
   The mobilization of party cadres is well under way. According to
one party official, 200,000 members who were not already in the
military have been mobilized.
   Hundreds of civilians arrived in Kabul over the weekend armed
with new Soviet-designed Kalashnikov assault rifles.
   Kabul is the key to power in Afghanistan, where rugged mountains,
vast deserts and few highways isolate most of the countryside.
   About 30,000 party members living in Kabul have already been
armed, according to government announcements. Food and fuel have
been stockpiled. The Soviets left behind enormous arsenals of
sophisticated weapons, diplomatic sources say.
   And Najib has wasted no time in playing the nationalist card. He
has repeatedly tried to rally the country behind him, saying
Afghanistan's very existence was at risk from ``conspiracies'' and
``armed intervention from outside,'' namely Pakistan and the United
States.
   His slogan is ``Homeland or Death.''
   Since Feb. 15, when the Soviets declared their withdrawal
complete, Kabul has been unnaturally quiet for a city of 2.25
million people.
   Eight rockets have hit the city in the last week, killing eight
people. In August, at the height of a guerrilla bombardment,
diplomats counted 120 rockets in a single day. The sound of
artillery, which less than a month ago was a nightly occurrence, is
missing from the mountains that circle the city.
   Foreign diplomats say the guerrillas are playing a waiting game,
hoping Kabul will collapse from within as supplies grow short and
discontent with the party rises.
   Najib has tried to portray a distance between himself and the
Soviet Union. There was no ceremonial send-off for the Red Army,
whose nine years of assistance cost 13,000 Soviet soldiers their
lives.
   Even the some of the fleet of Soviet-made Volga cars used by KHAD
agents have been altered so the Russian name no longer shows. The
cars now bear false labels proclaiming them Toyotas or other
non-Soviet models.
   ``The Soviet occupation was the uniting force for the mujahedeen.
Now that they are gone, the resistance will have to find something
to fight for, rather than against,'' said a U.N. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.

   Spitak, near the center of the Armenian
earthquake, became the focus of world attention when Soviet TV
commentators said it was ``practically erased from the face of the
Earth.'' Former Moscow correspondent Carol J. Williams was one of
the first Western journalists to get into the city then, and she
recently returned. Here is her report.

<TEXT>
   Scrawny cats and packs of dogs prowl for
food in the ruins of this city that bore the brunt of Armenia's
deadly earthquake.
   The only human contact they have is an occasional petting or
shooing from Soviet soldiers and Armenian volunteers sorting twisted
metal from broken brick.
   Residents have been evacuated. The new Spitak will be built three
miles away from its present site, the confluence of three seismic
faults.
   There are some, though, who refuse to leave. A handful of elderly
Armenians still in shock from the Dec. 7 disaster wander aimlessly
among the paths cleared to allow cranes and bulldozers to chip away
at the sprawl of ruins that were once the homes of 25,000 people.
   One woman shod in socks and sandals, protected from the freezing
weather by only a flowered scarf and stretched-out sweater,
approaches workers passing by to show them her withered hands. She
speaks in broken sentences that fellow Armenians say are
unintelligible.
   ``She's crazy. She lost everyone,'' a young Russian soldier said
somberly after the woman tried to communicate with visiting Red
Cross volunteers from West Germany. ``We give her food, but she
refuses to go anywhere else.''
   Central Spitak is eerily still, save for the occasional roar of a
diesel engine or the grinding of gears as trucks haul away debris
through the winding mountain roads. There is also the cackling of
crows fluttering between the abandoned skeletons of apartment
houses, darting in through the jagged glass clinging to twisted
window frames.
   On the outskirts of the crumbled city, orderly rows of tents and
tube-like housing stretch out across the parched saddle of land
between the towering, snow-covered Caucasus Mountains.
   More than 4,000 people live in the camps, waiting and hoping for
the day when their lives can resume.
   ``I came here to help and I just do what I'm told,'' said Sambak
Azizyan, a crane operator from the nearby village of Dzhryashen who
lost his 4-year-old daughter in the quake. ``As soon as there is a
crane available for me, I'm ready to work day and night to rebuild.''
   Idleness has been a widespread consequence of the earthquake that
destroyed all factories as well as housing. And the absence of work
to take Armenians' minds off their suffering has slowed the healing
process.
   ``We lost our daughter, our home, our jobs, everything,''
lamented Sizush Danelyan, eyes welling with tears even 10 weeks
after the disaster. ``We're being taken care of and have no
complaints. But the new city will be somewhere else, and we cannot
leave. I couldn't abandon my daughter.''
   She motions toward the nearby hillside that at first glance
appears to be covered with small metal huts and high fences. The
miniature village is the city cemetery, where the cremated remains
of some earthquake victims have been laid to rest with other
departed relatives in shrine-like enclaves.
   There are isolated attempts to force life back to normal. Two
workers in a metal kiosk nestled among the concrete clutter in
Spitak's center sell newspapers and magazines, although the trade is
far from brisk. A shepherd drives a flock of two dozen sheep along
the roadside north of the city, and farmers from the neighboring
republic of Georgia stake out the city's inroads, selling greenhouse
fruit and flowers for prices that exceed a week's wages.
   ``It's a healthy sign that commerce has returned to the region,''
said Manfred Blum, general secretary of the West German Red Cross,
who has spent six weeks in the disaster area. ``A pack of Marlboros
is the currency of trade. They cost 10 rubles (about $16), but they
can buy a pair of warm socks.''
   The tons of clothing sent to Armenia from foreign countries are
not visible on the backs of the earthquake victims, as most of the
homeless and displaced continue to wear the clothes they had on
their backs when the quake struck.
   Aid agencies like the Red Cross and church organizations have
concentrated on providing food, shelter and medical care, while
clothing and household goods shipped to the stricken republic
without distribution directions likely were pilfered after being
stranded at Yerevan's airport for days or weeks.
   Despite occasional corruption and chaos, Armenians are learning
to cope with the crisis and start the long work of recovery. Food
distribution points are marked with hand-painted signs and purified
water is piped to the tent cities from treatment stations near the
Soviet army encampment.
   ``Our priority is to rescue people from the cold and outdoor
life,'' Spitak's Communist Party leader, Norik Moradyan, told the
Red Cross visitors in his container-office near the biggest grid of
tents.
   Negotiating from his desk overshadowed by a poster soliciting
bank donations to ``Help Armenia,'' Moradyan offered his West German
interlocutors an inducement to choose his region as the place to
spend millions in donations.
   ``If you help us rebuild,'' he said, ``we could name the new
housing region after Beethoven.''

<TEXT>
   A group of atheists and agnostics is asking
major hotel chains to supply them with Bible-free rooms, saying the
Bible makes for ``gruesome bedtime reading.''
   ``Why should innocent people go into a hotel room with an open
Bible that is instructing you to kill homosexuals, to kill
blasphemers,'' said Annie L. Gaylor, editor of Freethought Today,
the newsletter of a group called the Freedom From Religion
Foundation.
   Ms. Gaylor said her group has written to a dozen hotel chains,
including Holiday Inns of Memphis, asking for Bible-free rooms for
atheists and agnostics.
   ``We're asking for freedom from the Bible. We're not saying they
can't offer the Bible to their other customers,'' she said Wednesday
from her office in Madison, Wis.
   Ralph Berry, a spokesman for the Holiday Corp., said the Bibles
at Holiday Inns are supplied by Gideons International, a Christian
organization, and are there to be read or not read as hotel guests
prefer.
   ``It's personal choice, to read them if they'd like to read them.
We don't intend on pulling them out,'' Berry said.
   In calling for Bible-free hotel and motel rooms, Ms. Gaylor
compared the request to the desires of non-smokers who want
smoke-free rooms.
   ``We want a non-superstition section along with a non-smoking
section,'' she said.
   Ms. Gaylor said her group has 3,200 members paying $30 annual
membership fees and many of them are offended when they check into
hotels and find Bibles in their rooms.
   ``There's a section that says people like me, atheists or
unbelievers, should be killed. When I go to a hotel room, I know
that is what the Bible says about me,'' she said.
   Ms. Gaylor said members of her group are being encouraged to
request Bible-free rooms when they check into hotels, and the group
is distributing small stickers to put on the Bibles the members find
advising potential readers to be wary.
   ``Warning,'' the stickers say, ``literal belief in this book
could be dangerous to your life and health.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's recent refusal to
call Japan an aggressor in World War II has drawn renewed criticism
at home and abroad that the nation is unwilling to acknowledge its
militaristic past.
   The backlash comes at a particularly sensitive time for
Takeshita, with dignitaries from 163 nations gathering in Tokyo for
Friday's elaborate funeral for Emperor Hirohito, whose own
responsibility for the war is a subject of sharp debate.
   When a Communist Party legislator asked in Parliament last week
about Japan's wartime actions against Asian countries, Takeshita
replied:
   ``There are various arguments on whether the past was a war by
accident or for self-defense. I believe, however, that it is the
historian's task in later ages to form a conclusion whether it was
or was not a war of aggression.''
   Asked if he felt Adolf Hitler waged a war of aggression in
Europe, Takeshita said, ``It is very difficult to define
academically war as a whole as a war of aggression.''
   Opponents of the monarchy and critics of Takeshita's ruling
Liberal Democratic Party reacted with rebukes.
   ``The Liberal Democrats actually believe the war was right. They
simply will not concede that it was aggression,'' said Tetsuzo Fuwa,
the lawmaker who put the questions to Takeshita.
   ``The LDP made Nobusuke Kishi, a former war criminal himself,
prime minister,'' Fuwa said in an interview. ``I know of no other
country where a man with this background can become head of
government.''
   Sharp criticism also came from China and South Korea, both
victims of brutality by Japanese forces in the years before and
during the war.
   An official Chinese newspaper termed Takeshita's comments
``absurd'' and ``preposterous,'' and warned that he ``may lead the
Japanese peole astray once more.'' South Korean media accused the
Japanese leader of refusing to recognize Japan's wartime aggression.
   Italian and Soviet newspapers also published commentaries
accusing Takeshita of evasion and failing to draw lessons from
history.
   ``Ruling politicians don't want to say they were wrong,'' said
Nobuaki Nakagawa of the United Church of Christ in Japan, the
largest Protestant denomination in this country. ``They deny history
because admitting it would hinder their militarization of Japan. But
their refusal to recognize Japan's actions increases the chances of
history repeating itself.''
   The question of war responsibility is touchy because of debate
over the personal role of the late emperor, who once was revered as
divine. Some critics say he encouraged the war, others maintain he
at least could have ended it sooner. Many historians, however,
contend the monarch was a figurehead, powerless against the military
Cabinet.
   Two Cabinet ministers were forced to step down in 1986 and 1988
after they said Japan's wartime actions were justifiable and did not
constitute aggression.
   This time again, the government moved quickly to try to head off
any diplomatic rows. The chief government spokesman said Takeshita's
comments were ``misunderstood,'' and reaffirmed Japan's
acknowledgment that it inflicted grave damage on Asian neighbors
during the war.
   In Beijing, Japanese sources said, Ambassador Toshijiro Nakajima
called on Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing to say Japan
cannot deny its aggressor role. He said there is no change in
Japan's position, stated in a 1972 communique when diplomatic
relations were established, of accepting responsibility for the
suffering it caused during the war.
   ``All the government does is issue a statement saying it
recognizes it is under international criticism,'' Fuwa said. ``It
refuses to acknowledge war responsibility because to do so would
admit the responsibility of the emperor.''
   Japan's conservative ruling party ``has no regrets'' about the
injuries and damage it caused, said the United Church of Christ's
Nakagawa.
   ``The party feels that the war was proper, and not an invasion;
they truly believe they were liberating Asia from U.S. and European
imperialism,'' he said. ``Their interpretation of history is warped.
They say war with America was wrong, but with Asia it was
inevitable.''
   Demonstrations are planned on the day of the funeral for
Hirohito, who died of cancer Jan. 7 at age 87. The church plans
several rallies and marches protesting the native Shinto religious
rites for Hirohito and Japan's imperial system.

<HEAD>Nasal Nerve Tissue Altered in Alzheimer's, May Aid Research, Study
Says</HEAD>

   Researchers reported today that abnormal nerve
fibers extending into the brain appear in the noses of Alzheimer's
victims, which may permit scientists to study the illness in living
nerve tissue for the first time.
   The finding may also lead to the first definitive test for
diagnosing Alzheimer's in a living patient, said study co-author
Barbara Talamo.
   Alzheimer experts agreed that studying the nerve tissue may
reveal secrets about the brain disease, for which no cause or cure
is known. But they were skeptical that the tissue, which can be
removed under local anesthetic, would be useful for a diagnostic
test.
   Talamo is director of the neurosciences program at Tufts Medical
School, and associate professor of neurology and physiology at the
school and the New England Medical Center, both in Boston.
   She describes the new research in today's issue of the British
journal Nature with colleagues there and scientists from Harvard
Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative illness that
impairs memory, thinking and behavior. It afflicts an estimated 2.5
million Americans.
   The new study focused on nerves found at the top of the nose
within the inner lining, where they are responsible for detecting
odors. The nerves extend threadlike projections into a portion of
the brain that is affected by Alzheimer's disease, Talamo said.
   Researchers took nerve tissue samples from autopsies of nine
Alzheimer's patients. For comparison purposes, they also sampled
nasal tissue from autopsies of nine people of about the same ages
but without similar disease, and five people who had other brain
diseases.
   Eight of the nine Alzheimer samples showed marked production of
nerve fibers called neurites that contained abnormal proteins. The
proteins were excessively modified by a chemical process called
phosphorylation.
   The proteins resembled those found in the brains of Alzheimer's
patients, in tangled structures within brain cells that are a
hallmark of the disease, Talamo said.
   In contrast, samples from only two of the 14 comparison patients
showed significant amounts of the abnormal fibers, and a third
showed a small amount.
   Those three people were among seven non-Alzheimer subjects older
than 65, noted David Drachman of the University of Massachusetts.
   Since the fibers appeared in three of the seven, they may be
present in many people older than 65 who do not have Alzheimer's, he
said. That raises questions about the fibers' usefulness in
diagnosing the disease, he said.
   Peter Davies of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in Bronx,
N.Y., also said it is not known whether samples from living patients
would be useful for diagnosis. Talamo said researchers plan to begin
studies in living people.
   Drachman and Davies did say that laboratory studies of nasal
nerve tissue from Alzheimer patients may help in learning about the
disease. But Drachman said it depends on whether the tissue will
show more convincing evidence that it reflects the Alzheimer's
disease process.

   The mere presence of more than 150 foreign
delegations _ including some of the world's top leaders _ for
Emperor Hirohito's funeral is a testament to Japan's towering
importance in the world.
   Yet the Japanese themselves are not exactly secure with their
status. They take pride in their affluence, but are also concerned
over whether their nation is ready to be a world leader.
   In fact, national self-scrutiny wrought by the emperor's death
has spurred public debate over Japan's global responsibilities,
foreign relations and priorities for the 21st century.
   Government officials say Japan intends to fulfill its role as a
global economic power but is unprepared to be a world political
leader or even a leader in Asia, preferring instead to follow the
United States' lead.
   ``I think the Japanese are embarrassed or confused when people
speak of a leadership role because we are used to following. So we
are confused or lost,'' Makoto Kuroda, special adviser to the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, told a recent
conference in Tokyo.
   ``We can't respond to demands from the United States and other
countries because we haven't discussed things among ourselves,''
added commentator and business consultant Kenichi Ohmae, ``We have
to develop our point of view.''
   Japan _ having made the leap from developing nation to economic
superstar _ has become more active in international affairs in
recent years, but has kept to non-controversial areas such as U.N.
peace-keeping activities and increasing aid to poor countries.
   It also seeks to avoid antagonizing its Asian neighbors, who
admire its economic progress but oppose a stronger Japanese military.
   The neighbors recall their treatment in World War II, when Japan
controlled the Korean Peninsula and much of China, the South Pacific
and Southeast Asia.
   ``Japanese are still a subject of terror and suspicion for
Koreans even today,'' said Lee Do Hyang, an editorial writer for
Chosun Ilbo, a Seoul newspaper.
   A 1987 Japanese government survey showed sizable segments of
Southeast Asia still see Japan as a potential military threat. Of
those polled, 53 percent in Thailand, 47 percent in the Philippines
and 34 percent in Malaysia said they thought Japan could become a
military power again.
   Growing trade inside Asia has raised the possibility of a major
trading bloc in Asia, led by Japan, that would compare with the
European Economic Community and North America.
   ``In the East Asian region, Japan is seen to be a country playing
a leadership role, but I don't think Japan has gone that far yet,''
said Toyoo Gyohten, vice minister of finance.
   The United States, which spends 6.5 percent of its total annual
income on defense, has urged Japan, which spends about 1 percent, to
do more to build up its own defenses.
   But military spending is highly controversial here. Japan's
post-war constitution limits its military to defensive capabilities
and bans deployment of soldiers overseas.
   In a recent government poll, 77.2 percent of the Japanese
surveyed disapproved of defense spending increases.
   ``Japan doesn't have the will or the capability to become a
military power,'' Gyohten said.
   Tokyo views its international responsibility in mainly economic
terms.
   It has announced it will double its foreign aid to more than $50
billion during a the five years ending in 1992.
   In addition, its $10 billion in aid in fiscal 1988 and a budgeted
$11 billion for 1989 have made it world's largest donor to
developing nations, according to the Paris-based Organization of
Economic Cooperation and Development.
   Japan expects the United States to continue as the leader of
non-communist Pacific Rim nations, Gyoten said. The question then
is, ``How can East Asian countries achieve the role the United
States wants them to play?'' he said.
   But many leading analysts say Japan must formulate its own
policies instead of following the lead of the United States and
Europe.
   ``This passive approach is responsible for much of the criticism
directed at Japan,'' Hideo Sato, dean of the College of
International Relations at Tsukuba University, wrote in the Japan
Economic Journal.
   Yoshiro Kurisaka of the Japan Institute for Social and Economic
Affairs contends that ``if Japan does nothing but pursue its own
economic interests, it will recreate the nightmarish (conditions
that) led to the Pacific War.''
   ``I keenly feel that Japan's obligation to act with wisdom,
compassion and generosity will increase with the approach of the
21st century,'' he said in a recent arcticle.

   President Bush arrived in Japan on Thursday to begin
his first overseas trip as chief executive, after voicing American
determination ``to stay a Pacific power'' and strenthen
relationships with allies in the region.
   Bush touched down aboard Air Force One shortly after 1 p.m. local
time Thursday, or just after 11 p.m. Wednesday back in Washington.
Bush and his wife, Barbara, were greeted on the Haneda Airport
tarmac by Keizo Obuchi, the chief Japanese Cabinet secretary, and
other government officials.
   Asked if she and her husband were able to get any sleep on the
more than 16-hour flight from Washington, Mrs. Bush replied,
``Lots.''
   Disregarding jet lag, the president headed immediately into
meetings with world leaders gathered in the Japanese capital for
Friday's funeral of Japanese Emperor Hirohito.
   First up was a planned luncheon meeting with French President
Francois Mitterrand.
   Earlier, Bush had spoken briefly to a group of U.S. servicemen
and their families during a refueling stop at Elmendorf Air Force
Base in Alaska, a traditional departure point for presidential trips
to the Far East.
   Speaking inside a hangar as snow fell outside, Bush said the aim
of his five-day, 18,095-mile trip is to ``strengthen key
relationships with our friends and partners in the Pacific region.''
   ``Alaskans understand that America is as much a Pacific nation as
it is an Atlantic one, and that the Pacific region is of great and
growing importance in international affairs,'' he said.
   Saying that his visit would also include talks of ``important
policy decisions'' with foreign leaders from the Middle East and
other areas, Bush declared: ``But we don't ever want to neglect our
friends.''
   ``And, yes, things in the Pacific seem to be going reasonably
well. But we are a Pacific power and this visit will demonstrate
that we intend to stay a Pacific power.''
   Bush spoke before several thousand airmen in blue, Army
infantrymen in camouflage uniforms and schoolchildren in parkas at
the air base. He recalled that one of his predecessors, President
William Henry Harrison, spoke at his inauguration for 3{ hours,
caught pneumonia and was dead within a month. Bush added: ``I will
be brief.''
   Bush's 90-minute refueling stop came at roughly the midway point
in his 16-hour flight on Air Force One.
   In Tokyo, Bush was to meet with various foreign leaders and
attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito on Friday.
   He was also to visit China on Saturday and Sunday and make a
five-hour stopover in Seoul, South Korea, on the way home Monday.
   Bush's marathon day began at 5 a.m. EST Wednesday in Washington
and was to last until after 7:30 a.m. EST Thursday.
   Although his arrival in Tokyo was to be near midnight, East Coast
time, it came at early afternoon in Japan.
   Bush planned a full day's work, including the luncheon with
Mitterrand, a ``courtesy call'' on Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita and separate face-to-face meetings with leaders of Jordan,
Israel, Egypt, Portugal and Thailand.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush would try to nap some
on the plane but planned no other steps to offset the effect of jet
lag. ``We're going to tough it out all the way,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said Bush did paperwork in his cabin en route to Alaska
and spent some time going over briefing books with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   Fitzwater also hinted Bush might have time during the trip to
make a few phone calls to senators to lobby for his nomination of
John Tower as defense secretary, but said there were no specific
plans for Bush to do so right now.
   ``We feel he (Tower) should be confirmed and will be confirmed,''
Fitzwater said.
   Also traveling with Bush were his wife, Barbara; National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, and White House staff chief John
Sununu.
   Mrs. Bush told reporters the president ``slept like a baby'' for
seven hours before leaving Washington.
   In his airfield remarks, Bush noted that the late Japanese
emperor had visited the base 18 years bfore. ``It was here, at
Hangar 5 at Elmendorf, that he became the first emperor in Japan's
long history to set foot outside his homeland.''
   Bush, a combat pilot who fought against Japan in World War II,
was to join 10,000 other foreign and Japanese officials in attending
the funeral. Hirohito died in January at the age 87.
   Bush said his visit to Japan was also ``a measure of our respect
for a valued ally.''
   Of other stops on his journey, Bush said: ``In China _ a nation
whose path I have long found fascinating _ I hope to build on the
friendly, stable and enduring relationship that now exists.''
   Bush was envoy to China in 1974-75.
   ``In Korea,'' he continued, ``I'll meet with leaders of a nation
that is rapidly joining the ranks of the world's first-tier
economies, and one where democratic institutions are gaining
strength each day.''
   The pace of Bush's visit to Asia contrasts with the last
presidential trip, then-President Reagan's journey to the 1986
economic summit in Tokyo. Reagan stretched the trip out to nearly
two weeks.
   Meanwhile, Bush voiced opposition to a free-trade pact with Japan
and suggested Japan might expand its defense capability.
   The comments were included in series of responses to questions
submitted by a Japanese news service, Kyodo, and released Wednesday
by the White House.
   Even though the United States recently entered a free-trade
agreement with Canada, Bush suggested a similar pact with Japan _
the United States' second-biggest trading partner after Canada _ was
not in the cards.
   ``We will stress the multilateral approach,'' he said.
   In the remarks, Bush also said that, while some Americans feel
Japan isn't paying enough for its own defense, ``we are fully
satisfied'' with the current arrangement.
   Still, Bush said, there is ``room for greater improvement.''

<TEXT>
   A trapeze artist grabbed a tiger by the
tail and didn't let go after the big cat mauled its handler and
tried to leap into a crowd of terrified circus fans.
   Hundreds of screaming spectators fled when the big cat escaped
during a show Wednesday night by the National Circus at Moruya,
about 160 miles south of Sydney.
   Trapeze artist David Wynn, 21, said he rushed to the rescue when
he heard the yells of the crowd and saw the Bengal tiger biting the
leg of its keeper, Brett Hall.
   ``The crowd was screaming and I could see Brett lying on the
ground with the tiger holding onto him,'' he told the Channel 10
television network.
   ``I went to grab the tiger but it scratched me on the arm _ so I
turned around and grabbed his tail and pulled him. I got the tiger
off the first time, but he went straight back at him,'' he said.
   ``I grabbed the tiger again, spun him around and then fell over.
I started to wrestle him and dragged him until I managed to jam him
between a tent pole and the cage.
   ``It was holding Brett's ankle, chewing on his boot. A couple of
people finally came to help and dragged it out of the arena,'' he
said.
   The 5-year-old tiger, named Moscow, was put back in its cage and
the show continued.
   Hall underwent surgery today at Moruya Hospital, where he was
listed in satisfactory condition.

   Americans and Japanese are looking at the
relationship between their nations more favorably after a period of
strain over economic relations, according poll results reported
Wednesday.
   A survey by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo
Broadcasting System also found that majorities in both countries
agree on the rise of Japanese power and are equally split over
whether U.S. might has declined.
   About relations, 79 percent of Americans said they were somewhat
or very friendly, up from 72 percent in May 1987. The Times said 68
percent of Japanese said relations were somewhat or very friendly,
up from 43 percent two years ago.
   In Japan, the Times said the poll found that 77 percent support
the emperor system today, with 73 percent saying they now view the
emperor as a national symbol and only 2 percent still see him as a
god.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. poll found that 63 percent of Americans
believe it is appropriate for President Bush to attend the funeral.
The Times added, however, that 66 percent of people under 30 approve
of the trip while it draws approval from only 41 percent of those
over 64, with adult memories of World War II.
   The poll, based on telephone interviews with 1,060 Japanese
adults from Feb. 16 to Feb. 19, and 1,233 U.S. adults on Feb. 18-19,
had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   The government has lodged a protest
with East German officials over border guards' reported fatal
shooting of a man who was trying to flee to the West over the Berlin
Wall.
   Chief government spokesman Friedhelm Ost said Wednesday that East
Berlin's envoy to West Germany was summoned and advised of the
official protest.
   On Tuesday, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper said a
22-year-old man was killed in the escape attempt Feb. 6. The
newspaper said a companion was severely wounded when East German
troops opened fire on the pair.
   The West Berlin Senate on Wednesday said that evidence collected
so far appears to substantiate the report.
   At least 77 people have died trying to flee over the wall into
West Berlin, according to Working Group August 13, named after the
day in 1961 that East Germany's Communist authorities began building
the wall.

   A fat black cat that makes Garfield look like a

   Ushiwakamaru, a 26{-pound, 6-year-old male, won $787 and a year's

   The organizers of Wednesday's contest say the cat, named after a
great warrior of yore, won for his enormous girth _ just over 27
inches.
   Runner-up was Hironosuke, a 13-year-old male Himalayan, who was
labeled the ``most spoiled cat in Japan.''
   Nekochin, 4, a male tabby, was honored as ``model cat'' for

<TEXT>
   The board of directors of the 8,000-member
Bar Association of San Francisco on Wednesday called for an end to a
state law banning same-sex marriages, a legal newspaper reported.
   Such bans were called ``invidious discrimination'' by the
association's president, Peter G. Keane.
   According to Thursday editions of the San Francisco Banner Daily
Journal, the association's directors unanimously urged that the
current state civil code mandating marriages between ``a man and a
woman'' be changed to read ``marriage is a personal relation arising
out of a civil contract between two people.''
   Such a change would give partners of both homosexuals and
heterosexuals many of the same rights now enjoyed as part of legal
marriage.
   Keane said banning same-sex marriages was a ``clear denial of
equal protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution by
singling out an identifiable class of people.''
   He added that a new definition of marriage is needed to correct
``invidious discrimination against non-heterosexuals who choose to
have a relationship that has the same quality and definition that a
husband and wife have.''
   Members of the board said the same-sex marriage law could
eliminate the need for so-called domestic partners legislation.
   Harry Britt, an openly gay member of the city council, has
proposed the legislation to make medical and other benefits
available to live-in companions.

<HEAD>Notorious Crocodile Eats 13th Victim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A huge crocodile called Bujang
Senang, or King of Crocodiles, by river bank people attacked and ate
a fisherman _ its 13th victim in 10 years, newspapers reported today.
   The New Straits Times and Star dailies quoted Police
Superintendent Nathan Ha as giving this account on Wednesday:
   Brian Tunging, 45, and four other people were fishing Monday in
two small boats in the River Muara Sungei Antek, about 600 miles
southeast of Kuala Lumpur, when the beast attacked the boat on which
Tunging was standing alone.
   As Tunging fell, the monstrous reptile and two smaller ones
ripped into his thighs and stomach.
   Police and the other four fishermen found his remains three hours
later.
   ``There were teeth marks on the boat indicating the jaws struck
the boat,'' Ha said.
   The crocodile has been described by those who have seen it as
being about 23 feet long and more than three feet wide.
   Last Chrismas Eve, Bujang Senang attacked a farmer who was
fishing in the river and escaped with slight injuries.
   While there have been other incidents, the last victim Bujang
Senang killed and ate before Tunging was Badong Apong, 51, on
Sept.27, 1984.
   Police sharpshooters in boats scoured area rivers then, but could
not find Bujang Senang.
   In November 1982, after another victim was killed, Malay witch
doctors went to the area to try to charm the crocodile into being
shot or captured, but they also failed.
   The jumbo crocodile is easily identifiable because of its length
and also because Bujang Senang has a white tinge on its back above
the forelegs, while almost all other crocodiles in the area are gray.
   The National News Agency Bernama has quoted crocodile experts as
saying Bujang Senang is more than 140 years old.
   While Bujang Senang means King of Crocodiles in the local Iban
language, it means Easy-Going Batchelor in Malay. It is believed to
be a male and has never been seen with a mate.
   No search was launched for the crocodile this time.

   Rain has fallen over wide areas of northern Italy,
breaking a nearly three-month dry spell that has hurt agriculture
and tourism.
   The weather bureau said rainfall was recorded Wednesday from
Liguria in the west to the Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige in the
east. Only light rain was reported, but heavy showers are expected
by weekend.
   In some parts of Italy no rain has fallen for 80 days. Water
rationing is in effect in some areas and agricultural losses are
estimated at $1.5 billion.
   On Sunday, Pope John Paul II said he was joining in praying for
rain.
   Italy's Alpine ski areas have been hit hard by lack of snow and
were not helped by Wednesday's rain. Rains in some areas washed away
artificial snow the resorts have been producing to salvage the
skiing season.

<HEAD>Cut Loose Failing Farmers, Panel Says</HEAD>

   The government should recognize that farming is
a business, not a ``way of life,'' and should stop propping up
farmers who can't make it on their own, a national commission says.
   The National Commission on Agricultural Finance said Wednesday
that programs that support farmers whose operations are not viable
will end up making American agriculture less competitive in the
global marketplace.
   It urged Congress to revise farm programs to eliminate farmers
who cannot make a go of their business, and to separate farm credit
programs from social policy.
   ``Agriculture is a business, it is not a way of life,'' said
commission chairman Harold B. Steele of Princeton, Ill. ``We should
not disguise a social program under a credit agency.''
   The panel, established by Congress in 1985, also urged lawmakers
to choose between crop insurance or disaster payments, saying
``using both won't work.''
   Congress last summer passed a $4 billion drought relief bill to
help farmers whose crops were scorched by the record drought of 1988.
   The commission, however, said that ``the answer to natural
disasters is not more credit.''
   The panel of mostly academicians, farmers and bankers sharply
criticized federal policies that use subsidized credit to solve farm
income problems.
   ``In essence, policy attempts to enhance the welfare of farmers
while maintaining low grocery bills for the consumer,'' the report
said. ``Although possible, this reactive approach is an impediment
to agriculture as it tries to compete in world markets.''
   The report said keeping all who want to farm in business,
regardless of capacity and ability, ``leads to antagonism by other
farmers and other sectors of the economy.''
   Keeping non-viable farmers in business even hurts those very
farmers, the study said. ``They waste critical years of their very
productive lives,'' it said.
   The commission did, however, endorse the idea of a ``safety net''
for farm families whose business fails.
   Commission members also advocated universal loan application and
accounting standards for farm businesses, blaming the farm credit
crisis in the early 1980s in part on differing lending standards
that proved inadequate in determining whether a farmer could repay a
loan.
   Congress bailed out the Farm Credit System, a cooperatively owned
network of banks and lending institutions, in 1987. Hundreds of
rural banks also failed throughout the decade because of the farm
credit crisis, which was prompted by falling land values, high
farmer debt and bad loan decisions.
   Lenders may have made better decisions in the go-go borrowing era
of the late 1970s if they and farmers had all been looking at the
same criteria _ balance sheets and cash flow statements, rather than
at collateral and escalating land values, the commission said.
   ``While an increasing number of borrowers do make available good
coordinated records, many borrowers still do not have adequate
records or financial statements from which to make informed credit
analysis decisions,'' the report said. ``This situation may stem
from the fact that lenders historically made credit decisions based
on collateral and not coordinated financial statements.''

   Rain and snow have helped improve soil
conditions in parts of the winter wheat belt, but parts of the Great
Plains wheat area are still gasping for moisture.
   After last year's devastating drought, moisture conditions are
being watched closely for signs of an unwanted encore in 1989, a
siege that a government economist said Wednesday could trigger a new
round of higher food prices and add to the farm debt burden.
   The federal Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said rain during
the week of Feb. 13-19 helped winter wheat in Oklahoma and parts of
Texas. But in Kansas, the crop needed snow cover and moisture.
   ``Snow cover was mostly adequate in the northern plains,'' the
report said. ``Additional snow improved cold weather protection in
Michgan; winter wheat was mostly good to fair in Illinois.''
   The facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments to provide weekly updates on weather and crop conditions.
   Mark Drabenstott, assistant vice president and economist at the
Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo., told the Senate Commerce
Committee in written testimony that the effect of the drought of
1988 on farmers, agribusiness, farm lenders and consumers ``was not
as great as had been expected.''
   He said, however, that ``much of agriculture's adjustment
capacity was depleted in 1988, and the effects of continued drought
in 1989 would be more severe.''
   Norton Strommen, the USDA's chief meteorologist, says a
recurrence of last year's severe drought is unlikely.
   Drabenstott agreed that the odds are against a repeat of the 1988
drought this year. But he added that if another drought did occur,
sharply reduced grain stockpiles would push crop prices to ``record
or near-record levels.''
   ``Many crop producers added to their 1988 income by selling grain
inventories built up in earlier years, an option that will not be
available in 1989,'' Drabenstott said in his written testimony.
   ``Thus, despite the very high grain prices that would accompany
continued drought, smaller crops and depleted inventories would
probably mean smaller farm income.''
   Higher crop prices also would deliver a ``severe blow to the
livestock industry'' by driving up feed costs, Drabenstott said.
Consumers, he added, would feel the effects of lower meat production
for some time.
   As for the drought of 1988, Drabenstott said ``financial
reserves'' from recently good farming years and a $3.9 billion
federal assistance program helped producers minimize the effects of
last year's poor harvests.

   The pollination of crops by honeybees is worth
at least $9.7 billion a year in added value, says a study by Cornell
University.
   Honeybees are used by the millions to pollinate major crops of
fruits, berries, vegetables, tree nuts, oilseeds and legumes. Their
keepers rent them out commercially, trucking the bees to crop areas.
   The study, released Wednesday, was prepared by Cornell for the
National Honey Board, which was authorized by Congress and
established by the Agriculture Department in 1986 to promote honey
and honey research. The board is financed by producers.
   About a million colonies of bees are involved in commercial crop
pollination, about a third of all U.S. managed colonies, the report
said. That is about double the number estimated in the early 1980s.
   ``To a significant degree, because of the hard work of the
honeybee we have abundant food supplies at reasonable prices,'' said
Dan Hall, manager of the National Honey Board, based in Longmont,
Colo.
   Commercial pollination ranges from blueberries and cranberries in
New England to apples in the Northwest and New York to almonds in
California and some citrus in Florida.
   Other major examples cited included alfalfa seed in the West,
melons in Texas, cucumbers in the Carolinas and Michigan, sunflowers
in Minnesota, and seeds for onions, carrots, celery and other
vegetables in many states.
   Frederick Hoff of USDA's Economic Research Service said that many
consumers are unaware that honeybees are used to pollinate foods
they are dependent upon. He said the study shows that pollination is
``even more important than we thought.''
   The Cornell study was based on 1985 information and showed that
the $9.7 billion in direct benefits represented the dollar value of
increased crop yields and quality as the result of honeybee crop
pollination.
   ``Crop quality improvements include larger and more uniform size,
desirable shape, uniform maturation date, and all result in higher
market value,'' the report said.

   The Agriculture Department says the long-time
slide in the U.S. cattle inventory has ended and that producers are
beginning to expand their herds.
   A USDA report on Feb. 8 showed that the nation's cattle inventory
as of Jan. 1 was virtually the same as it had been a year earlier.
Many private analysts had been saying the herd numbers would show
another significant decline.
   ``This expansion dramatically changes the beef outlook for 1989
and beyond,'' the department's Economic Research Service said
Wednesday. ``Beef cows number 2 percent above a year earlier, and
beef replacement heifers were up 5 percent.''
   Moreover, the report noted that the Jan. 1 figures showed last
year's calf crop was 672,000 head larger than was projected last
summer.
   Including dairy animals, the U.S. herd of cattle and calves
totaled a 28-year low of 99,484,000 head on Jan. 1, down only 40,000
head from a year ago.

   James D. Watkins was headed for a swift vote of
approval from the Senate panel considering his confirmation as the
first career military man to head the Energy Department.
   Watkins, a retired Navy admiral with broad experience in the
service's nuclear program, drew strong praise from nearly every
member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee during a
three-hour hearing Wednesday.
   The committee is to vote on the nomination next Wednesday.
Several members told Watkins even before questioning him that they
would vote for him.
   Although lacking professional experience in civilian energy,
Watkins showed a solid grasp of such issues as the future of
hydroelectric power, prospects for using methanol to power cars, and
deregulation of natural gas.
   He said the Bush administration was devoted to ``a future that is
energy-independent, healthy and safe.''
   Watkins pledged to shake up the department's management of its
nuclear weapons complex, a network of 17 major plants in 12 states
that develop, produce and test nuclear arms for the Pentagon. Key
parts of the complex have been shut down for safety and technical
reasons, crippling the nation's weapons production and raising the
specter of huge modernization and cleanup costs.
   ``It's a mess,'' Watkins told the panel.
   He said that while the government would have to invest billions
to upgrade the nuclear facilities, the biggest challenge was to
instill a better attitude in Energy Department workers responsible
for overseeing weapons production. The plants are operated under
government contract by private companies.
   ``Within six months you'll see a whole new face on it,'' Watkins
said in reference to the department's management of the weapons
production complex. He added, however, that it would take ``a couple
of years'' to change workers' attitudes.
   ``The DOE defense program has a culture not yet educated or
trained to understand each individual's shared responsibility and
accountability for safe, reliable reactor plant operations,''
Watkins said. ``We are now paying the price for this long-term
cultural misdirection.''
   No committee member aimed a critical word at Watkins. Several
heaped praise on him, saying his military background made him an
excellent choice for the job.
   Watkins sought to dispel the notion that because of his
background in the Navy's nuclear program he had been selected by
President Bush to be ``Secretary of Nuclear Energy.''
   ``While I expect to focus initially on the very serious problems
our nation faces with regard to cleanup of nuclear waste and putting
our nuclear defense operations back on track, I want to state
clearly that I intend to function fully as the secretary of
energy,'' he said.
   Watkins said he would work to promote a broad mixture of energy
sources, including civilian nuclear power. Nuclear proponents
contend that cumbersome and costly federal regulation is a key
reason for the recent stagnation of the nuclear industry, and
Watkins appeared to agree that regulatory reforms are needed.
   He said the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's plant licensing
process should be streamlined to relieve ``the constipation of that
process.''

   Congressional Democrats wrestling with
President Bush's fiscal 1990 budget are trying to put White House
officials on the defensive by forcing them to admit they can't
explain how new initiatives will be paid for.
   Budget director Richard G. Darman and Transportation Secretary
Samuel K. Skinner, dispatched to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to sell
Bush's $1.16 trillion spending proposal, became the latest victims
of the Democrats' strategy.
   Each man ran into hostile questioning from Democrats seeking to
learn which programs Bush wants to cut in order to pay for the
spending increases he is seeking.
   Skinner told the House transportation appropriations subcommittee
that Bush's proposals to boost the budgets of the Coast Guard and
the Federal Aviation Administration should ``come out of somebody
else's pot.''
   Bush is seeking to boost the Coast Guard's budget for anti-drug
efforts by 9 percent next year to $690 million. He also wants to
enable the FAA to hire more air traffic controllers and safety
inspectors, and to modernize its equipment and make other
improvements, by increasing its budget 16 percent to $6.6 billion.
   ``Transportation has paid long enough,'' Skinner told the
lawmakers.
   But this prompted Rep. William H. Gray III, one of the House's
Democratic leaders and a former budget committee chairman, to press
him on where the additional money would come from.
   ``You'd want it to come out of interior or education or somebody
else's committee,'' Gray told the cabinet member. ``We all want to
go and give wonderful statements about wonderful new spending
programs we want, but we all point our fingers and say, `Let's take
it from another pot.'''
   At a hearing held by the House Budget Committee, White House
budget director Richard Darman fended off Democratic attempts to
define the specific spending levels Bush seeks for various domestic
programs.
   In a spirited exchange with Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., Darman
refused to say how much money the president seeks for programs such
as care for poor pregnant women, veterans' education, mass transit,
or even the Job Training Partnership Act _ the bill Bush cited in
choosing Dan Quayle for his vice presidential nomination.
   ``President Bush's position is that he wants to negotiate the
answer to that, and you don't like that apparently,'' Darman said.
   Boxer told Darman that while Bush's proposals to increase some
spending in some areas, ``we haven't really seen the bad parts.''
   In the budget he presented to Congress on Feb. 9, Bush proposed
allowing defense spending to grow at the rate of inflation and
giving slight boosts to several priority areas such as acid rain and
scientific research. He made no cuts in Social Security and proposed
no general tax increases, but did seek limited tax extensions, new
user fees and asset sales to bring in about $17 billion in new
revenue next year.
   Perhaps most infuriating to the Democrats, however, was his
creation of what lawmakers have dubbed the ``black box.'' Bush
proposed limiting more than 1,000 programs, mostly in domestic
areas, to the $136 billion spent for them this year, and left it to
Congress to decide how the money would be distributed.
   Budget committee chairman Leon Panetta criticized Darman for
outlining options but not Bush choices in the hundreds of pages of
documents he was presenting to Congress.
   ``There have been too many games played with the deficit issue in
the past,'' Panetta said. ``My concern is when you strip the
rhetoric aside... some of the same games are being played.''

<HEAD>Dairies Losing Frozen Bull Semen To Thieves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JACINTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thieves have discovered there's big
value in bull semen, and a rash of burglaries has gotten so bad that
one dairy farmer says he may have to sleep with his semen tanks.
   ``There is a bootleg market for semen,'' Marvin Jeglin, a
representative of the American Breeders Service, said recently.
   In recent weeks, a record number of dairies in San Bernardino and
Riverside counties east and southeast of Los Angeles have been
raided by thieves who take tanks full of frozen bull semen, used by
farmers to impregnate cows.
   Five dairies in the San Jacinto area, about 80 miles southeast of
Los Angeles, have been hit this month, Jeglin said.
   The tanks themselves, which resemble Apollo space capsules but
stand only three feet high, can sell for up to $900 each, said San
Jacinto dairyman Vince Record, whose family has been hit twice in
the past six months.
   Each tank can hold about 2,000 straws or tubes of semen worth
anywhere from a few dollars to over $100 each, depending on the
quality of the donor bull.
   ``There are Secretariats in the cow world too, you know,'' Record
said, referring to the champion racehorse.
   And like great racehorces, prize bulls supply semen that is not
easily replaced.
   ``I had semen from bulls that've been dead 10 years,'' said Arie
Breedyk whose dairy near San Jacinto was burglarized last week.
   Police say they may have a difficult time cracking the case.
   ``There's not any way of tracing these things,'' said Riverside
County Sheriff's Detective Phil Sanchez. ``It's not like a VCR.''
   The dairymen are taking a variety of precautions to guard against
future thefts.
   Raymond Echeverria had already chained his tank to his garage
when someone sliced through the combination lock with bolt cutters
last week.
   ``I keep the tank inside the house now,'' he said. ``I'll sleep
next to them if I have to.''

<HEAD>IRS Hopes Electronic Returns Catch On</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The promise of a quick refund is prompting more
and more Americans to have their tax returns filed electronically,
leading the IRS to hope that the paper return will soon become a
thing of the past for millions.
   Through last week, the Internal Revenue Service had received
510,000 returns electronically _ almost as many as were filed in all
of 1988. Only 120,000 electronic returns were filed during the
comparable period last year; the IRS expects as many as 2 million by
the time this year's filing season ends on April 17.
   Electronic filing is available this year in 36 states but only to
taxpayers who are expecting a refund and whose returns are prepared
by a professional. If you like, you may avoid another bit of
paperwork by having your refund deposited electronically into your
bank account.
   Next year, electronic filing will be available in all 50 states.
But if IRS planners have their way, that will be only the beginning.
They are researching the feasibility of:
   _Allowing taxpayers who don't get refunds (about 22 percent of
all filers) to file electronically. They would pay the balance due
with a credit card, but that would require congressional approval.
   _Permitting taxpayers to file directly from their home computer
into the IRS computer. This would require perfection of computer
software and a system of protecting the privacy of the electronic
return.
   An electronic return usually produces a refund check within about
18 days, compared with five or six weeks for a paper return. The IRS
benefits, too, from fewer errors and less paperwork. Over 10 years
the IRS anticipates electronic filing will save $200 million in
processing costs.
   If 18 days is too long to wait for a refund, many professional
preparers are offering refund-anticipation loans.
   For example, Dollar Dry Dock Bank of New York has a 40-state
network that produces a refund check within three to five days. The
return can be prepared by the taxpayer, by Dollar Dry Dock
professionals or any preparer. Just filing the return _ not filling
it out _ costs $45.
   The bank sends a check for the refund to the taxpayer, who in
effect is getting an interest-free loan until the IRS check arrives.
   H&amp;R Block, which prepares more tax returns than any other
company, offers refund-anticipation loans at about 3,000 of its
7,500 outlets. Most of the branches of Jackson Hewitt Tax Service,
another large franchise preparer, offer the ``instant refund.''
   The IRS said Wednesday that it had received 24.1 million returns
_ electronic and paper _ through last week, compared with 23.5
million during the same period in 1988. This represents a reversal
of the trend of the last several years, when the number of early
filers dropped each year.
   About 109 million returns are expected this year.
   The IRS had processed 10.5 million returns by last weekend, an 11
percent improvement over the 1988 pace of fewer than 9.5 million.
   The number of refunds is up 9.7 percent this year, from 3.8
million to almost 4.2 million. The refunds averaged $805, compared
with $782 during the same period last year.

   Actor Robert De Niro will make a rare
public appearance at the premiere of his latest movie to raise money
for children with birth defects linked to the defoliant Agent Orange.
   De Niro has arranged to stage Saturday's premiere of
``Jacknife,'' a story about two Vietnam veterans, at a New York City
theater as a benefit for the Connecticut-based Brandie Schieb
Children's Fund.
   ``He just feels that this cause is very worthwhile and he's just
very interested in trying to help,'' Diane Collins, a spokeswoman
for the reclusive actor, said Wednesday.
   Organizers hope to raise $15,000 to $20,000 from the $25-a-ticket
premiere and a $125-a-ticket party afterward, Collins said.
   The movie tells the story of two veterans reunited 15 years after
the war whose strained relationship becomes even more volatile when
one falls in love with the other's sister.
   De Niro met members of Stamford-based Vietnam Veterans Agent
Orange Victims Inc. while filming the movie in Meriden. The group
started the fund in 1985 to help pay the medical bills of Brandie
Schieb, now 9, who was born deaf and without ears, and without most
of her right cheekbone, jaw and eye socket. Doctors believe the
girl's birth defects were caused by her father's exposure to Agent
Orange while serving with the U.S. Navy in Vietnam.
   ``It's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for us,'' said Hank
Schieb, who hopes to attend the premiere with his daughter and wife.

   The brother act of ``Rain Man'' co-stars Dustin
Hoffman and Tom Cruise was just as convincing in the flesh to the
Duchess of York.
   ``You look like brothers _ I'm convinced of it,'' the former
Sarah Ferguson, wife of Prince Andrew, told the actors at the London
charity premiere of the film Wednesday.
   Hoffman, who plays Cruise's autistic brother in the film, joked
back: ``I'm Cruise, he's Hoffman.''
   The duchess, in a black brocade Edwardian-style gown,
complimented Cruise on his crewcut, required for his role in the
Vietnam war film ``Born on the 4th of July,'' to be released later
this year.
   ``Your haircut just suits you,'' she said.
   As the Duchess moved slowly along the receiving line toward
Hoffman, the actor practiced his bows and frantically cleaned his
shoes on his trousers.
   ``I shall say anything but `Hi Fergie.' I have been instructed to
call her Ma'am,'' Hoffman quipped.
   The premiere raised $87,500 for the National Association for
Mental Health and the National Autistic Society.

   Comedian Richard Pryor was ordered to pay
$3,500 a month more in child support for a 22-month-old son fathered
with a showgirl extra who said she lives in a roach-infested
apartment.
   Celebrity attorney Marvin Mitchelson represented Geraldine Mason
in her successful bid Wednesday to have support payments from Pryor,
48, increased from $1,000 a month to $4,500.
   In papers filed with Superior Court, Ms. Mason said she and her
son Franklin, born April 29, 1987, lived in a Houston apartment
infested with mice and roaches and that she was unable to work.
   ``Now I am all but destitute,'' she stated in the suit.
   Miss Mason, a showgirl who met Pryor on the set of the film ``Jo
Jo Dancer, Your Life is Calling'' in 1985, said she became
accustomed to an extravagant lifestyle with the comedian. The
lawsuit said she received more than $65,000 from the entertainer,
including a West Hollywood apartment, a $5,000 bank account, trips
in a private jet and use of a car.
   ``His extravagant spending on gifts swept me off my feet,'' she
said in the lawsuit, adding Pryor became angry when she told him she
was pregnant ``and he told me he did not want to see me anymore.''
   Pryor, who has been married five times, appears in the recently
released film, ``Moving.'' The actor's publicist could not be
reached for comment Wednesday night.

   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland defended
Teamsters leaders set for trial next week and dismissed a question
about whether using showgirls as hostesses for a union reception
reflected poorly on labor's image.
   Kirkland addressed the questions Wednesday after the president of
the union that held the reception, the National Association of
Letter Carriers, said he thought the women would ``help improve''
the image of his union.
   ``Don't you take some things too seriously?'' Kirkland said when
asked about the Monday night gathering, at which two women in body
tights and mesh tops greeted guests, mostly union officials, and
posed for photographs with some of them.
   Earlier, Vincent R. Sombrotto, president of the 315,000-member
NALC, said, ``I think it improves the image of the letter
carriers,'' when asked about the hostesses.
   Several women labor officials at the AFL-CIO's annual convention
here complained privately Tuesday and Wednesday about the hostesses,
including one who said she found it hypocritical for the union
leaders to promote expanded child care and parental leave policies
designed to help working parents.
   Kirkland, at his daily briefing, renewed his attack on the
government's use of racketeering laws to seek to take over the
Teamsters union.
   The suit, set for trial next week, alleges the union for years
has been influenced by organized crime and names as defendants most
of the union's leadership, including President William McCarthy.
   But Kirkland, while not disputing mob influence in the union in
the past, said, ``I do not think it is a problem of any significance
in the Teamsters at this moment.''
   And he complained anew that the use of the racketeering statute
was inappropriate and there are other laws that call for the removal
of any union official convicted of most felonies.
   ``I think the approach of a government trying to put a labor
organization under trusteeship is a violation of the basic principle
of freedom of association,'' Kirkland said.
   The labor federation's Executive Council, which has a light
agenda today and Friday, focused on international affairs Wednesday,
issuing four statements condemning anti-labor efforts by the
governments of Chile, Burma, Korea and Poland.
   The weeklong meeting has been a relatively low-key event, not
unusual for a post-election year. Much of the focus has been on the
threatened strike at Eastern Airlines by 9,000 members of the
International Association of Machinists.
   The planned March 4 walkout has kept AFL-CIO officials busy
arranging for other unions to support the machinists while at the
same time asking President Bush to delay the strike deadline by
naming an emergency board to mediate the dispute.
   On Wednesday, however, Eastern pilots issued a statement saying
they would cross Machinist union picket lines if there's a strike,
provided the troubled carrier's owner grants them concessions in
their own contract.
   Kirkland and other council members were attending a rally late
today with Eastern machinists based in Miami, the airline's
headquarters.

<HEAD>Panel Says End Honoraria, Limit Outside Income, Expand Disclosure</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's ethics commission says top
officials in all three branches of government should curtail their
outside income, stop taking speaking fees, resign from corporate
boards and disclose more of their personal finances.
   In its third meeting, the eight-member panel on Wednesday
tentatively backed some of the toughest new rules and laws it has
suggested to date. If adopted, however, the recommendations would
fall most heavily on Congress, because panel members repeatedly
opted for applying already stiffer executive branch standards to all
of government.
   The commission's final recommendations are due on Bush's desk
March 9.
   The mood of the session was captured by chairman Malcolm R.
Wilkey in a comment about banning corporate board memberships. Vice
chairman Griffin Bell, the former attorney general, pointed out that
judges have been allowed for 25 years to remain on the board of
family-owned corporations.
   Wilkey, former federal appellate judge, replied, ``It has to be
changed. A man just has to decide whether he wants to be a judge or
not. That rule fit the ethos of 25 years ago but not now.''
   Both Wilkey and Bell recently persuaded Bush's chief ethics
adviser, White House counsel C. Boyden Gray, to resign as board
chairman of his family-owned communications company.
   The panel agreed that senior officials of all three branches of
government should be barred from accepting fees for speeches and
articles whether or not they get a pay raise.
   ``The evil of honoraria is so great from the appearance of a
conflict of interest,'' said Bell, in proposing a ban on the fees.
``People wonder who's paying all these honoraria. It undermines
confidence in government.''
   All eight members agreed, though they debated and decided against
coupling this recommendation with backing for a pay raise.
   Under enormous public pressure, Congress recently voted down 50
percent pay raises for the government's top officials. That
recommendation from the Quadrennial Commission and Presidents Reagan
and Bush was coupled with a proposal that members of Congress stop
taking honoraria.
   The only former congressman on the ethics panel, former Sen.
Harrison Schmitt of New Mexico, said: ``As a practical matter there
is no way to divorce these issues from the salary issue. A salary
recommendation has been made, but as we can all see it can't be
implemented.''
   But former White House counsel Lloyd Cutler, who chaired the
Quadrennial Commission, disagreed. ``Honoraria cannot be justified
by saying that salaries are too low. Salaries should be dealt with
directly.''
   Chairman Malcolm R. Wilkey, a former federal appellate judge,
summed up the consensus: ``The practice of honoraria has become
evil. We'll let others deal with pay questions.''
   This change, if adopted, would have a larger impact on Congress
than the executive branch. Executive branch rules already prohibit
any honoraria for speeches or articles written about the area of
one's federal job, so very few are offered.
   Members of Congress, however, may accept honoraria for speaking
or writing on their congressional duties, and special interest
groups frequently give them large speaking fees. The House allows
members to receive honoraria up to 30 percent of salary and the
Senate up to 40 percent of salary. Members of both houses are paid
$89,500 a year.
   The ethics panel also agreed that the total outside earned income
of top officials in all three branches of government should be
limited to 15 percent of salary. Again, this is the current
executive branch standard and is lower than that used in Congress.
Bush has gone further, saying he wants his top officials to receive
no outside earned income.
   On financial disclosure, the panel agreed to recommend more
reporting than now required for liabilities and for large assets and
income. Members suggested an end to current exemptions from
reporting home mortgages and debts to relatives, with Bell
commenting: ``I'm more worried about what a man owes than what he
owns.''
   Panel members also agreed that officials should disclose whether
any of their assets are worth more than $1 million _ reporting now
cuts off after $250,000 _ and should disclose if their income is
more than $250,000, compared to the current top limit of $100,000.
   At the same time, they recommended that smaller categories on
disclosure forms be consolidated somewhat. As Wilkey put this
question, ``What's the effective difference whether an asset is
worth $5,000 to $15,000 or worth $15,000 to $50,000? Why not just
$5,000 to $50,000?''
   The panel agreed that membership by top officials on nonprofit
boards should be subject to approval by ethics officers.
   ``If I were the secretary of defense and I was on the Boy Scout
board, they'd have more money than they know what to do with. I'd
make just 10 phone calls. The secretary of defense is too
powerful,'' Bell said.
   The panel also agreed that the government should have a uniform
rule on accepting lunches from businessmen and journalists. Panel
members preferred the executive branch standard, which basically
bars acceptance of the free meals. The Senate allows its members to
accept meals under $50 while House members can accept those under
$35.

   Oliver North's lawyers in the Iran-Contra case
are trying to blunt charges that he lied to Congress by suggesting
that he had good reason to think lawmakers couldn't be trusted with
government secrets.
   But under cross-examination, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind.,
steadfastly defended the record of the House intelligence committee
in protecting some of the nation's most well-kept secrets.
   Hamilton, the panel's former chairman, testified Wednesday that
for 18 months before the Iran-Contra affair became public, he relied
on White House denials that North was secretly helping the
Nicaraguan rebels despite a congressional ban on such aid.
   ``I relied on what Col. North told me,'' Hamilton said of an Aug.
6, 1986, meeting the intelligence panel had with North, then a
National Security Council aide, in the White House Situation Room.
   ``I believed what Col. North told me at the meeting. I did not
think there was any credible evidence to the contrary,'' Hamilton
said.
   The congressman also said that in 1985, he accepted as
``accurate, honest and correct'' then-national security adviser
Robert McFarlane's assurances that North was not raising money for
the Contras or giving them tactical military advice as prohibited by
the so-called Boland Amendment of 1984.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, is charged with 12
felonies arising from the Iran-Contra affair that could result in 60
years imprisonment upon conviction.
   Among other things, he is accused of obstructing congressional
inquiries into his efforts to raise money for the Nicaraguan rebels.
This allegedly included lying at the 1986 meeting and helping
McFarlane, who has pleaded guilty to withholding information from
Congress, draft false denials in response to congressional inquiries.
   Cross-examining Hamilton, defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan
Jr. argued that North rightly feared Congress couldn't be trusted to
keep secrets because it ``leaked like a sieve.''
   ``From 1984, 1985 and 1986 leaks occurred on Capitol Hill as a
result of members and staff members who provided information,''
Sullivan said.
   ``(The late CIA) Director (William) Casey told me he didn't know
a single leak from the House intelligence committee,'' Hamilton
replied. ``I will not deny leaks, but neither can I prove any such
leaks.''
   Asked about a newspaper report containing classified information
that appeared ``the very next day'' after the panel was briefed by
the CIA, Hamilton said he had only a ``cloudy recollection'' of the
incident.
   ``I don't assume for a moment that the leak came from the
Congress,'' Hamilton added. ``There are some very experienced people
in the administration who leak information after it comes to the
Congress.''
   He also denied threatening to leak CIA information himself in a
Jan. 16, 1985, letter to then-Secretary of State George P. Shultz.
   ``I did not threaten to leak anything,'' Hamilton said. ``I was
prepared to follow certain procedures of the House intelligence
committee to try to release information.
   ``If I had succeeded in that, it would have been an authorized
disclosure and not a leak,'' Hamilton said, describing an elaborate
procedure by which the House would meet secretly to discuss
releasing sensitive information.
   The matter was dropped, Hamilton said, after Shultz met with him
and said he ``agreed with my point of view.''
   Hamilton conceded Sullivan's suggestion that North's prosecution
``is a product in one sense of the controversy that existed between
the Congress and the executive branch in 1984, 1985 and 1986.''
   Sullivan tried to show that North can't be faulted for his
statements to the intelligence panel because they were made in an
informal setting when no transcript was kept and no oath to tell the
truth was administered.
   Even though it was called an informal meeting, ``it's an official
meeting of the committee,'' Hamilton responded.
   ``We did not administer oaths during my period of chairmanship of
the intelligence committee until the very end of 1986'' _ after the
Iran-Contra affair had become public, Hamilton said.

<HEAD>Fiscal 1989 Budget Deficit Smaller than 1988's Red Ink-So Far</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest update on the federal budget shows
the deficit for the first four months of fiscal 1989 was smaller
than during the comparable period a year earlier, but analysts
expect the good news won't last.
   The Treasury Department reported Wednesday that for the first
four months of fiscal 1989, which began Oct. 1, the budget gap was
$64.8 billion, 2.3 percent smaller than for the comparable period in
fiscal 1988.
   Economists nevertheless expect the fiscal 1989 deficit to exceed
the $155.1 billion shortfall posted in 1988 as interest rates rise
and the pace of spending increases.
   The Bush administration is projecting the deficit will hit $163.3
billion, which would be a 5.3 percent increase from the level of red
ink in fiscal 1988.
   Economist Paul Denoon of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New
York said the fiscal 1989 deficit is likely to be in the $160
billion-$165 billion range.
   ``As we get later in the year, we'll start seeing some stronger
outlay figures,'' Denoon said. He said expenses associated with the
financial failures in the savings and loan industry and rising
interest rates will contribute to the larger deficit.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in congressional
testimony this week, indicated the central bank was likely to
continue to push up interest rates in an effort to slow economic
growth and thus restrain inflation.
   Worries about inflation were heightened by the release Wednesday
of the Consumer Price Index for January, which posted a 0.6 percent
increase.
   The government actually posted a $2.8 billion surplus in January
due to a surge in revenue caused by quarterly tax payments from
individuals.
   Government revenues reached $89.4 billion last month, up 9.3
percent from the same period a year earlier. Spending, meanwhile,
was up 31.4 percent from January 1988 to $86.6 billion.
   Spending in January 1988 had been artificially low because Social
Security checks, which normally go out on the third day of that
month, were mailed out on Dec. 31 because of the New Year's holiday.
The change in benefits payments resulted in a $15.9 billion surplus
in January 1988.
   The biggest government spending categories last month were the
military, Social Security, other programs in the Department of
Health and Human Services, interest on the national debt and farm
subsidies.
   Military spending totaled $19.3 billion last month and $96.6
billion for the past four months, up 3.3 percent from the year-ago
period.
   Interest on the national debt totaled $15.9 billion in January
and $84.2 billion for the first four months of the fiscal year, up
11.1 percent from a year earlier.
   Spending for Social Security was $18 billion in January and $72.6
billion so far in the fiscal year, up 5.7 percent from the
comparable period in fiscal 1988.
   Other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, cost $13.5
billion in January and $53.5 billion for the first four months of
fiscal 1989, up 5.9 percent from the comparable period a year
earlier.
   Spending by the Agriculture Department totaled $4.6 billion last
month and $20.6 billion so far this fiscal year, down 2.2 percent
from a year earlier.

   Laughter rose from opposition
seats when the acting head of state opened the current session of
Parliament by proclaiming the government's commitment to clean
administration.
   The speech by Chris Heunis, substituting for ailing President
P.W. Botha, came a week after three members of the governing
National Party quit Parliament because of links to unrelated
scandals.
   In the ensuing three weeks, one of those men has gone to prison
for electoral fraud, and a former member of Botha's Cabinet was
described by an inquiry commission as unfit to hold any office.
   This week, 10 education and development officials were suspended
for alleged financial misconduct and the Cabinet minister who
oversees them was criticized for incompetence.
   A separate, ongoing inquiry is examining the affairs of Albert
Vermaas, a Pretoria businessman suspected of foreign exchange
irregularities. Vermaas has entertained senior government officials
at his home and private game farm.
   Opposition parties on the right and left have condemned Botha's
administration for failing to prevent corruption at a time when many
South Africans are hard hit by inflation and high taxes.
   Even state radio has called for tougher anti-corruption measures.
   ``The simultaneous emergence of irregular practices in different
areas has created a grossly distorted impression of rampant
corruption,'' the South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a
commentary Wednesday. ``However, the underlying reality remains that
too many serious shortcomings have been shown to exist.''
   Zach de Beer, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party, said the prevalence of corruption stems from the complex
bureaucratic structures of apartheid and the white minority
government's penchant for secrecy.
   He said much of the corruption has been connected to the four
nominally independent black homelands, where impoverished residents
have been governed by authoritarian, South African-backed leaders.
   ``From the beginning, the non-viability of these areas had to be
dealt with by the payment of large subsidies,'' said de Beer. ``But,
because of their alleged independence, no proper control could be
exercised over this handout of money.''
   Another major factor behind the corruption, according to
government critics, is the official encouragement of clandestine
business dealings as part of the nationwide effort to circumvent
economic sanctions imposed on South Africa.
   Brian Pottinger, in a new book about Botha's first decade in
power (1978-88), writes that government officials have grown
increasingly accustomed to lavish fringe benefits. He says taxpayers
in 1988 paid twice as much to finance perks for bureaucrats than the
government spent on education for the black majority.
   The three parliament members who resigned during the last week in
January were:
   _Manpower Minister Pietie du Plessis, who is being investigated
for property transactions involving his department that may have
benefitted his son. Despite leaving under a cloud, he is due to
receive a one-time $100,000 payment and a $50,000 annual pension.
   _Leon de Beer, who last week began a two-year prison term for
engaging in electoral fraud in his 1987 campaign in Johannesburg's
Hillbrow district.
   _Peet de Pontes, a central figure in an investigation of fraud,
corruption and perjury in connection with efforts to smuggle a
convicted Mafia drug financier from Italy into the black homeland of
Ciskei.
   In early February, a judicial commission recommended that
Amichand Rajbansi, a former Cabinet minister, never be appointed to
any official post. The commission was investigating alleged
irregularities in the Indian chamber of Parliament, which Rajbansi
formerly led.
   The scandals have extended into the private sector.
   Sol Kerzner, a businessman who established a regional network of
gambling resorts, resigned Feb. 8 from all his executive positions
after acknowledging that he paid a $1 million bribe to protect his
company's gambling rights in Transkei, another black homeland.
   Business Day, the country's leading financial newspaper, said the
environment for corruption was created 10 years ago when Botha
halted a major judicial inquiry into alleged misappropriation of
government funds.
   ``He tried to wrap South Africa in secrecy, and he has instead
wrapped it in shame,'' the newspaper said in an editorial this
month. ``The way to repair the damage is to enforce the law. A
government which does not do that is plainly unfit to govern.''

<TEXT>
   The FBI says the University of Michigan law
school's decision to ban its recruiters because of a discrimination
case will deprive the agency of applicants able to handle civil
rights cases.
   ``How are we to get top quality FBI agents on board if we are not
allowed to come on to top quality campuses?'' Milt Ahlerich,
assistant FBI director for congressional and public affairs, said
Wednesday.
   Lee Bollinger, dean of the University of Michigan law school,
said Wednesday by telephone he imposed the ban in December after the
FBI lost a class-action discrimination suit in Texas brought by
Hispanic agents. The ban will last through the end of the school
year in May.
   The discrimination suit was filed by FBI agent Bernardo Matias
Perez on behalf of 311 Hispanic agents. U.S. District Judge Lucius
D. Bunton, who found last September that the FBI had discriminated
against the Hispanic agents, is holding a hearing to determine how
much the FBI should pay them as compensation for denial of
promotions and assignments to unrewarding and hazardous duties. The
agents are seeking $9.2 million.
   Bollinger said students at the law school had brought the case to
his attention in September, saying ``it was in violation of our
placement anti-discrimination policy'' for such an organization to
be allowed to recruit at the school.
   Of the FBI's 9,500 agents, about 1,300 graduated from law
schools, he said. Over the past three years, the FBI has hired about
1,855 special agents, of whom about 320, or 17 percent, are trained
in law, according to figures provided by Ahlerich.
   ``If the bureau is to be sensitive and particularly able to
handle challenges of sophisticated crime problems that we have in
this country today, including handling of civil rights
investigations, we need very capable, sensitive applicants, and
lawyers fill that role in many instances,'' Ahlerich said. He said
he knows of only one agent who graduated from the University of
Michigan law school.
   The Ohio State University law school dean, Francis X. Beytagh,
told The Washington Post for a story in Wednesday's editions that
his school also banned FBI recruiting on campus although it allows
the agency to continue distributing employment information.

   Lawrence B. Gibbs is sounding much the same in
his final days as IRS commissioner as he did when he took over 2{
years ago _ praising the agency's overall performance and promising
better service for taxpayers.
   ``We aren't there yet ... But I would like to suggest we have a
good start,'' Gibbs told the Senate Finance oversight subcommittee
on Wednesday.
   Critics are sounding familiar themes, as well. The Internal
Revenue Service needs to exercise greater control over its far-flung
offices, says the General Accounting Office.
   And if the IRS doesn't replace the aging computer system that it
uses to process tax returns there's going to be ``a train wreck,''
said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., subcommittee chairman.
   On that point, Pryor, GAO and Gibbs agree.
   ``We are dealing with a system that is ... from the Ice Age,''
Gibbs said. It cannot be upgraded, and replacement will cost
billions of dollars and take a decade, Gibbs added.
   Pryor mentioned an estimate of $11 billion. GAO suggested $3
billion to $4 billion might be closer.
   Pryor convened the subcommittee to review a GAO report from last
October, which surveyed actions aimed at improving service from the
IRS. In addition to calling for a modernized computer system and
greater attention by IRS headquarters to its field offices, the
report said the tax agency must improve its own accounting processes
and methods of evaluating its services.
   The report said the relatively low wages paid IRS employees
hinders improvement of its services.
   ``If the agency cannot attract highly qualified people, it will
find itself at a disadvantage in dealing with lawyers and
accountants from private firms,'' said Gene L. Dodaro of GAO.
   Gibbs, who is leaving the IRS in 10 days, agreed with every GAO
recommendation in the report. He made these points:
   _TAXPAYER CORRESPONDENCE: ``This is not acceptable,'' Gibbs said
of a survey finding the IRS made errors in responding to 30 percent
of the letters taxpayers had written about their accounts. ``It is
not a computer that's going to solve this problem. It's our quality
control.''
   _TAX DEPOSITS: When he took office, Gibbs said, the IRS was
making about 120,000 mistakes a month in handling deposits of tax
collections by employers and others. Now, he said, the error rate is
4,000 per month.
   _TELEPHONE QUERIES: Another GAO survey found that IRS personnel
gave the correct answer to only 64 percent of telephoned tax
questions a year ago, down from 85 percent in 1982. One reason for
the wrong answers, GAO said, was the failure of IRS employees to
probe questioners for more information.
   ``You can't have employees asking questions indefinitely before
they give answers,'' Gibbs said, noting it would require 42
questions to cover every possibility in responding to a query about
personal exemptions.
   _TELEPHONE FEE: No decision had been made on whether to charge
taxpayers for calling the IRS with questions, Gibbs said. President
Bush's budget proposes a two-year test of such charges _ a proposal
that has been greeted with scorn in Congress.
   _TAXPAYER RIGHTS: ``We are doing everything we can possibly do''
to implement a new ``bill of rights'' for taxpayers involved in
disputes with the IRS, Gibbs said. He said he had just signed a
newsletter designed to acquaint all IRS employees with the new law.

<HEAD>Turnover in BIA Helps Perpetuate Abuse Problem, Witnesses Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heavy turnover in the government's Indian
affairs bureau has created a bureaucratic nightmare and official
neglect of child sexual abuse cases on reservations, witnesses at a
special Senate hearing say.
   ``I was put there to keep the administrative portion going,''
Robert Delaware, acting chief of social services for the Bureau of
Indian Affairs, testified Wednesday. Delaware told Senate panelists
he was the sixth acting chief in the social services division since
August 1986 and was unfamiliar with sex abuse cases.
   ``I don't care if you are acting director for one day or three
months, the impression you leave is that it is not your job _ leave
it to someone else,'' Sen. Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., angrily responded.
   ``I can understand the frustration of the people on the
reservation,'' Daschle said. ``We're failing at this.''
   Linda Guy, social services specialist in the BIA, told the
special panel of the Senate Select Committee on Indian Affairs there
have been so many changes in leadership in the division that it is
nearly impossible to handle child sex abuse cases.
   Margaret Allen, child welfare supervisor for tribal services in
the Gila River Indian Community, in Arizona, said she has never been
able to find an official within the BIA or the Indian Health Service
responsible for treating sex offenders.
   Witnesses also said investigation of sex abuse allegations is
difficult.
   Penny Coleman, attorney advisor in the solicitor's office of the
Interior Department, said the FBI, rather than local police,
investigate the crimes on reservations. She said the FBI lacks
specific training for handling child abuse cases, and has
comparatively small staffs for the volume of work in Indian crime.
   Other witnesses said the problem of child abuse was compounded by
jurisdictional problems, the isolation of the reservations and a
simple lack of money.
   Dr. Jane Burnley, director of the office for victims of crime in
the Justice Department, said child sex abuse is not inherently worse
among Indians than in the rest of society.
   But the federal government, which has jurisdiction over Indian
reservations, lacks mechanisms to respond to the problems the way
states do, she said after her testimony.
   Dr. Eidell Wasserman, director of a special child sexual abuse
project on the Hopi reservation in Arizona, said that for the last
10 months she has been trying to find money to keep her program from
going out of business.
   The project was set up in 1987 to treat members of the
reservation who were victims of a former teacher in the BIA school
who molested 142 boys during a 9-year period.
   After the teacher was convicted and imprisoned, the federal
government provided $200,000 for therapy and other programs. But the
funding is set to expire in June.
   Some of the boys who were abused now have become offenders,
compounding the original problems brought on by the teacher's
actions, said Wasserman.
   Burnley said victims' compensation has grown tremendously as a
way of funding treatment for victims of child abuse in the states.
   ``But not in Indian country,'' she told the committee.
   She said about $2 million for fiscal 1989 was earmarked by the
federal government for such cases among Indians, and Indians are
eligible to apply to state governments for money from their victims'
funds. But she said Indian reservations are usually in remote areas
where communications and transportation are poor, making therapy
much more difficult than in other parts of society.

<HEAD>Letters Written During World War II Finally Reach Destination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neither time, nor missing records, nor an
addressee named Smith, nor lack of a ZIP code could stop the final
two letters in a sack of World War II mail from reaching their
destination.
   The two letters from Sgt. Clarence F. Smith were delivered
Wednesday to his brother, Norman T. Smith of Henderson, Md., in a
ceremony marking completion of the deliveries. Clarence Smith, a
tailgunner killed in action over Italy, had written the letters to
his mother and a friend.
   The letters were the last of 235 pieces of wartime mail to be
delivered after their discovery in an attic in Raleigh, N.C., in
1986.
   The Postal Service spent 30 months tracking down the servicemen
or their relatives to deliver the letters.
   ``Thanks to the efforts of many caring people _ veterans,
reporters and postal employees at all levels _ we were able to find
Sergeant Smith's brother and to return these last letters from World
War II,'' Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank said at the Washington
ceremony.
   Smith's letters and those from 91 other servicemen were
discovered in an old Army duffel bag in the attic of an elderly
North Carolina woman's home by an exterminator.
   The bag had been hidden by the woman's nephew and contained
letters written in May 1944 by GIs bound for Algeria aboard the
troop ship Caleb Strong, the Postal Service said. A homebound
serviceman had promised to mail the letters for his shipmates but
never did.
   Smith's letters were the hardest to deliver, the Postal Service
said, because Smith is such a common name, they did not have his
full name, and some of his military records apparently had been
destroyed in a fire at the Federal Records Center in St. Louis.
   Another veteran, Pierre J.J. Kennedy of the 781st Bomb Squadron
Association, who was asked to assist, located information about
Smith through the National Archives' listings of missing air crew
reports from World War II.
   He found that Smith was a tailgunner on a B-17 Flying Fortress
bomber who was shot down and killed in action on a mission over
Verona, Italy, on July 6, 1944. He located Smith's mother's old
address in Philadelphia and through neighbors learned of Smith's
brother.

<HEAD>Eugene Roberts of Inquirer Honored by Foundation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The winner of the National Press Foundation's
top award urged his fellow members of the media to protest the spate
of defamation lawsuits against private citizens who speak out on
issues.
   Accepting the Distinguished Contributions to Journalism Award,
executive editor Eugene L. Roberts Jr. of The Philadelphia Inquirer
said such defamation suits could squelch public debate.
   ``Many American citizens are being intimidated by defamation
suits,'' he said Wednesday night at the awards banquet.
   Since Roberts joined the Inquirer in 1972, the paper has won 14
Pulitzer Prizes, including the Gold Medal for Public Service. The
paper has received more than 150 other major national awards.
   Others cited by the foundation were N. Christian Anderson, editor
of The Orange County, (Calif.) Register; Brian Lamb, founder of
C-SPAN; and Terry Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent who
has been held hostage in Lebanon since March 1985.
   Terry Anderson received a special citation for his dignity and
forbearance in captivity. One of nine American hostages in Lebanon,
Anderson has been in captivity longer than the others.
   Peggy Say, Terry Anderson's sister, accepted the award for her
brother. ``Terry's greatest fear is being forgotten,'' Mrs. Say
said, explaining she learned about his fears from former captives.
``This award sends a message to the world that he is not forgotten.''
   The Register's Anderson was recipient of the $5,000 George David
Beveridge Editor of the Year Award for transforming a suburban daily
into a dominant newspaper in the area, winning awards for design,
sports, photography and news.
   Lamb, recipient of the $5,000 Sol Taishoff Award for excellence
in broadcasting, was honored for creating the nation's first public
affairs television network. Lamb conceived of C-SPAN, and then
convinced the cable industry to finance it as a public service.
   Lamb said C-Span, which is celebrating its tenth anniversary,
reaches 21 million households and is popular abroad as well as in
the United States.
   Roberts, the son of a weekly newspaper editor, began his career
as a farm reporter for the Goldsboro, N.C., News-Argus. He also
worked at the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot; the News and Observer of
Raleigh, N.C.; and the Detroit Free Press before he joined The New
York Times.
   Roberts covered the civil rights movement in the 1960s and the
war in Vietnam for The New York Times before he served as national
editor.
   In 1986, Roberts was named president of Philadelphia Newspapers
Inc.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices rose sharply and finished at yet
another high Thursday on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while the U.S.
dollar inched up after opening lower against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 126.29 yen, down 0.33 yen from Wednesday's
126.62-yen finish. After opening at 126.13 yen, the currency moved
in a range of 126.10-126.37 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 331.85-point
gainer for a record 32,311.93-point closing Wednesday, added another
140.56 points, or 0.44 percent, finished at 32,452.49, a new high.
   The market's main index started lower after a sharp drop in the
Dow Jones industrial average in New York, dealers said. The Dow fell
42.50 points to 2,283.83, the biggest drop since Nov. 11, when the
widely followed index shed 47.66 points.
   After the initial loss, the market reversed and began to climb as
buy orders started coming in, dealers said.
   Participants showed strong buying interest because Thursday is
the first day of the March account, said one trader with a major
securities firm in Tokyo.
   The index's dip in early trading followed the release of figures
showing a jump in U.S. consumer prices and a remark by U.S. Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that he was disturbed by
inflation's strength.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Wednesday that the nation's
consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in January.
   Greenspan, in his second day of testimony Wednesday before the
U.S. House Banking Committee, said the Federal Reserve is determined
to resist any rise in inflation this year.
   In currency dealings, Greenspan's remarks that the Federal
Reserve has no intention of raising discount rates discouraged
market players by raising fears of inflation and prompted their
dollar selling, dealers said.
   Trading Thursday morning was light as Japanese investors stepped
to the sidelines to avoid major moves ahead of a three-day weekend
starting Friday, said one dealer with a Japanse commercial bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Friday is a public holiday for the state funeral for the late
Emperor Hirohito.

   America's back door has a new lock and no
welcome mat, Central Americans applying for political asylum are
learning here this week.
   Fewer than 1 percent who have tried to obtain refugee status have
received it and more than 100 have been jailed under a get-tough
policy that began Tuesday to weed out ``frivolous'' applications
before the immigrants travel farther into the country.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Wednesday
it was too early to declare a trend, but the sharp drop in
applicants, from 233 on Tuesday to 51 the next, indicated the plan
was deterring unqualified applications.
   ``We can only speculate that the word has gotten out and many of
those coming for purely economic reasons are not coming any more,''
said INS Harlingen District spokeswoman Virginia Kice.
   But immigration attorney Linda Yanez said immigrants will merely
go underground.
   ``My guess is that most people are probably going to just take
their chances and get apprehended,'' said Ms. Yanez, who helped
organize attorneys to provide free representation for those denied
asylum under the new program.
   ``If they get apprehended,'' Ms. Yanez said, ``then they're
before an immigration judge (to submit asylum applications), where
they're going to get a fair hearing, as opposed to this kangaroo
court that they're conducting over there.''
   The new one-day adjudication policy calls for the immediate
arrest and detention of rejected asylum applicants, who are placed
in deportation proceedings and kept in a detention center.
   Of more than 300 who applied the first two days, only 2 were
granted refugee status Tuesday and none made the grade Wednesday.
   INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson said the intent of the new policy
was to deter 100,000 Central Americans who he said otherwise would
enter the southern tip of Texas this year with unfounded asylum
claims.
   But immigration officials said some Central Americans may try to
cross into the United States west of the Brownsville area, where
patrols have not been stepped up.
   The Border Patrol has added 160 agents to Brownsville, which lies
at the state's southern tip 15 miles southwest of here.
   Processing of asylum applications previously took weeks and
involved relaying information to and from Washington. Immigrants who
were denied asylum were freed on their own recognizance while
awaiting appeals or deportation.
   Political asylum is granted to those fleeing persecution. INS
officials contend that most Central Americans are here to better
themselves economically, and do not qualify for asylum.
   More than 40,000 people have applied for asylum in southern Texas
since the INS noted a dramatic increase in Central American
applicants last spring. A total of 631 applied Monday, the last day
they could travel farther into the United States to pursue their
cases.
   The agency has added extra staff and brought in State Department
officials to issue on-the-spot asylum decisions. Officials say it
will take several weeks to bring 500 federal workers to the area to
fully implement the program.
   The INS said 118 single adults denied asylum on Tuesday were
detained at the INS Port Isabel Service Processing Center, a
minimum-security prison 15 miles from the border city of
Brownsville. They were held for deportation under bonds of $1,000 to
$4,000 and issued orange prison jumpsuits.
   For Richard Jesus Rivera, prison ended a five-day journey from
his home in Ulsulutan, El Salvador.
   ``I don't have the money for the bond. But I hope that my aunt in
New York might be able to send it to me. I don't want to go back to
El Salvador because there is too much danger because of the fighting
and besides, there aren't any jobs,'' Rivera said Wednesday.
   Single adults are kept in the prison, while family groups are
sent to an American Red Cross shelter in Brownsville, where they
must answer daily roll calls under the auspices of the Justice
Department's Community Relations Service.
   The two granted asylum the first day were a 32-year-old former
construction worker from Managua, who plans to settle in Miami, and
a 65-year-old Nicaraguan businessman and accountant living in
Brownsville, according to the INS.
   ``It was felt by the examiner that they did meet the criteria,
and if they were forced to return to their country they faced a
well-founded fear of persecution,'' said Ms. Kice, the INS
spokeswoman.

<HEAD>Fuel Economy Rule Due Within 30 Days, Transportation Chief Tells
Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner vows
fast action on setting fuel-economy standards for 1990 cars and
suggests he may not be bound by precedent.
   ``A new secretary of transportation has the opportunity to start
with a clear slate as regards (fuel economy) standards,'' Skinner
told the House Transportation appropriations subcommittee on
Wednesday. ``I start with a clear slate.''
   The Transportation Department and its subsidiary agency, the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, last year set the
corporate average fuel-economy standard for 1989 cars at 26.5 miles
per gallon of gasoline, 1 mpg below the 27.5 mpg level mandated by
the 1975 fuel-economy law.
   The standard sets a minimum average gas mileage that cars sold by
each automaker must attain.
   Skinner said he wanted to hear from all parties concerned with
the question before making a final 1990 decision, which would come
``within the next 15 to 30 days.''

<NOTE>House Panel Attacks Pentagon For Slow Movement On Drug Interdiction</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Pentagon officials are brushing aside
congressional criticism that the military is not aggressively
pursuing its new mandate to detect drug trafficking in the air and
the oceans.
   ``I sense your frustration that we haven't gone faster,'' Lt.
Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director for operations of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, said Wednesday. ``But we're going to do better ... and be
making significant progress over time.''
   The House Armed Services investigations subcommittee accused
Pentagon officials of dragging their feet on the drug interdiction
program, enacted last fall as part of a sweeping drug-fighting
package.
   ``This ought to be your No. 1 priority because this is an
emergency, whether you believe it or not,'' said Rep. Nicholas
Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the subcommittee.
   Defense Department officials rejected the subcommittee's
contention that there was a ``lack of enthusiasm'' over the
anti-drug program at the Pentagon.
   ``We're enthused,'' said Lt. Gen. Stephen G. Olmstead, deputy
assistant secretary for drug policy and enforcement. ``There's no
doubt that those of us in the Department of Defense have a role in
the war on drugs.''

   A federal mediator has begun meeting with
representatives of Eastern Airlines and the Machinists Union in an
effort to reach a settlement before a 30-day cooling-off period
expires.
   Charles Barnes, executive director of the National Mediation
Board, said the board requested the meetings ``to make, in effect, a
last attempt to resolve differences before termination of the 30-day
cooling-off period.''
   The airline rejected the board's offer of binding arbitration to
end the 16-month dispute. That rejection triggered the 30-day
period, after which the union will be free to strike and the airline
free to impose its disputed terms on workers.
   The cooling-off period ends at midnight March 3.
   Mediator Harry D. Bickford was meeting with the two sides, Barnes
said.
   Eastern, which estimates it is losing $1 million a day, is
seeking $150 million in wage concessions from the airline's 8,500
Machinists Union members.

<NOTE>Navy Dolphin Program Cleared</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Navy has been cleared of allegations it
mistreated dolphins and sea lions being trained for various
underwater surveillance duties.
   The Marine Mammal Commission review team, after what it described
as an extensive survey of Navy facilities and practices, sharply
criticized a former Navy trainer and other unidentified sources who
charged in November the service was guilty of animal abuse.
   ``The review team found the allegations to be substantively
lacking,'' states the commission's report, released Wednesday by the
Navy.
   The team ``concluded that allegations had been put forward in
such a way as to create an inaccurate picture,'' the report
continued.
   ``Furthermore, the team concluded that, had the sole motivation
underlying the allegations been concern for the health, welfare and
care of the animals, the former trainer would have made better use
than he did of the Navy's Animal Care Committee.''
   The program now includes about 115 animals, the majority of them
dolphins and the remainder of them beluga whales. The service trains
the mammals to detect enemy scuba divers and to hunt for underwater
mines. The program began more than 20 years ago.

<HEAD>FCC Reaffirms Syndication Decision</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision by the Federal Communications
Commission to let TV stations buy exclusive rights to syndicated
programs will create chaos in the cable channels, a representative
of the cable industry says.
   The FCC on Wednesday upheld its May 1988 decision to readopt
``syndicated exclusivity,'' intended to give broadcasters the right
to retain exclusive rights for programming they buy.
   Under the rules, only the local TV station that buys the rights
to a particular program can air that program in the local market.
The station can prevent a local cable operator from showing the
program carried by an out-of-town station.
   In a statement following the FCC's action, James P. Mooney,
president of the National Cable Television Association, said the
rules ``will lead to widespread program blackouts and substantial
viewer confusion and frustration.''
   For example, he said, a cable company operator will have to black
out a syndicated program _ ``Star Trek,'' for example _ from an
out-of-town station if a local station holds the rights.
   ``The impact of this on consumers will be that if you're
expecting a popular show like Star Trek to be on an out-of-town
channel at 7 p.m., it won't be there,'' he said. ``Some filler
program _ or a blank screen _ will be there instead, and if the
cable operator finds it too impractical to make all the deletions
and additions, he may be forced to drop the out-of-town channel
entirely.''
   Syndication refers to the free marketing of programs, usually
discontinued network series.
   In its decision Wednesday, the FCC also extended the date for
compliance from Aug. 18 to Dec. 31 to give the cable and broadcast
industries more time to prepare for the new arrangement.
   Cable operators had wanted more time to prepare for the change,
arguing that new switching equipment will be necessary to make the
program deletions and find available programming to fill the holes
created by the rules.
   Broadcasters, however, wanted a shorter transition time, saying
substitute programming is already available and the electronic
switching equipment is readily available.

<TEXT>
   Social workers say a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that protects them from lawsuits for failing to prevent child
abuse means more cases will be reported, but critics say it denies
children their constitutional rights.
   The court ruled Wednesday that the state of Wisconsin was not
liable for the injuries of 9-year-old Joshua DeShaney, who was left
permanently brain- damaged and physically disabled from beatings by
his father beginning in 1983.
   The boy's mother, Melody DeShaney, sued the department for
allegedly violating the boy's constitutional rights by failing to
prevent the abuse.
   The lawsuit contended social workers failed to take action
despite their suspicions the boy had been abused several times by
his father, Randy, before the child was hospitalized in March 1984.
   The boy remains institutionalized in the custody of the Winnebago
County Department of Social Services.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court, said
the state's awareness of the abuse did not mean it had a duty to
protect him because he was not in the custody of the state at the
time.
   ``While the state may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua
faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation nor did
it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them,''
Rehnquist said.
   Tom Birch, counsel for the National Child Abuse Coalition in
Washington D.C., said the decision ``should have a positive effect
on child protective services throughout the country.''
   Birch and others in child abuse prevention said the ruling
alleviates social workers' fears of being sued, and that a ruling
against the workers could have affected their judgment in reporting
cases.
   ``When they are not held to the high standard of liability this
case imposes, they will have the flexibility they need to protect
the child when appropriate,'' Birch said.
   Others, however, said the court's 6-3 decision weakens programs
designed to prevent child abuse.
   Elaine Olson, executive director of the Wisconsin Children's
Trust Fund, said the decision threatens the safety of children in
abusive environments.
   ``Essentially what they're (the court) saying is that children
have no protection under the Constitution,'' Olson said. ``The
purpose of child protective services is to get child abuse cases to
authorities who can do something about them.''
   Joshua's case was brought to the department's attention in 1983
when he was hospitalized for cuts and bruises. The boy was returned
to his father's custody, and social worker Ann Kenmeter visited
several times. The boy's mother was living in Cheyenne, Wyo.
   On March 7, 1984, Kenmeter visited the home but did not see the
boy. She was told the boy had fainted in the bathroom days earlier
for no apparent reason.
   Kenmeter did not ask to see the boy, according to court records.
   Joshua was hospitalized a day later for head injuries that
destroyed half his brain, court records show.
   Randy DeShaney was convicted of two counts of child abuse and
sentenced to two prison terms of two years each. He was released
after 2{ years.
   The Supreme Court ruled that even though the boy was in
protective custody resulting from an earlier incident in the home,
``the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an
individual's safety by having once offered him shelter.''
   ``We conclude that a state's failure to protect an individual
against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of
the Constitution's due process clause,'' the court said.
   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron White, John Paul Stevens,
Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   In dissent, Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote, ``Poor Joshua! It is
a sad commentary upon American life and consitutional principles ...
that this child, Joshua DeShaney, now is assigned to live out the
remainder of his life profoundly retarded'' and without the ability
to sue the state.
   Joining Blackmun in the dissent were Justices William J. Brennan
and Thurgood Marshall.

   Writers famous and obscure rallied nationwide in support of
Salman Rushdie, with some daring Iran to kill them along with the
author of ``The Satanic Verses.'' Meanwhile, two large book chains
reversed a decision to remove the novel.
   Some of the nation's most prominent authors marched on the
Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York and read excerpts
from Rushdie's book, which has enraged Moslems and prompted Iran's
fundamentalist government to put a price on the author's head and
threaten those involved with its publication.
   Rallies or readings also were held Wednesday in Washington, Los
Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Boston.
   At the New York reading, Norman Mailer said authors should
``stand in his place'' if Rushdie is killed _ a challenge to Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to kill them all.
   ``Join with me ... in such a vow, and we are relatively safe,''
Mailer told the gathering. ``At least, we are safer to a
considerable degree, and can feel honorable to ourselves. We will
have struck a real blow for freedom.''
   Boston author James Carroll expressed similar sentiments at a
gathering in Cambridge, Mass., where Rushdie had been scheduled to
read from his novel Wednesday night. Rushdie's promotional tour was
canceled when he went into hiding.
   ``We are here to be with Rushdie,'' Carroll told more than 100
people at a panel discussion on the novel. ``The world should be
with him and not permit harm to come to him. If you kill him, you
have only begun _ you will have to kill us all.''
   However, in Los Angeles, where Alvin Toffler, Betty Friedan and
others gathered at a reading held by the PEN Center West, science
fiction writer Ray Bradbury counseled calm in the face of the
Iranian threat. He stressed the historic ties between Western and
Middle Eastern culture.
   ``Let's guarantee that all of our libraries remain intact. ...
We've got Hitler and Gengis Khan and Lyndon Baines Johnson up there
but we don't take them off the shelves,'' Bradbury said. ``They're
all monsters in their own way but we ... learn from the monsters of
history.''
   In both Boston and New York, demonstrators rallied in front of B.
Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble bookstores.
   Those bookstore chains, which are under common ownership, had
pulled the book from their shelves last week. However, they reversed
themselves later Wednesday and said they would have ``The Satanic
Verses'' in stock in about 10 days.
   The decision was made at ``the urging of an overwhelming majority
of ... store managers and employees,'' according to a statement.
   The Waldenbooks chain, the nation's largest, continued its policy
of not displaying the book but selling it on request. The New York
Times reported in today's editions, however, that because some of
the 1,200-store chain's managers objected to the ban, Waldenbooks
president quietly sent a memo Friday giving them the option of
displaying the book.
   In San Francisco, vandals spray-painted the word ``cowards'' on
the windows of a B. Dalton and a Waldenbooks store. In Birmingham,
Ala., the nation's fourth largest bookstore chain, Bookland, Inc.,
said it would continue to stock ``The Satanic Verses.''
   At Dutton's Books in North Hollywood, Calif., owner Davis Dutton
had his full-time workers vote to decide whether to display ``The
Satanic Verses.'' Without hesitation, he said, they favored it.
   The New York reading, sponsored by PEN American Center, Article
19 and The Authors Guild, featured authors Susan Sontag, Anthony
Lukas, E.L. Doctorow, John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion, among
others.
   Robert Massie, president of The Authors Guild, called on writers
to have their books pulled from any bookstore that pulled Rushdie's
book. Mailer and Gay Talese said they supported such a move.
   ``It's the most important issue in my lifetime as an American
writer,'' said Talese.
   Sontag said the authors must display ``solidarity, complicity and
co-responsibility'' with Rushdie. She read a statement from
Rushdie's American-born wife, writer Marianne Wiggins, who is in
hiding with her husband.
   ``Writers everywhere have been weighed and measured by the edict
from Iran,'' Ms. Wiggins said. ``We are a dangerous breed and always
have been, because words outlive their authors. ... Only fear can
stop a writer's writing. Only fear can stop a book from being sold.''
   About 25 Moslems protested across the street, carrying signs
reading, ``Satanic Verses is blasphemous'' and ``Rushdie is a friend
of Satan.''
   At the protest march, nearly 300 writers gathered in the rain
across the street from the Iranian mission, carrying such signs as
``Respect our religion _ freedom of speech'' and ``Free Speech Is
Fundamental.''

   Bobby McFerrin's feel-good song ``Don't Worry,
Be Happy'' was the choice of the music academy for song and record
of the year over Tracy Chapman's downhearted ``Fast Car'' at the
31st Grammy awards.
   McFerrin, the vocal gymnast who uses his voice and body as an
instrument, won four Grammys Wednesday night, while Miss Chapman, a
shy 25-year-old folksinger from Boston whose self-titled album dealt
with racism, poverty and desperation, won three trophies.
   ``I think it was so popular because it went to the spirit,''
McFerrin said backstage of his song. ``I think, given the mood at
the time, it was such that people wanted something uplifting and
jovial and funny. The tempo was nice.''
   Both big winners lost to George Michael for album of the year. He
won for his platinum ``Faith,'' a crossover blend of ballads, rock
and soulful pop, including the hit single ``I Want Your Sex.''
   Fifteen of the Grammys were handed out in a 3-hour, 20-minute
long ceremony broadcast live to the East Coast by CBS. The rest of
the 76 awards for the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences were handed out during a pre-broadcast ceremony.
   Singer Anita Baker took two rhythm &amp; blues trophies for her
``Giving You The Best That I Got,'' including best female
performance and a shared songwriting award with Skip Scarborough and
Randy Holland.
   In country music, Randy Travis won best male vocal with ``Old 8 X
10'' and K.T. Oslin won female vocal honors for ``Hold Me,'' which
also was voted best country song. The Judds won best country group
for ``Give a Little Love.''
   Willie Dixon, the 73-year-old blues master whose songs have been
hits for so many rock groups, finally won his first Grammy for his
``Hidden Charms'' album in the best traditional blues recording
category. He mounted the stage with the aid of a cane and received a
standing ovation.
   ``I've been in the music business for about 50 years,'' Dixon
said backstage. ``It's about time, don't you think?''
   Dixon's compositions for rock groups include such hits as
``Spoonful'' for the British supergroup Cream in the late 1960s.
   McFerrin, asked by reporters about the difference in musical
style between him and Chapman, said he didn't like the idea of
competition with her.
   ``I am touched by her music,'' he said.``This is by no means a
gauge of artistic ability.''
   Besides best song and record, McFerrin won best pop male vocal
for ``Don't Worry'' and the male jazz vocal award for the song
``Brothers.''
   Chapman did not appear backstage to talk to reporters. Her
Grammys were for best contemporary folk recording, best new artist,
and best pop female vocal performance for ``Fast Car,'' a song about
a woman trying to escape poverty by driving away from it with her
jobless boyfriend.
   Chapman's debut album deals with such subjects as poverty, racism
and revolution and was a surprise hit in 1988, selling more than 3
million copies.
   ``I want to thank my family _ my mother, who bought me my first
guitar, my sister, who's always been my best audience, best critic
and best friend,'' Chapman said tearfully as she accepted the award
for best female pop vocalist.
   A check of Grammy records showed ``Don't Worry, Be Happy'' was
the first a capella song, or one without instrumental background, to
win best song and record of the year. Another a capella group, the
sextet Take 6, won the soul gospel duo-group award for their
self-titled debut album.
   In a new category, hard rock-metal vocal or instrumental, the
high-voltage rockers Jethro Tull won for ``Crest of a Knave,''
defeating newer groups such as Metallica and Jane's Addiction.
   Another new category _ rap _ was hit by a boycott by some of the
major nominees. The best song was ``Parents Just Don't Understand''
by D.J. Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince, who were among those not
attending the show because the award was given during the
pre-telecast presentations.
   ``I personally felt that the boycott was negative,'' said Kool
Moe Dee, an award presenter. ``I understand that they felt a little
upset because they didn't get the rap segment on television, but I
think it was more important for the rap fans, for America, to see
rappers in a different light.''
   Neil Dorfsman was named producer of the year for British rocker
Sting's album, ``... Nothing Like The Sun.''
   The late Roy Orbison won his third Grammy, sharing best country
vocal collaboration with country singer k.d. lang for their version
of Orbison's ``Crying.''
   Tina Turner won the female rock vocalist prize with ``Tina Live
in Europe.'' Robert Palmer won male rock vocalist for ``Simply
Irresistible.''
   Manhattan Transfer, the harmonious jazz vocal quartet, were
awarded best pop performance by a duo or group for the single
``Brasil.''
   Pop singer Linda Ronstadt took honors in the Mexican-American
category for her album ``Canciones De Mi Padre,'' dedicated to her
father's heritage.
   Terence Trent D'Arby won best male rhythm &amp; blues vocal for
``Introducing The Hardline According to Terence Trent D'Arby.''
   Irish rockers U2 won for rock performance by a group for the
single ``Desire'' and music video performance for ``Where The
Streets Have No Name.''
   Lifetime achievement awards were given to dancer-actor Fred
Astaire, blues chanteuse Bessie Smith, jazz pianist Art Tatum,
cellist Pablo Casals, violinist Jascha Heifetz, singer-actress Lena
Horne, soprano Leontyne Price, singer Sarah Vaughan, and trumpeter
Dizzy Gillespie.
   Other winners included the Rev. Jesse Jackson for best spoken
word recording for a speech included on Aretha Franklin's ``One
Lord, One Faith, One Baptism'' album. Franklin's album also won best
female soul gospel performance.
   Grammy winners are determined by balloting among members of the
academy, who are recording artists, songwriters, musicians,
producers and technicians.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet ballet company that was left on shaky
footing when its original backers pulled out made its New York debut
thanks to an outpouring of support from the business and dance world.
   Lead dancer Vadim Pisarev said Wednesday night's performance was
everything the group had hoped for.
   ``We got a 10-minute standing ovation. Everything went very well.
We are extremely pleased,'' he said.
   New York arts patron Howard Gilman, averting an embarrassing
international incident, mobilized the business and dance worlds when
the Donetsk Ballet's original backers bailed out in mid-tour,
leaving the visiting performers stranded and penniless in Baltimore.
   ``These people started out in Baltimore eating pizzas donated by
theater ushers,'' Gilman said. ``I think everybody understood there
was something more at stake than just a company that wasn't able to
perform. It was everyone's reputation.''
   Businesses, ballet lovers and even a New Jersey firehouse pitched
in with free meals, cash and messages of hope. The artistic director
of the American Ballet Theatre, Mikhail Baryshnikov, provided
technical and moral support; Eliot Feld, founder of the Feld Ballet,
treated the dancers to dinner.
   With the help of I.C.M. Artists, a concert management firm based
in New York City, Gilman booked the Donetsk into New York's City
Center, with a Wednesday night debut. Future appearances were
scheduled at the National Theater in Washington and the Shubert
Theater in Philadelphia.
   ``We were doing what ordinarily can't be done: putting together
an engagement and a tour in less than a week. Most often, it takes
six months or a year,'' Gilman said. ``This disaster was about to
happen and I thought someone should do something.''
   The Donetsk is a lesser-known but well-regarded classical company
from the Ukraine with 59 dancers, most under age 25, plus a handful
of support staff.
   The first performance was Feb. 2 in Baltimore on a tour that was
also to include Columbus, Ohio; Detroit; Chicago; Kansas City, Mo.;
and other cities.
   Disaster struck Feb. 5 when the California-based promoter, Heart
of Art, announced that Californian and Mexican investors had
withheld $200,000 because dancers from better-known companies like
the Kirov Ballet couldn't leave their country to join the tour, as
promised.
   ``I was totally broken _ like a bird that had flown into an
obstacle,'' said the 24-year-old Pisarev.
   Members of the company feared that if they were sent home after
only five performances in Baltimore, the tour would be construed as
an artistic rather than a managerial failure.
   Robert M. Pomory, president of the Lyric Opera House in
Baltimore, donated daily rehearsal space and paid for hotels and
meals while the troupe was in limbo. A benefit performance Feb. 8
brought in $4,200. A Baltimore hospital donated its services after
dancer Alexander Boytsov, 36, broke his foot.
   Gilman stepped in to revive the tour on Feb. 9.
   Wednesday's debut attracted nearly a full house that included
many well-known faces, among them actresses Joanne Woodward and
Isabella Rossellini.
   ``The audience gave us the kind of welcome and applause we had
not experienced before,'' Pisarev's wife, prima ballerina Inna
Dorofeyeva, 22, said in her native Ukrainian. ``They applauded for
10 minutes. We were so pleased.''
   ``We were very nervous. How could we not be. It was our first
time in New York,'' Pisarev said.
   To those who helped turned things around for the troupe, Pisarev
added in his limited English: ``Thank you very much.''

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Hit Another Record High, Dollar Down Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's leading index closed
today at a record high for the second consecutive day, while the
U.S. dollar declined against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 140.56 points, or 0.44
percent, closing at 32,452.49. The index had gained 331.85 points
for a record 32,311.93-point close Wednesday.
   In early trading, the index fell slightly, in part because of a
sharp overnight drop in the Dow Jones industrial average in New
York, said a dealer with Nomura Securities in Tokyo. The Dow fell
42.50 points to 2,283.83, the biggest drop since Nov. 11, when the
index shed 47.66 points.
   But the Nikkei soon began to rise and continued upward amid
expectations for a consistent rise in the Tokyo index, the dealer
added, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Because today is the first day for March accounts, market
players were very motivated to buy,'' he said. Share prices usually
rise in March as securities firms try to boost sales before the new
business year starts in April.
   Even on the eve of Emperor Hirohito's state funeral, trading was
heavy, he said. An estimated 2 billion shares were traded on the
first section, where auto and electrical shares were among gainers.
   ``Since economic factors, including foreign exchange rates, are
stable now, nobody was afraid of buying issues before the three-day
weekend,'' he said.
   Friday has been declared a public holiday for the emperor's
funeral.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 126.29 yen, down 0.33
yen from Wednesday's close of 126.62 yen. After opening at 126.13
yen, the dollar ranged between 126.10 yen and 126.37 yen.
   The dollar's slip in early trading followed a similar trend in
New York overnight. The dealers said the dollar was affected by a
rise in a U.S. consumer prices and a remark by Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan that he was disturbed by inflation's
strength, dealers said.
   The Labor Department reported Wednesday that U.S. consumer prices
rose at an annual rate of 7.2 percent in January, fueled by higher
costs for gasoline, poultry, fish, eggs and tobacco.
   Greenspan, in his second day of testimony before the House
Banking Committee, said Wednesday that the Federal Reserve is
determined to resist any rise in inflation this year.
   But Ichiro Ikeda, a trader with Chemical Bank, said trading in
Tokyo was inactive as market players remained on the sidelines ahead
of the three-day weekend.
   ``The dollar moved very little against the yen because there were
no incentives to create a market trend,'' he said.

   The Chamber of Commerce director in Lincoln
City has a message for other coastal Oregon towns trying to lay
claim to the title of Kitefliers' Capital of the World: Go fly one.
   ``What's this I hear (that) Bandon thinks it's the kite flying
capital of the world?'' David Gomberg said Tuesday. ``It's not
enough to put a couple of kites in the air and call yourself the
Kite Capital of the World. You're going to have to prove it.''
   ``I suggest this be resolved the way it's done in Japan, with
giant battle kites,'' he added. He said the showdown is scheduled
for May 13 and 14.
   That's just fine with Janet and Frank McNew, owners of the
Freestyle Kites store in Bandon, about 150 miles south of Lincoln
City on the southern Oregon coast.
   ``We've been practicing every weekend _ rain, sleet or snow,''
said McNew. ``We're going to go up there and just blow them away.''
   Virgil Sams of Bandon said battle kites can be 10 feet tall and
have lines impregnated with shards of glass to cut the lines of
rival kites.
   Lincoln City Mayor Alice Sim signed a resolution in 1986
designating her city the Kitefliers' Capital, citing its seven miles
of public beaches, numerous kite stores and its location on the
windward edge of the continent at the 45th parallel, halfway between
the Equator and the North Pole.
   Bandon, about 150 miles south of Lincoln City on the state's
southern coast, is one of a number of towns also claiming to be the
true kite capital.The McNews say average winds of more than 15 mph
give Bandon a natural advantage.
   ``The Kite Flying Capital of the World is kind of a mythological
place,'' said Leonard Conover, assistant editor of ``Kitelines''
magazine.
   ``Lincoln City has a fairly legitimate claim, maybe a bigger,
louder claim. But who's to say it's more sincere than Bandon's?''

   Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan didn't mind
settling his high-stakes football bet with Oklahoma Gov. Henry
Bellmon, and he hopes the wager leaves a good taste in Bellmon's
mouth.
   Sullivan said Wednesday he sent Bellmon 12 steaks from the True
Wyoming Beef Co. in Casper to settle a bet on the University of
Wyoming-Oklahoma State University showdown in the Dec. 30 Holiday
Bowl in San Diego. Oklahoma State drubbed Wyoming 62-14.
   ``It was one bet I hadn't counted on losing,'' Sullivan said.
``But I'm happy to have the opportunity to send Henry a `taste of
Wyoming' that he will never forget.''
   Sullivan said he hopes the Cowboys can avenge the loss when they
travel to Oklahoma State this fall. He also said he heard Bellmon
might share his steaks with members of the Oklahoma State team.
   ``Several of them appear to have promising futures in the
professional ranks and we in Wyoming can only hope they pursue those
opportunities before we travel to Oklahoma for our rematch this
fall,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   El Salvador's leftist rebels contend their
offer to lay down their weapons if the government postpones next
month's presidential election and reduces the military gives them a
claim to the moral high ground.
   While rebel attacks back home continued unabated, guerrilla
commanders cast themselves in the role of peacemakers during
meetings this week with Salvadoran politicians at the resort town of
Oaxtepec, 40 miles outside Mexico City.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti Liberation Front left the meeting with
a promise from political leaders to ``consider'' the proposal the
rebels made Tuesday and press the U.S.-supported government for
direct talks.
   The San Salvador government had no immediate reaction to the
proposal, but the Defense Ministry issued a statement Wednesday
calling the rebel proposal a ``sinister'' plan to obtain power ``by
force of arms.''
   If the government rejects talks, which appears likely, the rebels
are bolstered in their claim that government intransigence is to
blame for continuing bloodshed.
   The rebels would then have an excuse for stepped up attacks as
the March 19 elections approach and gain a propaganda tool in their
battle for the hearts and minds of the Salvadoran people.
   Rebel commander Roberto Roca said President Jose Napoleon Duarte
and El Salvador's National Assembly will have to decide quickly or
bear ``the blame for the continuation of the war. The matter is
urgent.''
   The war began in 1980 and has claimed an estimated 70,000 lives,
most of them civilian. At least 27 people died over the last three
days, most of them in guerrilla attacks. Several were innocent
bystanders.
   The rebels have offered to take an indirect role in the
presidential elections, supporting the leftist Democratic
Convergence, which is now running third in polls behind the rightist
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, and Duarte's centrist
Christian Democrats.
   The guerrillas have vowed to respect the outcome if the vote is
postponed and their conditions are met.
   But those conditions would mean sweeping changes in El Salvador's
political and military structure, including large cuts in the armed
forces _ cuts the military has already rejected.
   The armed forces have hinted at a coup if Duarte stays in office
past June 1, the constitutionally mandated end of his term.
   Rebel leaders say they believe their proposal won them
international sympathy and gained them credibility with Salvadoran
political leaders.
   They said the very fact that they sat down with the politicians
for the first time ever was a breakthrough.
   Roca told reporters on Wednesday he believes at least some
politicians left convinced the rebel front genuinely has democratic
aims.
   The rebel offer to end a decade-long ban on participation in
elections, first made in January, has been treated with intense
skepticism by Duarte's government, the military and Arena, which has
little incentive to make concessions because of its electoral lead.
   The rebel leaders insist they are serious about peace _ under the
right conditions. They said Wednesday that the end of the Reagan
administration was a factor in their decision to make a peace offer
in hopes the Bush administration will press the Salvadoran
government to agree to talks.
   The United States has pumped more than $3 billion in military and
economic aid into El Salvador without ending the conflict between
the 56,000-man armed forces and the 7,000 guerrillas.

   About 350 air traffic controllers in Moscow have
been refusing their salaries for more than two months to protest low
wages and outdated equipment, Soviet media reported.
   Initially, all 550 controllers at Moscow's central flight control
installation were involved in the protest, but 200 gave up because,
as the Tass news agency said, ``it is not easy to live without
getting any salary.''
   The official news agency, citing an article in Literaturnaya

modernize control towers and buy new radar equipment.
   It said they want to know what is being done with $56 million in
hard currency they earn the government annually by directing foreign
aircraft to Soviet airports.
   The controllers emphasized that they are not on strike, but are
carrying out a job action to embarrass aviation authorities into
agreeing to raise their pay and upgrade their equipment.

   Salman Rushdie's ``Satanic Verses'' is a dizzying
547-page journey through countless plots, subplots, satire and
philosophical discussions.
   It also is That Book, the work that has so enraged the Islamic
world that the author has been condemned to death. The controversy
has revived age-old questions of censorship and freedom of religion.
   Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and at times bewildering, the
novel deals with preconceptions of good and evil, Britain's
treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to become
assimilated into British culture and, most notably, the birth of the
Islamic faith.
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old Bombay native of Moslem parents, writes in
a stream-of-consciousness style that leaves the reader alternately
exhilarated, bewildered and _ depending on one's religious and
political orientation _ outraged.
   The novel has been condemned by Moslems for its dream sequences
that portray the prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, a coward willing
to compromise his faith for general acceptance and a conniving
businessman who makes up laws to suit his own purposes.
   It also contains a sequence in which a Persian scribe alters the
holy laws as dictated by Mohammed, who is referred to in the book as
Mahound.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought them Allah's
revelations in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   The book prompted Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to put a
price on the author's life, sending Rushdie into hiding, along with
his wife.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' begins with terrorists blowing up a jet en
route to London. Two passengers _ Gibreel Farishta, an Indian actor
who specializes in religious roles, and Saladin Chamcha, a British
radio star able to reproduce a myriad of voices _ fall from the
plane and survive. Rushdie writes:
   ```To be born again,' sang Gibreel Farishta tumbling from the
heavens, `first you have to die. Ho ji! Ho ji! To land upon the
bosomy earth, first one needs to fly. Tat-taa! Taka-thun! How to
ever smile again, if first you won't cry? How to win the darling's
love, mister, without a sigh? Baba, if you want to get born again
...'''
   The two men emerge on an English coast. Gibreel begins to assume
an ``angelic glow,'' while Saladin grows horns and hooves and is
arrested as an illegal immigrant.
   The novel's turning point comes when Gibreel, whose halo dazzles
police, denies to authorities that he knows Saladin. By having
Gibreel commit an evil act wearing a halo and subjecting Saladin to
the brutal treatment of the English police, Rushdie confounds
reality. Which one is evil? Which one is good?
   The book's second, fourth and sixth chapters, ``Mahound,''
``Ayesha'' and ``Return to Jahilia,'' contain the most controversial
elements.
   Gibreel dreams about the city of Jahilia, built entirely of sand.
One of Jahilia's citizens is Mahound, a
``businessman-turned-prophet'' who is starting a new religion.
Unfortunately for Mahound, the city already has 360 gods and little
use for more.
   Mahound's chance for recognition comes when the head of the
city's ruling council proposes a deal: If Mahound's Allah (the
Islamic god) will accept three of the local gods (Lat, Uzza and
Manat) as archangels in his sect, his religion will receive
certification and Mahound will have a seat on the council.
   Mahound, always the practical businessman, sees the deal as a
good opportunity to attract converts. So he climbs a mountain to
consult with the archangel, none other than Gibreel himself. Rashdie
writes of Mahound's moral dilemma:
   ```The souls of the city, of the world, surely they are worth
three more angels? Is Allah so unbending that he will not embrace
three more to save the human race?''
   Although he does not actually hear an answer, Mahound undergoes
what he considers a revelation in the archangel's presence,
believing he should make the deal.
   But he soon learns that the supposedly divine message did not
come from Gibreel but the Devil, who had been impersonating the
archangel. Mahound renounces the satanic ``verses'' and substitutes
these words, which closely follow the spirit of the actual Koran,
about Lat, Uzza and Manat:
   ``They are but names you have dreamed of, you and your fathers.
Allah invests no authority in them.''
   Rushdie takes the story a step further by having Gibreel claim
that both answers came from him, blurring the distinction between
God and Satan.
   Mahound and his followers eventually settle in the ``friendly
oasis'' of Yathrib, just as Mohammed journeyed from Mecca to Medina.
In Yathrib, Mahound proceeds to dictate to the Persian scribe Salman
the rules of the new religion as proscribed by Gibreel.
   However, Salman becomes convinced that Mahound is making up the
rules himself and decides to test his leader by deliberately
changing what is recited to him. The scribe, fearing for his life if
Mahound discovers his trick, flees Yathrib and concludes his part of
the story by stating, ``It's his Word against mine.''
   Rushdie has said his characters ``seek to become fully human by
facing up to the great facts of love, death and (with or without
God), the life of the soul. Outside it, the forces of humanity are
on the march.''

   Is musical variety dead on network television? If
you really want to know, just ask anyone who watched ``The 31st
Annual Grammy Awards'' _ assuming you can wake them up.
   ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' a smile button of a song that
apparently represents the cutting edge of current Western musical
culture, seemed to be the theme of an abnormally dull awards program
Wednesday night. But for viewers of the three-plus hours on CBS, the
operative lyric might have been Tracy Chapman's ``You've got a fast
car, I want a ticket to anywhere.''
   It looked at first as if Chapman might walk off with the show,
but quiet thoughtfulness was not the order of the night, and the
sequin-bedecked proceeding clearly was not her scene. She quietly
accepted her Grammys and ducked off stage, coming back later to sing
her hymn of dead-end poverty, ``Fast Car,'' in front of a crowd
whose aggregate wardrobe pricetags probably equalled the gross
national product of any three Third World nations.
   The show was enlivened only occasionally by performances from
Chapman, Sinead O'Connor, Toni Childs and Melissa Etheridge who
apparently didn't know better than to care.
   Otherwise, it was snore city, though you couldn't tell from the
glitterati, who, perhaps sated with sponsor Pepsi's product, gave
standing ovations at every opportunity, regardless of whether they'd
been regaled by Whitney Houston or Itzhak Perlman.
   Maybe it's something in the water out there in L.A. At least last
year in New York, there was a little creative tension in the air.
Remember Little Richard taking the show hostage when it suddenly
occurred to him, hey, I practically invented rock 'n' roll and I
never got a Grammy? They stuck him in the audience this time around.
   It was also last year that Michael Jackson showed up to rivet the
crowd with his performance.
   If they're going to insist upon televising this thing, somebody
better give the academy some plot advice. Don't put O'Connor,
Etheridge and Childs on stage to sing their hearts out, then give
the award to Tina Turner who wasn't even there.
   Do, however, have venerable old-timers show up kids, and that's
just what lifetime achievement award winners Leontyne Price, Dizzy
Gillespie and Sarah Vaughan did. You won't see this on MTV.
   It was just so hard to pick a trend for the night from the many
possibilities. Perhaps ``Blind Date from Hell.'' The producers
seemed to delight in pairing bizarre presenter couples, such as Kris
Kristofferson and Minnie Pearl, Henry Mancini and Olivia Newton-John
or Steve Winwood and Randy Travis, all of whom had the good sense
not to try to talk to each other.
   But ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' Bobby McFerrin's mindless _ and of
course highly honored song _ did so nicely set off the evening's
too-tired-to-reach-for-the-remote-control sensibility.
   McFerrin was charming, however, when he teamed with host Billy
Crystal on an amusing ``history of music'' that thankfully took up
several minutes of the tedious show. Blues and gospel begat soul,
said Crystal, ``which begat the cover and two-drink minimum.''
   Crystal, for his part, better watch it or he will be that which
he satires. After three years as host of the show, he's becoming
rather smug. Still, he showed himself a pro by turning a faulty
sound system into a routine, and he dished one-liners as if he meant
it. He also dusted off the ol' Sammy Davis Jr. impression to great
effect on Chapman's ``Fast Car.''
   The Grammy Awards do provide something of a smattering of musical
updating for network audiences who might have missed George
Michael's latest or haven't had the pleasure of being exposed to the
smoke, hair and leather of Metallica. The network mandate, after
all, IS public service. And now, thankfully, we're all caught up
until next year.

   After a period of strain over economic relations,
Americans and Japanese see the relationship between their two
nations in a more favorable light, a recent poll has found.
   The survey by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo
Broadcasting System also found that majorities in both countries
agree on the rise of Japanese power and are equally split over
whether U.S. might has declined.
   The results were released Wednesday and published in today's
editions of the Times.
   Of the Americans surveyed, 79 percent described U.S.-Japanese
relations as somewhat or very friendly, up from 72 percent in May
1987. The Times said 68 percent of the Japanese polled said
relations were somewhat or very friendly, up from 43 percent two
years ago.
   In Japan, the Times said the poll found that 77 percent support
the emperor system today, with 73 percent saying they now view the
emperor as a national symbol and only 2 percent saying they still
see him as a god.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. poll found that 63 percent of Americans
believe it is appropriate for President Bush to attend the funeral
of Emperor Hirohito. The Times added, however, that while 66 percent
of people under 30 approved of the trip, it drew approval from only
41 percent of respondents over 64, who would have adult memories of
World War II.
   The poll, based on telephone interviews with 1,060 Japanese
adults on Feb. 16-19, and 1,233 U.S. adults on Feb. 18-19, had a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   On July 4, 1776, Caesar Rodney sent a letter from
Philadelphia to his brother back home in Delaware, mentioning the
Declaration of Independence, which he had just signed.
   Rodney's letter was sold at auction Wednesday for $440,000,
setting world records for the sale of any letter and for an American
autograph, Christie's said.
   Chicago book dealer Ralf Newman bought the letter, addressed to
Capt. Thomas Rodney in Dover, Del., on behalf of a private client,
the auction house said.
   It was estimated before the sale that the letter would bring
$100,000 to $150,000.
   The old record for an American autograph was $396,000 paid in
1987 for a Thomas Jefferson letter, according to Dana Micucci, a
spokeswoman for Christie's.
   A letter from Button Gwinnett of Georgia, another signer of the
Declaration, was sold for $209,000 to Walter R. Benjamin Inc., an
autograph firm in Hunter.
   The Gwinnett letter, dated July 12, 1776, also displays the
autographs of five other signers of the Declaration as members of
the Marine Committee of Congress.
   The letters were part of the Estelle Doheny Collection of rare
books and manuscripts from St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, Calif.,
which Christie's is selling in six parts on behalf of the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles.
   On Tuesday, the first Bible to be printed in America sold for
$330,000.
   The two-day sale _ the fifth of the six parts _ brought in
$4,162,202. That brings the total to date to more than $37 million.
The final part of the sale will be held in May.

   It was, as Willie Dixon put it, about time.
   The 73-year-old blues master won his first Grammy from the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences on Wednesday for the
album ``Hidden Charms,'' which was named best traditional blues
recording.
   Dixon, whose songs have been recorded by the Rolling Stones, Led
Zeppelin, the Doors and many others, was given a standing ovation as
he went to the Shrine Auditorium stage, aided by a cane, to receive
the coveted trophy.
   ``I've been in the music business for 50 years. It's about time,
don't you think?'' said Dixon in his trademark raspy voice. ``Better
late than never.''
   Promoting the blues has been his whole career, Dixon said, and
now he had something to show for it.
   ``I give in and I give out but I never give up,'' he said.
   Dixon had been nominated four times previously and never won.
   Songs written by Dixon include ``I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,''
``I Can't Quit You Baby'' and ``Built for Comfort.''
   The Rolling Stones recorded his ``Little Red Rooster'' and ``I
Want to be Loved,'' and Rod Stewart performed his ``Good Morning,
Little Schoolgirl.''
   The Doors recorded ``Back Door Man,'' and Cream had a hit with
Dixon's ``Spoonful.''
   One of 14 children, Dixon was born in Vicksburg, Miss. and raised
in both Vicksburg and Chicago. He won the Golden Gloves amateur
heavyweight boxing title as James Dixon in 1936, then became a
professional musician based in Chicago the next year.
   Among other blues giants Dixon played with or wrote for during
his long career were Elmore James, Otis Rush, and Memphis Slim. He
also worked as an artist and repertoire man, producer and writer for
Chess Records in the early 1950s.
   Dixon's competitors for the Grammy were Johnny Copeland for
``Ain't Nothing But a Party,'' James Cotton for ``Live at Antone's
Nightclub,'' Rockin' Dopsie for ``Saturday Night Zydeco'' and Guitar
Slim Jr. for ``The Story of My Life.''

   All that remains of civil rights
pioneer W.E.B. Du Bois' childhood home is ``a cellar hole'' marked
by a plaque, but a group meeting on his 121st birthday today wants a
more prominent tribute.
   ``It is in stark contrast to Paul Revere's house, Faneuil Hall in
Boston and other places that are national landmarks,'' said Robert
Paynter, a University of Massachusetts archaeologist excavating the
homestead.
   At a university luncheon commemorating Du Bois' birthday, state
Secretary of Economic Affairs Grady Hedgespeth was to announce a
study for a memorial at the plot of land, which has been listed with
the National Register of Historic Places.
   Du Bois, a social scientist, helped found the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and is revered in
Africa as the father of black nations.
   School officials said the state has promised a grant to study
ways to create a bigger tribute to him. The memorial would be at the
site of Du Bois' childhood home in Great Barrington, which today is
``a cellar hole in the woods,'' Paynter said.
   Scholars have long lamented the lack of homage paid to the man
who laid the foundation for Pan-Africanism and planted the seeds for
the independent African nations that sprang up in the 1960s.
   ``The irony is that he is better known internationally than in
America,'' said university Afro-American studies Professor William
Strickland.
   Du Bois spent his final years in Ghana, which has turned his
bungalow into a national shrine. Among guests scheduled to attend
today's birthday luncheon was Victor Gbeho, Ghana's missionary to
the United Nations.
   For four years after his birth in 1868, Du Bois lived in the
Great Barrington house, which archeologists believe had been in his
mother's family for a century. The long history of the black
Burghardt clan from which Du Bois is descended is lovingly detailed
in his autobiographies.
   The house was purchased by friends as a 60th birthday gift in
1928, and Du Bois used it as a summer retreat for more than 25
years. He sold it because of financial and political pressures.
   He had been under government surveillance since 1919 for his
writings on black rights, and in the 1950s his passport was taken
away. Embittered, he toured Eastern Bloc capitals, and in 1961 he
moved to Ghana and applied for membership in the Communist Party.
   The University of Massachusetts arranged for the state to buy the
homestead last year.
   Du Bois admirers bought the property after his death in 1963 and
wanted to preserve it as a memorial, but their efforts were met with
hostility. A 1968 memorial observation there was opposed by veterans
groups and the local Knights of Columbus because of Du Bois'
politics.

<TEXT>
   The formidable task of ending 10 years
of jungle war in Cambodia moves on to other arenas, including the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years, now that peace talks held in
this country have broken up without new agreements.
   Despite the bare results at Jakarta this week, attempts at
rapprochment by the United States, China and the Soviet Union and
unprecedented recent dialogue among the warring Cambodian factions
have created momentum toward peace.
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach of Vietnam said it was ``like
the last 15 minutes of a football (soccer) match, with everyone
trying to score a point.''
   Prince Norodom Ranariddh, a leader of guerrillas fighting
Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia, said the Jakarta meeting had been
destined to fail because settlement lies with two countries that did
not attend _ the Soviet Union, which arms Vietnam, and China, which
arms the guerrillas.
   The Cambodian conflict is likely to top the agenda when Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev meets Chinese leaders in Beijing on
May 15-18 in the Communist giants first summit in three decades.
   The two nations have declared their commitment to settling the
major conflict blocking normalization of their relations.
   Indeed, officials fear Moscow and Beijing might rush into an
agreement that, as in Afghanistan, would wash their own hands but
leave basic internal conflicts unresolved and condemn Cambodia to
even more chaotic civil war.
   Last year, the two powers held their first talks solely on the
Cambodia issue. Then in December, China's Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen discussed it in Moscow in the first visit by a top Chinese
official there in 31 years.
   In February, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze made his
country's highest-level visit to China in three decades to set the
date for the summit.
   During the Shevardnadze visit, the two countries reached broad
agreement on many aspects of the Cambodian problem. But a joint
statement also cited their differences over what is also the major
disagreement between the respective Cambodian adversaries they
support.
   Beijing came out in support of the guerrillas' call for formation
of a provisional coalition government that would comprise the three
guerrilla groups and the pro-Vietnamese Cambodian government.
   But Moscow backed the Phnom Penh government's offer of a
four-party provisional body that apparently would be charged only
with implementing a peace agreement and organizing a general
election.
   Persistent but unconfirmable reports say the Soviets _ seeking
better relations with China and the non-communist Southeast Asian
nations and an end to costly foreign military involvements _ have
been pressuring Vietnam for a speedier withdrawal and peace talks.
   More obvious have been signs of increased albeit limited Chinese
flexibility in the past year or so.
   Most importantly, Beijing finally has joined the international
community in publicly declaring its opposition to a return to power
of its main guerrilla ally, the Khmer Rouge.
   China's once unequivocal support for the group _ which murdered
hundreds of thousands of people when it ruled Cambodia from 1975
until Vietnam's late 1978 invasion _ had blocked peace efforts for
years.
   After a decade of dismissing all Vietnamese attempts at
high-level dialogue, Beijing held talks on Cambodia in January with
Vietnam's First Deputy Foreign Minister Dinh Nho Liem. The parties
informally agreed that Vietnam would withdraw its troops by
September in exchange for an end to Chinese aid to the guerrillas.
   There is the prospect of a meeting soon between the Chinese and
Vietnamese foreign ministers.
   The United States, which provides the resistance with diplomatic
support and non-lethal aid, also has been more active in discussing
ways to settle the conflict in talks with the Soviet Union and with
China.
   President Bush is expected to discuss the issue when he visits
China this weekend. A group of 31 U.S. congressmen has written Bush
a letter asking that he urge the Chinese to halt aid to the Khmer
Rouge.
   Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, a signatory and the influential chairman
of the House subcommittee on Asian affairs, calls blocking a Khmer
Rouge return ``one of the major political and moral challenges'' of
the new administration.
   The Chinese in turn may press Washington to increase aid to the
non-communist guerrilla groups, the forces of Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and of Son Sann.
   A statement from participants at the Jakarta talks urged the
Cambodian factions to engage in dialogue until the next such talks
can be arranged.
   Their antagonism in Jakarta, however, has dimmed prospects that
the Cambodians will make progress in talks among themselves. Three
rounds of talks between the principal leaders of the two sides,
Sihanouk and Premier Hun Sen of the pro-Vietnamese government, have
sharpened mutual recriminations.

   The pilot of an Air Force cargo jet
that crashed, killing all eight people on board, was trying to land

   The C-141B Starlifter from Norton Air Force Base, Calif., went
down Monday night amid heavy thunderstorms about four miles short of
Hurlburt Field's main runway in Florida's panhandle.
   Officials have not determined the cause of the crash, but
Hurlburt spokeswoman Victoria Hanson said the pilot was relying on
cockpit instruments. Ground radar is the favored method in bad
weather.
   A team of safety investigators arrived Wednesday at the crash
site in a heavily wooded swamp on neighboring Eglin Air Force Base's
military reservation about 40 miles east of Pensacola. Ms. Hanson
said a final report could take three to four months.
   Searchers, meanwhile, found two more bodies Wednesday. The
remains of four people were discovered Tuesday, and the search for
the final two bodies was to continue today. The remains were taken
to Eglin for identification.
   The crash site was on a remote portion of Eglin's 720-square-mile
military reservation used for weapons testing and maneuvers.
   The four-engine transport had departed Monday morning from Norton
and stopped in Colorado Springs, Colo., en route to Hurlburt. It had
a crew of seven and had picked up a passenger, retired Air Force
Capt. John G. Galvin of Jacksonville, during the refueling stop in
Colorado, Ms. Hanson said.
   The crew members were identified as Capt. Mark J. Chambers, 30;
Capt. John F. Young, 30; Master Sgt. Robert E. Wright Jr., 37; Tech.
Sgt. Ronald D. Grubbs, 29; Staff Sgt. Karl M. Kohler, 32; Airman 1st
Class Scott Craig, 22, and Staff Sgt. John W. Remerscheid, 33.

   A 12-year-old Armenian girl whose forehead was
crushed in the devastating earthquake that shook the Soviet republic
has been released from a hospital after reconstructive surgery made
possible through a U.S. program.
   Gayane Gasparian, one of four children being treated at
Massachusetts General Hospital, was released Wednesday and joined
her mother at an apartment paid for by the city.
   The lanky, dark-haired girl was among 37 children and their
guardians flown in Feb. 9 by the Virginia-based organization Project
HOPE after the Dec. 7 earthquake in which 25,000 people were killed
and 500,000 were left homeless.
   ``At least 10 are outpatients now and many more are slowly coming
out,'' said Martha Desrosiers, the organization's director of
humanitarian assistance. ``In general, they are all adapted and
happy. Some of them are still frightened, but some are speaking
English.''
   Miss Gasparian's surgery was a week ago, and Dr. Michael
Yaremchuk said the girl will spend several days recuperating before
beginning a series of operations on her hand, which was also smashed.
   He said it was unlikely any of the other three children under
treatment in Boston would be released soon.
   ``Their spirits are good but they all have very difficult
problems,'' Yaremchuk said. ``Our reconstructive efforts won't bring
them back to normal but we can approach that as our goal.''
   Many of the reconstructive operations were complicated by the
delay in treatment following the disaster, Yaremchuk said.
   ``If a similar injury had occurred in the United States, the
reconstruction would have been as soon as possible after the
accident,'' he said. ``But the priorities are different in a crisis
situation.''
   The other children were treated at hospitals in Illinois,
Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, Florida and Ohio.

   Miami International Airport has joined several other
major U.S. airports in installing an anti-terrorism device capable
of detecting bombs similar to the one that destroyed Pan Am Flight
103, an airport spokesman said.
   The $770,000 decompression chamber guards against barometric
bombs, detonated by pressure changes at high altitudes, said airport
spokesman Chris Mangos. It is the first such device to be installed
in Florida, he said.
   If such a bomb is hidden in the cargo or luggage, it will explode
within the thick concrete walls of the chamber, Mangos said
Wednesday.
   Miami International officials built the narrow 89-foot-long
chamber at the insistence of Israel's El Al Airlines, known for its
strict security measures.
   Los Angeles International Airport, O'Hare International Airport
in Chicago and New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, all serviced by
El Al flights, already have decompression chambers.
   ``Our utmost concern is to take care of our customers and make
sure they are safe and sound in our planes,'' said David Shein, El
Al's general manager for North and Central America.
   El Al said it may double its cargo business out of Miami, but had
agreed to proceed with expansion plans only if the chamber was
installed to deal with security threats, Shein said.
   Investigators think a barometric bomb was used to blow up Pan Am
Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December, killing all 259
people on board and 11 on the ground.

   In a sudden switch, Barbara Bush has decided not to
speak out on such controversial subjects as abortion and gun control
after an apparent difference with President Bush over whether
military-style assault rifles should be outlawed.
   The first lady's decision was disclosed today by her press
secretary, Anna Perez, as Mrs. Bush arrived in Tokyo with her
husband to attend the funeral of Emperor Hirohito on Friday.
   Ms. Perez said Mrs. Bush had adopted a new policy on
controversial issues such as guns and abortion.
   ``She will not discuss them,'' the spokeswoman said. ``They are
not the issues where she wishes to have a focus. It doesn't mean she
doesn't have a right to an opinion. It means she has a right to
discuss them or not.''
   Ms. Perez said the first lady has decided instead to highlight
such concerns as the homeless, AIDS and illiteracy.
   Mrs. Bush and the president appeared at odds after she said in an
interview with The Associated Press that she ``absolutely'' favors
banning military-style assault weapons such as the one used recently
in a schoolyard massacre in Stockton, Calif., in which five children
were killed and more than two dozen children were wounded.
   The president, questioned separately, said he does not believe
semiautomatic weapons should be banned because they are used by
sportsmen and hunters. A semiautomatic AK-47 was used in the
Stockton incident.
   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, the
nation's biggest gun lobby, said police should do more to enforce
existing gun laws.
   Ms. Perez quoted the first lady as saying ``there isn't that much
of a difference of opinion'' between her and the president over the
issue of outlawing assault-style weapons.
   ``If there is, they will discuss it among themselves,'' Ms. Perez
said.
   The press secretary said Mrs. Bush does not want her views to be
the focus of attention.
   ``She's not the one that makes policy,'' Ms. Perez said. ``She
doesn't lobby Congress. She's not the president.''
   Reflecting Mrs. Bush's views, Ms. Perez said, ``The opinions that
are important, that require the spotlight, are those of her
husband.''
   Mrs. Bush wore an elegant black suit and her customary strand of
fake pearls today for tea with Naoko Takeshita, wife of Japanese
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   ``How very, very kind of you to invite me,'' said Mrs. Bush as
she greeted Mrs. Takeshita, who wore a navy blue suit.
   They met at the official residence of the Takeshitas, although
the family actually lives in a private home in Tokyo.
   Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Takeshita drank tea and coffee at a marble
table in a small, green-carpeted room decorated with flowers and a
pastel painting of Mount Fuji.
   Mrs. Bush expressed her sympathy over Hirohito's death and Mrs.
Takeshita offered her congratulations on Bush's election as
president, Ms. Perez said.

   The dollar fell against all major currencies in
early European trading today as expectations of higher U.S. interest
rates receded, dealers said. Gold prices were higher.
   Traders said the dollar's gradual decline in recent days
reflected a growing belief that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will
not raise interest rates.
   Higher interest rates would make the dollar a more attractive
investment.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.33 Japanese yen to a closing 126.29 yen. Later, in
London, it fell further to 125.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.8252 West German marks, down from 1.8380
   _1.5565 Swiss francs, down from 1.5667
   _6.2295 French francs, down from 6.2625

   _1,344.75 Italian lire, down from 1,350.50
   _1.1940 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1965
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7565 from $1.7465 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $388 a troy ounce, up
from $386.30 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning today, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $389.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $389.15, up from $386.25 bid late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.99 to close at a bid $389.50.
   Silver bullion was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.97 a
troy ounce, unchanged from Wednesday's late bid.

<TEXT>
   About 100 radical students battled riot
police with firebombs and rocks and burned an effigy of President
Bush today despite stern warnings against violent anti-government,
anti-U.S. protests.
   The students from Chungang University fought running battles with
police for 40 minutes in front of the Seoul school. They also burned
an effigy of President Roh Tae-woo before dispersing.
   ``Punish Chun Doo-hwan and oust Roh Tae-woo!'' the students
shouted.
   Chun Doo-hwan, Roh's predecessor, stepped down last February and
is under acute criticism for corruption and misdeeds during his
seven-year administration.
   The United National Democratic Movement, an umbrella organization
for more than 200 dissident groups, said it is planning major
anti-American rallies on Monday, when Bush comes for a five-hour
visit.
   Bush arrived today in Tokyo for Emperor Hirohito's funeral and is
scheduled to stop in Seoul en route to Washington after visiting
China. In Seoul, he will meet with Roh and deliver a speech to the
National Assembly.
   Police were expected to enforce tight security as radical groups
announced plans to use the occasions to promote their
anti-government and anti-U.S. causes.
   Today's clash followed Roh's warning that he would not tolerate
further acts of violence in order to ``establish law and order at
any cost.''
   In a meeting with governing party officials, he reaffirmed a
government plan to clamp down on the protests beginning this weekend.
   Roh warned that radical groups are trying to overthrow the
government through revolutionary means. He said the government and
society must be prepared to fight the radicals.
   The warning, Roh's second in less than two weeks, came as the
nation's largest dissident organization prepared nationwide protest
rallies on Saturday, the first anniversary of Roh's presidential
inauguration.
   Last weekend, police mobilized 24,000 trooops to thwart two major
anti-government rallies in Seoul and detained 2,500 workers and
students. They said demonstrations by students, farmers, workers and
dissidents were banned.
   On the day Bush arrives, dissidents said they would defy stage
major anti-American demonstrations in front of the U.S. Embassy and
military installations in Seoul and other parts of the country.
   In the southern city of Kwangju today, police formally charged
two radical students with arson for allegedly setting fire to a
provincial governor's residence with firebombs.
   Police said they were looking for 23 more students believed to
have taken part in the burning Wednesday. Nobody was hurt in the
attack.
   The radical blame the United States for the continued division of
the Korean peninsula and want the 42,000 American troops stationed
in their country under a mutual defense treaty to be removed.

   A city councilman leaped from his seat during a
meeting and engaged in a scuffle with an attorney who he said called
him ``yellow and a coward.''
   Councilman Al Gonzalez marched into the gallery during
Wednesday's meeting, stunning Mayor Annette Strauss and the rest of
the council, and began swinging at attorney Domingo Garcia.
   Security guards quickly separated the two men after Gonzalez
threw some punches at Garcia.
   ``I'd heard he'd been saying things about me, calling me yellow
and a coward, and saying I wouldn't stand up for what's right,''
Gonzalez said. ``There's nothing in the city charter that says I
have to take that. If he attacks me personally, I just don't have to
take it.''
   Garcia, who didn't return the punches, said he would not file
charges against Gonzalez, who has been criticized by Hispanic
community for refusing to endorse any Hispanics for the next council
elections.
   ``There was a political disagreement but it doesn't call for him
to act in this manner,'' Garcia said.

<HEAD>Government Bows To Pressure From War Veterans On Lowering Flag</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Outraged war veterans forced the
government to back down today on its decision to fly the national
flag at half-staff over the Australian War Memorial during Friday's
funeral in Japan for Emperor Hirohito.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke intervened after a wave of protest from
war veterans, who inundated radio talk shows with protests of plans
to lower the flag on all government buildings in respect for the
late emperor.
   Hawke said he was aware of the sensitivities of war veterans and
their families and agreed to exempt the War Memorial, which
commemorates all Australians who died in wars.
   ``It's an affront to all those who were killed fighting the
Japanese, to all ex-POWs of the Japanese who were brutally treated
and tortured, and to their widows,'' said Brig. Alf Garland,
president of the Returned Services League, representing some 300,000
veterans of World War II and Vietnam.
   ``It is clear to me that the government is completely out of
touch with public opinion and puts trading relationships with Japan
ahead of the feelings of Australian veterans and war widows,''
Garland said before Hawke intervened.
   The row surfaced as Australia's new Governor-General, Bill
Hayden, flew to Japan to join other foreign dignitaries for the
funeral.
   Many Australians regard Hirohito, who died Jan. 7 at age 87, as
an unrepentant war criminal who died without explaining his war-time
role.
   A government spokesman said flags always are lowered at half-mast
in recognition of any head of state who dies in a country with which
Australia has full diplomatic relations.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that in
recent years flags have been lowered in Australia for three Soviet
leaders and the president of Vietnam.

   They looked out of place as they sat on a hard,
government-issue wood bench in a federal courtroom alongside drug
peddlers and Social Security thieves.
   Tall and trim, the twin brothers in the European gray suits and
silver handcuffs sat in identical positions, right leg slung over
left knee, as they awaited their arraignment on fraud charges.
   Philip and Thomas Noons had been arrested with the FBI and
charged with conspiring to embezzle money from the Federal Savings &amp;
Loan Insurance Corp., for which Philip Noons worked.
   Noons is one of hundreds of officials from the troubled S&amp;L
industry hired to untangle a mess they helped to create. In the
process, officials say, they may have helped to make it worse.
   The case against the Noons brothers is part international
intrigue and part plain ol' bank robbing, prosecutors say.
   The 31-year-old twins, who are British citizens, worked for
Mainland Savings, a thrift that has been declared insolvent and has
been the object of two years' worth of FBI investigation.
   When Mainland failed in 1986, Philip Noons went to work at the
FSLIC, trying to sell all the bad Mainland assets the government
suddenly had inherited.
   Thomas Noons went to work for a real estate firm that had a
contract with FSLIC to dispose of Mainland property.
   They even helped the FBI in its investigation of Mainland.
   On Feb. 8, the same FBI agent who had worked with the two
arrested them on charges of conspiring to embezzle money from the
FSLIC by grossly undervaluing Mainland loans and then selling them
to two Houston companies on behalf of themselves.
   One package of 16 loans was valued by Philip Noons at $1,500 and
sold for $50,000, allegedly with money diverted from another
transaction handled by Noons, prosecutors said. The FSLIC said the
package is actually worth $1.6 million, not $1,500.
   In another case, the brothers allegedly paid $692,821 for a loan
on a shopping center, the FBI said. That loan, which was up-to-date
on its payments, was really worth $4 million, the government
charged. The money to buy it came from a mysterious account in
Britain's Channel Islands called the Unicorn Trust, the FBI said,
and was sent through the Cayman Islands, making it harder to trace.
   Although charged and released on bail, the Noons brothers have
yet to be indicted. The FBI had them arrested out of concern they
might flee the country.
   The case is just ``one facet broken off that (Mainland)
investigation,'' said assistant U.S. Attorney John Braddock, who has
spent two years on Mainland and anticipates at least two more.
   The brothers' attorney, David Berg, says his clients are
innocent, and that the government has overreacted.
   Berg said some FSLIC employees who helped build the case against
the twins were simply being vindictive, that Philip Noons helped the
government get a good price for the loans, and that the case rests
on only ``the thinnest reed of evidence.''
   ``I really think these guys are being victimized by ex-employees
at Mainland,'' the attorney said. ``And I think there is a great cry
and hue to expose S&amp;L scandal and so we got this rush to judgment. I
think the government simply jumped the gun on this one.''

   Reversing itself, a prominent
publishing house said today it will publish the German-language
edition of ``The Satanic Verses,'' whose author is the target of an
Iranian assassination order.
   The Kiepenheuer und Witsch publishing house of Cologne said
Salman Rushdie's novel, which many Moslems consider blasphemous,
will appear some time in the fall after it is translated from the
English.
   The publishing house last week said it would not publish the
novel because it feared reprisals against its employees. But the
union of West German writers and other cultural institutions
appealed for the book to be published, saying free speech should not
be compromised by terrorist threats.
   Though Kiepenheuer und Witsch owns the German-language rights to
``The Satanic Verses,'' brief excerpts from the book have been
appearing in the leftist West Berlin newspaper Tageszeitung.
   A spokesman for the Union of West German Publishers, Klaus Kluge,
said the newspaper's move was unauthorized and could result in legal
action by Kiepenheuer und Witsch.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's fundamentalist patriarch,
nine days ago ordered Moslems to seek out and kille Rushdie and the
book's publishers.
   Several Iranian clerics have since put a price on the head of the
British author, who was born to a Moslem family in India and is now
in hiding.

   Aldo Joseph Jacuzzi, the head of a
family company whose whirlpool bath became a symbol of indulgence in
the 1970s, has died. He was 67.
   The chief product of the Jacuzzi Brothers Inc. became virtually
synonymous with hot tubs _ ``jacuzzi'' is listed in Webster's New
World Dictionary _ and a symbol of the Southern California lifestyle
during the disco era and into the 80s.
   In 1954, Jacuzzi Brothers developed a hydro-massage unit to treat
a relative who was an invalid. This unit developed into the
whirlpool that propelled hot-tub waters of the affluent around the
world.
   Jacuzzi Brothers was formed in 1915 when the family bought a
machine shop. Its first major product was the ``toothpick''
propeller adapted for airplanes during World War I. After developing
the nation's first cabin-style monoplane in 1920, the company
abandoned the aircraft business when a relative died testing an
airplane. The family then concentrated the development of the
Jacuzzi injector pump used to propel water in the whirlpool bath.
   Aldo Jacuzzi joined the family company in Berkeley, Calif., in
1939. He held several positions there until the international
headquarters was moved to Little Rock, Ark., in 1963.
   Jacuzzi was named vice president in charge of purchasing and held
that post until 1970 when he was appointed chairman.
   In 1979, the family sold the business to Kidde Inc. of Saddle
Brook, N.J., which was acquired in 1987 by Hanson Industries, the
United States arm of a British corporation.
   The Little Rock company continues to be operated under the name
Jacuzzi Brothers.
   Jacuzzi, who died Tuesday, is survived by his wife, Granuccia
Amadei Jacuzzi, and two sons. The funeral is Friday.

<TEXT>
   Algerians voted today on a new
constitution that would open the way to a multi-party system,
protect civil liberties and spell the end of two decades of
socialism.
   Polling booths opened at 8 a.m. for 12 hours of voting by this
North African nation's 13 million eligible voters, who were casting
ballots for the third time in less than four months.
   Voters overwhelmingly adopted a first set of political reforms in
November, and in December they re-elected President Chadli
Bendjedid, 59, to a third five-year term.
   Bendjedid's proposal to change the constitution is the highlight
of a process of political and social reform under way since a week
of bloody riots in October.
   The unrest was largely blamed on the oil-producing nation's
struggling economy, jolted by a world oil glut and straitjacketed by
the one-party socialist state.
   While Algerian voters are expected to overwhelmingly approve the
constitution, there have been only limited public calls on its
behalf. The ruling party has remained prudently silent.
   Islamic groups have been divided over the merits of the new
document. In an interview published Wednesday in the daily Horizons
said, Ali Bel-Hadj, a leader of a fundamentalist faction, said, ``If
(ethnic) Berbers, communists and all the others have a voice,
Algeria will become a field of ideological confrontations in
contradictions with the beliefs of the Algerian people.''
   The proposed constitution does not overtly authorize competing
political parties to replace the ruling National Liberation Front,
currently the only legal political organization in this nation of 25
million people. But it does recognize ``the right to create
associations of a political character.''
   It also guarantees freedom of expression and the right to strike,
within some limits.
   The new constitution would restrict the power of the army to
defending the ``national independence, the unity and territorial
integrity of the country.''
   Under the current document, the army had a role in ``the
development of the country and the building of Socialism.''
   Also dropped is a declaration that ``the Algerian state is
socialist.'' The new text contains no reference at all to socialism.
   Islam would remain the state religion and Arabic the official
language.
   The proposed document would supercede the 1976 constitution drawn
up under Houari Boumedienne, Marxist president from 1965-78.
   For years, Bendjedid has quietly moved Algeria away from orthodox
socialism to a free market economy but has faced determined
resistance from the ruling party and the government bureaucracy.
   The October riots, in which government offices were a main
target, quickened the process. Officials said 176 people died in the
fighting, but the figure was widely considered low.
   A Nov. 3 referendum that dealt with the separation of powers
between the president, prime minister and National Assembly, or
parliament, was approved by 92 percent. Bendjedid was re-elected
Dec. 23 with 81 percent of the vote.

<TEXT>
   Investigators probing the explosion of Pan
Am Flight 103 have eliminated all but 25 to 30 names from the list
of passengers with baggage that could have contained the bomb, a
newspaper reported today.
   The Syracuse Post Standard reported that a U.S. official, which
it didn't identify, made the disclosure but did not name the
passengers.
   About 49 of the 259 passengers and crew members aboard the Boeing
747 that crashed into the Scottish town of Lockerbie Dec. 21 boarded
in Frankfurt, West Germany, where Flight 103 originated. All aboard
the plane were killed, as well as 11 people on the ground.
   Scottish police last week released a photograph of the bag that
contained the bomb, believed to have been hidden in a radio cassette
player. Authorities said the baggage likely originated in Frankfurt.
   Most of the luggage from Germany had been placed in an aluminum
baggage container that was loaded into the front cargo hold on the
left side of the aircraft.
   Investigators know which container carried the bomb but have not
pinpointed the suitcase. The containers hold between 40 and 50 bags.
   The newspaper's source said Scottish authorities, who are being
assisted by U.S. and German experts, have reduced the list further
through background checks and other efforts.
   In Lockerbie, Police Inspector John McLean would not comment on
the investigation.

<HEAD>Florida Infant Who Received Rare Liver-Intestine Transplant Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 16-month-old Florida boy who underwent a
rare liver and small intestine transplant on New Year's Eve died
from a combination of medical problems involving multiple organ
failures, officials said.
   Calvin Oliveira died Wednesday at University of Wisconsin
Hospital and Clinics, where the surgery was performed, said
spokeswoman Greer Sutter.
   Dr. Munci Kalayoglu, who performed the historic liver-intestine
transplant, said the problems were triggered by respiratory failure.
   ``He's been really sick and basically failing the last two weeks
despite everything we could think of to do for him,'' said Dr.
William Perloff, head of the hospital's intensive care unit. ``In
the last 72 hours, he took a significant turn for the worse.''
   Kalayoglu said doctors ``undertook the operation in an effort to
save Calvin's life and unfortunately we were unable to succeed
despite our best efforts.''
   Calvin, from Deerfield Beach, Fla., gained national attention
after his father, Carlos Oliveira, made a tearful plea to Florida
Gov. Bob Martinez for help in saving the boy's life.
   Money for the down payment on the operation was quickly raised
from private and corporate donors.
   Only 5 percent of Calvin's intestine worked at birth. The
intravenous feeding that kept him alive caused his liver to
deteriorate so severely by December that his only hope was the
experimental operation.
   Kalayoglu had expected Calvin to be able to use the new intestine
and go off intravenous feeding a few weeks after the operation, but
a mysterious lung ailment developed.
   Kalayoglu said Calvin had been the only survivor of five children
who underwent the operation.

   Pro-Iranian captors of three American
educators today threatened to take revenge against Salman Rushdie,
the publishers of his novel ``The Satanic Verses'' and their
supporters for insulting Islam.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine delivered the
threat in a hand-written statement accompanied by an instant
photograph of American hostages Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and
Jesse Turner.
   The group did not directly threaten the hostages, who appeared in
a photograph released with the document to prove its authenticity.
   The Arabic-language statement, delivered to the office of a
Western news agency in Moslem west Beirut, threatened to ``take
revenge against all those who took part in strong and ferocious
campaigns against Islam.''
   In the photograph, shows the three bearded hostages from the
knees up sitting on what appeared to be a bed and looking straight
into the camera.
   Polhill's left arm and hand are noticeably thinner than in a
picture released 14 months earlier, and his left sleeve appears to
have intentionally been hiked up to the elbow to show the arm.
   The document said the revenge would cover ``all institutions and
organizations that insulted in one way or another'' members of
prophet Mohammed's family, meaning Moslems.
   European governments have recalled their ambassadors from Iran to
protest Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's decree last week that Moslems
seek out and kill Rushdie and his publishers because ``The Satanic
Verses'' blasphemes Islam.
   Authors have led demonstrations of outrage at the threat from
Iran's fundamentalist patriarch, who has refused to accept Rushdie's
apology, and President Bush has called the threat an insult to the
civilized world.
   Rushdie, a naturalized Briton who was born a Moslem in India, is
in hiding with his wife in Britain and reportedly under police
guard. Iranian clerics have offered $5.2 million for Rushdie's
murder.
   Steen, Polhill and Turner were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the
campus of the American-affiliated Beirut University College, where
they held teaching posts. Steen, 49, of Boston, taught journalism,
while Polhill, 54, of New York, was assistant professor of business
and Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, taught mathematics and computer
science.
   The three are among 15 foreigners missing and believed held
hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. Nine of
the hostages are American, including Associated Press chief Middle
East correspondent Terry Anderson, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985
and is the longest held.
   ``Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had persistently
sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages' issue, in
accordance with its principles and to show its good intentions in
light of international detente,'' the statement said.
   ``But it seems that imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslems
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the
price of living in the shadow of international detente.''
   The Beirut newspaper an-Nahar today said efforts to free foreign
hostages in Lebanon have suffered now that Iran and the 12 European
Economic Community nations are at loggerheads over Iran's death
threat against Rushdie.
   Jihad threatened to strike against American and Israeli interests
for supporting Rushdie and his novel and called on ``Moslems all
over the world to stand against the laws of the jungle so that
advocates of these laws would realize that real human values ... lie
in spiritual religions and not in the jungle's system.''
   It described Rushdie's book and the support it has as ``the worst
type of insult against Islam's sacredness.''
   The book was part of ``serious and wide-ranging programs underway
to strike against Islam because it is the force that fights moral
and humanitarian degeneration,'' the statement claimed.
   Many Moslems say Rushdie's book blasphemes Islam by portraying
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,
the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.
   In Beirut, reactions to Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' have
been slow and conflicting. An advisor to the Sunni Moslem grand
mufti rejected Iran's ruling while the highest Shiite Moslem
religious judge advocated the death sentence.

<HEAD>Pioneer in Sanitary Engineering Dies at Age 96</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abel Wolman, a Johns Hopkins University sanitary
engineer who helped to bring safe drinking water to millions of
people around the world, has died at age 96.
   Wolman, who died at his home Wednesday, collaborated 70 years ago
with the late chemist Linn H. Enslow to develop a method of
purifying drinking water with precise amounts of chlorine.
   ``It's still the primary water treatment used today,'' said Jared
L. Cohon, vice provost for research at Johns Hopkins University.
``It's in use throughout the world. That's a remarkable thing to
say.''
   The concept of chlorinating water was not new when the two men
developed their formula in 1918, but the technique had yet to be
refined to take into account the bacterial content in a particular
water source.
   The formula specified how much chlorine should be mixed with a
given source of water, taking into consideration the bacterial
content, the acidity and other factors related to the water's
desired taste and purity.
   Wolman had an unconventional willingness to discard Western
assumptions in his role as a clean-water consultant to about 50
countries. His approach was to weigh unique aspects of each
community's water problems: cultural barriers, bureaucratic inertia
and resistance to change.
   He received the National Medal of Science from President Ford in
1975. In 1976, he shared the Tyler Ecology Award, a $150,000 prize,
with two other scientists.
   Wolman was born in Baltimore on June 10, 1892, the fourth of six
children of Polish immigrants. He received bachelor's degrees in
both arts and science from Johns Hopkins and joined the faculty in
1921. In 1937 the university awarded him an honorary doctorate in
engineering.
   He advised the U.S. Public Health Service, the Tennessee Valley
Authority, the Atomic Energy Commission and the World Health
Organization.
   Wolman is survived by his son, M. Gordon Wolman, chairman of the
department of geography and environmental science at Johns Hopkins,
and four grandchildren.

   State Rep. David Duke, the former Ku Klux
Klan leader elected to the Louisiana Legislature, promised to
concentrate on the state's financial problems now that efforts to
bar him from office have failed.
   But at his inaugural session of the state House of
Representatives on Wednesday, Duke heard warnings from black
lawmakers that he will be under close scrutiny.
   ``I'm here to put you on notice that not only black folks here in
Louisiana, but black folks all over he country will be watching
you,'' said Rep. Diana Bajoie of New Orleans.
   ``We are resolved and committed to make sure that racism will not
become the order of the day,'' Rep. C.D. Jones of Monroe.
   Two black legislators walked out as Duke was sworn in.
   Duke, 38, a former grand wizard of the Klan, left the group in
1980 but remains president of the National Association for the
Advancement of White People, which he describes as a civil rights
group for everyone.
   He beamed and waved before taking the oath of office,
administered by House Speaker Jim Dimos, to represent a suburban New
Orleans district that is 99.6 percent white.
   ``I want to allay fears that I will be divisive or a problem in
this great body,'' Duke told his new colleagues. ``I truly believe
when we took the pledge of allegiance this morning and we said
justice for all, I believe in that for America.''
   Duke was sworn in after the House turned aside a challenge on the
grounds that he was not a legal resident of the district he
represents. Earlier, state courts rejected a similar attempt to keep
him out.
   In remarks after his swearing in, Duke said, ``I love this
country and I love this state. And I'm anxious for the media to go
away and to get down to solving Louisiana's problems.''
   Later in the day, Duke met with fellow members of the GOP
legislative caucus to discuss changes in the state's tax system _
the subject of the 15-day special legislative session that convened
Wednesday.
   Duke defeated fellow Republican John Treen in a special runoff
election Saturday. Treen received the backing of President Bush and
former President Ronald Reagan during the campaign.

<HEAD>Flight 103 Relatives Blame Government For Not Issuing Warning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives and friends of Britons who died aboard
Pan Am Flight 103 demanded today that Transport Secretary Paul
Channon resign for failing to alert airport authorities to a bomb
threat against the airline.
   In a letter published in The Independent newspaper, they urged
Channon to ``accept ministerial responsibility'' for failing to pass
on to London's Heathrow Airport a bomb threat reported by U.S.
authorities.
   ``His resignation will not bring back the people we have lost,''
the 22 signatories said. ``It will, however, ease our sense of
betrayal at the actions and omissions of our government.''
   The New York-bound Boeing 747 jet blew up over the Scottish
village of Lockerbie on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and
11 on the ground.
   Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt with a Boeing 727 but
passengers and baggage were transferred to the doomed jumbo jet at
Heathrow.
   The Independent reported last week that Channon's department
received 16 security bulletins last year from the U.S. Federal
Aviation Administration.
   The letter said Channon had given the impression in Parliament
and to the media that the bomb threat against Pan Am ``was one of
such a large number of warnings and, in terms of quality, was so
insignificant, that he saw no need to inform'' Heathrow Airport.
   ``We have since learned that the Americans issue only a small
number of bulletins, and that they considered the bulletin in
question to be one of the most specific to be passed on to the
British government,'' the letter said.
   ``We have been further angered by the fact that the same
information led to the authorities at Frankfurt doubling their own
security,'' it said.
   The State Department said an unidentified person telephoned the
U.S. Embassy in Helsinki, Finland, on Dec. 5 and said an attempt
would be made that month to bomb a Pan Am aircraft flying from
Frankfurt, West Germany, to the United States. The FAA notified the
British government.
   The government said it took no action because it believed
security at British airports was already strict enough.
   British police said last week the bomb was hidden in a
radio-cassette player and probably was loaded onto the plane in
Frankfurt. German police say there is no evidence for such a
conclusion.

   A car thief posing as a car buyer got what he went
after, but he probably didn't know who his victim was.
   Don Byrd, former Dallas police chief and Dallas County sheriff,
says the man got away with a white Porsche 944 Turbo valued at
$26,500.
   Byrd said Wednesday the thief responded to a newspaper ad, came
by and inspected his car and asked for a test drive.
   ``My stepson took him for a test drive, and they came back OK,''
Byrd said.
   He said the man then asked to have the car checked by a mechanic.
Byrd sent his house man to accompany the phony buyer to a Porsche
dealership.
   At the dealership, the house man got out of the car, and when the
mechanic opened the garage door to let the man drive the car inside,
the thief shifted into action.
   ``Instead of driving it forward into the garage, he put it in
reverse, backed to the street and drove away,'' Byrd said.
   It didn't even do the former lawman any good to have the man's
car at his home while the theft was taking place. That car turned
out to have been stolen in suburban Irving, Byrd said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods declined 3 percent in January, the first decrease in four
months and the biggest drop since last July, the government report
today.
   The Commerce Department said demand for durable goods, items
expected to last three or more years, totaled a seasonally adjusted
$128.06 billion in January, down from $132.06 billion in December.
   Orders in virtually all major industry categories were down,
particularly in the volatile transportation and defense categories.
   Much of last month's decline was due to a 7.2 percent fallback in
transportation orders, which had surged 22.1 percent in December due
to high demand for aircraft and autos.
   Excluding transportation, orders in all other categories were
down 1.2 percent last month.
   Overall, orders had been up a robust 7.3 percent in December, the
biggest increase since last June. Orders for all of 1988 had been up
10.9 percent from 1987, the best showing since 1984, as
manufacturers enjoyed an export-fueled rebound thanks to the decline
of the dollar against foreign currencies.
   January's 3 percent decrease was the biggest decline since a 7.4
percent drop last July and the first drop since a 2.8 percent
decrease in September.
   Orders in the erratic defense category, subject to wide swings
depending on when government contracts are signed, plunged 33.5
percent in January after a 24.2 percent increase in December.
   Excluding defense, all other orders were down 0.4 percent after
rising 6.1 percent in December.
   Orders in the key category of non-defense capital goods,
considered a good sign of business intentions to modernize and
expand, were up 1.5 percent to $39.96 billion last month. The
category had increased 9.9 percent in December.
   In other industries, orders for primary metals were down 1.2
percent after a 4.4 percent jump in December.
   Orders for non-electrical machinery were down 0.8 percent after a
1.1 percent increase, and orders for electrical machinery were down
2.3 percent after falling 1 percent in December.
   Shipments of durable goods were unchanged in January at $124.18
billion, following a 3.5 percent increase in December.

<TEXT>
   An explosion early today destroyed a
restaurant and bar for staff members at Bristol University, and news
reports said the blast may have been caused by a bomb planted by
animal rights activists.
   The restaurant and bar were empty at the time and no one was
hurt, but Inspector Don Bond of Avon and Somerset police said the
explosion at the university in western England caused considerable
damage.
   Animal rights militants have mounted an increasingly violent
campaign in Britain in recent years, and there have been past
threats of violence to the university in the port city of Bristol
110 miles west of London.
   The university's medical school carries out experiments on
animals, but the university insists the experiments cause no
suffering to the animals involved.
   ``As yet, we don't know what the cause of the explosion was,''
Bond said.
   The British Broadcasting Corp and the British domestic news
agency Press Association both reported the explosion was proably
caused by a bomb planted by animal rights militants.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the London-based
Daily Mirror, one of Britain's national-circulation tabloids,
reported receiving a telephone call Wednesday saying a bomb was
planted in the university building. The anonymous caller said he was
from a group called the Animal Abused Society and that the bomb
would go off at noon Wednesday.
   Police searched the university building Wednesday morning but
found nothing. The bomb exploded shortly after midnight.
   The restaurant and bar were on the fifth floor of Senate House,
the university's six-story administration block.
   In addition to destroying the restaurant and bar, the explosion
caused extensive damage to rooms in the block, blew out windows over
a wide area and caused considerable structural damage to the floor
immediately above and the floor immediately below, police said. The
entire block was empty at the time.
   Don Carleton, a spokesman at the university, said the
university's computer which is housed in the block may have been
badly damaged. The computer stores everything from research notes to
details of day-to-day operations.
   Bristol University, which was founded in 1909, is a leading
British university with 7,300 students studying subjects ranging
across the academic spectrum from sciences to languages, literature
and other liberal arts.

   A plane carrying 11 people, including a
government minister, crashed into a lake today near the Swiss border
and all aboard were feared dead, officials said.
   The plane, a nine-seat Aerocommander AC-90 from Austria's
Rheinthalflug airline, was preparing to land at Altenrhein just over
the border when it went down, said airline spokeswoman Renatte Moser.
   ``We have to fear that there are dead,'' she told The Associated
Press.
   A spokesman for the federal bureau for civil aviation said he
feared there were no survivors.
   Ms. Moser said the nine passengers included Austria's social
affairs minister, Alfred Dallinger, 62. There were two crew members
on board.
   Rescue boats were on their way to the site of the crash in
Bodensee lake. The aviation official said a wheel and other wreckage
had already been found in Switzerland.
   Swiss police said the plane went down just inside Swiss
territory, but the aviation official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the plane crashed into a part of the lake that is
considered international territory.
   Austrian radio reported the plane, which left Vienna's Schwechat
airport at 9:36 a.m., was scheduled to land at Hohenems in Austria's
westernmost province of Vorarlberg.
   But the plane was not able to land there because of thick fog,
the radio reported. It and the Austria Press Agency said the crash
occurred at 11 a.m.

   Shinto priests purified Emperor Hirohito's resting
place and workers swept leaves off the procession route today on the
eve of the grand state funeral that will virtually shut down this
capital of 12 million people.
   Friday's ancient ceremony for Hirohito _ emperor during a
devastating war and a dazzling economic recovery _ has been
described by Japanese officials as the biggest funeral and the
largest gathering of international leaders in modern times.
   Making his first trip overseas as president, George Bush held a
series of meetings today with several of the 163 heads of state,
royalty and other government representatives scheduled to attend the
daylong funeral.
   Accompanied by his wife Barbara, Bush had lunch with President
Francois Mitterrand of France. Later, Bush met with Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita at the Akasaka Palace.
   Opponents of Japan's imperial system staged at least three
peaceful rallies today, including one with placards that caricatured
and equated Hirohito and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
   The protests by anti-monarchy groups and the possibility of
international terrorist attacks have prompted Japan's largest
security operation.
   Authorities double-checked baggage at airports and restricted the
use of storage lockers in Tokyo's train stations. About 32,000
police were deployed at roadblocks throughout the capital and at
other details.
   Company employees observed a request to refrain from driving to
work today, a self-restraint measure designed to improve security
and control. One police official said traffic was down by 20 percent
to 30 percent on city streets.
   Final preparations today included the sweeping away of leaves
along the route of the funeral procession and purification by nine
Shinto priests of Hirohito's final resting place.
   The newspaper Daily Yomiuri said Hirohito would be entombed along
with more than 100 personal belongings, including a microscope, a
recent list of top sumo wrestlers and a sacred sword. Officials
declined to provide details. Hirohito, a well-known marine
biologist, was a big fan of sumo wrestling.
   Friday has been declared a special national holiday, and while
many Japanese are expected to pay deep respect to Hirohito, who died
of cancer Jan. 7 after a 62-year reign, others planned a ski weekend.
   ``We are having an alternating feeling between joy and
embarrassment,'' said Ritsuko Yamaguchi, an official of a hotel
association in one of central Japan's most popular ski resorts.
   Yamaguchi said hotels and inns were fully booked at Shiga Heights
with more than 30,000 people expected through Sunday. Heavy bookings
were also reported at resorts on the northern island of Hokkaido.
   The funeral is scheduled to begin at 7:30 a.m. Friday (5:30 p.m.
EST Thursday) with a ceremony of farewell at the moated Imperial
Palace in Tokyo and conclude more than 13 hours later with offerings
of food at the mausoleum.
   The foreign dignitaries will join about 3{ hours of the
ceremonies.
   Cloudy, wintry weather is expected with the possiblity of a rare
snowfall and a maximum temperature of 45 degrees.
   The body will be taken by motorcade from the palace to the
Shinjuku Imperial Gardens, where world leaders sitting within two
vast, floor-heated tents will witness a ceremony of ancient Shinto
religious rites and state protocol. The body will then be
transported to the imperial mausoleum on Tokyo's western outskirts,
where Hirohito's father, Emperor Taisho, was buried six decades ago.
   Japan has expressed pride over the unprecedented number of
dignitaries who came, although the event is not without controversy.
   Hirohito's role during Japan's military buildup in the 1930s and
World War II is still a matter of debate _ especially in countries
that suffered the force of Japanese arms during the conflict.
   About 100 opponents of the imperial system carried placards of
Hirohito and Hitler in central Tokyo. Kyodo News Service said 1,500
people protested in the western suburb of Hachioji, where Hirohito
will be buried.
   A representative of a third group of 150 people, which included
older citizens and their families, said: ``We lost our relatives
(during the war) under the name of the emperor.''
   Among the leaders who arrived in Tokyo today were Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, China's Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and
Prince Philip of Britain. Attendance by Philip, husband of Queen
Elizabeth II, caused protests among Brtain's World War II veterans,
one of whom began a hunger strike.
   Bush, by contrast, said it was time to forget the past, noting
that his bomber had been shot down by the Japanese during the war.
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines is also attending,
despite the harsh wartime occupation of her country by the Japanese
_ and rumors of coup plots against her government.
   Emperor Akihito, Hirohito's son and now occupant of the
Chrysanthemum Throne, and Empress Michiko hosted a tea for fellow
bluebloods from 17 countries at the Akasaka residential palace
today. The 55-year-old emperor is expected to be more accessible to
the public than his father.

<HEAD>Teen-Age Girl Killed; Possible Links To Mandela Bodyguards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Police said today that a
13-year-old girl was killed in an attack on a Soweto home that may
be linked to the controversy surrounding Winnie Mandela.
   The killing late Wednesday was the fourth in the past two months
that has involved people connected directly or indirectly to Mrs.
Mandela and her unofficial group of bodyguards known as the Mandela
United soccer club.
   Police said gunmen fired on the house with an AK-47 rifle and set
the dwelling ablaze with a firebomb. The name of the slain girl was
not released.
   A few hours before the attack, an occupant of the house was
detained in connection with the killing last week of Maxwell
Madondo, a member of Mandela United, police said. They declined to
release the name of the person detained.
   ``The possibility that the attack on the house may have a bearing
on the murder of Mr. Madondo and is possibly a revenge attack is
being investigated,'' police headquarters said in a statement.
   Madondo's body, with several stab wounds, was found last week
less than 30 yards from house that was attacked Wednesday. A former
member of Mandela United, Andrew Ekaneng, has been charged with
Madondo's killing but has yet to enter a plea.
   The attack Wednesday is the latest development in the controversy
that centers on Mrs. Mandela and Mandela United members, who lived
at her home in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.
   Anti-apartheid leaders last week accused Mandela United of waging
a ``reign of terror,'' renounced Mrs. Mandela and urged their
followers not to associate with her. Mrs. Mandela's husband, African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, has been imprisoned for 27
years but remains the country's best known black figure.
   In addition to the deaths of the teen-age girl and Madondo, two
other people with links to Mrs. Mandela and her bodyguards have been
killed in recent weeks.
   Stompie Seipei, a 14-year-old activist was allegedly beaten at
the Mandela home by soccer club members. His decomposed body was
found in January, and two members of the soccer club have been
charged with his murder, as well as with the abduction and assault
of three young men.
   Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, a Soweto physician and political activist,
was shot and killed at his clinic last month. Two men have been
charged with the murder, and police have said they believe the
motive was robbery.
   However, there have been unconfirmed reports that on the day
before he died, Asvat examined Seipei, who allegedly had been badly
beaten.
   Mrs. Mandela has suggested that Asvat may have been killed
because he had examined Seipei and other youths who she said were
sexually molested by a Methodist minister in Soweto. Church
officials have denied the charges.

<HEAD>Police Ban University Rally in Support Of Detainees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police today banned a rally at
a university intended to show solidarity with black detainees who
have staged hunger strikes to protest being held without charge.
   More than 300 people, mostly students, had gathered in an
auditorium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg
when police officers entered the hall and said the meeting had been
banned.
   Riot police were deployed in a nearby street, but no disturbances
were reported.
   Student leaders, faculty members and administrators from at least
five universities have fasted for varying periods in support of the
hunger strikers.
   Hundreds of detainees have gone on hunger strikes at several
prisons across the country over the past four weeks to demand that
the government free them or charge them.
   At several prisons, the strikes have been suspended because of a
government pledge to release many detainees. The protests continue
at other prisons, but the police and anti-apartheid groups say they
are not sure how many detainees are involved.
   At least 58 detainees, not all of them hunger strikers, have been
freed since Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok met last week with
anti-apartheid church leaders. Vlok pledged to free ``a substantial
number'' of detainees, and the clergymen called on the hunger
strikers to suspend their fast.
   Vlok says less than 1,000 people are being held under
state-of-emergency regulations, which allow indefinite detention
without trial. Many of the hunger strikers have been held more than
two years.
   The Star newspaper reported today that 17 detainees held under
security legislation at Johannesburg's police headquarters had begun
a hunger strike. Unlike state-of-emergency detainees, prisoners
detained under security laws ostensibly are held in order to be
interrogated.

<HEAD>Simmons Won't Appeal Second Death Sentence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R. Gene Simmons, sentenced to death
after being convicted of killing 14 family members, will not appeal
the sentence, one of his attorneys said.
   ``I talked to Mr. Simmons this morning and he said he has no
desire to appeal this case,'' attorney John Harris said Wednesday.
   Authorities discovered the bodies of Simmons' wife, seven
children, two of the children's spouses and four grandchildren in
and around Simmons' Pope County home on Dec. 28 and 29, 1987.
   Harris said a hearing was scheduled this afternoon for Johnson
County Circuit Judge John S. Patterson to determine whether Simmons
``knowingly and intelligently decided to waive his right to all
appeals.''
   A jury convicted Simmons, 48, in the slayings Feb. 10 and then
sentenced him to death. Patterson set March 16 as the date for
Simmons to die by lethal injection.
   It was the second death sentence for Simmons. He received the
first one last year after a Franklin County Circuit Court jury
convicted him in the shooting deaths of two Russellville residents
in December 1987. The deaths were part of a crosstown shooting
rampage that preceded the discovery of the bodies at Simmons' home.
   Simmons also said after the first conviction that he did not want
to appeal.
   The Rev. Louis J. Franz, chairman of Arkansas Churches for Life,
who argues that appeals should be mandatory in all capital cases,
has intervened in the case.
   Both the Arkansas Supreme Court and U.S. District Judge G. Thomas
Eisele have ruled that Franz did not have legal standing to
intervene. However, Eisele ordered a psychological evaluation for
Simmons and for an independent lawyer to review transcripts of the
trial. That lawyer will advise Simmons of his rights.

   A hidden camera placed in a police station
restroom to catch a vandal has been removed after officers
complained that their privacy had been invaded.
   ``Looking back on it, I wish it hadn't been done,'' police Chief
George Straka said Wednesday.
   On Straka's orders the camera was planted in the ceiling of the
second-story restroom in July 1986. It remained there until officers
learned about it three weeks ago, said Gary Primavera, president of
the Concord Police Officers Association.
   ``A lot of guys feel their right to privacy has been violated,''
Primavera said.
   Detective Ken Bunch said he was shocked when he learned about the
camera.
   `If this were another job _ say Bank of America _ if they put a
camera in a women's bathroom, what do you think the reaction would
be?'' he asked.
   The chief said he had hoped to catch a vandal who plugged a
urinal on several occassions. Water from the clogged urinal flooded
the bathroom and leaked into other rooms on the floor below,
including Straka's office and a computer center.
   No one was caught.
   The association board is investigating possible legal action
against the chief, Primavera said.
   ``In order to do what he did, you would have to get a court
order,'' Primavera said. ``It's like a wire tap. You have to have
probable cause.''

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state law banning marriages between people
of the same sex should be repealed because it discriminates against
homosexuals, says the board of directors of the 8,000-member Bar
Association of San Francisco.
   Banning same-sex marriages was a ``clear denial of equal
protection under the 14th Amendment to the Constitution by singling
out an identifiable class of people,'' association president Peter
G. Keane told a legal newspaper.
   The directors decided unanimously on Wednesday that the current
state civil code mandating marriages between a man and a woman be
changed to read ``marriage is a personal relation arising out of a
civil contract between two people,'' the San Francisco Banner Daily
Journal reported.
   A change would give partners of both homosexuals and
hetereosexuals many of the same rights now only enjoyed by legally
married couples.
   The new definition of marriage is needed to correct ``invidious
discrimination against non-heterosexuals who choose to have a
relationship that has the same quality and definition that a husband
and wife have,'' Keane said.

   Johns Hopkins University President Steven
Muller, one of the nation's longest-serving university presidents,
says he will resign June 30, 1990.
   ``I've made a contribution here,'' Muller told the school's Board
of Trustees on Wednesday. ``I think there are other things I could
do.''
   Muller, Hopkins president for the past 17 years, declined to say
what he will do after he leaves. He was inaugurated as president
Feb. 1, 1972. He was under contract until 1992.
   Muller's ``dynamic and enlightened leadership was instrumental in
moving the university into new and productive areas of education and
research,'' said George Radcliffe, chairman of the board of trustees.
   Muller, 61, had been expected to retire in 1990 after a major
fund-raising drive for the university, and in November, he turned
over day-to-day affairs at Hopkins to the provost and vice
president, John Lombardi.
   Plans to search for a successor have not been finalized, but
Muller said he will help in the process.

<TEXT>
   A group of American doctors on a
humanitarian mission to Vietnam has helped local surgeons operate on
more than 50 children with congenital mouth deformities, a
Vietnamese news report said.
   The surgeons operated to correct cleft lips and palates at the
Olof Palme Institute for the Protection of Children's Health in
Hanoi, the official Vietnam News Agency said Wednesday in a report
monitored in Bangkok.
   The doctors, the first group of American physicians to visit
Vietnam since the communists took power in 1975, traveled there last
week and planned to do reconstructive surgery on 100 children. They
are to stay until Saturday.
   The group, Operation Smile, is based in Norfolk, Va., and is one
of several private, non-profit organizations responding to the U.S.
government's recommendation that Vietnam be given private aid on
humanitarian fields.
   ``When you smile to each other, you'll begin to love another
naturally,'' William Magee, the group's founder, was quoted by the
news agency as saying.
   The United States and Vietnam have no diplomatic relations, but
Washington has encouraged more humanitarian aid since Vietnam
pledged in August 1987 to speed up an accounting of Americans
missing from the war.
   The agency quoted Tran Van Truong, deputy head of the
Odonto-Stomatology Institute, as saying more than 1,000 babies are
born in Vietnam each year with mouth deformities but less than half
are treated. Vietnam is short of plastic surgeons, medical equipment
and facilities, he said.

   President Bush arrived in Japan today and plunged
into a series of mini-summits with Israeli and Arab leaders, as the
United States suggested that new Soviet initiatives in the Middle
East were merely ``rhetorical exercises.''
   Against the backdrop of an imperial Japanese funeral, Bush
conferred with Jordan's King Hussein, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Israeli President Chaim Herzog. Bush pledged that the
United States will take an active role in the search for peace in
the region.
   Reporting on the talks, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
said there were ``perhaps some opportunities out there with respect
to the Middle East peace process that haven't existed before.''
   In particular, Baker noted that the United States has opened
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which Washington
had shunned for years as a terrorist group.
   Baker said Bush did not offer any new U.S. initiatives in the
Middle East.
   On his first overseas journey as president, Bush will attend the
funeral Friday of Japanese Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer Jan.
7 at the age of 87.
   Some nations refused to send a high-level delegation to the
funeral because of Hirohito's role as a leading Japanese figure
during World War II. British veterans protested the decision by
Prince Philip to attend the funeral, and one veteran embarked on a
hunger strike.
   Commenting on Bush's decision to attend, Baker said, ``Maybe it
indicated that the wounds have healed as far as the United States is
concerned.'' Bush fought in the Pacific during World War II as a
Navy pilot whose torpedo plane was destroyed by Japanese gunfire.
   Bush held private talks with a handful of world leaders,
including French President Francois Mitterrand, Portuguese Prime
Minister Mario Soares, Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and
Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan of Thailand.
   It was Bush's talks with Hussein, Mubarak and Herzog that
provided a counterpoint to the 10-day trip through the Middle East
by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who is trying to
advance Moscow's role in the region.
   Baker said ``it's healthy, quite frankly, that the Soviet Union
would be interested in contributing to the cause of peace in the
Middle East.''
   He added: ``I suppose we would want to know that there were
concrete contributions that they have in mind, rather than simply
rhetorical exercises.''
   Challenging Moscow to ``contribute in a concrete way,'' Baker
said the Soviet Union should establish full diplomatic relations
with Israel and ``cease its support of radical countries in the
Middle East region such as Libya.''
   He said Moscow also could exercise influence with Syria.
   Shevardnadze has been promoting the idea of an international
peace conference under the auspices of the United Nations.
   Baker said the United States will continue to insist that any
such conference must lead to direct negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians. He said Jordan also would be ``an appropriate
party in these discussions.''
   After a 16-hour flight from Washington, Bush went directly to the
U.S. ambassador's residence for lunch with Mitterrand. White House
officials said their talks focused on East-West relations, Central
America, the global environment and plans for a seven-nation
economic summit in Paris in July.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and the
French president expressed interest in ``exploring whatever options
might be out there'' in the Middle East.
   The spokesman affirmed Bush's earlier statement that the Soviet
Union should play only a secondary role in the Middle East.
   White House officials said in advance that Bush's meetings with
various world leaders would be brief and lacking in any decisions.
But they were considered significant as the start of Bush's personal
diplomacy as president in search of a Mideast peace strategy.
   ``Although we think there are some opportunities to move the
process forward, we want to be methodical and deliberate,''
Fitzwater said.
   Asked to elaborate, Fitzwater replied, ``I can't be specific
simply because we don't want to talk about any opportunities that
might be there. Things move slowly in the Middle East.''
   However, he said there was ``a changed situation'' because of
U.S. discussions with the PLO and recent statements by its chairman,
Yasser Arafat, who has publicly disavowed terrorism.
   Bush will travel to China on Saturday and make a 4{ hour stop in
South Korea on Monday before returning home.
   ``Things in the Pacific seem to be going reasonably well,'' Bush
said earlier during a refueling stop in Anchorage, Alaska. ``But we
are a Pacific power and this visit will demonstrate that we intend
to stay a Pacific power.''
   Bush said during a pre-trip news conference that he won't be
stampeded into action by Shevardnadze's advocacy of an international
peace conference hosted by the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council.
   In recent days, the Soviet foreign minister has conferred with
Mubarak, Hussein and Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   After his talks with Miterrand, Bush went to Akasaka Palace, the
government guest house. There, in the chandeliered and
marble-columned Room of the Morning Sun, Bush paid a courtesy call
on Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who was the first
foreign visitor to see Bush at the White House.
   In a session stiff with formality, Bush and his six aides were
seated in a straight row of delicate gold chairs opposite their
Japanese counterparts. Two waiters in tuxedos served orange juice in
crystal glasses.
   Fitzwater said Bush told Takeshita that ``Americans express their
respect and sorrow for the emperor.''
   After the funeral on Friday, Bush is to hold talks with leaders
of West Germany, Singapore, Belgium, Turkey, Pakistan and Zaire, and
may meet with Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
   Bush and Mitterrand spent some time exchanging impressions of
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his perestroika program of
economic reforms.
   Fitzwater said they agreed that Gorbachev's agenda provides new
challenges and opportunities to the West. He said they also agreed
that the Western alliance ``was strong, that NATO was in a very
sound and strong position and that the West was ready to deal with
Soviet change in a very positive fashion.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has overturned a murderer's
death sentence because the jury that convicted him 10 years ago had
asked for a Bible and because the trial judge improperly instructed
jurors on the charges.
   Prosecutors can appeal U.S. District Judge Charles A. Moyes'
ruling, agree to a life prison term, or seek a new sentencing
hearing for Brandon Jones, 31, of Chicago, who was convicted of
murder committed during a 1979 service-station robbery. Co-defendant
Van Roosevelt Solomon was electrocuted in 1985.
   Moye, in a ruling handed down Feb. 16, said it was a
``constitutional error'' for jurors to be allowed access to a Bible
during deliberations. He said the jury ``had a duty to apply the law
of the state of Georgia ... not its own interpretation of the law or
its own interpretation of precepts of the Bible.''
   Moye also ruled that former Cobb Superior Court Judge Luther
Hames didn't instruct the jury about the difference between armed
robbery and burglary, and that the jury wasn't fully informed about
the definition of aggravated murder.
   Prosecutors have 30 days from Moye's ruling to decide what
they'll do.

   Actress Joan Woodbury, who
starred in dozens of low-budget films before turning to local stage
productions, has died at her home at age 73.
   Miss Woodbury, who was married to actor and radio personality Ray
Mitchell for 25 years, died Wednesday of respiratory failure caused
by an avian strain of tuberculosis, the Riverside County Coroner's
Office said.
   The actress once recalled that she broke into the entertainment
business by dancing in a Los Angeles restaurant in exchange for free
dinners for herself and her mother.
   She appeared in her first film, ``Eight Girls in a Boat,'' in
1933 and went on to play a wide range of roles, from a saloon girl
in ``Luck of the Roaring Camp'' to a nun in ``Melody Lingers On,''
gaining recognition as Hollywood's leading lady of ``B'' movies.
   She also had the title role in a 13-part serialization of the
``Brenda Starr'' comic strip in 1945.
   She concluded her film career with ``Time Travelers'' in 1963,
and that year helped found the Valley Players Guild in Palm Springs,
working in more than 120 productions over 25 years.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Three bombs damaged two apartments and a
house in the capital, and a leftist group today claimed
responsibility.
   The dwellings were empty when the explosions occurred late
Wednesday and early today, and police said no injuries were reported.
   A police spokesman said the house belonged to a Greek diplomat
and the apartments to a taxi driver and a businessman.
   ``None of the apartments belonged to any important people, that
is, people that could be considered likely targets of a terrorist
attack,'' said the spokesman, who requested anonymity in accordance
with Greek practice.
   The leftist November 17 group took responsibility for the
explosions in a proclamation sent to the afternoon daily Ethnos. The
group said it blew up the empty homes to protest the lack of
affordable housing in the metropolis.
   The group is named after the day in 1973 when troops crushed a
student uprising against the 1967-74 military dictatorship.
   It has claimed 13 killings since it first surfaced with the 1975
assassination of Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in Greece.
They have also claimed the killing of two other U.S. officials.
   None of its members has ever been arrested.

``being thrown to the wolves.''
   The campaign in this heavily Democratic city has been dominated
by the Democratic primary contest between chief rivals Richard M.
Daley and Mayor Eugene Sawyer.
   Vrdolyak said Wednesday at the campaign kickoff rally that Sohn
was ``a decent gentleman'' but was left to run with no financial
support.
   Sohn, a physician and lawyer, expressed no thanks for Vrdolyak's
``help'' and called him ``the Count Dracula of politics.''
   Vrdolyak, 51, a former Democrat, joined the GOP in 1987 soon
after he unsuccessfully sought the mayor's chair as a third-party
candidate against his arch-foe, the late Harold Washington. Vrdolyak
waged another losing battle in November for Cook County court clerk.
   Tuesday's primaries and the April 4 general election are to
complete the final two years of Washington's second term. Washington
died of a heart attack in November 1987.
   Mike Royko, the Pulitzer Prize-winning syndicated columnist based
at the Chicago Tribune, said Vrdolyak ``could sure create problems,
the most obvious effect of which would be to siphon off white votes
from Rich Daley.''
   Daley and Vrdolyak are white; Sawyer is black.
   Vrdolyak rejected the ``spoiler'' label.
   ``The very essence of the word `spoiler' means that we have to
have a racial quota on who can run for office,'' he told the crowd
of about 400, ``and the very essence is racist, and we should put it
out of any campaign.''
   But Daley, Cook County state's attorney and son of late Mayor
Richard J. Daley, said he thinks he is the target.
   ``I think they're all out to stop me,'' he said.
   Sawyer denied that he could benefit significantly from Vrdolyak's
entry. ``He could be siphoning some (votes) from me,'' the mayor
said.
   The GOP and Democratic primary winners will face third-party
candidate Timothy Evans, a black alderman, in the general election.

<HEAD>Defense Says Younis Was Following Orders From Militia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fawaz Younis contends he led the hijacking of a
Jordanian airliner in June 1985 because his superiors in the Shiite
Moslem militia ordered it, but that may not be the key defense when
he goes on trial Friday.
   The case is considered a landmark because Younis was the first
suspected terrorist arrested under the 1984 Hostage-Taking Act,
which gives the United States jurisdiction outside its territorial
boundaries when American citizens are taken hostage.
   No one was killed in the 39-hour hijacking of 72 passengers and
crewmembers, which ended when the airliner was returned to Beirut,
the passengers and crew released and the Boeing 727 blown up.
   In a pre-trial hearing Wednesday, defense attorney Francis D.
Carter said he would argue that his client led the hijacking on
orders from commanders of the Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem faction
in Lebanon.
   An appeals court has already allowed the admission into evidence
of a confession made by Younis after he was arrested by FBI agents
in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea in September 1987.
   The evidence against Younis includes the confession, testimony
from passengers and a videotape of the defendant standing near the
hijacked plane at Beirut airport. The hijackers were demanding that
Palestinian guerrillas be removed from Lebanon.
   Carter won tentative approval Wednesday from U.S. District Judge
Aubrey E. Robinson to allow expert testimony concerning Amal on
condition that the defendant testify that he was ordered by his
superiors to hijack an airplane.
   ``If he testifies that he had a direct order, we may allow it,''
said Robinson. But he ruled out a defense based on the theory that
all mechanisms of law and order had broken down in Lebanon, and that
``any reasonable'' person would have followed a command to hijack an
airplane.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson argued against allowing
such testimony, saying that the hijacking ``is so patently criminal
that the defense of following orders should not be allowed in this
case.''
   On the use of Younis' confession, Robinson indicated that despite
the decision of the appeals court, the defense could try to persuade
the jury that federal agents induced Younis to confess by taking
four days to transport him to a Navy vessel in the western
Mediterranean, and giving him only bags of ice to treat injuries
suffered during his arrest.
   ``His wrists were broken and he was sea-sick,'' said Carter.
   Younis was lured to the yacht, a two-masted sailboat under
control of federal agents, by the promise of what Carter called ``a
bogus narcotics deal.''
   ``It is not something that my client regularly does,'' said the
defense attorney.
   Younis has been held at a federal prison facility on the East
Coast that attorneys decline to identify. He waived his right to
appear at the pretrial hearing. He will provided with Arab-speaking
interpreters during the trial.
   Johnson said that three witnesses in the case are in the federal
witness protection program, and that several prosecution witnesses
were overseas.

<HEAD>Ban on Assault Rifles Rejected by House Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state House Judiciary Committee has
rejected three gun-control measures, including a proposed ban on
military-style assault weapons introduced after five pupils were
killed in a California schoolyard.
   The panel on Wednesday threw out the bill offered by Peter
Franchot after voting against police-supported amendments that would
have replaced a general definition of assault rifles with 28
weapons. The amendments would have made it illegal to sell handguns
holding 20 or more bullets or detachable magazines for
semi-automatic rifles, but would have let people keep guns they
already own.
   Most opposition during debate Wednesday was to the amendments'
lateness.
   Franchot's bill was introduced after five elementary students
were killed in January when Patrick Edward Purdy used an assault
rifle to spray a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard with more than 100
bullets in less than two minutes.
   The panel also killed a bill that would have required the sale of
guns from one private owner to another be reported to state police,
and one that would have increased penalties for people caught
carrying guns without permits.
   Under Maryland law, semi-automatic weapons can be bought over the
counter without a background check or waiting period, and only sales
by licensed dealers are reported to the police.
   The committee's action was a victory for the National Rifle
Association, which had spent a record $6 million in an unsuccessful
campaign to overturn a new Maryland law that bans cheap handguns.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union may resume ties with Israel
if the Jewish state takes part in an international peace conference
that includes the PLO, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
said today.
   In a speech to Egyptian political leaders at the end of a
four-day visit, Shevardnadze also made what he called his ``first
critical remark about the new president of the United States,''
saying George Bush was trying unjustly to limit the Soviet role in
the Middle East.
   His comments about Soviet ties with Israel, where were severed by
Moscow during the 1967 Middle East war, came one day after he met
with Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens in Cairo.
   ``We would like the government of Israel to know that once it
opts for the conference and agrees to a dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, our two countries could take yet another
step toward re-establishing full diplomatic relations,'' he said.
``The beginning of the conference would be a starting point for
resumed relations.''
   On Wednesday, Arens rejected the idea of a conference with the
PLO. However, he told reporters afterward the Soviets have a role to
play in Middle East peacemaking even without diplomatic ties with
Israel.
   However, in Paris today, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel
said the Soviet Union must first establish normal relations with
Israel before it can play a role in solving the Mideast conflict.
   ``We wait for this act on the part of Moscow,'' Shamir told a
news conference. ``I hope it will be forthcoming.''
   In Jerusalem, Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
today that Arens and Shevardnadze agreed to expand their nations'
relations through delegations that will meet in the next few weeks.
A Foreign Ministy official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
without elaboaration that the delegations will focus on the Middle
East conflict.
   Israel's Hadashot newspaper said Arens and Shevardnadze also
agreed to advance ties by making the consular offices in each
country permanent.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat today said in Cairo the Soviet Union's
new dialogue with Israel is giving him a channel for ``indirect
negotiations'' with Israel.
   Speaking to reporters one day after he met with Shevardnadze,
Arafat rejected direct negotiations between Israel and the PLO
outside of the proposed international peace conference.
   In today's speech, Shevardnadze warned Israel that it ``has no
right to deny freedom of choice to the Palestinian people.''
   ``Unless a peaceful, comprehensive political settlement is found
... developments in the region would follow a spiral wound by the
logic of military confrontation,'' he said. ``The region faces the
threat of an arms race which sooner or later would degenerate into a
nuclear face-off.''
   Shevardnadze alluded to Israel's reported possession of a
substantial nuclear arsenal and possible efforts by Arab states to
acquire nuclear or chemical weapons.
   The speech appeared to sum up his visits to Syria, Jordan and
Egypt. He later left for Iraq and planned to visit Iran before
returning home.
   Shevardnadze was in Egypt when Bush made remarks Tuesday
relegating the Soviet Union to a ``limited role'' in the Middle East.
   ``He made a qualification that I didn't like. He said the role of
the Soviet Union should be limited. That is very sad because it
injects an element of rivalry that is unnecessary,'' Shevardnadze
said.
   He added with as smile: ``This is my first critical remark about
the president of the United States.''
   Shevardnadze spoke in Russian, and Arabic and English
translations of his remarks were available.
   Shevardnadze over the weekend unveiled a Soviet proposal that the
five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council prepare for an
international conference to negotiate an Arab-Israeli peace
settlement.
   The PLO would attend as a full partner.

   Winning a Grammy Award was not that
exciting, says John Adams, who won in the contemporary classical
composition category for his opera, ``Nixon in China.''
   ``I'm not excited about (winning) ... because it's an industry
award meant to hype rock'n'roll,'' Adams, creative chair of the St.
Paul Chamber Orchestra, said Wednesday night.
   ``In the classical field, the awards are given unimaginatively.
It's high name recognition; (Sir Georg) Solti wins all the time,''
he said. ``In the past I lost to Vladimir Horowitz and Andrew Lloyd
Webber. I guess old Dick Nixon carried me over the top.''
   Adams' opera is about President Nixon's historic 1972 trip to
China.
   He attributed his victory, in part, to the fact that his opera
received widespread media coverage, a presentation on public
television and had Nixon's name in the title.

   BONN, West Germany _ The federal government announced it has
suspended plans to help rebuild Iran's war-ravaged economy and won't
resume credit talks until the execution order against Rushdie is
withdrawn. The country is Iran's biggest trading partner.
   Parliament calls Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death sentence a
``declaration of war'' against Western values.
   The Kiepenheuer and Witsch publishing house of Cologne said it
will publish the German-language edition of ``The Satanic Verses,''
reversing an earlier decision not to publish it.

   LONDON _ Rushdie was in hiding for a ninth straight day with his
wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   London's Observer newspaper said it has received from Rushdie his
review of fellow novelist Phillip Roth's autobiography and will run
the piece Sunday. The review, which arrived a week late, ``rather
carefully and subtly'' makes known Rushdie's feelings about his
predicament, said literary editor Blake Morrison.
   Former pop singer Cat Stevens, who gave up a successful music
career in 1977 after becoming a Moslem, spoke out in support of
Khomeini's death order. ``The Koran makes it clear _ if someone
defames the prophen (Mohammed), then he must die,'' said Stevens,
whose hits included ``Peace Train'' and ``Wild World.''

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China and Indonesia today agreed to normalize
relations, 22 years after they suspended ties over allegations that
China supported a communist coup attempt against the Indonesian
government.
   Indonesian President Suharto and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen reached the agreement after meeting for more than two hours
at a Tokyo hotel, said Max Lapod, spokesman for the Indonesian
Embassy in Tokyo.
   ``We are going to go through the process of normalizing relations
based on the five principles of non-interference, non-aggression,
mutual respect, beneficial relations and peaceful coexistence,''
Lapod said in an interview.
   ``Both sides are very satisfied with their statements,'' he said.
   Suharto and Qian are in Tokyo to attend Friday's funeral for
Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer Jan. 7.
   Indonesia suspended relations with China in 1967, two years after
an attempted communist coup in Jakarta in which Indonesia alleged
Chinese backing.
   ``We don't call it severed, we say relations were frozen,'' Lapod
said. ``We've been talking at international conferences in Jakarta
and at the United Nations.''
   Suharto and Qian accepted invitations for the Indonesian and
Chinese presidents to exchange visits, which could take place as
early as this year, Lapod said.
   Meanwhile, China's state-run news agency Xinhua reported that
Qian and Suharto ``agreed upon future efforts for normalization of
bilateral relations.'' The meeting with Suharto marked the beginning
of the normalization process, Xinhua quoted Qian as telling
reporters.
   ``They agreed that the two countries should make further efforts
toward the normalization of bilateral relations, which they said
should be achieved on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
coexistence,'' the news agency quoted an unidentified official as
saying.
   China long has been pressing for normalization of relations with
Indonesia, but Jakarta has held back largely because of fear China
would use its influence among Indonesia's ethnic Chinese to foment
unrest.
   About 4 million of Indonesia's 168 million people are ethnic
Chinese, many of them wealthy businessmen.
   China has repeatedly assured Indonesia it will follow a hands-off
policy.
   Last spring, Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shuqing visited Jakarta
and told Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas that China would not
interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, including
Indonesia.
   Direct trade, which the two countries resumed in 1985, reached
$611 million in 1987, with Indonesia enjoying a more than $100
million surplus.
   Indonesia's move is certain to be studied in Singapore, which has
said it will not establish ties with Beijing until Indonesia does.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Makes First Visit To Chernobyl Nuclear Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev inspected the site of the
Chernobyl nuclear disaster for the first time today, and an official
said the president discussed safety measures taken since the 1986
reactor explosion.
   The 57-year-old Kremlin chief visited the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant's control room and the hall where turbines generate
electricity, said Yuri Risovany, a spokesman for Kombinat, the
company running the plant.
   The April 26, 1986 explosion, the world's worst nuclear power
disaster, sent a cloud of radiation around the world and killed at
least 31 Soviets. It also shocked many Soviets into reassessing the
safety of nuclear power.
   Gorbachev met with plant managers and workers and discussed
safety measures taken after the explosion, the spokesman said in a
telephone interview.
   Three of the plant's four reactors were operating during
Gorbachev's visit, Risovany said. The damaged No. 4 reactor, encased
in a steel-and-concrete shell, does not operate.
   The visit to the plant, 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital
of Kiev, came on the third day of a four-day trip to the Ukraine.
   Gorbachev then traveled to Slavutich, a town 30 miles to the west
built to house plant workers after the accident. Workers previously
lived in Pripyat, a city just a few miles from the striken plant.
   Gorbachev met with Kombinat officials to discuss their work and
returned to Kiev, Risovany said.
   In Kiev, Gorbachev met workers, farmers and Communist Party
activists and other Ukrainians, the official news agency Tass
reported.
   The official Soviet media carried no immediate reports on
Gorbachev's visit to Chernobyl and Slavutich.
   In Kiev on Monday, Gorbachev assured residents concerned about
the safety of a nuclear power plant being built on the Ukraine's
Crimean Peninsula that Soviet officials are taking a very cautious
approach to nuclear power.
   ``One shouldn't play around in these matters,'' Gorbachev told a
crowd. ``It's serious. Don't think we want to trick anyone. We would
only back ourselves into a corner.''

   Bitterly cold air rushed across the Deep South today, with snow
falling almost as far south as the Gulf of Mexico, and heavy snow
fell around Chicago.
   Temperatures crashed to record lows across the Midwest and as far
south as Tennessee, and wind chill factors fell below zero deep in
the South. Pensacola, Fla., fell to 30 degrees.
   Snow flurries were reported in Alabama as far south as northern
Mobile and Baldwin counties on the Gulf coast. The snow accumulated
in northern Alabama and state authorities said Interstate 59 north
of Trussville and Interstate 20 near Leeds were closed.
   An inch of snow fell at Athens, Ga., with flurries across Georgia
to the Florida border, and visibility was as low as one mile in snow
at Meridian, Miss.
   Record lows today included 17 at Memphis, Tenn.; 2 at Kansas
City, Mo.; 13 below zero at Norfolk, Neb.; 13 below zero at Spencer,
Iowa; and 10 below zero at Traverse City, Mich.
   A combination of cold and gusty wind produced wind chill values
of 11 degrees below zero at Memphis Naval Air Station in Tennessee,
14 below at Harrison, Ark., and 22 below at Springfield, Mo.
   The National Weather Service said temperatures tonight would fall
to the teens in Alabama from Huntsville to Mobile, and said many
efforts to save crops would be fruitless because of strong wind and
the duration of freezing temperatures.
   Schools were closed in sections of Tennessee, South Carolina and
Georgia, including the University of Georgia. One Georgia traffic
death was blamed on icy pavement.
   A low pressure system was expected to develop off the Carolina
coast tonight and spread snow from North Carolina across eastern
sections of the mid Atlantic states toward southern New England, the
weather service said. Winter storm watches were posted from North
Carolina up the coast to New York City.
   Snow also fell around the Great Lakes, with the heaviest
accumulations around the southern tip of Lake Michigan.
   Porter County in extreme northwest Indiana reported 13 inches of
snow and 6 to 10 inches were reported in Lake County, Ill., just
north of Chicago. High winds caused near blizzard conditions in some
areas.
   A heavy snow warning was in effect for portions of northwest
Indiana and northeast Illinois.
   Snow advisories were in effect for northeast Alabama, eastern
Tennessee, the northern mountains of North Carolina, portions of
Ohio, and along Lake Ontario in western New York state.
   Temperatures along the East Coast were dropping, reflecting the
forward edge of the arctic air, but readings were still above
freezing as far north as southern New England.
   Early morning temperatures were mild in the West, with readings
in the 30s and 40s in most places, 50s in California, and 50s to mid
60s in the Desert Southwest.
   Showers were widely scattered over the northwest quarter of the
nation.
   Today's forecast called for light snow over much of the East from
New England to northern Georgia and into the Appalachians. Rain was
expected directly along the coast. Rain also was forecast for the
Pacific Northwest, and rain or snow was predicted for the northern
Plateau and northern Rockies.
   Highs were expected to be in the single digits and teens over the
Great Lakes and the upper Mississippi Valley; the 20s and 30s over
most of the eastern half of the nation, with lower 40s along the
Carolina coast; the 40s to lower 60s over central and southern
Florida; and the 40s and 50s in most of the nation from the Plains
to the Pacific Coast, with 60s in southwest Texas, New Mexico and
much of California, and 70s to mid 80s in Southern California and
the Desert Southwest.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 17 degrees below zero at
Hibbing, Minn., and Sioux Falls, S.D., to 67 degrees at Key West,
Fla.

   The next catastrophic earthquake on
California's San Andreas Fault might be triggered by a moderate jolt
that ruptures a little-known fault hours earlier, says a study by
New York scientists.
   ``We have noticed a pattern of earthquakes, which, if it
continues, could trigger the southern San Andreas'' to snap in a
``major'' quake measuring 7 on the Richter scale or a ``great''
quake of magnitude 8, said geologist Ken Hudnut, of Columbia
University's Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory.
   The next quake in the pattern of northward-migrating temblors is
likely to occur on the Extra Fault 90 miles northeast of San Diego,
Hudnut and seismologists Leonardo Seeber and Javier Pacheco said in
this month's issue of Geophysical Research Letters.
   A magnitude-5.5 temblor on the Extra Fault ``could be all it
takes to start a large-to-great earthquake on the San Andreas
Fault,'' which the Extra Fault intersects, Hudnut said by phone from
Palisades, N.Y.
   ``It's a reasonable scenario,'' U.S. Geological Survey
seismologist Lucile Jones said Wednesday.
   Hudnut's theory, along with others about how California's
long-dreaded ``big one'' could begin, soon will be reviewed by a
USGS committee co-chaired by Jones and California Institute of
Technology geologist Kerry Sieh.
   ``We want to consider ahead of time how we would respond to
various smaller earthquakes and other physical phenomena that might
be precursors to a great earthquake,'' Sieh said.
   Jones said the committee will decide whether and when public
warnings should be issued if ominous signs of an impending ``big
one'' are detected.
   Such warnings could spur evacuations of dangerous buildings,
preparations of emergency crews and equipment, and precautions by
citizens, said Mike Guerin, spokesman for California's Office of
Emergency Services.
   A USGS study last summer concluded that a major or great quake is
at least 60 percent likely within 30 years somewhere on the southern
San Andreas.
   If Hudnut's theory is correct, the quake would start where the
Extra Fault intersects the southern end of the San Andreas'
Coachella Valley segment, an area already considered overdue for a
big jolt.
   If the quake was limited to that 60-mile segment, which stretches
from the Salton Sea northwest to near Palm Springs, it would be a
magnitude-7 quake, Jones and Sieh said.
   However, the San Andreas might continue to rupture through an
additional 120 miles, on its San Bernardino Mountains and Mojave
segments, which are closer to Los Angeles. That would be a
magnitude-8 ``great'' quake, nicknamed ``the big one,'' Jones and
Sieh said.
   A 1980 federal report estimated such a quake would kill 3,000 to
14,000 people, seriously injure 12,000 to 55,000, and cause up to
$17 billion in damage.
   There is no indication when the Extra Fault might snap. But the
theory it might trigger ``the big one'' is supported by computer
calculations of fault behavior and a pattern in which quakes on
certain ``cross-faults'' have migrated north since 1979, Hudnut said.
   Cross-faults run from southwest to northeast, intersecting the
San Andreas and other major faults that run southeast-northwest.
   Jones and other officials spent a sleepless night after the most
recent cross-fault quake, a magnitude-6.2 jolt on the Elmore Ranch
Fault on Nov. 23, 1987. They worried it might trigger ``the big
one'' on the San Andreas, but didn't issue a warning. Instead,
scientists believe it triggered a magnitude-6.6 quake that occurred
11 hours later, on Nov. 24, on the San Jacinto Fault's Superstition
Hills segment, injuring 94 people.
   That experience spurred formation of the USGS committee, so
decisions on public warnings can be based on predetermined criteria
rather than being made during a crisis, Jones said.

<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs of Wright comment after 7th graf pvs, ``I'm

   The House ethics committee began closed-door
deliberations today on how to handle allegations of improper conduct
against House Speaker Jim Wright, as Republicans set their political
sights on the Texas Democrat.
   The panel started reviewing a voluminous report by its
independent counsel, Richard J. Phelan, who has been investigating
Wright for nearly nine months. The meetings are expected to extend
at least into next week.
   The politically sensitive nature of the process was evident in
the tight security surrounding the committee's activities. The
limited number of copies of the ethics report were being kept locked
up in the committee's basement offices, and the 12 members of the
panel _ six Democrats and six Republicans _ were not being permitted
to take them out of the rooms.
   Committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., paused on his way into
the session only to say tersely that the panel was meeting on
``routine business'' and that no announcements would be forthcoming
today. He said other meetings would be scheduled for next week.
   The panel is expected to decide within the next week or two
whether Wright violated House rules by abusing his office for
financial gain, as alleged, and if so whether to seek punishment of
the speaker.
   Whatever the outcome of that probe, Republicans already were
laying plans to make political hay of Wright's problems in the 1990
congressional elections. Edward Rollins, executive director of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, said the GOP campaign
organization will make sure Wright has a well-financed opponent next
year.
   ``I'm going to make a lot of Democrats stand up and defend Jim
Wright,'' Rollins said Wednesday. ``I'm going to give him the run of
his life.''
   Wright reacted strongly today to Rollins' threat, suggesting that
congressional Democrats would be less inclined to cooperate with
President Bush on budget and other matters if political attacks
persist.
   ``You can't have it both ways, obviously,'' Wright told
reporters. ``Rollins confirms ... what I have known all along _ that
the whole motivation of the inquiry was from its inception
partisan.''
   The speaker said he had no knowledge of the ethics report's
contents. He reiterated that he has violated no rules but
acknowledged that in retrospect he might have done some things
differently. ``There's 100 things you wish you hadn't done in your
life. Any of us ... would do a lot of things differently, sure,'' he
said.
   In a resolution approved last June 9, the ethics committee _
formally called the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct _ set
out to investigate Wright on six counts. They include allegations
that he improperly lobbied for a constituent with whom he had
financial dealings, that he used campaign and taxpayer funds to
publish a book on which he received $55,000 in royalties, and that
he improperly lobbied officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Phelan's report on those and other charges is the product of a
nearly nine-month preliminary inquiry, the ethics panel's equivalent
of a grand jury investigation.
   Today's meeting was scheduled for Phelan to present the results
of his work and for members of the committee to ask questions. The
next step for the panel will be either to dismiss the case, if it
finds no rules have been violated, or to call for a disciplinary
hearing if Wright is found culpable.
   Members of the ethics panel were asked to clear their calendars
next week to allow for continued meetings.
   Phelan and his staff interviewed 63 witnesses under oath and a
handful of other unsworn witnesses in the probe, which appeared to
extend beyond the six specific charges against Wright to include his
life and political career extending back four decades.
   The ethics committee has been given up to $850,000 to pay Phelan,
and reimbursement for expenses could push the total cost of the
investigation to more than $1 million.
   Wright on Wednesday maintained that he would be exonerated.
   ``I do know there hasn't been any violation of any law or any
House rule,'' he said. ``They spent over $1 million and a long, long
time, and went back into the last 40 years of my personal and public
life. That's fine. I'm glad they did.''
   Wright said the result is ``a thorough and exhaustive
investigation _ one nobody under the widest stretch of the
imagination could describe as a whitewash.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., sought recently to press a resolution
through the House Republican Policy Committee calling for public
disclosure of all the evidence. But he agreed to withhold the
resolution for now after being assured by Rep. John Myers, R-Ind.,
the senior Republican on the ethics panel, that a detailed report
will ultimately be made public.

   A man who says he stole books and a
calculator from a book store eight years ago has apologized to the
store and sent a check for $300.
   ``I just think it was such a neat thing. We had such a hoot when
we got it,'' said Paula Roberts, manager of the Smith Book Store.
   Rick Lawson admitted swiping the goods while he was a student at
Oklahoma State University in 1981. He said he took the materials
because he did not have the money to buy them at the time.
   In his letter, received by the store Feb. 16, Lawson said he
``recently surrendered my life to the Lord'' and asked store
officials for their forgiveness.
   Lawson, who now lives in Saginaw, Texas, said in a telephone
interview that ``it was a tough decision, but it had to be done.''
   ``I could tell it was the right thing to do,'' he said.
   ``I think it took a lot of courage to write that letter,'' Ms.
Roberts said, adding that she plans to commend Lawson for his action.

<HEAD>Red Cross Resumes Sudan Airlift; Government Confirms Shelling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Cross said today it resumed an
airlift of food and medicine to tens of thousands of starving people
in southern Sudan after a two-week interruption caused by
``technical problems.''
   The government confirmed the rebel shelling of an important
southern provincial capital and said 11 civilians died.
   Bernard Juler, acting director of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, told The Associated Press the airlift resumed
Wednesday and that three planeloads had already reached Wau, capital
of the southern Bahr el-Ghazal region, 625 miles south of Khartoum.
   The Red Cross was able to get approval from the government and
the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army, or SPLA, in December to
airlift supplies to both government-held and rebel-held areas in the
south.
   It had been difficult to get relief to the south because the
rebels were shooting at civilian and military flights there,
claiming the army was using relief planes to transport its supplies.
   The airlift was abruptly stopped two weeks ago.
   ``It was only technical questions and we have overcome that. We
have supplied both the government and the SPLA with new (flight)
programs and schedules and we obtained the okay,'' Juler said.
   Juler said that airlift would continue as long as it was needed
and conditions were favorable. He said there would be two flights a
day, each carrying about 17 tons of food and medicine.
   The flights to the government-held towns leave from Khartoum, and
those for the rebel-held areas leave from airports in northeast
Kenya.
   The rebels took up arms against the government in 1983, demanding
more autonomy and administrative and economic reforms.
   In a broadcast over National Unity Radio, monitored Wednesday
night in Nairobi, the Sudanese government said the Sudan People's
Liberation Army shelled the southern city of Juba on Monday, killing
11 civilians.
   More than 50,000 refugees have crowded into Juba in the past
year, seeking relief from famine and civil war.
   The rebels announced the artillery attack in an earlier broadcast
over their clandestine radio station, saying the shelling was
confined to military targets. Juba, a city of 150,000 about 80 miles
north of the Ugandan border, is the capital of Sudan's southernmost
province of Equatoria.

   U.S. authorities raided the downtown jewelry
market and arrested at least 37 people nationwide in an effort to
smash a $1 billion cocaine money-laundering ring allegedly run by a
Syrian national.
   The surveillance investigation, which lasted for more than a
year, was the biggest of its kind undertaken by the government,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady said in a statement released Wednesday.
   During the past two years, the illegal network processed at least
$1 billion through jewelry merchants in Los Angeles, Texas, Florida
and New York, authorities said.
   A key leader of the ring was identified as Wanis ``Joseph''
Koyomejian, 47, a Syrian national who lives in suburban Northridge.
He was ordered held without bail Wednesday night by U.S. Magistrate
Ralph Geffen.
   A man answering the telephone at Koyomejian's home declined to
comment and hung up. Calls to the house were unanswered this morning.
   The Los Angeles raid began just as stores in the nation's
second-largest jewelry district prepared to open for business
Wednesday.
   Hundreds of federal agents swept through the downtown district,
creating a traffic jam as incredulous onlookers stared while dozens
of employees were handcuffed at jewelry counters.
   Complaints filed in U.S. District Court here charged 33 people
and a Hollywood, Fla. corporation with laundering Colombian cocaine
profits. The 13-month-old probe, nicknamed Polar Cap, also led to
the seizure of 640 pounds of cocaine, according to court documents.
   It was unclear exactly how many people were arrested Wednesday as
authorities searched 85 locations in Los Angeles, New York and
Miami. The Justice Department statement, issued in Washington, said
37 people were arrested.
   The arrests came a day after a $1 billion heroin raid in New York
City, what authorities called the largest in U.S. history. Police
and federal agents had tracked 800 pounds of the drug from Southeast
Asia.
   The Los Angeles money-laundering operation was directed primarily
from two wholesale jewelry companies, Ropex Corp., owned by
Koyomejian, and Andonian Brothers Manufacturing Co., according to
court documents.
   The owners of Andonian Brothers, Vahe Andonian and his brother,
Nazareth Andonian, also were arrested Wednesday.
   The defendants were charged with aiding the distribution of
thousands of pounds of cocaine by laundering hundreds of millions of
dollars in cash. The money, packed like bricks and shipped by
armored car, was generated from cocaine sales in Los Angeles, New
York, Houston and other cities, Thornburgh said.
   In addition, the defendants were charged with conspiracy for
knowingly violating the Money Laundering Control Act and avoiding
requirements to report all transactions over $10,000, the government
said.
   Suspicious Wells Fargo Bank officials in Los Angeles notified
federal authorities in early 1988 that the Andonian brothers had
deposited $25 million in cash over a three-month period, documents
show.
   The complaint alleged the Andonian firm alone had laundered over
$500 million since 1986. A telephone call to Andonian Brothers was
answered by a woman who refused comment.
   Both companies also were accused of taking in large amounts of
``walk-in'' cash from drug traffickers.
   Koyomejian was arraigned Wednesday in Los Angeles with Sergio
Hochman, a Uruguayan native charged with overseeing the alleged
scheme. Hochman also was ordered held without bail by Geffen.
   Affidavits attached to the complaints indicated the scheme was
uncovered with the help of confidential informants, including drug
dealers, electronic surveillance and searches of trash collected at
the various businesses.
   Bank records were scrutinized along with the records of Loomis
and Brinks armored car companies, which regularly transported cash
for the defendants, the complaint said.
   From banks in California, New York, Panama, Uruguay and
elsewhere, millions were transferred by wire to various locations
around the world and into the hands of narcotics suppliers in
Colombia and elsewhere, the documents said.
   Ropex created false invoices for the sales of huge quantities of
gold to fictitious persons in order to explain the source of the
currency, the documents alleged. In addition, Ropex and another
company, Ronel Refining, allegedly transferred large amounts of gold
between themselves to reflect new sales.
   Ronel, based in Hollywood, Fla., was the lone corporation accused
in the complaints. A request for comment was left at the Ronel
offices this morning. There was no answer today at the Ropex company.
   The investigation involved the Drug Enforcement Administration,
the FBI, the Customs Service, the Internal Revenue Service, U.S.
attorneys offices in several cities and numerous state and local law
enforcement agencies.

   Most striking employees at a state-run
hospital that had been staffed by National Guard troops returned to
work today under a court order and their union leader's suggestion,
the hospital's administrator said.
   ``The numbers are good. This reflects a complete turnaround from
the past couple of days,'' General Hospital Administrator James P.
Benedict said after the 7 a.m. shift began work.
   Seventy-four of the 85 attendants scheduled to work showed up, as
did eight of 10 licensed practical nurses and virtually all of the
registered nurses. Benedict said the remaining number of workers
absent was normal for that shift.
   The National Guard, which had been helping to care for more than
400 chronically ill patients since the strike began Sunday night,
will remain at the facility for the rest of the day to help with the
transition, Benedict said. He said the Guard has been costing the
state $20,000 a day.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said Wednesday workers who failed to
return by 7 a.m. would be fired, and termination letters were
prepared overnight.
   Benedict said the letters had not been sent.
   At a hearing in Providence Superior Court, a state attorney, John
Breguet, told Judge Antonio S. Almeida the state would not seek to
fine Local 1350 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees even though the union did not immediately obey
the judge's order to return to work at 3 p.m. Wednesday.
   ``We believe 1350 is actively encouraging workers to return to
work,'' Breguet said.
   Almeida said he was annoyed that his order had not been obeyed,
but accepted the state's recommendation. He scheduled a new hearing
for March 15 and continued the back-to-work order until then.
   DiPrete called both sides to his office for three hours of
negotiations Wednesday, the first in five days, and said after the
talks that a settlement was near, but only if the union returned to
work.
   Union President Jospeh Fargnoli said he ``encouraged them to go
back to work,'' but it was up to each member whether to return.
   Some workers chanted, ``No work. No work,'' as they left the
union hall Wednesday. More than a dozen union members picketed near
the hospital's entrance.
   Nearly half of 66 scheduled attendants and 19 of 29 nurses
reported for their 3 p.m. shifts, said Benedict. Thirty acute-care
patients have been transferred to other facilities, he said.
   Union members walked out over claims that the state refused to
fill contract-mandated positions. The state, in an effort to cut
overtime, has refused to call in additional staff in many cases
where workers are sick.
   DiPrete said the state's offer of a 53-cents-an-hour pay raise,
rejected overwhelmingly by union members, was still available. The
increase would have raised attendants' starting salaries from
$16,600 to $17,600 and nurses' starting wages from $18,800 to
$20,000.
   Wednesday's negotiations ended with some concessions on staffing
levels after ``a ward-by-ward analysis,'' said Gerard P. Cobleigh, a
union attorney. Fargnoli said there was ``nothing concrete at all.''
   No new negotiations were scheduled but Fargnoli and Cobleigh said
they would return to the table if necessary.

   The former chairman of the House intelligence
committee testified at Oliver L. North's trial today that he knew
nothing of Reagan administration efforts to obtain aid for the
Nicaraguan rebels from other countries until after the Iran-Contra
affair became public.
   New details of the administration's efforts to solicit assistance
from foreign nations in return for increased U.S. military and
economic aid emerged during defense cross-examination of Rep. Lee
Hamilton, D-Ind.
   Defense lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. asked Hamilton if he knew
that the administration arranged for an Asian nation to sell
missiles to the Contras, asked an Asian country to supply
communications equipment and obtained aircraft from a Central
American nation to train rebel pilots.
   None of these countries was identified, but Hamilton told
Sullivan he was not told of these and other administration efforts
to solicit the Contra aid while direct U.S. military assistance was
banned by Congress between 1984 and 1986.
   ``My recollection is that my knowledge of the events came
subsequent to the time frame,'' Hamilton said.
   The defense is trying to blunt charges that North, a former White
House aide, lied to Congress about his efforts to assist the Contras
by showing that the Reagan administration didn't tell lawmakers
about its broad efforts to help the rebels by soliciting foreign
donations after Congress shut off U.S. aid in 1984.
   Hamilton, the leadoff prosecution witness in the U.S. District
Court trial, was followed to the stand by Adolfo Calero, the
American-educated president of the Nicaraguan Freedom Forces, as the
Contras were known.
   Colero said that from the time he joined the organization in
1983, ``it was my clear understanding that the effort to regain my
country was being financially supported by the United States
government.'' The CIA was understood to be the source of the money.
   Calero said the money flow dried up in May 1984, after Congress
banned military aid to the Contras. But he said members of the CIA,
accompanied by North, visited him and he gave them an account number
in a Miami bank.
   The Contra leader said that beginning in June 1984 and ending in
February 1985, $32 million was put into the account, of which the
rebels spent $17 million or $18 million for lethal weapons.
   But sometime in 1985, Calero said, North mentioned the need to
help American hostages in Lebanon and ``I said I would gladly
contribute money.'' He said he gave North $90,000 in Visa traveler's
checks.
   One of the charges against North is that he used at least $4,300
of that money for himself.
   Calero said he didn't expect that North would spend any of the
money for his personal use. He said North told him he kept a
detailed accounting of how he spent the travelers' checks, but ``I
never demanded it of him. I had absolute trust, I was not asking him
for an accounting.''
   Hamilton said he didn't know at the time that Secretary of State
George P. Shultz asked an Asian country to provide communications
equipment to the Contras because the rebels' devices were antiquated.
   He also said he wasn't told that that Shultz and then-national
security adviser John M. Poindexter knew of a plan by a Central
American nation to provide aircraft to help train Contra fighter
pilots.
   Sullivan asked if Hamilton was told that Poindexter's predecessor
as national security adviser, Robert McFarlane, authorized North to
contact ``a senior military official of an Asian country'' to
arrange ``the sale of missiles to the resistance.''
   Hamilton said he couldn't recall being told this. He also he was
not told that Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., then-chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, also met with the Asian official to arrange the
sale.
   On re-direct examination, Hamilton insisted that he did not have
to check the denials North and McFarlane made to him of news reports
the National Security Council staff was helping the Contras in
defiance of the congressional ban on such aid.
   ``Why did you rely in 1985 to the word of national security
adviser McFarlane?'' asked prosecutor John W. Keker.
   ``McFarlane was a top security adviser to the president of the
United States. Upon whom can I rely if I can't rely on the
president's top adviser?'' Hamilton replied.
   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, is charged with 12
felonies arising from the Iran-Contra affair that could result in 60
years imprisonment upon conviction.
   Among other things, he is accused of obstructing congressional
inquiries into his efforts to raise money for the Nicaraguan rebels.
This allegedly included lying at the 1986 meeting and helping
McFarlane, who has pleaded guilty to withholding information from
Congress, draft false denials in response to congressional inquiries.

   U.S. Rep. Donald E. Lukens was indicted
today on a misdemeanor charge stemming from allegations that he had
sex with a teen-age girl, a prosecutor said.
   The 58-year-old divorced congresman was indicted by a Franklin
County grand jury on a charge of contributing to the delinquency of
a juvenile girl, county Prosecutor Michael Miller said.
   Lukens, R-Ohio, faces up to 180 days in jail and a fine if
convicted, Miller said.
   Anna Coffman, the mother of a 17-year-old Columbus girl, has
accused Lukens of paying for sexual relations with her daughter on
two occasions, once four years ago when the girl was 13 years old.
   In a statement issued by his office in Washington, the four-term
congressman said: ``I do categorically deny that I contributed to
the delinquency and unruliness of a minor at any time.''
   Columbus television station WSYX on Feb. 1 broadcast a videotape
that shows Lukens apparently offering a job to Ms. Coffman after she
asked him why he was ``messin' around'' with her daughter. The
station said it secretly videotaped the Nov. 11 meeting between
Lukens and Ms. Coffman at a fast-food restaurant in Columbus.
   Lukens told Ms. Coffman he thought her daughter was an adult,
according to the videotape.
   The FBI reviewed the tape and said it found no evidence of
bribery or extortion.
   Police investigated Lukens last year and gave their report to
Miller.
   The grand jury heard testimony on Friday from Ms. Coffman and a
woman who said she saw Lukens with the girl in his Columbus
apartment. Another woman who said she saw the girl in Lukens'
apartment testified Tuesday.
   The grand jury did not request testimony from Lukens, and he did
not testify before the panel, Miller said.
   ``Had the congressman wished to testify, I would have allowed him
to testify,'' Miller said.
   Lukens also was the subject of published reports this week that
he sought and accepted a $95,000 bank loan in June 1985, a week
before he voted for a banking bill he sponsored while he was a state
senator. The bill allowed financial institutions to expand into
other states.
   He has declined comment on those reports, but a spokesman, Bill
Jarrell, said Lukens did nothing wrong and used no influence in
soliciting the loan, needed to save the family farm from foreclosure.
   Lukens was first elected to Congress in 1966 and served two
terms, and lost a bid for governor in the 1970 Republican primary.
   After that race, he was barred from seeking public office for
five years for not filing campaign reports on time. However, that
campaign law was changed before the five-year period expired, and he
was appointed to the state Senate in 1971 to fill an unexpired term.
   In 1974, while in the state Senate, he fought allegations that he
accepted $1,000 in campaign contributions from Korean businessman
Tongsun Park during his first stint on Capitol Hill. He denied the
charge, presenting the results of a voluntary lie detector test that
indicated he was not lying when he said he had not received a
contribution from Park.
   He returned to Congress in 1986.

   A judge acquitted a dentist today of one
charge in a scheme to conceal the death of a man whose family tended
his mummified corpse for nine years, but ordered the trial to
continue on another charge.
   Knox County Judge Daniel J. Roberts dismissed a charge of cruelty
to children against Richard G. Kunce, 57. Kunce, who also faces a
forgery charge, is accused of helping conceal the 1979 death of Carl
Stevens, 39, of rural Knoxville.
   Kunce later took the stand and denied committing any crime, and
the defense rested its case.
   Kunce, a live-in guest at the Stevens' home since 1986, said he
had met Stevens both before and after Stevens' death at age 39, and
described himself as a ``nutritional adviser'' to the family.
   ``I met him (Carl) once before he went down and I met him many
times after he went down,'' Kunce said.
   When he first saw Stevens' body in May 1980, Kunce said, ``Carl's
body was totally black, and Carole had been putting liquid vitamins
in his belly button.''
   Roberts' rulings today were in response to a defense motion to
dismiss both charges against Kunce, of Aurora. The trial began
Tuesday.
   The cruelty charge stemmed from allegations that Kunce taught
Stevens' teen-age children about suicide, black magic and
communication with the dead.
   ``I have come to the conclusion there is no showing what effect
(Kunce's) actions had on the children,'' Roberts said. ``There's no
evidence of injury to the children, therefore I must dismiss the
cruelty charge.''
   The judge said he did not dismiss the forgery charge, however,
because of contradictory testimony he felt jurors should consider.
The trial resumed after he issued the rulings.
   Authorities discovered Stevens' corpse last year when his cousin
saw it and called police. Authorities later learned that Stevens'
widow, Carole, had tended the corpse as if it were alive.
   On Wednesday, Kunce's attorney, John Pepmeyer, acknowledged his
client had helped Mrs. Stevens forge a power of attorney to
refinance her house, but he said Kunce signed the document ``to help
a friend, not to defraud anyone.''
   ``I didn't hear anything sufficient to prove criminal acts beyond
a reasonable doubt,'' Pepmeyer said. ``They (prosecutors) don't have
enough ammunition to get to first base.
   ``It has long been the law that fraudulent intent is an essential
element of forgery,'' Pepmeyer said.
   Knox County prosecutor Jonathan Schlake argued that Kunce helped
Mrs. Stevens deceive bankers in obtaining a new mortgage.
   ``The power of attorney document was capable of being used to
defraud someone on its face,'' Schlake said.
   Earlier Wednesday, police detectives testified that Kunce told
them he regularly spoke with Carl Stevens during the nine years his
corpse was in the home.
   Kunce said ``Carl was happy and content,'' according to the
detectives.
   One conversation took place just days before Kunce was arrested,
said investigator Dick Flanagan.
   ``Kunce said he was working out ... walked into the bedroom and
Carl said, `Good workout, Richard,''' the investigator said.
   Flanagan and Stephen Johnson, a Knox County sheriff's detective,
told of entering the Stevens home and finding the body dressed in
blue pajama bottoms and white socks, lying in bed with sheets pulled
up around his chest.
   Also Wednesday, forensic pathologist Larry Blum of McHenry said
he found no evidence of homicide when he performed an autopsy on
Stevens' corpse. The body had been naturally mummified.
   ``My opinion is that Mr. Stevens died of complications of the
disease of diabetes,'' Blum said, adding that the body could have
remained in its mummified condition indefinitely, if protected from
the elements.
   ``I've never seen a body completely mummified like Mr. Stevens,''
Blum said. ``This was a first for me.''
   Mrs. Stevens, 43, pleaded guilty last March to forgery and
failure to report a death. She was sentenced to 12 days in jail and
placed on two years' probation.
   Kunce faces up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine if
convicted of forgery.

   The Environmental Protection Agency was
criticized at a House hearing today for using skilled contract
employees as office workers, even though they were hired to inspect
hazardous waste sites.
   ``These contract rates are not minimum wage,'' but sometimes more
than $30 per hour, said Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., chairman of
the civil service subcommittee of the House Post Office and Civil
Service Committee.
   Sikorski, conducting the hearing to review EPA contracting
practices, also criticized EPA for giving contractors undeserved
monetary performance awards _ for paying contract workers for
attending conferences.
   He based his remarks on findings by EPA Inspector General John C.
Martin, who testified before the panel.
   Sikorski accused the EPA of taking a ``don't worry, be happy''
attitude, in which the agency views the criticism as ``perception
problems.''
   Henry L. Longest II, director of EPA's office of Emergency and
Remedial Response, told Sikorski, ``I'm not saying we don't have any
problems.'' But he also defended agency contracting, especially in
the Superfund hazardous waste cleanup program.
   The skilled inspection employees were working in the office, he
said, because ``we had data in-house'' on the hazardous waste sites
they would have inspected in Massachusetts, Longest said.
   He added that the incentive award fees are based on a
contractor's overall work, and can be given out even if certain
parts of the work are below standards.
   Martin described to the committee his findings on the EPA's
contract with NUS Corp.
   The agency hired the company, of the Washington suburb of
Gaithersburg, Md., to provide field inspection teams to inspect
potential Superfund cleanup sites in four of the agency's regions:
Atlanta, Boston, New York City and Philadelphia. The inspector
general's report estimated the five-year contract will cost $125
million by its finish.
   The report said the contract turned sour within a month of its
Nov. 1, 1986, beginning when the Boston-based Region I stopped
preliminary on-site inspections of hazardous waste areas. The region
ordered the contract employees to get data from state officials and
information supplied by the polluters of the sites.
   The contract employees' ``morale was affected since almost all
... activity was office work,'' the report said. During the 10
months the policy was in effect, 41 percent of the NUS professional
staff resigned or was transferred, the report said.
   The inspector general said the policy of paying for NUS employees
to attend conferences was questioned internally by at least one EPA
official, who wrote the practice ``might not hold up too well under
any type of scrutiny _ congressional, inspector general, or
otherwise.''
   A separate inspector general's report given the subcommittee
criticized the Philadelphia-based Region III management of EPA's
emergency Superfund response program _ which uses contract employees
to respond to environmental emergencies.
   The report found that members of a team of groundwater
hydrologists, toxicologists, chemists, and environmental scientists
often were used as file clerks.
   The inspector general's reports included comments from the EPA,
which defended its actions.
   The agency said the audit covered only the first 13 months of a
five-year contract and failed to list ``major accomplishments'' of
the site inspection program that occured near the end of the first
year.
   The EPA also disagreed with the emergency response team report,
emphasizing that maintaining good records was within the contract's
scope of work. But the agency said that to avoid the appearance of
wasteful work, the clerical tasks will now be handled by people from
the American Association of Retired Persons.
   Donald Couchman, the NUS vice president for administration,
declined comment, calling the report ``internal review of EPA
management.''
   The nation's Superfund program is designed to clean up hazardous
waste sites. More than 30,000 potential sites have been identified,
with 1,175 designated on a national priority cleanup list. Remedial
action has been completed at 48 sites, with some work under way at
more than half the priority sites, according to EPA.
   The NUS report said EPA was too lenient in evaluating company
work, and gave the company undeserved performance awards.
   One unit of contract employees received praise and award fees of
over $90,000 even though the team did not perform field work and had
transferred a large segment of the team to do work on a state
contract.
   At the top Superfund site in the country, the Lipari Landfill in
Pitman, N.J., the EPA paid a nominal award fee even though an EPA
official was sharply critical of the company's work, the report said.

   HISTORY _ Records date back to 300 A.D. with the rise of Yamato
court in Nara, western Japan. By the mid-seventh century,
Chinese-style rule had been established. Incessant clan warfare
prevailed from about 900 A.D. until the Shogun Tokugawa unified the
country in 1603 and closed it off to the outside. After the arrival
of U.S. ships in 1853, Japan adopted a constitutional monarchy in
1868 headed by Emperor Meiji, as well as a European-style
bureaucracy and a military. Militarists expanded Japanese rule in
Asia from the turn of the century until World War II, which ended
with the U.S. atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August
1945. U.S. occupation forces dissolved Japan's family-run financial
combines, purged military influence, tried war criminals and
introduced a democratic constitution. The late Emperor Hirohito
renounced his divine status after the war's end.

   Hans Hellmut Kirst, one of West
Germany's most successful post-war novelists, died Thursday at the
age of 74.
   Among his 46 books was the 1962 drama ``Night of the Generals,''
which was made into a motion picture in Hollywood.
   Kirst's works, which were translated into 28 languages and sold
more than 12 million copies worldwide, focused on military life and
modern historical events, such as the July 20, 1944, assassination
attempt of Adolf Hitler.
   Born Dec. 5, 1914, in the East Prussian city of Osterode, Kirst
left school in 1933 to become a career soldier with Hitler's army.
He served throughout World War II and was imprisoned by U.S.
occupation forces after the fall of Nazi Germany.
   He began his writing career in the late 1940s and gained
prominence with his ``08-15'' trilogy in the mid-1950s. ``08-15'' is
a military designation for basic recruits, stemming from the name of
a standard pistol issued to troops during World War I.
   His honors included a 1965 Edgar Allen Poe Award and the Knight
of Mark Twain designation in 1968.

   A woman who killed her husband by
repeatedly running over him with a car _ and who claimed she thought
he'd been possessed by Mickey Mouse _ has been sentenced to five to
15 years in prison.
   Roseann Greco, 52, of West Islip, was charged with second-degree
murder for killing her husband, Felix, in their driveway in 1985.
She insisted at the time that the cartoon character had taken over
her husband's body.
   Mrs. Greco was found mentally competent to stand trial and was
convicted in March of first-degree manslaughter. She could have
faced a maximum of eight and one-third to 25 years in prison.
   But Suffolk County Judge John Vaughn sentenced her Wednesday to
the minimum, five to 15 years.
   Assistant District Attorney Georgia Tscheimber urged the judge to
impose the maximum sentence, arguing that Mrs. Greco posed a threat
to her family if released from prison or a mental hospital.
   But defense attorney Edward McGuinness said the crime was the
result of his client's refusal to take prescribed medication for
mental problems. He said family members had asked for the minimum
sentence and promised Mrs. Greco would be ``watched carefully and
made to keep taking her medication'' when she is released.

   Barbara Bush has decided to keep any disagreements
with President Bush within the family after a public difference over
whether military-style assault weapons should be outlawed, it was
announced on Thursday.
   Under a new policy revealed as Mrs. Bush arrived here for the
funeral of Emperor Hirohito, the first lady no longer will talk
about controversial issues such as gun control and abortion.
   ``They are not the issues where she wishes to have a focus,''
said Anna Perez, her press secretary.
   ``It doesn't mean she doesn't have a right to an opinion. It
means she has a right to discuss them or not,'' Ms. Perez said.
   Mrs. Bush and her husband appeared at odds after she said in a
recent interview with The Associated Press that she ``absolutely''
favors a ban on military-style assault weapons, such as the one used
in the recent schoolyard massacre in Stockton, Calif., where five
children were killed and more than two dozen were wounded.
   Questioned separately, the president said he does not favor a ban
on semiautomatic weapons because they are used by sportsmen and
hunters. It was a semiautomatic AK-47 that was used in the Stockton
incident.
   Bush, a lifetime member of the National Rifle Association, the
nation's largest gun lobby, said police should do more to enforce
the laws.
   Ms. Perez quoted the first lady as saying ``there isn't that much
of a difference of opinion'' between Bush and his wife over the
issue of assault-style weapons.
   ``If there is, they will discuss it among themselves,'' Ms. Perez
added.
   The press secretary said Mrs. Bush wants to highlight issues such
as the homeless, the deadly disease AIDS and illiteracy instead of
controversial matters.
   Emphasizing that Mrs. Bush does not want to take the limelight
from her husband on important subjects, Ms. Perez said, ``She's not
the one that makes policy. She doesn't lobby Congress. She's not the
president.''
   Ms. Perez added, ``The opinions that are important, that require
the spotlight, are those of her husband.''
   Meanwhile, Mrs. Bush had tea with Naoko Takeshita, wife of
Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and expressed sympathy over
the death of Hirohito, who died of cancer at the age of 87.
   In turn, Mrs. Takeshita offered her congratulations on Bush's
election as president.
   The two women met at the official residence of the Takeshitas,
although the family actually lives in a private home in Tokyo. They
talked in a small, green-carpeted room decorated with flowers and a
pastel painting of Mount Fuji.
   For the occasion, Mrs. Bush wore an elegant black suit and her
trademark strand of imitation pearls. Mrs. Takeshita wore a navy
blue suit.

   Israeli-backed militiamen patrolling in southern
Lebanon today killed three Palestinian guerrillas about a mile north
of Israel's border, the Israeli army said.
   Armed forces radio and the Itim news agency reported the
guerrillas had planned to stage an attack inside Israel.
   An army official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did
not know whether they planned an attack, but he said they carried
wire cutters, indicating they might have planned to sneak through
the border fence.
   A South Lebanon Army patrol spotted the guerrilla squad about a
mile north of the village of Al Jibbayn in Israel's self-declared
security zone in southern Lebanon, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The patrol opened fire, killing the guerrillas, he said. Fighters
of the South Lebanon Army did not suffer casualties.
   Documents found on the guerillas' bodies showed they were members
of Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine,
a Marxist faction of the PLO, the official said.
   The guerrillas carried three Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles,
a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and grenades, the army official
said.
   On Wednesday, the Hawatmeh faction celebrated its 20th
anniversary, and underground leaders of the Palestinian uprising in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip urged Palestinians to mark it
with a ``day of confrontations.''
   Today's clash was the second involving a PLO faction since
December, when the Palestine Liberation Organization chief, Yasser
Arafat, renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   On Feb. 5, Israeli troops killed five guerrillas on the northern
border of security zone, and the army said the squad planned an
attack in Israel. Three of the guerrillas were from the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   The South Lebanon Army, a predominantly Christian militia
financed and trained by Israel, assists 1,000 Israeli troops in
patrolling the security zone. Israel declared the six-to-10 mile
strip in 1985 after withdrawing most of its troops from Lebanon.

<HEAD>Orders Drop in January, Analysts See Signs of Economic Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for ``big ticket'' durable
goods dropped 3 percent in January, the government said Thursday in
a report that some analysts said could portend a welcome slowdown in
economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said total orders fell $4 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $128.06 billion last month, pulled down by sharp
declines in the volatile transportation and defense sectors.
   Virtually all other major industrial categories were down as well.
   With other reports indicating the strong economy has resulted in
an acceleration of inflation, analysts said some moderation in the
pace of growth would be constructive.
   ``This is one of the first signs that the economy is cooling
off,'' Maury Harris, chief economist for PaineWebber Inc. in New
York , said of January's decline in orders. ``If you continue to get
this weakness in February and March, then all these inflation
worries ... will fall by the wayside.''
   Last month's decrease in orders was concentrated in reduced
demand for ships and tanks, which affect both the transportation and
military categories. Orders for aircraft and parts remained strong,
although down from December's high levels.
   Overall, transportation orders fell back 7.2 percent last month
after a 22.1 percent surge in December. Excluding transportation,
orders in all other categories were down 1.2 percent in January.
   In the erratic defense category, subject to wide swings depending
on when government contracts are signed, orders plunged 33.5 percent
in January after a 24.2 percent increase in December. Excluding
defense, all other orders were down 0.4 percent last month.
   January's 3 percent decrease in total orders was the biggest
decline since a 7.4 percent drop last July and the first drop since
a 2.8 percent decrease in September.
   Robert Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said manufacturers were experiencing ``a definite
deceleration in the rate of advance'' after an earlier boom that was
fueled by strong demand for exports and capital equipment.
   Orders had been up 10.9 percent for all of 1988, the best showing
since 1984, and had risen a robust 7.3 percent in December.
   ``The sizzling, blistering, frenetic pace that we had earlier has
given way to something that is more temperate,'' Dederick said.
``That is perhaps desirable given the concern about inflation. It
suggests we are perhaps moving toward a more sustainable growth
path.''
   However, Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the National
Association of Manufacturers, said it was too early to be seeing
signs of significant slowing.
   ``We see a slowdown later this year but not in the first
quarter,'' Jasinowski said. ``This report shouldn't be looked at as
a premature indicator that the economy is slowing.''
   He said the bright spot in January's report was a 1.5 percent
increase in demand for non-defense capital goods, a category
considered to be a good barometer of business intentions to
modernize and expand.
   In other industries, orders for primary metals were down 1.2
percent in January after a 4.4 percent jump in December, orders for
non-electrical machinery were down 0.8 percent after a 1.1 percent
increase, and orders for electrical machinery were down 2.3 percent
after falling 1 percent in December.
   Shipments of durable goods were unchanged in January at $124.18
billion, following a 3.5 percent increase in December.

<HEAD>Sullivan Says He Opposes Abortion</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 3 grafs new with committee vote; picks up 3rd graf pvs,
Sullivan apologized.</HEAD>

   The Senate Finance Committee voted 17-0 today
to confirm the nomination as secretary of health and human services
of Dr. Louis Sullivan, who testified that he opposes abortion except
in three circumstances.
   ``I am opposed to abortion, except when the life of the mother is
threatened, or cases of rape or incest,'' Sullivan told the Senate
Finance Committee.
   One member of the committee, Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo.,
replied ``present'' when the vote was taken.
   Sullivan apologized to Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., for having
``misspoken'' when they discussed Sullivan's position on abortion
last month.
   ``I support a human life amendment, embracing the exceptions just
noted. Like President Bush, I would welcome a Supreme Court decision
overturning Roe vs. Wade,'' the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion,
he said.
   Packwood, a pro-choice advocate, said that though he disagrees
with Sullivan's position on abortion, he will support his
nomination. He said the important decisions concerning abortion will
be made in Congress and the courts, not at HHS, which spends only a
small fraction of its funds on abortions.
   ``I think you're a whale of a guy,'' Packwood said.
   Sullivan said that if confirmed as HHS secretary, he would work
to encourage adoption and other alternatives to abortion.
   Abortion opponents were upset when Packwood reported that
Sullivan had told him during a meeting that the nominee favored
retaining the Supreme Court abortion ruling. Before his nomination,
Sullivan was quoted in an Atlanta newspaper as saying he favored a
woman's right to abortion.
   Sullivan, the only black Bush has nominated to his Cabinet,
outlined for the committee his goals in running the largest federal
bureaucracy.
   ``Bringing a new spirit of kindness and compassion to a vast
federal department _ one with 114,000 employees and a $400 billion
budget _ may seem excessively idealistic. But it is an ideal we can
and must attain. Nothing less shall be my goal as secretary of
HHS,'' Sullivan said.
   Among the things he hopes to achieve, he said, are finding ways
to contain rapidly rising medical costs in federal programs without
sacrificing quality of care for the poor and improving programs that
help the poor work their way out of poverty.
   He also said he wants to find ways to strengthen family life and
continue research efforts to find a cure for AIDS, as well as
cancer, heart disease and other debilitating diseases.
   Anti-abortion activists demanded assurances from the Bush
administration that Sullivan's policies would follow those of the
president on abortion, and he later asked the White House to
nominate three administrators known for their anti-abortion views to
top positions at the agency.
   Despite the controversy, Sullivan's confirmation appears to be a
certainty. Members of the Senate Finance Committee are expected to
approve his nomination after the hearing, and the full Senate is
scheduled to vote on Tuesday.
   His hearing was postponed three weeks ago because an FBI
background investigation was incomplete and questions remained about
his finances.
   But two weeks ago he put to rest concerns about conflicts of
interest when he decided to forfeit nearly $300,000 in severance pay
due him if he cut his ties with the Morehouse School of Medicine,
the Atlanta medical school he founded and has served as president.
   Sullivan told the panel that he will step down as president of
the school if he is confirmed by the Senate. He said he would take
an unpaid leave of absence as a professor of medicine and would
receive no compensation from the school. However, he would continue
to participate in fringe benefit programs offered by the school,
including life, health and disability insurance.
   He said he will not take the severance pay due him under his
contract with Morehouse in order to set to rest any concerns about
potential conflicts of interest. ``I felt it was more important to
clear up those questions by the action I took,'' he said.
   Sullivan, a blood specialist, will run the the federal
government's largest department. Its budget of nearly $400 billion
covers Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, the Food and Drug
Administration, the Public Health Service and the National
Institutes of Health.
   Sullivan faced questioning on the Bush administration's fiscal
1990 budget proposal and about many of the more than 200 programs
the department runs.
   In response to questioning, Sullivan said the Morehouse school
made a mistake when in 1984 it hired a Fulton County commissioner as
a part-time lecturer. That commissioner, Reginald Eaves, was paid
more than $34,000 over four years while he used his seat on the
commission to promote issues that benefited the school. In an
unrelated matter, Eaves during that period was convicted of
extortion.
   Sullivan told committee members it had been his understanding
that the commission was aware that Eaves was on the Morehouse
payroll. The commissioners, however, were not aware. He had
understood that the commission had approved of Eaves' position at
Morehouse, he said.
   ``This was a serious error on our part in not assuring this had
been done,'' Sullivan said.
   He told members of the panel the school has taken steps to assure
that kind of problem would not occur again.
   Several members of the panel said they hoped the White House
would review its decision not to allow Sullivan to take a paid
sabbatical leave from Morehouse while he is at HHS.
   ``It's grossly unfair to him,'' said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   The White House initially approved Sullivan's request to take a
paid leave but then reversed itself and said the medical school's
sabbatical policies did not meet the government's standards because
they did not provide for the policy to be implemented uniformly
among those eligible.

   The massive funeral for Emperor Hirohito and George
Bush's first overseas visit as U.S. president have brought all four
American television networks to Japan for a week of unprecedented
news coverage.
   In the costliest effort, CBS is wagering more than $2 million
that its reports will draw an interested audience at home. ``CBS
Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather said the effort was warranted
because Hirohito's death marked ``the end of the postwar era.''
   CBS' coverage, with more than 60 separate pieces to be broadcast
over 18 hours, is unprecedented because the network has taken its
entire show on the road: every news program except ``60 Minutes'' is
broadcasting from Japan. CBS also scheduled live covering on its
prime-time program, ``48 Hours.''
   The Japanese, always eager to learn how foreigners view them, are
busy drinking in the attention.
   One Japanese TV network is translating the CBS material and
running them nightly, and another network sent one of its anchors to
Los Angeles to report on the U.S. reaction to all the news about
Japan.
   But the country's week in the TV spotlight likely would not have
happened if Bush had not chosen Japan as the site of his first
overseas trip as president, said Lane Venardos, CBS executive
producer for special events.
   ``Of course this is the dawn of a new era in Japan and we felt
that was worth reporting, but George Bush provides the catalyst for
us to be here,'' said Venardos.
   With feature stories ranging from memories of World War II to
sumo wrestling, ``the risk is that people back in the U.S. won't
care and won't watch,'' said Venardos. ``If it's a turnoff, we will
have blown $2 million of CBS' money and will be looking for new
jobs.''
   Long working hours, attempts to drink in Tokyo's vibrant
atmosphere and learn some of its rituals are taking a toll.
   During a commercial on the set of ``CBS This Morning,'' host
Kathleen Sullivan joked about a traditional tea ceremony she and
cohost Harry Smith observed for the show.
   The two had to kneel on the floor without moving for a 30-minute
rehearsal of the ceremony, then repeat the excruciating half-hour
for the real thing. In introducing the spot, Sullivan sweetly read
her lines: ``Coming up _ tea and serenity.''
   ``And pain,'' she added through clenched teeth after the camera
had clicked off.
   CBS is not alone. ABC sent anchor Peter Jennings, NBC sent anchor
Tom Brokaw, and Cable News Network sent Mary Alice Williams and
Bernard Shaw.
   CBS started the week scooping the Japanese media on their own
turf with a 20-minute interview with former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone in which Nakasone made his first public statements denying
any involvement in a stock-profiteering scandal that has rocked the
government.
   CNN sent a staff of more than 100 to Tokyo to broadcast 20 hours
of live coverage of the funeral and of the gathering of world
leaders in Tokyo.
   ``NBC Nightly News'' is broadcasting Thursday and Friday with
Brokaw at a serene Japanese-style garden at a Tokyo TV station.
   Jennings is anchoring five nights of ``World News Tonight'' from
an outdoor post in the bustling commercial Shibuya area of Tokyo.
   All four have been spotlighting Japan's culture, economy and
emerging political clout in reports leading up to the funeral and
Bush's activities.

<HEAD>First Commercial Reactor Vessel Loaded and Waiting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHIPPINGPORT, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The huge pressure vessel from the
world's first dismantled commercial nuclear reactor is awaiting
better weather to begin its 8,100-mile journey through the Panama
Canal to Washington state for burial.
   The 1,000-ton vessel and neutron-shield tank from Shippingport,
the nation's first commercial nuclear plant, were packed in concrete
and lifted onto the 200-foot seagoing barge Paul Bunyan in the Ohio
River last week.
   The 60-day journey to the U.S. Energy Department dump at Hanford,
Wash., will begin in several weeks when officials can count on
better weather along its route down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers
and through the Gulf of Mexico and Pacific Ocean, department
spokesman Tom Bauman said Wednesday.
   ``We're going to make very sure it's very safe for sea before we
ship it,'' he said. ``There will be no danger whatsoever. In fact,
the radioactivity levels are less than 1 percent of the standards
allowed for this type of (radioactive) shipment.''
   The reactor vessel was hoisted from its underground site at
Shippingport, 30 miles from Pittsburgh, on Dec. 14 in the most
dramatic, although not necesarily the most critical, phase of the
five-year decommissioning.
   It was lifted by a crane, placed on a specially constructed
flatbed transporter with 320 rubber tires and rolled to the river
bank and the barge, which has a 4,000-ton capacity.
   The Shippingport plant was dedicated by President Eisenhower in
1957 and retired in 1982 after generating 6.5 billion kilowatt-hours
of electricity.
   It is the world's only commercial reactor to be dismantled.
Several nuclear plants have been mothballed or entombed.
   The government hopes to show that reactors that have outlived
their usefulness can be dismantled safely and affordably.
   Federal officials intend to remove all radioactive material so
the site can be returned to unrestricted use. No decision has been
made as to how to use the land.
   The decommissioning is expected to be completed by 1990 at a cost
of about $98 million.
   The cylindrical reactor _ 41 feet long, 30 feet high and 18 feet
in diameter _ is composed of a pressure vessel with 8-inch steel
walls and an encompassing neutron shield with steel walls 1{ inches
thick.
   Spaces within the assembly were filled with concrete to stabilize
it and reduce radioactivity.

   South Florida has extended invitations to
city officials from Hollywood _ South Carolina, Alabama,
Mississippi, Maryland and more _ to discuss ways to stop the movies'
Hollywood from hogging their name.
   The two-day conference next week was organized after the movie
capital tried to trademark the name Hollywood and charge a royalty
for its use by other communities.
   Mayor Mara Giulianti of the Hollywood, Fla., and the Chamber of
Commerce are offering free air fare, meals and accommodations to
representatives of 10 other Hollywoods _ except the one with the
sign on the hill in Los Angeles.
   The other Hollywoods are in Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas,
Arkansas, Arizona and Georgia.
   ``We're just a quiet settlement in the Blue Ridge Mountains. We
don't want anyone to preclude our right to use our name,'' said Bill
Dover of Hollywood, Ga., which he said was settled by his
great-great-grandfather in 1812. It is unincorporated, but then even
the Hollywood of movie fame is just a section of Los Angeles.
   The use of the name became an issue for Hollywood, Fla.,
residents and business leaders earlier this month when they learned
the Chamber of Commerce of Hollywood, Calif., had tried to register
the name with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.
   Florida city officials temporarily blocked the proposal.
   ``We're not going to pay a royalty to promote our own town in New
York,'' said Chris Garrett of the Hollywood, Fla., Chamber of
Commerce. ``We're not going to pay a dime.''

   John Codd attends Sunday school
religiously.
   He can boast of 70 years of nearly perfect attendance and has 70
attendance pins to show for it.
   ``Sunday school is a spiritual (boost) for me,'' said Codd, who
turned 80 Sunday and also leads a weekly Bible study for a group of
seven elderly people.
   ``I just enjoy the fellowship,'' he said.
   Getting there hasn't always been easy.
   At age 11, when Codd was visiting his grandmother in Chesterton,
Ind., a storm dumped 3 feet of snow.
   His uncle hitched a horse to a sleigh and got him to church; no
one else made it, but a church janitor initialed a card noting that
Codd had tried to attend.
   Codd received his first perfect attendance pin in 1916 from Grace
United Bretheran Church in Chicago. Two years later, the flu kept
him from receiving a pin, but he attended for 50 years from 1919 to
1969.
   Since then, Codd has missed Sunday school only three weeks
because of an operation and job obligations, he said.
   When traveling, Codd stops at the first church he comes upon.
   ``It doesn't matter what denomination (the church) is,'' he said.
``It's a shame we have so many denominations because the Sunday
school lessons and the people are about the same anywhere.''

   Lourenco Gomes, chief of Guinea Bissau's
national security forces and veteran campaigner for his country's

   Gomes joined the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and
Cape Verde in 1957 while it was still a resistance movement to
Portuguese colonial rule.
   He was held prisoner by the Portuguese secret service in 1960 but
was released and became a member of the party's politburo in 1965.
   He took over as Director of Guinea's National Security Forces

<TEXT>
   A Lebanese man suspected of hijacking a
Jordanian airliner with Americans aboard goes on trial Friday in a
landmark case highlighting the long reach of U.S. anti-terrorism
laws.
   Fawaz Younis is accused of participating in the June 1985
hijacking of a Jordanian jetliner en route from Beirut, Lebanon, to
Amman, Jordan. Younis, held without bail since his capture in
September 1987, pleaded innocent to charges that carry a maximum
sentence of life in prison if he is convicted.
   Younis is accused of leading the hijacking in which the Boeing
727 with 72 passengers and crew members was forced on a
Mediterranean odyssey starting and ending in Beirut. No one was
killed in the hijacking.
   The prosecution contends Younis and four companions, heavily
armed with AK-47 assault rifles, freed the hostages and blew up the
aircraft on the runway at the Beirut airport.
   Younis, 29, arrested in 1987 by U.S. intelligence agents, is the
first suspected terrorist captured under the 1984 Hostage-Taking
Act, which gives the United States jurisdiction outside its
territorial boundaries when American citizens are taken hostage.
   The decision to capture Younis came after the United States was
frustrated in an attempt to gain the extradition from West Germany
of Mohammed Ali Hamadi, allegedly among hijackers of a TWA plane in
which an American Navy diver was killed. Hamadi is on trial in West
Germany.
   Younis was identified in pretrial testimony as one of the guards
in the TWA hijacking, which took place three days later, but he has
not been charged in that case.
   In an operation involving the justice, state and defense
departments, Younis was lured by an FBI informant in Cyprus onto a
U.S.-chartered yacht with the promise of a drug deal and a party.
   Operating in international waters to avoid legal complications
with other countries, FBI agents transferred Younis to a Navy supply
ship in the Mediterranean, then to an aircraft carrier, and then by
airplane to Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington.
   Younis, who sustained broken wrists during his arrest, was read
his rights in Arabic and then provided interrogators with a
confession while he was at sea.
   The defense argued in pretrial motions that Younis' confession
was obtained illegally because he was seasick and in too much pain
to remain silent, but an appeals court has allowed the confession to
be admitted into evidence.
   Evidence against Younis also includes testimony from passengers
and a videotape of the defendant standing near the hijacked plane at
Beirut airport. The hijackers were demanding that Palestinian
guerrillas be removed from Lebanon.
   Witnesses in the case include two Middle Eastern crew members,
two American passengers and one Arab passanger.
   William Slade, an American student who was aboard the seized
airliner, has testified that Younis spent most of the time in the
cockpit but emerged about 10 times.
   At a pretrial hearing Wednesday, defense attorney Francis D.
Carter said he would argue that his client led the hijacking on
orders from commanders of the Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem faction
in Lebanon.
   Carter won tentative approval from U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.
Robinson to allow expert testimony concerning Amal on condition that
the defendant testify that he was ordered by his superiors to hijack
the plane. ``If he testifies that he had a direct order, we may
allow it,'' the judge said.
   However, the judge ruled out a defense based on a theory that all
mechanisms of law and order had broken down in Lebanon and that
``any reasonable'' person would have followed a command to hijack a
plane.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ramsey Johnson said that the hijacking
``is so patently criminal that the defense of following orders
should not be allowed in this case.''

   More than 24 hours after he'd left Washington,
President Bush's inner fires were still burning as brightly on
Thursday as the blaze in the fireplace of the U.S. Embassy, where he
ended his long day meeting separately with six world leaders.
   At the end of his first day in Japan, Bush spent three hours
speaking with two prime ministers, three presidents and a king _ one
after another.
   Sometimes, being president means doing the same thing, over and
over again.
   This was the procedure, and it did not deviate:
   Into an ornate, high-ceilinged room in the U.S. Embassy _ the
very room where a victorious Gen. Douglas McArthur first received
the vanquished Emperor Hirohito _ Bush received leader after leader,
such as Thailand's Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan.
   ``Nice cozy fire here,'' said Bush, leading the prime minister to
one blue chair, taking the other, while photographers snapped away.
They were, maybe, the most photographed chairs in Tokyo.
   ``You came in today?'' the president asked. ``How long a flight
was that?''
   ``About five hours,'' said Choonhavan. Bush nodded.
   The press was ushered out as the two leaders and a handful of
aides from both countries moved to a circle of not-too-comfortable
looking chairs elsewhere in the room for about 20 minutes of
diplomatic icebreaking. Choonhavan got 22 minutes. India's President
Ramaswamy Venkataraman got 28. Jordan's King Hussein got 20.
   Bush to Venkataraman: ``Did you come direct?''
   Bush to Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak: ``How are all the
problems of the world?'' And, with a wave toward the press corps:
``We can't discuss it until they leave.''
   ``For heaven's sake!'' exclaimed Venkataraman when he saw the
fire in the fireplace.
   It was remarkable. Smokeless. Well drafted. The flames shot
straight up. In between dignitaries, an aide moved in with fresh
logs, feeding the flames.
   But Bush's fire finally appeared to sputter a bit after his
27-hour day.
   At the end of his final chat, a clearly tired president waved at
reporters and said: ``See you guys. Sleep well.''

   The biggest cheer Bush heard all day _ the only noisy spontaneous
outburst of approval _ came hours and thousands of miles earlier, at
Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska. What brought it on was Bush's
suggestion to an audience of airmen, infantrymen and their families
that he'd like to return to Alaska _ to go fishing.

   It was at Elmendorf that Hirohito landed on the start of a 14-day
visit to the United States in 1975. During that trip, according to a
biographical sketch put out by the U.S. government, he acquired his
favorite American souvenir: a Mickey Mouse wristwatch.

   The U.S. biographical sketch of Bush issued in connection with
this trip diplomatically glosses over his wartime experiences. It
says he won four decorations as a bomber pilot in the Pacific
Theater, but says nothing about having been shot down by the
Japanese.
   And the U.S.-issued biography of Bush's Japanese counterpart,
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, covers the period from his birth to
his graduation from college in 1947, skipping Takeshita's wartime
experience. He was a pilot trainee when the Japanese sued for peace
in 1945 after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

   A pair of legs, severed cleanly at the

grocery store, police said.
   Detectives said they were not certain if they were dealing with a
murder.
   ``We have no idea what we have here,'' said Sheriff's Capt.

   The University of Utah's hospital morgue and anatomy labs found
no indication of missing body parts, said the university's Health
Sciences Center spokeswoman, Anne Brillinger.
   The university has not taken in a fresh cadaver in two weeks, she
said.
   The limbs, discovered Wednesday by a man rummaging for boxes, are
possibly those of a middle-aged man and may have been severed
earlier in the day, Jack said.

<HEAD>Arctic Faces Potential Ozone Time Bomb</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   An environmental time bomb is ticking away
miles above the North Pole as chemicals there threaten to damage the
Earth's protective ozone layer, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. said Thursday.
   ``Stated as simply as possible, this is one of the most serious
environmental threats our planet faces,'' Gore, D-Tenn., said at a
hearing during which a team of scientists reported on a
just-completed study of the arctic atmosphere.
   Dr. Adrian Tuck, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, said that while no direct evidence of arctic ozone
damage was found, scientists were surprised at the extent to which
conditions in that area show the potential for such damage.
   These threatening changes in the arctic atmosphere ``present a
virtual time bomb,'' Gore commented at a hearing of the Senate
Commerce subcommittee on science, technology and space.
   The North Pole study was conducted in an effort to determine if
that portion of the world has an ``ozone hole'' similar to that
detected over the South Pole in recent winters.
   Scientists are concerned about the seasonal depletion of ozone in
the air eight to 10 miles above the Earth's surface because it is
that layer that protects the planet from harmful ultraviolet
radiation from the sun. A 1 percent depletion of ozone worldwide
could lead to a 2 percent increase in skin cancer among fair-skinned
people, said Dr. Robert T. Watson of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   In addition, increased ultraviolet radiation could damage plants
and other life forms, including the plankton, krill and other ocean
life so vital to feed larger fish and animals, he said.
   Determining the extent of damage will not be easy, since little
research has been done and the NOAA budget for such studies was cut
annually under the Reagan Administration, said Sen. John F. Kerry,
D-Mass.
   Watson said scientists turned their attention to the north
because most of the world's people live in the northern hemisphere
and an ozone loss in that area could have even more significant
effects than in the south.
   The Antarctic ozone loss has been measured at as much as 50
percent in the southern winter, although the ozone is renewed in
summer as more air flows into that region from other areas.
   Good ozone statistics are lacking for other areas, Watson said,
although he estimated that between 1970 and 1988 the layer has been
depleted as much as 5 percent to 7 percent between 40 degrees North
latitude and 65 degrees North. That would be roughly between the
middle of the United States and the northern end of Norway.
   As to the arctic region itself, no significant loss was found in
the new study, but the region seemed poised on the brink, Tuck said.
   Dr. Susan Solomon of NOAA said the arctic study found increased
levels of chlorine _ the chemical blamed for the loss _ as well as
polar stratospheric clouds which can increase the rate of chemical
reactions which damage ozone.
   Chlorine migrates to high altitudes from a variety of sources
including refrigerants and other industrial chemicals. Many nations
signed a protocol in Montreal to reduce the use of these chemicals,
known as chlorofluorocarbons, but Watson said that agreement doesn't
go far enough.

   Pro-Iranian militants holding American hostages in Lebanon today
vowed revenge for the publication of ``The Satanic Verses,'' but
publishers in three countries reversed decisions not to put out the
book, and two U.S. bookstores returned it to the shelves.
   Former pop singer Cat Stevens, who gave up a successful music
career in 1977 after becoming a Moslem, supported Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's execution order on the book's author, Salman Rushdie.
   From his place in hiding, Rushdie sent London's weekly Observer a
review of novelist Philip Roth's autobiography. It arrived about a
week late.
   The newspaper said that while Rushdie makes no statement in the
review about his predicament, he makes it clear that he identifies
with Roth, whose books were once heavily criticized by his fellow
Jews.
   West Germany, Iran's biggest trading partner, announced it had
suspended plans to help rebuild Iran's war-ravaged economy, and the
Parliament condemned the death sentence as a ``declaration of war''
against Western values.
   Police in Canada said they received a bomb threat against the
Iranian Embassy in Ottawa.
   A Yugoslav republic criticized this week's visit to Belgrade of
Iran's president and joined the chorus of condemnations of the death
threat.
   Rushdie, 41, born into a Moslem family and living in London, was
in hiding for the ninth day along with his wife, American novelist
Marianne Wiggins, who canceled her own book promotion tour to stay
with her husband.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds
Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner in Beirut,
released a statement threatening to take revenge against Rushdie,
the book publishers and their supporters. The statement was
accompanied by photographs of the hostages but it did not
specifically threaten the men or any of the 12 other foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The group said it will ``take revenge against all those who took
part in strong and ferocious campaigns against Islam.'' The revenge
will cover ``all institutions and organizations that insulted in one
way or another'' members of the prophet Mohammed's family, it said.
   Some say ``The Satanic Verses'' insults Islam by portraying the
prophet's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran
rather than receiving it from God. Iranian clerics offered $5.2
million to anyone who killed Rushdie.
   Rushdie apologized Saturday for the distress the book has caused.
Khomeini, who on Feb. 14 called for Rushdie's death, rejected the
apology.
   In West Germany, the prominent Kiepenheuer and Witsch publishing
house of Cologne said today it will publish the German-language
edition of ``The Satanic Verses.'' The publishing house had said
last week said it would not publish the novel.
   Finland's WSOY publishing company and France's Christian Bourgois
publishing house also announced today they had changed their stances
and would publish the Finnish and French translations.
   Dutch police have taken ``preventive precautions'' to protect
Veen, the publishers of the Dutch translation, police said today.
   In Ottawa, police inspector Ed Gosselin said a man speaking
English called thge department's headquarters Wednesday evening and
said: ``Today there was an attempt to blow up the Iranian embassy.
It did not work but next time it will. Death to Iran.''
   He said a search of the embassy turned up nothing.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, responsible for embassy
security in Ottawa, said it tightened security at the Iranian
Embassy.
   In London, Stevens, whose hits included ``Peace Train'' and
``Wild World,'' endorsed Khomeini's death sentence, telling Moslem
students: ``The Koran makes it clear _ if someone defames the
prophet, then he must die.''
   The U.S. bookstore chains of B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble, which
last week pulled the book from their shelves, both reversed
themselves after nationwide rallies by writers and said Wednesday
they would have ``The Satanic Verses'' in stock in about 10 days.
   The decision was made at ``the urging of an overwhelming majority
of ... store managers and employees,'' according to a statement from
the chains, which are under common ownership.
   The Parliament of Yugoslavia's most liberal republic, Slovenia,
condemned Iran's death threat against Rushdie and also criticized
Belgrade's hosting of Iranian Pesident Ali Khamenei in the midst of
the controversy, the Tanjug news agency reported. Khameini ended an
official visit to Belgrade on Wednesday.
   In Bonn, West Germany, Economic's Ministry spokesman, Dieter
Vogel, said the government's credit talks with Iran will not resume
until the death threat is withdrawn.
   Finland's foreign trade minister, Pertti Salolainen, announced he
was postponing a scheduled trade visit to Iran because of the
``repulsive execution order.''
   From his place of hiding, Salman Rushdie has sent a review of
fellow novelist Philip Roth's autobiography to the weekly Observer,
the newspaper's literary editor said Thursday.
   Rushdie's review of Roth's ``The Facts'' arrived Tuesday, a week
late, said the Observer's literary editor, Blake Morrison. He said
the review will run Sunday.
   Morrison told The Associated Press that Rushdie makes no personal
statement in the review, but ``rather carefully and subtly'' makes
known his feelings about his predicament.
   ``In the course of reviewing Roth, who himself had a period when
he was vilified by the Jews, he says he found Roth was not just
speaking to him but for him,'' Morrison said.

<HEAD>At Imperial Funeral, Bush Pursues Mideast Peace</HEAD>

   President Bush used the occasion of an imperial
Japanese funeral to pursue a Middle East peace, while his secretary
of state challenged the Soviet Union on Thursday to pitch in with
deeds instead of ``simply rhetorical exercises.''
   On the eve of services for the late Emperor Hirohito, Bush
engaged in around of fast-paced diplomacy, meeting with a succession
of world leaders including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli
President Chaim Herzog and Jordan's King Hussein.
   After Bush's round of meetings, Secretary of State James A. Baker
III challenged the Soviets to contribute to the peace process in a
``concrete way'' by establishing full diplomatic relations with
Israel, using its influence in Syria and denouncing ``radical
countries'' such as Libya.
   Baker said a ``new dynamic'' for peace existed in the area and
that Bush hoped to nurture it. The president's sessions with Mideast
leaders provided a counterpoint to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze's 10-day tour through the region, where he attempted to
advance Moscow's role.
   On Friday, Bush was to attend an elaborate state funeral for the
late Japanese emperor, joining about 10,000 other Japanese and
foreign leaders in two giant, open-sided tents for the solemn
ceremony at Tokyo's Shinjuku Imperial Gardens. The park in downtown
Tokyo once served as the garden for the imperial household.
   Hirohito, the last of the World War II era world leaders, died
Jan. 7 of cancer at age 87 after reigning for six decades.
   In a meeting with Japan's Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita on
Thursday, Bush ``began by expressing the condolences of the American
people'' upon Hirohito's death, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   First lady Barbara Bush, meanwhile, donned a tailored black suit
and an elegant strand of pearls to pay a visit Naoko Takeshita, the
wife of the Japanese prime minister.
   The two women sipped tea at Takeshita's official residence, with
Mrs. Bush expressing sympathy over Hirohito's death and the Mrs.
Takeshita offering congratulations on Bush's election as president.
   Bush's focus on the Middle East during his first overseas trip _
a five-day visit to three Asian capitals _ appeared to be an effort
to steal some of the spotlight from Shevardnadze's journey to the
area.
   Baker, briefing reporters after Bush's full day of meetings with
world leaders, said Soviet overtures to participate in a Middle East
peace were ``healthy, quite frankly.''
   But, he added, ``I suppose we would want to know that there were
concrete contributions that they had in mind, rather than simply
rhetorical exercises.''
   He said he would have a better idea of what the Soviets intend
when he meets with Shevardnadze in March in Vienna.
   Baker said contributing to the new dynamics for peace were talks
between the United States and the Palestine Liberation Organization
and statements by PLO leader Yasser Arafat denouncing terrorism.
   He said the United States intended to be active in the peace
process.
   However, he said ultimately a settlement would have to flow from
``direct negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis.''
   ``We are concerned that if we act too precipitously we might
preempt promising possibilities that could surface if we adopted a
more reasoned and measured approach,'' Baker added.
   Earlier, Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the subject
of a Middle East peace settlement also came up in a lunch with
French President Francois Mitterrand.
   ``We think there are some opportunities to move the (peace)
process forward,'' Fitzwater said. ``We want to be methodical and
deliberate in our approach.''
   Bush's seven hours of meetings with foreign leaders began
immediately after he stepped off Air Force One following a 16-hour
flight here from Washington.
   By the time he ended a day that had begun at 5 a.m. EST on
Wednesday, a clearly tired Bush waved at reporters and said: ``See
you guys. Sleep well.''
   His meetings also included sessions with Prime Minister Mario
Soares of Portugal, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan of Thailand
and President Ramaswamy Venkataraman of India in back-to-back
meetings at the U.S. Embassy, a block away from the Okura Hotel,
where Bush and his entourage are staying.
   He also paid a courtesy call on Takeshita. The Japanese leader
had been Bush's first foreign visitor to the White House earlier
this month.
   Yukio Okamato, a Japanese Foreign Ministry official, said Bush
and Takeshita called each other by their first names, ``George'' and
``Noboru.''
   During the session, Bush, a former combat pilot, did not mention
his experience of being shot in the Pacific during World War II by
the Japanese, Okamato said.
   ``The Japanese people are deeply touched by President Bush's
basic position, that he is concerned with the present, not the
future,'' Okamato said. In the meeting with Takeshita at the richly
decorated Akasaka Palace, Bush discussed a range of issues,
including trade, the environment, East-West relations and Cambodia,
Fitzwater said.
   On Cambodia, Bush voiced concern that the withdrawal of
Vietnamese there was proceeding ``at a slower pace than we would
like to see,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``President Bush also emphasized that we would like to see a
government in Cambodia that would involve Prince Sihanouk and would
not see a return to the power of the Khmer Rouge,'' the spokesman
said.
   After Friday's funeral, Bush was expected to participate in still
more face-to-face sessions with foreign leaders, including
Philippine President Corazon Aquino.
   U.S. officials had said a meeting with Aquino had been hard to
arrange because of scheduling difficulties.
   The president was to have an audience with Japan's new Emperor
Akihito on Saturday, before visiting Beijing, China, and Seoul,
South Korea.

<HEAD>Media Attacks Havel; Dissident Crackdown Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State media on Thursday attacked
playwright and human rights activist Vaclav Havel, and authorities
filed charges against three more activists in a harsh crackdown on
dissent.
   The Charter 77 human rights group issued a statement calling for
citizens to oppose ``the lies and injustice ... around all of us.''
Former Communist Party chief Alexander Dubcek was quoted as calling
for the release of Havel and all political prisoners.
   Also on Thursday, thousands of people attended a rally in a
Prague square marking the 41st anniversary of the ruling communists'
1948 takeover.
   The charges against Charter 77 signatories Vlasta Chramostova and
Libuse Silhanova and spokesman Tomas Hradilek were leveled
Wednesday, the same day a Prague court sentenced two younger
activists to nine months and one year in jail.
   Ms. Chramostova and Ms. Silhanova were charged with approving a
crime and attacking state organs, charges that carry a maximum jail
sentence of one year, said fellow activist Petr Uhl.
   Hradilek was charged with sedition, punishable by up to five
years in jail. The charges against Ms. Chramostova and Ms. Silhanova
were based on open letters they wrote Jan. 16 supporting a banned
demonstration the day before and condemning the police violence used
to break it up.
   The demonstration was to mark the 20th anniversary of the death
of Jan Palach, a student who set himself afire to protest the 1968
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   The actions and this week's conviction and sentencing of Havel
constituted one of the biggest crackdowns ever on the human rights
group.
   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo on Thursday carried a
lengthy attack on Havel, who despite strong protests from the West
and East bloc was ordered jailed for nine months Tuesday for his
role in a banned demonstration last month.
   Havel, a co-founder of Charter 77, was depicted as the son of
rich parents said to have collaborated with the occupying Nazis in
World War II and as a man who wanted to restore the bourgeois
democracy that existed before the war.
   Charter 77 issued a statement to commemorate the death on Feb.
25, 1969, of Jan Zajic, a 19-year-old student who also set himself
afire.
   ``Let us at least try to react to that now, 20 years later _ no
longer by demonstrating, but each of us in our own place and at our
own discretion,'' said the statement released in Prague and London.
   ``Lies and injustice are visible all around us. Everyone of us is
a witness to irresponsible, frivolous, self-seeking
decision-making,'' it said. ``Let us not accept it ... Let us point
out every wrong and let us not allow ourselves to be brushed aside.''
   The human rights organization, formed in January 1977, was named
for the document issued by founding members calling on
Czechoslovakia to respect civil liberties.
   In an interview published in the current edition of the
underground journal Lidove Noviny, former Communist Party chief
Alexander Dubcek denounced the jailing of Havel and others as an
action ``against common sense.''
   ``(Recent) demonstrations are thus a direct reflection of the
policy of the party over the last 20 years ... Socialism is not
threatened by RFE (Radio Free Europe) but by a wrong policy which
ignores social needs and the opinions of people...,'' said Dubcek,
who was ousted after the 1968 invasion.
   In Prague's Old Town Square, Politburo member Miroslav Stepan
told a rally that authorities ``absolutely reject the casting of
doubts'' on the government program.
   Stepan's speech was sparsely applauded by a crowd estimated by
the state news agency CTK at 120,000. Western reporters estimated
considerably fewer people on the square.
   Stepan has been in the forefront of an apparent leadership
attempt to stem mounting dissatisfaction and pressure for reform in
Czechoslovakia.
   He has met in recent weeks with several of nearly 3,000 artists
and scientists who took the unprecedented step of protesting the
detention of Havel and other dissidents Jan. 16 and the police
violence used to break up anti-government protests last month.
   The effort at dialogue has gone hand-in-hand with the crackdown
on known dissenters and stiffened penalties on violating public
order.

   A few veterans opposed President Bush's attendance at the funeral
of Japanese Emperor Hirohito on Thursday, but others said it was
time to leave the war in the Pacific in the past.
   ``It doesn't matter anymore, it's all over with,'' said Joe
Donnelly, of Philadelphia, who served during the Korean War.
   Bush's trip is ``the right thing to do. I think World War II is
over and the world needs to look ahead, the United States needs to
look ahead,'' said retired Adm. J.L. ``Doc'' Abbot of Mobile, Ala.,
who fought in the Pacific during World War II.
   ``I don't think you can carry a grudge forever. We've got to do
business with the rest of the world,'' said Bert Swartz, of Mobile,
Ala., who spent five months in German prison camps.
   ``Regardless of my feeling of what happened at Pearl Harbor,
which was many, many years ago, we have to move forward,'' said
Ralph Mollica, 70, of Littleton, Colo., who was in the Army Air
Corps at Wheeler Field in Hawaii during the attack on Pearl Harbor.
   ``The United States' representation at the funeral of Hirohito
must not be seen as praise for Emperor Hirohito,'' said H.F.
``Sparky'' Gierke, national commander of the Indianapolis-based
American Legion. ``Our nation's leaders must take no action that
would ignore the memory of millions of Americans who endured
terrible hardships on land and sea in Pacific Theater action.''
   Wright S. Swanay, 68, commander of a prisoner of war group in
eastern Tennessee, said the United States had to send someone to the
emperor's funeral, but he believes Bush should have sent a lesser
representative in his place.
   ``I haven't forgotten. I don't know if he's forgotten or not,''
said Swanay, a POW in Germany, referring to Bush getting shot down
himself during the war in the Pacific.
   ``It's universal among those I've talked to, that they're not for
this trip,'' Swanay said.
   California's Veterans of Foreign Wars office received just two
letters opposing Bush's visit, said state VFW Cmdr. James Rowoldt.
   Harry Tanabe of Los Angeles, who volunteered for military service
while imprisoned in a relocation camp for Japanese-Americans, said
the president's visit demonstrates the two countries have reconciled.
   ``I definitely agree with President Bush's trip because both
nations must be able to see each other with an open mind,'' said
Tanabe, 62.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani registered
a political committee Thursday with the city Board of Elections,
clearing the way for fund-raising for a possible run for mayor.
   Dennison Young Jr., an aide, announced the filing, which he said
does not commit Giuliani to running.
   Giuiliani, who stepped down as U.S. attorney last month and
joined a law firm, established a national reputation for prosecuting
political corruption and obtaining the convictions of the leaders of
New York's five Mafia families.
   Polls have indicated that Giuliani, a Republican, has a good
chance of defeating the two leading Democratic candidates, Mayor
Edward I. Koch and Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins.
   The only Republican to have announced his candidacy is Ronald
Lauder, former U.S. ambassador to Austria.

<HEAD>Health Experts Launch `Through with Chew' Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health experts on Thursday urged an estimated
12 million Americans, including 3 million young people, to take a
``Through with Chew'' pledge Saturday and abandon their use of snuff
and chewing tobacco.
   The campaign is aimed especially at youngsters, mostly boys, who
have turned in increasing numbers to smokeless tobacco products in
the false belief they represent a safer alternative to cigarettes,
according to organizers.
   The ``Through with Chew Day,'' following seminars on the dangers
of smokeless tobacco at schools across the nation, marks the fifth
anniversary of the death of Sean Marsee, a star high school athlete
from Ada, Okla. Marsee died at age 19 after a tortuous battle
against mouth, neck and brain cancers. He had used chewing tobacco
and snuff since he was 12.
   At a press briefing, American League President Bobby Brown,
himself a physician, joined Marsee's mother, Betty Ann, and a panel
of cancer surgeons to announce the new campaign. Brown noted that an
estimated 40 to 50 percent of major league ball players use chewing
tobacco and vowed renewed efforts to discourage, though not ban, the
practice.
   Brown announced the establishment of a group called Athletes
Through With Chew, to be headed by Taxas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan.
``Nolan has never used tobacco, and that is the kind of role model
young people should have,'' he said.
   Brown said he hoped the overall educational campaign, sponsored
by the Academy of Otolaryngology _ Head and Neck Surgery, would sway
young people to abandon smokeless tobacco products. ``But I'm not
sure we can get a dramatic drop among current users in the major
leagues,'' he said. ``The addiction is extremely severe. I have a
nephew in his early 20s who has tried repeatedly and can't stop.''
   Byron J. Bailey, president of the academy, said ``Many young
users believe smokeless tobacco is a safe alternative to cigarettes,
but it actually may be more addictive.''
   The academy represents 8,500 physicians specializing in oral
cancer and other problems found among users of smokeless tobacco.
   According to the National Cancer Institute, snuff and chewing
tobacco have regained popularity since the 1970s as the use of
smoking products waned. Particularly disturbing, says the institute,
are indications that many boys are using smokeless products as early
as age 10, and that 16 percent of all males under age 21 use snuff
or chewing tobacco. Fewer than 1 percent of women use the products,
the NCI said.
   The NCI and the academy attributed the growing rate among boys
not only to the notion that smokeless products are safer than
cigarettes, but to
   comparatively lower prices and marketing endorsements by
``macho'' athletes and other personalities. ``In many schools, it is
a status symbol for a boy to have a worn, bleached ring on his back
jeans pockete where he carries his snuff can,'' the NCI noted.
   The academy, citing NCI surveys, said an estimated 3 million
Americans under the age of 21 use snuff, which is finely ground or
powdered tobacco, or chewing tobacco, which is more coarsely ground.
It said the products can cause cancer of the cheeks, gums and
throat, dicoloration of the teeth, mouth sores, bad breath, an
increased heart rate and high blood pressure.
   Michael J. Kerrigan, president of the Smokeless Tobacco Council,
an industry group, disputed charges that the industry had promoted
use among young people. Manufacturers ``have for years stressed that
smokeless tobacco is an adult product,'' he said.
   As for health effects, Kerrigan said that ``whether smokeless
tobacco causes any human disease, including oral cancer, continues
to be the subject of scientific dispute.''

<HEAD>Officials of Group That Restored Presidential Yacht Named in Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Washington bank has filed a $17 million
lawsuit against officials of the nonprofit organization that bought
and restored the presidential yacht Sequoia, alleging that they
committed fraud.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court by the National Bank of
Washington, is the latest blow for the group that has been
struggling to finance restoration of the 63-year-old vessel. The
yacht was to have been turned over to President Bush in November.
The ship is sitting in drydock in Norfolk, Va., with the project's
liabilities of nearly $10 million outweighting assets by more than
$3.8 million, according to the suit.
   The suit asks for the $2.3 million the bank lent to the
Presidential Yacht Trust, as well as interest, attorney's fees and
punitive damages.
   Named in the suit are R. Josh Lanier, executive director of the
trust, and John N. Mcguire, chairman of the trust's board of
trustees.
   In November, according to the suit, Maguire executed a
``preferred ship mortgage,'' under which the trust granted him a
$4.1 million mortgage because he provided the funds to buy the
vessel and pledged his own assets as collateral for the $4.2 million
loan from Signet Bank.
   The mortgage to Maguire, the suit alleges, constituted a
fraudulent transfer. ``John Maguire has already invested in excess
of $4 million and made the trust viable for as long as it was,''
said Ben Cotten, an attorney for the trust. He said the bank knew
Maguire had a prior lien when the loan was made.
   Officials of the bank and its attorneys declined comment on the
suit.
   ``The ship floats, but the suit doesn't,'' John Flannery, an
attorney for Lanier and Maguire, said Wednesday. ``It's all wet.''
   The bank earlier filed two suits against the trust itself in
District of Columbia Superior Court.
   The trust purchased the vessel for $1.5 million and spent $3.5
million on an overhaul. The trust has been in default on its loan
since May, according to court papers.

<HEAD>Former Japanese Officer Says He Saw Bush Plane Shot Down in 1944</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Imperial Army major thinks he saw Navy
pilot George Bush's plane shot down more than 44 years ago, and he
said Thursday the Japanese might have killed the future president if
they had captured him.
   Bush parachuted into the ocean and an American submarine picked
him up.
   ``He must be a man of good fortune to survive that battle,'' said
Yoshitaka Horie, who described himself as a staff officer in a unit
defending the Chichijima Island on Sept. 2, 1944, when U.S. Navy
planes attacked a communications center.
   He said Japanese soldiers were taught not to surrender and looked
down on Americans who did so or were captured. ``Some of more than
half a dozen American pilots captured on Chichijima were ordered by
the generals to be killed,'' he said.
   Bush was in Japan on Friday for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito,
in whose name all Japanese soldiers fought during World War II. Bush
has said he was ``doing what's right'' in honoring Hirohito because
Japan and the United States now are close allies.
   ``Looking Forward,'' a Bush campaign biography published in 1987,
described the Chichijima action and recalled his sorrow at the loss
of the two other crew members of his Grumman Avenger bomber.
   During his inauguration week in January, the president had a
reunion with comrades from the aircraft carrier San Jacinto and the
submarine USS Finback, which rescued him.
   Horie, 74, said in a telephone interview he remembered an attack
in which a plane was shot down and an American flier survived.
   ``He was lucky his parachute landed far off the island and that
he was picked up by a U.S. submarine before Japanese boats
arrived,'' he said. ``If he had been captured by the Japanese, he
might have been killed.
   ``I saw the plane going down and a parachute pop up. I ordered
the navy elements to send their boats and capture the pilot. Until
recently, of course, I wasn't aware that the pilot was Mr. George
Bush.''
   Chichijima, about 600 miles south of Tokyo near Iwo Jima, was a
strategic island and heavily fortified.
   Bush wrote that he managed to drop four 500-pound bombs on the
target after his plane was hit, then headed out to sea before he and
the others bailed out.
   Horie, a retired university lecturer, said Chichijima had about
200 anti-aircraft machine guns and 20 anti-aircraft artillery guns.
He said he was in charge of transportation for a combined army-navy
force defending the island.
   Officials of the Defense Agency said they had no records on the
battle.
   Naotoshi Sakonjo, a retired vice-admiral, said Horie's story
seemed ``generally authentic.'' Sakonjo now is with the Research
Institute for Peace and Security, a private institute in Tokyo.
   Chichijima covers roughly 10 square miles and is home to 1,555
people, most of them involved in fishing, agriculture or tourism. A
navy communications unit and a mine sweeper unit are based there.

<HEAD>Number of Strikes, Lockouts Down in 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers were involved in fewer major
strikes and lockouts during 1988 than in any of the previous 41
years, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
   The amount of work time lost to stoppages also was at a record
low in 1988, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
The bureau's records date back to 1947 and cover strikes and
lockouts involving 1,000 workers or more and lasting at least one
shift.
   Strikes and lockouts generally have been on the decline since
1980.
   Forty major strikes or lockouts began in 1988, involving 118,000
workers. The stoppages that began in 1988, coupled with those that
carried over from 1987, resulted in approximately 4.4 million idle
work days.
   Some 1.2 million of the idle work days resulted from seven
stoppages involving transportation equipment manufacturers and
another 900,000 were from six stoppages in forest products
industries.
   The largest stoppage last year, based on the number of idle work
days, occurred at General Dynamics Corp.'s Electric Boat Division in
Groton, Conn., and involved a council of 10 unions representing
9,000 workers.
   It lasted 71 work days and caused about 639,000 days of idleness.
   Another 9,000 workers were involved in a strike by the Alliance
of Motion Picture and Television Producers and the Writers Guild of
America. It lasted 106 days and caused an estimated 625,000 days of
idleness.
   The longest stoppage to begin in 1988 involved 2,500 tugboat and
barge crew members represented by the International Longshoremen's
Association and employed by companies in the port of New York and
New Jersey. The stoppage began on Feb. 15, 1988, and still is under
way.

<HEAD>Arafat Jokes, Jousts With Israeli Journalists in Unusual Session</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, packing a pistol
and dressed in a military uniform, jousted and joked Thursday with
about 15 Israeli journalists, telling them: ``We are not asking for
the moon.''
   The unsual encounter, arranged by Israeli peace campaigner Abie
Nathan, took place in an Egyptian government guest house flying a
Palestinian flag.
   It came after a week of intense diplomacy initiated by the Soviet
Union and aimed at bringing Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization to the negotiating table.
   ``I hope this will help both of us to understand our points of
view,'' said Arafat.
   His message was that the PLO's quest for negotiations was sincere
and not a tactical maneuver as claimed by Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir.
   But Arafat gave no ground on issues of substance, such as his
demand for a Palestinian state, which Israeli leaders oppose, and
the right of exiled Palestinians to return to their homeland.
   He attacked the Israeli government for refusing to deal with the
PLO. ``To be an ostrich will not serve anybody,'' he said.
   Arafat said he saw progress in what he described as the indirect
negotiations that took place Wednesday when he and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens met separately with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``There is a little step advanced (forward) in the Israeli
position,'' Arafat said, speaking in English. He did not elaborate.
   Waving his arms excitedly, Arafat also said Israel's Cabinet had
authorized the Mossad intelligence agency to assassinate him. He
said the plan was code-named ``Best Hit.''
   Asked if he was worried about his image in Israel, Arafat said,
``I am not worried about my image with the Israeli government. I am
worried about the Israeli people.''
   Asked about his past references to Israel's government as a
``military junta,'' Arafat said Israeli leaders constantly called
him a terrorist. ``You are always calling me a terrorist, terrorist,
terrorist,'' he said.
   The guerrilla leader, wearing a black checkered kaffieh
headdress, was flanked by Mohammed Milhelm, former mayor of the West
Bank town of Halhoul who was deported from Israel in 1980, and
Yasser Abd Rabbo, a member of the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Arafat angrily interrupted an Israeli journalist who told him
that it was ``in your interest'' to stop anti-Israeli violence in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and halt guerrilla
infiltrations from Lebanon. The journalist said this would improve
the PLO's credibility about its desire for peace.
   ``You have to stop the crimes of the Israeli army,'' retorted
Arafat, ticking off figures in which he claimed 619 Palestinians had
been killed and 31,000 wounded, including 3,600 Palestinian woman
who miscarried as a result of inhaling army tear gas.
   The figures were far higher than official and unofficial Israeli
counts, which put the death toll at less than 400 since Dec. 8, 1987.
   Arafat did say, however, the PLO was considering what he
described as an Israeli request for a cease fire along the border
with Israeli.
   There were also light moments, in which Arafat joked about a 1984
law that bans contacts with the PLO. It carries a maximum penalty of
three years in prison.
   At one point, Nathan, who is facing trial for an earlier meeting
with the PLO leader in Tunis, asked Arafat to use his influence in
accounting for five Israeli soldiers who are missing or captured as
a result of Israel's involvement in Lebanon.
   Arafat asked Nathan to meet him later, and then quipped: ``Or
they will punish you if you discuss with me?''
   Arafat also joked with Amira Hassan, a reporter for the Israeli
daily Hadashot, who insisted on asking a question in Arabic instead
of English. ``This is democracy,'' said Arafat.
   ``He is a Palestinian with a sense of humor. The man is quite
funny,'' Israeli journalist Amnon Abramovitch said after the meeting
in an interview broadcast on Israel army radio.
   Representatives from most of Israel's daily newspapers attended
the meeting along with a few foreign journalists. Some Israelis were
ex-military officers, including Amos Gilboa, a former army general
and senior intelligence official.
   Nathan, who arranged the meeting to encourage other Israelis to
join in the dialogue with the PLO, said it was unclear whether the
Israeli journalists violated the Israel ban. He said authorities
have not prosecuted cases in which Israelis attended news
conferences with foreign journalists.
   On Thursday, Israeli authorities banned Arafat's statements from
Israel's state-run television. The Israel TV crew did not attend
Thursday's session but did shoot an earlier news conference.
   Uri Porath, director general of Israeli TV, said Thursday no such
interviews would be allowed ``as long as the state's official policy
forbids it, and certainly as long as there is a law against it.''

   Actor Gene Hackman says he blocked out most of
his past, including his anger at the father who abandoned him when
he was 13, until his 1970 role in ``I Never Sang For My Father.''
   The role of the estranged son opposite actor Melvyn Douglas
prompted a reconciliation with the father who walked out on Hackman,
his mother and his younger brother.
   Hackman said the resentment may have added to his macho image.
   ``Coming to terms with my father's weakness made me understand
that being strong means being honest,'' Hackman said in the upcoming
issue of Parade magazine.
   Hackman said that for a long time ``I did what a lot of
successful people do, which is to take credit for inventing oneself,
as if the past had nothing to do with it.''
   ``But then I saw myself becoming a Frankenstein monster, mouthing
all the cliches of the so-called, self-made man like _ `I pulled
myself up by my bootstraps' and `I've paid my dues,''' he said.
   Now, Hackman said, ``I realize that it's all part of who I am and
that only by accepting everything I have experienced can I remain
open to change.''

   A tax court Thursday acquitted director Franco
Zeffirelli of tax evasion.
   Zeffirelli was accused of failing to report in 1982 and 1983
nearly 1 billion lire, now worth about $740,000. The director
claimed he was a resident of Tunisia during that period and not
subject to Italian income tax.
   The court upheld Zeffirelli's argument.
   Zeffirelli's films include ``Romeo and Juliet.''

   Two women say they became pregnant by Steve
Garvey, and the former baseball All-Star, who recently married a
third woman, says he will accept responsibility if the children
prove to be his.
   A San Diego woman, who declined to be interviewed on camera, said
she recently gave birth to Garvey's child, KNSD-TV reported
Wednesday.
   The other woman alleging Garvey made her pregnant is Rebecca
Mendenhall, a producer for Atlanta-based Cable Television Network.
She was engaged to Garvey, a former first baseman for the Los
Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, during the past year.
   A call to Garvey's office, seeking comment, was not immediately
returned Thursday.
   In an interview broadcast by KNSD, Garvey did not deny the
allegations and promised to assume responsibility for any offspring
proven to be his.
   He said his new wife, interior decorator Candace Thomas, 30, of
Palos Verdes, Calif., knew all about the situation.
   ``I'll live up to my moral obligations, which I feel strongly
about because I'm a Christian,'' Garvey said. The couple were
married Saturday in a private ceremony in Utah.
   Garvey, 40, retired in 1988 after 17 years in the big leagues. He
is divorced from his first wife, Cyndi.

   Despite a ballot-stuffing attempt on behalf of
another candidate, NBC anchorwoman Connie Chung turned out to be the
people's choice in a newspaper poll on who should replace Diane
Sawyer on CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
   After Sawyer said earlier this month she was jumping to ABC, the
New York Post asked readers to vote on a list of 17 candidates,
including one fictional character.
   At first count, another Sawyer looked like the winner, until
suspicious pollsters traced most of ABC anchorman Forrest Sawyer's
ballots to his agent, Arthur Kaminksy. He said the ballot stuffing
was just a joke.
   ``Murphy Brown made me do it,'' he quipped, referring to the fact
the Post included on its ballot the sitcom newswoman played by
Candice Bergen.
   Forrest Sawyer denied any knowledge of the ballot stuffing.
   Chung was declared the winner with 49 out of the 302 votes
declared valid. Leslie Stahl of CBS came in second with 29 votes.

   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott
Abrams says the Reagan administration probably should have ousted
Nicaragua's leftist government five years ago through a blockade or
``possibly even an invasion.''
   Abrams said ``a very good argument'' could have been made for
taking either step after the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in October
1983.
   Abrams, who headed the Latin American Affairs Bureau at the State
Department for 3{ years, outlined his views in an interview with
``Policy Review,'' a magazine published by the Heritage Foundation.
Abrams joined the conservative think tank after leaving government
service last month.
   After the Grenada invasion, he said, ``the president should
simply have said, `Look, we have to enforce the Monroe Doctrine; we
cannot have a communist government in Nicaragua,' and done whatever
we needed to do to get rid of it, including a naval blockade or
possibly even an invasion.''
   Abrams said the administration made a number of other mistakes in
pursuing its Nicaraguan policy but most of the blame belongs to the
House Democratic leadership, ``which put up a fierce, and for the
moment a winning, battle to hand Nicaragua over to communism.''
   Although that was not their goal, Abrams said, ``that was
certainly the effect of their actions.''
   Abrams was particularly critical of House Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, who successfully campaigned against an administration
military aid request last February for the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Wright ``has been one of the leaders of the left-wing caucus of
the House Democrats and has proved to be impossible to work with,''
Abrams said.
   Abrams, who was interviewed by the magazine last October, said
the new administration should seek military aid for the Contras.
   ``If we abandon the Contras, then yes, absolutely, bloodshed will
increase in Central America. ... There will be a significant
increase in violence in El Salvador and Guatemala. The Sandinistas
will increase their support for subversion and for communist
guerrillas in the region. When that happens, you can be sure there
will be a reaction from the military and from the right, which will
produce more bloodshed.''
   Abrams said that Latin American democracies declined to support
U.S. policy in Central America out of fear of a hostile political
reaction internally.
   He quoted a South American foreign minister, whom he refused to
name, as saying that if his government supported the Contras, ``
`Cuban President Fidel) Castro would just flip a switch and we'd
have the biggest student and labor demonstrations that you have ever
seen in my country.' ''

<HEAD>Ex-Paraguayan Requests Visa To Visit United States</HEAD>
<UNK>Eds: New thruout to CORRECT that Stroessner wants visa, not asylum.
No pickup.</UNK>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alfredo Stroessner, the deposed
Paraguayan president living in exile in Brazil, has requested a visa
to enter the United States, a Foreign Ministry official said today.
   The high-ranking official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said in a telephone interview that Stroessner was waiting for a
response to his visa request to join his wife and daughter in
Florida.
   News reports have said Stroessner is afraid of a possible
assassination attempt, but it was not clear if that prompted him to
request the visa.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said,
``As far as we're aware, we have no application for a visa and we
don't expect one.''
   ``We don't expect one because he's been granted asylum in Brazil.
He has his own house there. He has good medical care,'' Redman said.
   Stroessner, 76, a military dictator for 34 years in Paraguay, was
overthrown in a bloody coup Feb. 3 by his second-in-command in the
army, Gen. Andres Rodriguez. Stroessner arrived in Brazil on Feb. 5
and was granted political asylum in this country a day later.
   Stroessner, who spent three weeks in a guest house owned by a
government-run electric company in Itumbiara, 800 miles northwest of
Rio, has said he wants to spend the rest of his life in Brazil. But
news reports said today he is living in fear of a possible
assassination attempt.
   The privately-owned Rio newspaper Jornal do Brasil reported that
Luiz Melzer, federal police commissioner in charge of Stroessner's
security, said the former dictator did not feel safe in his
beachfront mansion in the Atlantic coastal resort of Guaratuba,
where he recently moved.
   Paulo Marra, a spokesman for the federal police, told the AP
today more security guards had been posted around the mansion and
that roadblocks had been put up on access roads. He did not say if
security was tightened in response to fears of an assassination
attempt.
   News reports said Stroessner only takes walks through a back
garden at night, with the garden lights out.

<TEXT>
   Salman Rushdie has been in hiding for 10 days under
a death sentence from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but he has
fulfilled at least one literary commitment: a review of fellow
novelist Philip Roth's autobiography.
   In the review for the weekly Observer newspaper, Rushdie is said
to hint at a feeling of kinship with the American Jewish author,
whose portrayals of his fellow Jews got him into trouble.
   ``In the course of reviewing Roth, who himself had a period when
he was vilified by the Jews, he (Rushdie) says he found Roth was not
just speaking to him but for him,'' Blake Morrison, the literary
editor who commissioned the article, told The Associated Press
Thursday.
   Roth was attacked in the 1960s for his irreverent, painfully
personal descriptions of Jewish life, especially in his novel
``Portnoy's Complaint.''
   Rushdie, born a Moslem in India, has been deemed by Khomeini to
be a blasphemer for what he wrote in his novel, ``The Satanic
Verses'' about the prophet Mohammed and the Koran, the Moslem holy
book.
   The book Rushdie reviewed is ``The Facts,'' an autobiography in
which Roth responds to his Jewish critics.
   ``Mr. Rushdie says this has helped him during his own predicament
when he has been similarly beleaguered,'' Morrison said. ``By
quoting Roth, he gives some indication of his own feelings.''
   But where Roth's fiction stirred debate primarily at the
intellectual level, Rushdie's work has put his life in danger.
   Iran's spiritual leader issued the death call Feb. 14, and
Iranian clerics offered a $5.2 million bounty for the assassin. Most
experts on Iran have advised him to take the threat seriously, and
Rushdie has said he does.
   Rushdie, 4l, reacted with shock and apparent bewilderment last
week when he was telephoned and told of the death sentence. He
dropped out of sight.
   Four days later he issued a terse statement apologizing for any
distress caused to Moslems by the publication of his book. He has
made no public statements since.
   Iran's president, Ali Khamenei, had indicated that an apology
could alleviate the sentence. But Rushdie's words had no apparent
effect. On Wednesday, Khamenei said: ``The arrow has been launched
toward its target. It is now flying toward its aim.''
   Asked to elaborate, a Khamenei aide said the arrow was directed
``toward the heart of this blasphemous bastard, Salman Rushdie. He
must be killed.''
   Rushdie and his American wife, novelist Marianne Wiggins, are at
an undisclosed address, and both have canceled U.S. promotional
tours _ Rushdie to publicize ``The Satanic Verses'' and Ms. Wiggins
to publicize her latest novel, the critically acclaimed ``John
Dollar.''
   Morrison said the review in The Observer would appear Sunday, a
week later than originally planned.
   He said Rushdie telephoned him on the day he went into hiding and
assured him he would write the review. He phoned again this week to
make sure it had arrived in the mail.
   Morrison said Rushdie asked that their conversation about his
ordeal not be publicized, and Morrison declined to say anything that
might hint at the novelist's whereabouts.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is sacrilegious because
it casts doubt on central tenets of the Islamic faith. The book, for
example, portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggests he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather than
receiving it from God.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _ Former pop singer Cat Stevens, who gave up a successful music
career in 1977 after becoming a Moslem, endorsed Khomeini's order.
Stevens, who has changed his name to Yussuf Islam and is a teacher
in London, told Moslem students: ``The Koran makes it clear _ if
someone defames the prophet, then he must die.''
   _ Police in Canada said they received a bomb threat against the
Iranian Embassy in Ottawa.
   _ Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds
Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner in Beirut,
released a statement threatening to avenge the action by Rushdie,
the book publishers and their supporters. The group released a
photograph of the three but did not make specific threats.
   _ A West German government spokesman, Dieter Vogel, said its
credit talks with Iran will not resume until the death threat is
withdrawn.
   _ In the Netherlands, Dutch police have taken precautions to
protect Veen, the publishers of the Dutch translation.
   _ Publishers WSOY in Finland and Christian Bourgois in France
announced they had changed their stances and would publish the
Finnish and French translations.

<HEAD>Residents of AIDS-Infected Area Face Discrimination, Writer Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of an area where more than two dozen
children were infected with the deadly AIDS virus are being pelted
with stones and asked to move away by fearful neighbors, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
   Writing in the government newspaper Izvestia, poet David
Kugultinov urged legislation banning discrimination against people
suffering from the virus.
   ``The mass media has so vividly described the dirt, roaches, mice
in our medical institutions, the low profession level of doctors,
nurses and sanitarians that unwillingly the impression has been
created that in all this the AIDS virus grew all by itself,'' he
wrote.
   In late January, the official media reported that 27 babies and
children had been infected with the virus in Elitsa, a city near the
Caspian Sea, by nurses using dirty syringes. Several mothers of the
children also were found to have been infected.
   Now, Kugultinov said, residents of nearby areas have begun
throwing stones at cars with Kalimkii license plates, ``as if the
cars are spreading AIDS.''
   ``The relationship to students leaving Kalimkii to study in
neighboring republics has sharply changed, voices are calling out,
demanding to separate them from the dormitories,`` he said.
   The poet said that the Soviet Union should follow the example of
the United States in seeking to prohibit discrimination against AIDS
victims.
   After long denying the existence of the disease in the Soviet
Union, officials have acknowledged that Soviets have been infected
and started a campaign against it. New regulations require
foreigners who want to stay in the Soviet Union more than three
months to prove they are free of AIDS.
   Since August 1987 it has been a crime to infect anyone with the
disease, and the official media has reported at least two AIDS
deaths.
   But the country cannot produce enough hypodermic needles and
syringes to avoid reusing them.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.

<HEAD>Afghan Guerrillas Choose Moderate, Hardliner to Lead Interim Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas ended three weeks of
fractious debate Thursday by splitting the top jobs in an interim
government between a hard-line Islamic fundamentalist and a more
moderate philosophy professor.
   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, considered a moderate among the Moslem
guerrillas, was elected president with 174 votes, said sources close
to the assembly. Mojaddidi is leader of the Afghan National
Liberation Front guerrilla group.
   The 440 delegates chose hard-line fundamentalist Rasul Sayyaf as
prime minister. Sayyaf is from the Ittehad-e-Islami rebel group. He
received 173 votes.
   Fundamentalist factions advocate a strict Moslem system while
moderates have pushed for a broad-based government in Afghanistan
embracing Islam as its official religion.
   Under a formula devised by a commission of Afghan field
commanders and scholars, the leader with the most votes became
president and minister of health. The second-highest vote-getter
became prime minister and minister of communication, the sources
said.
   Feuding between hardliners and moderates and between Shiite
Moslems and Sunni Moslems dominated the Islamabad council, or
``shura,'' since it convened Feb. 10.
   A spokesman for the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan said
its moderate leader, Ahmed Gailani, abstained from voting and
exhorted his delegates to the shura to follow their conscience.
   The shura, held at a religious compound on the outskirts of
Islamabad, was closed to journalists except for the final vote
results released late Thursday.
   The Pakistan-based rebel alliance says the provisional government
is to oversee the interim administration of Afghanistan until the
guerrillas can form an Islamic republic of Afghanistan and hold
formal elections in the country.
   Guerrillas have predicted Afghanistan's communist government will
soon fall now that the Soviet soldiers who were helping Afghan
troops fight the guerrillas have left the country.
   The interim government lacks representation of Afghanistan's
largest minority, Shiite Moslems.
   The majority of Afghan Shiite guerrillas live in Iran, and they
boycotted the shura after the Pakistan-based rebels, the majority of
whom are Sunni Moslems, refused to give them the representation they
sought.
   The guerrillas have been fighting Afghanistan's government since
the communists seized power in a bloody 1978 coup. Soviet forces
intervened in December 1979 and, under a U.N.-mediated accord,
withdrew their troops by Feb. 15.
   Afghanistan's official radio accused Pakistan on Thursday of
sending troops to help guerrillas attack the key eastern Afghan city
of Jalalabad.
   Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, claimed 1,600 armed
Pakistanis went to the border area of Afghanistan's Kunar Province
to help in the assault.
   The Kabul government summoned the Pakistani charge d'affaires and
demanded that he ``stop hostile actions against the democratic
government of Afghanistan,'' the radio said. ``Otherwise, the full
responsibility may rest with the government of Pakistan.''
   Afghanistan's official communist media repeatedly have claimed
that Pakistani, American and other ``foreign advisers'' have
infiltrated their country to help insurgents fight the Kabul
government.
   The accused countries deny the charges.

   The music academy gave viewers a mixed message
with its 31st Grammy show, showcasing new faces like Metallica and
Sinead O'Conner on stage but giving awards to veterans like Tina
Turner and Jethro Tull.
   Two new faces who did do well were Bobby McFerrin, who won four
Grammys, including best song, record and pop male vocal performance
for ``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' and Tracy Chapman, who was voted best
new artist, best pop female vocal and best contemporary folk artist
based on her ``Tracy Chapman'' album and the song ``Fast Car.''
   In between awards, Melissa Etheridge performed ``Bring Me Some
Water'' O'Connor did ``Mandinka'' and Toni Childs ``Don't Walk
Away.'' Metallica performed ``One'' amid all the specal effects,
thunder and fire of a concert appearance.
   But when it came time to announce the winners, Turner beat out
Etheridge, O'Connor and Childs for best female rock vocal
performance, while hoary old Jethro Tull took the trophy in the new
category of best hard rock-heavy metal over newer and more radical
groups like Metallica and Jane's Addiction.
   ``We are getting more metal and hard rock members, but we have to
grow in this category,'' National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences president Michael Greene said backstage, explaining the
selection of Jethro Tull.
   Metallica's Lars Ulrich said before the show that none of the
members of his group belonged to the academy.
   Other old-shoe comforts the academy members slipped on for the
televised awards Wednesday at the Shrine Auditorium were:
   _Manhattan Transfer's ``Brasil,'' over Gloria Estefan and Miami
Sound Machine and over the Beach Boys, who stood to receive their
first-ever Grammy, for ``Kokomo.''
   _Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips' ``Love Overboard'' for best group
rhythm and blues performance over The Jets' ``Rocket 2 U'' and New
Edition's ``If It Isn't Love.''
   _U2's ``Desire'' as best rock group performance over the more
adventurous ``I Hate Myself For Loving You'' by Joan Jett and the
Blackhearts or ``Beds Are Burning'' by Midnight Oil.
   But there was a sense of change, at least backstage.
   Henry Mancini, the ``Pink Panther'' composer who has won 20
Grammys and dominated the awards in the early 1960s, lost in two
categories Wednesday night. He had to contend with the presence of
O'Connor, who wore torn jeans, heavy boots and skimpy top.
   O'Connor's nearly shaved head was decorated with a painted
insignia of her favorite band, rap group Public Enemy.
   ``Maybe she slept on a quarter. I don't know,'' Mancini said.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to
hear a petition from a social service group asking Union Carbide
Corp. to pay $600 million as liability for the 1984 Bhopal gas
disaster.
   The case will come up for a hearing Friday, a court official said.
   Legal experts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it was a
legal duty of the Supreme Court to agree to hear the petition filed
by the Association For Socio-Legal Literacy.
   ``The court has already given its judgment, and both the parties,
the (Indian) government and the Union Carbide, have agreed to abide
by the order,'' said a Supreme Court lawyer, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The Supreme Court on Feb. 14 ordered the Danbury, Conn.-based
Union Carbide to pay $470 million to settle the Bhopal case. It was
not clear if the group wants $600 million to be paid in addition to
the $470 million or if it wants the $600 million to include the
earlier judgment.
   Gas leaked from the Indian subsidiary of the company in the
central Indian city of Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984 and killed more than
3,400 people.
   The federal minister for industries, J. Vengala Rao, told
Parliament on Thursday the highest figure offered by Union Carbide
for the disaster was $300 million.
   ``Therefore, the settlement of $470 million was much higher and
it meant immediate availability of finance,'' Rao said.
   Opposition members, shouting ``Shame! Shame!'' walked out of the
house protesting the government support of the judgment.
   Rao made no mention of the petition by the social service group,
which was filed Wednesday.
   The Association For Socio-Legal Literacy filed the petition under
an article of the constitution allowing any individual or group to
ask the Supreme Court to seek constitutional remedies to a previous
judgment.
   The petition said the Supreme Court should not have disposed of
such ``an important case by a one-page order without giving
reasons.''
   The petition said the people have the right to know ``as to what
was the material before the court and what were the circumstances
and reasons to reach a conclusion that $470 million would absolve
Union Carbide of its liabilities and also satisfy the gas victims.''

   Saying that ``the republic is in trouble,'' a
panel organized by the American Association for the Advancement of
Science announced plans Thursday to work with school districts in
four states to find new ways to teach science, mathematics and
technology.
   F. James Rutherford, chief education officer of the association,
said teachers and principals in the school districts will work with
universities and industry to develop a ``blueprint for action'' for
a fresh approach to science and math education.
   ``It's not a project to patch up the system we have now,'' he
said, but an attempt ``to create the schools of the future.''
   Participating in the project are the San Diego Unified School
District; the San Francisco Unified School District; the Green
County and Oglethorpe County Schools in Georgia; the McFarland
Community Schools in Wisconsin, and four districts in San Antonio,
Texas _ the San Antonio, Harlandale, Northside, and Edgewood
indpendent school districts.
   The program calls for up to 25 teachers from every grade level in
each district to create and test new approaches to science
education. The project is supported by almost $2 million from the
National Science Foundation; $700,000 from the Carnegie Corp.; $1.1
million from IBM, and $735,000 from the particpating states.
   Part of an association program called Project 2061, efforts in
the school districts are designed to reorganize science education
around a system that concentrates on training ``habits of the mind''
instead of memorizing vast amounts of detail.
   ``This is an effort to move schools away from their fixation on
teaching mountains and mountains of isolated facts'' about science,
and, instead, to spend the primary and secondary school years
teaching students how to think, evaluate and react to new
circumstances throughout life, said Rutherford.
   Science education in America is failing, he said, because it
concentrates on such things as ``thousands of words the kids are
asked to memorize.
   ``You can cut away a large part of that debris and still get down
to fundamentals,'' he said.
   Deborah Larson, coordinator for the program in Wisconsin, said
new methods of teaching science and math must be developed if
American students are to become scientifically literate. Now, she
said, U.S. schools are doing a poor job of teaching technical
subjects and are graduating students who are not prepared for an age
of technology.
   ``The republic is in trouble,'' she said. ``Illiteracy is rampant
and if we don't bring it under control, it will be the end of life
in this country as we know it.''
   Rutherford announced the school districts at a news conference
during which the association released a study on education called
Science for All Americans, which is the first phase of Project 2061.
   The report analyzes what experts consider to be minimim amount of
science and math that Americans should know to be able to function
competitively in the next century. Rutherford said the study was
designed to define the fundamentals of scientific literacy.
   Project 2061, named for the year that Haley's Comet will return
to the vicinity of Earth, is a long-term effort by several hundred
scientists, academics and corporations to develop a plan to overcome
what is considered to be a serious deficit in science education in
America. The program is directed by the association but supported by
a combination of federal and private grants.
   The study released Thursday established broad outlines for the
redesign of science education.
   ``Sweeping changes in the entire educational system from
kindergarten through 12th grade will have to be made if the United
States is to become a nation of scientifically literate citizens,''
the report said.
   Science literacy, it said, is essential if Americans are to
combat global problems tied to the environment and to nature.
   ``Without the ability to think critically and independently,
citizens are easy prey to dogmatists, flimflam artists and purveyors
of simple solutions to complex problems,'' the study said.
   The report proposes that all high school graduates:
   _Understand how scientific endeavors work and how various fields
relate to each other.
   _Be able to grasp the fundamentals of nature and the role of
humans in it.
   _Acquire mental habits preparing them to be inquisitive, critical
participants in the affairs of the world.

<HEAD>India First Foreign Nation to Aid Super Collider</HEAD>

   India has agreed to provide $50 million toward
the super collider atom smasher, making it the first foreign nation
to commit funds to the $4.6 billion project, a Texas congressman
told his colleagues Thursday.
   Officials of Japan, Taiwan, Korea and several Western European
nations have held preliminary cost-sharing discussions with U.S.
officials, Rep. Joe Barton told the energy research and development
subcommittee of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee.
   Barton is a Republican whose district includes the planned
collider site.
   Last year, Italy signed an agreement to explore collaboration on
the project. India is the first country to make a commitment.
   President Bush has endorsed the super collider and recommended
spending $250 million in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 toward
initial construction.
   The Energy Department has chosen a site around Waxahachie, Texas,
for the 53-mile underground tunnel in which beams of protons would
smash into each other with 20 times the energy of today's most
powerful atomic accelerators.
   Faced with heavy demands for funds for science projects, Congress
last year agreed only to spend $100 million on the project in the
current fiscal year and decreed none of the money could be used for
construction.
   Robert O. Hunter Jr., director of the office of energy research
at the Energy Department, confirmed Barton's disclosure of the
Indian contribution and said ``several hundred million dollars'' is
a minimum estimate for foreign contributions of particle-collision
detectors to the project, but the exact sum won't be known for
another year or two.
   Though Hunter said foreign contributions could be substantial, he
did not repeat predictions of department officials about a year ago
that foreign countries could pay up to half the cost of the machine.
   Such large installations are used by scientists of all nations
and foreign contributions are usually made to speed a project along,
not in return for specific agreements for research time, said
department spokesman Jeff Sherwood.
   The agreement with India calls for a contribution of $50 million
``in kind'' _ that is, equipment or services _ contingent upon a
U.S. commitment to build the collider, Hunter said.
   The $4.6 billion cost is the lump-sum equivalent of all future
federal spending expressed in dollars of 1988 buying power. The
Office of Management and Budget has used a figure of $5.9 billion in
inflated dollars of future years, of which the Energy Department
expects $1.8 billion to come from non-federal sources.
   At least some of the $1 billion being contributed by the state of
Texas will be counted in that $1.8 billion, said Sherwood, but it is
not clear that all of that is for items in the department's collider
budget.
   The project still faces high hurdles in Congress, which must
provide substantial funds for construction this year if the collider
is to operate in 1996, as the department would like.

   A man who tried to become the first person
to cross the Pacific alone in a balloon said Thursday he is
embarrassed he had to be rescued but is confident he'll succeed on
the next attempt.
   ``When I first recognized the Japanese flag on an aircraft flying
beside my gondola, I thought I was safe,'' Fumio Niwa told a news
conference after returning home. ``But I became a bit worried when
no one came to save me for some time after landing.''
   ``Half an hour or so later, I lost consciousness because of
severe seasickness and do not remember what happened,'' he said of
his rescue after more than 10 hours bobbing in the Pacific in the
18-foot plastic gondola.
   Uncooperative winds last week forced the 38-year-old balloonist
to abandon his Pacific crossing and drop into the sea Saturday. He
was less than halfway to his target in southern California.
   A coast guard rescue vessel returned him Thursday to Yokohama,
where he started his flight Feb. 15.
   Niwa, who quit his job with a computer firm to attempt the
crossing, landed in the water about 1,560 miles southwest of Tokyo.
He said he regained consciousness when his gondola hit something.
   ``I looked out the window and there were blinding lights outside,
and I realized there was a ship right next to my gondola,'' he said.
   He was picked up first by a Japanese fishing boat operating
nearby and transferred the next day to a patrol vessel of the
Maritime Safety Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   Niwa said he felt embarrassed by his failure.
   His flight encountered trouble from the start as high-speed winds
that usually blow toward California veered sharply to the north,
forcing him to stay at lower altitudes in slower winds.
   ``On the radio, I fought my navigators' and sponsors' idea to
quit the flight until the very last minute, but I had no choice when
I was told: `You know we are not going to make it now. So why don't
we quit bravely before troubling other people any further.'''
   Japanese officials said it cost about $560,000 to rescue Niwa.
   Asked if he would try the solo crossing again, Niwa said: ``Of
course. I miscalculated and underestimated the winds this time, but
I think I got a taste of it. After reviewing the failure this time,
I can confidently say I can make it next time.''

<HEAD>House Ethics Panel Meets in Wright Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee met in secret
Thursday to begin reviewing an independent counsel's report in the
investigation of Speaker Jim Wright while the Texas Democrat warned
Republicans not to try to make political hay out of his problems.
   The ethics panel, formally known as the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct, met for about an hour to map out its procedures
for considering a voluminous report by independent counsel Richard
Phelan.
   The committee's proceedings were being conducted under heavy
secrecy. Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., made a terse statement
saying only that the committee would hold further meetings next
week. The next session was scheduled for Monday.
   The limited number of copies of Phelan's report were being kept
under lock and key in the committee's offices in the Capitol
basement, and members were allowed to read them only on the premises.
   Wright said he knew nothing about the status of the case or
Phelan's recommendations, but repeated his assertions that the
charges were politically motivated and said the committee had
``wasted their million dollars,'' a reference to the cost of the
nine-month investigation.
   Among formal allegations are that Wright improperly lobbied for a
constituent with whom he had financial dealings, that he used
campaign and taxpayer funds to publish a book on which he received
$55,000 in royalties, that he improperly lobbied officials of the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board and that he accepted use of a Fort
Worth, Texas, condominium at a below-market price.
   Wright said continued Republican talk about capitalizing on his
ethics problems in the 1990 elections could put an early end to
cooperation with the GOP administration of President Bush on the
budget and other issues.
   ``You can't have it both ways, obviously,'' Wright told reporters.
   He said comments on Wednesday by Edward Rollins, director of the
Republican House campaign committee, designating the speaker as his
``No. 1 target'' in 1990, proved that the ethics probe was a
political reprisal.
   ``It really is a little bit amusing,'' Wright said. ``The day
after Bush has Democratic leaders down to the White House and talks
about being friendly and bipartisan on the budget, Rollins comes out
and says that.''
   House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of California amplified on the
warning later, saying, ``You don't politicize the process on day one
and expect people to work with you on day two and day three.''
   Of Rollins, Coelho said Bush should ``jerk his chain'' and subdue
Republicans seeking to jump on Wright's problems for political gain.
House Republicans criticizing the speaker are only making it harder
for Bush to get his programs enacted, he said.

<HEAD>Gov't Condemns Violence After Bomb Hits U.S. Fruit Subsidiary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDDY CUEVAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday condemned
escalating violence in Honduras and said it was increasing security
measures after a bomb damaged the offices of a U.S. fruit subsidiary.
   It was the fourth bombing in a week.
   The president of the Honduran Congress was quoted as saying the
wave of bombings was linked to drug trafficking and was not the work
of leftist guerrillas.
   ``The government strongly condemns the criminal acts that have
seriously injured people and public property, affected social peace
and provoked uncertainty among the population,'' said a statement
issued by President Jose Azcona Hoyo's office.
   It said the government regrets ``the harm suffered by innocent
victims in terrorist attacks that are not usual in Honduran life
(and) undoubtedly are provoked by enemies of the democratic and
constitutional system that reigns in the country.''
   In a radio interview, armed forces commander Gen. Humberto
Regalado said he had ordered security forces to begin
``high-security'' operations to combat the violence in Honduras the
past two months. He did not give details.
   Police have set up roadblocks to check vehicle registrations, and
security forces in the capital have stepped up vigilance at all
public offices.
   The announcements followed a pre-dawn attack Thursday on the
offices of the Standard Fruit Company, a subsidiary of Castle &amp;
Cooke, in La Ceiba, about 280 miles north of Tegucigalpa.
   Three people in a passing car tossed the bomb, damaging the
offices, police said. No one was injured.
   Police said they had no suspects in the attack.
   A bomb ripped through City Hall in Tegucigalpa on Tuesday night,
injuring 10 people and damaging nearly half the structure, police
said.
   Police said the blast destroyed the city's computer, treasury and
finance departments. Mayor Rodomiro Zelaya estimated the damage at
$1.2 million.
   Another bomb exploded Monday night in the building housing
offices of the Interior Department in the capital. No injuries were
reported.
   On Saturday, a crude bomb thrown at the rear of a bus carrying
U.S. servicemen north of Tegucigalpa injured three soldiers and two
Honduran civilians.
   No one claimed responsibility for any of the attacks.
   Carlos Montoya, president of the Honduran Congress, was quoted
Thursday as suggesting the bombings were not the work of leftist
guerrillas.
   ``The recent bomb attacks weren't done by leftist guerrillas, but
rather are related to conflicts of an internal order,'' Montoya told
Tegucigalpa newspapers.
   ``This terrorist escalation in the country has a domestic
character. It's linked to what happened in the Central Penitentiary
and to drug trafficking, not a political-ideological problem,''
Montoya said. He did not elaborate.
   Police on Sunday occupied the Tegucigalpa penitentiary, Honduras'
largest prison, after the governent accused prison officials of
corruption, drug trafficking and trying to foment a riot by 1,500
inmates. Sixty prison guards and officials were arrested, police
said.

<HEAD>Shakespeare Theater Secrets Revealed in London Dig</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 16th graf, ``Bankside contains ...'' with
background on theaters.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Ian McKellen climbed into a large muddy hole
Thursday and cried out, ``To think that the voice of William
Shakespeare echoed from these stones.''
   Around him, archaeologists scraped at the foundations of the
newly discovered Rose Theater on Bankside, where the Bard made his
London debut as an actor in 1592.
   ``The puzzles of the centuries are being answered here _ we are
finding out what the Elizabethan theater really looked like. It was
all guesswork until now because when Oliver Cromwell closed the
theaters in 1642 they vanished into the mud,'' McKellen said in an
interview.
   Duckboards lead to the site at Rose Alley, which commemorates the
name of the theater nearly 400 years after it was demolished.
Traffic crossing the Thames river thunders along Southwark Bridge,
where passers-by idle to stare at the diggers below.
   McKellen was joined by 17 other Shakespearean actors and
actresses supporting efforts to preserve the remains of the Rose,
summoned by Roger Rees, who had the title role in the London and
Broadway versions of ``Nicholas Nickleby.''
   ``When I heard about it, I couldn't believe that the site of the
first commercial theater in central London had been found,'' Rees
said.
   The troupe saw the chalk foundations six feet below the modern
surface, collapsed walls and the presumed site of the sloping pit
beyond which may still be the stage, buried under tons of soil.
   The dig has found thousands of hazelnut shells _ the
Elizabethans' popcorn _ and clay pipes, one with a bowl as small as
an acorn.
   ``That comes from the 1580 level when tobacco was in its first
years of import to England and very expensive,'' said archaeologist
Patricia Price.
   ``We also found these bits of pottery, this wig curler, this stem
of a glass goblet, bones of sheep and masses of oyster shells,'' she
said, displaying a box. ``There were no dustbin men (garbagemen)
then and all the rubbish was buried.''
   Museum of London experts who located and uncovered the remains
after an office building was torn down two months ago, said Thursday
they had only until the end of next week to dig before quitting the
site to allow the construction of a new building to go on.
   But after meeting with developers Imry Merchant Securities,
Harvey Sheldon, the museum's archaeological officer for Greater
London, said some time had been gained.
   ``The new building will go ahead but we will have an extension to
evaluate the site to see what best can be done,'' he said.
   ``Perhaps some of the remains can be preserved. Scholars from
abroad are coming to London to see how the discovery matches the
argument that has gone on for generations: were the theaters round
or many-sided,'' Sheldon said.
   The Rose was thought to have been octagonal in shape but the dig
suggests it had 16 or 18 sides, or was elliptical, a design never
hinted at in contemporary maps or descriptions.
   Bankside contains the sites of three other historic theaters of
the Elizabethan and early Stuart times, the Globe, the Swan and the
Hope, all close together near the Rose.
   The Globe is the most famous because Shakespeare's finest plays
were first performed there in his lifetime.
   His friend, actor Richard Burbage _ believed to have been the
first Hamlet, Othello and Lear _ built the theater and Shakespeare
was a part-owner, entitled to a proportion of the gallery takings.
He describes it in ``Henry V'' as ``this wooden O.''
   American actor-producer Sam Wanamaker, who is reconstructing the
Globe as a Shakespeare performance and study center, joined the
preservation campaign.
   In a letter from Los Angeles published Thursday in The
Independent newspaper, Wanamaker urged the whole of Bankside be
protected as a heritage area and not built over.
   He called the Rose find the ``20th century's most important
discovery regarding the cradle of the great Elizabethan theater.''
   Suzanne Bertish, who has acted in London and New York with the
Royal Shakespeare Company, said as she surveyed the site: ``I think
we are in danger of being very negligent about our great artistic
tradition if this is not preserved.''

   Producers and buyers of burley tobacco each
will be assessed a penny a pound on the 1989 crop, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   The total assessment of two cents per pound is unchanged from
last year and will include 1.66 cents to help pay for the government
program under a requirement that it operate at no net cost to
taxpayers. The remaining 0.34 cents is required by law to help trim
the federal budget deficit.
   Officials said the budget deficit assessment _ 0.17 cents each
for producers and buyers _ is imposed under the Omnibus
Reconciliation Act of 1987, which requires a 1.4 percent reduction
in the level of price supports or an equivalent assessment.

   China has 3,851 centenarians, with the harsh lands
of the far west providing the best environment for reaching the
century mark, a newspaper said Thursday.
   A survey sponsored by the China National Committee on Aging found
that 70 percent, or 2,761, of those 100 years and older are women,
and most live in rural areas of northwest and southwest China, the
People's Daily reported.
   It said nearly a fourth of the total _ 865 people _ come from
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the rugged, sparsely populated
desert area of western China that is home to China's Central Asiatic
Moslem minorities.
   The Uygur, a Moslem minority of about 6 million, led with 802
centenarians, half the total from the minority groups. Tibetans were
second with 134.
   The report said 22.46 per million among China's ethnic minority
groups reach 100, but the rate is only 2.5 for 1 million people
among the Han, the group which makes up 94 percent of China's 1
billion population.
   Those who reach the age of 100 receive free medical care in
Beijing and get an extra pension of about $5.40 a month in the
coastal city of Ningbo, the daily said.

<HEAD>Write-In Candidacy Could Create Problems for Daley's Mayoral Bid</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto staffing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Alderman Ed Vrdolyak made life tough for
the father and now, by jumping into the mayor's race just days
before the primaries, he aims to do the same for the son.
   But Democratic front-runner Richard M. Daley, whose father ran
the city for 20 years, insisted Thursday that Vrdolyak's Republican
write-in candidacy would not siphon off enough votes to keep him
from defeating acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer in Tuesday's Democratic
primary.
   ``I'm going to win the primary and the general election,'' Daley,
the Cook County state's attorney, said at a campaign stop.
   Vrdolyak, 51, a Democrat-turned-Republican from a gritty, mostly
white working-class enclave, announced his write-in candidacy late
Wednesday.
   Daley immediately accused him of trying to be a spoiler without
any real expectation of victory. ``The people are smarter than
that,'' Daley said. ``He thinks he's going to fool the people. He's
not going to fool anyone.''
   Vrdolyak denied on Thursday that he was entering to spoil Daley's
chances. Voters would be foolish to think a Republican ``can go in
and upset a Democratic primary where the two candidates have spent
$8 million and, in five days, upset the campaign,'' he said.
   Most political observers believe too few white ethnic voters _
Daley's core constituency _ would cross over and vote for Vrdolyak
to hand Sawyer an upset victory. Both Vrdolyak and Daley are white;
Sawyer is black.
   The most recent polls published in the Chicago Sun-Times and
Chicago Tribune show Daley, 46, heading into the final weekend
before the primary with a lead of between eight and 12 percentage
points over Sawyer.
   Vrdolyak has beaten the political odds in the past.
   He survived a series of City Council run-ins early in his
aldermanic career with Daley's father, Richard J. Daley, and rose to
the top of the local Democratic heap before defecting to the GOP
late in 1987.
   But few political observers doubt Vrdolyak can muster enough
votes to overtake the Republican Party's endorsed candidate,
61-year-old urologist Dr. Herbert Sohn.
   That despite Sohn's brave prediction that he would end Vrdolyak's
political career and ``be the one that drives the spike through
Count Dracula's heart.''
   Eugene Kennedy, a Loyola University professor and author of
``Himself,'' a biography of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley, said
Vrdolyak's impact on the younger Daley's candidacy would be limited
by a number of factors.
   Most important, Kennedy said, is that Sawyer, 54, does not
command the monolithic black support that installed the late Harold
Washington as the city's first black mayor in 1983 and re-elected
him four years later.
   ``The number of black voters is down significantly. On top of
that,'' Kennedy added, ``a handful of black leaders are working
against Sawyer and for (black third-party candidate) Tim Evans. And
that doesn't even begin to address how strong Daley's own political
organization is.''
   Vrdolyak, however, is not without an impressive organization of
his own.
   During a five-year stint as city and county Democratic Party
chairman and 18 years as alderman, Vrdolyak delivered votes for
himself and state and national Democrats with a consistency matched
by few political peers.
   Even after stepping outside the Democratic party to make a
third-party run at Washington in the 1987 mayoral election, his
personal popularity was such that Vrdolyak still captured 18,000
votes of the 25,000 votes in his ward.

   Soviet soldiers showed their best qualities in
Afghanistan and were a major factor in maintaining world peace, the
defense minister said Thursday.
   Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov praised the military in a special
``Order of the Day'' to mark the 71st anniversary of the nation's
army and navy.
   Moscow streets and buildings were bedecked with red national and
military flags for the anniversary.
   The anniversary came eight days after the last Soviet soldiers
withdrew from Afghanistan, putting an end to a nine-year engagement
that cost 15,000 lives and left about 35,000 wounded.
   ``Soviet soldiers showed again their best qualities when
fulfilling the internationalist duty in the republic of Afghanistan,
during the elimination of the consequences of the accident at the
Chernobyl nuclear power station and of the earthquakes in Armenia
and Tadzhikistan,'' Yazov said.
   Military troops were deployed following the April 1986 nuclear
plant disaster and sent to help victims of the earthquakes that hit
the republics in December and January.
   Yasov said the overall threat to peace has been rolled back.
``This is largely due to the new initiatives of the Soviet state
aimed at radical improvement of international relations, the
U.S.S.R.'s decision on unilateral reduction of its armed forces and
armaments.''
   He said the United States and NATO should take similar actions.

   A shooting attack that killed a
13-year-old girl at her Soweto home may be linked to the controversy
surrounding Winnie Mandela, police said Thursday.
   The killing Wednesday night was the fourth in two months
involving people connected to Mrs. Mandela and her unofficial
bodyguards, known as the Mandela United soccer club.
   Mrs. Mandela's husband, jailed African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela, met for more than four hours Thursday with three
anti-apartheid lawyers at a prison farm near Cape Town. One of the
lawyers, Dullah Omar, said no details of the discussions would be
disclosed.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied media speculation that her 30-year
marriage is in jeopardy because of her estrangement from major
anti-apartheid groups.
   Last week, leading anti-apartheid activists accused Mandela
United members of conducting a ``reign of terror'' in the vast black
township outside Johannesburg and said Mrs. Mandela should be
ostracized.
   Police said the Soweto girl, whose name was withheld, was killed
when gunmen fired on her house with AK-47 rifles and set the
dwelling aflame with a firebomb.
   A few hours before the attack, a woman living in the house was
detained in connection with the stabbing death last week of Maxwell
Madondo, a member of the soccer club. Plice declined to identify the
arrested woman.
   ``The possibility that the attack on the house may have a bearing
on the murder of Mr. Madondo and is possibly a revenge attack is
being investigated,'' police said.
   Madondo's body was found near the house that was firebombed. A
former soccer club member, Andrew Ekaneng, has been charged in the
killing.
   Two other people with links to Mrs. Mandela and her bodyguards
have been slain recently in Soweto.
   Stompie Seipei, a 14-year-old activist, was allegedly beaten at
the Mandela home by Mandela United members. His decomposed body was
found in January. Two members of the soccer club have been charged
in the slaying and the abduction and assault of three men.
   Dr. Abu Baker Asvat, an activist, was killed at his Soweto clinic
last month. Two men have been charged in the shooting death, and
police have said they believe the motive was robbery. However, Mrs.
Mandela has suggested Asvat may have been killed because he had
examined Seipei and other youths who she said were sexually molested
by a Methodist minister in Soweto.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, the senior Methodist official for the
Johannesburg-Soweto region, on Thursday reiterated the church's
denial of the sex allegations.
   ``The church particularly resents recent suggestions that it is
involved in a conspiracy with the police to frame the Mandela United
soccer team,'' he said.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied complicity in any wrongdoing, has
suggested that Seipei is still alive, and has asserted the
controversy results from a campaign to discredit her.
   In another development, police banned a rally Thursday intended
to show solidarity with black detainees who have staged hunger
strikes to protest being held without charge.
   More than 300 people, mostly students, had gathered in an
auditorium at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg
when police officers entered the hall and said the meeting had been
banned.
   Student leaders, faculty members and administrators from at least
five universities have fasted in support of the hunger strikers.
   Hundreds of detainees have gone on hunger strikes at several
prisons across the country over the past four weeks to demand that
the government free them or charge them.

<HEAD>Three PLO Guerrillas Killed In Infiltration Attempt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>

   Israeli-backed militiamen patrolling southern
Lebanon on Thursday shot and killed three guerrillas from a radical
PLO faction who were on their way to attack a target in Israel, an
army spokesman said.
   The Marxist guerrilla group, the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, said in a statement that the three fighters
killed three Israeli soldiers and two Christian militiamen before
they were gunned down.
   The army official said on condition of anonymity that no
militiamen were hurt in the clash, and he made no mention of Israeli
troops being involved.
   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official, also speaking privately,
said the attempted infiltration was ``another example of the
inability of the PLO to fulfill its declared statement of stopping
terror.''
   In a related development, a top aide to Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres urged the Israeli government to reverse its stand and open
talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization if the group
abandons terror.
   Yossi Beilin, deputy finance minister, said the PLO has not yet
met the condition, but he told Israel television: ``If this happens,
we would be ready to talk with them.''
   In clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, six
Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire, including a 16-year-old
girl shot in the stomach, Arab doctors said. The army confirmed five
wounded and said it was checking further.
   At least 385 Palestinians have died in the 14-month uprising,
along with 16 Israelis.
   In the West Bank village of Aqaba, 19-year-old shepherd Mohammed
Mahmoud Kassem was wounded in the face and hands when an explosive
device went off as he grazed his sheep, said doctors at Al Ittihad
Hospital in the nearby city of Nablus.
   Two Palestinians have been killed and a dozen wounded by
unidentified explosives in recent weeks, and the army has launched
an investigation.
   The three PLO guerrillas were killed about a mile north of the
Israeli border in Israel's self-declared security zone.
   A South Lebanon Army patrol spotted the squad about a mile north
of the village of Al Jibbayn and opened fire, the army official said.
   Documents found on the guerrillas' bodies showed they were
members of Naif Hawatmeh's Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, a radical faction of the PLO, the officialsaid.
   The guerrillas carried three Soviet-designed Kalashnikov rifles,
a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, large quantities of grenades,
food and wirecutters, the army said.
   ``They were on their way to attack a target in Israel,'' said the
official, adding that the equipment carried by the guerrillas showed
``they were not picnicking.''
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat renounced terrorism during the Palestine
National Council meeting in November, but the PLO feels this
definition does not apply to military confrontations or attacks on
military targets.
   Thursday's attempted infiltration was the second by a radical PLO
faction since Arafat launched a diplomatic initiative in December
and the United States renewed talks with the PLO.
   On Feb. 5, Israeli troops killed five guerrillas on the northern
border of security zone, and the army said the squad was en route to
attack a target in Israel. Three of the guerrillas belonged to the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a PLO faction.

   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part
of an authorization on Jan. 25 of more than 2 million tons under the
Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Goldthwait said the wheat is for shipment for March. Counting
some left over from a previous EEP arrangement and the Jan. 25
authorization, the Soviets have more than 1.01 million tons still
available under the program.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 3 million
tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term supply
agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec. 31, 1990.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 400,000 tons are equal to about 14.7 million bushels
worth around $60 million at recent U.S. farm prices of $4.08 per
bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Goldthwait said the 400,000 tons of wheat were sold by Louis
Dreyfus Corp., 300,000 tons, and Cargill Inc., 100,000.
   The companies will get subsidies of $22.06 per ton, or about 60
cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.

<HEAD>Students Battle Police; Pyongyang Says Bush Visit Makes War More
Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radical students showered riot police
with rocks and firebombs Thursday despite stern government warnings
and burned an effigy of President Bush. North Korea said Bush's
visit next week will increase the danger of war.
   The students from Chungang University fought police for 40
minutes in front of the Seoul school. They also burned an effigy of
President Roh Tae-woo before dispersing.
   ``Punish Chun Doo-hwan and oust Roh Tae-woo!'' the students
shouted.
   Chun Doo-hwan, Roh's predecessor, stepped down last February and
is under acute criticism for corruption and misdeeds during his
seven-year administration.
   The United National Democratic Movement, an umbrella organization
for more than 200 dissident groups, said it is planning major
anti-American rallies on Monday, when Bush comes for a five-hour
visit.
   The North Korean government newspaper Minju Choson said that
during his visit Bush will be ``examining the preparations for a new
war on the spot and pushing ahead with the U.S. aggressive plan to
carry its Korea and Asia strategy into practice.''
   He also seeks to ``threaten the people who have risen in the
anti-U.S., anti-dictatorship struggle for reunification and defuse
the serious crisis of the colonial rule,'' said the paper's
commentary, broadcast in part by North Korea's official Korean
Central News Agency, monitored in Tokyo.
   ``Bush's visit to South Korea will only result in further
encouraging the South Korean puppets to fascism and confrontation,
increasing the danger of war and permanent division and laying
greater obstacles in the way of reunification,'' the statement said.
   Thursday's clash between students and police followed Roh's
warning that he will not tolerate further acts of violence.
   In a meeting with governing party officials, he reaffirmed a
government plan to clamp down on the protests beginning this weekend.
   Roh said radical groups are trying to overthrow the government
through revolutionary means. He said the government and society must
be prepared to fight the radicals.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., R-Conn., a
leading advocate for medical research during his 18 years in the
Senate, will become head of a new non-profit organization to promote
such research and increase government funding.
   Weicker, who lost his bid for a fourth Senate term by less than 1
percentage point in November, will become president and chief
executive officer of ``Research! America,'' which will open its
doors in Alexandria, Va., this spring, said publicist Jane Miller.
   Weicker would not discuss details of the new organization,
pointing to a news conference in Washington on Monday.
   Terry Lierman, a Washington lobbyist who founded the group, said
the organization will not lobby Capitol Hill, but instead take its
message _ with Weicker as the point man _ around the country to
educate the public and rally citizens' support to put additional
pressure on Congress.
   Lierman, president of Capitol Associates Inc., a Washington
lobbying firm specializing in health-related issues, said the new
group plans to spend about $3 million a year on an education
campaign that will feature Weicker speaking around the country.
   Research! America will act as an umbrella group for a wide range
of academic, fund-raising, industry and research groups, including
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation,
American Association of Universities, American Association of
Medical Colleges, and Upjohn Co.

   Maria Olivia Berrios crossed three
countries, begged for food and avoided cops and robbers as she and
her 16-year-old nephew, Facto Aristes, fled El Salvador.
   But her thousand-mile weeklong trek that ended when she reached
the Texas border Tuesday led to an immigrant detention center, not
freedom.
   On Thursday, she was jailed on $4,000 bail pending deportation
under stringent new rules governing political asylum applications.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service refused to give
further details about her case, and the status of her nephew's
application could not immediately be determined Thursday by the INS.
   ``After all that we've been through, I can't believe we'll be
turned back,'' Ms. Berrios, 33, had said late Wednesday while
awaiting the decision.
   She and with five other Salvadorans had talked to a reporter as
they waited 100 yards from the entrance to the Port Isabel Service
Processing Center, where INS officials were processing asylum
applications.
   ``We don't want to return to El Salvador,'' where her three
children remain, she said with tears in her eyes. ``There are nights
we haven't been able to sleep because of all the shooting that goes
on around us.
   ``Many people can't even go to work because of all the
shooting,'' she said, biting a sweet roll and periodically setting
down a small but apparently heavy bag in which she carried her
belongings.
   ``We'll either be killed or we'll die of hunger if we go back,''
she said.
   Only immigrants who can show they are victims of persecution may
receive asylum; those who come to the United States solely to better
themselves economically are deported.
   Not one of the 51 applications processed Wednesday was accepted,
the INS said. Only eight applicants were being processed Thursday
morning, compared to some 50 Wednesday and 233 Tuesday, the first
day that the INS implemented new rules that call for jailing of
those filing claims deemed frivolous.
   Asylum-seekers such as Ms. Berrios, whose applications are
denied, may appeal to an INS administrative judge but must remain at
the federal compound unless they can secure the $4,000 bail.
   Most, like 20-year-old Freddie Marquez-Rodriguez of Managua,
Nicaragua, arrived only with the clothes they're wearing and can't
afford the bond.
   ``I came here because I did not want to go into the military in
Nicaragua and now I don't know what's going to happen to my wife and
children because I'm not working,'' he said.
   Marquez-Rodriguez, clad in the bright orange prison uniform and
wearing a green Oakland Athletics baseball cap, was one of three
Central Americans detained at the federal camp who agreed to talk to
reporters Wednesday.
   He said he would try to get word to his wife that he was in jail
and would try to get bond money from a friend in San Francisco.
   ``Keeping us in this jail is destroying us physically and
psychologically because we want to work to bring over our families
or to send them money for food and we can't get out of here,'' said
Marquez-Rodriguez.
   He said he went to the detention center Monday seeking asylum
before the new rules took effect, but he said INS officials closed
early that day.
   Marquez-Rodriguez said he knew he was taking a risk when he left
his wife and two small children to come to the United States.
   ``I had to come out of necessity,'' he said. ``All of us who came
here are looking for serenity and for the same advantages for our
children that children here have.''
   Rosendo Lopez, a Rio Grande Valley-area missionary for the
Southern Baptist Convention, was among the volunteers who operated a
soup kitchen just inside the detention center. About 50 volunteers
fed about 1,400 people over three days.
   ``We just wanted to help our fellow man. They really do want a
better life and we just wanted to give them some food as they want
on their way,'' Lopez said.
   Because of the tighter rules and an influx of 500 immigration
personnel into the area, officials believe the many Central American
asylum-seekers will try to enter the country elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Cecil Andrus on Thursday partially
lifted his four-month-old ban on shipments of nuclear waste bound
for temporary storage at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
citing national security concerns.
   But shipments will be allowed only from the U.S. Department of
Energy's Rocky Flats weapons plant in Colorado, and only for the
next six months, he said.
   ``We have not thrown the borders open, and we will not,'' Andrus
said.
   The governor said he had agreed to allow the department to
transfer two railroad boxcars per month from the Rocky Flats site
near Denver.
   An average of four boxcars per month were shipped from the
Colorado plant to the laboratory before Andrus closed Idaho's
borders to waste shipments Oct. 19.
   Lifting the ban on shipments will allow Rocky Flats to remain
open and give the Energy Department time to clear up problems that
have delayed opening of its Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a permanent
waste storage site near Carlsbad, N.M.
   ``I do not relish the job of once again pulling their chestnuts
out of the fire,'' Andrus said. ``But it is obvious to me that DOE
has no alternative short of closing Rocky Flats and precipitating a
national security crisis.''
   Because there already are thousands of boxcar loads of waste at
the INEL, Andrus said, ``12 more really won't make that much
difference to us.''
   Nuclear waste is building up at Rocky Flats, and the plant could
be weeks away from reaching its limit of 1,600 cubic yards of
material, said Rich Marquez, an Energy Department spokesman in
Albuquerque, N.M.
   Colorado Gov. Roy Romer had threatened to shut down Rocky Flats
if waste storage reached capacity.
   ``Sooner or later we were going to bump into the ceiling,''
Marquez said. ``This gives us some breathing room.''
   The INEL is the only facility in the nation other than Rocky
Flats that can accept the waste right now.

   Assistant Defense Secretary Ronald F. Lehman, a
former U.S. negotiator, will be named director of the U.S. Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency and Margo Carlisle, another top
Pentagon official, will be his deputy, Bush administration and
congressional sources said Thursday.
   Lehman was in charge of strategic weapons reduction talks with
the Soviets in Geneva from 1985 to 1988 when he moved to the
Pentagon to take charge of international security policy in the
closing months of the Reagan administration.
   Ms. Carlisle, who is close to Senate conservatives, is the
Pentagon's chief liaison to Congress and like Lehman holds the title
of assistant secretary of defense. She is a former aide to Sen.
James A. McClure, R-Idaho, and was staff director of the Senate
Republican Conference.
   The sources, who declined to be identified, said the nominations
would be sent to the Senate for approval.
   The arms control agency, created by Congress in 1962, usually
cooperates closely with the State Department where it has most of
its offices. Lehman will head a staff of about 250 people and act as
a principal adviser on arms control issues to President Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   However, Brent Scowcroft, the president's assistant for national
security affairs, is considered likely to play a more prominent role
in decisions on how to negotiate with the Soviet Union on reducing
nuclear, conventional and chemical weapns.
   Lehman, 43, has close ties to former Sen. John G. Tower, whose
nomination as defense secretary is facing opposition in the Senate
Armed Services Committee. Lehman worked for Tower when he was
chairman of the committee and later succeeded him as chief
negotiator with the Soviets in Geneva on strategic nuclear arms.
   He apparently won the endorsement of Baker while traveling with
him last week to the 15 countries that are U.S. allies in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. Lehman had been making tentative plans
to return to private life in northern California.
   Baker, in testifying Tuesday before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said he expected the head of the agency to operate
primarily as a technical adviser to Bush rather than as an
independent voice in policy disputes.
   The agency has been headed since last April by William F. Burns,
a retired major general.

   Both the value and tonnage of U.S. farm exports
are recovering at a faster pace than expected three months ago, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   ``Increased demand for U.S. grain has boosted the forecast for
U.S. agricultural exports in fiscal 1989 to $38 billion and 145
million (metric) tons,'' the report said.
   That would mean an 8 percent in export values from $35.3 billion
in the 1988 fiscal year that ended last Sept. 30 and the most since
1984 when they totaled $38 billion.
   However, the actual volume, forecast at 145 million tons, would
be down from 148.3 million tons last year.
   In November, USDA predicted exports at $36.5 billion and a
decline in volume to 136 million tons.
   The new figures represent ``a gain of $1.5 billion and 9 million
tons since the November forecast,'' the report said. ``Larger
prospective corn imports by the (Soviet Union) account for much of
the expansion. Also, competitor corn production and exports are
lower than forecast in November.''

   Dr. Louis Sullivan, nominated as President
Bush's first black Cabinet secretary, won overwhelming support
Thursday from a Senate Finance Committee that showed no interest in
prolonging controversy over his abortion views.
   The panel voted 19-0 to recommend to the full Senate Sullivan's
confirmation to be secretary of health and human services. The vote,
on which Sen. William L. Armstrong, R-Colo., had himself recorded as
``present,'' came after a two-hour hearing in which both Republicans
and Democrats spent much less time on abortion than on sympathy over
Sullivan's apparent sacrifice of $300,000 to take the government job.
   Sullivan did address the subject of abortion, a main point of
controversy in recent weeks, in his opening testimony, reading a
series of sentences that echoed the position taken by Bush. He
apologized to committee member Bob Packwood, R-Ore., for having
``misspoken'' on the subject during a private meeting.
   He was not asked about it during subsequent questioning, in which
senators asked him about such major programs as Medicare and Social
Security that will come under his jurisdiction as head of the
114,000-employee department that administers fully a third of all
federal spending.
   Indeed, the only senator who brought abortion up directly was
Packwood, who said the issue had been blown out of proportion and
the HHS secretary really has little to do with substantive decisions
on abortion.
   ``I do not understand the disproportionate attention,'' said
Packwood, who disagrees with the position Sullivan stated in his
testimony.
   ``My side of this issue has lost ... on the floor of the
Congress,'' said Packwood, noting that, by congressional direction,
few abortions are financed with federal money.
   Saying that the HHS chief has no authority over private
abortions, Packwood told Sullivan, ``The questions that people ask
(of you) might appropriately be asked of the Department of Justice
where we apparently are going to litigate this matter for a number
of years.''
   That was a reference to Bush's assertion that he favors reversal
of the 1973 Supreme Court decision, in a case entitled Roe vs. Wade,
that legalized abortion.
   In his opening remarks, Sullivan had apologized to Packwood for
having ``misspoken'' his position on abortion in their meeting.
Packwood had indicated after that meeting that Sullivan had said he
did not want Roe vs. Wade overturned, a position similar to one
Sullivan had been quoted as taking in an earlier interview with the
Atlanta Journal Constitution.
   He told the committee on Thursday:
   ``I am opposed to abortion, except when the life of the mother is
threatened, or cases of rape or incest.
   ``I support a human life amendment, embracing the exceptions just
noted.
   ``Like President Bush, I would welcome a Supreme Court decision
overturning Roe vs. Wade.''
   As for Armstrong, the Colorado senator said he might vote for
Sullivan on the floor of the Senate but was voting ``present'' in
committee to express his displeasure that Sullivan would not state a
public position on research use of tissue from intentionally aborted
fetuses.
   Sullivan said he had not reviewed the recommendations of a
National Institutes of Health advisory committee convened to study
the fetal tissue issue and wanted to do that before deciding.
   Another controversy that had swirled around Sullivan's nomination
concerned an arrangement with Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he
founded the predominantly black institution's medical school. Under
the arrangement, he could have received about $300,000 in severance
benefits built up over his 32-year association with the school.
   Sullivan told the committee he decided to forfeit the money
because _ ``as the issue was presented in the press'' _ he was
concerned that it would raise ethical questions that might hamper
his effectiveness.
   ``I was also concerned about the image of Morehouse,'' he said.
   ``I know it's a tremendous privilege to work with us, but I don't
think you ought to have go through a toll booth where the charge is
$300,000,'' said Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I.
   ``It is grossly unfair to him and has nothing at all to do with
ethics,'' said Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo. ``You have forgone
benefits ... you have earned. ... It just doesn't seem right to me.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who chairs the committee,
said he, too, was concerned about what appeared to be ``undue
sacrifice'' made by Sullivan, and he told the nominee just prior to
the panel's vote that he would ``probe'' the matter further.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, was the
only member to mention Sullivan's race.
   ``There are a few cynics in this town, not all in the media, and
there are some who will say, `Well, we're greasing it for Dr.
Sullivan, the only black appointed by president, and therefore he'll
get through,'' Dole said.
   He invited Sullivan to comment.
   ``I believe and I hope I was asked to serve ... because of my
qualifications that I bring, both as a physician and because of my
life experiences,'' said Sullivan.
   ``I think the fact that I am black should be incidental. But I
also do represent an important constituency. I believe we have a
government that works best when we have representatives of all
segments of our society.''
   ``I am black and I am proud of that fact. But I am equally if not
more proud of what I have been able to accomplish and what I hope to
accomplish as secretary of health and human services,'' he said.

<HEAD>Red Cross Resumes Aid; Prime Minister Says Army Threat Lifted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Red Cross on Thursday said it has
resumed shipping food and medicine to starving masses in the
southern Sudan after reaching agreements with government and rebel
forces in the region.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, meanwhile, indicated the military had
lifted or extended its ultimatum to the government. The army said
Wednesday it was giving the government one week to begin talks with
rebels and institute reforms.
   Bernard Juler, acting director of the International Committee of
the Red Cross, said the relief airlift resumed Wednesday and that
three aircraft already had reached Wau, capital of the southern Bahr
el-Ghazal region, 625 miles south of Khartoum.
   The Red Cross got approval from the government and the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army in December to airlift supplies to
government- and rebel-held areas in the south.
   Aid has been hampered because rebels have been shooting at
civilian and military flights there, claiming the army uses relief
planes to transport supplies.
   The Red Cross airlift was abruptly stopped two weeks ago.
   ``It was only technical questions and we have overcome that. We
have supplied both the government and the (rebels) with new (flight)
programs and schedules and we obtained the OK,'' Juler said.
   Juler said there would be two daily flights, each carrying about
17 tons of supplies.
   The flights to the government-held towns leave from Khartoum and
those for rebel-held areas depart airports in northeast Kenya.
   The southern rebels took up arms against the government in 1983,
demanding more autonomy and economic reforms.
   Information Minister Beshir Omar quoted Mahdi as saying Thursday
that the military has assured the prime minister that its Wednesday
ultimatum was not final. Mahdi then met with his Cabinet in an
emergency meeting.
   All of Khartoum's papers on Wednesday reported that the army
issued Mahdi a one-week ultimatum either to resign or to reform his
government and begin peace talks with rebels.
   A military spokesman, Mohamed Osman Malik, said the military made
``certain demands'' but he would not characterize it as a coup
threat.
   The warning came one day after Mahdi accepted the resignation of
Defense Minister Abdel-Magid Khalil, who stepped down to protest of
the government's refusal to accept a peace agreement negotiated by a
major political party.
   Communist Party Secretary-General Mohamed Ibrahim Nugud said
Mahdi told political leaders that there was ``no connection whatever
between the resignation of the Sudanese defense minister and the
memorandum submitted by the army.''
   The civil war costs the government an estimated $1 million daily.
Western relief workers believe that in 1988 alone, more than half a
million southerners died from starvation caused by the war or from
the fighting.

   Striking nurses and attendants at a state
hospital returned to work under court order Thursday, relieving
National Guardsmen who cared for patients during the four-day
dispute.
   ``It's unfortunate that a strike had to take place. All parties
know that a strike by state employees is illegal in this state,''
said Superior Court Judge Antonio S. Almeida.
   The Guard was sent home as nearly all the striking employees
reported to work Thursday. ``The numbers are good. This reflects a
complete turnaround from the past couple of days,'' said hospital
director James Benedict.
   Union workers walked out Sunday night over staffing levels. The
state, in an effort to cut overtime, has refused in some cases to
call in additional staff members when workers are sick.
   Local 1350 of the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees represents 650 hospital workers and nearly all
honored the strike.
   About 130 National Guardsmen were called in to help care for the
hospital's 410 chronically ill patients. The soldiers spent much of
their 12-hour shifts bathing, feeding and dressing patients.
   ``I just want to get back to work, back to my regular job'' as a
pipe fitter, said Guard member Robert Johannes.
   ``I'm tired,'' said Mary Eckstein.
   Patients were relieved to see the employees returning, although
some enjoyed the change.
   ``It was sort of a break from the boredom of hospitals. Every day
is the same as the last, especially for some of the shut-ins,'' said
Dan Sherman, 43, a patient for five months.
   Gov. Edward D. DiPrete said Wednesday that workers who failed to
return Thursday morning would be fired. Those claiming to be sick
must provide a medical excuse, officials said.
   ``As of seven o'clock this morning the pickets were no longer
present, staffing at the General Hospital was within normal levels.
We believe (the union) is actively encouraging workers to return to
work,'' state attorney John Breguet said at a hearing Thursday.
   Almeida had ordered workers to return on Wednesday. On Thursday,
he said he was annoyed his order had been violated but would not
impose sanctions.
   Union workers staged a four-day sickout that ended Jan. 31 when
the governor called out the National Guard and threatened to fire
employees who failed to report to work.
   Thomas Romeo, director of the state Department of Mental Health,
Retardation and Hospitals, said the state would try to recoup from
the union the estimated $249,000 spent on the Guard the strike and
the January sickout.

   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp defended his appeals to
liberals and civil rights activists before the Republican Party's
right wing Thursday and invited the conservatives to join in the
Bush administration.
   ``I want you to participate in this administration,'' the
secretary of housing and urban development told the Conservative
Political Action Conference.
   ``Ronald Reagan started the revolution,'' Kemp said. ``I'll bet
you right here and now, today, that George Bush, President Bush,
will consolidate it, strengthen it, broaden it, broaden its appeal.
I hope to bring it into the inner city.''
   The meeting is a gathering of more than 40 conservative groups,
led by the American Conservative Union and the Young Americans for
Freedom, a politically conservative organization for youth.
   Kemp, a conservative who had the backing of many in the audience
when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination last year,
was asked by one conservative supporter about his recent meetings
with civil rights leaders, who are also Democrats. The questioner
asked whether he was overlooking conservative blacks who have
supported Republicans in the past.
   ``I want to visit with all people,'' Kemp responded.
   ``Look, don't worry. Everybody is going to be heard,'' he added.
``It's what you do and who you follow and what kind of ideas you
express that we ought to judge our final results by.''
   Kemp met with several black leaders, including the widow and sons
of Martin Luther King Jr., during a tour of Atlanta neighborhoods
last week.
   After the meeting with conservatives, Kemp departed for his
second trip as secretary, touring shelters and programs for the
homeless in Baltimore and Philadelphia.
   Kemp also commented on the ethics statement he had signed to
accept the Cabinet position, saying: ``I promised on my ethics
statement that I would never, ever, ever make any money again in my
whole life. That's what it feels like, almost.''
   Kemp's wide-ranging remarks also brought him to the subject of
the Federal Reserve's monetary policy where the former congressman,
an avid advocate of tax cuts and supply-side economics, stopped
himself:
   ``I'm not going to get into Federal Reserve Board policy because
that's not my portfolio. I lust for that portfolio, but I don't have
it.''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Protestants and
Roman Catholics attended Peace Day rallies Thursday in Northern
Ireland and expressed hope for an end to violence in the British
province.
   Church bells rang in many towns to support the event, organized
by Belfast city council members from four political parties and a
group called Women Together To Bring Peace toNorthern Ireland.
   In a joint statement, the organizers pledged ``full solidarity''
for peace and an end to all terrorist activity in Northern Ireland.
   Sectarian violence between Roman Catholics and the Protestant
majority since August 1969 has taken 2,722 lives, 93 of them in 1988
and 11 so far this year.
   About 4,000 people gathered outside the Belfast City Hall, many
wearing white badges.
   Other rallies took place in Londonderry, Eniskillen, Lurgan,
Banbridge, Bangor, Greenisland and Whitehead, and a Peace Day
service was held in St. Anne's Church of Ireland Cathedral in
Belfast.
   ``White for peace is the theme of the day, and we urged everyone
to wear something white to show their support for the campaign,''
said Joanne Elliott, coordinator of Women Together.
   Political parties supporting the observance were the Official
Unionist Party, the largest Protestant party; Social Democratic and
Labor, the largest Catholic party, the centrist Alliance Party,
which draws support from both religious groups, and the Worker's
Party, an offshoot of the socialist Labor Party in Britain.
   In London, Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King told a luncheon of
the Association of American Correspondents there was growing
evidence the people of in the province want an end to violence.
   He said the importance of secret talks in West Germany last
October among politicians from both sides was ``that people right
across both communities, far from being shocked and appalled, were
encouraged and pleased and looked to see that process continue.''
   The talks centered on the possibilty of a power-sharing agreement
to run the province, which now is governed from London.
   King said it was too early to predict results, ``but it is
certainly progress.'' He said he had ``no high ambitions for speedy
progress'' and would not set targets ``which some might enjoy
defeating.''

<TEXT>
   Three senators investigating problems on Indian
reservations said Thursday there should be a White House staff
member designated to work primarily on issues affecting native
Americans.
   ``This designation would send a signal throughout the Indian
communities of your dedication to America's first inhabitants,''
Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., and Thomas
Daschle, D-S.D., said in a letter to President Bush.
   The senators, members of the Senate Select Committee on Indian
Affairs, have been conducting special investigative hearings on a
wide range of problems on reservations and within government
agencies doing business with them.
   Saying they wanted to meet with whomever Bush designates soon
after the appointment, the senators predicted their hearings would
produce legislative proposals to correct longtime deficiencies in
government policies toward Indians.
   In the meantime, they said, a more formal, institutionalized
process for coordinating Indian affairs policies could begin at the
White House.
   There was no immediate response from the White House to the
letter. Bush was in Japan for the funeral of the late Emperor
Hirohito.
   The senators said testimony before their committee ``raises
significant concerns about whether the United States is adequately
fulfilling its fiduciary duties to protect the property rights of
American Indians' rights to land, water, forest, hunting, fishing
and mineral resources.
   ``As we are sure you will agree, legal representation is at the
very core of the federal government's trust responsibility to
American Indians. The inherent conflicts facing the federal trustee
arise not only in legal matters, but also in policy decisions.''
   They cited as one major shortcoming in U.S. policy President
Reagan never having appointed anyone to work on Indian affairs
despite establishing a policy of dealing with Indians on a
``government-to-government basis'' and promising to fulfill federal
responsibilities to them.

<HEAD>National Guard Plans to Help Police Battle Drugs; Ministers Seek

   The National Guard of the District of Columbia
is planning to help city police in the fight against drugs in the
nation's capital, but guardsmen would not be used in street patrols,
Guard officials said Thursday.
   Meantime, more than 30 ministers from drug-plagued city
neighborhoods urged Mayor Marion Barry Jr. to put more police on
patrols, and sought a curfew that would prohibit teen-agers from
gathering between midnight and 6 a.m. on streets where drug sales
are most common.
   ``The feeling is, we've had enough,'' said H.R. Crawford, a City
Council member, who set up the ministers' meeting with the mayor.
``The talking is over _ we simply need to see some action. Too many
people are dying.'' Barry was not immediately available to comment
on the ministers' requests.
   City police officials have asked the Guard if it could help in
the battle against the drug trade. Police blame the trade for 60
percent of last year's record 372 killings in the city. So far this
year, 84 people have been slain in the district compared with 52 at
this time a year ago.
   Before the Guard can begin providing equipment or expertise, the
plan must be approved by the defense and justice departments, but
Guard officials said they expect approval and hope to start the
program in the next 60 days.
   Maj. Gen. Calvin Franklin of the D.C. National Guard said the
Pentagon has given preliminary approval to fund a $300,000 project.
   ``We have put together a detailed comprehensive drug operation
and support plan in concert with the district police department that
will help fight the drug problem,'' Franklin said. ``It could
involve the D.C. Guard using helicopters and night-vision devices to
assist in monitoring and detection of illegal drugs.''
   Guardsmen would not be involved in street patrols. ``We would be
concerned about having armed military personnel on the street to get
involved in arresting people,'' Franklin said. ``When you put a
soldier out there in uniform, he would make an ideal target for a
drug operator wanting to send out a signal _ he'd make a target.''
   The plan calls for the Guard to train city police in the use of
night-viewing devices, sophisticated radar systems and other
equipment the police do not have.

   Nicaraguan rebel leader Adolfo Calero testified
Thursday in Oliver North's criminal trial that he hadn't expected
North to make personal use of any of the $90,000 Calero gave him to
help free American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``I had absolute trust in what Colonel North was doing so I was
not intent in demanding an accounting'' for the money, Calero said.
``He said that he had an accounting. We talked about getting it, but
I guess I never got around to it.''
   Prosecutor John Keker asked Calero if he expected North, who is
charged with embezzling $4,300 of the money, to spend any of it on
himself.
   No, said Calero.
   Later, North's attorney asked whether Calero complained to the
government that North ``misappropriated any of the traveler's checks
you gave him?''
   ``Not at all, to anyone,'' said Calero. ``To this day I believe
he acted properly.''
   Calero also said he wasn't disturbed that North gave $1,000 of
the traveler's checks as a wedding gift to Robert W. Owen, a former
aide to North who served as North's courier in Contra dealings. Owen
is to be the next witness Friday.
   In a light moment during a long day of testimony. Calero said he
never took notes at his many meetings with North, adding that ``I
never dreamed I would be here.'' Said U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell: ``We can all say that!''
   Calero also brought laughter to the courtroom when he said he
felt so close to the late CIA Director William Casey that he
referred to him ``very dearly as `Uncle Bill.'''
   Calero, one of the top leaders of the Nicaraguan rebels, known as
Contras, testified that he gave North money in traveler's checks
after the White House aide ``mentioned the need to help rescue
Americans held hostage.''
   The money came from a Miami bank account that had received $32
million in deposits in eight months after Calero gave North the
account number, he testified.
   The money began flowing in, he said, in June 1984, soon after
official United States financial support for the Nicaraguan
guerrillas was barred by Congress.
   ``I informed Colonel North of everything I did,'' Calero said.
``He was the one who listened to all our laments, to all our
problems.''
   The defense tried to show that North's dealings with Calero were
well known in Washington. The Contra leader said: ``Whenever I talk
to agency (CIA) people, if I went beyond what they were permitted to
hear or talk to me about, they would say `see Ollie about that.'''
   Calero spoke highly of North, saying at one point, ``For us he
became sort of a savior.'' At another point, he declared, ``They are
going to erect a monument to him once we free Nicaragua.''
   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan, who has been trying to persuade
the jury that North was merely following orders from President
Reagan and other top administration officials, distributed to jurors
loose-leaf binders of pictures taken of Calero and other Contra
leaders with Reagan at the White House.
   ``The president of the United States had been very outspoken; he
had clearly stated a number of times that we had the support of the
country,'' the Contra leader said. Those sentiments, he pointed out,
were expressed after official U.S. aid was suspended.
   Calero, who was president of the Nicaraguan Democratic Force _
FDN _ was the second prosecution witness at North's trial. As he
waited to take the witness stand, Calero did not look at the
defendant, who was staring at him intently.
   The leadoff witness, Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., testified he had
not known at the time about Reagan administration solicitations of
help for the Contras from other countries in return for increased
U.S. military and economic aid.
   Hamilton said he didn't know then that Secretary of State George
P. Shultz asked an Asian country to provide communications equipment
to the Contras because the rebels' devices were antiquated.
   He also said he wasn't told that Shultz and then-National
Security Adviser John M. Poindexter knew of a plan by a Central
American nation to provide aircraft to help train Contra fighter
pilots.
   And he didn't recall being told that Poindexter's predecessor as
national security adviser, Robert McFarlane, authorized North to
contact ``a senior military official of an Asian country'' to
arrange ``the sale of missiles to the resistance.''
   He said, too, that he was not told that Gen. John W. Vessey Jr.,
then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also met with the Asian
official to arrange the sale.
   None of the countries involved was identified.
   Hamilton, answering questions from Sullivan, said he was not told
of these and other efforts on behalf of the Contras in the 1984-1986
period when direct U.S. military assistance was forbidden by law.
   The defense is trying to show the Reagan administration didn't
tell lawmakers about its efforts to help the rebels by soliciting
foreign donations after the ban on aid. North, who was a Marine
lieutenant colonel attached to the National Security Council, is
charged with lying to Congress about his role.
   ``Sometime in 1985, there was a crisis in Lebanon where American
hostages were taken,'' he said. ``Colonel North talked about that.
He mentioned the need to help reduce the Americans held hostage. I
said I would gladly contribute money I had control of to free those
hostages. ... I gave him money for that purpose.''
   Calero also testified he bought $11 million worth of weapons from
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, whom he met through
North, between January 1984 and early 1985.

   A twin-engine plane crashed into Lake
Constance near the Swiss-Austrian border on Thursday, and all 11
people aboard were killed, including Austrian Social Affairs
Minister Alfred Dallinger, officials said.
   Dozens of helicopters, boats and a West German submarine took
part in international search efforts. Around 6 p.m., seven hours
after the crash, the wreck of the Gulfstream Aerocommander AC-90
aircraft was found about 260 feet below surface, about half a mile
from the shore.
   Waldemar Marquart, a Swiss investigating judge, said in an
interview on Austrian TV that the submarine crew made a video film
of the sunken plane to help salvage teams in their efforts to raise
the aircraft on Friday.
   ``On the basis of the (video) pictures it is quite clear that
none of the people on board is still alive,'' Marquart said.
   Ernst Sperl, a spokesman for the civil aviation authority, told
The Associated Press earlier no hope of survivors existed.
   It was not known why the plane crashed as it was preparing to
land at Altenrhein, just over the border in Switzerland.
   In Vienna, a previously unknown group calling itself the Austrian
People's Army claimed responsibility for the crash in a telephone
call to the West German news agency DPA. The Austria Press Agency
said police were investigating.
   Dallinger, 62, who took over the social affairs portfolio in 1980
and was the longest serving Austrian minister, was among the nine
passengers.
   The two crew members were identified by Renate Moser, a
spokeswoman of the private Austrian airline Rhinethalflug, as pilot
Brigitte Seewald, the wife of the airline's owner, and her co-pilot,
Hans Reiner.
   Lake Constance, also known as Bodensee, lies in Austria,
Switzerland and West Germany.
   The plane was originally scheduled to land at Hohenems in
Vorarlberg, Austria's westernmost province, but was prevented from
doing so by thick fog, Austrian radio reported. The plane had taken
off from Vienna.
   The radio quoted an unidentified control tower official at
Altenrhein as saying the plane had passed over the airport in
preparation for landing and then looped back out over the lake to
fly in on the designated runway.
   He said the crew gave no indication of any problems on board, the
radio said.
   A second Aerocommander belonging to Rheinthalflug reportedly had
to make an emergency landing at Vienna's Schwechat airport in
January 1988, after both engines failed, the Austria Press Agency
reported.

<HEAD>New EPA Head Promises Vigorous Toxic Waste Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William K. Reilly, the new head of the
Environmental Protection Agency, promised Thursday ``vigorous
enforcement'' of toxic waste cleanup cases, saying a hard line is
needed to force polluters to clean up sites voluntarily.
   Reilly said President Bush has made clear in both public and
private comments that he wants strong enforcement of the Superfund
law that provides $8.5 billion over five years for cleaning up toxic
waste dumps.
   But Reilly, in an interview with The Associated Press, also said
the cleanup effort will not succeed without voluntary action by many
of the polluters.
   ``I worry that we won't come close to making a dent in the
national priority list (of sites in need of cleanup) in this century
if we don't find some more creative ways to get people to settle
their obligations,'' said Reilly.
   As of last count, the EPA has listed 1,175 toxic waste dumps as
deserving priority for being cleaned up.
   Reilly, the former head of the World Wildlife Fund and the first
veteran environmentalist ever to head the EPA, said that while he
strongly believes many environmental issues can be resolved through
consensus, he does not believe the Superfund cleanup effort can
succeed without government first wielding a ``big stick.''
   ``I think the problem with Superfund is you want to create a
climate of enforcement that is both certain and severe. ... It needs
an injection of vigorous enforcement to get the attention of people
who won't come to the table,'' said Reilly.
   The EPA's program aimed at cleaning up the nation's toxic waste
dumps has come under repeated criticism from Congress and elsewhere
over use of private consultants, its level of compliance with
timetables and its overall management.
   Reilly said that he, too, has concerns about the operation of the
Superfund program in recent years and has directed an internal
examination of the program including a review of some two dozen
reports and studies that have been done on the program by
congressional investigators and others.
   On other matters, Reilly reiterated that he is confident that
Bush's public promises to give environmental matters fresh priority
are legitimate.
   But he said budget constraints facing the federal government in
general will also have an effect on the EPA and the administration's
ability to deal with environmental problems.
   ``The budget deficit problem is serious. That has got a high
priority and leaves us with making due with less resources than we
would like and that many programs need,'' he said. ``We need to be
very creative.''

   Former boxer Mitch ``Blood'' Green pleaded
innocent Thursday to drug and drunken driving charges. Outside the
court he then stripped to the waist, flexed his muscles and
challenged heavyweight champion Mike Tyson to a fight.
   ``I got him scared to death of me,'' Green declared.
   Green, 31, was arrested Dec. 30 after he smashed his pink 1979
Lincoln Continental into two parked cars.
   State Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman set bail at $2,000 cash
and gave Green until March 1 to post it. She also scheduled a
hearing for that date.
   Driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol is a felony punishable
by up to four years in prison.
   The Dec. 30 accident occurred less than a mile from the site of
Green's early morning street scuffle with Tyson on Aug. 23. During
the fight, Tyson fractured his right hand when he threw a punch that
opened a gash between Green's eyes.

<HEAD>Premier Seeks Power to Fire Plant Managers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Mieczyslaw Rakowski said Thursday
he will ask Parliament for the power to fire plant managers who pay
workers too much.
   Lech Walesa, founder of Solidarity, said he will urge a boycott
of forthcoming parliamentary elections unless the outlawed
independent union is returned to legal status by then.
   Supporters of a free-speech group did a brisk business in
underground newspapers outside the official PAP news agency before
police arrived and briefly detained three of them.
   Rakowski told foreign journalists attending a
government-sponsored seminar he needs more authority over state
enterprises to make sure economic reforms proceed and managers do
not give excessive pay raises.
   ``Today for example, as prime minister, I am unable to fire a
manager,'' he said. ``I think the chief of a concern has such a
right, and I don't.''
   He said some members of the opposition are against the government
having the power to fire a manager who ``drastically abuses
principles of the wage and prices policy.''
   ``The opposition stated that it was a return to the hard hand and
even Stalinism,'' Rakowski said.
   ``Soon I'll be hearing Stalin was my father,'' he declared. But
he said he will seek the power from Parliament ``because I am
against the weakening of the authorities in Poland. ... I
experienced it a few years ago, when our legs were hobbled like a
horse's and then there was a whip trying to hurry us up.''
   Keeping wages from rising faster than prices is one of the
government's major goals, both to fight inflation and to maintain
adequate supplies.
   Former Premier Zbigniew Messner's government gave in last year to
pressure for wage increases when inflation reached more than 60
percent. Economists blame the raises for a buying sprees that made
shortages worse.
   Walesa told a news conference in Gdansk, where he works as a
shipyard electrician: ``If elections are held before we become a
union, if there is no decision about the relegalization of
Solidarity, everything becomes invalid. There will be a boycott and
Lech Walesa will not vote.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban was asked for comment during a
student rally at Gdansk Polytechnic and replied: ``All will be
settled before the elections.''
   Reform of the electoral system is a central topic in talks on
political and economic reform between authorities and the
opposition, which have entered their third week.
   Officials say the government wants its opponents to be in
Parliament so they will share responsibility for unpopular decisions
and so conflicts can be dealt with politically rather than through
protests or strikes.
   Solidarity was born in the labor turmoil of 1980, the first free
union in the Soviet bloc, then suppressed and outlawed after the
declaration of martial law in December 1981. Since the talks began,
the government has indicated a willingness to make the union legal
again.
   About two dozen people who said they were from the newly formed
Movement for Free Speech assembled outside the PAP offices across
the street from Communist Party headquarters and a library featuring
books and periodicals from communist countries.
   They held up banners saying ``Free Access to Radio and
Television,'' ``We Demand Lifting of Censorship,'' ``Stop
Repressions Against Independent Publishing Houses'' and ``We Demand
a Change of the Press Law.''
   About a dozen sold banned underground weeklies, including
Tygodnik Mazowsze, the Solidarity weekly of the Warsaw region, were
sold to passers-by.
   Police watched for half an hour, then confiscated the banners and
detained three young men for about 10 minutes.

<HEAD>Christian Militia Withdraws from Beirut Port</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian militias on Thursday abandoned a
strategically and financially important Beirut port they had
controlled for nearly three years, sources said.
   ``We've closed all our financial operations at the port and
withdrew our fighters. The port now is in the hands of the Beirut
port authority,'' said a source at the command of the Lebanese
Forces Christian militia.
   Customs officials and other government employees have not been
reporting to duty at Beirut port since the militia took control in
mid-1986.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Christian militia will maintain a ``symbolic force near the port to
protect'' the southern flank of its war council headquarters.
   A source at the command of Gen. Michel Aoun, who heads Christian
units of the Lebanese Army, confirmed that the Christian militia has
closed its ``illegal clearing and taxation offices at the port.
   ``There was no real handing over of territory. They withdrew and
we later deployed in the port vicinity,'' the source said.
   Asked whether the army would control activities at the port, the
source said: ``No. It's a civilian port and not a naval base. Port
activities will be carried out by the usual departments in charge of
them.''
   Aoun, who also heads the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, said the withdrawal of the Lebanese Forces from the port
and discontinuing illegal tax collections were conditions for not
renewing clashes between his forces and the militia.
   Aoun's troops and the Lebanese Forces fought in east Beirut and
the Christian heartland Feb. 14, with 82 killed, 200 wounded and
millions of dollars in property damage.
   In an interview with the daily paper Ad-Diyar, Aoun said the
Lebanese Forces have ``turned themselves into a complete state.''
   ``They conclude international agreements and unload hundreds of
millions worth of weapons at Beirut port without the government's
knowledge,'' Aoun said.
   Aoun told a news conference Friday the Lebanese Forces were
collecting $400,000 daily in illegal taxes.
   Aoun's move against the Christian militia drew positive reaction
from his Moslem opponents.
   Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads the pro-Syrian Moslem
cabinet in the dual government, described the Lebanese Forces
withdrawal from the 5th Basin as ``a positive step.''
   Hoss and Aoun have not met since Aoun was named to head the
interim military government by former President Amin Gemayel minutes
before his term expired Sept. 22.
   Pro-Syrian Moslems rejected Aoun's appointment, which violated
the traditional distribution of political powers that gave the
premiership to the Sunnis, the presidency to the Maronites and the
house speakership to the Shiite Moslems.
   In Kuwait, meanwhile, clerics from Lebanon's main religious
communities ended four days of talks with an Arab mediation panel
Thursday after agreeing that political reforms are the key to a
settlement for Lebanon's civil war.
   Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah Ahmed, who heads the panel,
told a news conference that the clerics agreed that a settlement of
the 14-year-old conflict should be based on ``justice, equality,
preserving Lebanon's Arab identity and restoring efficiency to its
(government) institutions.''
   Sabah said ``in the near future, the panel will establish
contacts with all other Lebanese sides.''
   Christians have dominated power in Lebanon since its independence
from France in 1943. Moslems, who make up 55 percent of the
population of 4 million, want reforms that will give them an equal
share of power.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
said Thursday that Israel must agree to talk with the PLO and accept
an international peace conference as the price of renewing
diplomatic relations.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said the Soviets are providing him an
indirect channel to the Israelis through increased contacts set up
this week in Cairo.
   Shevardnadze met separately with Arafat and Israeli Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens in Cairo on Wednesday. He flew to Baghdad on
Thursday.
   On arrival in the Iraqi capital, he told reporters: ``The
prospects of a solution to the Middle East look good and more
realistic ... because of the PLO's peace overtures.''
   Shevardnadze planned to visit Iran after Iraq and then head home,
and Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Shevardnadze
will be granted a rare audience with Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
during the visit. The report was monitored in Cyprus.
   In a speech to politicians in Cairo, Shevardnadze said: ``We
would like the government of Israel to know that once it opts for
the conference and agrees to a dialogue with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, our two countries could take yet another
step toward re-establishing full diplomatic relations.
   ``The beginning of the conference would be a starting point for
resumed relations,'' he said. Relations were severed after the 1967
Middle East war.
   Israel opposes a U.N.-organized conference but has said it would
go to one under the auspices of the United States and the Soviet
Union. Israel, however, has said it will not talk with the PLO,
which it considers a terrorist organization.
   Under the plan proposed by Moscow, the Soviet Union, the United
States and the other three permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council would attend such a conference, along with Israel, the PLO
and other regional parties.
   ``Israel should not be afraid of the conference,'' Shevardnadze
said. ``Our view is that (it) would indeed give a chance for a
historic compromise between the Arabs and the Israelis.''
   During their meeting, Arens rejected the idea. However, he said
afterward the Soviets have a role to play in Middle East peacemaking
even without diplomatic ties with Israel.
   In Jerusalem, Israel's Hadashot newspaper said Arens and
Shevardnadze agreed to advance ties by making the consular offices
in each country permanent.
   In Cairo, Arafat told a news conference that his organization is
pleased with the Soviet stand on relations with Israel.
   Arafat also appeared pleased at the new Soviet-Israeli dialogue,
which is to begin within days with meetings of Middle East experts
from the two countries. Shevardnadze and Arens are to meet again,
although no date or place have been announced.
   Asked about the results of Shevardnadze's meetings, the PLO
leader noted:
   ``Actually, it was indirect negotiations. ... He informed me
about what was mentioned by the Israeli delegation, and no doubt he
will inform the Israelis what I have mentioned.''
   Mayor Teddy Kollek of Jerusalem indicated at a news conference
there on Thursday that he would support formation of an independent
Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank, but would never agree
to any part of Jerusalem serving as its capital, as the Arabs demand.
   ``Not everything the Arabs want they can get,'' Kollek said.
   The head of Israel's state-run television banned broadcast of an
interview with Arafat conducted by the station's reporter for Arab
affairs, the Israel Broadcast Authority said in Jerusalem on
Thursday.
   Uri Porath, the authority's director general, said in a statement
Israeli law bars contacts between Israeli citizens and ``terrorist
organizations.''
   Shevardnadze complained to reporters after the speech about
President Bush's comments relegating the Kremlin to a ``limited
role'' in the Middle East.
   ``The U.S. president said he was not concerned about the Soviet
minister's tour of the region. That is basically quite right,''
Shevardnadze said.
   ``But in the end he made a qualification that I didn't like. He
said the role of the Soviet Union should be limited. That is very
sad because it injects an element of rivalry that is unnecessary.''
   He added with a smile: ``This is my first critical remark about
the president of the United States.''

<HEAD>Tarlazzi To Be Laroche Successor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUZY PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Fashion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian-born Angelo Tarlazzi will succeed Guy
Laroche as haute couture designer at the house of Laroche, the house
announced Thursday.
   Laroche died Feb. 17 at age 67 after a 2{-year bout with cancer.
He personally designated Tarlazzi as his successor. Already
well-known in the fashion world, Tarlazzi heads his own Paris design
firm.
   ``This is the first time a couturier chose a designer to carry on
his work before he died,'' said Philippe Serre, president of the
Tarlazzi company. He noted that the contract was drawn up in
December according to Laroche's wishes.
   Tarlazzi, 45, was in Italy when the appointment was announced and
was not available for comment.
   Tarlazzi will continue to design his own ready-to-wear and
menswear under his own name. With exclusive shops in Paris, New
York, Tokyo and Osaka, his company does $40 million in business
annually, according to Serre.
   Tarlazzi is planning to launch a less expensive line, Tarlazzi
II, to be distributed by Laroche.
   The Italian started his career at the house of Carosa in Rome
when he was l9 and later worked for the house of Patou and other
fashion houses before launching his own luxury ready-to-wear line in
1977.
   Tarlazzi became known for chic knitwear as well as sexy, feminine
cocktail clothes.
   Tarlazzi's style is not expected to veer into the eccentric at
Laroche, which is known for classic sophistication rather than zany
innovation.
   Laroche always chose the practical path of elegance over
experimental designs. His couture and luxury ready-to-wear are
tremendously popular, helping to make the fashion house one of the
most financially successful in Paris.
   ``But don't expect any imitation of Guy Laroche clothes from
Tarlazzi,'' said Serre. ``He will leave his own imprint on the
collections.''
   Tarlazzi's own luxury ready-to-wear collection for next winter is
slated to be unveiled on March 17 during the ready-to-wear showings
for next winter.
   The Laroche ready-to-wear, to be shown March 21, is being
designed by Guy Douvier, who will stay on as ready-to-wear designer,
a job he has filled for the past 15 years.

<HEAD>Army Recruiters Miss Goal for First Time in 8 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: To updated with congressional comment, adds 3 grafs after 7th

<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

   Army recruiters last fall failed for the first
time in eight years to meet their enlistment quotas, and the other
three services are showing similar signs of distress, the Pentagon
said Thursday.
   The Defense Department, in releasing figures for the
October-December quarter, quoted its top manpower official as saying
the shortfall, if it persisted, could jeopardize one of the
Pentagon's biggest success stories of recent years.
   ``We need to act now to head off future recruiting problems,''
said Grant S. Green Jr., the assistant defense secretary for force
management and personnel.
   ``The first step is to work with Congress on military pay and to
restore the value of recruiting incentives, advertising resources
and education benefits. Otherwise, we could begin the chain of
events that led to the serious military manpower problems of the
last decade.''
   President Reagan proposed, and President Bush has endorsed, a 3.6
pay raise for military personnel next year. At the same time, both
would cancel a scheduled cost-of-living raise for military retirees.
Congress has not acted on the requests.
   Last year, Reagan asked for a 4 percent pay increase for military
personnel; Congress approved a 2 percent hike.
   The Pentagon, operating under congressional budget restraints,
expects to spend about $199 million on recruiting this year, down
from $205.3 million in fiscal 1988.
   Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md., chairman of the House subcommittee on
military personnel and compensation, said the federal deficit has
sometimes not allowed Congress to allocate all it would like.
   However, she said strides were being made to improve the quality
of life for soldiers, including approval last year of an increased
housing allowance and money to help military families move their
possessions when transferred.
   The subcommittee planned a hearing on March 1 on the new
recruitment report, she said.
   The Pentagon report gave this breakdown of recruiting for the
first quarter of fiscal 1989:
   _The Army fell short of its goal of 24,143 by 475 men and women,
its first recruiting shortfall since 1980.
   _The Navy signed up 300 more recruits than its 18,900 goal, but
only by calling up early volunteers who had signed up for delayed
enlistment.
   _The Marine Corps mets its objective of 7,100 and the Air Force
met its goal of 11,800.
   Both the Marines and the Air Force, Green said, reported they had
met their goals only by working harder.
   In all, the four services fell 200 recruits short of the combined
quarterly goal of 61,700.
   Green said officials were more concerned about declines in the
number of recruits who signed up under the Delayed Entry Program,
which allows them to delay reporting for duty by up to a year.
   Forty-five percent of the delayed entry enlistment goal for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1 was met in the October-December
period, but that was down from 51 percent in the same quarter in
each of the two preceding fiscal years.
   Green also noted that the Army and the Navy had to take more
less-qualified recruits.
   The Army, the largest of the services, had to accept almost 11
percent of its recruits from the low-scoring Category 4 pool _ more
than double the 4 percent level maintained for the last three years.
   The Navy also reported accepting more Category 4 recruits, about
10 percent overall during the period. The Marine Corps and the Air
Force were steady at less than 1 percent.
   The Category 4 classification includes individuals who scored
from 10 to 30 points on the 100-point Armed Forces Qualification
Test. By law, any individual who scores below 10 cannot be accepted
into a service.
   ``In terms of overall quality, 91 percent of new recruits for the
first quarter were high school diploma graduates, 2 percentage
points below the same period last year,'' Green said.
   Overall, the assistant secretary said the report presented the
first solid evidence of trends the Pentagon has been anticipating
for more than a year.
   ``Unemployment is at a 14-year low; the youth population will
continue to decline through fiscal 1996, and budgetary pressures
remain a concern,'' Green said.
   The Census Bureau says the pool of 18-year-olds has been
declining for several years and doesn't expect it to begin rising
for at least seven years.
   Green also cited congressional decisions on military pay raises
and cuts in recruiting budgets. He said the Army and the Navy were
moving to increase recruiters in the field and to sign up more women.
   The United States switched to an all-volunteer military in 1973.
After years of trying to establish the system and attract
high-quality recruits, the Defense Department finally met its annual
recruiting objectives in fiscal 1980 and had managed to meet or
exceed the goals ever since.
   At the same time it announced the recruiting shortfalls, the
Pentagon said its overall active-duty strength rose from December to
January by 3,250, to 2,124,909. Over the last year, active-duty
strength fell 40,909, largely because the Reagan administration
decided to reduce its forces and have armaments available sooner
than would otherwise have been possible.

<HEAD>DOE Official Says Technology Lacking to Clean Up Hanford</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technology to completely clean up the most
serious radioactive waste problems at the nation's weapons plants
does not yet exist, a top official of the Department of Energy told
a House subcommittee Thursday.
   Troy Wade, acting assistant secretary for defense programs, said
the department was working to develop needed technology.
   Wade specifically said the department is still trying to find a
way ``to deal with'' the aging, single-shell underground tanks
containing highly radioactive sludge at the Hanford reservation in
Washington state.
   Over the past 40 years, more than 500,000 gallons of highly
radioactive waste from the tanks have leaked into the soil at the
reservation.
   While the tanks are no longer in active use, the department has
yet to decide whether it will just pump out the remaining sludge and
stabilize the tanks in place or whether an effort will be made to
remove the tanks.
   Wade's comments came shortly after the head of the General
Accounting Office testified that Hanford and other
defense-production sites operated by the department may be
``irreversibly contaminated.''
   Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, who heads the investigative
arm of Congress, also said he wasn't convinced that the department
had the technical expertise to handle such problems.
   ``Some sites may be irreversibly contaminated and the Department
of Energy may have to place them in long-term institutional care,''
Bowsher told the House Energy and Commerce Committee's
transportation and hazardous materials subcommittee.
   Bowsher said that the department's weapons plants make up ``one
of the more potentially dangerous industrial operations in the
world'' and that, to date, none of the reports issued by the
department ``adequately addresses'' the cleanup of the facilities.
   ``DOE's plan places modernization on a faster track than
environmental cleanup and decontamination,'' Bowsher said.

   Temperatures fell to record lows across the Plains and central
Mississippi Valley early Thursday, and the cold air pushed snow
flurries to the Gulf of Mexico coast.
   Snow was reported across parts of Alabama and northern Florida,
including Apalachicola and Jacksonville. Albany and Elberton, Ga.,
reported 4 inches of snow by afternoon.
   The snow also spread across western and central parts of the
Carolinas while rain was reported along the eastern Carolinas. Up to
3 inches of snow was reported across parts of the north midland of
North Carolina and Nantahala in Macon County reported 5 inches of
new snow.
   Record lows reported by the weather service were 11 at
Batesville, Ark.; 4 below zero at Grand Rapids, Mich.; 7 at
Harrison, Ark.; 13 at Hot Springs, Ark.; 13 at Jonesboro, Ark.; 2 at
Kansas City, Mo.; 16 below at Lincoln, Neb.; 14 at Little Rock,
Ark.; 17 at Memphis, Tenn.; 13 at Mena, Ark.; 3 below at Muskegon,
Mich.; 13 below at Norfolk, Neb.; 7 below at Ottumwa, Iowa; 13 at
Ozark, Ark.; 17 at Pine Bluff, Ark.; and 10 below at Traverse City,
Mich.
   The cold air over the Southeast helped generate a low pressure
zone over the North Carolina coast that was expected to develop into
the type of snowstorm called a ``nor'easter.'' Depending on how
closely it follows the coast, it was expected to produce northeast
winds along the Atlantic Coast and snow over the mid Atlantic region
and New England.
   Winter storm watches were posted from much of eastern Virginia
through Maryland and Delaware into New York City and the southern
New England coast into Friday, with 4 inches of snow expected.
   Lake effect snow fed by the moisture of the Great Lakes fell
along the shores of Lake Ontario. Rochester, N.Y., received an inch
of snow during the morning and Niagara Falls, N.Y., reported 2
inches. Lake effect snow also fell around Chicago and northwestern
Indiana.
   Showers were scattered along the northern Pacific Coast.
Quillayute, Wash., received 0.63 of an inch of rain in 24 hours.
   Gusty wind developed across higher elevations of Wyoming and over
eastern South Dakota. Gusts measured at 60 to 75 mph near Cheyenne,
Wyo., and blowing snow forced closure of Interstate 80.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 10
degrees at Grand Forks, N.D., Brookings, S.D., and Bloomington,
Ill., to 89 at Santee, Calif., outside San Diego. Thursday's low for
the Lower 48 states was 24 below zero at Hibbing, Minn.
   For Friday, snow was forecast across the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast region. Scattered snowshowers were forecast from the
central Appalachians into the eastern Great Lakes. Showers were
forecast along the northern Pacific Coast. Scattered showers were
forecast from northern California into the northern Plateau,
possibly mixed with snow in Montana west of the Continental Divide.
   Highs only in the 20s were predicted from the upper Great Lakes
into the lower Ohio Valley and central Appalachians into the
northern half of the Atlantic Coast; only be in the 50s across
southern Florida; in the 50s and 60s from the central Pacific Coast
through the Great Basin into the central high Plains, the southern
Plains and the Texas Gulf Coast; in the 70s from southern California
to the Rio Grande Valley of Texas; in the low to mid 80s across the
desert Southwest; and in the 30s or 40s across much of the rest of
the nation.

   The coldest air of the winter surged across the Deep South on
Thursday, icing highways and threatening the citrus harvest while
delighting youngsters with rare snow and closed schools.
   Snowflakes reached the beaches on the Gulf of Mexico, and
temperatures dropped below freezing in northern Florida.
Meteorologists said traditional methods of keeping fruit crops from
freezing might not help against the wind-driven cold that pushed
wind chill factors below zero across most of Alabama.
   Businesses closed early in South Carolina, where Gov. Carroll
Campbell also sent most state workers home in the middle of the
afternoon. One traffic death in Georgia was blamed on icy roads.
   Elsewhere, up to a foot of snow fell around the Chicago area and
northwestern Indiana.
   The core of the cold wave dropped temperatures to record lows
across the Midwest and as far south as Tennessee and Arkansas.
Records included 17 at Memphis, Tenn.; 2 at Kansas City, Mo.; 13
below zero at Norfolk, Neb.; 13 below zero at Spencer, Iowa, and 10
below zero at Traverse City, Mich.
   The combination of the cold and gusty wind produced wind chill
readings of 11 degrees below zero at Memphis Naval Air Station in
Tennessee, 14 below at Harrison, Ark., 22 below at Springfield, Mo.,
and zero at Jackson, Miss.
   Lows early Friday were predicted in the upper 20s in central
Florida and the high teens in the Florida Panhandle.
   ``This is the coldest it's going to be since (January) 1986,''
said National Weather Service forecaster Noel Risnychok in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   The cold snap comes on the heels of record highs just last week
that saw Birmingham, Ala., hit 78 twice.
   Flurries were reported in Alabama as far south as Mobile and
Baldwin counties on the Gulf coast. Snow accumulated in northern
Alabama, and sections of two interstate highways near Trussville and
Leeds were closed.
   Slippery roads closed schools in Georgia, South Carolina and
Tennessee.
   Snow fell across northern Florida from Panhandle beaches to
Jacksonville but melted as soon as it hit the ground. Four inches of
snow fell at Athens, Ga. Up to 3 inches of snow fell in parts of
Tennessee. Atlanta got its first snow of the year.
   In Valdosta, Ga., Nancy Robinson, a police desk clerk, said the
last snowfall police could recall in the area was six years ago.
   ``The kids were very excited because they're not used to this,''
she said.
   In Cobb County, Ga., one hardware store store sold all of its
three dozen sleds by the time the first snowflakes appeared. ``It's
amazing. It's just the anticipation of snow,'' said Ken Lindsey,
owner of Acworth True Value Hardware.
   While highways iced up, grocery stores in Georgia reported that
customers were stocking up, and some liquor stores also reported an
increase in sales.
   ``It has been a little busier today,'' said Carol Thompson, an
assistant at a store in Roswell, an Atlanta suburb. ``People are
afraid they are going to be snowed in without anything to drink.
That could be tragic, you know.''
   The men's division of the Atlanta Union Mission operated above
its 300-bed capacity Wednesday night. The Rev. Bernard Weaver said
more than 40 men slept on pads on the floor.
   Forecasters in Alabama predicted crop-saving efforts such as
using helicopters to blow warmer air down to the ground and setting
fires would be of little benefit because of the wind and the
duration of the freezing cold.
   In Florida, enough oranges to fill 65 million 90-pound boxes were
awaiting harvest and could face some damage, along with half the
projected grapefruit harvest of 54 million 85-pound boxes, said
Ernie Neff, spokesman for Citrus Mutual, a growers organization.
   Central Florida growers and farmers braced for the cold as frost
threatened as far south as the northern Everglades.
   ``We're all going to do a lot of praying,'' said Roy Parkes, a
Hillsborough County strawberry farmer. ``It looks like we're going
to be at the mercy of the wind and cold.''
   Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Tommy Irvin said the cold
threatened wheat, peach and Vidalia onion crops. ``I think we're in
for some hard times,'' said Rick Hartley, Toombs County extension
service director.
   Kentucky was still coming to grips with flooding caused by heavy
rain last week. The state had documented more than $18 million in
uninsured damage in 18 counties, and Gov. Wallace Wilkinson said the
damage total was certain to grow.
   In McLean County, the towns of Calhoun, Rumsey and Livermore were
inundated Wednesday when the Green River crested earlier than
expected, marooning some 275 dwellings. About a third of the county
was under water, officials said.

<HEAD>Government Says Indian Troops Will Stay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEXTER CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday it will
not ask Indian troops to leave Sri Lanka until radical violence that
has killed thousands of people is finally crushed.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said it would be ``foolish'' to
ask Indian forces to withdraw before a provincial administration and
police force were established in the violence-plagued north and east.
   ``We don't want to act foolishly just to satisfy the whims of
both Sinhalese and Tamil extremists,'' said Wijeratne, who also is
Sri Lanka's deputy defense minister.
   ``When law and order is established the president will ask the
Indian troops to leave,'' Wijeratne said.
   In July 1987, India and Sri Lanka signed an agreement aimed at
ending the Tamil insurgency that began in 1983 and has claimed at
least 8,500 lives.
   The mostly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 per cent of the island's 16
million people. They say they are discriminated against by the
nation's predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese majority, who comprise 75
percent of the population.
   Militant Tamils have waged a guerrilla war for an independent
nation in the north and east of Sri Lanka, where they are a majority.
   India prevailed on militant Tamils to accept limited autonomy in
exchange for giving up the struggle and sent in troops to monitor a
cease-fire. But the most hard-line guerrillas rejected the accord
and began battling the Indians.
   Sinhalese extremists, claiming the government had made too many
concessions to the Tamil minority, also began demanding the Indians
withdraw and started assassinating Sinhalese officials.
   Neighboring India became involved in the situation because of the
sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils.
   India says about 40,000 of its soldiers are posted in northern
and eastern Sri Lanka. Four battalions of Indian soldiers, about
7,000 men, withdrew from the island soon after Ranasinghe Premadasa
in the Dec. 19 presidential election.
   Elsewhere in the island, police and military officials said at
least six Sinhalese rice paddy farmers were shot and stabbed by
suspected Tamil militants.
   At least 10 others were injured in the attack late Wednesday in
the Sinhapura village, 160 miles northeast of Colombo. The militants
attacked the villagers and set six huts on fire, officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Two Indian soldiers were killed Wednesday in confrontation with
Tamil militants in northern Jaffna town, 186 miles north of Colombo,
said a spokeswoman for the Indian High Commission, or embassy.

   John D. Glover, the FBI's highest-ranking black
official, was honored Thursday by the U.S. Marshals Service as the
FBI announced he will retire next month.
   John J. Twomey, deputy director of the service, gave Glover the
service's Frederick Douglass Award at the U.S. Courthouse in San
Francisco during a Marshals Black History Month ceremony to honor
``his outstanding career and leadership in federal law
enforcement,'' the service said.
   Glover, 50, executive assistant director of the FBI in charge of
administration, is a 22-year veteran who was the first black to
become a special agent in charge of an FBI office when he was
appointed to head the Atlanta office in 1981.
   His rank is just below that of FBI Director William Sessions.
There are two other executive assistant directors.
   The FBI announced Glover will retire March 31 to become a vice
president with the Bristol-Myers Co. in New York.
   Glover will be replaced by Floyd I. Clarke, a 25-year FBI veteran
who has been assistant director in charge of criminal investigations
since 1985, the agency announced. Clarke's successor was not
announced.
   Clarke, a George Washington University graduate, will be
responsible for the FBI budget, personnel administration, resource
allocation, long-range planning and FBI policy development, the FBI
said.

   Police said Thursday they arrested 14 people and
seized 92{ pounds of cocaine to cap investigations of two
international drug rings.
   Investigators believe the suspects seized in the Rome area on
Wednesday and on Feb. 1 were involved in two separate South
America-Italy drug trafficking operations totaling more than $7.4
million, said police spokesman Col. Gennaro Nellio.
   The investigations lasted six months and traced one ring to
Argentina and the other to Colombia, Nellio said. He said both rings
operated about two years and regularly channeled drugs to Italy

<TEXT>
   The National Guard will soon join the war on
drugs in the nation's capital, Guard officials said Thursday, while
Mayor Marion Barry agreed to send additional police officers to city
neighborhoods where the drug problem is the worst.
   District of Columbia National Guard Maj. Gen. Calvin Franklin
said the Pentagon has given preliminary approval to a $300,000
project that will allow guardsmen to aid city officials in breaking
up more than 80 open-air drug markets that flourish in the district.
   ``We have put together a detailed comprehensive drug operation
and support plan in concert with the district police department that
will help fight the drug problem,'' said Franklin.
   ``It could involve the guard using helicopters and night vision
devices to assist in monitoring and detection of illegal drugs.''
   However, no guardsmen will patrol the streets despite the wishes
of some city council members and community activists to have them do
so.
   ``We would be concerned about having armed military personnel on
the street to get involved in arresting people,'' Franklin said.
``When you put a soldier out there in uniform, he would make an
ideal target for a drug operator wanting to send out a signal.''
   Under the plan, the Guard will train city police to use infared
night-viewing equipment, sophisticated radar systems, and other
devices the police do not have.
   The partnership began in November, after city police officials
asked the Guard to help fight the city's growing drug trade. Police
say 60 percent of last year's record 372 killings were drug-related.
Eighty-four people have been killed in the district so far this
year, compared to 52 at the same time last year.
   The plan must be approved by the Departments of Defense and
Justice before the Guard can start providing equipment or expertise,
but Guard officials say they expect approval and hope to start the
program in the next 60 days.
   Meanwhile, Barry agreed to demands from a group of ministers that
he assign 50 extra police officers to neighborhoods where the drug
problem is worst.
   ``I've been delighted that these ministers came here in
partnership with some real concerns,'' Barry said. ``We want these
killings, these shootings, stopped.''
   The ministers also gained a commitment from the city council that
it would draft a bill giving the mayor authority to declare a curfew
in specific areas to prevent teen-age drug dealers from plying their
trade on neighborhood street corners. Such legislation would allow
Barry to flood the areas with police officers.
   But the ministers did not receive a pledge from Barry to declare
a state of emergency in any of the city's neighborhoods.
   ``I'm perfectly willing to take a wait-and-see attitude,'' said
councilmember H.R. Crawford, who helped organize the meeting.
Crawford said he was satisfied with today's actions.
   ``I consider this real action _ a real step forward,'' Crawford
said.
   The city is also proceeding with plans to hire an additional 150
officers, police sources confirmed. However, police union officials
cautioned that these officers will only replace others who are
retiring, and will not increase the number of police officers on the
streets.

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moises Costa da Amaral, who led the
conservative Timorese Democratic Union and helped reconcile
political opponents within the Timorese nationalist movement, has
died in Lisbon at age 50.
   Amaral became ill at his home Wednesday and died en route to a
hospital, the family said. No cause of death was given.
   ``He was a great man respected by all members of theTimorese
community here for his qualities as a fighter for the national
cause,'' said the Rev. Apolinario Guterres, a Timorese priest who
conducted the funeral Thursday.
   East Timor, a former Portuguese colony 400 miles north of
Australia, was invaded and annexed by Indonesia in 1975.
   ``We considered Amaral to be a genuine Timorese nationalist
despite our political differences,'' said Abilio Araujo, leader of
the leftist Fretilin movement in Lisbon.
   Amaral formed the Timorese Democratic Union in 1975. He and
Araujo formed an alliance in 1986 that has worked with Portugal to
promote self-determination for East Timor.
   Human rights groups say more than 100,000 Timorese, about
one-sixth of the population, died in fighting at the time of the
invasion or have perished since from famine or disease.

   A new X-ray security system at Dallas-Fort Worth
International Airport spotted a weapons cache hours after it was
introduced and nabbed a murder suspect in the process.
   A Mexican national was ordered off a Delta Air Lines jet Tuesday
after airline employees discovered 24 guns and 215 rounds of
ammunition in his luggage bound for Acapulco, U.S. Customs officials
said.
   ``We had just begun using the X-ray equipment that same day,''
said Delta spokesman Jackie Pate. ``This guy apparently picked the
wrong day to fly.''
   Customs agents said Anai Portillo-Castro, 28, would be charged
with violating federal export laws, which ban the shipment of
firearms to any foreign country without federal licensing.
   At the time of his arrest, Portillo-Castro was carrying 3.8 grams
of cocaine and $2,554 in cash, agents said. Officials said he was
held in lieu of a $45,000 bond and that drug possession charges also
would be filed.
   He told Customs investigators that the guns and ammunition were
being shipped to a Mexican Federal Judicial Police commandante
there, Customs officials said.
   Portillo-Castro, who lives near Acapulco, was wanted for
investigation of murder in the Dec. 21, 1984, shooting of Juan
Flores Jaimez. A Dallas County grand jury indicted him on a murder
charge in January 1985.

   A judge declared a mistrial in a drug trial
when three jurors made an unauthorized visit to the alleged crime
scene to see how long it took a toilet to flush.
   This particular privy was supposed to be private.
   ``I'm hard pressed not to use the analogy, flushed down the
toilet,'' Superior Judge Robert Bradley said in declaring the
mistrial Tuesday in the case against Nelson Cortez, of Oxnard.
   The jury foreman told the judge the panelists visited an
apartment rented by co-defendant Joel Ruvalcaba to test the truth of
Cortez' testimony.
   Cortez had testified he was awakened by the sound of a toilet
flushing on Jan. 14, 1988, went into the bathroom and was
immediately arrested by waiting police after officers found a bag of
cocaine in the bowl.
   Cortez claimed he didn't know how the drug got in the toilet.
   Ruvalcaba, meanwhile, was arrested in the living room.
   Two jurors tried flushing their own toilets at home to see if
Cortez would have had enough time to get up, go to the bathroom and
get arrested all in the flush of a toilet.
   Not satisfied with the home experiments, three jurors went to the
apartment building on a lunch break last week, posed as prospective
renters to gain access to Ruvalcaba's former apartment and timed the
toilet flush.
   The judge said he had to declare the mistrial because the
apartment visit was ``serious misconduct.'' Jurors had been told not
to visit the crime scene.
   The panel was allowed to continue to deliberate the fate of
Ruvalcaba.

<HEAD>Swaggart Says Donations Saved TV Ministry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evangelist Jimmy Swaggart says his
scandal-rocked ministry has been saved by supporters who answered
his plea for donations to keep his television programs on the air.
   On Feb. 12, Swaggart said that his daily and weekly TV shows
would go off the air on Feb. 26 unless he received hefty donations.
During his program last Sunday, Swaggart said the ministry had lost
$1.5 million in January.
   During Wednesday night services at his Baton Rouge church,
Swaggart said a telethon to raise funds had been successful.
   ``If there are any newsmen out there _ and I know that there are
_ I want to announce that the telecast will go on the air Sunday,
continuing to tell the world that Jesus Christ is coming,'' he said.
   Swaggart confessed to an unspecified sin before his congregation
last year, and that was followed by a New Orleans prostitute's claim
that she had sexual affairs with the evangelist. He was later
defrocked by the Assemblies of God denomination.
   Swaggart also commented Wednesday on a full-page advertisement in
the Feb. 20 issue of Time magazine, purchased by Planned Parenthood.
Half of the page is covered by a photograph of Swaggart when he
confessed before his congregation.
   The ad asks readers to join Planned Parenthood's Campaign to Keep
Abortion Safe and Legal.
   ``America has always been blessed with characters who claim to
have all the answers,'' the ad says. ``The problem is, they don't
always practice what they preach. And hypocrisy can be extremely
harmful.''
   Swaggart said his son Donnie told him the organization had
``directed a $2 million campaign against us.'' He said the
advertisement cost $250,000.
   ``They've got $1,750,000 left, and I'm going to get that,''
Swaggart said.
   William Treeby, an attorney for Swaggart, said the remark was
made in jest and Swaggart had no intention of filing suit over the
ad.
   In January, Penthouse magazine published a story that quoted New
Orleans stripper Catherine Mary Kampen as saying she had an affair
with Swaggart. Swaggart has threatened to sue the magazine.
   Kampen has been arrested in New Orleans on allegations of
shoplifting a $40 dress from a department store nearly a year ago.
   Detectives said Wednesday that Kampen, 38, was booked with theft
when she surrendered Tuesday and later was released on bond. Police
said a guard saw her photo in a newspaper Jan. 31 and recognized her
as the woman who stole the dress.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made his first visit
to the Chernobyl nuclear power plant Thursday and indicated to a
worried Soviet public that he will take a cautious approach to
nuclear power.
   Official Soviet television showed Gorbachev, dressed in a white
robe and hat, touring the site in the Ukraine of the world's worst
nuclear power accident.
   He quizzed workers and officials about its safety, and both the
Soviet president and workers made reference to a previously
unreported incident in which safety equipment automatically shut
down one of the three reactors that still are operated at the plant.
   No details were provided, but technicians said the shutdown
reactor was undergoing repair while Gorbachev was there. The plant
director, Mikhail Umanets, said it would be restarted Friday morning.
   Earlier, plant spokesman Yuri Risovany said in a telephone
interview that three reactors were running during Gorbachev's visit.
The damaged No. 4 reactor, encased in a steel-and-concrete shell,
does not operate.
   Later, at a meeting with nuclear power officials, Gorbachev said
that in making decisions about present and future atomic power
stations, the Soviet Union would be ``strictly guided by scientific
data which should contain the replies to all questions _ technical,
security, ecology, social, and so on.''
   On Monday, the first day of his visit to the Ukraine, Gorbachev
told an elderly woman that officials will consider earthquake safety
before deciding whether to finish a nuclear power plant in Crimea, a
popular vacation area on the Black Sea.
   ``One shouldn't play around in these matters,'' Gorbachev said
Monday. ``It's serious. Don't think we want to trick anyone. We
would only back ourselves into a corner.''
   Officials already have said they will shut down a nuclear plant
in Armenia, where an earthquake killed 25,000 people in December.
   Gorbachev's visit to Chernobyl was symbolic because after the
accident in April 1986 the Soviet public became much more critical
of nuclear power. The Chernobyl accident killed at least 31 people
and released a radioactive cloud that eventually circled the globe.
   Nuclear power officials and plant workers who met with Gorbachev
before the TV cameras told him that the Chernobyl plant is now safe,
that nuclear power is the most reliable form of electricity, and
that the Soviet economy needs it.
   Gorbachev listened soberly, asking detailed questions about
safety procedures and equipment at the Chernobyl plant, which is 80
miles north of the Ukrainian capital, Kiev.
   In December, Nuclear Power Minister Nikolai Lukonin said six
plants or planned additions to existing stations were scrapped
because of fears of earthquake damage or tougher construction
standards imposed after Chernobyl.
   At the same time, reports have increased about health problems
associated with the Chernobyl accident. The weekly Moscow News
reported last week that cancer cases have doubled and that calves
often are born without heads and limbs in a region of the Ukraine
within 30 miles of the plant.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says KGB Man Betrayed By Love For Pasta</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A KGB agent's love for pasta helped tip off
investigators who smashed a spy ring seeking military information
from Italy, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Corriere della Sera said Valery Popov, based in Yugoslavia and
unhappy without good pasta, asked a Yugoslav electronics engineer
working in Italy to get large amounts of the Italian staple along
with microfilm of military secrets.
   Authorities last week announced they arrested the Yugoslav,
42-year-old Giorgio Stancich, who worked in Trieste, a city on the
border with Yugoslavia. News reports said magistrates have also
issued warrants for Popov and another Soviet, both apparently at
large.
   The Milan newspaper said Italian counterespionage agents who had
Stancich under surveillance had their suspicions raised by the
engineer's frequent stops in Trieste grocery stores.
   Tapping his telephone, they heard him talking to a Russian who
lamented he couldn't find the proper ingredients in Yugoslavia to
make the Roman speciality ``bucatini all'amatriciana,'' a dish of
thick spaghetti with pork, the paper said.
   Corriere della Sera, which did not cite its sources, said the
Russian developed his taste for the dish during a previous stint in
Rome, first as a Tass correspondent then as a trade office
spokesman. The Soviet Embassy in Rome has said it never heard of the
people allegedly charged in the case.

   The number of Central Americans seeking
political asylum declined again Thursday under tough new immigration
rules that place most of them in jail.
   Critics of the Immigration and Naturalization Service's Rio
Grande policy said refugees would just be driven to other border
crossing points or go underground.
   Only 10 applicants were processed Thursday, compared to some 50
Wednesday and 233 Tuesday, the day the tougher rules went into
effect.
   Of all those applicants, only two had been granted asylum by
Thursday and the rest were put in barracks at the INS Port Isabel
Service Processing Center here, 15 miles from Brownsville, or in a
Red Cross Shelter in Brownsville.
   They were held on bail $1,000 to $4,000 while they await hearings
before an INS administrative judge.
   The government announced Thursday it is giving $3 million to the
Red Cross to operate the Brownsville shelter.
   Hundreds of INS officials have been sent to the Rio Grande Valley
to process cases the day they are submitted and weed out
applications the agency says are made by Central Americans coming to
the United States for economic, not political reasons.
   Under INS policy that took effect Tuesday, immigrants applying
for asylum in south Texas must remain in the area until their cases
are processed, and those found to have submitted false or frivolous
claims are jailed.
   Previously, most immigrants remained free while they awaited
processing, appeals or deportation.
   Among the 625 immigrants held at Bayview was Juan Bautista
Sanchez-Sanchez, 28, who said he fled Nicaragua after he was
arrested and beaten because of his participation in marches against
the leftist Sandinista government.
   Sanchez-Sanchez said his application was denied because INS
adjudicators did not believe his claims that the government of
President Daniel Ortega would jail him or kill him if he returned.
   ``They want us to get papers signed by Daniel that they beat us
up,'' Sanchez-Sanchez said. ``If they send me back to Nicaragua,
they'll probably put me in jail for 30 years on treason charges.''
   The two granted asylum the first day were a 32-year-old former
construction worker from Managua, who plans to settle in Miami, and
a 65-year-old Nicaraguan businessman and accountant living in
Brownsville, according to the INS.
   ``It was felt by the examiner that they did meet the criteria,
and if they were forced to return to their country they faced a
well-founded fear of persecution,'' INS spokesman Virginia Kice said.
   INS officials and attorneys representing Central Americans
seeking asylum said the dwindling number of applicants may mean that
they are going underground and taking their chances getting to their
destination in the United States.
   ``Nobody is coming to apply for asylum and that's sort of
predictable when 99 percent of these folks are being thrown in jail
here, so obviously people are going underground and they are not
going to be going through the system anymore, which is a tragedy,''
said Mark Schneider, an attorney with the Harlingen-based Proyecto
Libertad, which represents Central Americans.
   ``We really don't believe this repressive policy here in the Rio
Grande Valley is going to do anything to stop refugees from coming
to the United States.''
   INS officials hope that the word will spread to Central America
that refugees will face a tougher battle getting into the United
States.
   Ms. Kice said the number of Central Americans entering the United
States through Brownsville would decrease or shift to another area.
   Since last spring, more than 100,000 Central Americans have used
the Rio Grande Valley as their gateway to the United States.
   Sanchez-Sanchez said more Central Americans would continue to
travel to the United States even if it meant they would be jailed.
``They will be coming not only for economic reasons, but for
political reasons and I think they will come if I tell them that
even if they get put in jail here, they will not get beaten up,'' he
said.

   A South African government
delegation discussed a regional peace accord in Luanda, Angola, on
Thursday, marking the first official South African visit to Angola
since its independence in 1975.
   The talks, to continue through Friday, are expected to focus on
Marxist Angola's complaint that South African troops invaded its
territory two weeks ago to support UNITA rebels. South Africa denied
it.
   Delegation chief Neil van Heerden, a Foreign Affairs Department
official, told journalists in Luanda possible prisoner exchanges
also would be discussed.
   Under a U.S.-mediated peace agreement signed in December, South
Africa agreed to halt aid to UNITA _ the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola _ and grant independence to Namibia in
exchange for the phased withdrawal of an estimated 50,000 Cuban
troops from Angola.
   The agreement established a joint monitoring commission of South
African, Cuban and Angolan officials, with the United States and the
Soviet Union authorized to serve as observers.
   The Luanda meeting is the first substantive session of the
monitoring commission, which discussed only procedural matters
previously.
   Also visiting Luanda on Thursday was Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
leader of the Anglican Church in South Africa.
   Tutu, completing a clerical visit, told a news conference the
African National Congress guerrilla movement was ``ready and
willing'' to dismantle its training camps in Angola as part of the
peace initiative, the South African Press Association reported.
   The agency quoted Tutu as saying ANC officials in Angola told him
they did not want to be seen as an obstacle to Namibia's
independence.

   Pro-Iranian kidnappers of three Americans
issued a statement Thursday vowing revenge on author Salman Rushdie
and his publishers for insulting Islam, but did not threaten harm to
the captives.
   The kidnappers, who call themselves Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, made the threat in an Arabic-language
statement delivered to a Western news agency with a photograph of
hostages Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.
   They pledged ``revenge on all those who took part in strong and
ferocious campaigns against Islam ... all institutions and
organizations that insulted in one way or another'' the prophet
Mohammed and his family through Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's 88-year-old Shiite Moslem
patriarch, has ordered his followers to kill Rushdie.
   Steen, Polhill and Turner, kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the
campus of Beirut University College, were shown from the knees up
seated on what appeared to be a bed, looking directly into the
camera.
   Polhill's left arm and hand were thinner than in a picture
released 14 months ago and his left sleeve was pulled up to the
elbow, showing what might be a deformity, but he was smiling.
   Turner, 42, sat on Polhill's left clad in a striped sweater and
dark trousers. Steen, 49, was on Turner's left in a dark track suit.
   Steen, who is from Boston, taught journalism at the college.
Polhill, 54, of New York, was assistant professor of business and
Turner, of Boise, Idaho, taught mathematics and computer science.
   They and six other Americans are among the 15 Western hostages in
Lebanon. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Turner's wife, Badr, who knows all three men, said of Polhill's
arm: ``Maybe it's a shadow in the picture. I'm not aware that he had
a deformity in his left arm and hand.''
   She said the three captives have nothing to do with what the
captors are saying.''
   ``My husband looked fine, but I'm worried about their
psychological well-being,'' Mrs. Turner, who is Lebanese, said in a
telephone interview. ``We're suffering without them.'
   Neither Polhill's wife, Ferial, nor Steen's wife, Virginia Rose,
could be reached for comment.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said,
``We hold the kidnappers fully responsible for the safety and
welfare of all the hostages. The hostages are innocent victims. They
should be freed immediately and unconditionally.''
   In their statement, the abductors said their group had
``persistently sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages
issue, in accordance with its principles and to show its good
intentioins in light of international detente.''
   ``But it seems that Imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslems
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the
price of living in the shadow of international detente,'' the
statement said. ``We are going to shatter their dreams and foil
their schemes.
   ``American Imperialism and international Zionism should realize
that by supporting the ugly contents of The Satanic Verses they have
linked the destiny of their interests with the fate that awaits the
so-called Indian author of the book as well as promoters of the
anti-Islam campaign.''
   The captors urged ``Moslems all over the world to stand against
the laws of the jungle so that advocates of these laws would realize
that real human values ... lie in spiritual religions and not in the
jungle's system.''
   Rushdie's book is ``the worst type of insult to Islam's
sacredness in general and the sacredness of ... Islam's prophet in
particular,'' part of a ``serious and wide-ranging programs under
way to strike against Islam because it is the force that fights
moral and humanitarian degeneration,'' the kidnappers said.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by portraying
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,
the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.
   An-Nahar, an independent Beirut newspaper, said efforts to free
the 15 hostages were undermined by the strain in Iran's relations
with the 12-nation European Economic Community caused by Khomeini's
execution order. It did not attribute the report.
   Reaction to Khomeini's death sentence has been mixed among
Moslems in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group believed to be the umbrella for
Shiite extremists who hold most or all of the hostages, said a
statement Khomeini's decree was ``just'' and added:
   ``The publication of this book comes against a Zionist background
that manifests malicious intentions scheming to defame Islam. This
is also the purpose of the current campaign in the West,
particularly in the United States and Britain.''
   Hasan Saab, adviser to Sunni Moslem grand mufti Sheik Hassan
Khaled, declared: ``Islam does not allow the killing of man without
a trial. The Koran teaches us that the unjustified taking of one
life is tantamount to killing the whole world.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Steps Into IRA Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh stepped
Thursday into the controversy over whether political asylum should
be granted to Irish Republican Army member convicted in Britain of
killing a British soldier.
   Thornburgh got involved in the case of Joe Doherty _ who has been
in federal prison in Manhattan since FBI agents arrested him June
28, 1983 _ at the request of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which wants him deported, said Dave Runkel, a spokesman for
the attorney general.
   ``He was asked to by the INS, and he decided to take a look at
it,'' Runkel said.
   At issue is a Board of Immigration Appeals decision last Nov. 14
that Doherty could reopen his request for asylum in the United
States and remanding that request to an INS judge.
   Had Thornburgh stayed out of it, Doherty could have pursued his
search for asylum with the judge, Justice Department spokesman Loye
Miller said.
   Doherty, who was convicted with three others of the killing that
occurred during a gunfight between British soldiers and IRA members
who had planned to ambush a British Army patrol in 1980, broke out
of a maximum security prison in Northern Ireland more than six years
ago.
   He contends he is not a terrorist or a murderer, but a soldier
engaged in war, and he is seeking asylum on the grounds that he
would be subject to persecution if he were sent to Britain.
   Stephen A. Somerstein, one of Doherty's New York-based attorneys,
criticized Thornburgh's involvement.
   ``We had requested that the attorney general not review it (the
Board of Immigration Appeals' decision) and just allow us our day in
court to press our political asylum claim that the board said we
should have,'' Somerstein said in a telephone interview.
   ``We've felt all along that it was improper for the attorney
general to be reviewing decisions of his own board of immigration
appeals,'' he said. ``It's tantamount to his being a judge in his
own case.''
   Thornburgh's decision means ``just more delay,'' he said. ``The
delay already has been interminable, and he's been incarcerated all
through this. The length of his incarceration exceeds all bounds of
fairness, of reasonableness.''
   Doherty's case has involved the attentions of the White House,
the Justice Department, civil rights activities and the leaders of
Great Britain and Ireland.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher raised the case in talks
with President Reagan during a 1986 visit to Washington.
   Doherty's supporters include New York's Roman Catholic Archbishop
Cardinal John O'Connor, Amnesty International, the American Civil
Liberties Union and Jesse Jackson, who visited Doherty last July.
   In the latest twist in the case, which has wended its way through
federal courts and immigration hearings over the past five years,
Thornburgh ordered that the INS submit by March 27 a brief in
support of its position.
   After that, Doherty will have 30 days to submit a brief arguing
his case, and then the INS will have 14 days to file a reply.
   In 1983, the British government filed a formal request for
Doherty's extradition. It was denied in December 1984 by U.S.
District Judge John E. Sprizzo in Brooklyn, who ruled that Doherty's
crime was a political act and qualified the defendant for political
asylum.
   The government appealed and U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight
decided in Doherty's favor. A government appeal to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in New York upheld Doherty's previous victories.
   Then the Justice Department began deportation proceedings.
   Since the law says deportees can choose where they are sent,
Doherty chose the independent Republic of Ireland and his decision
was upheld in 1986 by immigration Judge Howard I. Cohen in 1986.
   Then the INS appealed Cohen's order and lost again. The
government appealed twice more, and lost twice again, the most
recent loss coming last Nov. 14.
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III, meanwhile, ``issued an
opinion that it was not in the interest of the United States'
foreign policy that he be allowed to go to Ireland, that he should
be deported to Britain,'' Miller said.
   The option of being deported to Ireland was eliminated for good
when Ireland, under pressure from London and Washington, in December
1987 ratified the European Convention on Terrorism, which calls for
mandatory extradition of those deemed terrorists.
   ``Doherty at that point asked the Board of Immigration Appeals to
revoke his concession that he was deportable, claiming grounds of
changed circumstances and the likelihood he would be subject to
persecution,'' Miller said. ``That's gounds for asking for asylum.''
   When the BIA ruled 3-2 last November, ``The three said that they
thought there was a well-founded possibility that his fear of
persecution was valid and should be considered again,'' Miller said.

<TEXT>
   Troops of an elite army
battalion attacked a rebel field hospital, killing 10 wounded
guerrillas and medical workers, the Roman Catholic Church's Legal
Aid office said Thursday.
   It said two of the female victims _ a Mexican doctor and a
14-year-old nurse _ were raped or molested before being killed in
the Feb. 13 attack.
   The office, a highly respected human rights organization in El
Salvador, sent church representatives and forensic specialists to
exhume the bodies of the two women.
   The doctor's body bore 10 bullet wounds and the nurse's body six,
and both bodies were severely bruised on the inner thighs and
breasts, according to the Legal Aid office report.
   Radio Vencermos, the guerrillas' clandestine station, reported on
Feb. 15 that troops of the Atlacatl Battalion attacked and destroyed
the field hospital two days earlier. It said six people _ three
medical workers and three wounded guerrillas _ were killed.
   The army denied the guerrilla radio charge when it was contacted
last week by The Associated Press.
   Both the Legal Aid office and the rebel radio said that among the
victims were Alejandra Bravo Betancourt, a 35-year-old Mexican
physician, and Rosibel Dubon, a 14-year-old paramedical worker.
Their bodies were exhumed and examined last Friday by the Legal Aid
office.
   The alleged massacre took place outside the village of Los
Encuentros near the Sumpul River that forms El Salvador's northern
border with Honduras. The northern province of Chalatenango, where
Los Encuentros is located, is a stronghold of leftist rebels waging
a 9-year-old civil war against the U.S.-backed government.
   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, military commander of Chalatenango, told
journalists Thursday there was no field hospital near Los
Encuentros. But he said Atlacatl troopers killed several guerrillas,
including the Mexican doctor, in combat Feb. 13.
   ``They were treating one wounded subversive,'' said Lopez Roque.
``But it was not a field hospital. There wasn't even a hut there.'
   Legal Aid said extensive interviews with residents of the area
indicated that in addition to the doctor and nurse, five wounded
guerrillas and three paramedics were killed in the Atlacatl attack.
Those bodies were buried in various remote spots in the rugged
mountainous terrain and were not exhumed, said the report.
   The church office concluded that a field hospital was in fact
installed near Los Encuentros. It said Atlacatl troops ``attacked
and destroyed the field hospital and killed war wounded and the
medical personnel present.''
   ``Because the bodies of the two (exhumed) women were completely
nude and both were bruised around the breasts and on the inside of
the thighs, rape or attempted rape is presumed,'' the report said
   The church office called the attack ``a flagrant violation'' of
the Salvadoran Constitution and of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, to
which El Salvador is a signatory.
   The alleged massacre took place 10 days after a visit to El
Salvador by Vice-President Dan Quayle. Quayle delivered what he
called a very emphatic message to the effect that Washington
expected the Salvadoran armed forces to improve their record on
respect for human rights.

<TEXT>
   The government Friday pardoned 30,000 people
convicted of minor criminal offenses and restored civil rights to
more than 11 million in commemoration of Emperor Hirohito's funeral.
   The government this month announced plans to grant the amnesty,
which it has issued in the past to commemorate historical events.
   The latest amnesties were issued in 1972 when the island of
Okinawa was returned to Japan after 37 years of occupation by the
United States.
   Government officials said about 10,000 of the 30,000 people
pardoned Friday were violators of the Alien Registraton Law.
   All but three people pardoned Friday had completed their jail
sentences, officials said. The amnesty will free this majority from
criminal records.
   The pardons also allow an additional 11 million people to recover
such civil rights as the right to vote and run for public office,
which they had lost as a punishment for their offenses.
   Past amnesty plans included a much greater number of people. A
contoversial bribery and stock profiteering scandal facing
politicians, including members of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's
cabinet, forced the government not to include violators of bribery
laws from those subject to the amnesty.

   The Rev. Timothy Healy, president of Georgetown
University, was named president of the New York Public Library on
Thursday.
   Healy, a native New Yorker who has served as an administrator at
Fordham University and the City University of New York, will replace
Vartan Gregorian, who is leaving the post to become president of
Brown University.
   Healy, 65, will take the post sometime this summer, said library
spokeswoman Lauren Moye. The library's board of trustees elected
Healy during a special meeting Thursday morning, she said.
   Gregorian became president of the library in 1981 after serving
as provost of the University of Pennsylvania. He was credited with
improving the library's finances through a number of innovative
fund-raising techniques, including parties that attracted members of
high society.
   Healy became president of Georgetown in 1976 and oversaw vast
changes at the Washington, D.C., school. In his 13 years, its
endowment rose from $38 million to $225 million.
   Each year, 1.3 million people visit the New York Public Library's
four research and 81 branch libraries. It has an annual operating
budget of $128 million and a staff of 2,274.
   Healy, who started his teaching career at Fordham Prep School,
was director of alumni relations at Fordham University from 1955-62;
executive vice president of Fordham University from 1965-69; and
vice chancellor for academic affairs at CUNY from 1969-76.
   In 1974, he took a leave from CUNY to become special assistant to
the chancellor of the State University of New York for planning the
State Prison College.
   Healy attended Regis High School in Manhattan, then received a
bachelor's degree in English and master's degree in philosophy from
Woodstock College in Maryland. He was ordained as a Jesuit priest at
the Facultes Saint Albert in Louvain, Belgium, in 1953.
   He earned a master's degree in English literature from Fordham,
and in 1965, his doctorate from Oxford University.

<HEAD>Workers Exposed To AIDS To Receive Antiviral Drug, Officials Announce</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Institutes of Health workers who are
accidently exposed to the AIDS virus will immediately be started on
doses of zidovudine, the only drug now approved for treatment of the
viral disease.
   In a notice posted late Thursday to NIH employees, an AIDS
advisory group announced that NIH director James B. Wyngaarden had
approved the emergency use of zidovudine, also known as AZT, for
research and clinical workers exposed to the AIDS virus in
laboratory or hospital settings.
   The AIDS virus, known as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is
being studied at a number of laboratories at the NIH, and there also
are patients treated at the NIH clinics. Elaborate laboratory
procedures are in effect to contain and control the virus, but there
have been a number of health care workers exposed through needle
sticks or other accidents. At least one medical worker in the U.S.
has developed AIDS after such an accident.
   ``Although definitive evidence for the efficacy of AZT
prophylaxis (preventative) in HIV exposures has yet to be
established, the advisory group concluded that the available data
suggest possible value in this setting,'' the announcement said.
   AZT, the announcement said, will be provided ``where it is judged
that the individual may have sustained a significant exposure.''
   HIV can be transmitted through an exchange of body fluids. The
disease usually is spread through sexual contact, the sharing of
needles among drug addicts, from birthing mother to child, or from
the medical transfusion of blood or blood products.
   But experts say that health care workers can also be at risk if
spilled blood, body fluids or laboratory specimens are absorbed
through small cuts or abrasions, or from the accidental stick of a
syringe needle, a fairly common accident in hospitals.
   The announcement said that the NIH advisory group on AIDS
recommended that medical workers experiencing an exposure accident
should start AZT medication ``as soon as possible, preferably within
hours following the exposure.''
   AZT, once called azidothymidine, is marketed by the Burroughs
Wellcome Co. under the brand name Retrovir. It was approved for the
treatement of AIDS in 1987 after studies showed that the drug could
suppress the HIV infection in many patients. Though the drug can
control progress of AIDS in many cases, it is not considered a cure
for the disease.
   Recent studies have also suggested that the drug is able to
prevent persons exposed to the HIV virus becoming infected if the
drug is started shortly after exposure. These studies have not been
completed.
   The AIDS virus attacks and eventually kills vital
disease-fighting cells in the blood. This leaves the body
defenseless to attack by other diseases and cancers. Most AIDS
victims die from opportunistic infections, such as rare types of
pneumonia, that their body is not able to fight.
   As of Feb. 13, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 86,157 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 43,390, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the Centers for Disease Control. No one is known to
have recovered from AIDS.

   President Raif Dizdarevic
arrived Thursday in troubled Kosovo province, where thousands of
ethnic Albanian workers struck for the fourth straight day despite
government warnings.
   The official Tanjug news agency said Dizdarevic was accompanied
by Petar Gracanin, president of the Yugoslavia's Serbian republic,
which administers the province. It was an apparent attempt to head
off possible clashes between the Albanian majority and the Serbian
minority.
   Tanjug said ``hostile pamphlets written by Albanian nationalists
and separatists'' calling for ``an uprising and bloodshed by ethnic
Albanians'' have appeared in the provincial capital of Pristina and
other Kosovo towns.
   The pamphlets allegedly denounced the provincial and national
communist leadership.
   About 1,200 workers at the Trepca lead and zinc mines continued
occupying their pits and protesting alleged discrimination by
authorities in Serbia.
   About 2,000 ethnic Albanian students from the province's capital,
Pristina, protested through the night in a sports hall to show
solidarity with the miners. About 10,000 other people were involved
in protest strikes throughout the economically depressed province.
   ``We are determined to stay in the pits until we die if our
demands are not met,'' Azim Suljemani, a digger, told The Associated
Press in an interview conducted about a half mile underground.
   The miners are on all 12 levels of the mine, which was founded in
1925 by a British company. They were sitting on wooden crates in
ankle-deep mud.
   They read reporters a written statement addressed to the United
Nations Committee For Human Rights denouncing ``discrimination of
ethnic Albanians by the Serbian government.''
   Serbian leaders say the republic should have more judicial and
police control in Kosovo to protect the Serbian minority. Serbs say
they are persecuted by the ethnic Albanians, who make up about 85
percent of the province's 2 million population.
   The nine-man national presidency, meeting in an emergency session
urged the workers to immediately end their strikes and said it would
take all constitutional and legal measures to prevent the crisis
from growing.
   Among other demands, the strikers were calling for the
resignation of the province's Communist Party chief, Rahman Morina.
   At least 17 Trepca miners were hospitalized for exhaustion after
spending three days in the pits, Kosovo's information bureau said.
   Eleven ethnic Albanians were sentenced in Pristina on Thursday to
jail terms of between four months and eight years, Tanjug said.
   The were sentenced for ``illegal, hostile'' activities allegedly
carried out as members of a group which calls itself ``The
Marxists-Leninists of Kosovo,'' Tanjug said.

   President Bush will stick with embattled Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower even though a Senate committee voted
to reject his nomination, a White House spokesman said Friday.
   In advance of the Senate Armed Services Committee's 11 to 9 vote
against favorably recommending Tower's nomination to the full
Senate, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater also told reporters that
Bush has not had any discussions of dropping Tower and finding
another candidate for the Pentagon job.
   Fitzwater said that Bush had a telephone conversation Friday
morning with Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, and that
White House chief of staff John Sununu had made calls to the Hill
during the night. Tokyo is 14 hours ahead of Washington time.
   ``We have not heard anyone say he would not make a good secretary
of defense,'' Fitzwater said. ``We have not heard anyone say he is
not qualified for the job ... We hear vague talk about concern about
his personal habits and we think this debate ought to be on a
slightly higher level than that.''
   Fitzwater briefed reporters just after Bush's motorcade left for
the funeral of Emperor Hirohito, at Shinjuku Park, just a short ride
from the hotel.
   The press secretary reiterated the White House view that the
much-awaited FBI report, which was submitted last Monday,
``refutes'' allegations of excessive drinking by Tower.
   Asked pointblank whether Bush and Sununu had discussed finding
another candidate for the top Pentagon job, Fitzwater said there had
been no such talk whatsover.
   ``I can flatly say that. I do flatly say that,'' he said. ``I've
talked to the president about that several times, including just 10
minutes ago. There's no consideration of alternative candidates.
There's no alternate list _ bar none.''
   Fitzwater, however, said there had been no discussions with Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   ``We think he's been fair,'' the spokesman said. ``He's tried to
have open consideration here. He's been critical but the committee
has every right to look into these matters.''
   `` ... And we simply say that if the (committee) vote is not as
positive ... as we would like, the next step is to consider it on
the floor, and that's what we will do,'' the press secretary said.
   Asked whether Tower should offer to withdraw his name from
further consideration, he said that was not an option ``because we
think he's a good candidate and we presume the secretary wants the
best secretary of defense they can get.''
   ``We now go to the (Senate) floor,'' Fitzwater said. ``There's a
lot of time left in this process. ... the FBI report, we feel, deals
in great detail with the drinking problem and should put the matter
to rest.''
   Fitzwater said that ``you may be assured'' that the president
``has been kept abreast of this of this all the way.''
   In the ensuing days, the spokesman said, Bush will be making
``any number of contacts'' on the Tower matter, but said ``we don't
have a specific schedule of meetings or anything like that.''
   Asked if Tower had been too damaged by the confirmation process
to succeed in the Cabinet, the spokesman said, ``No, we don't
believe so. ... Believe he will come out of this a strengthened
secretary of defense.''
   Fitzwater also said that Bush does not see the Tower confirmation
battle as a sign of any refusal by congressional Democrats to seek
bipartisanship consensus on the various issues.
   ``The president believes ... the candidate deserves to have a
hearing before the full Senate,'' he said. ``Let's hear what it is
that they're basing their judgment on.''
   ``We've been lobbying through the day the nomination went up. We
believe he will be confirmed and we will certainly work toward that
end,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We don't believe this speaks to any larger question of
bipartisanship,'' he added, saying that ``I would think the members
of the Senate and House would tell you the same thing. ... This is
quite a separate matter that has to be considered in that context.''
   Fitzwater said the White House had ``been in the game since the
day the nomination went up'' and said administration officials see
the Tower situation as ``an important nomination that we will
pursue.''

<HEAD>Military Promises Opposition Presidential Elections Will Be Clean</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAFAEL CANDANEDO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military promised the opposition
Authentic Panamanian Party on Thursday that the May 7 national
elections will be clean, Authentic presidential nominee Hildebrando
Nicosia said.
   Nicosia told The Associated Press he and other members of his
party met for three hours Thursday with military officials
representing Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who as chief of the
Defense Forces is de facto ruler of Panama.
   The officials guaranteed ``there will be pure elections in
1989,'' said Nicosia, whose party identifies itself as politically
independent.
   After the meeting, the president of the military commission, Lt.
Col. Arnulfo Castrellon, told journalists ``Gen. Noriega has
consented to talk to all the political parties to exchange opinions
in the interest of the country's progress.''
   He said that if the Democratic Alliance, a coalition of the
opposition Democratic Christian, Liberal and Liberal Republican
Nationalist Movement parties, is willing to talk, ``the doors will
be open to listen to all good Panamanians.''
   The Alliance, which has Guillermo Endara, 52, as its presidential
candidate, has refused to engage in pre-electoral talks with the
military.
   Panamanians on May 7 are to elect a president; two vice
presidents; 67 legislators and 510 local representatives.
   The Defense Forces have said they will serve under whoever wins
the May presidential ballot. They make no secret, however, of their
support for presidential candidate Carlos Duque, who represents the
government-backed National Liberation Coalition.
   The coalition is made up of eight parties that span the political
spectrum.
   Noriega has been Panama's de facto leader since February 1988,
when he orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
The president had tried to fire Noriega as military leader after
Noriega was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug trafficking charges.
Noriega denied the charges.
   Washington continues to recognize Delvalle as president and
imposed economic sanctions against Panama in an effort to force
Noriega out.
   Also Thursday, Roman Catholic church sources said a Spanish
priest detained by the Defense Forces for alleged immigration
violations has been set free.
   The military arrested the Rev. Joses Majadas Gomez in a small
village on Wednesday for allegedly overstaying his visa, said Bishop
Juan Sebastian Laboa.
   Government and opposition sources told The Associated Press the
priest was allied with the opposition and that during his sermons
spoke of increased democracy and freedom in Panama. Chitre, the town
where he was arrested, and surrounding areas are opposition
strongholds.

   Former Rep. John Jenrette was found guilty
Thursday of shoplifting a pair of shoes from a suburban Washington
department store.
   ``I find overwhelmingly, without a doubt, that he is guilty on
both charges,'' declared Fairfax County, Va., Circuit Judge Donald
B. McDonough after a three and one-half hour trial.
   The former Democratic congressman from South Carolina was charged
with petty larceny and altering price tags at Marshall's discount
department store on Dec. 7.
   McDonough gave Jenrette concurrent sentences of 90 days for each
of two misdemeanor charges, with 75 days suspended. The judge also
fined him $1,000 for each charge, with $500 of each suspended. That
left Jenrette, 52, facing 15 days in prison and $1,000 in total
fines.
   Kenneth Robinson, the attorney who represented Jenrette in the
Abscam trial as well as the shoplifting case, said he plans to
appeal. In the meantime, Jenrette was freed on personal bond.
   In October, 1980, Jenrette was convicted of sharing a $50,000
bribe in the undercover Abscam investigation.
   During the trial, Heather McKeever, a security guard at the
store, described how she saw Jenrette put on a pair of store shoes
and place his own in the bottom row of the store's shoe rack.
   Jenrette declined comment after the trial.

   It has been 30 years since the Senate rejected
a president's choice for his Cabinet and 44 years since such action
was taken by a Senate committee.
   All in all, eight Cabinet nominations have been turned down by
the full Senate, according to the Senate Library.
   The most recent was President Eisenhower's nomination of Lewis B.
Strauss to be secretary of commerce, which was rejected by a 49-46
vote on Jan. 19, 1959. Strauss had been serving in the post by an
interim appointment since the previous November.
   The Senate Commerce Committee, controlled by Democrats, had
recommended Strauss' confirmation by a vote of 9-8, with three
Democrats joining six Republicans in support of him.
   Strauss had previously been chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission. Opponents said that in that position he withheld
information from Congress or gave misleading information.
   Before the Senate Armed Services Committee voted Thursday to
reject the nominiation of John Tower as secretary of defense, the
last time a Senate committee rejected a Cabinet nominee was on Jan.
26, 1945.
   The Commerce Committee then turned down President Roosevelt's
nomination of Henry A. Wallace to be secretary of commerce by a vote
of 14-5. Wallace, who had been secretary of agriculture and then
vice president, was nevertheless confirmed by the full Senate by a
vote of 56-32 on March 1.
   The first president to have a Cabinet choice rejected by the
Senate was Andrew Jackson, whose nomination of Roger B. Taney to be
secretary of the treasury was turned down on June 23, 1834. Taney,
who was already serving in the post by a recess appointment, was
later named chief justice by Jackson and confirmed for that post by
the Senate.
   President John Tyler had the worst luck of any president when it
came to his Cabinet nominations. He had four of them turned down,
one of them three times.
   The Senate rejected Tyler's nomination of Caleb Cushing to be
secretary of the treasury by three separate votes on March 3, 1843.
It also rejected his choice of James S. Green for the treasury post
on June 15, 1844, James Madison Porter for secretary of war on June
30, 1844, and David Henshaw for secretary of the Navy on Jan. 15,
1844.
   Also rejected by the Senate was President Andrew Johnson's
selection of Henry Stanberry to be attorney general in 1868.
   President Calvin Coolidge's nomination of Charles B. Warren as
attorney general was rejected twice, on March 10 and again on March
16, 1925.

   The Democratic Socialist Party, Japan's No. 3
opposition party, elected a new chairman Thursday to replace a man
who stepped down because of a stock-profiteering scandal that has
shaken the government.
   Eiichi Nagasue, 71, was elected chairman as a regular party
convention. He succeeds Saburo Tsukamoto, 61, who announced Feb. 8
he would not seek re-election as chairman.
   ``If my resignation can bring gains for the party, I decided it
is better for me to withdraw now,'' he said then.
   A party official quoted Nagasue as telling the convention he
wants to form a coalition with the nation's largest labor union,
Rengo, and bring down the Liberal Democratic Party government of
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   The union confederation claims 5.5 million members.
   On the stock scandal, Nagasue said, ``In order not to bring to
naught former chairman Tsukamoto's courageous decision (to step
down), we will try our best to find out the truth of the Recruit
affair and bring it before the people,'' the official reported on
condition of anonymity.
   He said about 1,500 party members attended the two-day annual
convention in downtown Tokyo.
   Tsukamoto's secretary bought 10,000 unlisted shares in
Recruit-Cosmos Co., a real estate subsidiary of the information
conglomerate Recruit Co., and made about $77,000 by selling them
after public trading in the shares began in 1986 and prices soared.
   Tsukamoto has denied any direct involvement in the scandal.
   Most of the politicians linked to the case were from Takeshita's
party, and three Cabinet ministers have resigned in connection with
the affair.

   Navy Capt. Alexander G. Balian, convicted
Friday of abandoning Vietnamese refugees at sea who later turned to
cannibalism to survive, is a decorated hero of the war that created
the ``boat people.''
   The career naval officer in 1966 won the Silver Star, the United
States' third highest military award for valor, for saving members
of his crew after their river patrol boat was caught in a Viet Cong
night ambush.
   His tours of duty since then have included command of the
ammunition supply ships USS Kilauea and USS Kiska, and the
amphibious assault ship USS Peleliu.
   He took command of the USS Dubuque, a 16,500-ton amphibious
transport dock ship based at Sasebo, Japan, in May 1987. The Dubuque
carried 400 Marines as a ready reaction force and also served as
mother ship for U.S. minesweepers in the Persian Gulf.
   Balian was convicted of failing to render adequate assistance to
more than 80 Vietnamese refugees when the Dubuque, en route to the
gulf, encountered the boat people in the South China Sea last June 9.
   He was acquitted of two other charges. The court-martial panel
has yet to hand down a sentence, but he could be jailed for three
months and fined two-thirds of his pay for three months.
   United Nations and Navy officials say 31 of the Vietnamese died
from the time they encountered the Dubuque to when they were rescued
by Filipino fishermen on June 27. Survivors said they ate five of
the dead, including two who were killed.
   Balian was court-martialed at Subic Bay Naval Base in the
Philippines. Balian, 48, is a somewhat gregarious man, a cigar
smoker who once described himself as a trouble-shooter specializing
in putting ships back in shape. He is married and has two daughters.
   He was born in Southgate, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb where his
family is in the grocery business.
   At the time of his 1966 heroism, he was a young lieutenant
commanding a group of Navy ``swift'' boats operating on rivers and
canals southeast of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City.
   His helmsman was killed and the other three men on board,
including Balian, were wounded when Viet Cong gunners attacked the
boat from shore with rocket-propelled grenades and automatic weapons.
   As the fragile boat sank, the survivors put the helmsman's body
on a makeshift raft and floated downstream to safety, past enemy
positions.
   As Balian recounted the episode recently, they slipped past the
Viet Cong outposts only to encounter poisonous jellyfish, the type
known as Portuguese man-of-war. The men suffered painful stings over
their entire bodies.
   Balian, awarded the Silver Star and the Purple Heart in that
episode, later did a second tour in Vietnam aboard a destroyer in
1968.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following are excerpts from newspaper editorials
Friday, the day of Emperor Hirohito's funeral.
   The liberal daily Asahi Shimbun wrote:
   ``At the time Hirohito ascended the throne six decades ago, Japan
was regarded with suspicion by the world as an emerging military
power. ... We must never forget the tragic sacrifices that many
people were forced to make, in Japan as well as abroad, along
Japan's path of change.
   ``We must not turn our eyes away from this somber history. It is
most important to renew our awareness of the responsibilities Japan
has to the world today.
   ``For today's state funeral ceremonies, the government never
really drew a clear line between the secular and the religious.
Moreover, the Japanese public at large tends to bow to orders from
above as a matter of course; a perfect case in point is the
Education Ministry's order to all public schools that they should
teach their children the importance of mourning for the late emperor.
   Another nationally circulated Japanese daily, Mainichi Shimbun,
said:
   ``Although the government has asked people to conduct a
nationwide meditation at noon, the decision of whether to express
mourning should be left up to each individual.
   ``Unlike the days of previous deified emperors ... this funeral
is the first one under the new constitution. It should be a concise
ceremony suitable for the symbolic emperor.
   ``Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's remarks that whether World
War II was a result of Japanese aggression was a matter that future
historians should determine have received severe criticism from
countries ... damaged by the Japanese.
   ``Such overseas reactions may puzzle those of the younger
generation without knowledge of war. ... But we cannot erase the
fact that Japan caused great damage among other Asian nations, which
has not healed even today.''

<TEXT>
   Newly elected Rep. David Duke got the
House committee appointments he wanted Thursday, including one that
oversees welfare legislation, and the former Ku Klux Klan leader
said he was pleased.
   Duke, who was seated Wednesday in the House amid controversy over
his residency in the New Orleans suburb of Metairie, also received a
seat on House Judiciary Committee in addition to a spot on the
Health and Welfare Committee.
   ``I'm very happy with them,'' Duke said. ``That's what I wanted
... I want health and welfare because obviously welfare reform is
one of the most important parts of my program. Judiciary, I'm
concerned about our courts and law enforcement.''
   Rep. Alphonse Jackson the chairman of the health and welfare
panel and a member of the black legislative caucus, said, ``Glad to
have him. We can keep an eye on him.''
   Duke said he planned to pursue legislation encouraging welfare
recepients to obtain job training and employment and to cut down on
the illegitimate birth rate _ two planks of his campaign platform.
   The new lawmaker said he favored a system of incentives for
``those who show responsibility'' such as preferential housing
areas, job training and education programs.
   Although Duke said the panel probably would not meet until the
regular legislative session, he said he planned to present
amendments to Gov. Buddy Roemer's tax revision proposal once it
reached the House floor.
   Earlier Thursday, Roemer said he had no plans to meet with Duke,
but added that the door to his office was open to Duke _ under
specific circumstances.
   ``If he wants to come see me in terms of his district or our
state, I'm willing,'' he said. ``But if it's in terms of his
political philosophy, not now, not ever.''
   Duke, whose platform also called for no tax increases and
opposition to affirmative action programs, said he intended to
represent his district, which is 99.6 percent white.
   ``He is the governor of our state and I have respect for him in
that position and I'm sorry that the man doesn't understand what my
philosophy is,'' Duke said. ``He's operating on what he perceives my
philosophy was 10 years ago or 15 years ago. I wish he would have a
little bit more of an open mind.''

   A series of explosions blew the roof off a
building in an explosives plant complex Thursday, rocking homes more
than a mile away and injuring at least five people, authorities said.
   Fire raced through the building at Jet Research Center Inc., a
manufacturer of explosives for oil production, triggering the
explosions around 2 p.m., said police in this community of 3,000.
   An employee, Corine Hines, said The fire began when a mixture of
chemical powders she was mixing in a jar ignited. ``It just blew up
in my face,'' Ms. Hines told WFAA-TV. ``I couldn't run because I
couldn't see.''
   Two other Jet Research buildings containing explosives were
untouched by fire and appeared to be safe several hours after the
blaze, said Johnson County Sheriff Eddy Boggs.
   Firefighters ran out of water about a half-hour after they began
battling the fire and decided to let it burn itself out.
   Police asked news helicopters to stay away, dispatcher Billye
Lane said about an hour after the blast. ``They're expecting it to
blow again,'' Lane said.
   ``The explosion shook my house,'' said Jack Hillis, who lives 1\
miles from the plant.
   Boggs said he did not know how many people were in the building,
but about 50 Jet Research employees fled the complex, witnesses said.
   Four people were taken by ambulance to Huguley Memorial Hospital
in Fort Worth, about 25 miles away. All were treated for minor
injuries, including burns and bruises, and discharged, said hospital
spokeswoman Mary Whitehead.
   Boggs said five people were injured. Ms. Whitehead said one
person at the scene declined treatment.
   John Weber, a farmer who lives three miles from the plant, felt
several explosions. ``I was just feeding the rabbits in the barn at
the time,'' Weber said. ``All of sudden the whole building just
shook.''
   Investigators from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms bureau and
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration were on the scene
late Thursday.
   Jet Research is a subsidiary of Dallas-based Halliburton Co.,
which acquired the company when it purchased Fort Worth-based
Gearhart Industries in September 1988.
   The plant is used in manufacturing ``shaped charges'' to
perforate oil wells, said Guy Marcus, a Halliburton vice president.

   Rep. Donald Lukens was indicted Thursday on
a misdemeanor charge that he had sex with a teen-age girl, but the
58-year-old congressman declared he was innocent.
   The charge stems from a meeting, secretly videotaped by a TV
station, between Lukens and the girl's mother, who contended Lukens
paid for sex with her daughter four years ago when the girl was 13
and again last November.
   The four-term conservative Republican, who is divorced, was
charged with contributing to the unruliness and delinquency of a
child. The offense carries up to six months in jail and a $1,000
fine.
   A state grand jury accused him of having sex with the girl on
Nov. 6, when she was 16, in his Columbus apartment. The girl is now
17.
   In a statement issued in Washington, Lukens said: ``I do
categorically deny that I contributed to the delinquency and
unruliness of a minor at any time, and I further categorically deny
the accuracy of the alleged facts upon which the charge was
apparently based. I am innocent of the charge brought forth today.''
   Lukens said his attorney had advised him against commenting on
the allegations. ``But I do feel an explanation is owed to my
friends and constituents in southwestern Ohio,'' he said.
   Lukens, who is from Middletown, about 30 miles north of
Cincinnati, and represents a rural district, said he was ``pleased
that the grand jury found no evidence for the basis of serious
charges.''
   The House Ethics Committee, which has jurisdiction over
allegations of wrongdoing by lawmakers, typically waits for the
outcome before taking any action in cases where members have been
charged in court.
   A criminal conviction does not automatically bar a legislator
from sitting in Congress.
   Franklin County Prosecutor Michael Miller said he had recommended
a different charge than the one returned, but he would not elaborate.
   Miller also said he recommended an additional charge against
Lukens for an alleged incident in 1985, when the girl was 13. Jurors
determined there was insufficient evidence because of conflicting
testimony from the girl, he said.
   No date for a court appearance was set for Lukens.
   Columbus TV station WSYX on Feb. 1 broadcast a videotape that
showed Lukens apparently offering a government job to Anna Coffman
after she asked why he was ``messin' around'' with her daughter. The
station videotaped the Nov. 11 meeting at a fast-food restaurant in
Columbus after Ms. Coffman contacted the station.
   Lukens told Ms. Coffman he thought her daughter was an adult,
according to the videotape. ``Well, first of all, I didn't really
know she was a teen-ager. I didn't know that, no. I do now, of
course,'' Lukens said.
   The FBI and prosecutors reviewed the tape and but said they found
no evidence of bribery.
   Ms. Coffman, interviewed by WDTN-TV of Dayton after the
indictment, said she had hoped for a more serious charge.
   ``I expected more because this is a very serious matter,'' Ms.
Coffman said. ``What kind of impression does it have on our
children, our future?''
   Mrs. Coffman's daughter said she thinks Lukens should be sent to
jail and stripped of his congressional seat.
   ``It's like a hurt right underneath my heart,'' the daughter
said. ``Donald Lukens, he ruins my life.''
   WDTN also interviewed Michelle Foster, 20, of Columbus, who said
she was Lukens' girlfriend. She said the girl's allegations are not
true.
   Lukens was first elected to Congress in 1966 and served two
terms. He lost a bid for governor in the 1970 GOP primary. He
returned to Congress in 1986 and was re-elected in November.
   After the 1970 race, he was barred from seeking office for five
years for not filing campaign reports on time. However, the law was
changed, and he was appointed to the state Senate in 1971 to fill an
unexpired term.
   In 1974, while in the state Senate, he fought allegations he
accepted $1,000 in campaign contributions from Korean businessman
Tongsun Park during his stint on Capitol Hill.
   He presented results of a voluntary lie detector test that
indicated he was not lying when he said he had not received a
contribution from Park.

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp visited a
Baltimore soup kitchen and a shelter Thursday, then came here to
continue his first-hand look at what he has called ``a national
tragedy of appalling proportions'' _ homelessness.
   In Philadelphia, Kemp visited a home for impoverished women and a
shelter for homeless men, ending the nighttime tour at a federally
subsidized apartment house for senior citizens where he was spending
the night.
   He said he came to the nation's fifth-largest city ``to talk with
folks and to listen, to learn about the problems, to see what
they've done and what I can do to be a catalyst, to make an impact,
make a difference in this problem.''
   ``It's a very human, real problem that exists and it's a national
tragedy, and (President) George Bush wants me to not only inventory
the problem but inventory some of the answers,'' he said.
   ``We want to make some changes,'' Kemp told an audience earlier
Thursday at the Viva House shelter in Baltimore, saying he came as
an advocate for their needs, not as an adversary.
   Viva House Director Brendan Walsh told Kemp that programs for the
homeless suffered during the Reagan administration. ``So much money
has gone to the military that the federal housing budget has been
cut from $31 billion to $7 billion,'' Walsh said.
   ``That's why I'm here,'' Kemp answered. ``I want to find some
answers to the problem of homelessness.''
   Kemp's Philadelphia tour began Thursday night at Women of Hope, a
permanent shelter for impoverished women. He was accompanied by
Pennsylvania's U.S. senators, Republicans John Heinz and Arlen
Specter.
   Kemp heard 16 victims of poverty complain about the lack of
affordable housing and jobs for unskilled workers.
   ``While we sit here in this room tonight, many of our sisters and
brothers are out in the freezing cold,'' said Sister Mary Scullion,
who runs the center.
   ``We expect you, as our representative, to begin to solve this
problem.''
   ``We wanted Kemp to see human faces,'' said Robert M. Hayes, an
attorney for the Coalition for the Homeless. ``Ten minutes on a
steam grate is worth 50 white papers.''
   In addition, Hayes said, the tour will help link Kemp to the
issue.
   ``I hope this touches his heart, but in any event, his political
future will be linked with his success in battling homelessness,''
Hayes said. ``We want to teach him, but we want to link him, and
he's jumping in head first.''
   Officials estimate 10,000 women, children and men are homeless in
the city.
   Kemp, who served nine terms as a conservative Republican
congressman from upstate New York, has called the plight of the
homeless ``a national tragedy of appalling proportions.''
   After his tour of various shelters, Kemp was to spend the night
at the Opportunity Towers, a federally supported apartment complex
for senior citizens in impoverished North Philadelphia.
   Henry Taylor, the building manager, said Kemp would have his own
apartment at the towers, which he described as being ``right in the
heart'' of the one of the city's low-income neighborhoods.
   The homeless issue went to the forefront in Philadelphia in
mid-December, when city workers demolished a ``cardboard city''
erected in a subway concourse by about 75 street people seeking
shelter from freezing temperatures.
   The workers returned the following night to clean out more
makeshift homes.
   Some of the homeless then left the concourse and erected
cardboard shelters outside the U.S. Courthouse, where they and
members of a Philadelphia coalition for the homeless maintained a
12-day vigil.
   In the morning, Kemp is to visit Dignity Housing, a North
Philadelphia shelter for homeless women and their children.
   Hayes, who is acting as a tour guide, called Kemp's visit ``a
non-ideological, novice's composite tour'' with as little time as
possible spent in offices with politicians.
   Kemp spent two days in Atlanta last week, visiting housing
projects, renewal programs, interim housing for the homeless, and
privately financed developments aimed at low- and moderate-income
families.

   Wednesday's City Council meeting had a bit more
punch than usual when a councilman, who later explained he was tired
of being called a coward, scuffled with a lawyer.
   A stunned Mayor Annette Strauss and other council members watched
as colleague Al Gonzalez marched into the gallery and confronted
lawyer Domingo Garcia.
   Garcia said he had come to the council to speak on a zoning issue
when Gonzalez surprised him by coming up to his seat.
   Police officers quickly separated the two after Gonzalez, a
former professional boxer, began pummeling Garcia on his chest and
shoulders, observers said.
   A Gonzalez staff member was unable to say where the councilman
could be reached for comment by The Associated Press. But earlier,
Gonzalez told a Dallas radio station he does not remember throwing
the first punch.
   Garcia said he clearly was assaulted and later was asked by
police if he desired to press charges. Garcia declined.
   Both men agreed that the incident was politically provoked.
   ``Mr. Garcia had been making some personal remarks about me,''
Gonzalez told WBAP. ``He said something about me being a coward and
something about not having the courage, or what have you.
   ``I needed to defend my honor, and certainly I needed to defend
my name.''
   Garcia criticized Gonzalez about a month ago when the council
member said he would not endorse any Hispanics for the next council
elections. The 30-year-old Garcia and other Hispanic community
leaders have said that Gonzalez, who is not running again, is not
supporting their effort to replace him with another Hispanic.

   Bobby McFerrin's feel-good song ``Don't Worry,
Be Happy'' was the choice of the music academy for song and record
of the year over Tracy Chapman's downhearted ``Fast Car'' at the
31st Grammy awards.
   McFerrin, the vocal gymnast who uses his voice and body as an
instrument, won four Grammys Wednesday night, while Miss Chapman, a
shy 25-year-old folksinger from Boston whose self-titled album dealt
with racism, poverty and desperation, won three trophies.
   ``I think it was so popular because it went to the spirit,''
McFerrin said backstage of his song. ``I think, given the mood at
the time, it was such that people wanted something uplifting and
jovial and funny. The tempo was nice.''
   Both big winners lost to George Michael for album of the year. He
won for his platinum ``Faith,'' a crossover blend of ballads, rock
and soulful pop, including the hit single ``I Want Your Sex.''

   Social workers say a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that protects them from lawsuits for failing to prevent child
abuse means more cases will be reported, but critics say it denies
children their constitutional rights.
   The court ruled Wednesday that the state of Wisconsin was not
liable for the injuries of 9-year-old Joshua DeShaney, who was left
permanently brain- damaged and physically disabled from beatings by
his father beginning in 1983.
   The boy's mother, Melody DeShaney, sued the department for
allegedly violating the boy's constitutional rights by failing to
prevent the abuse.
   The lawsuit contended social workers failed to take action
despite their suspicions the boy had been abused several times by
his father, Randy, before the child was hospitalized in March 1984.

   America's back door has a new lock and no
welcome mat, Central Americans applying for political asylum are
learning here this week.
   Fewer than 1 percent who have tried to obtain refugee status have
received it and more than 100 have been jailed under a get-tough
policy that began Tuesday to weed out ``frivolous'' applications
before the immigrants travel farther into the country.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said Wednesday
it was too early to declare a trend, but the sharp drop in
applicants, from 233 on Tuesday to 51 the next, indicated the plan
was deterring unqualified applications.
   ``We can only speculate that the word has gotten out and many of
those coming for purely economic reasons are not coming any more,''
said INS Harlingen District spokeswoman Virginia Kice.

   Writers famous and obscure rallied nationwide in support of
Salman Rushdie, with some daring Iran to kill them along with the
author of ``The Satanic Verses.'' Meanwhile, two large book chains
reversed a decision to remove the novel.
   Some of the nation's most prominent authors marched on the
Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York and read excerpts
from Rushdie's book, which has enraged Moslems and prompted Iran's
fundamentalist government to put a price on the author's head and
threaten those involved with its publication.
   Rallies or readings also were held Wednesday in Washington, Los
Angeles, Minneapolis, San Francisco and Boston.
   At the New York reading, Norman Mailer said authors should
``stand in his place'' if Rushdie is killed _ a challenge to Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to kill them all.

   President Bush's ethics commission says top
officials in all three branches of government should curtail their
outside income, stop taking speaking fees, resign from corporate
boards and disclose more of their personal finances.
   In its third meeting, the eight-member panel on Wednesday
tentatively backed some of the toughest new rules and laws it has
suggested to date. If adopted, however, the recommendations would
fall most heavily on Congress, because panel members repeatedly
opted for applying already stiffer executive branch standards to all
of government.
   The commission's final recommendations are due on Bush's desk
March 9.

   U.S. authorities raided the downtown jewelry
market and arrested at least 37 people nationwide in an effort to
smash a $1 billion cocaine money-laundering ring allegedly run by a
Syrian national.
   The surveillance investigation, which lasted for more than a
year, was the biggest of its kind undertaken by the government,
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady said in a statement released Wednesday.
   During the past two years, the illegal network processed at least
$1 billion through jewelry merchants in Los Angeles, Texas, Florida
and New York, authorities said.
   A key leader of the ring was identified as Wanis ``Joseph''
Koyomejian, 47, a Syrian national who lives in suburban Northridge.

   Ignoring Western protests over
Czechoslovakia's human rights record and the sentencing of
playwright Vaclav Havel, a court ordered two more opposition
activists to jail for up to a year.
   The Prague court late Wednesday sentenced Jana Petrova, a
22-year-old peace activist, to nine months in prison and Ota
Veverka, 32, to one year.
   The two had been convicted on charges stemming from their
attempts last month to honor student Jan Palach, who burned himself
alive to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that crushed ``Prague
Spring'' reforms.
   Petrova and Veverka were among eight activists arrested on
hooliganism charges after they tried to lay flowers Jan. 16 in
central Wenceslas Square on the 20th anniversary of Palach's death.

   If you sometimes wonder why Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan is so worried about inflation, which might
not even reach 5 percent this year, think back to the 1970s.
   That was the decade in which the nation's economic powers lost
control of inflation and then, in a belated effort to restrain it,
forced interest rates to the highest levels in most Americans'
memory.
   The 1970s were not a long time ago, but the pace of economic
activity is so swift now that those days seem buried in history, and
gone with them _ somehow forgotten _ are the financial tragedies
that destroyed ordinary people.
   The setting for the disaster was in the previous decade, that of
the 1960s, when inflation was insignificant. From 1958 through 1965
the consumer price index, measured from one December to the next,
never even reached 2 percent.
   Stability of that sort made planning easy. You saved your money
at a certain rate of interest and, low as that rate was, you could
project your financial assets far into the future. You knew where
you stood.
   In the latter half of the 1960s things began to change, in part
because the United States under President Lyndon Johnson sought to
pursue a guns and butter economy. That is, Johnson said, both an
Asian war and a Great Society were possible.
   It wasn't true, as history demonstrated. Inflation began creeping
into the economy as budget deficits appeared. By 1969 it exceeded 6
percent. It slowed a bit over the next three years, then it struck a
devastating blow.
   From 1967 to the end of 1983 the consumer price index tripled. In
the 1970s alone it doubled. Three times between 1974 and 1980 the
rise in the price index exceeded 10 percent, reaching an incredible
13.3 percent in 1979.
   At 13.3 percent, the value of a dollar is cut in half in less
than 5{ years. While that was the extreme, and lasted for only a
year, the average annual inflation rate in the 1970s exceeded 7
percent.
   At 7 percent a year, the value of savings accounts, insurance
policies, savings bonds and the like is cut in half in 10 years.
True, savings accounts and savings bonds did earn interest, but at
much less than the inflation rate.
   Many savings accounts, for example, were fixed by law at 5.25
percent.
   Those people who believed in old virtues such as saving for a
rainy day, virtues nurtured in the steady decade of the 1960s, found
themselves robbed.
   Meanwhile, those who borrowed to speculate on inflation became
rich. In spite of rising interest rates, investors borrowed heavily
and bought real assets, such as houses. Housing prices soared _
faster even than the CPI.
   So what if interest rates were high? You wrote them off on your
taxes. And you repaid the mortgage in cheaper dollars. And you also
wrote off depreciation on the house while it doubled in market value.
   All this was possible because other people had saved money in the
good old American tradition, and were robbed. It was the heist of
the century, as if a big truck had been backed up to the banks of
America.
   Some of those people, mainly older ones, never recovered. And, of
course, the inflation that robbed them, and the efforts to overcome
it, pitched them into still another disaster, the terrible recession
that followed the '70s.
   This sad tale was just one of the consequences of the great
inflation of the 1970s. While the economy is different today, the
consequences are no less _ and probably much greater.

<HEAD>Billy Tipton's Masquerade Puzzles Jazz Experts, Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN K. WILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billy Tipton kept to himself as his jazz
trio toured the West.
   He never went swimming in the motel pools. Waiting for a call
from the group's manager, he'd say, or didn't want to burn his fair
skin. He stayed in a separate room, and didn't talk much about
childhood or family life. When he did talk, he'd say he came from a
broken home and was sent to live with an aunt.
   Drummer Dick O'Neill considered Tipton to be his best friend, but
even he was shocked at what the saxophone and piano player had been
hiding.
   ``Billy Tipton was a biological female,'' pathologist George
Lindholm said after an autopsy on Tipton, who died Jan. 21 from a
bleeding ulcer.
   Interviews with family, friends, colleagues and jazz afficionados
shed little light on Tipton's early years; even her age is
uncertain. Kitty Oakes, who lived as Tipton's wife after 1960 until
they separated about 10 years ago, told a funeral home Tipton was
born Dec. 29, 1914, in Oklahoma City and was raised in Kansas City,
Mo. But no birth certificate has been found.
   What is known is that Tipton, a saxophone and piano player who
liked to write vocal arrangements, performed with the Jack
Teagarden, Russ Carlyle and Scott Cameron bands before forming the
Billy Tipton Trio in the 1950s.
   ``He gave up everything,'' Oakes, who adopted three sons with
Tipton, told The Spokesman-Review newspaper. ``There were certain
rules and regulations in those days if you were going to be a
musician.''
   But jazz experts, including several women who played in bands in
the 1930s, said that while there was discrimination, they doubted
that a talented musician would have had to pose as a man to make it
in the industry. They point to Mary Lou Williams and others who
became famous as jazz musicians and composers.
   ``When I first started, I was skipped over unless they couldn't
get anybody else,'' said pianist Norma Teagarden, sister of Jack
Teagarden. ``At that time, it was hard to break in with a band,
especially if you played saxophone.
   ``There was a lot of resistance. There were not many women in
that business anyway. You've got to be on the road so much, you
can't very well be married, unless your husband was one of the
group.''
   ``I was a piano player and didn't have any problems'' joining a
jazz band, she said. Having three brothers who were established
musicians probably helped, said Ms. Teagarden, who performs in San
Francisco two nights a week.
   Marion McPartland, a jazz pianist who hosts a National Public
Radio jazz show, said, ``It's such a strange story, I don't feel it
any part of my own career. I can't identify with somebody doing
something like that.
   ``There were many women jazz players around, in lots of bands...
I can only say that I've been fortunate in that I've never even had
the feeling of hopelessness she had to do a thing like that,''
McPartland said.
   ``The bands were mostly men and I would think in the 1930s, where
they were on the road doing one-nighters a lot, having a woman on
the bus ... had a sort of inhibiting effect on the language used,
and so on,'' said Stanley Dance, who has written eight books on jazz
musicians. ``From that point of view, a lot of males would not
welcome the woman.
   ``Still, it seems a little bit extraordinary to have done that.''
   ``It certainly was unusual to find a white woman playing piano in
jazz bands,'' said George Simon, a jazz critic. ``I don't think that
society was really well prepared for (women jazz players). Even
jazz, which was as liberal a society as you could find, there wasn't
that much integration.''
   O'Neill said the clamor over the role reversal overshadows the
fact that Tipton was a fine musician with a keen sense of humor.
Tipton's baby face and high voice prompted some cracks in
nightclubs, but the drummer said, ``I would almost fight anybody''
who said Tipton looked too feminine to be a man.
   ``I came from a small town and was a mill worker. He had feminine
features and at first, I thought he was kind of queer. But after I
went to work for him I had no reason to think that,'' O'Neill said.
``He was a straight guy and there was no hanky-panky.''
   Tipton ``was the type of person who would give you the shirt off
his back. He made gobs of money for other people and ended up with
nothing,'' he said.
   Tipton stayed for several months in a rooming house run by the
Teagardens' mother in Oklahoma City, Ms. Teagarden remembers. Tipton
was in her late teens and lived with an older woman. Even then,
Tipton dressed in men's clothing.
   ``Billy was trying to get started. She had a few jobs around
town, but I never heard her play,'' said Ms. Teagarden. Tipton told
members of her trio she had learned to play piano from Norma
Teagarden, who also doubts that Tipton played with her famous
brother Jack.
   ``A lot of people claim those kinds of things. If they did play
with my brother's band, it was usually someone drafted for one night
to replace one of the regulars who got sick,'' she said. ``There's
something very sad about it, to have to live all your life like
that, under false pretenses.''

   Even a Bigfoot believer like Paul
Freeman concedes the supermarket tabloids get carried away:
   ``HUGE BIGFOOT MONSTER TERRORIZES THE ROCKIES! It stunk like a
sewer, roared like a lion and clutched the leg of an animal in its
hand.''
   ``BIGFOOT ATTACKED US! Blood-Crazed Creature Savages Camera Crew
and Pounds 2-Ton Truck Into Junkyard Scrap.''
   Freeman smiles at the outlandish stories, which he collects in a
cardboard box. ``There are some crazy people out there,'' he says.
   Freeman himself has been called the craziest of all.
   But he knows otherwise. He says he has seen Bigfoot. Four times.
He swears it's true, and he is out to convince a doubting world that
the legendary ape-monsters, perhaps a thousand strong, really do
roam the dark woods of the Pacific Northwest.
   ``I know they are there, and I know what I see,'' Freeman says.
``Nothing has to be proven to me. But I'd like to prove it to the
public, so they'll say Freeman's not really a kook.''
   Bigfoot _ or Sasquatch, as the Indians called the beast _ is one
of the Northwest's enduring legends. More than 750 sightings of the
creatures or their oversize footprints have been reported over the
past century, mostly in the evergreen forests stretching from
Northern California to British Columbia.
   Yet no Bigfoot has ever been killed or captured.
   No carcass or bones have ever been found.
   A few purported Bigfoot photographs exist, including a picture
taken in October by Freeman's son, but they always seem to be out of
focus, too dark, or too far away. What looks like Sasquatch could be
a misshapen tree stump or someone in a monkey suit.
   Skeptics point to hoaxes, like the time a Washington man created
a whole Bigfoot family by stomping around with three whopping pairs
of feet he had carved of wood.
   But if you want to believe, talk to Paul Freeman.
   Drive with him eastward from Walla Walla, where the flatlands of
southeastern Washington rise into the Blue Mountains of the Umatilla
National Forest. Listen to Freeman's tales of safaris into the
forest's 177,000-acre wilderness area. Behold a lonely land of
wind-bared ridges and dark, forested canyons.
   Bigfoot country, Freeman says: ``You can go in there all summer
and not see anybody.''
   Not that nobody sees you.
   Freeman tells of suddenly skittish horses, of normally docile
dogs growling fiercely at the darkness. ``Your skin gets kind of
crawly and the hair stands up on your neck,'' he says. ``You know
you're being watched, but you don't know from where.''
   Freeman, 45, does not seem the type to spook easily. He is beefy,
bearded and, at 6-foot-4 and 265 pounds, approaches Sasquatch
proportions himself. He's a meat-cutter by trade; an outdoorsman and
hunter by nature.
   He says he too was a skeptic _ until June 10, 1982, when he was
working as a watershed patroller for the U.S. Forest Service and met
up with a shaggy, reddish-brown Bigfoot nearly 8 feet tall.
   ``He was 60 yards away,'' Freeman recalls. ``I watched him walk
the length of two football fields. He'd take a few steps, look back
at me, and take a few more steps. Then he went up over a hill and
disappeared.''
   When word got out, Freeman became an instant celebrity, but the
fame was spiked with ridicule. Reporters hounded him. His
supervisors doubted him. Anonymous callers said he was crazy and
threatened to take his three children away.
   Freeman quit his Forest Service job and moved away, drifting
through a series of jobs. A gnawing need for vindication, he says,
drew him back to Walla Walla in 1984.
   He has been on the spoor of Bigfoot ever since. He says he is in
the woods three days a week and figures he has sunk $50,000 into the
search, funding it by driving trucks part time and tapping profits
from the sales of a meat-cutting business and to houses.
   What can he show for his effort?
   There is a trunk filled with plaster casts of Bigfoot tracks; and
hair samples that, according to Freeman, experts cannot identify as
man or beast.
   Near the kitchen door of his rented home, a map is webbed with
lines marking where he and son Duane, 22, have tracked Sasquatches.
In the freezer sits a chunk of suspected Bigfoot scat.
   Last Oct. 5, Duane snapped three color photos that he and his
father say show a creature they spotted 35 miles east of Walla
Walla. The best one shows a black, ape-like shape in a clearing 150
yards away.
   Duane says it made a believer out of him, but the fuzzy pictures
do less for one who wasn't there. ``I was shaking a lot,'' Duane
explains.
   Freeman says that Bigfoot was on the small side: about 7 feet
tall, maybe 700 pounds. The biggest, he says, top 8 feet and leave
18-inch footprints. Uprooted trees attest to their strength, he
says, but unlike the monsters that stalk tabloid headlines, they are
gentle and shy.
   The secretive animals evade detection by sticking to dark
canyons, foraging at night, and even altering their prints to
resemble bear tracks, Freeman says.
   ``Sure, they're that smart,'' he says. ``If they didn't have a
lot of intelligence, they'd be dead by now.''
   They eat mushrooms and skunk cabbage, elk calves and salmon,
Freeman says. Come winter, they may hole up in caves, which he says
would explain their awful stench.
   Freeman has received moral support from at least one researcher
in the murky world of ``cryptozoology,'' the study of questionable
creatures.
   Grover Krantz, a Washington State University anthropology
professor and veteran Sasquatch seeker, has examined some of
Freeman's plaster casts and found them rather convincing, complete
with fingerpint-like dermal ridges.
   But another Bigfoot researcher, Canadian author Rene Dahinden,
denounces Freeman as a publicity-seeking huckster.
   Forest Service officials don't know what to think.
   ``I've spent a lot of time in the woods, and I've never seen
anything that would lead me to believe that Bigfoot exists,'' says
Wayne Long, a fire management officer and the Umatilla's de facto
Sasquatch spokesman. Then again, he adds, ``you can go out in the
woods all your life and never see a cougar, but that doesn't mean
they don't exist.''
   Freeman says he'd just like to get a good photograph, or maybe
some bones. He has heard there are caves deep in the Umatilla's
wilderness and says that might be where Sasquatches hide their dead.
   ``If I could find some bones,'' he says, ``it would pay me back
100 times over what I've spent.''
   So far, Freeman says, his Bigfoot work has paid him only $2,000,
mostly from appearing in an ice cream commercial featuring people
who do unbelievable things.

   ABC's ``Coach'' is a winner.
   The formula _ lovable bruiser of a dad, plus teen-age daughter
equals laughs _ is as old as the Gipper. But in this incarnation,
some decent writing and an especially fine cast add up to a nice
little comedy.
   Craig T. Nelson plays Hayden Fox, football coach for the
Minnesota State Screaming Eagles, a tough guy with a soft spot for
the ladies in his life _ his sportscaster girlfriend, played by
Shelley Fabares, and Kelly (Clare Carey), his teen-age daughter from
a long-ended marriage who shows up to attend college.
   Jerry Van Dyke is a hoot as assistant coach Luther Van Dam, a
perpetually befuddled sort whose mouth runs more than the team's
best halfback.
   In Tuesday's preview episode, he must ride herd on a
buffalo-sized player who has to lose 11 pounds by Saturday's game.
``Maybe we could get him some of that hippo-suction they talk
about,'' Luther suggests. Bill Fagerbakke rounds out the regulars as
big, dumb Dauber Dybinski, a career college junior.
   The show, from ``Newhart'' creator Barry Kemp, has a preview
Tuesday night, then moves to its regular time period on Wednesday
where it will be paired in later weeks with the much-less-appealing
new ``Anything But Love'' _ but more on that some other time.
   In the preview episode, written by Mark Ganzel, Kelly lets slip
that she has a date with a professor. Dad promises not to interfere.
But through the process of elimination he finds the English
professor he suspects of daring to mess with his daughter.
   ``Forty, single and published _ just the kind of guy I have no
respect for,'' he complains to Luther.
   He pays a visit to the professor, and though he brandishes the
professor's bust of Shakespeare _ Fox thinks it's ``some president''
_ he is proud of the fact that he does not resort to physical
violence. Luther later agrees helpfully: ``If you didn't hit him or
break his statue or anything, that's good.''
   Wednesday's episode, written by Kemp, is the pilot for the show.
Kelly shows up and considers living with her dad, complicating his
long singlehood.
   It's tough out there in the big leagues, but ``Coach'' deserves
to have a nice, long season.

   Elsewhere in television:
   `FATMAN' REDUX _ ``Jake &amp; The Fatman,'' the show George Bush once
suggested everybody tune to rather than watch Democratic
presidential candidates, returns to the CBS schedule on March 15
with a two-hour episode. It replaces ``The Equalizer,'' which is
going on hiatus and WILL return, no kidding. In the new incarnation,
ex-cop J.L. ``Fatman'' McCabe has retired to Hawaii (Hey! Let's move
the show to Hawaii!) where he still gets involved in crimes and
teams up with special investigator Jake Styles (Joe Penny). ...
   JUST TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP _ Charlie Gibson, who celebrated
his second anniversary as co-host of ABC's ``Good Morning America''
on Thursday, says the job is just swell _ except for the minor
problem of sleep deprivation. He figures since leaving the Capitol
beat in Washington to take over for departed co-host David Hartman,
he's lost 2,000 hours of sleep. That's 83 days, including nights. If
anyone has seen these lost hours of sleep, please send them to ABC.
Charlie will give you a nice nap as a tip. ...
   THOSE WACKY GOVERNORS _ C-SPAN will have live coverage of the
National Governors' Association annual mid-winter meeting in
Washington, D.C., starting Sunday. The meeting goes through Tuesday
morning. ...
   MOONWALKS DU JOUR _ The Arts &amp; Entertainment Network is off to a
head start in the race to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the
landing of Apollo XI on the moon, and will run NBC's coverage of the
events as they originally aired in July 1969 on the 20th anniversary
this summer. The coverage will air in three parts: ``Liftoff'' on
July 16, ``Moonwalk'' on July 20 and ``Recovery'' on July 24. A&amp;E
did the same thing on the Kennedy assassination 25th anniversary.
... The Showtime pay cable channel has acquired ``Moonwalker,''
Michael Jackson's 1988 feature-length anthology film. The
entertainer stars as himself in a series of vignettes, including the
41-minute centerpiece of the film, a battle against evil Mr. Big,
who tries to destroy the world by getting kids hooked on drugs.

<HEAD>No Pay Raise, Just A Spending Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A popular outcry against big spending greeted the
recent proposal to raise congressional salaries. It helped defeat
the pay raise. It did little to stop the big bills.
   The pay raise would have amounted to about $29 million, but
spending on the legislative branch in fiscal year 1989 will rise
$381 million, a one-year 21 percent increase, to a total of more
than $2.2 billion.
   Spending on Congress itself, that is for operation of the Senate
and House but not including legislative agencies, will reach more
than $1 billion in fiscal 1989, six times what it cost for the same
job in 1970.
   These figures, compiled by the Tax Foundation, illustrate many
points, but perhaps none more convincingly than the inability of the
public to even find, to say nothing of grabbing and gripping, the
handle of bureaucracy.
   Voters might have thought they had the handle in the pay raise
proposal. What they had, however, was just a little burr on the
slick hide of the beast. They never knew what they missed.
   They howled, for example, about a pay raise that would have
represented 1.3 percent of the cost of operating Congress and its
legislative branch agencies _ and they overlooked spending that,
over the years, amounts to billions.
   Among the bigger things, for example, is that members of Congress
will average $100,000 each for postal expenses this year, and that
the operations of Congress now cost $3.6 million per senator and
$1.3 million per representative.
   Those operations aren't solely for what happens under the Capitol
dome or for the trips back home or the fact-finding missions abroad.
That's because Congress also maintains a number of legislative
agencies.
   Among these agencies is the Congressional Budget Office, the
Botanic Garden, the General Accounting Office, the Architect of the
Capital, the Library of Congress, and the Government Printing Office.
   Each has its own complexities, and budget too. According to the
foundation, the legislative agencies will cost taxpayers more than
Congress itself, a total of nearly $1.2 billion, or 38 percent more
than in 1988.
   The foundation, self-described as a nonprofit and nonpartisan
research organization that monitors taxing and spending, provides
these other illustrations of how complex _ and perhaps unmanageable
_ things have become:
   _Congress runs on a committee system. The Senate has 20
committees and 87 subcommittees employing 770 key staff personnel.
The House has 28 committees and 160 subcommittees employing more
than 1,271 key staffers.
   _Including the joint committees, the congressional bureaucracy is
made up of more than 50 committees with more than 250 subcommittees
paying a key staff of more than 2,100 people.
   _The legislative branch now employs more than 37,500 workers.
Congress itself has 19,200 on the payroll _ 7,200 in the Senate and
12,000 in the House.
   Confronted with the impossibly of dealing with such complexity,
the public turned its rage against the otherwise minor pay increase.
They directed their anger at the visible targets, using them as
symbols of the unknown whole.
   The question now is whether members of Congress can act on the
directive to cut spending, or whether their efforts also might be
only symbolic.
   That question arises from a review of the totals.
   Overall, says the Tax Foundation, the 21 percent leap in spending
for the legislative branch is triple the percentage increase for
total federal spending in fiscal year 1989.

   Canadian animators turning the Babar stories into
a television series and feature film are well aware of the long
memories their viewers may have of the elephant king.
   ``You have generations of people who have heard of Babar,''
director Laura Shepherd said. ``You don't want to contradict that.''
   The Babar stories date back to 1931 in France, first by Jean de
Brunhoff and then his son Laurent.
   After Toronto-based Nelvana productions won the rights to produce
a Babar series, the team that would be working on the project
immersed itself in the books to find out what was so special about
the them.
   The result _ churned out at the company's headquarters in a
fashionably renovated munitions factory _ already has started
showing on the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. in a weekly, evening slot
and will start this spring on Home Box Office in the United States.
The programs can be expected in other countries as well.
   Marvelous as the books might be, the animators found more visual
strength and character in them than 30-minute plot lines for
animation.
   ``The story lines had to be significantly changed, (but) the
bottom line for us is that the spirit's still there,'' Shepherd said,
   Indeed, it's hard not to smile through much of the first shows,
possibly because of the animated characters of Babar, Celeste, the
Old Lady and all the rest or perhaps just from the lingering
goodwill of old memories.
   The company is hoping to attract parents as well as children.
   ``We had to show networks it could work for the whole family,''
said producer Michael Hirsch, one of the company's three founders.
   The solution was to concentrate on stories about Babar as a young
king. Each episode is framed with a ``bookend'' featuring the more
familiar, older Babar and his family, flashing back to problems that
he had as a boy king and how he solved them.
   In one, for example, one of Babar's sons tries to please everyone
at his birthday party by entertaining too many special guests. Babar
then recalls how he once had a date with Celeste and a gorilla
princess at the same time.
   ``We made the theme of the series growing up,'' Hirsch said. ``We
think it makes it easier for older children and adults.''
   That makes Babar significantly different from one of Nelvana's
earlier success stories since the company's start in 1972, the Care
Bears projects, which were aimed for children from 2 to 6.
   Hirsch and fellow producer Patrick Loubert, two of the company's
three founders, don't worry about the sometimes mixed reviews the
simpler projects have had. ``The Care Bears are frankly for younger
kids. They work on a young kid level,'' Loubert said.
   ``Care Bears have very high parental approval,'' Hirsch said.
``Children love it, parents love it, but reviewers have the toughest
time of it.''
   The first Babar episode drew mixed reviews in Toronto, where the
Toronto Star said Nelvana succeeded in ``a painstaking balance of
styles'' while the Globe and Mail said fans would be better advised
to stick to the books.
   The first episode includes the scene in which his mother is
killed by a hunter, recalling the tragic episode in the animated
Disney movie, ``Bambi.''
   Asked if it was difficult to include such a scene in a children's
series, Loubert replied: ``It's a classic property. I believe the
death of the mother was part of the story. ... We agonized over it,
let me tell you. There was a lot of talk.''
   The producers are hoping for a long run with the series and Babar
animated films, the first due this summer.
   The company, which among earlier animation projects handled Star
Wars characters and the Strawberry Shortcake fad, also is taking a
direct role in licensing for the first time. The producers talk
about Babar being as durable as a Disney character, so the elephant
can be expected on everything from sheets to toys.
   ``Not everything lasts,'' Loubert said. ``We would hope that this
property would last for years.''
   ``We want Babar to be a perennial,'' Hirsch said.
   Nelvana is among the more visible companies in the growing
Toronto film and TV production industry. It claims to be among the
world's top 10 animation companies.
   The arrangement with Laurent de Brunhoff was made by Clifford
Ross, who formed a company to work with classic children's stories
and then brought Babar to Nelvana.

<HEAD>Marcovicci Plays `Saint Joan' At ACT</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THOMAS MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Andrea Marcovicci recalls a moment last year
when she spotted a brief announcement that the American Conservatory
Theatre would include George Bernard Shaw's ``Saint Joan'' in its
upcoming season.
   Marcovicci, who was in town then to perform her cabaret act at
the Plush Room, turned to her accompanist and mused: ``I wonder
who's going to play St. Joan?''
   The surprise answer came when director Michael Smuin asked her to
take on the title role, which is sometimes described as the female
equivalent of Hamlet. It's won that reputation for three very good
reasons. First, everybody who comes to see the play has their own
vision of what Joan of Arc was like. Second, the Shavian concept of
Joan is quite unlike most others.
   Third, almost every major actress of the 20th century has tried
on Joan's sandals. The leading women of stage have included Uta
Hagen, Siobhan McKenna, Sarah Miles, Joan Plowright, Wendy Hiller,
Jane Alexander, Lee Grant and Lynn Redgrave. Ingrid Bergman, Hedy
Lamar, Jean Seberg and Julie Harris have played Joan in screen
adaptations.
   Being with such heavy talent is enough to cause any actor to lose
sleep, and Marcovicci has indeed had trouble sleeping lately. A
month ago she was worried about learning her lines. Now she finds
herself tossing in bed as she mentally walks through her part.
   But she no longer worries whether she'll measure up to the great
performers of the past.
   ``If you were to worry about that, how could you ever get up? If
I were to think that way when I was singing, it would be impossible
for me to sing a song because Ella Fitzgerald did it so much better.
Judy Garland did `The Man That Got Away' better than I'm ever going
to do it, so why should I ever try?
   ``From what I've been reading, I'll never touch Siobhan McKenna
in their minds. But then you have to throw that out, and you have to
say once you take on the part, you become (Joan) and she becomes
you. Since she was a real person, if you open yourself to the echoes
of what she really said, you should be able to take her on without
too much intimidation.''
   Marcovicci has retraced Shaw's footsteps in researching the part.
She has even read the transcript of Joan's nine-week trial, which
has shown her that Shaw was correct when he told his admirers he was
merely quoting the saint.
   ``That transcript is staggering when you read it. That great line
_ when they say, `Can you possibly tell me that you are in a state
of grace?' and she says, `If I am not, may God bring me to it. If I
am, may God keep me in it.' _ That's exactly, word-for-word, from
the transcript.''
   Marcovicci also wants to show another side of St. Joan.
   ``I have to dare to let her be actually unpleasant at times,
which will be surprising to people who think, `Well, she's a saint
and we're supposed to love her at all times.' But she was irritating
beyond belief to the people that were around her,'' she said.
   ``She allowed medals to be cast in her honor. When she came into
town, she had the bells ringing a half-hour at a stretch so she
could hear them. She became quite puffed up. ... That's the thing
that's so tragic. This really has Shakespearean scope because she
doesn't see what she's doing.''
   But Marcovicci, who played Ophelia opposite Sam Waterston's
Hamlet at the New York Shakespeare Festival, doesn't see the
comparison of Joan to the Bard's prince.
   ``Hamlet is much more difficult because Hamlet is neurotic,'' she
said. ``Joan never doubted. She firmly believed in everything she
did because it came from God. And she had what none of us have _
complete assurance.''
   Although Marcovicci's acting career has included roles in such
short-lived musicals as ``Ambassador,'' ``Chaplin'' and
``Nefertiti,'' and work in television and film, she is best known to
many as a torch singer. And that strikes her as funny.
   ``It's weird. I've only been best known as a singer in the last
two years. I mean people are coming up to me at my concert
appearances and saying, `I heard a rumor you were once an actress.'''
   After finishing the run of ``Saint Joan'' at ACT, which opened
Feb. 28, and will close April 7, she hopes to return to singing. But
Marcovicci also intends to keep the public aware she's more than
just another pretty soprano.
   ``I've always wanted to go back to doing Shakespeare,'' she said.
``I'd like to work again with Joseph Papp. And I feel that this has
opened that door again.''

   Call it toothy gold, a get-rich quick plan for
an area devastated by the crash of the oil market.
   Across Louisiana's marshes, once flush with profits from black
gold, small patches of land increasingly are being turned into
alligator farms, with investors hoping to quintuple their
investments in short order.
   ``Year before last, there were just under 9,000 farm-raised
gators sold'' by 37 farms, said Dave Taylor, alligator research
coordinator for Louisiana's Department of Wildlife and Fisheries.
``That number is going to reach 60,000 quickly and could be up to
100,000, certainly, within five years.''
   That's in addition to the 24,000 wild alligators trapped each
fall in carefully supervised hunts.
   Spurred by prices of $37 a linear foot for hides, 21 new farms
have opened in the past two years, and ``We expect them to produce
18,000 gators,'' Taylor said. The waiting list for permits for new
farms is about 100.
   Jerry Jones Jr., 28, went into business two years ago near
Sweetlake and expects to put 12,000 hides a year on the market. His
farm is state-of-the-art: automated cleaning, water-source heat
pumps, carefully supervised diets.
   The result is quicker growth at less cost. ``We have some are 5-6
feet long in a year and six months. We have 8-month-old gators that
are 26-30 inches.''
   Skins of wild alligators average seven feet in length, and are
used for luggage. Farm-raised gators are skinned at two years old
and about four feet long. Their hides are used for shoes, purses,
belts and other smaller high-fashion accoutrements requiring smaller
patterns on the hides.
   For about $30,000 a potential farmer can put up a couple
windowless cinder-block buildings on concrete slabs and be ready to
raise 1,000 gators a year. It would take another $25,000 to $30,000
to operate until the gators grew enough to sell. At current prices,
1,000 four-foot hides would bring $148,000.
   ``The minimum requirements are 1 square foot per alligator up to
two feet in length and 2 square feet up to four feet in length,''
Taylor said. Buildings must be able to hold a few inches of water
and be kept about 89 degrees.
   The first thing is to gather alligator eggs from wild nests,
paying landowners for the eggs and committing 17 percent of the
hatch for return to the wild at 4 feet long. That's a carefully
researched percentage designed for zero growth in the population of
1.5 million wild alligators _ reached after the alligator was taken
off the endangered species list in the mid-1970s.
   The wild nests aren't easy to find, and female alligators guard
their eggs _ about the only time in their lives they show maternal
instincts.
   No task for the timid, Taylor agreed. ``But everybody's got to
learn some time or another, if they want to get into farming.
   ``Obviously, what would be best, for a guy's first involvement,
would be to hire someone with a little experience in locating nests
from the air. That's the only way to go: rent a helicopter and go
find them and pick them up.''
   The success of farming ventures will almost certainly drive
prices down, and there are risks any time a market depends on
fashion or something volatile, he said. ``I don't think the bottom
will fall out of the price. I don't think they'll go to $2 a foot.
But it certainly could go to half of what it is now.''
   Jones, a former trapper, commercial diver and underwater welder
who now devotes full time to his farm, agrees with Taylor's
analysis. ``A lot of these farms, you'll see what happens. Prices
are good right now, but with all these hides coming on the market,
it's going to have to go down.''
   But Jones believes he will survive when others fail because his
expenses are low. ``Look at it this way, you've got an electricity
bill of $500 a month to raise 1,000 alligators, and my bill is $150
a month to raise 12,000.''
   His major problem is finding enough nutria _ small water rodents
_ to feed the gators. Nutria often are dyed like beaver, and Jones
said, ``The price of skins is so low, right now, that you can't get
all you want. Last year I got 40,000 pounds, and I could have used
140,000.''
   He had to supplement with fish and horse, and young alligators
don't grow as quickly on that diet. In addition, too much fish gives
alligators gout.

<HEAD>China Was Home And Refuge To Many Jews Now Planning Reunion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although it's little known, China has included
Jewish inhabitants going far back to the Middle Ages. It later was
home for thousands of them who fled Nazism in Europe.
   Most of them now live elsewhere, but they plan a reunion this
spring in that land where some have roots for generations and where
others were given refuge.
   At the time of Hitler's rise when most countries had rejected
them, ``China opened its door to the refugees,'' says Yosef Tekoah.
``It was easier to find shelter there than elsewhere.''
   Tekoah, born and raised in China, is now chancellor of Ben Gurion
University of the Negev in Israel and that country's former United
Nations ambassador. He added in an interview:
   ``Many people in the West don't realize the greatness of Chinese
culture, its inherent tolerance and humanity. Basically, there was
no discrimination of the kind which Jewish people have suffered over
the years in many countries.''
   As honorary chairman of an International Assembly of Jews in
China, to be held in Shanghai April 18-30, time of the Jewish
Passover, Tekoah said it will be a ``significant event,'' renewing
old Chinese ties.
   It also will recall ``a part of Jewish history, an interesting
and fascinating period in a great and fascinating country,'' he
said. ``People are coming from all over the world.''
   The affair has implicit, though unofficial, approval of the
Chinese government, planners say, reflecting the thaw in
Chinese-Israeli relations toward trade and other exchanges.
   The earliest accounts of China Jews go back before the journey of
Italian explorer Marco Polo into China in the l3th century, the Jews
apparently having gone there from ancient Israel or other parts of
the Middle East.
   But traces of those olden China Jews generally have disappeared.
   ``Over the years, that community was completely assimilated and
absorbed into Chinese civilization,'' Tekoah said. However, ``here
and there, Chinese people still claim they are descendents of that
community.''
   He said remnants of it were reported in the central-northern part
of China at Kaifeng-Fu near the end of the 19th century when
Christian missionaries first arrived in China.
   ``There had been very little contact with China from the outside,
and the Jewish community became isolated, which is one reason it was
completely absorbed,'' he said.
   However, he said that at the same time, about the end of the 19th
century, Jewish families in India and Iraq, then both under British
rule, migrated to China, including the Kadouri, Hardoon and Sasoon
families.
   They mostly settled in Shanghai, while in the early 20th century,
Jews of European origin arrived, especially Russians fleeing the
Communist revolution, and settling mainly in China's Manchurian
north in Harbin.
   Later they moved southward to Mukden, Tientsin and Shanghai,
which developed the largest Jewish community in China. A big influx
from the Nazi threat in Germany, Poland and Austria swelled
Shanghai's Jewish population to 20,000 by 1938-39.
   Tekoah's forbears had left Russia in the 1920's after the
Communist revolution and lived in Harbin, China, where Tekoah was
born, until 1937,when the family moved south to Shanghai.
   ``Most Jewish people who have lived in China remember life there
fondly,'' he said. ``China has one of the oldest civilizations in
the world, a very fascinating country.
   ``Jewish life there was quite developed with an advanced communal
life. Organizationally there were synagogues, schools, elderly
citizen homes, newspapers and so forth.''
   However, their residence there generally ended about 1948-49 as
the nationalist government collapsed and the Communist forces took
over, causing a general exodus of all Westerners, including Jews.
   ``Some Jewish people, a very few, remained into the 50's, but
they, too, soon left,'' Tekoah said. His own family had left in
1945, after which he completed undergraduate studies in the U.S.,
before going on to Israel.
   Shanghai buildings that had once housed Jewish institutions have
been converted to other purposes, and signs of Jewish life there
removed.
   However, at the coming reunion there after 40 years of absence,
planners said that with the blessings of Chinese authorities,
plaques are to be erected on sites cherished in Jewish memory.
   ``For most of us,'' Tekoah said, ``returning to Shanghai will be
a tangible restatement of our faith in Jewish survivial and our
friendship toward China.''

   Speakers at a conference on spirituality and
social action say the two go together, one growing out of the other.
   Most of the seven presenters told the conference, sponsored by
the United Church of Christ social-concerns agency, that they grew
up in a deeply evangelical faith, which now motivates their
involvement in social causes.
   The Rev. Felix Carrion, pastor of Spanish Evangelical Church in
Lawrence, Mass., called his religious outlook a ``calluses'' faith
because he ``knelt ever day for an hour in prayer.''
   ``My God was personal,'' he said, but he found that personal
piety alone wasn't adequate to confront the world. He said, ``if we
really believe in the Lord's prayer that `thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven,' we must have more than a personal faith in
God'' and work to make life better for the weak and hurting.

<TEXT>
   More than a century after Arab slave
traders and gold and ivory merchants built their lavish homes, shops
and bazaars near Zanzibar's flourishing harbor, the labyrinthine old
quarter is crumbling.
   Now, the government is trying to restore the district known as
Stone Town to at least a semblance of its former glory through a
process very similar to the gentrification of rundown neighborhoods
in England and the United States.
   Stone Town never ceased to be a commercial focal point for the
Spice Island. Its elaborately carved, brass-studded wooden doors and
the lattice-work balconies hanging over narrow alleys embody
Zanzibar's intertwined Arab, Asian and African heritage.
   During 20 years of social and economic upheaval, Stone Town was
neglected and suffered severe deterioration. But with new money
created by the government's 5-year-old policy of economic
liberalization and $400,000 in technical assistance from the United
Nations, Zanzibar hopes to reverse the decay.
   The effort is led by Ahmed Sheikh Ahmed, director of the Stone
Town Conservation and Development Authority, which has put most of
its resources not into renovating the buildings but selling them.
   ``The idea of selling the buildings is not to get money, the idea
is to get people to look after the buildings,'' said Ahmed.
   After a revolution by Zanzibar's black majority in 1964, many of
their abandoned buildings were confiscated by the socialist
government, which converted them into multi-family dwellings for
low-income families and newly arrived rural peasants.
   Many of the dilapidated structures now pose a potential danger to
tenants and shoppers in the quarter's busy alleys, said Ahmed.
During heavy rains in 1984, seven buildings collapsed, killing five
people, he said.
   Stone Town is home to an estimated 18,000 people.
   It is Zanzibar's historic seat of government and still houses
most of the island's official offices, 40 percent of the city's
classrooms, the majority of its mosques, temples and churches, as
well as banks, movie houses, hotels, restaurants and the island's
main market.
   It contains the remains of a stone fort built by Omani Arabs in
the 1700s, a palace built by the island's Arab rulers in the
mid-19th century, the home of Tippu Tub, a notorious slave trader,
and other historically or architecturally valuable buildings.
   Since 1985, the development authority has overseen the sale of
120 buildings and Ahmed credited the sales to the nation's economic
liberalization policies that opened doors to free enterprise.
   ``Before 1984, most shops were closed. After 1984, most shops
opened. Now they can do business, make money and repair buildings,''
Ahmed said.

<HEAD>Integra Keeps Comming up in 10 Best Lists</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The most frustrating part of driving a 1989 Acura Integra is the
other cars on the road. Many don't have anywhere near the
performance and handling features of the Integra and seem, well, to
get in the way.
   It's not that the Integra purposely wants to show off. It's just
built to be a serious traveler.
   Introduced in late 1986, the car was named in January 1987 one of
Car and Driver magazine's 10 best. It also was runner-up to its own
kin, the more expensive Acura Legend Coupe, in the competition for
Motor Trend's Import Car of the Year.
   In January 1988, the Integra bowed again on Car and Driver's 10
best list. And in the annual Car Book released last December,
1986-88 Integras had the honor of showing no owner complaints of
trouble in federal government files.
   Not bad for a car that starts at $11,260 but offers the
performance of some higher-priced autos. (Car and Driver once wrote
that the Integra's sticker price brings tears to the eyes of General
Motors executives.)
   It also brings out relatively well-heeled buyers, many of whom
were previous or current Honda buyers. Integra sales in calendar
1988 totaled more than 54,000, up from more than 50,000 in calendar
1987.
   Median household income of Integra five-door buyers is $54,000,
said company spokesman Mike Spencer. Seventy-percent are men, 89
percent have college education, the median age is 39, and 78 percent
are married.
   It's positioned as a family sports sedan, Spencer said, noting
the Integra -- made by Honda but sold in separate Acura dealerships
-- competes against the sporty Honda Prelude and widely popular
Honda Accord.
   But the Integra leans more heavily toward the sports side than
the family side, Spencer admitted, saying, The company has pushed
the performance image and the ties to Formula One racing with the
car. Some engineered items, such as the Integra's sophisticated
electronic engine management systems, stem from that racing
experience, the company says.
   In contrast, the Accord appears a more sedate type of family
vehicle, although its 2-liter, 12-valve, four-cylinder engine is no
slouch. It compares with the Integra's 1.6-liter, 16-valve, twin
overhead cam four cylinder and the Prelude's 2-liter, 16-valve
powerplant.
   There are subtle differences among the cars, Spencer explained,
noting the Prelude is positioned more as a sheer sports car, with
less interior room for passengers and cargo than the Integra has.
   Pricewise, the Integra is amid its Honda cousins. The Accord
starts at around $11,000 and the Prelude begins at around $14,000.
   The test car, an Integra LS five-door, squealed its tires a few
times until I got accustomed to the 118 horsepower under the hood.
The Integra sure tried to grab the road, even in slick conditions.
   The ride was all sport, no cushiony, floating feeling here. But
it also made for good road handling and feel.
   Seats were nicely contoured to fit the body well and not quite as
fitted and low to the floor as those in the Prelude, making entry
and exit easier.
   The ride, combined with the smooth engine-five-speed manual
transmission performance and low road noise, made for pleasurable
traveling up front.
   In the back seat, legroom could be at a premium if the front
seats were pushed back all the way. Rear legroom was OK if the front
seats were pushed up a ways. It also could be a close fit for three
adults in the back seat.
   In comparison, the Accord is a couple inches wider.
   Like nearly all family cars now, the Integra's back doors had
child-proof locks, and the rear power windows could be deactivated
by a switch on the driver door.
   The hatchback area was roomy, and the rear seats could fold down
for more room. There was a shelf behind the rear seat where items
could be placed. It doubled as a partial cover for things stowed
below in the hatchback and folded upward for access below.
   I found I had to be sure to keep the rear lap belts out of the
way when putting the rear seats back up or the belts could get stuck
against the car body.
   The Integra's fit and finish, inside and out, was impeccable. I
noted that while the Integra had power windows and door locks, the
outside mirrors had to be adjusted manually as did the radio antenna.
   Consumer Reports magazine ranked the 1986-87 Integras much better
than average according to its survey of owner trouble reports.

<HEAD>GOP Purge Try Makes David Duke Best-known Legislator</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's nothing like a political exorcism to
make a name for a fringe candidate. All of a sudden, David Duke is
the best-known state legislator around.
   Right now, more people probably know the name of the state
representative from Metarie, La., than know who represents them in
their own legislature.
   Duke, 38, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, came to
national note because as soon as the Republican Party found out
about him, GOP leaders _ up to and including President Bush and
former President Reagan _ tried to purge him.
   Actually, the Republicans were in a no-win situation when Duke
barged onto the ballot in Metarie, a suburb of New Orleans. They
couldn't be silent without appearing to accept him. But by speaking
out against him, they provided Duke the very platform he sought.
   Thus a 227-vote margin in the 81st assembly district of Louisiana
provided what Duke couldn't get as a minor party candidate for
president. He was on the ballot in 15 states as a Populist Party
candidate, in a campaign managed by a former leader of the American
Nazi Party.
   Duke got a total of 48,267 votes for president _ 18,612 of them
in Louisiana, or 1.1 percent of the total vote there.
   Then Duke, who had started as a Democrat, changed his
registration to Republican and ran for the legislature. On Jan. 21,
he led a seven-candidate field with 33 percent of the vote in an
open primary, a system unique to Louisiana. All candidates,
regardless of party, run against each other in the primary and the
two top finishers meet in a runoff.
   In this case, both finalists were Republicans _ Duke and John
Treen, a homebuilder and the brother of a former governor. Duke got
8,459 votes; Treen 8,232.
   Duke's primary lead sounded an alarm to state and national GOP
leaders, who went to work for Treen and arranged the Bush and Reagan
endorsements. That raised the stakes, and his election to the
legislature _ he took his seat on Wednesday _ became a national GOP
embarrassment.
   It was heightened because of the bitter and often negative 1988
presidential campaign in which the Bush organization was accused of
racist tactics for its TV commercials about the crimes of a
furloughed black convict.
   Furthermore, Republican Southern strategies in presidential
campaigns dating back to 1964 concentrated on the conservative white
voters who broke up what once was a solidly Democratic South.
   Lee Atwater, the Southerner who managed the Bush campaign and now
is Republican national chairman, says the GOP is reaching out to
black and other minority voters, seeking to broaden its base among
groups that have been overwhelmingly Democratic.
   Duke quit the Klan in 1980 in a leadership dispute, and set up
his own organization, the National Association for the Advancement
of White People. Atwater said Duke is no Republican but ``a
pretender, a charlatan and a political opportunist.'' He said he
wanted Duke ``disenfranchised from our party.'' But excommunication
implies that the sinner was in the church in the first place, so
party leaders decided to censure Duke instead, declaring that he is
not a Republican ``in gesture, deed or belief.''
   Even that adds to the notoriety level for Duke. Atwater said he
was going to stop talking about the unwanted GOP legislator because
a prolonged argument ``plays right into his hands.''
   Bush acknowledged that some people in Metarie may have thought it
was improper or overkill for the president to pick a candidate in a
special election to the state legislature. ``I just felt I had to
speak out,'' he said. ``But whether it helped or hurt, I don't
know.''
   History says that sometimes a challenge to the dictates of a
national party can pay dividends at home. In 1965, House Democrats
stripped Rep. John Bell Williams of Mississippi of his seniority as
punishment for his endorsement of Republican Barry Goldwater for
president in 1964. It didn't hurt in Mississippi; two years later he
was elected governor.

   Step into Golden West Financial Corp.'s Oakland,
Calif., executive headquarters and you won't find a smiling
receptionist to greet you, nor will you be invited to sample the
culinary concoctions of a company chef.
   These, along with automatic teller machines, are considered
luxuries that the large savings and loan company says it will
forsake for now.
   Staying lean, and sticking to the traditional business of safe
single-family home loans, has helped make Golden West a huge success
story in an industry marred by fraud, incompetence and high-flying
lending deals.
   About a quarter of the 3,200 federally insured S&amp;Ls are
considered insolvent or close to it, with most concentrated in the
oil and farm belts.
   These thrifts account for most of the industrywide losses, and
the government is grappling for solutions that will likely require
more than $100 billion in aid.
   The crisis has incited widespread speculation that S&amp;Ls will
inevitably die like dinosaurs. Nevertheless, many have made it to
the top or rebounded from hard times and intend to stay there.
   ``The guys who got in trouble got away from tradition,'' said
James H. Grohl, a senior vice president for the industry trade group
U.S. League of Savings Institutions. ``If you stuck to your housing
knitting, chances are you'd be in much better shape.''
   A study by the giant trade organization last fall found that
thrifts considered successful had twice as many assets, on average
65 percent, in traditional housing related investments such as
mortgages or mortgage-backed securities, as unhealthy institutions.
The problem thrifts had three times as many assets, 40 percent vs.
12.7 percent, in non-traditional areas such as commercial loans or
risky ``junk bond'' securities, the report found.
   Golden West, with $14 billion in assets, is probably the best
example of a thrift that has prospered by staying on the straight
and narrow. It makes no loans except for housing, and 80 percent of
them are for single-family units.
   As a result, bad loans represent 0.4 percent of its loan
portfolio, compared with 2 percent for the industry on average.
   Husband-and-wife team Herbert and Marion Sandler have placed a
tight rein on costs since taking the thrift's helm in 1963 and
steadily expanding it to 200 branches in six states, partly through
carefully planned acquisitions.
   Instead of footing the bill for a receptionist, Golden West asks
visitors to announce themselves through a black telephone in a small
reception area at its 17th floor executive suite. The Sandlers also
have gone without the comforts of a private diningroom or a chef,
preferring to munch deskside on fruit and cottage cheese.
   Customers also don't have access to ATMs because the Sandlers,
who control a 20 percent stake in the company, don't think it makes
sense financially, although Sandler says the wiring is in place if
they decide to take the plunge.
   Sandler said his thrifty thrift is not a penny pincher. ``We're
just planning to grow prudently,'' he said.
   Golden West also has an aggressive training program geared to
improving customer service and a covert team of ``shoppers'' who
rank employee performance at bank branches, he noted.
   Equally as lean and mean only on a smaller scale is Washigton
Federal Savings and Loan Association in Seattle, which has $2
billion in assets and is widely thought to be one of the strongest
and best managed thrifts in the country. Less than 10 percent of its
loan portfolio is in commercial real estate.
   More telling is Washington Fed's 11 percent ratio of equity to
assets, among the highest in the nation and four times the minimum
amount required by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
regulations. The company believes the strong net worth position
will, among other things, protect earnings against interest rate
risk.
   Talman Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, a Chicago thrift
with $6.3 billion in assets, and TCF Financial Banking and Savings
of Minneapolis, with $5.2 billion in assets, learned the hard way
that venturing too far from their roots is risky.
   Talman started out with the traditional focus of mortgage
lending. But Chairman Theodore H. Roberts said its problems began
after acquiring four troubled S&amp;Ls at the urging of federal
regulators, which were heavily involved in commercial real estate.
   The company has since gotten back on its feet with the help of
about $200 million in federal assistance.
   Roberts said all problem assets have since been disposed of,
along with about 20 unprofitable branches, and the thrift has become
``plain vanilla'' again.
   ``The secret of success is just to go back to basics and do what
the thrift charter intended us to do, which is to take in personal
savings and intermediate those savings into single family home
loans,'' Roberts said.
   TCF, formerly known as Twin City Federal Savings &amp; Loan
Association, got into trouble after setting up a big-time lending
operation, National Properties Inc., in New York more than five
years ago. It had planned to make money by funneling the savings of
thrifty Minnesotans into Eastern real estate ventures, but wound up
with about $100 million in loan losses.
   ``We made most of the classic mistakes that were made in the
industry,'' said William Cooper, TCF chairman and chief executive
officer.
   Three years ago, a new management team led by Cooper began
reshuffling TCF's loan portfolio and closing unprofitable branches.
TCF revived its nearly dormant mortgage lending operation and found
a comfortable niche in consumer finance.
   ``We capitalized off our roots and diversified but into the kinds
of things that S&amp;Ls tend to do well, which is retail banking,''
Cooper said.
   Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., thrift consultant, said thrifts
often do well in finding the proper niche. ``They've got to be
somewhat like the gourmet delicatessen, so to speak, or the shop
that sells clothing for tall men.''
   Columbia Savings &amp; Loan of Beverly Hills, Calif., had found a
comfortable, and very profitable, niche in junk bonds, with the
high-yield, high-risk securities making up about a quarter of its
$11 billion in assets.
   While the volatile junk market is not considered a traditional
safe haven for thrifts, Columbia beat the odds through good
management, analysts said.
   ``The key is they've brought sufficient expertise aboard,'' said
Henry S. Peltz, a thrift analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods, a New
York securities firm. ``They have their own underwriting, investment
department. They don't take anybody else's word for it.''

<HEAD>Last Year's Drought Still a Vivid Memory for Many Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Given normal precipitation as winter fades
away, farmers will take to the fields this spring hoping for bumper
crops, good prices and smiles at the bank just in case of hail or a
summer dry spell.
   Just about everywhere, though, lurks the memory of last year's
heat and drought that caused billions of dollars in losses to crops
and livestock.
   ``Many farmers who had successfully survived the farm financial
turbulence of the mid-1980s faced a new challenge (in 1988) as their
crops withered in the fields,'' says an Agriculture Department
report. ``Some farmers were fortunate enough to have large crop
inventories from the previous season and could sell them at
drought-induced higher prices.''
   Others made extensive use of irrigation and harvested good crops
at substantially higher prices.
   But there were others who had no stored grain, no irrigation and
not much chance of convincing lenders that the 1988 drought was just
a glitch and that times were bound to get better in 1989 or 1990.
   The staff report by the department's Economic Research Service
estimated that without drought relief, some 20,000 to 30,000 of the
nation's 550,000 commercial farmers _ those with annual sales of
$40,000 or more _ suffered losses that put their long-term survival
at risk.
   As it was, Congress passed the $3.9 billion Disaster Assistance
Act to help hard-hit farmers. That law and its relief programs will
``likely reduce the core problem group'' by half and leave 10,000 to
20,000 shaky farms, the report said.
   Most of the farms hurt most by drought losses are in the northern
Great Plains, Corn Belt and Great Lakes areas.
   Higher prices for the big grain inventories kept the cash income
of farmers nationally at a near-record level in 1988, despite
drought and lower yields.
   ``Cash income in 1989 is expected to fall somewhat because
farmers likely will replenish inventories, will receive fewer
government payuments because of higher commodity prices, and,
consistent with increased planting, will incur somewhat larger
expenses,'' the report said.
   ``Nonetheless,'' it added, ``the farm sector will be in a
stronger financial position in 1989 and possibly 1990 because the
drought lowered burdensome stockpiles, especially corn, while
strengthening commodity prices.''
   The drought of 1988 was a major event for agriculture, with crop
and livestock losses at around $13 billion in dollars of 1982 buying
power. Those losses amounted to only about 0.3 percent of the
nation's real Gross National Product, or the total value of all
goods and services produced last year, the report said.
   In specific areas, however, the effects of the 1988 drought were
much more disheartening.
   The report included findings on five severely hit areas of
Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Illinois and Ohio. Here are
descriptions of these areas and capsule summaries of the drought
impacts.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MONTANA</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An eight-county area in the northeast, including large-scale
wheat farms and cattle ranches. The average farm is more than 3,500
acres, compared with the U.S. average of 440 acres.
   The direct farm loss from the drought was estimated at $152.5
million, most of it from reduced wheat production. An estimated
federal drought assistance payment of $68 million reduced the loss
to around $85 million.
   The drought's impact on the overall economy ``could be
substantial'' as well, with a potential drop in total business
activity of nearly 10 percent, even after federal aid.
   The counties covered were Daniels, Dawson, Garfield, McCone,
Roosevelt, Richland, Sheridan and Valley.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>NORTH DAKOTA</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A five-county area in the north-central part of the state. It is
also the most farm-dependent area of those examined. Farm production
accounted for 32 percent of percent of all jobs in 1985 and
agribusiness accounted for another 3 percent. The farms produce
mainly wheat and barley.
   Sales in the livestock sector are mostly beef cattle but include
some swine and dairy cattle.
   Drought losses to agriculture were estimated at $114.6 million,
with federal assistance offsetting about $35 million of the total
losses.
   The counties covered were Benson, Bottineau, McHenry, Pierce and
Rolette.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>WISCONSIN</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A seven-county area in the southwest involves mostly medium-sized
dairy farms. Twenty-six percent of all employment is in farm
production, with another 5 percent in agribusiness. More than half
of all farm sales are dairy products.
   Direct loss to farmers was estimated at $134.2 million, largely
because of higher feed costs. Federal drought aid was estimated at
$29.4 million.
   The counties covered were Crawford, Grant, Iowa, Lafayette,
Richland, Sauk and Vernon.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>ILLINOIS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven counties in east-central Illinois, representing ``one of
the most productive farming areas in the United States,'' deep in
the heart of the Corn Belt. The farm sector is dominated by medium
and large farms that produce corn and soybeans.
   But while farming is important, the area's economic base is ``not
very dependent'' on agriculture. Most local jobs are in industry or
government, with farm production accounting for about 7 percent and
agribusiness about 5 percent.
   Drought losses to farmers were estimated at $326 million, of
which $108 million was offset by federal payments.
   The counties covered were Champaign, Ford, Iroquois, Livingston,
Kankakee, Piatt and Vermillion.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OHIO</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven counties in the northwest, dominated by manufacturing and
other non-farm economic activities. Farming accounts for only 4
percent of total employment, with agribusiness adding 3 percent.
Corn and soybeans account for more than half of total farm sales.
   Corn and soybean losses were estimated to be 40 percent and 25
percent, respectively. Total direct losses from drought were
estimated at $164.8 million, with drought payments offsetting about
$31 million.
   The counties include Allen, Defiance, Fulton, Henry, Lucas,
Hancock, Paulding, Putnam, Van Wert, Williams and Wood.

   Consumer prices shot up 0.6 percent last month,
their fastest rise in two years, the government said in a report
that analysts cited as fresh evidence of entrenched and accelerating
inflation.
   Propelled by higher costs for food, energy and a variety of other
goods and services, the seasonally adjusted increase in the Consumer
Price Index doubled the moderate 0.3 percent gains of November and
December, the Labor Department said Wednesday.
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, meanwhile, stepped up
his warnings about higher inflation, pointedly noting the disturbing
increase in consumer prices and raising the prospects of a recession.

   Members of the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday attacked
provisions to raise S&amp;Ls' capital requirements, finance the
government portion of the bailout off the federal budget _ at an
extra cost of $4.6 billion to taxpayers _ and give the Treasury
Department greater control over the institutions.
   Meanwhile, in their rush to catch up to thrift industry fraud and
mismanagement, federal regulators may have unknowingly hired some of
the culprits responsible for the savings and loan debacle, The

way for up to 20 Boeing 767s.
   The sale announced Wednesday of 747-400s to All Nippon Airways

meet delivery deadlines for the sophisticated jumbo jets to other
airlines.
   The order, added to six 747-400s ordered by All Nippon in

Japan Air Lines ordered 20 of the same model in July 1987. British

   A continued drought this year would push crop

and magnify loan losses for farm lenders, a government economist
warned.

bleak outlook for agriculture if dry weather again plagues the

   But some newspaper executives who are negotiating with Sears say
they believe the talks will produce agreements beneficial to both
sides.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Westminster Bancorp Inc., a subsidiary
of a British banking concern, has agreed to acquire the First
National Bank of Central Jersey in a cash deal valued at around $282
million.
   The $50-a-share bid disclosed Wednesday is subject to approval
from regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, and the
shareholders of Ultra Bancorporation, First National's parent
company.
   Ultra Bancorporation, based in Bridgewater, N.J., operates 35
branches and had assets of $1.25 billion at the end of 1988.
   Under the agreement, First National will operate as a subsidiary
of National Westminster and become the second New Jersey bank to
merge with the company in the past year. In February 1988, National
Westminster bought First Jersey National Corp.
   National Westminster, with assets of around $20 billion, is a
wholly owned subsidiary of London-based National Westminster PLC.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Jump, Greenspan Restates Warning on Interest Rates,
Recession</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Will be led with Commerce Department report on January durable
goods, scheduled for 8:30 a.m. EST</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report of a jump in inflation and a warning from the
Federal Reserve about higher interest rates unnerved the stock and
bond markets.
   The Labor Department reported Wednesday that consumer prices
jumped 0.6 percent in January, the fastest rise in two years and
twice the 0.3 percent increases of November and December.
   The government said prices rose not only in the volatile food and
energy categories, but also for a variety of other goods and
services.
   The latest increase translates to an annual inflation rate of 7.2
percent. In 1987 and 1988, inflation grew at a moderate 4.4. percent
pace.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan pointed to the consumer price surge
and restated an earlier warning that if price pressures are not
brought under control, inflation will advance and intensify a
recession.
   The Fed has been trying to keep the economy from overheating by a
series of credit-tightening moves that have pushed short-term
interest rates up about 3 percentage points since last March.
   Even in advance of Wednesday's report, worries about inflation
were intensified by evidence that the economy entered 1989 with
strong momentum and by a sharp 1 percent jump in wholesale prices
during January.
   Economists predicted the Fed would respond to the latest consumer
price figures by swiftly driving interest rates even higher.
   Greenspan, who testified for a second day before Congress,
indicated the credit tightening would continue until the Fed was
satisfied the economy had slowed enough to lessen inflationary
pressures.
   On Wall Street, the inflation numbers and Greenspan's remarks
gave the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks its worst day in
three months. The index skidded 42.50 to 2,283.93, while declining
stocks outnumbered gainers by 4-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   The credit markets also responded negatively to the news. The
Treasury's closely-watched 30-year bond fell about $6.25 for every
$1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite
direction from its price, jumped to 9.12 percent from late Tuesday's
9.05 percent.
   Gold and silver futures advanced modestly in reaction to the
consumer price report.
   President Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, said
Wednesday the administration believed inflation developments needed
to be monitored closely with swift action taken if it appears that
inflation is accelerating.
   ``We will not tolerate a rise in inflation,'' Boskin said in an
appearance before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress.
   Boskin stressed that it would be wrong to read too much into one
month's inflation figure.
   In another report Wednesday, the government said it posted a $2.8
billion surplus in January due to a surge in revenue caused by
quarterly tax payments from individuals.
   The Treasury said government revenue totaled $89.4 billion last
month, up 9.3 percent from the same period a year earlier. Spending,
meanwhile, was up 31.4 percent from January 1988 to $86.6 billion.

<HEAD>Boston Hotel Union Contract Could Spark Change In Federal Labor Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Workers at Boston's hotels are eager to improve
their living conditions through a unique union contract provision,
but their use of the union's new housing fund is on hold because it
apparently violates federal law.
   Business and labor leaders alike hailed the affordable housing
trust fund adopted in December by Boston's hotel management and the
AFL-CIO's local hotel and restaurant workers union as part of the
workers' contract.
   Labor advocates say substandard housing conditions are as
unacceptable as inadequate health care and that union aid is long
overdue, especially in expensive housing markets such as Boston's.
   The plan also has been touted as a potential boon for
hard-to-staff businesses based in pricey resort areas like
Massachusetts' Martha's Vineyard or Aspen, Colo.
   But the ground-breaking fund has sparked concern that it violates
federal labor law.
   Lawmakers in Washington are considering whether to legalize the
housing fund under the labor restrictions contained in the
Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947.
   The legislation, known as the Taft-Hartley Act, was initiated
chiefly to prevent union kickbacks by specifying exactly what kinds
of joint union-management funds may be established.
   ``The law has to catch up to the times,'' said Bruce Marx, the
local union's housing director. ``We have to pick up the slack for
the reduction in the federal government's involvement in housing,
and yet the law makes it illegal for unions and management to
cooperate.''
   Boston union leaders last year proposed the fund to help workers
afford the city's housing. The leaders envisioned building housing
with the fund, or subsidizing mortgages, down payments and rental
deposits.
   In a recent survey, 98 percent of the city's hotel workers
reported they could not afford to buy a medium-priced home, while 78
percent said the couldn't rent an average apartment, Marx said.
   Recent figures show the median cost of a home in Boston is about
$177,200 while the average hotel worker's annual salary is $16,000.
   Resolved to bridge the housing affordability gap, labor leaders
negotiated up to a December strike deadline before securing the
unprecedented housing fund.
   The three-year agreement requires hotels to funnel $1 million
into the housing trust, which will be combined with $12 million in
union pension funds earmarked for upgrading workers' accommodations.
   Hotel managers initially were reluctant to adopt the fund but
reconsidered when it became apparent that housing was a top priority
for most of the 3,000 union workers, said Peter Van Kleek, president
and chief executive officer for Saunders Hotel Co. Inc., which
operates three large Boston hotels.
   ``Our reaction in the final analysis was that we want to respond
to those issues which the workers feel are important,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Van Kleek predicted the fund could run into trouble
on Capitol Hill.
   ``There have been any number of efforts over the years to reopen
Taft-Hartley and there is, I'm sure, a whole shopping list of items
people would like to see included,'' he said. ``I suspect there
might be some controversy.''
   But Richard Ferlauto, a director at the American Affordable
Housing Institute, said housing has become a critical concern
nationwide. The housing fund is thus likely to gain bipartisan
support in Congress, where lawmakers are expected to set the labor
policy agenda in coming weeks, he said.
   ``We happen to think that housing benefits will be the new
collective bargaining benefit of the 1990s, much like day care was
the cutting edge issue in the 1980s,'' said Ferlauto, whose New
Brunswick, N.J.-based institute is affiliated with Rutgers
University.
   Labor activists are pushing for an amendment to current federal
law before June 1990, at which time the money being set aside for
housing will revert to the union's health and welfare fund if no
such legislation has been passed.

<HEAD>Unisys Lays Off 1,700 Workers As Part Of Major Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES WEBB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp., which last week promised to
trim its work force by 3 percent in 1989, has effectively met its
goal by laying off 1,700 employees at 60 U.S. locations in a major
restructuring.
   In addition to the U.S. layoffs, the company said Wednesday from
its headquarters in suburban Blue Bell that it will close a
component assembly plant in Nogales, Mexico, at a cost of 400 jobs.
   ``Obviously this is a major restructuring ... that has brought us
essentially into the range where we told people we wanted to be for
1989,'' said J. Peter Hynes, a Unisys spokesman.
   The move comes on the heels of last week's announcement by Unisys
Chairman W. Michael Blumenthal that the computer giant planned to
reduce its work force of 93,000 by 3 percent this year, or about
2,800 people, and cut more than $500 million from its inventories by
mid-year.
   About 190 employees at the company's headquarters were laid off
Wednesday, and about 400 more will lose their jobs at the end of
July, when the company consolidates a computer-design group at the
headquarters with a larger division in Roseville, Minn., Unisys said.
   The action this week was just the latest move in Unisys' employee
cutbacks.
   Since Burroughs Corp.'s $4.8 billion takeover of Sperry created
Unisys in 1986, the company has pared 18,000 from its payroll
through sales of operations and 12,000 more through early
retirements and layoffs, not counting the layoffs announced
Wednesday.
   Hynes said only ``a small number'' of the affected employees
would be transferred or rehired.
   Hynes said all employees released this week will receive six
weeks' pay in addition to a severance package. All also are eligible
for job counseling, he said.
   Hynes said earlier that about 900 of Unisys' 68,000 U.S.
employees have been offered early retirement so far this year.
   On Tuesday, Unisys introduced a long-awaited line of mainframe
computers designed by the engineering group in Blue Bell. The new
2200 series will replace the company's 1100 line. The product's
release was delayed by several months, hurting sales as customers
postponed purchases until the new line was available.
   Blumenthal acknowledged last week that it had been ``a tougher
year'' than anticipated and that he expected a weakness in sales to
continue in the first half of 1989.
   Sales in 1988 increased 2 percent from 1987, to $9.9 billion.
Although Unisys' profits rose about 18 percent in 1988, most of the
increase was attributable to lower tax rates, not bigger profit
margins. The company's operating profits slumped by nearly
one-quarter in the final quarter of 1988.
   At a recent meeting with Wall Street analysts, senior executives
said they expected results from the first three months of 1989 to be
``poor,'' with no revenue growth, largely because of the bottoming
of the 1100 product cycle.
   The second quarter will improve as the new computer line starts
kicking in revenue, while the third and fourth quarters will be
``exceptional,'' they said.

   The Federal Reserve Board says it has directed
its examiners to closely scrutinize banks' involvement in leveraged
buyouts, warning they ``have the potential to raise the level of
risk in bank loan portfolios.''
   The Fed, which regulates bank holding companies, including the
nation's largest banking firms, said Wednesday that lending in
leveraged buyouts, or LBOs, ``is not considered inappropriate so
long as it is conducted in a sound and prudent manner.''
   However, it cautioned that banking organizations' involvement in
LBOs, which have mushroomed over the last year, could have
``significant implications for the quality of their asset portfolios
and their overall levels of risk exposure.''
   In an LBO, an investment group borrows heavily in order to take
over a company or a division of a company. Often LBOs are proposed
by managers seeking to thwart a hostile takeover. The company's new
owners either cut costs or sell off pieces of the company to pay
back loans.
   The danger, according to the Federal Reserve memorandum, is that
the high debt levels ``can place heavy demands on a borrower's cash
flow and reduce the borrower's ability to absorb the effects of
unanticipated financial shocks or economic adversity.''
   The board said examiners should review a bank's overall exposure
to risk by involvement in LBO lending as well as the soundness of
individual LBO loans.
   ``Any significant portfolio risks need to be identified and
brought to the attention of senior management and the directors,''
it said.
   The Fed also warned that banks which participate by lending money
in LBOs arranged by other firms should independently evaluate the
deals before advancing any money.
   The board's memorandum to examiners, released Wednesday, was
dated Feb. 16. It supersedes LBO guidelines issued in June 1984. The
new instructions also apply to other so-called highly leveraged
transactions, including stock buybacks financed by high levels of
debt.
   The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the
Treasury Department that regulates nationally-chartered banks,
issued similar instructions to its regulators in December.
   Meanwhile, a half dozen congressional committees are examining
ways to curb the buyout boom, but have been unable to agree on an
approach that wouldn't cut tax revenues or have other unintended ill
effects.

   Like foxes guarding the chicken coop, some culprits in the
savings and loan industry collapse may have been hired by the
federal government to oversee billions of dollars in assets of
failed thrifts, The Associated Press has learned.
   Two officials of failed thrifts who became regulators are now
targets of criminal investigations, and a federal prosecutor says
he's thinks there will be more.
   Most of the people hired to handle the billions of dollars' worth
of property and loans seized from failed thrifts are honest,
officials said. Yet they expect to find more bad apples.
   ``I would not be surprised to see one or two instances of that
emerging as the (Justice Department's bank fraud) task force
proceeds,'' said U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of Dallas.
   A longtime savings industry official agreed. ``I would imagine
there would be one or two others when you hire 800 people. Maybe 80
or 50 or 30 people _ some percentage that drops over the line,'' the
official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``It will
take a long time before it all gets out.''
   Collins said fraud may be continuing in the thrifts themselves.
``Some people feel they can take advantage because the system is
currently overloaded by investigations,'' said Collins, who's been
working on S&amp;L fraud since the mid-1980s. ``We'll be very attentive
to them.''
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board hired as many as 800 people _ a
``high percentage'' of them from failed S&amp;Ls _ without performing
background checks, government and industry officials said.
   When employees of failed thrifts are hired as regulators,
``that's a risk, sure,'' acknowledged bank board spokesman Bill
Fulwider.
   Still, he added, ``The assumption is it's generally not their
fault the institution went down. They understand the assets, and
they have expertise that's valuable.''
   Two cases illustrate the pitfalls.
   Philip S. Noons was hired by the Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance
Corp. in April 1986 after Mainland Savings, a Houston high-flier
suspected of widespread fraud, was declared insolvent. Noons had
been a project manager at Mainland, and he went to FSLIC managing
Mainland assets.
   On Feb. 8, the FBI arrested Noons and his 31-year-old twin
brother, Thomas, and charged them with conspiring to embezzle money
from the FSLIC by grossly undervaluing Mainland loans acquired by
the FSLIC and then selling them to two Houston companies on behalf
of themselves.
   One package of 16 loans was valued by Philip Noons at $1,500,
prosecutors said, while the FSLIC said the package is actually worth
$1.6 million. In another case, the brothers paid $692,821 for a loan
worth $4 million, the FBI said.
   The Noonses' attorney, David Berg, says that his clients are
innocent and that the government has overreacted and overstated the
amounts involved because of pressure for S&amp;L action following
President Bush's new plan. Neither brother was implicated in any
wrongdoing while at Mainland, Berg said.
   Regulators have also drawn fire for the hiring of Stuart Jones, a
former real estate loan officer for Richardson Savings &amp; Loan
Association.
   Jones was hired in October as deputy director of the bank board
in charge of disposing of the agency's massive real estate
portfolio, despite criminal referrals to the FBI about his conduct
at Richardson, officials said.
   In December, when officials in Washington learned about the
request for an FBI probe made by Dallas regulators, Jones was
transferred to a post that does not handle selling assets, Fulwider
said. The investigation continues, he said.
   Despite those two cases and suspicions of others, regulators say
they do not believe they have a significant problem.
   ``Until these two instances surfaced, for all the rapid buildup
it seems to have worked pretty well,'' Fulwider said. ``Out of
several hundred people who have been added throughout the bank board
staff we don't seem to have encountered any real problems in terms
of numbers.''
   But the bank board may not be aware of the full extent of the
problem. According to Collins, when the Justice Department task
force uncovers evidence against an S&amp;L official now working for
regulators, it can't tip off the agency because of confidentiality
laws.
   A private attorney specializing in bank fraud told the AP of a
case he encountered where a former S&amp;L official was hired by the
government to handle repossessed properties even though he has a
financial interest in some of the properties _ a probable
conflict-of-interest violation.
   ``As many people as they had and as many problems as they had, I
wouldn't believe that's the only problem,'' said the attorney, a
former white-collar crime prosecutor who asked not to be named
because the incident involved a confidential attorney-client
relationship.
   As the S&amp;L industry was deregulated and high-flying thrifts took
off into speculative and sometimes fraudulent endeavors, federal
regulators found their agencies grossly understaffed and unable to
keep up.
   By the mid-1980s, a hiring push was approved, and the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board found itself needing not only examiners but
also real-estate and banking experts who could help handle the giant
portfolios the government was seizing.
   The people with experience and available for hire were the ones
who had worked at the failed thrifts.
   Until August 1986, they were hired under Schedule B, a government
program that waives background checks to speed up the process,
Fulwider said. After that, the bank board contracted with an agency
to check new hires for criminal records. Checks have never been done
retroactively.
   The bank board made 6,000 criminal referrals to the FBI from
insolvent thrifts, asking the bureau to look into specific
transactions and individuals.
   The collapse of the S&amp;L industry is expected to cost some $100
billion to resolve. A large portion of that cost, officials have
said, results from mismanagement and outright fraud by S&amp;L
executives.

   The stock market lost more ground today in a
carryover of selling from Wednesday's sharp drop.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped .18 to 2,283.75
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in the early tally of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 267 up, 691 down and 510
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.69 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the markets were still struggling to recover from
the jolt of the report Wednesday that the consumer price index
jumped 0.6 percent in January.
   The news sent bond prices lower and stepped up expectations that
the Federal Reserve might feel compelled to tighten credit further
and faster than it had previously planned.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, described the report as
``disturbing.''
   With all that, however, brokers said blue chips began to recover
today, benefiting from buying by money managers who had been looking
for a pullback in prices to move some of their large cash reserves
into stocks.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines dropped ]
to 123; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph was unchanged at 30{, and
General Electric rose [ to 45}.
   Japanese issues were strong after the Tokyo market set a new
high. Honda Motor rose 2~ to 159 and Matsushita gained 2| to 188.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .13 to 163.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .62 at 321.45.
   On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.50 points
to 2,283.93, for its biggest decline in three months.
   Declining issues outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 in
nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 332 up, 1,197 down
and 446 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 163.14 million
shares, up from 141.95 million in the previous session.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan
said today the Fed will make it easier for bank holding companies to
buy troubled savings and loans, and he suggested that a specialized
thrift industry may not be needed in the future.
   Greenspan, in testimony submitted to the Senate Banking
Committee, also said the Fed has made arrangements to support the
Federal Home Loan Bank system in the event of runs on S&amp;Ls.
   The committee was holding its second day of hearings on President
Bush's plan to rescue the ailing industry by selling $50 billion in
bonds to raise the money to close insolvent institutions.
   Some analysts have said the president's plan won't provide enough
money, but Greenspan said that ``in our judgment, all things
considered, the $50 billion should be adequate'' to take care of 470
insolvent S&amp;Ls.
   Investment from outside the thrift industry, from banks and other
firms, likely will be needed in order for the thrift industry to
meet the new capital standards that the administration is proposing,
analysts have said. Greenspan said ``more than a majority of
thrifts'' that are not insolvent will be able to meet the new
capital requirements.
   The central bank chairman also said he ``attaches considerable
importance'' to a proposed Treasury Department study of the deposit
insurance system. He said the study should help ``ensure a smooth
transition to modified insurance arrangements.''
   Part of the study should include whether it is ``unnecessary to
provide special government subsidized facilities for mortgage
lending,'' Greenspan said. In the future, it may be ``possible to
bring all the depository institutions under one regulatory and
supervisory system,'' he suggested.
   He told the committee ``it is vitally important for Congress to
move very promptly to consider and enact the president's proposals.''
   Congressional leaders say an attempt by Bush to keep the rescue
plan from inflating the short-term federal deficit will add billions
of dollars to the eventual cost.
   Bush wants to pay for part of the rescue by selling $50 billion
in ``off-budget'' bonds over the next three years through a special
government-sponsored corporation. That way, the government could
spend $50 billion that would not show up on the books as part of the
budget deficit.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.,
said Wednesday that figures compiled by his staff show the
off-budget mechanism will cost the government an additional $4.6
billion over 30 years.
   Meanwhile, James Blum, acting director of the Congressional
Budget Office, told the House Ways and Means Committee that the
administration's plan would boost the government's interest payments
by $100 million to $200 million a year.
   But Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady vigorously defended the
arrangement Wednesday before Riegle's committee, which conducted the
first congressional hearing on the 2{-week-old plan.
   Brady acknowledged that the bailout could be financed on-budget
through regular, long-term Treasury borrowing but said that would be
at a cost of ``one less Trident submarine or no day care.''
   Brady also was sharply questioned about whether the
administration is proposing a big enough rescue to put the industry
on a sound footing. He said that not only would the plan provide
money to close 350 insolvent institutions and meet the commitments
on 205 failed S&amp;Ls rescued last year, it would provide $24 billion
from 1992 through 1999 to handle the possible failures of another
150 weak institutions.
   Riegle told reporters after Wednesday's hearing that he was
keeping an open mind, but so far could find no reason to favor an
off-budget arrangement.
   ``If there are advantages, they're not obvious to me. ... I think
you start from the premise that you ought to keep the cost to a
minimum, especially when you and your folks and your neighbors are
going to have to pay for this problem, or a large part of it,'' he
said.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said in a 13-page analysis of the Bush plan that
taxpayers would save $138 billion over 30 years if Congress directly
appropriated the S&amp;L money.
   But, he conceded, that ``would require a special tax earmarked
solely for the purpose of financing the savings and loan bailout''
and ``administration policy and political reality may rule out this
more direct approach.''
   Riegle and the ranking Republican on his panel, Sen. Jake Garn,
R-Utah, said they were introducing the 333-page administration
proposal on Wednesday. Riegle said he hoped to have a bill ready for
action by the full Senate by the first week in April.
   Gonzalez, despite his reservations about parts of the
administration plan, intends to introduce it in the House.
   Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman asked
the House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday to extend tax breaks
offered to private buyers of failed S&amp;Ls and banks. They're set to
expire at the end of the year.
   Seidman said the tax breaks reduce the on-budget cost of rescues
and promised to use them ``to minimize the government's total cost.''
   However, Charles A. Bowsher, head of the General Accounting
Office, said more direct assistance to failed institutions is
cheaper. Blum also warned that the current system is attracting some
buyers who are most interested in obtaining the tax breaks than in
operating the rescued S&amp;Ls efficiently.

<HEAD>West Point-Pepperell To Announce Auction Results</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST POINT, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Textile giant West Point-Pepperell Inc.,
target of a $1.53 billion hostile takeover from rival Farley Inc.,
convened its board of directors today to decide who would acquire
the company.
   The West Point, Ga.-based company was put on the auction block
Feb. 3 as the board sought to thwart the $52-per-share offer by
Chicago-based Farley.
   The company said its board was meeting but didn't specify when an
announcement would be made.
   Farley, which owns underwear-manufacturer Fruit of the Loom Inc.
and Acme Boot Co. Inc., has informed the Securities and Exchange
Commission it has made a bid for the company separate from the
tender offer. The terms of that offer have not been disclosed.
   The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co., or its separate leveraged buyout unit Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners, had put in a bid for the company, which has about
a quarter of the nation's home fashion textile market through such
brands as Lady Pepperell, Martex and Utica.
   Other companies reportedly showing interest in Pepperell include
Dominion Textile Inc. of Montreal and Milliken &amp; Co. of Spartanburg,
S.C.
   Pepperell, founded in 1886, became the nation's largest publicly
traded textile company last year through the acquisition of most of
J.P. Stevens &amp; Co. Inc.
   It has 41,000 employees and 22,000 stockholders. The company
earned $10.8 million on revenues of $683.13 million in the last
quarter of 1988. For the fiscal year ended Sept. 24, the company had
revenue of $2.15 billion and earnings of $84.36 million.

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 42.50 points
Wednesday for its largest loss in three months, dropped 8.93 to
2,275.00 by 11 a.m. today on Wall Street.

   Analysts said the markets were still struggling to recover from
the jolt of the report Wednesday that the consumer price index

   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, described the report as
``disturbing.''
   With all that, however, brokers said blue chips attracted some

   The international securities business will be managed by Duncan

   Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as speculators
took profits after three days of rising prices.
   The early sell-off followed indications that the Soviet Union
purchased 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices
overnight. The wheat market had rallied Wednesday in anticipation of
such a purchase, and today's opening losses reflected traders'
tendency to ``buy the rumor, sell the fact.''
   Soybean and corn futures also opened slightly lower. Some
analysts said the soybean market was overbought and due for a
correction after the solid gains of the three previous sessions.
   This week's higher prices also prompted a pick-up in farmer sales
of corn and soybeans. The increased availability was reflected in
this morning's lower futures prices.
   In early trading, wheat was unchanged to 1{ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.24} a bushel; corn was \ cent
to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.72 a bushel; oats were { cent to

   Eastern Airlines pilots said they would cross
Machinist union picket lines if there's a strike next month,
provided the troubled carrier's owner grants them concessions in
their own contract.
   The statement Wednesday from Eastern's pilots union came after it
had threatened to join the machinists in a possible March 4 walkout,
and was seen as an overture to Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank
Lorenzo, who controls Eastern.
   Rick Chapman, secretary-treasurer of the master executive council
of the Eastern pilots union, said the pilots would cross machinist
picket lines ``if they (Eastern management) make it worth our
while.''
   Chapman spoke with a small group of reporters at the Harvard Club
in New York, where the pilots union organized a presentation for
financial analysts and Eastern creditors.
   The Machinists represent about 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers
and other ground personnel at Miami-based Eastern. The union has
threatened to strike over contract concessions demanded by Texas Air
to save money at the airline, which has lost hundreds of millions of
dollars over the last several years.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said today the airline's
negotiators believe progress has been made recently on reaching an
accord with the pilots on a ``fence agreement.''
   Eastern's ``fence'' proposal to the pilots, Matell said,
guarantees that the airline would keep its fleet at the current
level, guarantees all pilots against layoffs, and prevents Eastern's
international routes from being transferred to another Texas Air
subsidiary.
   The pilots, who are scheduled to meet with management on Monday,
are seeking a contract guaranteeing their job security as well as a
pledge from Lorenzo not to sell any more Eastern assets. The union
also wants management to outline a ``business plan for action'' for
Eastern and seeks the eventual merger of Eastern and Continental
Airlines, another subsidiary of Texas Air.
   But Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Eastern pilots union, said
today the union's negotiators weren't satisfied with the company's
``fence'' proposal, which they believe didn't provide sufficient
guarantees.
   Officials of the Machinists union were not available for comment
Wednesday.
   Eastern and the Machinists have been talking for 16 months. The
union will be free to strike legally March 4 if no new contract is
reached by then. A 30-day cooling-off period mandated by the
National Mediation Board expires at midnight March 3.
   A federal mediator began meeting Wednesday in Washington with
both sides in an intensified effort to reach a settlement.
   ``The pilots will go out (on strike) for pilot issues,'' said
Wright B. George, another member of the pilots union council and
chairman of the union's business committee. ``This has nothing to do
with the Machinists. If we go out, it will be for pilot issues.''
   ``That's posturing for the longer term,'' said Robert Joedicke,
an airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., referring to the
pilots' demand.
   Joedicke and other observers believe it's unlikely that the
hard-nosed Lorenzo would agree to such demands.
   The pilots and Machinists at Eastern ``have no love between
them,'' Joedicke said. ``They're singing out of the same hymn book
just because of sheer fear.''
   Pilots at major airlines have rarely supported strikes by their
fellow unions, industry observers note.
   The Eastern pilots officials said they have begun polling their
membership on the strike issue and expect to have the results by
March 2, one day before the Machinists' deadline.
   Eastern, meanwhile, is instructing supervisors to avoid verbal or
physical confrontations with striking employees in the event of
machinist walkout.
   In a 26-page ``Supervisor Survival Kit,'' a copy of which was
obtained by The Associated Press, Eastern warned supervisors not to
``permit any picketers or strikers to embroil you in shouting
matches, exchanges of hostilities, physical confrontations or the
like.''
   If there is a strike, supervisors also are told not to speak with
the press or ``any outside party'' about the airline's strike
planning or decisions.

<TEXT>
   A new Dodge sport-utility vehicle and
another Jeep vehicle will be built in early 1992 at a new Chrysler
Corp. plant in Detroit, the company said Thursday.
   The vehicle, code named the ``ZJ,'' will be the first
sport-utility vehicle marketed by Dodge dealers, the company said in
a statement. It will be the only vehicle made at Chrysler's planned
Jefferson North plant.
   The ``ZJ'' will be larger than the Jeep Cherokee, now made at a
Chrysler plant in Toledo, Ohio, the statement added. Details of the
vehicle will be available when production starts.
   The Dodge and Jeep versions would be different, but Chrysler
spokesman Doug Nicholl declined to say how.
   The $1 billion Jefferson North factory will replace Chrysler's
current Jefferson Avenue plant. Chrysler said it expects to begin
construction at the Jefferson North complex in two months and that
production would start in January 1992.
   The new plant, with two shifts operating, will have a production
capacity of about 200,000 vehicles a year by 1993, Nicholl said.
   Chrysler now makes the Plymouth Horizon and the Dodge Omni at the
Jefferson Avenue plant. A production decision involving those two
cars beyond 1992 has not been made.
   The No. 3 automaker said it is putting the new sport-utility
vehicle at the Jefferson North plant because of growing demand in
that segment of the light truck market and because the Toledo plant
was at full production levels.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Quash Trader Subpoenas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has refused to quash grand jury
subpoenas issued to three traders in the probe of commodities
trading practices, ruling that it is too soon to decide questions
about investigators' methods.
   Attorneys for the traders contend their clients should not be
forced to testify or hand over documents because evidence against
them came from tape recordings obtained improperly by FBI
investigators.
   U.S. District Judge John Grady rejected the argument in a ruling
released Wednesday. Attorneys for the traders, who are identified
only as John Doe traders 1 and 2 and Jane Doe trader 1, said they
would appeal.
   The ruling was the first public document detailing legal
maneuvers in the federal probe into suspected illegal trading
activities at the Chicago Board of Trade and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Grady said he couldn't rule on the propriety of the
tape-recordings unless he knew what questions prosecutors planned to
ask the traders during grand jury proceedings.
   ``It would be difficult to ascertain whether those questions are
based upon electronic surveillance,'' he wrote. ``And, if so,
whether they are based upon illegal as opposed to legal electronic
surveillance.''
   Grady placed a week-long stay on subpoenas requiring the three
traders to appear before the grand jury to allow them to appeal his
ruling. Attorneys for the traders said they would appeal.
   Susan Bogart, who filed the motion for the traders, said she was
pleased Grady ``recognizes the difficult and interesting question
concerning the unlawfulness of the wiretaps.''
   The Chicago Tribune reported today that mounting paperwork,
including the task of transcribing voluminous tape recordings, will
delay plans to bring charges in the case until late March.
   Citing unnamed sources, the newspaper reported that the
government was trying for early indictments to pressure suspects to
cooperate.
   The investigation, first disclosed in January, focuses on
allegations that brokers and traders cheated customers out of
millions of dollars in executing their orders to buy and sell
futures contracts for commodities ranging from soybeans to Swiss
francs.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing the
future of Public Service Company of New Hampshire proposed
auctioning off the insolvent utility, still swamped in debt from the
stalled Seabrook nuclear power plant.
   Judge James Yacos made the surprising suggestion Wednesday during
the first day of a hearing on the direction of the utility's
complex, 13-month-old bankruptcy case.
   ``I realize this is coming out of left field,'' Yacos said after
raising the auction idea with Steven Davis, president of a
bondholders group that is a major player in the reorganization, the
biggest by an investor-owned utility since the Depression.
   Yacos asked Davis, who was the first witness at the hearing,
whether it would be feasible to establish a set of terms and
conditions that all bidders would have to meet.
   Davis replied that Yacos' idea could work _ but only if there
first is agreement on what electricity rates the reorganized or
bought-out Public Service will be allowed to charge.
   ``The auction procedure you have outlined could be very valuable
and useful, provided rate levels are set beforehand,'' Davis told
the judge.
   Differences among the state, the utility and its creditors on
appropriate rates already have turned the reorganization into a
bitter and potentially lengthy ordeal.
   In testimony today, an executive of a utility hoping to buy
Public Service's non-Seabrook assets warned against being too
specific in setting terms for bids to settle the bankruptcy.
   ``I'm very concerned that if we overly structure the process,
we'll end up undervaluing the outcome,'' said Robert Busch, senior
vice president for finance of Connecticut-based Northeast Utilities.
   Busch said bids submitted without a formal structure could be
compared with one another adequately, though that wouldn't be easy.
   In debt from its 36 percent share of Seabrook and barred by state
law from charging ratepayers for the reactor before it operates
commercially, Public Service sought bankruptcy protection on Jan.
28, 1988.
   Settlement talks among New Hampshire officials, the utility and
its creditors broke off in December, and Public Service filed a
reorganization proposal on Dec. 27 under which it would seek federal
regulation and gain higher rate increases than the state is willing
to offer.
   State officials have offered rate increases totaling 22 percent
over five years, and say the rates Public Service seeks would drive
away customers and prove counterproductive. Public Service wants the
equivalent of a one-time increase of about 30 percent.
   The utility, which serves 75 percent of New Hampshire's 1 million
residents, is trying to get an extension of the ``exclusivity
period'' during which it has the exclusive right to make
restructuring proposals.
   However, state officials, creditors and Northeast Utilities _ New
England's largest power company _ oppose the extension, charging
that Public Service is stalling.
   To reach a decision, Yacos said, ``This court has to know whether
there are real negotiations going on and whether they are going
anywhere.''
   Northeast Utilities already has announced a bid for Public
Service, which says about a dozen other companies also have
expressed interest. New England Electric System of Massachusetts is
the only one to have said so far that it plans to bid too.
   Davis, president of Consolidated Utilities &amp; Communications Inc.,
was called to the witness stand by Public Service's chief bankruptcy
lawyer, Richard Levin. With banking giant Citicorp, Consolidated
owns key Public Service third-mortgage bonds.
   Davis testified for four hours on whether the judge should let
creditors and other parties start filing reorganization proposals _
buyouts or otherwise _ to compete with the proposal Public Service
filed Dec. 27.
   Since filing its restructuring plan, Public Service has said it
was continuing negotiations with Consolidated and other creditors.
But state officials refused to join the talks, saying the company
and its creditors were not being realistic in their demands.
   Davis disclosed Wednesday that talks with the company on rates
broke off during the first week of February.
   ``That particular effort is not going forward,'' Davis told
Levin. He said another meeting was held Thursday on other matters,
but he declined to elaborate, saying the participants have agreed to
confidentiality. Davis said no further talks are scheduled.

magazines, the dapper doctor's son who wore bow ties was drafted to
court the advertisers.
   ``He was an absolutely superb salesman,'' recalls Wilma Jordan, a
former Whittle colleague who now runs an investment banking firm.
Besides, she said, Whittle's flair was just what the young
publishers needed ``for calling on conservative clients.''
   At 41, Whittle still wears the bow ties. He also has sold some of
the nation's biggest advertising clients on his company, which has
expanded beyond magazines into a $150 million business recognized as
an industry innovator.
   Its 44 properties range from magazines to videos to wallboards,
which resemble miniature billboards with a mix of brief articles and
ads, hung in offices and schools.
   Whittle's latest venture is a satellite-delivered television news
show aimed at high-schoolers, which he's launching in early March.
Book publishing may lie ahead.
   He has fostered the growth by arguing that conventional print and
broadcast media aren't delivering the audiences they once did. His
creations are designed to deliver ad messages to precisely defined
audiences such as new mothers, college students, pet owners and
travel agents.
   That message has won big-name clients such as Procter &amp; Gamble
Co., Ralston-Purina Co. and Warner-Lambert Co. It also has saddled
him with a reputation as a maverick because of his unsubtle jibes at
magazines and television.
   For instance, Whittle heralded Special Reports, his glossy
package of quarterly magazines designed for pediatrician's waiting
rooms, with full-page ads featuring this headline over a photo of a
torn and smudged magazine page:
   ``Few things equal the special quality of magazines in a doctor's
waiting room.''
   Whittle promised doctor-subscribers that he would send someone by
every month to replace tattered copies. But he asked them not to
keep more than two other magazines titles in the office.
   The request enraged rival publishers, who count on waiting room
readers to bolster circulation. Some threatened lawsuits but never
filed any.
   Robert Teufel, president of Rodale Press Inc., which publishes
Children magazine, conceded that he and other publishers have cooled
off.
   ``I think our reaction was to his hype,'' he said.
   So what does he think of Whittle and his magazines now? ``I think
their products are graphically superb. Whittle is probably the best
salesman in the publishing business,'' Teufel said.
   Whittle doesn't need compliments to know what the industry thinks
of him. He's got cash instead _ $40 million for himself alone when
magazine giant Time Inc. paid $185 million last fall for half
interest in his company.
   ``He has a track record; the rest have hopes,'' said Reginald
Brack, chief executive of Time's magazine group.
   Whittle, a country doctor's son born Aug. 23, 1947 in Etowah,
Tenn., went to the University of Tennessee, where he met Phillip
Moffitt and others who would become his business partners.
   Eighteen months after his 1969 graduation, he went back to
Knoxille, bought a two-room log cabin he still calls home, and
joined ex-Tennessee classmates already working on the magazine
company.
   They called it 13-30 Corp., named after the age group they hoped
to reach. Their first magazine was Knoxville in a Nutshell, a guide
for incoming Tennessee freshmen.
   After making $2,000 the first year, they decided they could
multiply profits by publishing guides to other locales. The costs of
keeping as many as 115 magazines in operation at once nearly crushed
the company.
   Whittle said the money crunch became so severe he once asked an
advertiser: ``Would you mind if I go down to the finance department
to get the check?'' The advertiser agreed and the check paid
Whittle's office phone and electric bills.
   The company eventually consolidated its city guides into a single
national magazine for college students called Nutshell, and began
making money.
   In 1974, Whittle sold Japanese automaker Datsun on the idea of a
single-sponsor magazine, a twice-a-year travel publication aimed at
college students. The combination has lasted 15 years although the
cars now are called Nissan.
   In 1979, the company bought a controlling interest in Esquire
magazine, which Whittle said was losing $100,000 a week at the time.
It took five years to refocus the magazine, fix circulation problems
and make it break even.
   Whittle decided he was spending so much time in Manhattan that he
needed a second home. In 1980 he bought a five-room apartment in The
Dakota, a sprawling building on the west side of Central Park where
the late John Lennon had lived. Whittle's apartment is filled with
paintings he's collected in the past six years, mostly from the late
1800s and early 1900s. His Dakota neighbors include singer Roberta
Flack and actress Lauren Bacall.
   By mid-1986, the demands of Esquire split Whittle from his
founding partner, Moffitt, and they divided the company. Moffitt
took Esquire and Whittle got the rest.
   While the initial reaction was that Moffitt got the best deal,
Whittle saw the writing on the wall. The renamed Whittle
Communications LP plunged headlong into developing wallboards as
advertising vehicles that could be displayed in school lobbies and
gyms and doctor's offices.
   Whittle faces a challenge in running his rapidly expanding
company. He also has expressed interest in running for political
office one day. But he insists his wealth hasn't dulled his
innovative spirit.
   ``The financial reward is only one reason for what I do,'' he
said.

   Car and light truck sales by the nation's Big
Three automakers dropped 0.4 percent in mid-February compared wiith
a year earlier, the companies said Thursday.
   The Big Three said gains in truck sales were offset by losses in
automobile sales.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported
they sold cars and trucks at an average daily rate of 34,580 during
the Feb. 11-20 period, compared with a rate of 34,718 during the
same 1988 period.
   Car sales by the Big Three dropped 3.2 percent, to an average of
21,507 a day from a 22,209 daily average in mid-February last year.
   Truck sales, meanwhile, jumped 4.5 percent to an average of
13,072 a day, compared with a 12,509 a year ago.
   Car sales during January and February 1988 were strong due to
incentives. After a big surge in late December last year, sales have
been running below last year's pace, but Thursday's figures showed a
narrowing of that gap.
   So far in 1989, the Big Three have sold cars and trucks at a pace
4.9 percent slower than a year ago. Car sales showed a big downturn,
dropping 8.4 percent, and truck sales have shown a modest upturn,
rising 1.5 percent.
   Chrysler showed a big dip, falling 18.5 percent during the period
this year. The nation's No. 3 automaker said its average daily sales
rate for cars fell to 2,960, compared with 3,630 last year. Car
sales for 1989 at Chrysler were 15.1 percent below the rate through
mid-February last year.
   Chrysler's truck sales rose 7.1 percent, going to a daily rate of
3,105 compared with a 2,899 daily rate a year ago.
   GM's car sales fell 1.2 percent, dropping to a daily rate of
11,714 from 11,852. For the year, GM's car sales are off 11.8
percent this year.
   GM reported a 3.3 percent gain in truck sales, rising to a daily
rate of 5,169 from a rate of 5,006.
   Ford said its car sales rose 1.6 percent in mid-February, going
to a daily rate of 6,833 compared with 6,727. Ford's annual car
sales are running 0.4 percent ahead of last year, rising to a daily
average of 6,441 from 6,415.
   Ford said it sold an average of 4,798 trucks during the period,
up 4.2 percent from 4,604 in the 1988 period.

   U.S. business failures declined 6.6 percent in
1988 over the previous year, the largest annual drop in a decade,
Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. reported Thursday.
   The business-information company said 57,098 businesses went
under last year, compared with 61,111 in 1987.
   ``The significant decline in failures underscores the continued
strength of the economy, now in its seventh year of expansion,''
said Joseph W. Duncan, chief economist for Dun &amp; Bradstreet.
   ``The nation's weakest regions are showing improvements, while
those areas that led the expansion are holding their own,'' he said.
   The Dun &amp; Bradstreet survey said failures were down in six of the
nation's nine census regions, with only the Middle Atlantic states
reporting a significant increase in business failures.
   The decline in failures was especially notable in states with
agriculture and oil-based economies, according to the survey.
   Among oil businesses, failures were down or flat in seven of the
nine major sectors. Agriculture failures dropped 51.6 percent to
1,823 from 3,766, and failures in the mining sector, which includes
oil and gas extraction, were down 21.2 percent to 494 from 627.
   ``The dramatic decrease in agricultural failures in 1988 is
attributable to the surge in failures in early 1987, as farmers took
advantage of the new Chapter 12 bankruptcy code,'' Duncan said.
   Chapter 12 allows troubled family farmers to reorganize their
debts while being protected from their creditors.
   The report also found that retail failures decreased 6.1 percent
to 11,488 from 12,240, and services bankruptcies were down 4.7
percent to 22,686 from 23,802.
   Manufacturing failures were down 1.6 percent to 4,204, while
wholesale trade failures increased 2.7 percent to 4,455.
Construction failures were essentially unchanged at 6,791.

<HEAD>Bally Calls Off Spinoff Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bally Manufacturing Corp. has canceled a proposed
restructuring because of opposition by New Jersey gaming officials
to a spinoff of its casino-hotel operations.
   Bally had announced in October a plan to make its four casinos _
two in Atlantic City, N.J., and two in Nevada _ a separate, publicly
owned company. Bally had proposed to retain a 15 percent stake in
the new firm.
   But in a preliminary opinion issued Wednesday, the gaming
enforcement division of the New Jersey attorney general's office
objected to the plan. It did not disclose its reasons.
   ``We're not going ahead with the plan because of New Jersey's
opposition,'' Bally spokesman William Peltier said.
   Anthony Parrillo, director of New Jersey's gaming enforcement
division, said the opinion would not be made public unless Bally
pursued the matter before the state Casino Control Commission.
   Parrillo did say his office believed the spinoff would leave
Bally's Atlantic City casino-hotels ``financially weakened.''
   The Chicago Tribune quoted an unidentified source saying the
division's principle objection was that the casino-hotels would have
to take on more debt as part of the spinoff plan.
   The spinoff would have left Bally with a health-club chain; the
Aladdin's Castle video-arcade chain; and three companies that
manufacture fitness, lottery and gaming equipment. Bally sold its
pinball and video-game manufacturing operations last year.

   Stock prices closed lower Thursday as the market
succumbed again to fears about rising world interest rates and the
recent weak trend on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 17.1
points, or 0.8 percent, lower at 2,016.6, having traded as much as
18.4 points lower soon after the opening. The index hit a session
high of 2,030.4, off 3.3 points, at midday.
   Volume was a moderate 551.7 million, compared with 551.6 million
shares Wednesday.
   After proving remarkably resilient in the morning to Wall
Street's steep fall Wednesday, stocks moved sharply lower in the
face of another drop in New York and more weakness in the U.S. bond
market.
   More signs of weakness in the pound also contributed to the
equity market's worries, dashing hopes of a cut in British interest
rates.
   With most players uncertain about the immediate outlook in the
currency markets, large institutional investors preferred to remain
on the sidelines, dealers said.

<HEAD>Dollar Ends Lower In Europe, Gold Up</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged lower in choppy European trading
Thursday as the market remained vaguely bearish but still unsure
about the dollar's outlook. Gold rose.
   Dealers said the dollar was driven lower by skepticism over the
likelihood of higher U.S. interest rates, and by the West German
mark's strength. The mark, in turn, was helped by continuing
speculation that a hike in official West German interest rates would
materialize soon.
   The market is losing its faith that U.S. interest rates are
moving higher, something that would give the dollar strength. A
discount rate hike hasn't materialized despite comments from U.S.
officials such as Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan that
inflationary pressures must be resisted.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
1.7595 dollars to buy one pound, more expensive than 1.7465 dollars
late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday:
1.8215 West German marks, down from 1.8380; 1.5535 Swiss francs,
down from 1.5667; 6.2125 French francs, down from 6.2625; 2.0590
Dutch guilders, down from 2.0725; 1,344.50 Italian lire, down from
1,350.50; 1.1958 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1965.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.33 Japanese yen to a closing 126.29 yen. Later, in
London, it fell further to 126.15 yen.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $391.50 a troy ounce,
compared with $386.30 bid late Wednesday.
   In Zurich, gold rose to close at a bid $391.75 compared with
$386.25 bid late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.99 to close at a bid $389.50.
   Silver bullion prices rose on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $6.04 a troy ounce, compared with
Wednesday's $5.97.

   Stock prices pulled back again today in a

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 42.50 points
Wednesday for its largest loss in three months, dropped 4.82 to

support today from buying by money managers who had been looking for
a pullback in prices to move some of their large cash reserves into

   Wheat and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed while other grain futures finished lower Thursday in a quiet
session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Profit-taking kept the soybean market under pressure after three
days of solid gains. But analysts said Thursday's subdued activity
did not necessarily signal an end to the upswing in soybean prices.
   Analyst Mario Balletto of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc. in
New York noted that the three-day rally followed signs of tightening
soybean supplies, an important fundamental factor that has not
changed.
   The wheat market displayed a mixed reaction to indications that
the Soviet Union had purchased 400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at

   At the close, wheat was { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with the

   Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, the British mining
conglomerate that is the target of a hostile takeover bid from
Minorco SA, reported Thursday that its half-year profit sank 18
percent from a year ago.
   Consolidated Gold Fields said income for the six months ended
Dec. 31 totaled $178 million, or 83 cents a share, compared with
$217 million, or $1.02 a share, the same period a year ago.
   Sales rose 16.6 percent to $1.3 billion from $1.08 billion.
   The 1987 data included a $147 million gain from the sale of
operations, while the 1988 earnings were affected by a $30 million
charge to cover defense costs against Minorco's hostile bid launched
last September.
   Minorco on Monday renewed its attempt to gain control of
Consolidated Gold Fields by offering a sweetened $5.6 billion
cash-and-stock deal.
   The renewed offer came after the South African-controlled Minorco
was cleared earlier this month by the British Monopolies and Mergers
Commission to bid again. Minorco's original bid lapsed when the
matter was referred to the commission last October.
   The company didn't break out quarterly results. It isn't required
to under British law.

<HEAD>State Seeks $1 Million For Corn Oil Adulteration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH EDWARDSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a 22-month investigation, the state
Thursday fined six cooking oil wholesalers more than $1 million for
allegedly diluting and mislabeling corn oil.
   Richard McGuire, commissioner of the state Agriculture and
Markets Department, said the companies mixed cheaper soy oil with
corn oil and then labeled the products pure corn oil.
   He said the state assessed $1,021,997 in penalties from the
firms, four of which are based in New York and two in New Jersey.
   The case of a seventh firm, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., is being
handled by state Attorney General Robert Abrams, McGuire said.
   A state officials said the oil appeared on grocery store shelves
under brand names and store brands, but he didn't specify which ones.
   State investigators conducted the oil probe by collecting samples
from grocery stores and warehouses. The state also subpoenaed
records and officials of oil manufacturers and distributors, McGuire
said.
   An analysis revealed ``widespread economic adulteration of corn
oil,'' he said.
   ``Soy oil is a fine, healthy food product,'' McGuire said. ``The
incentive for this fraud was purely economic. At the time, soy oil
was considerably less expensive than corn oil.''
   The largest penalty, $669,007, was assessed to CBS Food Products
Corp. of Brooklyn. Manager Bob Green said the company will challenge
the penalty.
   The other firms and penalties were Oasis Trading Co., Hillside,
N.J., $216,740; Supreme Oil Co., Englewood, N.J., $130,260; Garden
Chef Foods Inc., $4,680; and K. Kalustyan Orient Expert Trading
Corp., Yonkers, $1,200.
   The penalties were based on rates of $10 per gallon of corn oil
found to be diluted between 10 percent and 50 percent with soy oil,
and $20 per gallon for those diluted in excess of 50 percent.

<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Evan Bayh, signing his first bill into
law, approved a measure Thursday that will give Indiana-based
companies a new defense against hostile takeover attempts.
   Bayh signed Senate Bill 255 during a brief ceremony attended by
legislative leaders.
   The measure backed by many of Indiana's largest companies swept
through the General Assembly in less than one month, winning its
first committee approval on Jan. 31, clearing the Senate on a 47-2
vote and being approved by the House on a 93-5 vote.
   S.B. 255, which is effective retroactively to the end of January,
expands on a section of Indiana's historic 1986 anti-takeover law.
   The measure states that boards of directors, when considering
buyout bids, can weigh factors other than getting the top-dollar
price for shareholders. The new law says that directors can also
weigh the interests of constituents such as employees, suppliers,
customers and the communities in which the companies are located.
   ``I think it's appropriate that the boards of directors take into
account the interests of the people of Indiana and not just the Wall
Street brokers,'' said Bayh, a Democrat who took office Jan. 9.
   Indiana's 1986 anti-takeover law has been copied by other states
since its adoption and a 1987 U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding
the law and a state's attempt to protect its own companies.
   However, Indiana-based companies decided the 1986 statute needed
strengthening after courts in Delaware, which has a similar law,
ruled last year that shareholders' interest in getting the best
return on their investments should be a board's primary standard in
evaluating takeover bids.
   The measure had the support of both Cummins Engine Co. and Arvin
Industries, two Columbus-based corporations. A British company
currently owns almost 10 percent of Cummins stock and an Indonesian
company announced recently it has purchased 5.6 percent of Arvin's
stock.

<HEAD>Pan Am Narrows Loss to $51.7 Million in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pan Am Corp. said Thursday it lost $51.7 million
in the fourth quarter of 1988, a narrowing the airline said was
aided in part by lower labor costs and an improved marketing
strategy.
   The nation's eighth-largest airline reported that losses fell
from $245.5 million in the same 1987 quarter. Fourth-quarter revenue
rose 11.4 percent to $839.9 million from $753.9 million a year
earlier.
   ``While we are not satisfied with our financial results, we do
believe that significant progress has been made in 1988 toward the
stabilization and improvement of our principal subsidiary, Pan
American World Airways,'' Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said in
a statement.
   He said the airline is now realizing benefits of lower labor
costs, had a year-end cash position of around $290 million, has
instituted an effective marketing plan and has enhanced its service
product.
   But Plaskett said the first quarter of 1989 will show a loss
greater than the 1988 first quarter. Pan Am lost $83.3 million in
that period.
   ``The increased loss results from a combination of higher
expenses...as well as lower revenue resulting principally from a
traffic shortfall in our Atlantic division,'' he said.
   Earlier this month, Plaskett said in a speech that Pan Am needs
to merge with another airline to ensure its survival. The statement
sent the company's stock soaring on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Pan Am recently put up for sale its profitable World Services
subsidiary, which markets security, maintenance and other services
to government agencies and other airlines. Financial analysts
estimate the unit's potential sale value at around $200 million.
   For all of 1988, Pan Am narrowed its net loss to $72.7 million
from $265.3 million in 1987. Revenue for 1988 jumped 16.8 percent to
$3.57 billion from $3.05 billion the year before.
   The 1988 results include a gain of $89.1 million from the sale of
options on 16 Airbus A320s to Braniff Inc.

   A half-dozen schools are each getting $50,000 in
television equipment in exchange for their participation in Whittle
Communications LP's test next month of Channel One, a commercial
news program for teen-agers.
   The project represents the Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company's
first venture in satellite-delivered television and it has raised
concerns among some educators about the propriety of allowing paid
advertising into classrooms.
   But if the test proves successful, Whittle chairman Christopher
Whittle hopes to take the project into 8,000 or more schools in the
fall of 1990 at a cost in hardware alone of more than $100 million.
   He said the project was designed to enable schools to obtain a
sophisticated television system they may not otherwise be able to
afford while giving students a useful embellishment to their daily
education.
   Whittle said he hopes to sign advertisers to long-term
commitments to the news program in exchange for getting product
exclusivity on the network and the ability to reach a teenage
audience that has often proven elusive.
   The program will be produced each weekday in Los Angeles and
beamed via satellite to the participating schools in time for the
principal to review it. Schools are expected to run the program once
each schoolday although school officials have the right not to air
it if they find something objectionable.
   Whittle plans to assemble a news staff of about 100 if the
project is taken national, and he has already sent a crew to the
Soviet Union to do a series on a day in the life of a Soviet
teen-ager.
   A pilot of the 12-minute program, which includes four 30-second
commercial spots, ran like this:
   _News headlines in which an announcer reads several brief stories
accompanied by purchased film footage to illustrate it.
   _A focus piece produced by the Channel One staff on someone
interesting to teens, such as an interview with the daughter of an
American hostage in Lebanon.
   _Following a one-minute commercial break, another Channel
One-produced segment of a weekly five-part series on topics such as
environmental pollution.
   _A pop quiz poses a question and, following another commercial
break, provides the answer.
   _A Channel One-produced feature story which in the pilot mixes a
music video with historical scenes from the life of the Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr.
   The six schools participating in the test starting March 6 are
Eisenhower Middle School in Kansas City; Mumford High School in
Detroit; Central High School in Knoxville; Billerica Memorial High
School in Billerica, Mass.; Withrow High School in Cincinnati; and
Gahr High School in Cerritos, Calif.

   Stock prices edged upward today, steadying after
Wednesday's sharp drop.
   Analysts said the markets were still struggling to recover from
the jolt of the report Wednesday that the consumer price index
jumped 0.6 percent in January.
   The news sent bond prices lower and stepped up expectations that
the Federal Reserve might feel compelled to tighten credit further
and faster than it had previously planned.
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, described the report as
``disturbing.''
   With all that, however, brokers said blue chips attracted some
support today from buying by money managers who had been looking for
a pullback in prices to move some of their large cash reserves into
stocks.

<HEAD>Soviets Buy 400,000 Metric Tons of U.S. Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought an additional
400,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   The wheat was part of a Jan. 25 authorization of more than 2
million tons under the Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, said
Christopher E. Goldthwait, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   He said the wheat is for shipment for March. Counting some left
over from a previous EEP arrangement and the Jan. 25 authorization,
the Soviets have more than 1.01 million tons still available under
the program.
   With the latest sale, the Soviet Union has bought about 3 million
tons of wheat for delivery in the sixth year of a long-term supply
agreement, which was extended last fall to run through Dec. 31, 1990.
   A metric tons is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 400,000 tons are equal to about 14.7 million bushels
worth around $60 million at recent U.S. farm prices of $4.08 per
bushel.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Sales for delivery in the sixth year of the agreement also
included about 10.2 million tons of corn, along with 450,000 tons of
soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of
grain sorghums.
   Goldthwait said 300,000 tons of wheat were sold by Louis Dreyfus
Corp. and 100,000 tons by Cargill Inc.
   The companies will get subsidies of $22.06 per ton, or about 60
cents per bushel, under the EEP arrangement.

<HEAD>Venezuela Suspends Repayment of Private Sector's Foreign Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Venezuela has suspended capital
payments on about $5 billion in private-sector debt owed to creditor
banks, mainly in the United States, according to a published report
Thursday.
   The decision, which affects $472 million in principal due this
year, was called ``unprecedented'' by the independent newspaper El
Nacional.
   There was no immediate official confirmation of the decision and
the newspaper did not provide a source for the information.
   Bankers and businessmen had mixed reactions to the report but
said it did not come as a surprise.
   Private-sector debt was being paid off in an eight-year period
dating from 1986, at preferential rates granted by the Venezuelan
government, one businessman said.
   ``I don't think anyone expected the debt to be recognized at
preferential rates over the whole eight-year period,'' said the
businessman, owner of an electric parts plant, who did not want his
name used.
   ``But it will hurt some people who have not paid off the debt in
full,'' he added.
   The decision would add to the suspension in January of capital
repayments totaling more than $20.4 billion owed by the public
sector to foreign banks.
   Venezuela's total foreign debt of $33 billion is Latin America's
fourth largest after Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Venezuela
recently began talks with its creditors to define new repayment
terms.
   Suspension of principal payments on both the private and public
sectors' foreign debts affects a total of $2 billion due this year,
the newspaper reported.
   A representative for an international bank said the decision
would ``create real problems'' for international bankers.
   ``The initial decision was a signed and sealed agreement. We'll
have to start all over now,'' said the banker, who asked not to be
named.
   He said he expected a new refinancing of the private sector debt
to include some sort of subsidy, otherwise many companies would be
forced into bankruptcy.
   As of January 1987, the private sector's debt totaled $4.97
billion. Capital payments for 1989 represented 9.5 percent of that
total, the newspaper said.
   Venezuela's private-sector foreign debt had been paid off
regularly over the past few years and the suspension ordered by the
Social Democratic government implies a ``radical change'' in the
nation's strategy with its creditors, according to El Nacional.
   ``Besides suspending amortization on the private sector's debt,
the government will demand this debt be granted the same treatment
to be accorded for the public sector's debt,'' the report said.
   That would represent a repayment period of 20 years, up from
eight begining in 1987, six to seven years of grace, and
rescheduling of interest payments.
   A greater problem, according to many business leaders, is what to
do about some $6.8 billion in letters of credit owed to financial
institutions.
   ``The government says the IMF is only willing to grant fresh
money if the letters of credit are paid off at free market rates.
But we see it as a violation of the rules we were operating under.
We never asked for those rules,'' said a business representative.
   The letters of credit were granted to businesses at preferential
rates, but negotiations between Venezuela and the International
Monetary Fund are trying to determine which of those letters of
credit must be paid back at free market rates, as part of the IMF's
austerity program.
   A team of Venezuelan negotiators are scheduled to travel to the
United States on Sunday, including central bank president Pedro
Tinoco, planning minister Miguel Rodriguez, and finance minister
Eglee Iturbe, to sign a letter of intent with the IMF for fresh
loans, said press accounts.
   Contingent on the signing with the IMF will be additional funds
forthcoming from the central bank of Spain and the U.S. Federal
Reserve worth some $1.1 billion to prop up Venezuela's reserves,
depleted to just 1.5 billion dollars in operative money, said El
Nacional.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 445 money market mutual
funds rose $3.25 billion in the latest week to hit a new all-time
high of $292.39 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday shattered the
previous record of $289.14 billion set a week earlier from a $1.58
billion increase, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.
   The biggest weekly rise in the funds' assets _ $9.64 billion in
the week ended Oct. 21, 1987 _ came during the stock market collapse
as investors sought safe havens for their money.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 224 general purpose funds rose $496.5 million to $92.8
billion, assets of 93 broker-dealer funds increased $1.88 billion to
$125.20 billion, and assets of 138 institutional funds rose $879.7
million to $74.39 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.52 percent from 8.44 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.43 percent from 8.39 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 31
days, unchanged from the previous week, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.36 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.37 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW
accounts, was to 5.14 percent, unchanged.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.57
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 8.48 the
previous week. Yields were 8.80 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 8.74
percent; 8.85 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.78 percent; and 8.90
percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.86 percent.

<HEAD>Two More Wiring Problems Reported As Boeing Announces Changes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wiring problems in two more jetliners have been
reported by a Boeing Co. customer, and the plane manufacturer says
it is studying possible changes in its assembly line to address the
matter.
   Air Canada discovered the latest wiring mixups on two of its
Boeing 767 passenger jets. Boeing passed the reports on to the
Federal Aviation Administration last week.
   Boeing confirmed on Wednesday that the repeated wiring mishaps
have prompted the company to start an engineering study in an effort
to prevent crossed wires and pipes in all Boeing models.
   ``There would be changes in the plugs and sockets so that, for
example, an individual wire can only go into a particular socket,''
Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said.
   Martin said the study to modify plugs and sockets was also in
response, in part, to the fire-suppression wiring problems detected
on Boeing 757s, as well as problems noted on other Boeing aircraft.
   He said company executives were supervising studies by three
engineering teams, but it was not known when changes might be made
or what the costs might be.
   Boeing hopes to find an ``across-the-board solution'' that will
make assembly of the units consistent and foolproof ``as much as
possible,'' Martin said.
   Some Boeing aircraft fire safety systems are color-coded or keyed
to prevent wrong hookups, but others have identical fittings for
different parts of the systems, he said.
   The Air Canada reports followed a flap between Boeing and the FAA
over apparent delays in reporting similar wiring problems in at
least seven other Boeing aircraft since last August.
   Some of the mishaps were not reported by Boeing until last month.
   Boeing officials called the delays a ``misunderstanding'' but
changed the company's reporting procedures this week to ensure
``timely reporting,'' said Philip Condit, Boeing's executive vice
president.

<HEAD>Bankrupt Appliance Maker Agrees To Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc., the financially
troubled small appliance maker, agreed Thursday to be acquired and
kept intact for more than $800 million by a New York securities firm
it snubbed last month.
   Investors led by Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
are ready to pay $60 million for a 62 percent stake in the
Pittsburgh company currently reorganizing under federal bankruptcy
laws.
   The deal also would provide $747 million, including $541 million
in cash and $184 million in securities, to settle debts.
   The plan, subject to the approval of a bankruptcy court judge and
creditors, replaces management's plan to sell the valued
Oster-Sunbeam appliances division and have Allegheny International
stand alone.
   Banks whose claims are secured by company assets and other
institutions with unsecured debt would be paid the full value of
their claims. Certain senior unsecured debt would be paid at a rate
of 95 cents on the dollar.
   The takeover would be financed with Allegheny International's
cash, bank loans, bonds and other securities, along with DLJ's
investment. Preferred and common shareholders would be left with 38
percent of the company.
   ``The proposed new merger with DLJ provides us with the most
viable route for emergence from Chapter 11 protection,'' said
Allegheny International Chairman Oliver S. Travers. ``It enables us
to keep our customer products business intact, which always had been
our hope.''
   Management proposed the asset sale after accusing DLJ of cutting
a backroom deal with a rival bidder, the New York merchant bank firm
Joseph, Littlejohn &amp; Levy. The bankers were to purchase Allegheny
International's gas grill and lawn furniture businesses.
   Allegheny International in January withdrew its approval of the
first DLJ takeover plan.

<HEAD>GAO Official Says Sanctions Don't Necessarily Indicate Degree of
Abuse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A General Accounting Office official said
Thursday that the number of disciplinary actions taken against
commodities traders in recent years does not necessarily indicate
the degree of abuse at the nation's biggest futures markets.
   Richard Fogel, assistant comptroller general at the GAO, which is
Congress' auditing arm, also said results of an ongoing FBI
investigation of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board
of Trade may give a better idea of possible abuses in the
commodities pits.
   The federal government has subpoenaed more than 100 traders and
brokers in connection with a sweeping undercover investigation of
trading abuses alleged to have defrauded exchange customers of
millions of dollars.
   The GAO stated the number of contracts traded at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange grew from 40 million in 1984 to 80 million in
1988, and at the Chicago Board of Trade from 80 million to 140
million during the same period.
   The number of traders sanctioned for violations on the floor of
the Merc rose from 13 in 1984 to 105 in 1988, while sanctions at the
Board of Trade went from a low of eight in 1985 to a high of 32 in
1986. In 1988, the Board of Trade sanctioned 13 floor participants.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., called the number of sanctions taken
against traders ``pitiful'' given the volume of trading.
   Fogel said the numbers could reflect an oversight system that is
working well or one that needs improvement because it is not
detecting abuses or punishing offenders severely enough.
   Fogel's testimony came at the first Senate oversight hearing this
year on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
commodities markets and is up for congressional reauthorization this
year.
   The CFTC's policing of commodities markets has come under fire
from a number of critics since the federal probe was disclosed
earlier this year.
   Separately, Wendy Lee Gramm, chairwoman of the CFTC, said the
agency has not yet responded to a request that it delay approving
new types of futures contracts until completion of the FBI probe and
a review of the commodities markets by the House Agriculture
Committee.
   Gramm made her comments in response to questions from reporters
following a speech in New York. Earlier this week, members of the
Agriculture Committee asked the agency to hold off considering
proposals it has pending.
   At the hearing, Fogel said Mercantile Exchange fines for trade
practice abuses totaled $3.6 million from 1984 to 1988. For the same
period, comparable Board of Trade fines were $811,000.
   The number of members expelled on both exchanges averaged about
two a year, Fogel said. He said exchange officials consider
permanent expulsion or lengthy suspensions as more severe than fines
because they deprive members of their livelihood.
   Fogel said CFTC officials told the GAO they could not comment on
their involvement in identifying or investigating alleged abuses
until after any indictments stemming from the FBI probe are issued.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Gold Closes Higher</HEAD>

   The dollar slipped lower Thursday as pessimism
about the U.S. budget and trade deficits weighed on the foreign
exchange markets.
   Gold prices moved higher. Republic National Bank of New York
quoted a late bid of $390.70 for a troy ounce of gold, up from
$386.40 late Wednesday.
   Analysts said the dollar declined as traders became convinced the
Bush administration had no firm plan to deal with the budget and
trade gaps.
   Interest rates have continued to edge higher, which should
support the dollar, ``but we still have twin deficits and no
resolution on that,'' said Dan Holland, an analyst at Discount Corp.
   Holland said traders also were concerned that the Federal Reserve
might be cautious in raising interest rates so as not to burden the
struggling savings and loan industry.
   Traders see Washington as placing a relatively low priority on
supporting the dollar, said Holland, who predicted the U.S. currency
could return to the levels where it traded before the November
election.
   Overseas dealers said the dollar was driven lower by skepticism
that U.S. interest rates will rise, and by the West German mark's
strength. The mark, in turn, was helped by continuing speculation
that a hike in official West German interest rates would materialize
soon.
   After the close of trading in New York, two major banks announced
they were raising their prime lending rate half a percentage point
to 11.5 percent, the second increase in two weeks. However, prime
rate hikes tend to follow, and not portend, increases in other
interest rates.
   The dollar began its day in Tokyo, falling 0.33 Japanese yen to a
closing 126.29 yen. Later, in London, it fell further to 126.15 yen,
and in New York, it slipped to 126.175 yen from late Wednesday's
126.525.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7595 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.7465 late
Wednesday. In later New York trading, the pound rose to $1.7605 from
late Wedneday's $1.7470.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.82175 West German marks, down from
1.83425; 1.5505 Swiss francs, down from 1.56575; 6.2160 French
francs, down from 6.2555; 1,342.50 Italian lire, down from 1,349.75;
and 1.19485 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19985.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, included: 1.8215 West German marks, down from 1.8380; 1.5535
Swiss francs, down from 1.5667; 6.2125 French francs, down from
6.2625; 2.0590 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0725; 1,344.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,350.50; 1.1958 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1965.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed at $391 a troy
ounce, up from $386.90 late Wednesday.
   Gold rose earlier in London to a late bid price of $391.50 a troy
ounce, compared with $386.30 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold
rose to close at a bid $391.75, compared with $386.25 bid late
Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold rose $1.99 to close at a bid $389.50.
   Silver bullion prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange,
silver closed at $5.931, down slightly from late Wednesday's $5.935.
In London, the metal traded at a late bid price of $6.04 a troy
ounce, compared with Wednesday's $5.97.

   Chrysler Corp. said Thursday it plans to replace
an aging Detroit assembly plant with a new $1 billion factory that
will make a new sport-utility vehicle beginning in 1992, betting
that demand for such vehicles will continue growing into the next
decade.
   The vehicle, code-named the ``ZJ,'' will be available in Jeep and
Dodge dealers and will be the first sport-utility vehicle carrying
the Dodge nameplate.
   Details about the ZJ _ which will be available in two models _
will not be given until production begins in January 1992. But
Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said it would be larger than the Jeep
Cherokee now being made at a Toledo, Ohio plant.
   Chrysler said it will continue manufacturing Jeep Cherokees in
Toledo after 1992, when its current five-year contract with the
United Auto Workers union expires.
   ``The `ZJ' is basically a vehicle that is for another segment of
the market,'' Nicoll said. ``It is not a replacement for the
Cherokee. It is targeted at an upscale market.''
   The current base price for a two-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee is
about $12,374. Four-wheel-drive and options can push the cost much
higher.
   The ZJ is the second new sport-utility vehicle for the 1990s that
Chrysler has announced this month.
   Chairman Lee Iacocca said Feb. 2 that Chrysler and the French
automaker Renault would collaborate on a ``mini-sport-utility
vehicle'' code-named the ``JJ.'' It will be assembled at one factory
in the United States and another either in Spain or Portugal
beginning in mid-1992.
   The base price for the JJ would be less than $10,000, Iacocca
said.
   The ZJ will be the only vehicle produced at Chrysler's new
Jefferson North plant, which will replace the company's aging
Jefferson Avenue assembly plant. Full production is expected to be
about 200,000 vehicles a year.
   Sales of utility vehicles of all sizes, from compacts like the
Suzuki Samurai to large ones like the Ford Bronco, have risen from
6.3 percent of the truck market in 1980 to 16.3 percent last year.
   It was too early to tell how many of the new vehicles would be
allocated to Dodge and how many would go to Jeep, Nicoll said. Final
names for the vehicles won't be determined for two to three years,
he said.
   The Jefferson Avenue plant, which has been producing cars since
1925, now makes the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon cars. Nicoll
said the company was unsure whether the Onmi or Horizon nameplates
would continue after the plant is shut down.
   Construction of the Jefferson North plant on Detroit's east side
is to begin in April, Nicoll said.
   Chrysler indicated it was optimistic that problems regarding
chemical deposits on the plant site and acquisition of the land by
the city of Detroit would be cleared up by the time construction is
to start.
   Any delays in land acquisition or environmental cleanup in turn
could delay the startup, and significant delays could jeopardize the
project, Nicoll said.

   Petroleum futures turned in a mixed performance
Thursday with crude prices nearly flat in lackluster trading on the
New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, closed the day down 1 cent at $17.83 a
barrel. Contracts for later delivery were unchanged to 4 cents lower.
   Among refined products, March heating oil rose 0.44 cent to 50.59
cents a gallon after jumping 1.23 cents on Wednesday in response to
an industry report showing an unexpected decline in inventories.
   Unleaded gasoline for March settled at 49.74 cents a gallon, up
0.67 cent. Analysts said there was no fresh news to move the market
although beginning investor concern about a seasonal decline in
demand for crude oil might have influenced prices somewhat.
   Activity in the gasoline pits reflected some concern about the
possibility of higher retail gasoline prices this summer. Analysts
said buyers were trying to lock in lower prices for summer
deliveries. Gasoline prices scheduled for delivery between June and
November were up 1.03 cents to 1.30 cents a gallon.
   The concern stems from the possibility that some Northeastern
states will impose new regulations requiring motorists to use higher
octane gasoline. The states are awaiting Environmental Protection
Agency approval.
   Refining capacity already is tight and the new gasoline would
require refiners to use more oil to produce a smaller amount of
motor fuel.

   Mid-February sales of U.S.-based companies' cars
and light trucks rose 1.7 percent from year-earlier levels as the
effects of sales incentives available in early 1988 began to wear
off, the automakers said Thursday.
   The eight automakers said they sold cars and light trucks at an
average daily rate of 36,769 during the Feb. 11-20 period this year,
compared with a daily rate of 35,158 during the same time last year.
   There were eight selling days during the period this year and
nine last year, so percentage changes in sales are based on a daily
selling rate rather than on total sales.
   The overall sales rate during the period was bolstered by a 5.4
percent increase in truck sales, which offset a 0.3 percent decline
in car sales.
   Sales during the first six weeks of last year were heavily
influenced by buyer incentives offered by the automakers. Incentives
including cash rebates and low financing deals were offered this
year for a narrower range of cars and trucks.
   For the year to date, car and truck sales by domestic producers
fell 3.2 percent to an average daily rate of 32,334, compared with
33,412 last year. There were 42 selling days between Jan. 1 and Feb.
20 this year, one fewer than during the same time last year.
   The daily sales rate for cars was down 6.3 percent during the
period, while truck sales were up 1.5 percent.
   Chrysler Corp. mid-February car sales fell 18.5 percent from the
same period last year. The nation's No. 3 automaker said its average
daily sales rate for cars fell to 2,960 during mid-February from
3,630 a year earlier.
   For the year to date, Chrysler's car sales were down 15.1 percent
from a year earlier.
   Chrysler's truck sales were up 7.1 percent during the
mid-February period, to a daily rate of 3,105 from 2,899 last year.
   Joseph Phillippi, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton in New
York, agreed with Chrysler executives who recently predicted that a
short supply of cars due to model changeover might depress sales
numbers during early 1989.
   General Motors Corp. car sales fell 1.2 percent during
mid-February, dropping to a daily rate of 11,714 this year from
11,852 during the period last year. For the year to date, GM's car
sales are down 11.8 percent.
   GM truck sales were up 3.3 percent during the mid-February
period, rising to a daily rate of 5,169 from 5,006 a year earlier.
   Ford Motor Co. said its car sales rose 1.6 percent in
mid-February this year over last year, going to a daily rate of
6,833 from 6,727 last year. Ford's car sales are running 0.4 percent
ahead of car sales to date last year, rising to a daily average of
6,441 from 6,415.
   Ford said it sold an average of 4,798 trucks a day during the
period this year, up 4.2 percent from 4,604 last year.

<HEAD>Money Supply Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three key measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Feb. 13, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $784.0 million from $787.2 million the previous
week, the Fed said.
   The broader measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted
$3,066.9 billion from $3,067.5 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, decreased to a seasonally adjusted
$3,921.6 billion from $3,923.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   In congressional testimony on Tuesday, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan reaffirmed a target for 1989 of 3 percent to 7 percent
growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent growth in M3. The Fed
set the targets on a provisional basis last year. The central bank
has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M1 averaged $787.8 million, a 1.8
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13
weeks. M2 averaged $3,068.7 billion, up 3.9 percent, while M3 rose
5.1 percent to an average of $3,917.7 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $75 million,
compared with a gain of $2.1 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window averaged $534 million, up from
$197 million.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the monetary
base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at
Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation,
was $287.1 billion in the two-week period ended Wednesday, down from
$287.4 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>General Electric Settles Five Lawsuits For $3.5 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. has agreed to pay the
government $3.5 million to settle five civil lawsuits for claims
including defense contract fraud, lawyers said Thursday.
   Four of the suits were filed under the False Claims Act of 1863,
which allows citizens to sue a defense contractor to try and recover
money for the federal government.
   James Helmer Jr., a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the
government has agreed to give the four ``whistleblower'' plaintiffs
$770,000, or 22 percent, of the $3.5 million settlement.
   ``This is the largest amount of money ever recovered by the
United States in one of these actions,'' Helmer said. ``This was a
tremendous recovery for the United States' taxpayers.''
   The lawsuits, filed around the country, were consolidated in
Cincinnati for handling by U.S. District Judge Carl Rubin.
   John M. Gravitt, a former machinists' foreman at GE's suburban
Evendale jet engine-producing plant, alleged in a 1984 suit that GE
altered about 9,000 daily labor vouchers for defense contract work
done for the government.
   Stamford, Conn.-based GE denied the allegations and proposed a
$234,000 settlement federal prosecutors recommended in 1985. But the
judge rejected the settlement as inadequate. The case was to go to
trial Monday.
   GE spokesman Richard Kennedy said: ``There never was any
deliberate attempt by GE to defraud the government.''
   The company had denied the claims in the lawsuits, which charged
GE with various wrongdoings and falsifications of records. One suit
charged that a GE supplier allegedly paid bribes to a GE buyer.
   In the fifth case, which was not filed under the False Claims
Act, a California company alleged that GE refused its business
because its owner was Hispanic. GE denied the claim.

<TEXT>
   Labor leaders staged a rowdy show of support
Thursday for Machinists planning to strike Eastern Airlines,
receiving a boost from the airline's pilots while predicting
President Bush would intervene to stop a walkout.
   The AFL-CIO Executive Council joined members of the Machinists
and other unions at a noisy rally at Eastern's headquarters.
   Buoyed by the presence of more than a dozen Eastern pilots, the
labor leaders predicted they would mount a unified front and stall
air travel and cargo if the 8,500 machinists and ground personnel
strike Eastern as planned March 4.
   ``I'm here to let the Machinists know we're going to help them,''
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said as he and about 1,000 Eastern
workers and supporters marched in front of Eastern's operations
yard. ``We've got a special effort here, all the unions in the
federation are showing their support.''
   The union is threatening to strike because of what it considers
$150 million in unreasonable concessions demanded by Eastern.
   Kirkland said organized labor would do ``everything possible
within the law'' to halt Eastern, sister carrier Continental
Airlines and their parent company, Texas Air Corp., in the event of
a strike.
   On hand for the rally were a handful of uniformed Eastern pilots
and several officials from their union, including one who sparked
the ire of several AFL-CIO leaders by saying Wednesday the pilots
would cross Machinist picket lines if Eastern management ``makes it
worth our while.''
   That official, Rick Chapman, secretary treasurer of the Eastern
pilots union, contended he was quoted out of context.
   ``We support the membership of the IAM,'' said Chapman, who
apologized to Kirkland and William Winpisinger, president of the
International Association of Machinists, for any trouble his
Wednesday statement had caused.
   The pilots, according to union policy, will not decide whether to
honor Machinist picket lines until there is a strike. But a pilot,
Bob Breslin, said the ``momentum is growing very rapidly'' to side
with the Machinists.
   Airline pilots, however, have traditionally spoiled labor's hopes
of crippling airlines during strikes by crossing picket lines.
   Eastern management, which has said it plans to operate in the
event of a strike, made its presence felt as well.
   A sign hanging from a company building read: ``Welcome AFL-CIO
delegates. Eastern, your official airline.'' During the rally a
small plane flew overhead toting a banner reading, ``Eastern,
official airline of the AFL-CIO.''
   Most of the federation officials gathered in nearby Bal Harbour
for the AFL-CIO leadership's annual meeting flew here on Eastern,
which offered a group discount. Federation officials have
acknowledged the irony in that but said they encourage people to fly
Eastern because they want the financially strapped airline to
survive.
   The rally was part of labor's dual strategy of preparing for a
strike while at the same time trying to pressure Bush to name an
emergency board and automatically delay the March 4 strike deadline
by 60 days.
   ``I have no reason to believe the president won't do that,''
Winpisinger said when asked if he expected Bush to name an emergency
board if last-ditch mediation under way in Washington fails.
   Kirkland called on Bush to name the board ``for the sake of the
future of the airline, for the sake of the communities Eastern
serves, for the sake of the country.''
   Machinists leaders said there would have been a larger crowd at
the rally but that Eastern invoked mandatory overtime rules and
forced several hundred employees to work past 3:30 p.m., when the
rally was to begin.

<HEAD>Gramm Says FDIC To Dispose of Fail Thrift Assets In `Orderly Fashion'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. plans to
sell repossessed real estate from failed savings and loans in Texas
``at a good price'' after Congress approves a multibillion dollar
bailout package, Sen. Phil Gramm said Thursday.
   Gramm said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman plans to establish
``an orderly process'' for disposing of billions of dollars in
assets from failed savings and loans in Texas so the state's
economic recovery is not disrupted.
   Those assets _ including office buildings, hotels, motels,
apartments, single family homes and shopping centers _ will not be
sold at ``firesale prices,'' the Texas Republican said after meeting
with Seidman.
   Seidman plans to announce the effort in Texas after Congress
passes President Bush's proposal to bail out the savings and loan
industry.
   Gramm said dumping the assets on the Texas market at rock bottom
prices would send real estate prices in the state plummeting.
   Flooding the market would have a ``cataclysmic impact on banks
and savings and loans that are not insolvent, stop all
construction'' and set the state's recovery back three or four years.
   Sen. Timothy Worth, D-Colo., said $7.5 billion in assets from
failed thrifts are currently being held by the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corp. A large part of that portfolio is held in Texas.
   Under Bush's proposed plan to restructure the thrift regulatory
system, the FDIC would have responsibility for insuring both
commercial banks and savings and loans. FSLIC would be merged into
the FDIC, giving the FDIC responsiblity for the repossessed assets.

   Imperial Chemical Industries PLC of
London reported its profit for the fourth quarter of 1988 rose 13
percent, while earnings for all of 1988 increased about 10 percent
to a record level.
   ICI, whose American affiliate, ICI Americas Inc., has its
headquarters here, said it earned $369 million, or $2.16 per
American Depository Receipt, in the fourth quarter, compared with a
profit of $324 million, or $1.92 per ADR, in the fourth quarter of
1987.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $5.39 billion, up about 5.5 percent
from the $5.10 billion reported for the fourth quarter of 1987.
   Earnings for 1988 totaled about $1.5 billion, or $8.87 per ADR,
compared with the $1.37 billion, or $8.18 per ADR, reported in 1987.
   Sales in 1988 rose about 5 percent to $21 billion from 1987's
sales of $20 billion.
   Harry Corless, chairman of ICI Americas Inc., said 1988 ``was
another year of rapid progress, with sales up 21 percent (in the
United States) and trading profits up 37 percent (in the United
States) in local currency against the background of a booming U.S.
economy.''
   ICI is involved in industrial chemicals, agricultural chemicals,
biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and consumer products.

FNN's chairman said Thursday.
   Chairman Earl Brian made the statement in a memo to FNN employees
that he said was issued after some of them asked about a report in
Hollywood Reporter.
   The publication on Wednesday quoted a cable industry source it
did not identify as saying ``the ownership of Financial News Network
could change hands within days.''
   FNN operates a cable television service that offers business and
sports programs. The company has been a periodic subject of takeover
speculation.
   Brian has previously acknowledged that FNN has been discussing
joint programming ventures with a number of major broadcast
companies.
   ``...it is correct that over the last several months we have
received, and have been considering, several preliminary proposals
for possible joint venture or business combination transactions
involving FNN,'' Brian wrote.
   ``We have not agreed to any proposal at this time and there is no
assurance that we will reach an acceptable agreement. We will
continue to evaluate such strategic alternatives. The evaluation
process may take some time,'' he said.
   FNN's biggest shareholder is Infotechnology Inc., a New
York-based media concern which also has an interest in a company
that manages United Press International.
   Brian, who is also chairman of Infotech, said last month he had
no plans to sell Infotech's 43 percent stake in FNN.
   In the first half of its fiscal year, FNN earned $1.2 million, or
7 cents a share, on revenue of $28.7 million for the six months
ended Dec. 31.
   In national over-the-counter trading, FNN was unchanged Wednesday
at $8.75 a share.

<HEAD>Oscar Mayer Wishes Bryan Would Stop Claiming To Be Number One, Files
Suit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Hog dog maker Oscar Mayer Foods Corp. filed suit
Thursday against rival Bryan Foods Inc., claiming the food processor
has been running television commercials in the South that are full
of baloney.
   Bryan, a Mississippi-based subsidiary of Sara Lee Corp.,
advertises its products as the best-selling ``throughout the
South,'' and its commercials tout the Southern-exclusivity of Bryan
hot dogs, bacon and bologna.
   Oscar Mayer, a Madison, Wis.-based subsidiary of Philip Morris
Cos. Inc., asked the U.S. District Court here to force Sara Lee to
pull the ads. The suit also seeks unspecified monetary damages,
including trebled punitive damages.
   The suit contends Bryan's claims of taste superiority are based
on invalid research and that Oscar Mayer products, not Bryan's, are
the region's top sellers.
   ``Continuously since 1984, ... Oscar Mayer hot dogs, bologna and
bacon each have been the top-selling brands in the southern United
States or `the South,''' the lawsuit says. ``Continuously since
1984, ... Oscar Mayer hot dogs, bologna and bacon have had a far
greater market share in the South than Bryan's respective products.''
   Sara Lee spokeswoman Anne McCarthy said the Chicago-based company
had not seen the lawsuit and does not comment on pending litigation.
   Oscar Mayer marketing Vice President Bryan Stockton said the
company complained to the Better Business Bureau and the National
Advertising Review Board, but ``Sara Lee has continued to produce
television commercials which inaccurately portray the competitive
situation between Oscar Mayer and Bryan Foods in the southern part
of the U.S.''
   Oscar Mayer said it notified Bryan of its objections in 1984. The
company said the BBB's National Advertising Division agreed in 1985
that Bryan ``could not support a claim to market leadership
throughout the South.''
   The suit claims Bryan agreed to change its advertising to clarify
the context of its ``best-selling'' claims, but failed to honor the
promise.

<HEAD>USAir Agrees to Buy Up To 40 Planes from McDonnell Douglas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir Group Inc. said Thursday it has agreed to
buy as many as 40 MD-82 aircraft from manufacturer McDonnell Douglas
Corp.
   USAir said it has signed a letter of intent to place firm orders
for 20 of the aircraft and take options on 20 more. The two
companies are currently negotiating a definitive contract, USAir
said in a brief statement.
   The first two of the new planes would be delivered in September
1992 and the remainder of the firm orders and options, if taken,
would be delivered to USAir at the rate of one per month starting in
January 1993.
   The planes will carry about 140 passengers.
   Washington-based USAir, the nation's ninth-largest airline, said
it is a long-time operator of McDonnell Douglas aircraft.
   The announcement marks the second victory this month for St.
Louis-based McDonnell Douglas in its competition with rival aircraft
makers Boeing Co. and the Airbus Industrie consortium of Europe.
   American Airlines said Feb. 7 it had signed an agreement with
McDonnell Douglas to acquire at least eight new long-range MD-11
jetliners with options to buy another 42. The airline also took
options on 100 MD-80s, a smaller plane designed to replace the
Boeing 727.
   Industry experts estimate the American deal could total about $7
billion, making it potentially one of the biggest aircraft orders in
history.

   Congressional tax analysts estimated Thursday
that the capital-gains tax reduction proposed by President Bush as a
revenue-raiser would actually reduce tax collections by $24.2
billion over the next six years.
   The Bush administration calculates the president's proposal would
increase revenues by $9.3 billion during the 1989-94 period.
   ``Who's right?'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, asked in releasing the report from the
staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation. ``That's the first thing
we'll have to determine when the Finance Committee takes this matter
up.''
   Just two years ago, the Treasury Department estimated a
capital-gains cut would lose $21.8 billion over five years. ``It may
be significant that Joint Tax is far closer to what Treasury was
saying two years ago than what Treasury itself is saying today,''
Bentsen said.
   Bentsen has indicated he could live with a reduction in the
capital-gains rate if the upper-income taxpayers who would benefit
most were made to pay elsewhere for the cut. But his House
counterpart, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and
Means Committee, has vowed all-out opposition to a reduction.
   ``This assault on tax reform would be a bad idea no matter what
its deficit impact,'' Rostenkowski said in a statement Thursday.
``Now that we know of its alarming impact on the deficit, I urge the
president to reexamine the proposal,'' he said.
   Rostenkowski's committee lined up behind the chairman Thursday.
The panel by voice voice stated its opposition to any significant
change in the 1986 law. Ending the special benefit for capital gains
was a major portion of the 1986 law.
   In a message to Congress on Feb. 9, Bush said, ``I propose that
we cut the maximum tax rate on capital gains to increase long-term
investment. History is clear: this will increase revenues, help
savings and create new jobs.''
   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks, real
estate and other property, had enjoyed preferential tax treatment
unil passage of the 1986 tax overhaul. Now, capital gains are taxed
just as other income, such as wages and interest, at rates of 15
percent, 28 percent or 33 percent, depending on total income.
   Under Bush's proposal, the maximum capital-gains rate would be
cut to 15 percent for most productive assets; when fully effective
in 1995, the change would apply only to assets held longer than 36
months. A couple with adjusted gross income under $20,000 (or a
single person under $10,000) would pay no tax on such gains,
including the sale of a principal home.
   Bush's tax analysts in the Treasury Department reason that
reducing the tax on capital gains will encourage taxpayers to sell
large quantities of long-term investments, thus boosting the amount
of income subject to taxation. In the long run, they say, the lower
rate will induce greater saving.
   Despite Rostenkowski's opposition, there is considerable support
in both parties in Congress for restoring a preferential tax rate
for capital gains.
   Most of the opposition is based on the fact that almost all the
benefit from the change would go to the richest Americans and that
it would mark the first step toward undoing the big 1986 tax
overhaul.
   According to figures from the Internal Revenue Service, more than
34 percent of the $135 billion of capital gains that were reported
on returns filed in 1987 were recorded by 34,818 taxpayers whose
incomes were over $1 million apiece. Seventy percent of the gain
went to 1.5 million people with incomes over $100,000.

<HEAD>GM Gives Up Trying To Sell Closed Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. says it has given up
trying to sell its closed Fairfield auto parts stamping plant as an
ongoing business and instead will sell the property.
   GM spokeswoman Sharon Hines said Thursday that the automaker
tried but failed to conclude deals with two companies to sell the
factory so that it could continue as a stamping plant. No other
prospective buyers have stepped forward, she said.
   The 1.5 million-square-foot plant employed up to 2,500 workers in
this southwestern Ohio community before it closed six months ago as
part of a consolidation of GM facilities.
   GM plans to transfer some of the Fairfield plant's equipment to
other plants and then sell the property, she said.
   Darrell Bowling, co-director of a GM-United Auto Workers center
formed to help former GM Fairfield workers find new jobs, said GM's
decision was unfair to the 500 to 600 former employees who stayed in
the Fairfield area hoping to get a job when the plant reopened under
new ownership.
   ``There's still some hope that something positive will happen,''
Bowling said. ``But I think GM had this decision in mind a long time
ago. They're just playing games with our people.''
   Ms. Hines said GM plans to work with city officials to find an
alternative use for the plant.
   ``Our effort to find a buyer was probably more extensive than any
we've undertaken at other facilities,'' she said. ``Two years is a
lot of time, but we've had no other offers.''

<HEAD>Banks Hike Prime, Durable Goods Down, Markets Mostly Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A hike in a key bank-lending rate dominated the economic news
Thursday, reflecting stronger inflation-fighting steps by the
federal government and signaling higher borrowing costs for millions
of American consumers.
   The half-percentage point hike in the prime rate by two big New
York banks, Chase Manhattan and Republic National, was the second
increase in two weeks and lifted the rate to 11.5 percent, the
highest level since November 1984.
   The prime is a benchmark for a wide range of business and
consumer loan rates, including car loans and adjustable-rate home
mortgages. An increase in the prime means borrowers will have to pay
more to finance their debts.
   It also reflects the higher cost of borrowing the banks face
themselves, indicating the Federal Reserve is soaking up money in
the banking system, one of its weapons in restraining inflation.
   The prime hike overshadowed another report that suggested the
economy might be slowing, which might have eased fears about
inflation. The Commerce Department said durable-goods factory orders
fell 3 percent in January.
   Chase said it raised the prime rate because its own cost of funds
had risen sharply since the last prime rate hike Feb. 10. Major
banks then boosted the rate to 11 percent from 10.5 percent.
   The prime-rate hike came a day after the Labor Department
reported consumer prices rose in January at an annual rate of 7.2
percent, the highest level in two years. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan
called the inflation trend disturbing and vowed to pressure rates up
until he squeezes inflation out of the economy.
   Fears about inflation and interest rates influenced the financial
markets, although they already had closed by the time the prime-rate
increase was announced.
   On Wall Street stocks recovered only slightly from the day
before, when they tumbled on anxiety about inflation. In the bond
market, a sensitive economic barometer, prices fell because of what
traders called indications that the Fed was tightening credit
further.
   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar slipped over pessimism
about Washington's ability to restrain the U.S. budget and trade
deficits, which have been partly blamed for the currency's
depreciation over the past three years.

<HEAD>Pennwalt Sells Division In Anti-Takeover Strategy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pennwalt Corp. said Thursday it will sell its
Wallace &amp; Tiernan equipment division for more than $40 million as
part of a strategy to avoid a hostile takeover by Centaur Partners.
   The sale was announced two days after Pennwalt rejected Centaur's
$110-a-share offer and announced it would explore other options.
   Wallace &amp; Tiernan, based in Belleville, N.J., is being sold to a
management-led investor group, W&amp;T Acquisition Corp., for about $44
million, Pennwalt spokeswoman Sue Kinnard said.
   Pennwalt Chairman Edwin E. Tuttle said the sale completes a
restructuring program announced last June in which the chemical
company has sold off its pharmaceutical division and most equipment
divisions.
   Pennwalt used part of the money from the sales to buy back stock.
But before the year ended, Centaur bid $100 a share for each of the
6.98 million Pennwalt common shares it doesn't own. Centaur now owns
about 1 million, or 13 percent, of the total shares outstanding.
   Pennwalt refused the initial offer, setting up a bitter battle
for control of the company.
   In rejecting Centaur's offer of $110 Tuesday, Pennwalt authorized
investment banker Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. and company management to look
for alternatives.
   The company declined to comment on how Wallace &amp; Tiernan's sale
may fit into its plans.
   Centaur had no comment on Thursday's sale. The investment group
has pledged to pursue the acquisition.
   Pennwalt closed at $118.87{, up 62.5 cents, in New York Stock
Exchange trading Thursday. Last June, when Centaur first announced
its takeover bid, the stock was trading at about $70.

<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. confirmed
Thursday it has agreed to settle a $100 million lawsuit charging
that its personal computers violated a basic patent on word
processing held by a small Rockville-based company.
   The settlement calls for IBM to acquire the patent held by the
company, Berkeley Limited Partnership, IBM spokeswoman Cynthia
Stevens said. She declined to comment on how much if anything IBM
was paying Berkeley.
   Max Stul Oppenheimer, a Baltimore lawyer not involved in the
case, said it was considered important to software publishers and
other computer businesses nationwide.
   Berkeley had sought more than $100 million in lost royalties from
IBM and an injunction preventing IBM for making or selling personal
computers until the expiration of its patent on Oct. 31, one of its
lawyers, Edward Goldstein of Houston, said last year.
   In a counterclaim that was dismissed before the settlement, IBM
had accused Berkeley of trying to extort money by forcing IBM to
license its technology.
   Berkeley filed its suit in 1987, contending that IBM personal
computers, when they ran word processing software, infringed on its
1972 patent on a word processing device.
   IBM argued that the patent was invalid because the ideas in it
were widely known at the time the patent was issued, and that IBM's
computers worked differently.
   A stipulation on the settlement was signed by U.S. District Judge
Joseph C. Howard in Baltimore last week. The agreement becomes void
if its terms are not completed within 180 days.
   Goldstein, Berkeley's lawyer, said Thursday he could not comment
on the settlement. Arnold D. Berkeley, a Washington lawyer who set
up the company with some other investors, was away from his office
and unavailable for comment, a secretary said.

<HEAD>Stockbroker Charged With Taking Clients' Cash Wrote Of ``Lies And
Deceit''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE H. DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A stockbroker accused of fleeing with millions of
dollars in clients' money wrote that he ``lived in a bowl of lies
and deceit,'' according to an entry from the stockbroker's diary
read in court Thursday.
   The U.S. government has charged former Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
broker Walter F. Curran with $2.6 million in bank fraud and mail
fraud.
   Curran was arrested last week at a U.S.-Canada border crossing
carrying $32,000 in cash, with $100,000 more stuffed in a suitcase
stowed in his car trunk.
   Curran appeared Thursday before U.S. Magistrate Joyce Alexander,
who continued the detention hearing to Friday. U.S. attorneys are
arguing that Curran should be held without bail, while the defense
is seeking his release on $500,000 bail.
   Curran, 46, crossed his arms and lowered his head as prosecutor
Peter Mullin read from a diary seized when the defendant was
arrested.
   ``Everything has finally come to a head. ... There is nothing to
say to justify what I did,'' went the entry for Feb. 8. ``I tried to
capitalize on the use of other people's money. ... I know I will
have to face the consequences.''
   The silver-haired Curran showed little emotion during the all-day
hearing that was attended by friends, family members and attorneys
for his alleged victims.
   Defense attorney Thomas Troy said the diary could weaken his
client's case.
   ``It might be incriminating, but it's there and we're going to
have to talk about it,'' Troy said after the session adjourned.
   In the lengthy diary entry, Curran lamented about the struggle he
had faced since the October 1987 stock market crash and asked
forgiveness from his family for any suffering he had caused.
   The former stockbroker also instructed his former clients to
approach Dean Witter for reimbursement. ``They can claim I
misrepresented their interests,'' the diary said.
   ``I've lived in a bowl of lies and deceit hoping I could resolve
my problems with a miracle,'' Curran wrote. ``I used other people's
money to create a fantasy life and became a prisoner of my own
wishful thinking.''
   Curran was returned late Wednesday to Boston, from which he
allegedly fled last month with millions of dollars in client
investments.
   Executives at the brokerage house's New York headquarters sent
representatives to calm nervous employees after several of Curran's
clients stormed the Boston office Feb. 8 demanding to know his
whereabouts.
   Curran allegedly persuaded the investors to place their money
directly with him on the promise of higher returns.
   The stockbroker's disappearance initially sparked reports that
he'd left the country with as much as $10 million in clients' money
and $475,000 in funds owed the Bank of Boston.
   But Dean Witter spokesman James F. Flynn said Wednesday that $2.3
million was unaccounted for and no further claims were expected.
   Curran has been sued by the Bank of Boston for $260,000 in bad
checks and an unsecured loan.
   Dean Witter representatives on Feb. 9 informed federal
investigators that Curran was missing after he failed to show up for
work, court documents show.
   Federal officials captured Curran a week ago when he attempted to
re-enter the United States at an out-of-the-way town in New York.
   Customs officials alerted authorities after his Canadian rental
car aroused suspicion, and a check of his driver's license revealed
he was wanted in Massachusetts.

<HEAD>Burlington Files Complaint Against Pennzoil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burlington Resources Inc. accused Pennzoil Co. on
Thursday of secret takeover plans and asked a federal court to force
the oil company to sell two-thirds of its Burlington stock.
   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Seattle,
Burlington said Pennzoil violated federal securities laws by
``misstating its intentions with respect to its accumulation of the
company's shares and by concealing that it has violated (disclosure)
rules.''
   The complaint said Pennzoil is trying to take over the
Seattle-based diversified resource and energy company. Burlington
requested that the court force Pennzoil to disclose its intentions.
   The complaint also asked the court to make Pennzoil sell 8
million of its 12 million Burlington shares and temporarily bar
Pennzoil from buying more.
   Houston-based Pennzoil, flush with cash from a $3 billion
court-settlement with Texaco Inc. last year, has said its purchases
of Burlington shares over the past several months were for
investment purposes. Nevertheless, Pennzoil's interest in Burlington
has raised speculation it wanted to buy the company.
   Pennzoil issued a brief statement late Thursday calling
Burlington's suit ``frivolous'' and saying it ``will be dealt with
in due course.''
   On the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, Burlington closed at
$49.62{, up from $47.87{ on Wednesday. Pennzoil closed at $81.37{,
up from $80.75.
   Burlington has indicated it will reject any takeover attempt. In
December the company installed a ``poison pill'' defense designed to
make an unwanted acqusition prohibitively expensive.

<HEAD>From Alleged Condo Conspiracy, Feds Build Far-Reaching Thrift Fraud
Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WENDY E. LANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government witness list has 500 names.
A moving van had to be hired to carry the 4,000 documents to be
entered as evidence.
   One of the most far-reaching thrift fraud cases went to trial
this past week in a Texas federal court, where attorneys began
presenting their accounts of flamboyant developer D.L. ``Danny''
Faulkner and six other defendants accused of bilking S&amp;Ls by
inflating the values of a condominium empire.
   If convicted, the defendants face a total of 1,696 years in
prison and fines of almost $1.5 million.
   It's a case that has resulted in dozens of indictments in related
scams and reflects what many thrift experts call the financial
treachery partly responsible for the S&amp;L crisis nationwide.
   Five government attorneys, six FBI agents and several
secretaries, along with the defendants and their 12 attorneys, have
bivouacked in Lubbock for the fraud, conspiracy and racketeering
trial, expected to last six months.
   As presented by prosecutors during opening statements, Faulkner
and his codefendants saw their condo kingdom crumble with the
collapse of the Empire Savings and Loan Association, plundered by
them to finance swank lifestyles that included Rolls-Royces,
designer wardrobes and posh parties.
   They're accused of conspiring to reap profits from an estimated
$500 million in loans, primarily for condo developments along
Interstate 30 in the Dallas suburb of Garland. The case has become
known as the I-30 Condo trial.
   The 85-page, 88-count indictment issued by a federal grand jury
in October 1987 said Faulkner and codefendants ``recruited and
corruptly rewarded'' heads of lending institutions and real estate
appraisers for their participation.
   According to the indictment, the scheme worked like this: Tracts
of land along I-30, used as collateral for the loans, were inflated
in value through a series of sales known as ``land flips.'' One
parcel of land was sold among Faulkner and codefendants as many as
six times a day. Each time its value was inflated, sometimes as much
as fourfold.
   Then the land was sold in smaller sections to a pre-arranged
buyer. The buyer was paid money up front to sign for a loan that had
already been arranged by the defendants.
   The alleged conspirators got rich illegally, prosecutors say,
from the loan proceeds and from the profits they made selling wildly
inflated property to unsuspecting buyers.
   The indictment describes one land deal where an 82-acre tract was
purchased for 52 cents per square foot by Empire's real estate
subsidiary. When an 18.6-acre tract eventually was sold to a group
of borrowers, the land was assigned values ranging from $8.50-$12
per square foot.
   Faulkner's attorney contends her client was no more than a land
salesman.
   ``Quite simply, Danny Faulkner was the individual who began
condominium development out in Garland and sold the land to other
developers,'' said attorney Cheryl Wattley. ``That was it.''
   Numerous participants in I-30 land deals are expected to testify
in exchange for lighter sentences.
   While the government touts its paper trail, Ms. Wattley said that
won't corroborate the testimony of people ``who have essentially
sold their souls to the government in order to try to get lighter
sentences and compensate for what they have done.''
   Faulkner, 55, is the former owner of a paint contracting company.
He began developing condos along I-30 and investing in savings and
loan associations in the late 1970s.
   In 1979 he was part of a group that bought Empire. Prosecutors
allege he pocketed at least $40 million in loan proceeds, which he
used to bankroll a life of luxury. He owned a Bell Jet Ranger
helicopter and a box at Texas Stadium, but also was known as a
magnanimous giver.
   ``God has blessed me and I like helping people,'' he once said.
``Money isn't important. People are important.''
   The criminal trial was assigned to U.S. District Judge Sam
Cummings in Lubbock after the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered
Judge Joe Fish in Dallas to step down. Fish was related to someone
marginally involved in the case. The defense previously had asked
for a change of location for the trial.

   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan,
saying a separately regulated thrift industry may not be needed in
the future, told Congress on Thursday that the Fed will make it
easier for bank holding companies to buy troubled savings and loans.
   Greenspan, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, also
said the central bank and the Treasury Department have arranged to
support the Federal Home Loan Bank system in the event of runs on
S&amp;Ls.
   Meanwhile, the White House Office of Management and Budget late
Thursday released figures showing the government spending $264.6
billion on S&amp;L problems through the year 2018.
   It breaks down as follows: $52.2 billion to meet commitments in
the rescue of 205 institutions last year, $50 billion to shut down
350 insolvent but still open S&amp;Ls, $73.4 billion to take care of
additional S&amp;Ls slipping into insolvency from 1991 through 2018, and
$89.2 billion in interest payments from 1989 through 2018.
   Even though the outline shows continuing S&amp;L failures in the next
century, it assumes the S&amp;L industry will be basically healthy and
will be paying more than enough deposit insurance premiums to cover
the losses.
   Greenspan's comments came as opposition to President Bush's
333-page S&amp;L proposal grew among members of Congress fighting to
preserve a separate S&amp;L industry.
   At a hearing of the House Banking Committee, Rep. Richard Lehman,
D-Calif., complained that Bush would give banks preference in buying
up S&amp;Ls and turn the oversight and regulation of the thrifts over to
bank regulators.
   ``Rather than heal the wounds, your plan may actually put it (the
S&amp;L industry) out of its misery,'' Lehman told Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady.
   The secretary denied any ``intention on our part to deliver up
the S&amp;L industry to the banking industry.''
   Earlier, Brady had said that S&amp;Ls are an important part of the
nation's commitment to affordable housing and that the
administration plan ``assures the emergence of a healthy and strong
S&amp;L industry.''
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, said Brady's evaluation seems to conflict with comments
by Greenspan, who said the administration's proposal does not
prejudge whether the thrift industry will survive.
   ``My own judgment is that, at the end of the day, thrifts will
look a lot more like banks than they do now, but there will still be
thrifts,'' Greenspan said. ``Ultimately it's going to be the markets
that are going to determine the banking structure in this country.''
   ``Specialized mortgage lenders will exist because they are
profitable ... I don't think it really matters what kind of
institutional structure we put around it,'' he said.
   But Greenspan told the committee he was not saying that ``at this
stage that we should do away with the thrift industry.''
   What will not survive, he said, is a thrift industry that relies
on short-term deposits to fund long-term, fixed-rate mortgages.
   Greenspan said his board ``attaches considerable importance'' to
a planned Treasury Department study of broad questions not addressed
by the Bush plan, such as the future of deposit insurance and of
S&amp;Ls.
   Riegle expressed concern that the study could be an opening ``for
really doing away with the savings and loan industry.'' He said that
when taxpayers pay billions of dollars toward resolving S&amp;L
problems, they will demand assurance the money is being spent on a
system that serves a public purpose.
   Greenspan said it is ``vitally important'' for Congress to ``very
promptly'' enact the president's S&amp;L plan. In the meantime,
Greenspan said the Federal Reserve, as the financial world's lender
of last resort, has entered into a support arrangement with the
Federal Home Loan Bank system, which lends to S&amp;Ls.
   In November and December, a record $15 billion flowed out of the
nation's S&amp;Ls.
   ``We stand ready to make certain the liquidity needs of the
thrift institutions are met,'' Greenspan said.
   Any lending by the Fed would be secured by property from the
borrowing thrift and guaranteed by the Federal Savings and Loan
Insurance Corp., which ensures deposits in S&amp;Ls. Although the FSLIC
is technically insolvent, it's backed by the full faith and credit
of the U.S. government.
   If the Fed is called upon, the Treasury Department would also
participate by lending up to $750 million to the FSLIC under a line
of credit that's been available since the 1930s.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the House
subcommittee with jurisdiction over S&amp;Ls, said he would offer
legislation re-creating an old-fashioned S&amp;L industry. He would
restrict 80 percent of each thrift's future lending to financing
one-to-four-family homes within a 50-mile radius of the institution.
   Brady said the administration opposes that proposal because it
would leave S&amp;Ls too vulnerable to fluctuating interest rates.
   In related topics, Greenspan:
   _Said S&amp;Ls failing to attract more private investment and meet a
6 percent capital level by June 1991 would not be put out of
business. They would, however, be forbidden to grow.
   _Sidestepped an opportunity to crticize the economic assumptions,
including a sharp drop in interest rates and steadily growing
deposits, underlying the Bush S&amp;L plan. Private analysts and members
of Congress have labeled the assumptions as too rosy.
   _Said the president's financing proposal ``should be adequate,''
but conceded ``it's conceivable that there would be the need for a
minor mid-course correction in a year or two.''

<HEAD>Lawyers Of Former Pillsbury Shareholders To Receive About $4 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grand Metropolitan PLC has agreed to pay about
$4 million to lawyers who represented former Pillsbury Co.
shareholders in litigation that played a part in Grand Met's
takeover of the food and restaurant company, a lawyer said Thursday.
   Shareholders' lawyers in the Minnesota lawsuit against Pillsbury
will receive slightly less than $2 million and shareholders' lawyers
in a similar Delaware lawsuit will receive slightly more than $2
million, said Steve Oestreich, who represented shareholders in the
Delaware action.
   ``They (Grand Met) acknowledged that we played a major role in
getting the court'' to agree that Pillsbury's shareholders' rights
plan, or ``poison pill,'' should be invalidated, Oestreich said.
   Johnny Thompson, a spokesman for Pillsbury, said Grand Met had no
comment on the terms of the settlement with the attorneys.
   Grand Met, a British liquor and specialty products conglomerate,
acquired Pillsbury on Dec. 18 for $5.68 billion, or $66 a share. The
agreement capped a 2{-month takeover battle in which Pillsbury
resisted the bid by keeping its ``poison pill'' in place and
proposing to spin off its Burger King subsidiary.
   Two days before the takeover agreement was reached, Justice
William Duffy of the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Del., said he
would issue preliminary injunctions sought by Grand Met and the
shareholders to invalidate the pill and temporarily block the
company's planned spinoff of Burger King.
   Both the pill and spinoff could have made a takeover
prohibitively expensive for Grand Met.
   Judge Thomas Carey in Minneapolis also sided with the
shareholders by agreeing to block the Burger King spinoff, and he
said he would agree with Duffy on the ``poison pill'' removal.
Oestreich said the court action ``paved the way'' for a takeover.
   ``I think the shareholders' rights were well protected,'' said
Charles Zimmerman, a Minneapolis lawyer who was part of the
Minnesota lawsuit against Pillsbury. ``It (the lawsuit) did a great
job for them.''
   The lawsuits were filed to encourage Pillsbury to negotiate with
Grand Met after Pillsbury initially declined to bargain with the
company.
   Zimmerman said none of the settlement money will go to
shareholders.
   If Grand Met had not reached a settlement on fees for the
shareholders' lawyers, it would have been up to Carey and Duffy to
award the money, Oestreich said.

<HEAD>Tyson, ConAgra Told To Tell the Truth In Bid For Holly Farms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's two largest poultry producers
were ordered Thursday to stop spreading false information about each
other in their ``spirited corporate contest'' to acquire Holly Farms
Corp.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Richard E. Robinson issued a
preliminary injunction against both Tyson Foods Inc. of Springdale,
Ark., and ConAgra Inc. of Omaha.
   Tyson is the largest poultry producer in the United States,
ConAgra is second and Holly Farms of Memphis, Tenn., is fourth.
   Tyson and ConAgra officers have accused each other in lawsuits of
issuing false and misleading press releases about their efforts to
acquire Holly Farms.
   Robinson said in a 27-page opinion that both bidding companies
probably would succeed on the merits of their claims against each
other and each would suffer irreparable harm if the other continued
to issue misleading statements.
   ConAgra, which has offered to merge with Holly Farms, launched
the legal battle when it filed a federal lawsuit Jan. 24 asking that
Tyson be prohibited from issuing ``false, misleading, inaccurate or
incomplete'' press releases.
   The company contended that Tyson said in a press release Jan. 20
that the Holly Farms board of directors would accept a Tyson offer
of $63.50 a share for Holly stock when Tyson already knew its offer
had been rejected.
   Tyson said it had no intent to defraud and that it issued a
clarifying press release to correct what it said it perceived to be
an erroneous headline issued by a financial wire service.
   Tyson later filed a countercomplaint contending that ConAgra's
press release of Jan. 24 concerning its merger offer constituted
solicitation of proxies in violation of federal securities laws.
That press release said ``the real value'' of ConAgra's merger
agreement with Holly exceeded $64 a share.
   Robinson said Thursday that Tyson established ``a reasonable
probability'' that it would succeed in proceeding with its claim
that ConAgra violated proxy solicitation rules.
   ``It seems more than coincidental that ConAgra would cite in its
press release a figure exceeding $64 of `real value,' a figure
greater than the well-publicized $63.50 price offered by Tyson,'' he
wrote.
   Robinson said that because of the volatility of market activity
in the wake of inaccurate or misleading disclosures, ``another Tyson
transgression could irreparably hamper ConAgra's efforts at
obtaining a fair chance for shareholder approval of the merger
agreement.''
   Robinson ordered Tyson to refrain from issuing ``any information
which is false, misleading, inaccurate or incomplete'' about Tyson's
proposal to acquire Holly Farms, or about the ConAgra-Holly merger
agreement.
   He also ordered ConAgra not to solicit any more proxies without
first complying with federal securities regulations.
   ConAgra and Holly Farms officials have said their shareholders
will meet late in March to vote on the proposed merger.

   The Senate Armed Services Committee voted
Thursday to recommend rejection of John Tower's nomination as
defense secretary, splitting 11-9 along party lines as it handed
President Bush the first major defeat of his young administration.
   In Tokyo, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
stands by the nomination which the Democratic-controlled Senate
plans to take up next week. ``We now go to the floor'' of the
Senate, Fitzwater declared.
   But Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the committee, opened the
nearly three-hour session saying Tower's ``record of alcohol abuse
cannot be ignored in my view.''
   ``I have searched in vain for several weeks for the point in time
when the nominee himself acknowledged this problem and dealt with it
decisively. The nominee made it very clear that he has never sought
medical assistance for his drinking problem,'' said Nunn at a
session that included an open discussion of Tower's drinking habits.
   Fitzwater said the committee had ``every right to look into''
allegations which included reports of heavy drinking and womanizing.
But Fitzwater also complained, ``We hear vague talk about concern
about his personal habits and we think this debate ought to be on a
slightly higher level than that.''
   If the full Senate should turn down Tower, a former senator who
used to chair the Armed Services panel, it would be the first time
in history a newly elected president had suffered a rejection of a
nominee to his first Cabinet. In all, eight Cabinet nominations have
been rejected, the most recent 30 years ago.
   Tower, in a statement, said he was ``obviously disappointed with
the outcome of the Senate Armed Services Committee vote.'' But the
statement said Tower will continue to work at the Pentagon ``and
await the vote of full Senate on his confirmation.''
   But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., urged Bush to withdraw the
nomination before a full Senate decision.
   ``It doesn't do the nominee any good. It doesn't do the president
any good,'' Byrd said. ``It's a tremendous burden for any nominee to
go to the floor with a vote of no confidence.''
   Fred McClure, the White House liasion to Congress, attended the
committee vote and said the president told him prior to the panel's
action, ``just hang in there and I'll be back Monday.''
   Nunn opened the lengthy session by noting that in last year's
presidential campaign, Bush spoke about putting ``ethics at the
center of his agenda and promised that higher standards would be
required when he took office.''
   He said the committee also took the same steps to ensure high
ethical standards, sending a letter to Bush and former Democratic
presidential candidate Michael Dukakis stressing the need for
quality nominees.
   Tower, according to Nunn, failed to meet that standard.
   ``I cannot in good conscience vote to put an individual at the
top of the chain of command when his history of excessive drinking
is such that he would not be selected to command a missile wing, a
SAC bomber squadron or a Trident missile submarine,'' Nunn said.
   On the other side, John Warner of Virginia, the committee's
top-ranking Republican, said the allegations amounted only to a
``cobweb of fiction and fantasy,'' and said he supported the
nomination.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said, ``This committee ought to have
the courage to do what is right.'' He shouted, ``Perception should
not control this committee ... it ought to be the truth.''
   Other Republicans on the panel alleged partisanship by their
colleagues and suggested that Tower was being held to too high a
standard. ``The majority believes we are confirming a defense god,
not a defense secretary,'' said Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.
   Added Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.: ``This is not a canonization.''
   Following the vote, GOP Sens. John McCain of Arizona and William
Cohen of Maine indicated that the panel's decision might create
serious partisanship problems in the future.
   ``This is going to make it much more difficult to put together a
bipartisan coalition for defense and foreign policy ... I think it's
going to be very damaging to the committee, the bruises deep and
long lasting,'' said Cohen. ``The emotions have been building on
this. I think it's a bad storm rising.''
   McCain said the vote signals ``an incredible increase in
partisanship. John Tower had a lot of friends on our side, and they
think he's been very badly treated.''
   As sentiment against Tower mounted, White House concerns
increased, sending Vice President Dan Quayle and other
representatives into high-gear lobbying.
   From Tokyo, the traveling White House kept tabs on the situation
by telephone, calling committee members and the GOP leadership, said
a White House source speaking on condition of anonymity.
   During the afternoon, the panel met for more than two hours in
closed-door session, then broke up briefly so Democrats and
Republicans could caucus separately.
   Tower has been dogged by allegations of excessive drinking and
womanizing as well as questions stemming from his consulting work
for defense contractors before his nomination. Even his closest
supporters concede he had a drinking problem in the 1970s, but they
say it no longer exists.
   One Democratic senator, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the FBI report contains material concerning an airplane flight from
London to Dallas in which at least one witness reported seeing Tower
drunk. But FBI invetigators were told by an unnamed flight attendant
aboard the flight that Tower was not drunk at the time.
   The panel had sought additional material from the White House, as
well as a transcript of a separate investigation by a House
subcommittee looking into alleged security lapses in an arms control
delegation in Geneva that included Tower in the mid-1980s.
   Prior to the vote, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
delivered an emotional appeal to his colleagues, saying the
nomination is a ``matter of minute-by-minute concern'' to Bush.
   ``This is his nominee. He didn't pick John Tower up off the
street. He didn't do it without careful consideration,'' Dole said
in a speech in the Senate chamber.
   The committee members who voted for the motion were Sens. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga.; James Exon, D-Neb.; Carl Levin, D-Mich.; Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.; Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.; Alan Dixon, D-Ill.; John Glenn,
D-Ohio; Al Gore, D-Tenn.; Tim Wirth, D-Colo.; James Shelby, D-Ala.;
and Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   The Republicans who voted against the motion were John Warner of
Virginia, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, William Cohen of Maine,
Pete Wilson of California, John McCain of Arizona, Malcolm Wallop of
Wyoming, Slade Gorton of Washington, Trent Lott of Mississippi and
Dan Coats of Indiana.
