   President Bush eased economic sanctions
against China on Tuesday as Secretary of State James A. Baker III
expressed ``regrets'' he may have misled Americans about high-level
U.S. contacts with Beijing.
   The White House announced that Bush had approved the export of
three communications satellites to be launched by China, and had
ended a prohibition on the Export-Import Bank providing help to
companies doing business in China.
   The president's actions came as Baker said through a spokeswoman
he regretted that in a recent television interview, he may have
misled the public about the two trips to China by high-level U.S.
officials.
   Whether the administration was misleading the public prompted
close questioning of White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who
mounted a vigorous defense of President Bush's secret contact with
the Chinese leadership.
   The furor erupted after it was learned Monday that national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger had visited Beijing in secret in July, in
addition to their previously disclosed trip earlier this month.
   Bush notified Congress that he was exempting the three
communications satellites, which are being built or renovated by
the Hughes Aircraft Co., from economic sanctions imposed on China
after last June's crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Hughes is selling
the satellites to firms in Australia and Hong Kong for launch on a
Chinese rocket.
   ``The sale of these satellites represents approximately $300
million worth of business for U.S. firms,'' said a statement by
Fitzwater.
   The statement said the move was ``consistent with the
president's expressed determination, in imposing sanctions last
June, to maintain commercial relations with China.''
   The July trip came at a time when the administration said
high-level visits to Beijing were banned because of the violent
suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in June.
   Baker, appearing on ABC-TV Dec. 10, called the December trip by
Scowcroft and Eagleburger ``the first time we've had high-level
U.S. officials go to the People's Republic of China.'' Baker noted
he himself had publicly met high Chinese officials in other
countries.
   Asked about the apparent discrepancy, spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler said Tuesday that Baker ``felt obligated to protect the
secrecy of a mission that the President wished to have classified.
He regrets that me may have misled some.''
   She added: ``He felt that by acknowledging his own direct
involvement it was sufficient to make the point that this (December
trip) was not the first case of high-level contact.''
   Before that statement, she had said Baker did not feel he had
lied.
   On the satellites, the White House statement said, ``Approval of
these licences is in keeping with the president's policy not to
disrupt normal commercial relations with China.''
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., called Bush's approval ``a true
outrage'' and ``another effort to curry favor with the hardliners
in Beijing and an insult to the memory of those who died for
democracy in Tiananmen Square.''
   Gore sponsored the legislation that forbids the launch of
U.S.-manufacturered satellites Chinese rockets unless the president
declares it to be in the U.S. national interest, as Bush has done.
   Before the satellite announcement, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
said Bush's sending of high-level emissaries to China after the
violent Chinese crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators ``makes
the president look like a wimp in Beijing and a hypocrite in
Washington.'' His comments were in a statement issued while he was
traveling in Nepal.
   Facing criticism from members of Congress that the
administration has been too friendly with China in the aftermath of
the June crackdown, the White House issued a separate two-page
``justification'' of the satellite action.
   ``After launch, they will be controlled for civil use,'' the
White House statement said. ``It is in the national interest of the
United States to approve export licernses for the three satellites
currently being prepared for launch in China.''
   Two of the satellites are being built by Hughes Aircraft Co. for
AUSSAT, an Australian company. The other one is being refurbished
by Hughes for AsiaSat, based in Hong Kong.
   The White House also cited ``national interest'' in waiving
restrictions on the Export-Import bank's financing of U.S. business
activities within China.
   The bank is a government agency which helps provide a range of
assistance to U.S. companies, including low-interest loans, to help
them set up overseas operations.
   The White House said the waiver ``preserves a level playing
field for U.S. business. Additional business activity with China
will be considered on a case-by-case basis as part of a continuing
review process.''
   Fitzwater, under close questioning by reporters, declared Bush
had not misled Americans, as critics contended.
   ``It is not misleading to not tell you about everything he's
doing,'' Fitzwater said.
   At the State Department's daily briefing, Tutwiler was asked
whether she felt the American public had been misled on U.S. policy
toward China.
   ``I certainly don't think that I've lied,'' she said. ``I know
Marlin doesn't think that he's lied. Secretary (of State James A.)
Baker doesn't think he's lied and the president doesn't think he's
lied.''
   Fitzwater said he could not comment on whether there had been
other trips to China that still remained secret.
   But he said, ``There have been trips you don't know about. There
will be more.''
   Fitzwater said Bush dispatched Scowcroft and Eagleburger in July
to make sure that China's hard-line leaders knew the seriousness of
U.S. anger over the crushing of the pro-democracy demonstrations.
   He said it was important to keep the trip secret so the Chinese
knew that denunciations of the crackdown were more than public
posturing.
   Denying that the administration had violated its own ban on
exchanges with China, Fitzwater said there never was any intention
to cut off all high-level contact. He said there was a distinction
between high-level ``exchanges'' and high-level ``contacts.''

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz has cancer,
according to a televised report.
   Goetz, 41, said in papers filed in State Supreme Court in the
Bronx that he has been unable to appear in court because he had
major surgery last month and is undergoing radiation treatments,
WNBC-TV reported Monday.
   The report did not say what type of cancer Goetz has or how
serious it is.
   Goetz, who is white, became a symbol of New York City's racial
tensions after he shot four black youths in a subway on Dec. 22,
1984.
   Goetz claimed the four were trying to rob him; the youths said
they were panhandling for change to play videogames.
   Darrell Cabey, one of the teen-agers shot by Goetz, has filed a
$50 million lawsuit against the gunman. Cabey is paralyzed from the
waist down from the shooting.
   Goetz was convicted of illegal gun possession and acquitted of
attempted murder and assault in 1987.

   Milton Halverson has sent the same
birthday card to his longtime pal Arleen Carlson for 50 years.
   And she sends it right back.
   Mended over the years by strips of transparent tape now yellow
and brittle, the card is the kind that could put a greeting card
company out of business.
   Known as a ``thrifty card,'' it features a piece of glazed paper
on which the giver writes his or her name in pencil. The idea is
explained in a Scottish verse inside that ends, ``Ye can just wash
off my name, write in your own ye see. Then when my birthday comes
around, ye can send it back tae me.''
   ``And that's what we've been doing for the past 50 years,'' said
Halverson, who on Monday mailed the card for the 100th time.
   Carlson, who turns 72 on Saturday, has been friends with
Halverson since the two grew up together in Amery, Wis., where
Carlson still lives.
   She remembers buying the card in an Amery drugstore for 5 cents,
and mailing it for 2 cents. Halverson first received the card when
he was 10.
   ``I even received this (in Germany) when I was in the Army,''
the 59-year-old telephone repairman said. ``And I'd fire it right
back.''
   They'll keep firing away, too.
   ``I wouldn't want a new card. That would take all the fun out of
it,'' Halverson said.

   Last-minute Christmas shoppers, if
you're looking to splurge there's something big on the market: two
entire villages.
   New Hanover and Arnsberg, replicas of 19th-century European
villages built in the Black Forest in southeastern Missouri, are
for sale.
   The villages, which are unincorporated and uninhabited, were
built by the late Burton Gerhardt as a tribute to the early German
settlement of the area.
   In September, they were sold for $493,500 to East Perry Lumber
Co., along with the 1,041-acre forest. Company officials don't want
the 29 quaint buildings, the covered bridge or the 600 feet of
railroad track. They only want the trees.
   ``We don't want to get into the tourist business and it is too
nice just to sit idle,'' said Sonny Lueders, East Perry's
secretary-treasurer.
   The company has received about 10 inquiries but no offers since
the towns went up for sale. Lueders isn't revealing the asking
price.

   ``I'm very careful,'' she said Monday. ``Dignity is a very
important criterion in the pageant.''
   She won her state title two months ago, entering as Ms. Senior
Steel Valley under the sponsorship of a company that operates
senior citizen centers in southwestern Pennsylvania. Forty-four
friends traveled to the pageant and rang cowbells in support.
   The former ninth-grade science teacher begins her dance in a
blue gown. She then pops behind a screen and comes out modestly
wrapped in a yellow towel. When daintily dropped, a fringed black

   She never undresses to a ``itsy bitsy'' bikini, however.
Underneath she wears a full-length beige leotard.

   A manufacturing mistake has struck a sour note
with the Dallas Symphony Orchestra.
   The producer of compact discs for the Pro Arts record company
mislabeled up to 1,000 compact discs, according to the orchestra's
music administrator, Victor Marshall.
   ``I found out about it when members of the orchestra bought the
recording of Gustav Holst's `The Planets' to see how they sounded
and discovered that they had bought a Christian rock group album,''
said Marshall.
   Many of the discs have been recalled, but Marshall said he still
has 50 of them.
   ``I don't even know who the rock group is, but I don't really
want to throw the discs away,'' Marshall said. ``I may string them
on a wire and turn them into a mobile for my office.''

   A lawyer was killed when a mail bomb
exploded in his office Monday, and federal agents said there were
``strong similarities'' to the mail bomb found at an Atlanta
courthouse and the mail bomb killing death of a federal judge in
Alabama.
   Robert Robinson, a city alderman and civil rights activist, died
of his wounds at 8:25 p.m. while undergoing surgery at Memorial
Medical Center about 3{ hours after the 5 p.m. bomb blast, said
hospital spokesman Michael Rowan.
   ``He lost his right arm, his left hand and some upper body
tissue and (suffered) severe damage to his legs,'' fellow alderman
Floyd Adams said earlier.
   Robinson was not able to communicate with doctors when he was
brought in to the hospital after the blast around 5 p.m., said
Jeryl Davis, another hospital spokesman.
   A mail bomb killed 11th U.S. Circuit of Appeals Judge Robert
Vance in Mountain Brook, Ala., on Saturday. Earlier Monday, a bomb
mailed to the 11th Circuit in Atlanta was discovered and removed
safely.
   At a news conference late Monday, FBI Special Agent Bob DeLoach
said it was ``definitely a possibility'' that white supremacists
sent the bomb that killed Robinson.
   DeLoach and Special Agent William Hinshaw said the FBI is
warning lawyers, judges and NAACP activists in Georgia and Alabama
to beware of strange packages.
   Hinshaw also said the FBI has warned the NAACP that the attacks
apparently are related to the Aug. 22, 1989, tear-gas bomb mailed
to NAACP's Atlanta offices, in which eight people, including a
4-month old child, were injured.
   Postal Inspector John Paul confirmed that the Postal Service is
investigating the Robinson slaying as well as Vance's because
Robinson was killed by a bomb that was in a package mailed to his
office.
   Police told the mayor's office that Robinson had ``received a
package, similar to what's been happening in Atlanta and
Birmingham,'' said Clerk of Council Dyanne Reese.
   ``The preliminary investigation indicates strong similarities to
the other explosive devices,'' FBI Agent Tom Moore said in
Birmingham, Ala., where authorities were investigating Vance's
assassination.
   ``The explosive and incendiary device experts from the FBI and
postal authorities who were in Birmingham yesterday and in Atlanta
today are being flown into Savannah,'' Moore said.
   Robinson represented the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People in a long-running desegregation case
against the Savannah school system, said state Rep. Jim Pannell of
Savannah.
   Pannell, who attended the University of Georgia Law School with
Robinson, said Robinson was one of the first black students to
attend Savannah High School in the 1960s.
   He said Robinson handled many criminal defense and personal
injury cases, but he said he could not recall any which would have
supplied a motive for the bombing.

   ``National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'' was
the nation's No. 1 movie last weekend, displacing the dark comedy
``The War of the Roses.''
   ``She-Devil,'' teaming TV's Roseanne Barr and Oscar winner Meryl
Streep, fell from fourth to out of the Top 10, and the Eddie
Murphy-Richard Pryor collaboration ``Harlem Nights'' dropped from
sixth to 10th place.
   Warner Bros.' ``Christmas Vacation,'' starring Chevy Chase,
moved up from second on a $7.23 million return last weekend while
``The War of the Roses,'' with Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas
as dueling spouses, slipped to No. 2.
   ``Back to the Future Part II'' was third. The film has collected
$75.5 million since Thanksgiving weekend.
   Disney's animated feature ``The Little Mermaid'' was fourth and
``The Wizard,'' starring TV's young Fred Savage as a video game
whiz, opened at No. 5.
   ``Family Business,'' starring Dustin Hoffman, Sean Connery and
Matthew Broderick, had a disappointing debut, earning $2.1 million
and finishing sixth.
   Finishing seventh was the all-star ensemble ``Steel Magnolias,''
and the pairing of two other big stars, Robert DeNiro and Sean
Penn, produced an eighth-place debut for ``We're No Angels.''
   The Paul Newman-starring ``Blaze,'' the story of Louisiana Gov.
Earl Long's love affair with stripper Blaze Starr, opened at No. 9
with $1.7 million.
   Joining ``She-Devil'' in the drop from the Top 10 were ``Look

   Martin Marietta Corp. will try again
tonight to conduct the thrice-delayed launch its first commerical
Titan 3 rocket with British and Japanese communications satellites.
   The flight was scrubbed Monday night just five minutes before
the planned liftoff when weather balloon data indicated winds
27,000 feet above the launch area were too strong.
   ``The winds aloft are not acceptable,'' launch commentator Bob
Gordon said in announcing the postponement.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:20 p.m. tonight. It was
postponed twice earlier this month by weather and technical
problems.
   The Titan 3 is to boost into orbit communications satellites for
a Japanese company and the British Ministry of Defense.
   The Japanese Communications Satellite Co. and the British
government are sharing the $125 million cost of the rocket and
launch services provided by Martin Marietta.

   Heeding the warnings of two senators, the U.S.
Customs Service says it won't buy a third high-tech radar plane
until the two existing problem-plagued aircraft can locate and
track airborne drug smugglers.
   In a letter released Monday the Customs Service acknowledged,
however, that the computerized radar systems in the P3 Airborne
Early Warning aircraft won't be fixed until June _ half a year
after the most recent estimate.
   The planes are the government's frontline response to
intercepting drug flights, which carried an estimated 51 percent of
the cocaine seized during 1988 to the United States.
   The Associated Press reported in November that the radar systems
experienced problems since the moment the first plane arrived in
June 1988 at the Customs Service Surveillance Support Center in
Corpus Christi, Texas.
   Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Pete Domenici, R-N.M., wrote to
the agency Nov. 12, saying a third plane should not be ordered
``until the two ... aircraft currently being operated ... meet the
overall aircraft performance standards originally intended...''
   DeConcini is chairman and Domenici the ranking minority member
of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that controls the Customs
Service budget. The planes are made by Lockheed Aeronautical
Systems Co., which predicted in November the problems should be
corrected around the end of this year.
   The first-of-their-kind planes were designed to find and track
smuggler aircraft and guide government interceptors chasing the
drug pilots _ but internal agency documents revealed that computer
failures severely hampered this mission. However, the planes have
continued flying while the Customs Service attempted to fix the
problems.
   In response to the senators, William Rosenblatt, the Customs
Service assistant commissioner for enforcement, wrote, ``We will
not enter into a contractual agreement for the third aircraft until
such time as ... we are entirely satisfied that the originally
intended performance standards are met'' and until the senators
give their approval.
   Rosenblatt's letter was written last week and released to the AP
Monday by DeConcini. The senator, a strong advocate of the
airplanes, said in a statement that he's satisfied the Customs
Service ``has responded in a responsible manner'' and has
``established a schedule to rectify the deficiencies.''
   ``I am satisfied,'' he said, that the agency is insuring ``the
viability of the air interdiction program while insisting that the
contractor live up to the terms of the contract.''
   The first P3 AEW cost $27 million and the second was bought for
$30.6 million. If the third plane is ordered, it would be expected
in 1992.
   ``Everyone was being a little optimistic'' in estimates that the
problems would be fixed by the end of this year, agency spokesman
Dick Weart said Monday. ``Extensive testing'' by Lockheed will take
longer than anticipated, he said.
   Rosenblatt said the agency is withholding $1.5 million from
Lockheed until the detection system is fixed and until the company
also replaces the cockpit windshields _ a separate problem that has
hampered pilot visibility.
   Rosenblatt said Lockheed is attempting to fix:
   _The ``tracker'' which automatically provides computer displays
on a target's course, speed and altitude. Radar operators have
complained the readings are so inaccurate that they can't
effectively guide Customs Service interceptors to a smuggler
aircraft. Some crewmen said they worried they could direct their
interceptors into a collision with a smuggler aircraft.
   _The system used by the P3 AEW planes to ``interrogate'' the
transponder signals of other aircraft to determine their
identification and location. The P3 interrogation signal is so
powerful that planes that may be 300 miles away appear on computer
screens as nearby targets.
   _The special windshields, built to prevent magnetic interference
from the radar. The windshields originally installed have
interfered with pilot visibility.

<HEAD>Space Shuttle Delay Sets up Heavy 1990 Launch Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD BENEDICT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The delay of Columbia's satellite
rescue mission until after the holidays sets up 10 space shuttle
flights in 1990, NASA's heaviest schedule ever.
   ``Columbia is essentially ready to fly, so if we get it off
early next year, we don't believe there will be any added pressure
on the rest of the schedule,'' Kennedy Space Center Director
Forrest S. McCartney said Monday after the postponement was
announced.
   The launch had been scheduled for Thursday but was put off until
Jan. 8 to allow more time to correct launch pad problems and to let
most of the center's 16,000 workers go home for the holidays.
   The most shuttle flights conducted in one year was nine, in
1985, before the 1986 Challenger explosion that grounded the
program for 32 months.
   Two missions were flown in 1988. There were five this year as
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has been
gradually building toward 12 a year by 1992.
   Shuttle managers decided to postpone Columbia's liftoff after
assessing progress on lagging work at renovated pad 39A, which has
not been used since before the Challenger accident. A series of pad
problems, mainly with the fueling systems, caused two previous
short postponements of the mission, which is to deploy one
satellite and retrieve another that is falling to Earth.
   ``The team worked very hard to get Columbia off before
Christmas, but the added work of going off a refurbished launch pad
and a new mobile launch platform really slowed us down,'' said
William B. Lenoir, NASA's associate administrator for space flight.
   The long delay also will enable the agency to essentially shut
down the center as it usually does the last week of each year to
allow employees to take long-planned vacations and to permit an
annual electrical power shutdown so that aging computer and other
systems and components can be overhauled.
   A launch attempt next week would have cost NASA considerable
overtime pay and would have pushed off the power shutdown to 1990,
possibly disrupting work on other shuttle flights.
   ``The launch crews have worked hard this year, and they have
earned a Christmas vacation,'' McCartney said.
   Astronaut Dan Brandenstein, who will command Columbia, said he
and his crew were disappointed about the delay, ``but we are happy
to know we will be spending Christmas with our loved ones. ...
We'll get a good running start at launch after the holidays, and we
can't think of a better way to start a promising new decade.''
   The five astronauts are to spend 10 days in space. They will
release a Navy communications satellite and then track down and
recover the science satellite, a 21,400-pound laboratory that has
orbited the globe nearly six years.
   Columbia's launch is not as urgent as it once was. A few months
ago, it was believed that the science satellite the astronauts will
retrieve, the Long Duration Exposure Facility, would fall back to
Earth in January. That estimate later was revised to mid-February
and just last week to mid-March.

<HEAD>Consumers Want Ready-Made Meals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women in the work force and the popularity of
microwave ovens are pressuring the food industry to convert farm
products not just to food, but to ready-made meals, says an
agriculture publication.
   ``Retailers, distributors and processors are the first to be
buffeted by changes in consumer demands,'' says the article in
``Choices'' written by Benjamin Senauer, University of Minnesota
professor of agriculture and applied economics.
   ``But in many cases these consumer-driven changes work their way
through the food system back to the farmer.''
   Senauer points out that consumers got so hot for oat products,
which are supposed to reduce cholesterol, that farmers couldn't
keep up, leading food processors to turn to imports.
   ``Women in the labor force jumped from 35 percent in 1960 to 55
percent in 1987,'' says the author. ``For married women 35-44 years
old, it doubled from 36 percent to 72 percent during the same
period.''
   Some 75 percent of American households own microwave ovens and
over 60 percent of all the workers in the United States have access
to a microwave on the job, he said.
   These statistics have contributed to a new category of eater
that one food company calls the ``Chase and Grabbits,'' also known
as yuppies, considered 26 percent of the market.
   Other categories into which the Pillsbury Co., according to
Senauer, put consumers and the share of the market they hold are:
   _Functional Feeders, 18 percent, older couple with husband in
blue-collar job, interested in traditional meals in convenient ways.
   _Down Home Stokers, 21 percent, lower income, traditional
regional or ethnic eaters.
   _Careful Cooks, 20 percent, better educated, older, frequently
retired, higher income, want a healthy, nutritious diet with
emphasis on enjoyment.
   _Happy Cookers, 15 percent, a couple in which one or both enjoy
cooking or baking, want basic ingredients and will pay for quality.
   The Happy Cookers and Chase and Grabbits are the growing
segments of the market, says Senauer.
   Another food trend that affects farmers more directly is the
movement away from products sprayed with chemicals toward
organically grown fruits and vegetables.
   Senauer cites a 1989 survey by the Food Marketing Institute that
said 82 percent of the consumers who responded rated pesticides and
herbicide residues as a serious health hazard.
   However, 81 percent said they were completely confident or
mostly confident that the food in grocery stores is safe.
   Senauer said that to avoid consumer panic that can hurt farmers
and food-related businesses, the government and food industry
``both need to be sensitive to the public's need for adequate and
accurate information about the safety of food and thereby actively
work to maintain consumer confidence in the food system.''
   Besides worrying about chemicals, consumers are more concerned
than ever about the nutritional value of their food.
   ``The average American consumes 37 percent of his or her
calories in the form of fat, down from 40 percent in 1977,'' said
Senauer.
   This shows up on the farm in decreased demand for products high
in saturated fat, such as animal shortening, butter and whole milk.
   More cuts can be expected if Americans ever get to the
recommended 30 percent fat content in their daily diet, said
Senauer.

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as
of Dec. 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 8.13 million head,
up 2 percent from a year ago but 3 percent below the level of two
years ago, says the Agriculture Department.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in November totaled 1.50 million
head, fractionally below a year ago but 1 percent below two years
ago, according to the report Monday.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported at 1.99 million head, up 18 percent from a year
ago and 22 percent more than two years ago.
   This was the largest November placement total since 1977, and
the result of cattle moving into feedlots rather than going onto
wheat pastures.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states, which account for about three-fourths of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Dec.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   Americans smoked less in 1989 than the year
before, according to a tobacco report from the Agriculture
Department.
   ``Despite record exports of about 130 billion cigarettes, output
is down,'' said the report released Monday by the department's
economic research service.
   U.S. cigarette consumption may be off about 4 percent from last
year, the report said.
   ``Use of cigars and smoking tobacco continues to decline, but
snuff production is up,'' it also said.
   The Agriculture Department says the U.S. tobacco crop is larger
this year than last, but 1989-90 supplies are lower because of
smaller beginning stocks.

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   GEOGRAPHY _ Romania covers 91,700 square miles and shares
borders with Hungary, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union and Bulgaria.
The Danube River empties into the Black Sea on Romania's eastern
coast. The north of the country is dominated by the Carpathian
mountains and the center by the Transylvanian alps.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Romania's population of 23 million includes about
1.7 million ethnic Hungarians _ the largest minority _ and 220,000
ethnic Germans. Romanian is the main language, but Hungarian,
Serbian, German and Turkish are also spoken. Eighty percent of the
population is Romanian Orthodox and 10 percent are Catholics. There
also are 21,000 Jews.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ECONOMY _ Romania, whose industry accounts for around 60 percent
of the gross national product, exports machinery, metals, lumber,
refined fuels and textiles. Agricultural products include corn,
wheat, potatoes and beets. Natural resources include oil, natural
gas and coal.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ Romania gained independence in 1877 after some five
centuries of Ottoman rule. A monarchy before World War II, the
country was reorganized along Fascist lines from 1940 until August
23, 1944, when Romania switched to the Allied side. With the
support of Soviet troops, a Communist-dominated government bloc won
elections in 1946, and in 1955 Romania joined the Warsaw Pact.

<TEXT>
   LEADERSHIP _ The present leader, Nicolae Ceausescu, came to
power in 1965. Noted for his moderately independent foreign policy
in the 1960s and 1970s, he is under increasing fire for his home
policy, including suppression of dissent and alleged discrimination
against the Hungarian minority. Efforts to repay the foreign debt
quickly have led to growing domestic food and energy shortages in
recent years. Ceausescu's ringing rejection of reform is leaving
him with fewer friends, as Warsaw Pact allies move toward democracy
and Western countries step up criticism of Romania's human rights
records.

<HEAD>Government Knew of Health Risks to Nuclear Plant Workers, Report
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government had clear evidence shortly
after the first nuclear bombs were built in the 1940s that weapons
workers were being exposed to potentially dangerous amounts of
radiation, according to a congressional report.
   Despite this information, including some not previously made
public, officials overseeing the bomb factories recommended not
informing workers of the possible health risks they faced at the
secretly operated facilities, the report said.
   ``The U.S. nuclear weapons program was exposing large numbers of
workers to potentially dangerous health risks but did nothing to
warn them,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, in releasing the report
on Monday.
   The report was prepared by the majority staff of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which Glenn chairs. The panel is
investigating the health research programs of the Energy
Department, which owns the 17 major facilities that design and make
nuclear arms.
   More than 600,000 people have worked at the weapons plants over
the past 45 years.
   The report focused mainly on the period 1947-54 when the Atomic
Energy Commission, the predecessor to the Energy Department, was
rapidly expanding nuclear arms production amid deep suspicions
about Soviet and other foreign development of the bomb.
   Records of an October 1948 meeting of an AEC advisory committee
indicated that enough was known then about releases of radiation at
the Hanford plutonium plant near Richland, Wash., to raise concern
about workers' health. Yet it was decided at the meeting not to
recommend closing Hanford temporarily while action was taken to
stop the release of plutonium particles into the air.
   Despite the concerns about health dangers, ``a counter-balancing
concern was the perceived need, fueled by Cold War fears, to
continue plutonium production because of the relatively small size
of the U.S. nuclear arsenal in 1948,'' the report said.
   The report quoted a committee report from the October 1948
meeting as saying, ``there is no scientific evidence that it is an
unwarranted hazard to continue the present process for six weeks,
during which steps will be taken vigorously to control the
hazard.'' The control measures apparently were not fully successful.
   In December 1948, the manager of the federal Oak Ridge weapons
plant in Tennessee recommended to the AEC's advisory committee that
workers who quit the weapons program be told if they had exceeded
radiation exposure limits, the report said. The manager also
recommended providing medical aid if a former worker developed a
radiation-related illness.
   The advisory panel rejected the recommendations, the report
said. Instead it recommended to the AEC that ``a terminating
employee should be advised at the exit interview as to the care
that the AEC utilizes in protecting each employee.''
   The documents uncovered by the Glenn committee indicated that a
major concern at the Hanford facility was the release of huge
numbers of plutonium particles. The problem, dating at least to
1947, was traced to corroded fan-duct work in the stacks of two
plutonium chemical separations plants.
   A March 1948 report by Dr. Herbert M. Parker, director of the
Hanford health instruments department of General Electric Co.,
which ran the facility for the government, said an average of about
7.4 billion particles were being released from the two plants each
month.
   Parker wrote that ``the critical hazard is to the inhalation and
lung retention of particles,'' which he said ``can produce
radiation damage.'' At the time it was estimated that a worker
could be inhaling about 16 radioactive particles per month.
   This suggests that over a one-year period a worker could have
inhaled an amount of plutonium that is more than twice the current
official lifetime lung burden allowed for Energy Department
workers, the Glenn report said.

<HEAD>Rabin Says He Authorized Meetings Between POW Families, PLO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin says he
authorized meetings between the families of Israeli soldiers
missing in action in Lebanon and PLO leaders in Tunisia.
   Negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization have
been authorized for the families of three soldiers missing since
the battle with Syrian forces at Sultan Yaakoub in eastern Lebanon
on June 11, 1982, during Israel's invasion of Lebanon, Rabin said
Monday.
   ``I have allowed the families to meet with the PLO, and to some
family members even to travel to Tunisia,'' Rabin said.
   ``To get information, family members may hold meetings without
any reservations or limitations, and with our financing,'' Rabin
added, speaking to students at Tel Aviv University.
   Israel officially considers the PLO to be a terrorist group and
refuses to let it participate in the Middle East peace process.
   The three soldiers missing since the Sultan Yaakoub battle are
Sgt. Zvi Feldman, U.S.-born Sgt. Zachary Baumel and Cpl. Yehuda
Katz.
   Israel Television and reliable sources said Baumel's father,
Yona, traveled to Tunisia twice in January, meeting with senior PLO
officials at the organization's headquarters in Tunis. There were
no positive results.
   Rabin said another Israeli soldier, Samir Assad, who disappeared
in 1982 in Lebanon, ``was kidnapped and apparently killed.''
   In 1986, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine
offered to exchange Assad's body for 50 captive guerrillas. Israel
has turned down the offer.
   Two other Israeli soldiers, Yosef Fink and Rachamim Alsheikh,
were kidnapped in southern Lebanon in February 1986.
   Rabin spoke a day after the wife of an Israeli airman captured
three years ago in Lebanon said Israeli authorities told her that
her husband, Ron Arad, was still alive and being held by Iranians.
   The statement over Israeli radio stations was intended to be a
public message to the Iranians ``who have control over those who
are holding Ron Arad,'' said Defense Ministry adviser on prisoners
of war, Uri Slonim.
   Arad, a navigator, was shot down with an F-4 Phantom fighter jet
during an Israeli bombing mission in southern Lebanon on Oct. 16,
1986. The plane's pilot was rescued by Israeli troops.

<HEAD>Survey: White Students More Likely Than Blacks to Use Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White students are more likely than black
students to use all kinds of drugs _ from liquor to cocaine and
hallucinogens _ according to a nationwide survey of drug use by
sixth to 12th grade students.
   ``For all too long, this problem has been portrayed as a black
problem, and I think the end result has been that there are some
people who have not really cared a lot about it because of that,''
said Judge Reggie Walton, associate director of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy.
   ``This is an American problem, not just a black problem, and all
of us have to get on with the business of dealing with this
problem, because I believe that if we do that, that we can, in
fact, prevail,'' Walton said.
   The figures from the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug
Education Inc. were released Monday.
   Fifteen percent of the 58,898 black students surveyed nationwide
said cocaine was ``very easy to get,'' compared with 8 percent of
the 296,180 white students surveyed, according to the PRIDE results.
   However, totals for cocaine use _ and for use of liquor,
marijuana, hallucinogens and stimulants as well _ in junior high
schools, senior high schools and the senior year of high school
showed that across the board, a higher percentage of white students
than black students were using drugs.
   ``It goes against conventional wisdom _ particularly television
has portrayed the problem of drug abuse in the United States as a
black, inner city problem,'' said Doug Hall, vice president of
PRIDE.
   The focus on inner-city drug use by blacks ``feeds the
increasing expressions of racism that surface daily in our
country,'' PRIDE co-founder Marsha Keith Schuchard said at a news
conference Monday.
   Atlanta-based PRIDE surveyed the students at 958 schools in 38
states during the 1988-89 school year, including students in
inner-city areas in Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, New York and
Washington D.C., Hall said.
   Of the 40,000 high school seniors surveyed, only 4 percent of
the black students said they had used cocaine at least once in the
previous year, while 7 percent of the white students said they had
done so.
   Meanwhile, 11 percent of black male seniors and 12 percent of
white male seniors said they used marijuana very frequently,
meaning at least once a week. Fourteen percent of black male
seniors and 17 percent of white male seniors said they used liquor
very frequently.
   The students surveyed filled out anonymous questionnaires that
were spot checked internally with somewhat duplicated questions to
determine the truthfulness of responses. There also were occasional
re-tests of groups of students, Hall said. There was no overall
margin of error because the results were based on actual responses
and the survey was not a scientific, random poll.
   The survey's findings for overall drug use by seniors in high
school, totals for senior high school students including 12th
graders and junior high school students were:
   _Cocaine: 7 percent of white seniors, 4 percent of black
seniors; 5 percent of white high school students, 3 percent of
black high school students; 2 percent of white junior high
students, 1 percent of black junior high students.
   _Liquor: 65 percent of white seniors; 37 percent of black
seniors; 57 percent of white high school students, 29 percent of
black high school students; 28 percent of white junior high
students; 13 percent of black junior high students.
   _Marijuana: 29 percent of white seniors; 17 percent of black
seniors; 24 percent of white high school students, 13 percent of
black high school students; 8 percent of white junior high
students; 5 percent of black junior high students.
   _Hallucinogens: 6 percent of white seniors; 2 percent of black
seniors; 5 percent of white high school students; 2 percent of
black high school students; 2 percent of white junior high
students; 1 percent of black junior high students.
   _Stimulants: 11 percent of white seniors; 3 percent of black
seniors; 11 percent of white high school students, 2 percent of
black high school students; 4 percent of white junior high
students; 2 percent of black junior high students.
   PRIDE was founded by a group of parents to fight drug abuse.

<HEAD>Ted Turner Gets Educational Organization Support</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National educational organizations are lining
up behind broadcaster Ted Turner in a campaign to put his
commercial-free news into high school classrooms instead of
commercially sponsored Channel One.
   Associations representing administrators, principals, teachers,
parents and school board members appeared at a news conference
Monday with Turner to promote use of CNN Newsroom, the daily
15-minute program produced by Turner Broadcasting System of Atlanta.
   Spokesmen for several groups coupled their endorsement with
charges that Channel One, a daily 12-minute program produced by
Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., amounts to commercial
exploitation of students.
   Jeremiah Floyd, associate executive director of the National
School Boards Association, although reaffirming his group's
previous support for the Turner show, did not criticize Channel One.
   ``It is a local proposition and if that's the only game in town
and the local people decide they want to go with that game, then
that's their prerogative,'' Floyd said.
   Channel One also was criticized for offering to install
television sets, video recorders and satellite dishes at
participating schools.
   ``Exploitation of a captive audience in the classroom, using the
classroom and the curriculum as a marketplace for products rather
than a marketplace for ideas, and selling or trading students in a
classroom for a satellite dish or a television monitor are
outrageous breaches of ethical practice,'' said Gary Marx,
associate executive director of the American Association of School
Administrators.
   A spokesman for Whittle Communications, David Gerard,
interviewed by telephone at his office in Nashville, Tenn.,
defended the use of commercial sponsors.
   ``We are not introducing advertising to schools,'' Gerard said,
arguing that newspapers and magazines with advertising have long
been used as teaching tools.
   He said the company will have sold about $200 million worth of
advertising on Channel One by the end of the year. Whittle tested
its program in six schools for seven weeks last spring and plans to
begin national broadcasting in March.
   Scott Thompson, executive director of the National Association
of Secondary School Principals, said the organization has written
to all of the companies that advertise on Channel One explaining
his group's objections.
   ``I am delighted that a number of these companies, for their own
reasons, have decided not to continue sponsoring Channel One,''
Thompson said.
   He said no company had written back to say that it planned to
continue its sponsorship, although he understood that the M&amp;M Mars
candy company, one of the sponsors during the spring test, intended
to do so.
   Contacted at the company's headquarters in Hackensack, N.J.,
Hans Fiuczynski, director of external relations for M&amp;M Mars, said
the company received such a letter from the association during the
spring test of Channel One.
   He said M&amp;M Mars replied that it was aware that the program was
controversial but understood that it had been approved by local
school boards in the test communities. As to whether the candy
company would be a sponsor of the national news program, Fiuczynski
said it was against the company's policy to disclose future
marketing plans.
   Turner, president of Turner Broadcasting, said CNN Newsroom had
an enrollment of 1,000 schools when it was launched in August and
now has 5,000. He said he expects to reach 10,000 by the start of
the next school year in September.
   Whittle Communications said in November that it had 1,050
schools lined up. The company has said it hopes to expand this to
8,000 schools by the end of 1990.
   With Turner at the news conference were Thompson, Marx, Floyd
and Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
and Tari Marshall, director of public relations for the National
Parent-Teacher Association.

   If your child tells you Santa promised
something outrageous, I know the reason: Santa doesn't always hear
so well.
   I should know. I was Santa. For a few hours, anyway.
   ``Did she tell you what she wants for Christmas?'' the mother
asked, hurrying over after her youngest and shyest child had her
turn with St. Nick.
   ``I didn't understand her,'' Santa replied.
   ``Oh, well. She won't tell us and we had hoped ...'' The mother
trailed away, smiling and accompanied by a laugh that wasn't a
ho-ho-ho.
   To help me catch the children's words, I kept a small tape
recorder at my side. Playing back the tape, the only speaker always
clear was the one on the mall intercom: ``Will the owner of the
blue Ford parked ...''
   The little blond girl spoke softly, and Santa couldn't make out
her name. Asked what she wanted for Christmas, she said, ``A
ball.'' Or was it, ``a doll?''
   Sunday was Santa's busiest day of the week at the Southridge
Mall. Tracey Bruner Rayhons, the mall's marketing director, agreed
to let me sit in for the regular Santa to hear childrens' dreams.
   Ms. Rayhons had one condition. ``Don't promise them anything. We
had one Santa last year, we never did find out which one it was,
who promised the kids anything they wanted. Boy did we have some
parents angry,'' she said.
   When I tried on a Santa suit, I found my doctor hadn't lied: No
padding was needed. Mike Wiley, one of four Santas working at
Southridge, had some pointers before I left for Santa's seat.
   The children will be well behaved, he said.
   ``I've had a couple who like to pull the beard, but I don't
think any of us have been wet on yet. I think we've all been real
lucky.''
   He said children ``are a lot more mellow this year. They don't
ask for a whole lot. ... What they're asking for is for one gift
that's expensive, like a Nintendo, bicycle, VCR, television, like
they're asking for one thing and that's all.''
   In my hour and a half as Santa, I found he was right.
   But I also found out more.
   Most children were eager to sit on Santa's knee. The only
beard-pullers were a couple of toddlers looking for something to
hang on to.
   Some young ones liked the idea of seeing Santa from a distance.
Up close was a different matter. It was just hang on to Mommy and
... maybe next year.
   There were times when management's advice came in handy.
   With Don on my left knee asking for ``a real puppy'' and sister
Misty on my right knee asking for ``a bicycle and a ... real kitty
cat,'' it may have been best not to promise anything.
   When a petite brunette named Allison sat on my knee, her father
piped in, ``She hasn't been cleaning her room like she should.''
   She confirmed that, but promised, ``I will when I get home.''
   Not only that, but she said she would keep her room clean until
Christmas and even after Christmas. All she wants is ``a dolly that
cries.''
   And there was Elizabeth, who also asked for a doll that cries,
and a puppy. She also gave something back.
   ``Want to hear a secret?'' she suddenly asked, looking at Santa.
   She whispered in Santa's ear: ``I love you Santa Claus.''
   ``Ohhh, Santa Claus loves you, too.''

<HEAD>Corcoran Gallery Loses Director in Furor Over Controversial Art</HEAD>

   The venerable Corcoran Gallery of Art is
looking for a new director to succeed Christina Orr-Cahall, the
victim of harsh criticism for canceling an exhibit last summer that
contained sexually explicit photographs.
   After less than two years on the job, Ms. Orr-Cahall resigned
Monday ``in the hope that my decision will help to eliminate or
abate those extraneous and disruptive difficulties'' that have
plagued the Corcoran for the past six months.
   The Corcoran board of trustees agreed overwhelmingly to accept
her resignation effective Feb. 1. Gallery president Freeborn G.
Jewett Jr. praised her ``professional skill, courage and loyalty''
and said she had always acted ``in the utmost good faith.''
   Jewett said he would appoint a search committee within a week to
nominate a successor to Ms. Orr-Cahall, who plunged the
120-year-old Corcoran into a maelstrom last June when she canceled
an exhibition of works by the late photographer Robert Mapplethorpe
two weeks before the show was scheduled to open July 1.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall said she was trying to avoid embroiling the
Corcoran, the oldest art gallery in Washington and the third oldest
private museum in the country, in an impending congressional battle
over grant-making policies of the National Endowment for the Arts.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other conservative members of
Congress bitterly attacked the endowment, an independent federal
agency, for underwriting the national tour of the Mapplethorpe
show, which contained homoerotic and sadomasochistic images and
pictures of nude children.
   The exhibit, organized by the Institute of Contemporary Arts in
Philadelphia, had appeared in Philadelphia and Chicago without
incident. After the Corcoran's cancellation, it was shown before
large crowds at the Washington Project for the Arts, another local
private gallery.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall's cancellation, which the Corcoran board approved
on two occasions, was severely criticized by the artistic
community. Artists protesting that the Corcoran was stifling
freedom of expression withdrew plans for two exhibitions of
contemporary art at the Corcoran and threatened the opening of a
third show.
   Artist Lowell Nesbitt withdrew a $1.5 million bequest to the
Corcoran from his will and said he would give the money instead to
the Phillips Collection, another private Washington art gallery.
   Plummeting staff morale worsened when Jane Livingston, the
Corcoran's chief curator, resigned. She had arranged for the
Mapplethorpe show to appear at the gallery. A representative of the
staff asked Ms. Orr-Cahall to resign at one point, but she refused.
   In her resignation letter to the Corcoran trustees, Ms.
Orr-Cahall, former chief curator of the Oakland Museum in
California, said it was time for the Corcoran to look to the future
``and to make every effort to assure that it is not consumed by the
kind of contention that distracts the institution from achieving
its goals.''
   Jewett said in a statement that the Mapplethorpe controversy
``has interfered with the Corcoran's capacity to address its full
energies and attention to the curatorial and educational tasks of
the museum and the school that are the institution's fundamental
responsibilities.''
   The board appointed a special committee in September to study
ways to repair the damage. One member, board chairman David Lloyd
Kreeger, told reporters that panel was divided over whether Ms.
Orr-Cahall should stay or leave the Corcoran.
   The panel, he said, left the decision up to the full board,
which he said also was divided. The dispute was resolved last
weekend when the director indicated her intention to quit. She
delivered her resignation letter to Jewett shortly before the board
met at midday Monday.
   Kreeger said the board was not concerned about the Mapplethorpe
cancellation, which Ms. Orr-Cahall had admitted was a mistake, but
was upset by the ``continued barrage'' of criticism that had
tarnished the Corcoran's reputation.
   Expressing hope that Ms. Orr-Cahall's resignation will lay the
controversy to rest, Kreeger vowed that ``there is going to be a
resurgent and a new and dynamic Corcoran.''

<HEAD>Advisory Committee Finds Radiation Safety Procedures Lacking</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Texas nuclear weapons assembly plant where
radioactive gas was accidentally released last spring was
unprepared for such an emergency, an Energy Department advisory
committee says.
   ``It is still unclear that effective control of the situation by
an adequately prepared response team ever took place,'' John F.
Ahearne, chairman of the Advisory Committee on Nuclear Facility
Safety, said in a letter about the Pantex plant in Amarillo, Texas.
   The letter to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins, released
Monday, also raised questions about safety and environmental
practices at Pantex, the nation's only final assembly plant for
nuclear bombs and missile warheads.
   The committee said the response to the May release of tritium, a
radioactive gas, was of ``variable quality.''
   Radiation specialists and technicians responded properly to
minimize workers' exposure at the plant, the report said.
   ``Missing was recognition that this `unlikely event' could take
place, and thus adequate procedures, instrumentation and training
were lacking,'' the letter said.
   Although a quick and effective evacuation was conducted,
thereafter, ``events are marked by confusion, misread instruments
and uncertain actions. There appeared to be no plan to handle what
surely must be an anticipated accident,'' the report said.
   Pantex spokesman Tom Walton said the plant has begun correcting
problems or ``will be addressing those in the very near future.''
Some safety violations were corrected on the spot.
   The report said cleaning up the facility after the accident was
estimated to cost $1 million ``and the psychological trauma on the
individuals exposed.''
   Exposure to workers, however, was below federal guidelines
limiting radiation exposure and ``off-site exposure was trivial.''
   The letter said the committee found a ``lack of belief that
Pantex can have radiological accidents, in spite of the recent
tritium accident.''
   A ``tiger team'' of government and outside experts also recently
inspected the plant and found Pantex would be unable to respond
effectively to emergencies involving releases of radioactive
material.
   Watkins said those findings indicate workers lack adequate
protection from emergency and routine exposure to radioactive
releases and that the situation must be corrected immediately.
   The advisory committee, which spent two days in Amarillo last
month, found ``an apparent lack of sophistication and depth
regarding environmental problems'' at Pantex.
   Monitoring of possible ground water contamination with wells at
Pantex also has been less than systematic, the letter said.
   ``This issue has just not received a great deal of attention.
This is particularly unfortunate since ground water contamination,
if found, would be a threat to the sole source of drinking water
for the area,'' the letter said.

   A young girl was shot to death at a mall
jammed with holiday shoppers, and police arrested a 12-year-old boy
following a three-hour search.
   Jacalyn Calabrese, 12, of Orange, who was shot once in the head
at the Mall of Orange, apparently knew the boy, said police Sgt.
Art Ramo.
   The suspect, whose name was not released because of his age, was
being questioned late Monday, Romo said. No motive was given.
   The boy was arrested outside a home about three blocks from the
mall after a search by helicopters, police dogs and officers,
authorities said.
   A guard at the Sears department store that anchors one end of
the mall said guards from the store chased the boy after Monday
evening's shooting, but he escaped.
   The mall was jammed with holiday shoppers when the shooting
occurred, said Maria Jacobs, the Sears' manager.

<TEXT>
   In the past 20 years, Italy's Roman Catholic Church
has lost battles on divorce and abortion. Now it is facing a
challenge to its affluence as well as its influence.
   Starting Jan. 1, the Italian government will no longer provide a
guaranteed stipend to the church, ending a system that has been in
place in one form or another for 300 years.
   Instead, the government will create a special pool, made up of
.8 percent of tax revenues, or about $650 million.
   When filling out their tax returns in May, citizens can check
whether they want the money to go to the Catholic Church, other
churches or to the government for its social and cultural programs.
   ``We are moving toward self-sufficiency for the church,'' said
Monsignor Tino Marchi, president of the Italian bishops
conference's Institute for the Maintenance of Clergy. ``The
faithful were used to thinking that priests could be helped by
offerings but that the state would take care of them.''
   The development is the latest result of the revised concordat,
or church-state agreement, that took effect in 1985. The accord
abolished Catholicism as the state religion and reduced the
emphasis on religious instruction in public schools.
   The church hierarchy says it's glad at the cut off in government
funding, which sometimes made servants of the Lord feel more like
civil servants. But it is concerned about how the church will fare
relying on its often wayward flock.
   ``It's a new thing,'' said Archbishop Camillo Ruini,
secretary-general of the Italian bishops conference. ``Nine
Italians out of 10 don't know about it. It's a long road.''
   More than 90 percent of Italians are Catholics, but religious
practice has plunged in recent years as Italy has become more
wealthy and secular. Only about 25 percent of Italians regularly
attend Mass and the church was rebuffed in its efforts to ban
divorce and abortion in public referendums in 1974 and 1981.
   Still, Catholic leaders say, the church remains important for
Italians and is respected for its extensive social-service network
that aids the handicapped, the elderly, recovering drug addicts and
youth.
   ``Although many people don't go to church, they approve of the
responsibilities of the church, and understand that it must be kept
up,'' Ruini said in an interview.
   But the leadership is taking no chances. To promote the new
system, Catholic authorities have distributed more than 10 million
flyers in churches and hung up hundreds of posters.
   Catholic leaders have appealed to accountants to advise their
clients of tax-free deductions to the church, and a special insert
about the new system was published in Italy's top business
newspaper, Il Sole-24 Ore.
   But there is reason for concern.
   The church estimates it will need about $280 million a year to
take care of the 40,000 Italian priests. It hopes most of the money
will come from offerings to a central fund, which are
tax-deductible up to $1,500, starting with returns for 1989.
   However, the fund will probably raise less than $8 million in
its first year.
   The tax pool pie will be split according to the proportion of
check-offs each group gets. The Catholic Church hopes to use its
share for social services and maintainence of churches, in addition
to paying priests.
   Italy's small Jewish community, which has been self-financed,
chose not to receive money from the tax pool and is counting on
contributions.
   Marchi admits not all priests are happy about the new system.
   ``Like all changes, especially for those people of a certain
age, it can cause difficulty, unease,'' he said.
   Priest salaries in the past year, which were mostly paid out of
government funds, ranged from $680 to $1,240 a month, depending on
expenses, responsibility and age.
   Church officials say contributions have been steadily increasing
and they are counting on their information campaign. But they say
it is not easy to change a mentality that has existed for centuries.
   Convincing people to give is especially difficult in southern
Italy, where the church used to enjoy a wealth of possessions and
priests generally lived much better than their parishioners, who
were mostly poor.
   ``People have never been responsible for taking care of their
own parish,'' said the Rev. Giovanni Borrelli, who is in charge of
promoting the new finance system in the Naples area.
   ``Until the end of the last century, if one was doing well, or
had a well-paying job, people would say they `had a priest in the
house' _ it was a way of saying they had a significant source of
income.''
   The church in overwhelmingly Catholic Spain was shocked this
year to find that only 35 percent of taxpayers had chosen to check
off the Catholic Church to receive a tax fund like the one to be
set up in Italy.
   Italian officials say they expect to do better. They point out
that 96 percent of Italian parents made the choice to keep their
children in religion classes in public schools.
   ``I am not living this in a state of anxiety,'' Ruini said. ``In
Italy the church is seen well.''

<HEAD>Senator D'Amato Says FAA Covered Up Knowledge of Terrorism Warnings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senator on the presidential commission
investigating air terrorism is accusing Federal Aviation
Administration officials of covering up knowledge of terrorism
warnings posted only for government employees.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., lashed out the FAA during a
commission hearing Monday, saying they've ``flunked'' in protecting
air passengers.
   At the second hearing of the President's Commission on Aviation
Security and Terrorism, D'Amato produced a cable showing the FAA
knew of warnings issued to U.S. Embassy employees in Moscow prior
to the Dec. 21, 1988, bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,
Scotland, which killed 270 people.
   State Department and FAA officials say posting of the terrorist
alert in Moscow on Dec. 13 was an error which went against a policy
of not warning government officials without issuing general public
warnings of a terrorist threat.
   D'Amato, one of seven members of the commission looking into the
Flight 103 bombing and air terrorism issues, praised embassy
officials in Moscow for posting the warning.
   ``Thank God the ambassador published it because he saved some
lives,'' D'Amato said.
   FAA security director Raymond Salazar said it has never been
shown that any embassy personnel canceled reservations on Flight
103 because of the warning.
   ``You either are incredibly incompetent or you covered up,''
D'Amato told Salazar, who said he could not recall seeing the Dec.
13 message from Moscow until a copy was sent two months after the
Dec. 21 bombing.
   The cable acknowledged receipt of an FAA advisory of a threat
against Pan Am flights between Frankfurt and New York, which U.S.
officials later said proved to be a hoax even though the threat fit
details of the Pan Am bombing. Flight 103 began with a different
plane in Frankfurt and was en route from London to New York when it
blew up.
   ``Since a number of people from this post will be flying out of
Frankfurt in the next two weeks,'' the cable said, ``post plans to
issue an internal administrative notice warning employees of the
threat.... No recommendation will be made as to course of action to
be followed by travelers.''
   Monte Belger, FAA associate administrator, said the agency did
nothing to stop the embassy from warning government employees even
though such a selective warning is against government policy.
   Belger told the commission that, in retrospect, he wishes that
someone in the FAA had focused on the message and called the State
Department to stop the posting of the warning, ``but we didn't.''
   FAA senior intelligence analyst Claude Manno, who acknowledged
receiving the original message on Dec. 13, said he ``probably
shredded it.''
   D'Amato said studies by the General Accounting Office indicate
that ``the FAA and the present system have flunked when it comes to
providing basic security systems that anyone can have confidence
in.''
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, in an interview on
Cable News Network, denied the assertion, saying, ``The FAA has
done a very good job in implementing a number of programs in the
last year to enhance our protection.''
   Skinner noted a program to install sophisticated bomb detection
equipment at key airports, fines against airlines for security
lapses and new FAA personnel added to foreign posts.
   D'Amato said problems with the FAA suggest there may be a
conflict between its role of promoting aviation and that of
ensuring passenger safety.
   The GAO report said stepped-up security measurers since the
disaster may be ineffective at high-risk foreign airports due to a
lack of training standards.
   Earlier reports found problems with passenger screening, airport
security controls and security inspections.

<HEAD>Excise Tax May be Sought on Recreational Gear, Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's tentative plan to
seek new excise taxes on some recreational gear and vehicles can be
defended as a user fee _ not a new tax _ because the money would be
earmarked for a specific purpose, sources say.
   The revenue from such a tax would be used to pay for
conservation initiatives, administration sources said Monday night.
   President Bush on Monday told a group of reporters he expects
his 1991 budget proposal will let him keep his ``no new taxes''
pledge for a second year.
   Sources who sought anonymity told The Associated Press that some
officials opposed the idea of a recreational excise tax as a
violation of the president's pledge of ``no new taxes.'' One
source, however, argued that, ``These are true user fees.''
   Several sources said the tax could qualify as a user fee because
it is dedicated to a specific purpose.
   Quoting an Office of Management and Budget memorandum, The
Washington Post reported today the tax would range from 1 percent
to 2.5 percent on recreational and off-road vehicles, camping
equipment and pleasure boats, and would raise $275 million a year.
   Among the programs to receive funds from the initiative would be
new purchases of land for national parks and other protected areas,
and for the planting of trees, the newspaper said.
   One non-government source said he expected excise taxes to form
only part of a ``shopping list'' of financing for environmental
measures from which Congress could pick and choose.
   That source, Derek A. Crandall, president of the American
Recreation Coalition, said, ``We've been assured that any new taxes
... would be proposed only in conjunction with the recreation
community and in a cooperative venture,'' and that had not been
done.
   An existing excise tax of 10 percent on the import or wholesale
price of fishing tackle and pleasure boat fuel, with revenues going
to state fish and game departments, ``has worked very well,''
Crandall said.
   ``We've suggested this model might work in certain other
cases,'' he said.
   Sport firearms currently carry an 11 percent excise tax.
   The last such tax on vehicles, however, expired in 1971, a 7
percent levy on both cars and light trucks.
   Steven Goldstein, spokesman for the Interior Department, whose
National Park and Fish and Wildlife services would spend much of
the money, said Monday night, ``We are still working with OMB to
develop our budget for the 1991 fiscal year and it would be
inappropriate for the department to comment'' before the president
submits his budget on Jan. 22.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
today after a week of consecutive gains, while the dollar inched
down against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.80 yen, down 0.42 yen from
Monday's close of 144.22 yen. It opened at 143.55 yen and ranged
between 143.15 yen and 143.97 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 147.08
points, or 0.38 percent, ending at 38,489.10. It had gained 315.14
points to a record-high close of 3,8586.18 the previous day.
   Dealers attributed the fall in the Nikkei to the market's
speculation that Japan's central bank may raise its official
discount rate this week, partly to shore up the value of the yen
against the dollar.
   ``Since the market already is reacting to the reports, impact of
the reaction would be minimal if and when the central bank actually
announces the hike,'' said Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura
Securities Co.
   ``We consider today's 149.43-point decline as small, considering
the negative impact of the rumor,'' he said.
   The Yomiuri Shinbun and the Asahi Shinbun, Japan's two largest
newspapers, reported that the Bank of Japan will hike its official
discount rate by 0.5 percentage point to 4.25 percent.
   But Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he had no plans to
discuss a rate increase with the Bank of Japan officials ``today or
tomorrow at least.''
   The official discount rate is the rate the central bank charges
on its loans to commercial banks and often influences other
interest rates. Higher interest rates discourage stock investors,
but it makes a country's currency more attractive to currency
investors.
   A trader with a major Japanese commercial bank anonymously said
the yen is likely to soar against the dollar if the Bank of Japan
raise the discount rate.

   Don and Kathy Blackburn began taking in sick
and abandoned children while serving as missionaries in Haiti, and
came to love them so much they've brought all 28 home to adopt.
   ``It turned into a family and snowballed,'' Blackburn said as
the couple arrived to a rousing welcome Monday night at
Indianapolis International Airport. The Blackburns and their
children _ ages 3 to 14 _ headed for a church camp where they'll
stay in a dormitory until they find a home.
   The arrival of the Christian Evangelical missionaries and the
children culminated two years of efforts by Christian groups in
this country to bring the family to the Blackburns' home state.
   The Blackburns fled Haiti for the neighboring Dominican Republic
in 1987 during the turbulence that followed the 1986 ouster of
dictator Jean Claude Duvalier. This month, they won special holiday
parole status from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
bring the children to the United States.
   ``This is one of the most fantastic things that ever happened,''
a tearful Mrs. Blackburn said at the airport, where she and her
husband were greeted by friends and relatives who hadn't seen them
since they left for Haiti 13 years ago.
   Dressed in sweaters and brightly colored sneakers, the children
lugged handmade cloth bags containing a change of clothing. Their
only other possessions were two dogs and two cats that also made
the trip.
   The children _ who glimpsed snow for the first time during a
stop in Chicago _ chased each other through the terminal, ate candy
and examined the equipment of television news crews.
   ``We thought we could sneak through without any notice,'' Mrs.
Blackburn, 42, said. ``We didn't think anybody would care if we had
28 kids. We take it for granted.''
   The group left by bus for the campground in the town of Letts,
30 miles southeast of Indianapolis, where they will live in a
dormitory with nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms. Mrs. Blackburn's
sister, Marianne Lortz, will help care for the brood.
   The children were granted humanitarian parole by INS
Commissioner Gene McNary in Miami because they were ineligible for
entry under any other category. Under immigration law, the
commissioner may allow an otherwise inadmissible alien to enter the
country temporarily for humanitarian reasons, or when such entry is
considered in the national interest.
   After granting parole, the INS worked with the State Department
to speed paperwork so the family could be home together by
Christmas, McNary said.
   The Blackburns, with their two sons, started a ministry in the
small mountain village of Maissade in 1976. After they had lived
there about 18 months, they began caring for sick or abandoned
children who were brought to their home.
   All but two of the children came to the Blackburns as babies,
including the youngest, who was just 6 hours old. All speak English.
   The couple brought the children to this country seeking a more
stable environment, and because they believe it will be easier to
adopt them here. Adoption efforts were blocked in Haiti and the
Dominican Republic because the children's biological parents are
dead, unknown or untraceable.
   The Blackburns, whose own children are in their 20s and living
on their own, are supported in the venture by churches and
organizations that have sponsored them for 14 years.
   ``We feel like the Lord was guiding and working to bring us
here,'' said Mrs. Blackburn.
   Eventually the family will find somewhere other than the church
camp to live or build a home large enough to accommodate the family.
   ``We'll home-school them for now,'' said Blackburn, 45.
``Everything is so new to them.''
   Asked how she and her husband managed to keep track of 28
children, Mrs. Blackburn said: ``Jesus Christ. There is no other
secret. Jesus has always taken care of us.''
   Planning, however, is important in managing such a large group.
   ``You just organize a little bit more. You don't go off and
leave them for two or three hours,'' she said. ``Nobody babysits
for crowds like that.''

   Police union leaders expressed skepticism and a
wait-and-see stand over the appointment of Houston Police Chief Lee
Brown as the city's new police commissioner.
   ``Midtown South is bigger than the whole town of Houston. Our
problems are 20 times bigger. Let's see what he can do,'' said Lt.
James Gebhardt, head of the Lieutenants Benevolent Association, a
union that represents 1,100 lieutenants.
   Brown, 52, has headed a 4,000-officer department in Houston
since 1982, and Gebhardt questioned whether he is prepared to run
the 26,000-officer force, the nation's largest.
   ``The challenges are there. It's whether he can handle a
department this big,'' Gebhardt said.
   Mayor-elect David Dinkins selected Brown on Monday over four
other finalists, including the current commissioner, Richard Condon.
   ``We need the best police commissioner we could find,'' Dinkins
told reporters. ``Of all of the finalists, he seemed to be the
absolute best in the country.''
   Brown will take over Jan. 22 in a city wracked with drug-related
crime. The murder rate is at a record level, with crack the prime
cause.
   ``The thing that will hit him immediately is the drug-crime
problem,'' said Thomas Reppetto, head of the independent watchdog
Citizens Crime Commission and a member of the search committee that
interviewed Brown.
   Brown, who called his appointment a ``once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity,'' has served as public safety chief in Houston,
Atlanta and Portland, Ore.
   Small potatoes, some said.
   ``Atlanta and Houston are different from New York City. I think
he's going to find that out very quickly. I think he's got a tough
row to hoe,'' said Michael Vecchione, a former department attorney
who now sits on the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
   ``He's an out-of-towner so he'll have to learn the city
system,'' said Sgt. Joe Toal, head of the Sergeants Benevolent
Association of 3,000 sergeants. ``I guess we're in for a lot of
changes.''
   Brown is the first commissioner from out of town since Howard
Leary of Philadelphia served from 1966-1970. Vecchione said his
outsider status wasn't an asset.
   ``Police officers do not take well to outsiders. It's not going
to be easy for him,'' Vecchione said.
   ``Why did they have to go outside? Does this mean that there is
nobody in the NYPD who is qualified?'' asked the Rev. Lawrence
Lucas, a black activist who is pastor of the Roman Catholic Church
of The Resurrection in Harlem.
   Condon predicted that Brown's biggest challenge ``is definitely
the budget and the fact that we have a tremendous problem with
narcotics.''
   ``The preliminary estimate is that we are not going to be adding
to the police department. If anything, we're going to be losing
police officers. I think that's a terrible problem,'' Condon said.
   Vecchione also said Brown will have a difficult time figuring
out New York's police department. ``It will take time until he
knows where all the bodies are buried,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Declares Leaflet Regulation Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 1976 regulation barring people from passing
out leaflets near the White House has been declared
unconstitutional by a federal judge who says such a ban violates
the First Amendment and has ``no conceivable governmental
interest.''
   U.S. District Court Judge John Pratt ruled Monday in the case of
Carol Ann Fennelly, charged with illegally distributing pamphlets
in June on a street between the White House and Treasury Department.
   The material urged passers-by to write members of Congress in
favor of housing for the homeless.
   Regulations approved in 1970 were part of an effort to protect
White House security by restrictions on demonstrations. The
provision at issue in Fennelly's case was added in 1976 to preserve
an atmosphere of calm and tranquility at memorials and buildings
associated with past presidents.
   Pratt noted that Fennelly ``would violate the regulation by
passing out a leaflet,'' but ``could convey the same identical
message by word of mouth without fear of arrest.''

<HEAD>Dollar Edges Down, Stocks Lose</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index ended seven
days of gains and the dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
today, as markets were stirred by rumors of an impending discount
rate increase.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.80 yen, down 0.42 yen from
Monday's 144.22-yen close. It opened at 143.55 yen and ranged
between 143.15 and 143.97 yen.
   ``Trading was hectic because of the rumor,'' said Minori
Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   In spot active trading in which an estimated $10.8 billion
traded hands, Japanese investors sold the dollar and the West
German mark to buy the yen during morning trading. In the afternoon
they bought the currencies back after Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto denied the reports of an interest rate increase.
   Hashimoto said the current Japanese economic situation did not
require another discount rate hike because of stable prices, but
that exchange rate levels required watching.
   The Bank of Japan has raised its discount rate twice this year
to the current 3.75 percent.
   Following Hashimoto's remarks, Bank of Japan official Tatsuya
Tamura said in a statement that government interest rate policy was
``a blank slate.''
   The Yomiuri Shimbun and the Asahi Shimbun, Japan's two largest
newspapers, reported today that the Bank of Japan would hike its
official discount rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4.25 percent by
this weekend.
   Ms. Takeuchi said the government's denial made the market
players shift their attention from domestic to U.S. monetary
policy, ``because the market now expects the hike will be postponed
at least until after February, when (Japanese) national elections
are expected.''
   The official discount rate is the rate the central bank charges
on its loans to commercial banks, which often influences other
interest rates. Higher interest rates make a country's currency
more attractive to currency investors, but discourages stock
investors.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 147.08 points, or 0.38 percent, closing at 38,489.10. It had
gained 315.14 points to a record-high close of 38,586.18 on Monday.
   Dealers attributed the loss to the discount rate rumors.
   ``Until the bank actually raises the rate, the market will move
nervously every time somebody spreads the rumor in the market,''
said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a Daiwa Securities dealer.
   ``Since the market already has begun reacting to the rumors, the
impact will be minimal if and when the central bank actually
announces a hike,'' said Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura
Securities.
   ``We consider today's decline small, considering the negative
impact of the rumor,'' he said.
   Volume on the market's first section was an estimated 900
million shares, up from Monday's 850 million shares.

<TEXT>
   An obstetrician was convicted of
second-degree murder for the deaths of eight infants during bungled
high-risk deliveries he performed in his office rather than in
hospitals.
   Jurors deliberated 19 days before returning the verdict against
Dr. Milos Klvana, 47, who prosecutors accused of continuing his
practice even though he knew he wasn't qualified to handle risky
births.
   Klvana was convicted Monday of nine counts of second-degree
murder and of 43 other felonies including insurance fraud, grand
theft, perjury, conspiracy and practicing medicine without a
license.
   Klvana, a resident of suburban Santa Clarita, could be sentenced
to 15 years to life in prison on the second-degree murder charges.
Sentencing was set for Jan. 12.
   Midway through the return of the verdicts in Superior Court,
Klvana jumped to his feet and told Judge Judith Chirlin, ``I want
to be excused.''
   He was allowed to leave the courtroom, but returned after all
the verdicts were read. He asked the judge for a new trial and said
he would represent himself.
   Prosecutors said Klvana bungled deliveries in his Valencia and
Temple City medical offices between 1982 and 1986, causing one
stillbirth and the deaths of eight infants shortly after birth.
   Klvana, who was convicted in 1978 on 26 counts of illegally
prescribing drugs, was arrested in October 1986 following a
two-year investigation of the childbirth deaths.
   Prosecutors said the Czechoslovakian-born physician lacked the
training to deliver the babies but knew enough to realize the
mothers should have been taken to the hospital.
   ``There was no question that the man knew what he was doing was
dangerous,'' Deputy District Attorney Brian R. Kelberg said. ``He
did it for reasons that were selfish rather than in the best
interest of his patients. He's not just incompetent, but he knows
he's incompetent.''
   Among the women whose babies died, the prosecution said, were an
insulin dependent diabetic and two women who had RH factor blood
types, making their pregnancies risky even in hospitals.
   Klvana contended he was singled out because of his unorthodox
birthing practices including out-of-hospital deliveries and the use
of a labor-inducing drug that prosecutors said should only be
administered in hospitals.
   The prosecutor never contended that Klvana intended to kill the
babies. But he argued that the doctor knew that deaths or
stillbirths could result from his recommendations against
hospitalizing the mothers.
   Klvana's attorneys conceded that he was negligent but argued
there was no basis for a murder conviction, saying the doctor did
not understand his own incompetence.
   Early in the trial, Klvana's co-defendant, Dolores Doyle, 36, an
unlicensed midwife, unexpectedly pleaded guilty to involuntary
manslaughter and insurance fraud in a plea bargain. She was
released on probation, having already served two years in prison.
   Klvana has spent all but three months in jail since his 1986
arrest. His $200,000 bail was revoked when it was learned he had
applied for a new certification to prescribe drugs and was
dispensing oral contraceptives.

<TEXT>
   An expert on the Mediterranean fruit fly has
developed a poison bait for the crop-destroying pest that he says
might enable California to end aerial spraying in a few years.
   Roy T. Cunningham, a U.S. Department of Agriculture entomologist
based in Hilo, said Monday he plans to begin tests early next year
on a compound that's a mix of a new, long-lasting chemical
attractant and pesticide. It is designed to be sprayed on trees and
utility poles.
   The bait, called Ceralure, is mixed with malathion, the same
pesticide California authorities have in recent weeks been spraying
from helicopters over wide stretches of the Los Angeles suburbs to
control a Medfly outbreak.
   Though scientists insist the pesticide is safe in the minute
quantities used, spraying is the focus of emotional debate in
California, where the flies threaten a $16 billion farm industry.
Residents and some environmental groups oppose each new round of
spraying as unsafe, while farmers and government agriculture
experts insist it's necessary and harmless.
   California officials have spent $10 million battling 13
outbreaks this year. A 1980-82 infestation cost California
taxpayers $100 million for eradication and cost growers about $100
million in lost sales.
   The Medfly, one of the most damaging fruit flies, attacks more
than 250 fruits and vegetables. Most of the damage is done when
females deposit their eggs in crops, making them unmarketable.
   Medflies get into California as eggs or larvae in fruit and
produce, usually illegally imported or mailed from Hawaii or
Central America.
   The Ceralure gel is ``a much simpler and a much less costly
system than we presently have,'' said Cunningham, who chairs a
committee that advises California officials on fighting Medfly
outbreaks.
   It could eventually replace aerial spraying, but it will take
two to three years of testing to determine if the substance is an
effective and safe option, Cunningham said.
   California's Department of Food and Agriculture has agreed to
help fund the study of Ceralure's effectiveness, providing $83,600
during the next three years, said Isi A. Siddiqui, the agency's
assistant director.
   Blobs of the Ceralure gel shot from trucks onto trees and
utility poles would attract male Medflies, whihch would be killed
by the pesticide, Cunningham said.
   The key to the new system is that Ceralure appears to stay
effective for two weeks. If that proves the case, it may be
cost-effective to use the substance to fight fly outbreaks in
California, reapplying the Ceralure every two weeks, Cunningham
said.
   The gel technique has already been used in California to fight
the Medfly's cousin, the Oriental fruit fly.
   Cunningham said researchers don't understand how Ceralure
attracts the male Medflies.

<HEAD>New Canal Lock Gates Cause For Celebration In Lockport</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOCKPORT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city that draws its name and history
from the westernmost locks of the Erie Canal plans a party tonight
for a public works project _ the replacement of the lock gates that
were installed 72 years ago.
   Lockport residents plan to celebrate with light and song even
though the days have long since passed when Lockport's locks were
the city's lifeblood.
   ``It's probably the most significant thing to happen to the
community, certainly the most significant investment in the
canal,'' said Mary Brennan-Taylor, chairwoman of the Canal
Spotlight Committee.
   The locks, she said, bring tourists and ``give the community a
sense of identity.''
   Lockport's two locks carry the canal up over the Niagara
Escarpment on the final leg of its route from Albany to Buffalo.
The town was founded four years after the canal opened in 1825, and
grew to become a city in 1865.
   ``There were hotels, stores, bars, businesses along the canal.
There were grocery stores right down the lock,'' said assistant
city historian Howard Colbey. ``Mills used the spillway of the
locks for power.''
   John Bloom, a 73-year-old resident who worked on canal boats in
the 1930s and 1940s, said his barges used to stop for groceries in
Lockport, make deliveries to businesses along the canal and haul in
building stone from nearby quarries.
   ``There was one (barge) right after another, 24 hours a day,''
he said.
   The present gates were installed in 1917, when the entire canal
was rebuilt and widened. But the canal's usefulness as a shipping
route ended when the St. Lawrence Seaway opened in the 1950s, and
many of the flour, paper and textile mills along the canal went out
of business. Lockport's major employer today is the Harrison
Radiator Division of General Motors.
   The canal is now used mainly by pleasure boats, but interest in
the locks has been rising in the past few years. On summer days,
lock workers say, the walls and bridges overlooking the lock are
frequently jammed with sightseers.
   The attention paid to the $2.3 million lock replacement has
nevertheless surprised many of those working on the project.
   ``The local paper comes out every day and takes pictures,'' said
Earl Kostuk, job superintendent for SCC Contracting of Niagara
Falls, which is performing the work under state supervision.
   The plans for tonight's celebration call for 300 residents
holding red glowsticks to line the walls of the lock, singing
Christmas carols and the traditional Erie Canal folk song, ``Low
Bridge, Everybody Down,'' as all of Lockport's churches peal their
bells in unison, Mrs. Brennan-Taylor said.
   Downtown stores will stay open late, like they did when the
canal was an important shipping artery.
   Further festivities are planned for May, when the project is
finished and the canal opens again for navigation.
   Bloom, who tells fourth-graders about life on the barges as part
of the local history curriculum, said he was pleased by the plans.
   ``I think it's wonderful. They need it,'' he said. ``They should
never close the canal down.''

<HEAD>Eds: Testimony resumes at noon EST</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Columnist Art Buchwald testified in his
breach-of-contract lawsuit that he based the script idea for the
smash movie ``Coming to America'' on a real African king who drove
a Studebaker.
   But entertainer Arsenio Hall told the court he and comedian
Eddie Murphy brainstormed the 1988 movie.
   Buchwald was to return to the stand today after beginning his
testimony Monday in his $5 million lawsuit against Paramount
Pictures, which optioned the columnist's screenplay ``King for a
Day'' in 1984.
   Buchwald told Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider that he
wrote his script idea originally titled, ``It's a Crude, Crude
World,'' based on a ``data bank'' of experiences he keeps in his
head.
   The king, he said, may have been based on a Watusi king he
interviewed in Africa in the 1950s. ``He was a real king and he
drove a Studebaker,'' he recalled.
   Soon after he wrote the script idea, Buchwald said, producer and
co-plaintiff Alain Bernheim sold the option to Paramount and the
writer received $17,500, ``less 10 per cent to my agent.''
   The Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist and author said
negotiations began for Louis Malle to direct, and then he heard
that Murphy would star. ``I was delighted,'' he said.
   Buchwald contends that Paramount reneged on the production deal
and used his idea for the film that amassed $300 million in box
office earnings.
   Hall, the late-night TV talk-show host who co-starred in
``Coming to America,'' said he never saw a script idea entitled
``King for a Day.''
   Both stories tell the tale of an African prince who comes to the
United States, falls in love and takes home a bride.
   ``I think a lot of stories have been written about African
princes,'' Hall told reporters outside court. ``I'm offended
because Eddie is a very bright man. I'm a bright guy. Why do we
have to seek a stolen concept? It's insulting.''
   Buchwald, 64, said he was sorry Hall felt insulted.
   ``I like Arsenio. He's a nice fellow,'' he said. ``This is
between Paramount and me.''
   Paramount Chairman Frank Mancuso described Murphy's rich
contract with the studio, which gives him $8 million a picture plus
15 per cent of gross profits. And he indicated Murphy wants more.
   ``Like a good baseball player, we're always negotiating with
him,'' Mancuso said. ``He's a very important star.''
   Hall said he and Murphy set out in 1987 to create the first
black fairy tale. He said they were intent on improving the image
of blacks as well as Murphy's own screen image.
   ``There had never been a black fairy tale,'' Hall said. ``We
wanted to create like a fairy tale _ beautiful _ like the prince
got the girl. We wanted a fairy tale everyone could relate to.''
   Hall said he and Murphy wanted to shape the screenplay
themselves because ``otherwise, it would just be another black
story written by white people.''

   An Iranian oil tanker exploded
and caught fire today in the Atlantic northwest of the Canary
Islands and was reported sinking after its crew was rescued by a
Soviet freighter, officials said.
   The 284,632-ton Khark 5 sent out a distress signal at 5 a.m.
before its 35-man crew abandoned ship 350 miles from the Spanish
archipelago's capital and was picked up by the freighter Sarny,
Capt. David Rodriguez of the Las Palmas naval station said.
   Onda Pesquera, the Spanish ship-monitoring radio service based
in Barcelona, said the Soviet ship rescued the Iranian tanker's
crewmen and was expected to reach Las Palmas on Thursday.
   The Khark 5 forms part of the 19-vessel fleet operated by
state-run Iran National Tanker Co. It was twice attacked in the
Persian Gulf by Iraqi fighter-bombers during the Iran-Iraq war _
badly damaged by missiles March 3, 1987 and set afire on Feb. 5,
1988, with two crewmen wounded.
   Onda Pesquera director Jesus Ferreiro said there were no
immediate reports of injuries and the cause of the explosion was
not known. He said it was not known where the Iranian ship had been
headed.
   The Khark 5 was reportedly sinking, he said.

   The dollar firmed against most major foreign
currencies in quiet European trading late this morning. Gold prices
also rose.
   Traders said movements were exaggerated in the thin
pre-Christmas market.
   ``In this market, small amounts are enough to move the dollar,''
said one trader in Milan, Italy.
   ``It's really Christmas that's fixing the market,'' said
another. ``Most people are staying out just to look.''
   Dealers in Frankfurt said the dollar staged a small technical
recovery overnight on rumors of imminent changes in key Japanese
interest rates. The rumors resulted in the selling of marks and
buying of yen, which firmed the dollar-mark rate, they said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.42 yen to a closing 143.80 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 143.90 yen.

   Continued cold, sleet and snow slowed much of the nation today
and showed no signs of easing as another wall of Canadian air
churned through the Northern Plains toward the Northeast and
Midwest.
   The upper-level system was moving across the heartland to the
Great Lakes region today, dumping snow on parts of Iowa, Nebraska,
Missouri and Illinois. The center of the arctic air mass should
move into the Upper Midwest by late week, spawning even colder
weather.
   Advisories for freezing rain and sleet were posted today in
southeastern Arkansas, northern Louisiana and northern Mississippi.
   Up to 2 inches of snow were expected in northeastern Arkansas
today. Snowfall was expected to be heaviest in Illinois, where up
to 5 inches were forecast.
   Though winter doesn't officially begin until Thursday, ice has
already choked the Mississippi and Missouri rivers. Sleet iced
roads from Mississippi to the Carolinas on Monday.
   Storms with snow or freezing rain were forecast from Ohio and
western Pennsylvania through the Carolinas and across the South
into northeastern Texas.
   Snow also was expected in the northern Rockies. Wind gusts of up
to 60 mph were predicted today for southeastern Wyoming.
   Snow continued to fall across northern Maine.
   Snowfall for the six hours ending 7 p.m. EST Monday included 3
inches at Concordia and Topeka, Kan.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Omaha,
Neb.
   Record-breaking cold gripped 12 cities Monday, including
Youngstown, Ohio, at 12 degrees below zero; Pittsburgh's 7 below;
and Lexington, Ky., 1 below. The outlook for most of the country is
for below-average temperatures for the next month or so, according
to the National Weather Service.
   Florida remained the nation's only hot spot. Miami's forecast
today called for highs in the 80s.
   On Monday, three Florida cities set record highs for the date:
Ft. Lauderdale, with 87 degrees; Hollywood, 85; and Miami, 87,
which tied its highest-ever December reading.
   Monday's high temperature was 88 degrees at North Dade County
Airport near Miami, Fla.

   Redoubt Volcano's frequent eruptions
pumped tons of steam and ash into the air, covering parts of
south-central Alaska with a fine layer of gray grit and stranding
holiday mail and travelers.
   Variable winds spread ash clouds east, north and south, but
Anchorage, with almost half the state's population, was spared the
fallout. The heaviest ash concentrations were seen over the Kenai
Peninsula and Prince William Sound.
   Ash clouds were seen rising to 31,000 feet from Redoubt's
10,197-foot summit.
   ``The volcano is still very active,'' said Steve Brantley, a
geologist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory on Monday. ``We are
continuing to observe a high level of earthquake activity on the
mountain.''
   The swirling clouds of ash delayed or detoured air traffic in
and out of Anchorage, stacking up thousands of travelers and tons
of mail.
   The Anchorage International Airport was open Monday, but service
was irregular, with some airlines grounding aircraft and others
offering limited service. Some domestic airlines canceled flights
and international carriers routed their aircraft around Anchorage.
   At the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, hundreds of people
trying to get to Alaska were stranded.
   ``I guess my wife and I will be sleeping at the airport,'' said
Anchorage resident John Stout, 67, on Monday. The couple has been
stuck in Seattle since Saturday. They learned Monday that Delta Air
Lines would no longer pay for their hotel room.
   ``We can't go on indefinitely supplying people all over the
country with hotels and meals,'' Delta spokesman Ron Tansey said.
`` ... We're fairly optimistic we can get these people home.''
   Nancy Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Postal Service, said
the ash clouds were ``playing havoc with us. ... This is the
largest backup we've ever had.''
   About 22,000 pounds of mail was stacked in Anchorage on Monday
for shipment out of Alaska. Another 130,000 pounds waited in
Seattle for shipment to Alaska, she said.
   The postal service depends on commercial jets to move the mail,
but has resorted to chartering propeller aircraft, she said.
   ``The mail's moving, but slowly,'' she said.
   The Alaska Railroad added a train between Anchorage and
Fairbanks for travelers, said spokeswoman Vivian Hamilton.
   While some were trying to get on planes, a group of Korean Air
Line passengers refused to reboard their flight Monday, saying they
were concerned whether it was safe to fly.
   Flight 25 was en route from New York to Seoul on Saturday when
it landed in Anchorage. The flight was delayed and passengers were
taken to hotels.
   ``Then all these rumors started about the safety of the plane;
the volcanic ash,'' said Christine Lee, a Korean national with a
home in the United States. ``It's hard to tell what's really true.''
   Redoubt rumbled awake Thursday after two decades of slumber. It
has sent ash and steam skyward intermittently since. It is located
in a sparsely populated area 115 miles southwest of Anchorage in
the Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
   Last Friday, dust from Redoubt shut down all four engines of a
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines 747, causing the plane to plunge from
25,000 feet to 12,000 feet in 12 minutes before the crew could
restart the clogged engines.

   Michael Gross has found life after ``Family
Ties,'' although he was prepared to accept the relative obscurity
that can follow the end of a hit TV series.
   ``I really did wonder for a while if I was going to disappear
after the show went off the air,'' the actor said in a recent
interview. ``But then I realized that there are two definitions of
success: One is to be on a popular hit where everybody gets to see
what you do, and the second is to just do good work, regardless of
the size of the audience.''
   Gross, who portrayed the father of Michael J. Fox's Alex Keaton
in ``Family Ties,'' plays King Arthur in this week's NBC movie ``A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.'' He also has a role as
a survivalist in a science fiction film, ``Tremors,'' scheduled for
release next month.

<TEXT>
   When New York investors quietly bought most of
the Pike Place Market in the early 1980s, the deal was seen as a
boon for the popular complex that many call ``the soul of Seattle.''
   The sale provided $3 million to finish more than a decade of
renovation, repair and refurbishing and was central to the
renaissance of the surrounding area that went from down and out to
up and in.
   But the Manhattan-based Urban Group's recent demands for a
better return on their investment have upset market managers and
sparked concern from residents that the nature of their cherished
institution would change.
   The partially open-air market, which opened in 1907 as a way for
farmers to sell directly to consumers, sits on a bluff overlooking
Puget Sound. It's a chaotic mix: Fishmongers hawk salmon,
craftspeople display hand-knit sweaters, parents drop off their
children at a day-care center, and tourists are everywhere.
   About 15 million visitors go to the market each year.
   Urban Group vice presidents Arthur B. Malman and Martin Major
say they don't want to change the market's special character to get
a better profit. But others say profits may only come with major
change.
   Malman said a 10 percent return on investment would be about
right for recent years. He said investors have gotten just $3,000.
   Urban Group manages historic properties around the nation. From
the initial $3 million payment, Malman said investors have gained
$10 million in tax writeoffs. But he added, ``We don't keep score
with tax benefits. We keep score with profits.''
   He has accused the market's landlord and manager, Pike Place
Market Preservation and Development Authority, of inefficiency and
of saddling the 30 owner-investors with costs they should not have
to bear.
   The dispute over operating costs goes to arbitration this week.
Each side has named a property management expert to review figures
and legal documents. If the experts fail to reach agreement, they
are to name a third to resolve the issue. Both sides hope for a
settlement within the next few weeks.
   The fight already is costly. So far, Urban Group has spent about
$200,000 for an audit by Arthur Anderson &amp; Co. of the management.
The authority has spent about the same in legal fees.
   Merchants feel caught in the middle of the battle. Many fear big
rent increases, which may force some to move or close their doors.
   While a few have joined Urban in criticizing market management,
``I think there's a pretty good consensus'' in favor of the
authority, said Paul Dunn, executive director of the Pike Place
Market Merchants Association.
   The issue drew about 250 people last week to an emotional market
community meeting that lasted more than three hours. Several
suggested buying back the market, a prospect rejected by Malman and
Major.
   Market businesses _ 114 farmers, 230 artists and craftspeople
and 225 commercial tenants, including a day-care center, parrot
store, winery, legal and dental offices and the city's lone kosher
cafe _ have gross annual receipts of about $50 million, said
Michael Carroll, director of the market authority.
   He said operating profits are unlikely because of his agency's
mission _ providing social services such as a clinic for seniors,
serving as an incubator of small business and giving food and
farmers top priority _ and restrictions such as a historic review
commission's veto power over many tenants.
   Carroll also said the push for profits is the biggest threat to
the market since voters defeated a plan in 1971 that would have
razed most of the buildings for a hotel and convention center.
   Urban Group, meanwhile, is trying to assure merchants _ and
residents _ that their demand for more profits won't force a major
turnover in tenants.
   ``I think it's unrealistic to assume that the merchants could
pay much higher rents,'' Malman said.
   ``I like the tenants who are now in the market,'' Major said.
``I don't want to change that mix in any way.''

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz reportedly is being
treated for cancer.
   Goetz _ who became a symbol of crime fears in the city when he
shot four unarmed youths he said were threatening him on a subway
train _ revealed in court papers Monday he underwent ``major
surgery'' last month.
   The surgery and subsequent radiation treatments were for
testicular cancer, sources familiar with the case told the New York
Daily News and the New York Post. One testicle was removed, the
newspapers reported today.
   Goetz's attorney, Barry Slotnick, refused to give details of his
client's illness.
   ``Obviously, you can assume that he is not well,'' Slotnick
said, but added that Goetz was in good spirits after the operation.
   ``He is a very strong individual who has gone through a lot in
the past five years and will not allow his present unfortunate
physical condition to get him down,'' the attorney said.
   The shootings Dec. 22, 1984, ignited controversy over racial
tension and the rights of crime victims to defend themselves.
   Goetz, who is white, claimed the four black youths were trying
to rob him; the youths said they were panhandling.
   Goetz, 41, served eight months in prison for a weapons
conviction stemming from the shootings. He was acquitted of
attempted murder and assault.
   Darrell Cabey, who is paralyzed from the waist down from the
shooting, is suing Goetz for $50 million.
   The documents revealing Goetz's surgery were filed in court in
the Bronx to explain why he failed to appear for a deposition Dec.
1 with Cabey's attorneys.
   William Kunstler, one of Cabey's attorneys, said the news Goetz
had cancer didn't make him feel sympathy.
   ``It possibly makes me believe in God,'' Kunstler said.

<TEXT>
   A Chicago suburb has agreed to pay $650,000 to
the former owner of an apartment complex who contended he was
forced out of business for renting to too many blacks.
   George Cadar of Chicago charged in a lawsuit that the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development had foreclosed on his
complex in 1985 after Earl Bell, then president of the village of
University Park, wrote letters saying the unit was poorly managed
and rife with gang activity.
   Witnesses during the federal trial said Cadar had been singled
out because Bell believed he rented to too many blacks and because
Cadar was Bell's political rival.
   Testimony showed that no gang member had ever been arrested on
the apartment grounds and that the complex was well-maintained,
said Matthew Piers, Cadar's attorney.
   The jury Friday decided that Cadar's civil rights had been
violated and that Bell had caused HUD to foreclose on the 437-unit
complex, and it awarded Cadar $1.3 million.
   But under a settlement reached before the verdict was announced,
he agreed to accept no more than $650,000 if the village promised
not to appeal.
   Bell, president of the village of 6,300 from 1983 to 1985, said
Monday that HUD was justified in taking over the complex in 1985
because it was $10 million in debt.

   John Paul Stevens, the justice in a bow tie,
marches to his own drummer and appears not to care whether anyone
follows.
   Isolation often is the price he pays for intellectual
creativity; a Supreme Court leadership role that he has shunned
willingly since joining the court 14 years ago today.
   For all his years on the nation's highest court, lawyers, legal
scholars and court watchers have used the same words to describe
Stevens: ``maverick,'' ``wild card,'' even ``intellectual gadfly.''
   They also have used words such as ``brilliance'' and
``integrity.''
   ``He hasn't been a high-impact player,'' said Lawrence Marshall,
a Northwestern University law professor and former Stevens law
clerk.
   ``That which makes a leader on the court is not necessarily
intellectual acumen or integrity but an ability to engage in
politics with a small `p' _ a willingness to compromise and build a
consensus,'' Marshall said. ``Justice Stevens has always considered
his role to be judicial, not political.''
   James Simon, dean of the New York Law School, called Stevens
``the most independently minded and intellectually creative member
of the court, and a man of great integrity.''
   ``The benefit is that he always offers a fresh perspective,''
Simon said, ``but a downside, perhaps, is that he doesn't have much
of a following.''
   While the court's eight other members may disagree over how to
decide an issue, it is not rare for Stevens to file a concurring or
dissenting opinion that says another issue is what's really at the
heart of the matter.
   In ``The Ascent of Pragmatism,'' a new book on the court during
retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger's 17-year tenure, New York
University law school professor Bernard Schwartz makes the same
point.
   The book calls Stevens ``a loner (who) makes little effort to
win over other members of the court.''
   A pleasant, unassuming man with an affinity for wearing bow
ties, Stevens will turn 70 in April. He has found comfort in his
work and in the relative anonymity it provides. He refused to be
interviewed for this article, but answered several questions
submitted in writing.
   He said he enjoys a regular game of bridge (he's a life master)
and early morning tennis matches, and has not yet closed out his
avocation of flying as a licensed private pilot.
   Stevens' high court tenure began Dec. 19, 1975, after his
nomination by President Gerald R. Ford breezed through Senate
confirmation. He already had distinguished himself as a judge of
the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago after being
appointed to that job by President Richard M. Nixon in 1970.
   When in 1978 the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal
Communications Commission could ban the broadcast of ``indecent''
words even if they are not legally obscene, Stevens wrote for the
court:
   ``We simply hold that when the commission finds that a pig has
entered the parlor, the exercise of its regulatory power does not
depend on proof the pig is obscene.''
   Through the 1980s, Stevens served as something of a
self-appointed, in-house critic.
   His opinions occasionally chastised the court for deciding
certain cases more broadly than necessary, what he has called ``an
indefensible brand of judicial activism.''
   ``Judges who have confidence in their own ability to fashion
public policy are less hesitant to change the law than those of us
who are inclined to give wide latitude to the views of the voters'
representatives on non-constitutional matters,'' Stevens wrote in
dissenting from a securities law decision last May.
   Dissenting from a 1984 decision that reinstated a criminal
conviction, Stevens said, ``The court must be ever mindful of its
primary role as the protector of the citizen and not the warden or
the prosecution.''
   He said the court was spending too much time second-guessing
state court rulings that resulted in victories for individual
defendants.
   In most criminal law disputes and in other high-profile issues _
abortion, civil rights and church-state relations _ Stevens can be
found voting with the court's liberal wing.
   But when President Reagan's nomination of Robert H. Bork to the
court was foundering in 1987, Stevens took the unusual, and
unexpected, step of speaking out in favor of Bork.
   ``Surely he knew that once on the court Bork would not vote his
way in most cases,'' law professor Marshall said, ``but Justice
Stevens, in his own apolitical way, saw no reason to keep Bork off
the court.''
   ``Similarly, he repeatedly is the voice of conscience on how the
court wields its power,'' Marshall said. ``That flows from a strong
belief in the integrity of the court.''

   A businessman caught driving 75 mph in
a 50-mph zone has been fined a record $11,400, the Ilta-Sanomat

   Speeding fines are based on the offender's annual income. But
the managing director, who was not identified further, told police
when he was stopped in August that he had no fixed income.
   After checking with local authorities, police were told he
grossed $300,000 in 1987, the report said.
   The businessman lost an appeal when authorities confirmed his
1988 income also had been more than $300,000, excluding property
worth millions, Ilta-Sanomat said.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Communists May Split From Soviet Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lithuanian Communists today opened a
congress aimed at breaking off from the Soviet Communist Party and
declaring themselves an independent organization that will compete
in a multiparty system.
   Earlier this month, Lithuania become the first Soviet republic
to delete from its constitution the article enshrining the leading
role of the Communist Party.
   Lithuanian party leader Algirdas Brazauskas opened today's
meeting of more than 1,000 delegates declaring that: ``Only by
joint efforrts can we justify the people's trust.''
   Outside, several hundred Lithuanians gathered on the steps of
the opera and ballet theater where the congress was being held.
They carried red, green and yellow Lithuanian flags and banners
backing the party's proposed split.
   A small group of demonstrators marched down Gediminas Avenue,
the main street, to protest against even a reformed Communist
Party. One sign proclaimed, ``Stop Communism in Lithuania,'' with
the word ``Communism'' painted red to simulate dripping blood.
   The congress is to last most of the week and observers expect a
vote on the party's status to take place Wednesday or Thursday.
   One Lithuanian observer, Romas Gudaitis, wrote in today's
edition of the youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that
``Lithuania right now is like a volcano.''
   He said, ``the political tension has reached its culmination.''
   A draft declaration on the Lithuanian Communist Party's status
proclaims it to be part of the world Communist movement, but says
nothing about its relationship with the Soviet Communist Party.
   Lithuanian Communist Party leaders on Dec. 7 led the republic's
Parliament in striking Article 6 of the Lithuanian Constitution,
which had declared the Communist Party to be ``the leading force''
in Lithuanian society.
   Parliament directed that legislation be prepared to allow for
the registration of other political parties, a move toward
developing in Lithuania what lawmakers in Moscow have refused to
allow countrywide.
   The Lithuanian Communist leaders say they need to reform the
party and break its formal monopoly on power if they are to have
any chance of success in local elections, which are scheduled for
Feb. 24.
   The Lithuanian Communist Party has lost 10,000 members, or about
5 percent of its membership, this year, according to party
statistics.
   Soviet Communist Politburo member Vadim A. Medvedev was sent to
Vilnius three weeks ago with a message from President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev urging the Lithuanian Communists not to break from the
Soviet party.
   ``It must not be allowed, it is inadmissable now to follow the
path of splitting Communists on the basis of national or social
background,'' Gorbachev, who is also Communist Party leader, said
in the message delivered by Medvedev.
   Lithuanian Communist leaders were summoned to Moscow in
mid-November for a meeting with Soviet party's ruling Politburo on
the question of splitting from the Soviet Communist Party.

<TEXT>
   A judge has dismissed charges against
a 75-year-old anti-tax crusader accused of plotting earlier this
year to kill then-Mayor Henry Cisneros, ruling the defendant had
been entrapped.
   Parker Abell, 75, had been charged with solicitation of capital
murder, accused of offering a district attorney's investigator
$5,000 in May for Cisneros' slaying. Cisneros did not seek
re-election and left office in June.
   Defense attorney Steve Hilbig argued that it was investigator
John Veltkamp, not Abell, who was doing the persuading during their
videotaped meeting in May, and District Judge Mike Machado agreed
Monday that Abell was entrapped.
   ``It's an early Christmas present for Mr. Abell,'' said Hilbig,
a former assistant U.S. attorney seeking the Republican nomination
for district attorney.
   ``That's what they should have done,'' Abell told his lawyer and
the judge.
   Assistant District Attorney Julian Lopez said the law on
entrapment is broad and that there was room for other
interpretations, but he doubted prosecutors would pursue the case
against the cancer-stricken Abell, a retired railroad employee from
Natalia.
   ``I imagine that would be a factor in whether we appeal,'' Lopez
said. ``He's old. He's very sick.''
   Abell, who officials said had not paid taxes for 10 years, is a
one-time Libertarian candidate for Congress.
   Hilbig said he believes the investigation of Abell was initiated
by the Internal Revenue Service in 1988 after Abell called into a
radio talk show to complain about rising taxes.
   According to testimony, the IRS paid an informant $1,000 in
advance to develop information on Abell.

   Gov. Rose Mofford was reported in stable
condition this morning after surgery to remove her gallbladder.
   Her surgeon said there is an ``excellent chance'' the
67-year-old Democrat will be back on her feet in time to give her
State of the State address Jan. 8.
   St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center said in a statement
that she slept well overnight.
   Mrs. Mofford was hospitalized Sunday with chest pain. Tests
showed no heart trouble and discovered instead that she had a
gallbladder attack and had gallstones and an irritated pancreas.
The hour-long operation took place Monday.
   Dr. Victor Zannis, who performed the operation, said Mrs.
Mofford's pancreas is likely to heal itself. He predicted she would
be out of the hospital in five to 10 days ``if everything goes
well.''

<HEAD>NOW Cotton Bowl Parade Will Expose Too Many Legs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women is kicking up
a fuss over plans to lead off the Cotton Bowl Parade with 995 pairs
of women's legs.
   The local chapter is circulating a petition objecting to the use
of ``sex appeal and chauvinism'' in promoting the New Year's Day
parade, which will begin with members of the National Cheerleaders
Association Dance-Drill Team.
   ``We just want to raise awareness,'' local NOW spokeswoman Karen
Ashmore said Monday. ``We have valuable contributions to make to
society other than legs.''
   Paul Gleiser, executive director of the parade, called the
petition drive an overreaction.
   ``It's a parade,'' he said. ``It goes down the street and little
kids sitting on their dad's shoulders get excited.''
   ``Do we start eliminating these women from the parade?'' said H.
Ward Lay, chairman of the Cotton Bowl Parade Pageantry Committee.
``We just happen to be the parade that has the most beautiful women
in it, but we also just happen to be in the city that has the most
beautiful women in it, and the state, too.''
   ``If they're upset, I'm indeed sorry,'' Lay said. ``But the
parade will go on in its form and not be changed.''

<TEXT>
   Gunfire was reported early today in the
streets of a western Romanian city where witnesses say security
forces have shot and killed dozens of people in anti-government
rioting that began over the weekend.
   Unconfirmed reports have put the death toll at up to 400 and one
witness was quoted as saying he saw helicopters fire on crowds in
the city of Timisoara.
   Romania has virtually sealed its borders in an apparent attempt
to prevent details from emerging of the unrest, which a Hungarian
newspaper said had spread to two other Transylvanian cities _ Arad
and Brasov.
   The unrest is the most serious since November 1987 in the
country whose leaders have refused to stray from orthodox Communism.
   State-controlled Romanian media have made no mention of the
unrest, and Western reporters have been prevented from entering the
country. Most reports have come from travelers leaving Romania or
from news agencies able to reach residents by telephone.
   In Timisoara beginning on Saturday, thousands of people have
violently vented rage at hard-line President Nicolae Ceausescu for
his intolerance and the hardships he has forced Romanians to endure.
   Greek dental students, who had been attending school in the
city, said late Monday after crossing into Yugoslavia that they had
seen soldiers shoot indiscriminately at protesters, ``killing
dozens.''
   The students said they heard protesters shout ``Freedom!''
``Down with Ceausescu!'' and ``Bread!''
   A Western resident of Timisoara who crossed into Yugoslavia told
The Associated Press that the extent of the weekend violence was
``horrifying'' and that he saw several corpses on the streets.
   ``Tiananmen is nothing compared to Timisoara,'' he said,
speaking on condition he not be further identified. At least 500
people were killed in June when Chinese troops crushed the
pro-democracy movement in Beijing.
   Budapest radio said a caller from Timisoara _ 30 miles from the
Hungarian and Yugoslav borders _ this morning reported renewed
gunfire but that the phone then went dead.
   The radio quoted a Hungarian who said he had several physician
relatives working in Timisoara hospitals. He said he talked to them
by telephone and estimated from their reports that between 300 and
400 people were killed in the city by troops, with 250 bodies taken
to one hospital.
   About 20 percent of the dead and wounded were ethnic Hungarians,
others ethnic Romanians, he told the radio.
   That would substantiate other accounts trickling out of the
country that the protest grew from a few hundred ethnic Hungarians
defending a local pastor into a massive demonstration against
Ceausescu's harsh policies.
   Romania's crackdown drew protest from other countries including
Hungary, which has long been at odds with Bucharest over the
treatment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarian minority in Romania,
most of whom live in Transylvania.
   A Yugoslav who said he traveled to Timisoara Saturday night was
quoted as telling the Belgrade daily Politika that crowds in the
city were fired on from helicopters.
   ``I was stopped at approach to Timisoara by soldiers, holding
guns at point-blank range, but they let me through,'' Radoslav
Dencic was quoted by the daily as saying.
   ``The same night bursts of automatic weapon fire could be
heard,'' he said. ``Crowds were even shot at from helicopters.''
   A Yugoslav trucker, Frank Zemberi, said he passed through
Timisoara early Tuesday and saw two large fires raging in distant
parts of town.
   ``Countless'' tanks were parked on the outskirts of Timisoara,
Zemberi said, but the city itself appeared calm, with five armored
vehicles parked in the center and a number of police vans cruising
the streets.
   A Yugoslav traveler said Monday he saw two people killed in
Timisoara. Traffic into Romania was virtually halted on the
Yugoslav, Hungarian and Bulgarian borders, and Austrians and West
Germans were informed that, with few exceptions, they were not
allowed to enter.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said Monda that security forces
had taken full control in Timisoara, Romania's fourth-largest city
with 350,000 residents.
   Hungary's Radio Kossuth quoted an unnamed resident of the city
as saying things were calm during the day, ``but at night it's like
during the war.
   ``All main intersections have roadblocks, everybody is stopped
and checked and people are not allowed to leave town except in
extreme cases,'' the radio quoted the resident as saying.
   The Hungarian daily Magyar Hirlap today quoted unidentified
truck drivers as saying Arad, some 60 miles north of Timisoara,
``is ringed with tanks and traffic is detoured.'' It asserted
without any specifics that there were also clashes in Arad and
Brasov.
   Col. Janos Pal of the Hungarian border guards was quoted as
saying crowds in Curtic, between Arad and Timisoara, broke into
local Communist Party headquarters on Sunday and burned documents.
   In a broadcast Monday on West Germany's Radio Bremen, William
Toetoek, an ethnic German writer from Romania, quoted witnesses in
Timisoara as saying between 300 and 400 demonstrators were killed
in the unrest.
   The bloody clashes were a sign of contempt for Ceausescu, who
has ruled Romania since 1965, stifling dissent with a vast secret
police force and stubbornly resisting reform.
   While other East bloc countries end or relax one-party Communist
rule, Ceausescu's government has maintained strict control of
society and the economy and continues to harass and jail its
critics.
   Ceausescu's crash industrialization programs and drive to repay
the country's entire $11 billion foreign debt have caused
widespread shortages and rationing of basic foods.
   The unrest was the most serious since a protest march by 10,000
workers in Brasov in November 1987. Ceausescu did not comment on it
and on Monday traveled to Iran for a state visit. His his wife,
Elena, the second most powerful person in the country, stayed
behind.
   The unrest apparently began after hundreds of members of the
country's ethnic Hungarian minority formed a ``human chain'' Friday
to prevent the attempted eviction of the Rev. Laszlo Toekes, who
has championed their rights, said Mihnea Berindei, vice chairman of
the Paris-based Romanian League for Human Rights.
   The Protestant clergyman, harassed for months by authorities for
defending ethnic Hungarians against alleged official
discrimination, took refuge with his wife in his church on Nov. 2
after masked assailants tried to attack him, Berindei said. He said
Toekes' whereabouts were not known Monday evening.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Mudar Badran told the new
Parliament today his government will lift martial law, which for 22
years has banned large public meetings and allowed authorities to
restrict freedom of speech.
   Badran, seeking a vote of confidence from the newly elected
legislature, added that until martial law is formally revoked most
of its provisions will be ``frozen'' effective immediately.
   He also vowed his administration will crack down on corruption
by public officials and criticized former governments for deficit
spending that swelled Jordan's $8.3 billion foreign debt.
   Under martial law, which King Hussein imposed after the 1967
Arab-Israeli war, authorities also can close newspapers at any
time, effectively inhibiting free criticism of officials. It also
provides for special courts.
   Most candidates in last month's general elections called for the
lifting of martial law and many demanded the legalization of
political parties, which currently are banned.
   Badran said a constitutional court will be formed to secure
citizens' rights as stipulated by the constitution.
   He lifted legal immunity from government officials and said he
would put forward legislation requiring an officeholder to present
``a comprehensive and documented report of all his possessions.''
   The announcement of such a financial disclosure requirement was
aimed at ensuring the integrity of public officials.
   The government of Prime Minister Zeid Rifai, which resigned
earlier this year after bloody rioting, was widely accused of
corruption.
   The largest bloc in the new lower house is made up of Islamic
fundamentalists or their sympathizers.
   ``I announce in this Parliament that martial law is now
considered frozen ... until such laws are constitutionally
abolished in the near future,'' Badran told the lower house of
Parliament.
   It was the latest in a series of moves towards democracy and
liberalization announced by the king and by Badran's government,
which was formed Dec. 6.
   The lower house has to approve all laws and has the power to
throw out prime ministers and their Cabinets. Still, King Hussein
can block any laws in the royally appointed Senate or through a
veto, and he has frequently used the power to dissolve Parliament
and rule by decree.
   Last month, Hussein promised a ``gradual reduction'' in the
activities of the martial law courts and said their
responsibilities would be transfered to civil courts.
   On Dec. 10, Badran announced his government would return
confiscated passports and promised further amnesties for political
prisoners, after 48 were released by the previous government.
   He told Parliament then that he ordered authorities to give all
Jordanian citizens freedom of movement and the right to work, in
accordance with the king's instructions.
   Badran said he did not know how many passports had been
confiscated, but security sources said the number was more than
8,700. Many of those whose passports were confiscated had said
security officials intervened to bar them from jobs.
   The November elections were the first nationwide poll since 1967
when Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan. Hussein last year
renounced Jordan's claim to the West Bank in favor of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The fundamentalist Moslem Brotherhood Movement captured the most
seats in the lower house of Parliament _ 25 out of a total of 80 _
but Badran earlier this month formed a government without the
movement that advocates stricter Islamic laws.
   By law, the new 23-member Cabinet has to appear before lower
house for a vote of confidence within 30 days. If approved by a
simple majority of 41 votes, the government will be installed. If
not, King Hussein will have to name a new prime minister.

<TEXT>
   The Communist premier today urged
the Communist-dominated Parliament to elect opposition leader
Vaclav Havel for president by the end of the year.
   ``It is the government's opinion that there is no alternative
... than to elect Vaclav Havel as president,'' Premier Marian Calfa
told deputies in the Federal Assembly. They applauded the
recommendation.
   Thousands of students gathered early today around the statue of
St. Wenceslas with banners, balloons and red, white and blue
Czechoslovak flags for pro-Havel demonstrations. Some students, who
arrived early on trains and buses from throughout the country,
passed the time before the demonstrations by Christmas shopping
along Wenceslas Square.
   Calfa's recommendation and its reception by the deputies
appeared to signal the final victory of the peaceful revolution,
which in one month has swept away 41 years of Communist domination
of Czechoslovakia's government.
   The pro-democracy opposition has negotiated a new non-Communist
government that includes two former dissidents; ousted hard-line
Communist President Gustav Husak; and introduced reforms in every
political, social and religious sphere.
   Support has been snowballing for Havel, who would be the first
non-Communist to hold the office in 41 years. Husak resigned Dec.
10.
   Havel's only rivals are former Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec
and Alexander Dubcek, who led the reforms of the ``Prague Spring''
in 1968 and was removed by the Kremlin. Dubcek, who enjoys
tremendous support in his native Slovakia, has been waffling on
whether he is in the race.
   Cestmir Cisar, the students' candidate for president in 1968 and
an unofficial contender in the current race, withdrew Monday night
and threw his support behind Havel.
   Czechoslovakia's constitution requires Parliament to elect a new
president within two weeks of a vacancy occurring, but Communist
and opposition leaders agreed to introduce a resolution to extend
the deadline.
   The two-point agenda approved at the start of today's meeting
would give them until late January to choose a president. It was
unclear when a vote on the extension would be taken.
   Calfa said a president should be chosen before the year ends in
12 days.
   ``The government is making efforts to solve the political and
constitutional crisis,'' Calfa said. ``We want to ask the Federal
Assembly to contribute to this effort by electing the president by
the end of this year.''
   Josef Bartoncik, head of the lower house of the bicameral
Parliament and leader of the People's Party, said his party would
support Havel and would recommend that Parliament recovene Dec. 28
or Dec. 29 to elect the president.
   The Socialist Party, one of four small parties in the
Communist-dominated Parliament, also endorsed Havel.
   Deputies also were considering the government's reform program,
which outlines political and economic changes, repudiates the
repression that followed the 1968 anti-reform crackdown, and
supports a democratic socialism.
   Meanwhile, opposition leaders said reports of a planned military
coup were spread to cause uncertainty. Opposition member Sasha
Vondra was quoted as saying in the Svobodne Slovo daily that the
rumor of an impending coup ``is purposefully propagated
disinformation and rumor.''
   Representatives from the Civic Forum met Monday with Defense
Minister Miroslav Vacek who assured them the army supported
democratic reform, he said.
   Col. Stanislav Pohoral, a Defense Ministry spokesman, condemned
the circulation of ``leaflets, mainly in Brno, which say a ...
military coup is being planned,'' calling it ``totally
irresponsible.''
   The army leadership ``distances itself from these actions and
rejects the accusations,'' he said.

   Supporters of socialist presidential
candidate Luis Inacio da Silva refused to concede defeat and
accused the nation's biggest television network and private bus
companies of sabotaging their campaign.
   The official tally today had conservative free-market advocate
Fernando Collor de Mello leading da Silva by 2.46 million votes,
with 90.36 percent of the ballots counted in Brazil's first direct
presidential election in 29 years.
   The winner could be announced this afternoon, Superior Electoral
Court spokesman Irineu Tamanini said. Final results will be known
by Wednesday, he said.
   Out-going President Jose Sarney said he would step down from
office early if Congress voted to shorten his five-year mandate.
   ``If the Congress wishes, I won't be an obstacle,'' said Sarney,
a civilian who took office in 1985 to end a 21-year right-wing
military regime. Sarney was chosen in an Electoral College vote
coordinated by Brazil's top generals.
   The new president is scheduled to succeed Sarney for a five-year
term March 15. However, pressure is mounting for Sarney to resign
early to allow the new president to adopt emergency economic
measures.
   News of Collor de Mello's lead stabilized financial markets
Monday and triggered a plunge of the dollar on the illegal, but
tolerated, black market.
   Globo TV, the nation's biggest network, on Monday projected
Collor de Mello would defeat da Silva by 6.27 percent of total
votes cast.
   The conservative candidate led by 3 million votes, or 5.1
percent of valid ballots, in the network's unofficial tally, which
was based on 86.8 percent of returns announced by state election
officials.
   The owner of Globo TV, media tycoon Roberto Marinho, supported
Collor de Mello during the campaign.
   Officials of da Silva's Workers Party said they would sue the
network, accusing it of giving Collor de Mello more television time
in news broadcasts in the days leading up to the vote.
   The party officials also accused the network of portraying the
conservative candidate in a more favorable light than his leftist
adversary.
   All TV time during Brazilian elections is strictly controlled by
the Supreme Electoral Court.
   ``We'll follow this to the last vote and show the Court how much
Globo TV influenced the election's outcome,'' said Workers Party
President Luiz Gushiken.
   Federal Police Chief Romeu Tuma said officials were
investigating charges by the Workers Party that voters couldn't
reach polling stations in the states of Bahia and Ceara _ both
strong da Silva regions _ because private bus companies pulled
their vehicles off the streets.
   Collor de Mello, 40, advocates free-market policies and moral
cleanup in government. He says Brazil's $110 billion foreign debt,
the largest in the Third World, should be paid, but under less
burdensome conditions.
   Brazil's business, military and media establishments have closed
ranks behind Collor de Mello, who comes from a prominent family in
the northeastern state of Alagoas, long established in politics.
   The Marxist-oriented de Silva, 44, has ured immediate suspension
of payments on the foreign debt, and advocates sweeping land, urban
reform and the redistribution of income.
   Brazilians on Sunday cast ballots to choose a successor to
President Jose Sarney for a five-year term in a historic vote
marking the return of democratic rights after 21 years of military
rule. The country of 150 million people has 82 million registered
voters.
   Sarney is a civilian but gained office through a
military-coordinated Electoral College vote in 1985.
   Da Silva was bouyed early in the official count by returns from
the major southern cities of Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, his
main strongholds.
   But Collor de Mello overtook da Silva when returns came in from
remote central and northern regions, where the conservative had an
edge.
   Collor de Mello appeared briefly Monday afternoon outside his
Brasilia mansion, waving and making a victory sign. He made no
comment on the count to reporters.
   Da Silva and Collor de Mello were the top vote-getters in a
field of 21 candidates in first-round balloting Nov. 15. Neither
obtained a majority needed to win so the runoff was held.

   A spectacular fire fed by oil-soaked
wood floors burned a converted 126-year-old mill complex today in
the biggest blaze in Providence history, officials said. Three
firefighters suffered minor injuries.
   Up to 150 firefighters _ every one in the city and some from
Rhode Island and Massachusetts _ battled the blaze in 17-degree
weather. The fire gutted six of nine buildings in the complex,
which had been converted to shops and other businesses.
   Fire Chief Michael F. Moise said it was ``the most extensive
area of fire that we've ever seen in the city of Providence.''
   The fire was declared under control about 1:30 a.m., eight hours
after it began, but Moise said it could take three days to douse
the hot spots at the complex of two- and four-story brick buildings
spread over a quarter-mile.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known.
   ``The floors were pretty well-oiled,'' said Fire Department
spokesman Larry Donahue. ``They had machines that sat on those
floors for years, and they were oiled every day over a period of
100 years or so. That makes them more flammable.''

   Parliament put the government through its first
no-confidence vote today over an economic reform plan that retains
heavy central planning, but Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his
ministers easily survived.
   In the dramatic confrontation, the normally sophisticated
Ryzhkov's voice cracked with emotion as he pleaded for support.
Progressives have criticized his economic package as inadequate to
the task of ending a grave economic crisis.
   They say it doesn't go far enough to overhaul a plodding
bureaucractic system and encourage greater productivity and
efficiency by embracing free market mechanisms.
   ``The Congress should not avoid making an evaluation. It must
express its firm position: either to support the government's
proposals, of course considering the remarks made here, or some
other formulation,'' Ryzhkov told the 2,250 members of the Congress
of People's Deputies, the Soviet Parliament.
   After his appeal, the no-confidence motion was rejected by tally
of 1,685 to 199 with 99 abstentions. The ruling Communists hold 87
percent of the chamber's seats.
   Yuri Andreev, a parliamentarian from Moscow, proposed the
no-confidence vote after a heated debate in which progressives
attacked the government plan as inadequate to the task of effective
reform.
   Ryzhkov's plan shifts traditional central planning from an
emphasis on heavy industry to consumer goods. It speaks of
developing a market but says little about concrete measures for
freeing products from the iron control of ministries for free sale
on the market.
   Andreev urged Parliament to express its lack of confidence in
the government by asking it to draft a new economic reform plan and
to fire the officials who drafted the original version.
   Just before the vote, Ryzhkov took the floor and in an emotional
statement with a cracking voice, rejected a proposal that the plan
merely be taken into consideration and asked for a straight yes or
no vote.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who was presiding over the
session, agreed that Parliament should take a firm decision. But,
he added that congressional committees would consider changes in
the plan suggested by the deputies.
   ``It's a political question: Will we support this government,
that which it introduced, or will we keep the government in such a
state all the time that it cannot start its work?'' Gorbachev asked.
   The vote on approving the economic plan was 1,532 to 419, with
44 abstensions. Ryzhkov stood and clasped his hands in an
expression of victory as deputies applauded approval of the plan.
   In Sunday's Sovietskaya Rossiya newspaper, Ryzhkov implied he
would resign if the deputies did not accept his economic proposal.
   Asked what would happen if the program did not pass, Ryzhkov
said, ``Then other people will work it out. Then, it will not be
Ryzhkov going to the rostrum, but somebody else.
   ``I am responsible for my program, I believe in it, and I will
never deny anything that is signed by me. If I ever feel fear, then
there is no place for me in the government.''
   In other action, the leadership failed to muster the required
majority to alter the constitution to allow the Communist Party and
other officially approved organizations to continue to fill a third
of the Congress seats themselves. The current Constitution
guarantees a third of the seats to those groups.

   FBI agents intent on arresting suspected Soviet
spy Felix Bloch attempted to turn his family against him, his
daughter says.
   ``They wanted my mother as the star witness. They were grasping
at straws _ they were desperate,'' Andrea Bloch, 26, said in
today's New York Post. The agents threatened to charge her mother,
Lucille Bloch, as a co-conspirator, Ms. Bloch charged.
   ``They were trying to pressure my father into breaking by using
us,'' she said. ``They wanted to make us so miserable that it would
make him miserable.''
   The FBI's plan ``totally backfired,'' she said, despite the
strains it put on the family.
   Bloch, once the No. 2 man in the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, was
followed by FBI agents for months after he was videotaped
purportedly passing a briefcase to a Soviet official in Vienna.
   The surveillance has been scaled back recently, and Bloch has
never been charged with any crime.

<HEAD>Reagan Ambassador to Beijing Condemns Scowcroft Mission</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winston Lord, a career diplomat who served as
President Reagan's ambassador to China, today denounced President
Bush's decision to send emissaries to Beijing as a ``severely
misguided'' step that will make the United States appear weak to
China's leaders.
   ``One does not shore up the long-term foundations for
Sino-American relations by appearing weak to China's leaders and
callous to the Chinese and American people,'' Lord said in a signed
column in today's Washington Post.
   ``One does not earn respect abroad by reversing field within
months and practicing double standards,'' he said.
   Lord's piece was written before the White House's disclosure on
Monday that Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, and
Lawrence Eagleburger, the deputy secretary of state, secretly
visited Beijing on Bush's orders in July.
   Scowcroft and Eagleburger also visited China earlier this month.
The White House announced that visit after they arrived in Beijing.
   Lord served in Beijing as U.S. ambassador from 1985 to 1989. He
was a special assistant to Henry Kissinger when Kissinger first
visited China in 1971 and served as a special assistant to the
president for national security affairs in the Nixon White House.
   Bush has come under criticism from Democrats and Republicans
alike for the Scowcroft mission, which was undertaken despite the
president's pledge to break off high-level contacts until China's
leaders acted to repair the damage done in the Tiananmen Square
massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators last June.
   In an interview Monday, Bush said any suggestion that his
actions amounted to condoning the repression in China was ``not a
good rap, and it's not true.''
   Lord said in seeking improved ties with China the administration
forfeited the right to censure it on moral grounds. ``But even on
its own terms the Scowcroft mission was severely misguided,'' he
said, arguing it undermined China's ``closet modererates.''
   ``Far from strengthening their hand, the admninistration has
robbed them of the argument that Chinese repression and xenophobia
entail costs,'' he wrote. ``Japan, Europe and others will feel free
to follow the Scowcroft trail.''
   The former ambassador said that while censure might not
influence China's hard-line leaders, ``international acquiescence''
in the Tiananmen shootings ``surely reinforces their view that
crushing their populace elicits only fleeting outcries, no lasting
repercussions.''
   Lord was especially critical of Scowcroft's toast during the
Dec. 8 visit. He said Scowcroft ``lined up the administration with
the Beijing regime against the Chinese and American people'' when
he said, ``In both our societies there are voices of those who seek
to redirect or frustrate our cooperation. We both must take bold
measures to overcome these negative forces.''
   Lord contrasted those words with what Secretary of State James
Baker said two days later in Berlin: ``True stability requires
governments with legitimacy, governments that are based on the
consent of the governed.''

   A U.S. military officer killed last Saturday
night by Panamanian troops has been identified as Marine 1st Lt.
Robert Paz, 25, of Dallas.
   A Pentagon spokeswoman, Army Maj. Kathy Wood, said today that
Paz was assigned to the Marine Corps Security Force Company at the
U.S. Navy's Rodman facility in Panama. His parents were identified
as Mr. and Mrs. Jaime Paz of Cali, Colombia. The Washington Times
said his father was believed to be a Colombian citizen and his
mother an American.
   Panamanian authorities contended that Paz and three other U.S.
officers were in a car that ran a checkpoint and that the Americans
wounded a Panamanian soldier and two civilians.
   The U.S. Southern Command said they were fleeing a crowd of
Panamanian soldiers and people in civilian clothes when the
Panamanians opened fire.

<HEAD>Marshals Screening Packages Mailed to Courthouses After Mail-Bombings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal marshals examined packages delivered
to U.S. courthouses and officials briefly evacuated a Justice
Department corridor today in the wake of mail-bomb killings of an
appellate judge in Alabama and a lawyer in Savannah, Ga.
   The nation's federal judges were advised to let the U.S.
marshals inspect any package mailed to their chambers, even those
bearing a familiar return address.
   Judges were told ``to bring all packages to the attention of the
marshals so they can be screened and X-rayed before opening,'' said
William Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service in Washington.
   The advisory also applies to packages bearing familiar names
because ``return addresses can be forged or faked,'' Dempsey said.
   At the Justice Department, security officials briefly evacuated
offices along a section of a first-floor corridor when a suspicious
package addressed to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh turned up in
the basement mailroom, officials said.
   Employees were allowed to return to their offices 10 minutes
later after officials determined the parcel was not dangerous.
After X-raying the package, security officials determined it
contained a pen set for the attorney general, said Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel.
   ``We're being more vigilant,'' said Flavio Lorenzoni, Chief
Deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of New York. ``All
packages are being checked carefully.''
   Lorenzoni, like colleagues elsewhere across the country,
declined to discuss specific security precautions taken since the
assassination of Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance, who was killed
Saturday by a package bomb sent to his home outside Birmingham, Ala.
   Authorities also were investigating a mailed bomb that killed
Savannah, Ga., attorney Robert Robinson, who was a city alderman
and black civil rights activist. Robinson died Monday night after
undergoing emergency surgery for injuries he received in the blast
in his office several hours earlier, officials said.
   Just as security was being redoubled Monday at many federal
courthouses across the country, another package bomb turned up at
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta.
   The bomb was found in a package during a screening of mail sent
to the courthouse, which is the headquarters of the 11th Circuit,
on which Vance sat.
   In Miami, Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal James Tassone said packages
and mail entering the federal courthouses in that city as well as
in Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach were being X-rayed.
   Extra inspections of people entering the courthouses also were
being conducted by guards, he said. Some courthouse employees were
asked to empty their pockets as they passed through metal detectors.
   Officials in other courthouses reported that security was
already tight and didn't need to be upgraded.
   But Deputy Marshal Jeff Whitney in Evansville, Ind., said judges
were instructed not to open any uninspected packages.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
discussed the Vance assassination with Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh, who reported that investigators ``have not reached any
conclusions'' about the case.
   ``We just don't have any answers yet as to who might have done
it to him,'' Fitzwater said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama today accused the United
States of ``arrogance'' in two recent confrontations that left an
American Marine officer dead and a Panamanian policeman wounded.
   The latest incident occurred Monday, when a U.S. Army lieutenant
shot and wounded a Panamanian police officer. At the time, U.S.
forces were on high alert following a Saturday shooting, with
President Bush refusing to rule out military action against the
government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The general's Defense Forces on Monday called the shooting of
the policeman an ``ever more reckless aggression'' by the United
States and accused U.S. officials of twisting the facts of the case.
   The American involved was leaving a laundry in western Panama
City when the policeman motioned to him to stop and approached him,
according to the U.S. Southern Command. It said the policeman
appeared to reach for a gun.
   ``The American responded defensively by pulling a weapon and
fired two shots,'' the U.S. statement said. ``The Panamanian went
down, then got up and left the scene.''
   Panama, however, said the American was traveling in a vehicle
that ``never stopped and on the contrary, accelerated.''
   One of the two shots hit policeman Cesar Tejada in the left
forearm, a Defense Forces communique said.
   The civilian laundry, under contract to clean U.S. military
uniforms, is near Southern Command headquarters and less than a
mile from Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.
   Tensions already were high over Saturday's fatal shooting of
Marine 1st Lt. Robert Paz, 25, of Dallas, and the reported beating
of a Navy couple who U.S. officials say witnessed the shooting.
   The government-owned newspaper Critica today called the two
incidents ``epileptic arrogance'' by the United States and lashed
out at the ``cynicism to blame the Defense Forces for the criminal
actions of Saturday when four U.S. soldiers fired on civilians and
defenseless women.''
   U.S. forces stayed on maximum alert but took no public action
other than to patrol their bases in battle gear. Traffic and
business in Panama City was normal today.
   Since Noriega was indicted on cocaine trafficking charges in
Florida in February 1988 the United States has tried through
economic, diplomatic and political pressure to drive him from power.
   The Panamanian leader claims the U.S. drug charges, which he
denies, are part of a plot by Washington to renege on the 1977
Panama Canal treaties, which cede control of the waterway at the
end of the century.
   Panama says Paz _ and three others with him Saturday _ ran a
checkpoint and wounded a Panamanian soldier and two civilians. The
Southern Command said they were fleeing a crowd of Panamanian
soldiers and people in civilian clothes when the Panamanians opened
fire.
   Photographs viewed by The Associated Press of the 1981 Chevrolet
with Michigan plates in which the Americans were riding showed
bullet holes, including two on the driver's side and one through
the trunk.
   U.S. officers said the shots came from Soviet-made AK-47 rifles.
   ``This is the most serious incident we have had,'' a U.S.
Command spokesman said. ``This involved a loss of life. No course
of action is being ruled out as a response.''
   ``We are trying to be rational in our response. We are going to
take a calculated plan of action. The U.S. government does not
respond without thinking results through.''
   He spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the Noriega
government's recent declaration of a ``state of war'' with the
United States ``may have been a license for harassment and threats
and in this case murder.''
   Lt. Col. Arnulfo Castrejon Garcia, the Panamanian navy chief,
said the two military forces were communicating by messenger about
the incidents. A U.S. military source said there had been no
``negotiations.''
   He said Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of the U.S. Army
South, had demanded an explanation of the American officer's death
and threatened to invade Panama.
   A Southern Command spokesman declined to comment on Castrejon's
version.
   Panama's Defense Forces sent U.S. military officials a letter
that did not explain the shooting but demanded that U.S. forces
``exercise maximum prudence to avoid unfortunate incidents.''
   Castrejon also denied that the U.S. Navy couple was mistreated,
but confirmed they were arrested.
   ``At no time any of our defense forces threaten, intimidate or
much less torture any citizen, much less if he is a foreigner or an
American,'' he said.

   Government leaders and newspapers
throughout Europe, displaying rare unison across East-West borders,
today denounced the Romanian government for its bloody repression
of weekend protests.
   Scores, perhaps hundreds, of people were reported killed when
Romanian security forces crushed anti-government demonstrations on
Saturday and Sunday, according to unconfirmed reports. Gunfire was
said to have also been heard today in Timisoara, 30 miles from the
Yugoslav border.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, at a session with
some 200 members of the European Parliament in Brussels, said that
if reports of bloodshed are true, ``I can only express my very
profound regret.
   ``We are categorically opposed to the use of force,''
Shevardnadze said.
   There was no comment in Beijing, where the Chinese government
crushed a peaceful pro-democracy movement with tanks on June 4-5.
   In its first protest to another Soviet bloc country, the
Bulgarian government today expressed ``serious concern'' to the
Romanian Embassy in Sofia over the unilateral closure of the border.
   Romania closed its borders to all visitors, allowing in only
diplomats and others with official papers.
   Foreign ministers of the 12 European Community nations denounced
the violence to suppress the demonstrations. Several governments
summoned Romanian diplomats to protest.
   In Brussels, the 12 foreign ministers said in a statement the
regime of President Nicolae Ceausescu was ``turning its back on all
the commitments concerning human rights to which it has
subscribed.''
   In Poland, both Parliament and Nobel Prize winner Lech Walesa
unanimously denounced the human rights abuses and demanded Romania
stop the violence.
   The British government summoned Romanian Ambassador Stan Soare
to protest ``in the strongest possible terms'' about the violent
crackdown.
   A spokesman said Soare responded to the British protest by
``resorting to the tired old formula of alleging interference in
Romania's internal affairs.''
   ``We urgently called upon the Romanian government to end
policies of repression and allow their citizens to exercise their
fundamental human rights,'' the Foreign Office said.
   In neighboring Hungary, feelings ran high because as many as 1.7
million ethnic Hungarians live in Transylvania in the western part
of Romania.
   ``Anachronistic regimes opposed to progress cannot remain in
place'' if Europe is to be united, liberal Hungarian Premier Miklos
Nemeth said.
   ``History has already witnessed the reign of regimes, not so
long ago, that showed off their strength with tanks before being
overthrown by the rage of the people,'' the Hungarian Socialist
Party newspaper Nepszabadsag said.

<TEXT>
   An obstetrician convicted of infanticide
after witnesses said he let an aborted fetus die was placed on
three years' probation today and ordered to perform 300 hours of
community service.
   Dr. Joseph Melnick, 66, was found guilty in a non-jury trial in
June, the first criminal prosecution under Pennsylvania's 1974
abortion law, which requires doctors to do what they can if they
remove a living fetus.
   Common Pleas Judge Lynn Abraham heeded Melnick's plea for
leniency, calling what he did a ``criminal mistake'' for which
neither jail nor a heavy fine was appropriate. She also said she
had no intention of making an example of him.
   The mistake, the judge said, was that the doctor performed an
abortion on a teen-ager in her eighth month of pregnancy. The
doctor said he had been told she was in her fourth or fifth month.
State law prohibits most abortions after six months, but Melnick
was not charged with performing an illegal abortion.
   ``I am very sorry that this unfortunate incident occurred,''
Melnick told the judge. ``Please do not judge me by this one
incident alone.''
   The judge ordered Melnick perform his community service in
medical facilities. He could have received 3{ to 7 years in prison.
Assistant District Attorney David Webb had asked for a jail term
and a fin.
   Witnesses, including nurses at West Park Hospital, where the
1984 abortion on a 13-year-old was performed, had said that the
fetus survived about 90 minutes and moved and gasped but that
Melnick ordered that no care be given. Melnick contended the
3-pound, 9-ounce girl was stillborn.
   The doctor is still practicing. State licensing authorities are
expected to take up the case.
   Defense attorney Richard Sprague said he would appeal on grounds
the verdict was not justified by the evidence.
   Melnick originally was charged with murder, but the charge was
dismissed on grounds of insufficient evidence, and the abortion law
was invoked.

<TEXT>
   The Berlin Wall will be opened
before Christmas at the Brandenburg Gate, the towering monument
viewed by many as a symbol of German unity, East German Premier
Hans Modrow said today.
   The announcement followed a meeting between Modrow and West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, during which the two leaders
discussed the thorny issue of how to bring the long-divided nations
closer together.
   Since the Berlin Wall started crumbling early last month,
Germans in both East and West have demanded an opening at the gate
to demonstrate the new era of improved relations between the
countries.
   Modrow told reporters the new opening for pedestrians will be
created before Monday. And the date for visa-free travel by West
Germans and West Berliners to East Germany will be moved up from
Jan. 1 to Dec. 24, in time for Christmas and New Year.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe today:
   _Former Czechoslovak dissident Vaclav Havel received an
endorsement for president from the Communist premier, Marian Calfa.
   _Hungarian radio reported that gunfire rang out early today in
the streets of the Romanian city of Timisoara, where bloody clashes
between security forces and anti-government protesters reportedly
left dozens dead last weekend.
   _Yugoslavia's premier suffered a blow after the nation's largest
republic, Serbia, flatly rejected his key reform program that would
introduce market mechanisms into the ailing economy.
   The summit highlighted the debate raging over German
reunification, which Kohl supports and Modrow opposes.
   Chants of ``Helmut! Helmut!'' and ``Germany, united
fatherland!'' rose from the crowd of at least 5,000 that lined the
streets as Kohl's motorcade of black Mercedes limousines carried
him to the meeting at the Hotel Bellevue.
   Workers in hard hats left work to catch a glimpse of the
chancellor, and West German flags and banners calling for German
unity formed a sea of red, black and gold.
   But there were signs of opposition to Kohl's pro-reunification
stance.
   ``A Fourth Reich _ Is that why you stayed behind?'' said one
poster on a fence in the city center. It referred to those East
Germans who have declined to emigrate to wealthy West Germany,
choosing instead to stay behind and help rebuild their troubled
socialist state.
   With the ruins of war-ravaged buildings visible in the distance,
Modrow told reporters his first talks with Kohl marked a ``new
beginning'' in relations between the countries. Kohl accepted an
offer to start negotiations on a treaty to improve relations, and
negotiations will start ``immediately,'' Modrow said.
   Kohl told reporters he hopes such a treaty can be signed by late
spring.
   He later walked through a crowd of several thousand people.
Several signs called for German reunification, with one saying
``Helmut and Hans, make us into one Germany.''
   At an outdoor rally, Kohl drew wild cheers when he referred to
the crowd as ``compatriots'' and said, ``We will not abandon you.''
   ``The emotions are nice, but we have to see what the reality
is,'' he said on West Germany's ZDF television.
   Kohl said he and Modrow would meet again at the end of January
or the beginning of February.
   He said the two sides ``got closer on some issues,'' citing the
East German push for a more formal relationship between the two
states.
   The summit was held in Dresden because West Germany refuses to
acknowledge East Berlin as the capital of a separate and sovereign
East German state.
   East Germany has been seeking a ``Treaty Community,''
establishing fuller ties between East and West Germany, rather than
working to join them.
   Kohl has proposed a 10-point plan aimed at eventual German
reunification.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze today reiterated
Soviet concerns about reunification during a speech to members of
the European Parliament in Belgium, saying there are two good
reasons to oppose it:
   ``We (the Soviet Union) paid the price of 20 million lives for
the existing European stability,'' he said of World War II.
``Furthermore, can the German people themselves forget the national
tragedy brought onto them by Hitlerism?''
   Kohl has made clear that his conservative-led government seeks
eventual reunification of the two German states that have been
divided since 1945.
   But Modrow and many other East Germans active in the
increasingly fragmented political arena have said joining the two
states would be destabilizing for Europe and would result in a
``sellout'' of East German land and industry.
   Reunification has become a major topic of public debate and a
political football in both Germanies ever since a massive popular
uprising forced East Germany to open its borders Nov. 9 and led to
a crumbling of Communist control.
   East Germany's first free elections are now set for May 6.
   Chants of ``Germany, united fatherland'' occasionally disrupted
a candlelight vigil in Leipzig on Monday night. The silent march
was called by church and reform leaders in memory of the victims of
Stalinism.
   The words ``Germany, united fatherland'' were originally part of
the East German national anthem but have been excised since the
early 1970s when Communist officials dropped reunification as a
goal.

   A woman faked a kidnapping of her two children in
a scheme to get $12,000 ``ransom'' from her husband and then leave
him, police said.
   Arazelia Delgadillo, 27, was freed Monday on $200 bail on
charges of falsifying a police report, which carries up to six
months in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Ms. Delgadillo on Saturday told police her 2-year-old and
4-year-old boys had been taken along with her car while she was
inside a grocery store.
   Police, following instructions from Ms. Delgadillo, set up a
ransom drop Sunday, but the ``kidnappers'' never showed,
authorities said.
   Later Sunday, FBI agents traced a phone call made to the woman's
home and found the children at an apartment where Ms. Delgadillo's
14-year-old brother was living, police said.
   ``She thought her husband would just go to the bank, get
$12,000, and she would take it and leave,'' Sgt. Mark Langford said.
   No charges were filed against the woman's brother.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze made an unprecedented visit to NATO headquarters today
and said the Warsaw Pact and NATO must remain in place despite
sharply reduced East-West tensions.
   Later, he reiterated Soviet concerns about German reunification
and warned Western nations not to pressure the German states to
come together.
   ``We do believe the Warsaw Treaty and NATO at this crucial stage
in European development ... are able to play a very important
stabilizing role to become a stabilizing factor in Europe,''
Shevardnadze told reporters after meeting NATO Secretary-General
Manfred Woerner.
   Woerner said Shevardnadze ``mentioned the very essential role of
the Americans here in Europe'' and that the Soviet envoy expressed
interest in setting up formal links between the two military
alliances.
   Woerner said he told Shevardnadze the Warsaw Pact would have to
make further changes before such a move could be considered.
   It was the first time such a high Soviet official has been to
NATO headquarters. His visit came a day after the Western alliance
issued a report saying the Soviet Union appears to be cutting
defense spending.
   Both officials said they agreed that an accord could be wrapped
up next year on reducing conventional weapons in Europe.
   They also agreed a superpower agreement could be worked out next
year on reducing long-range nuclear weapons.
   ``My impression is that the Cold War is, indeed, over,''
Shevardnadze said later during a speech to members of the European
Parliament.
   During the speech, he welcomed the fact that Western leaders
have endorsed reunification if favored by both East and West
Germany but added, ``Any appeals or advice `to exercise
self-determination' or prescriptions as to how and when to change
the ... system of government are not only inappropriate, but may
raise doubts about the authenticity of the eventual allegedly free
choice.''
   Shevardnadze said there are two good reasons to oppose
reunification:
   ``We (the Soviet Union) paid the price of 20 million lives for
the existing European stability,'' he said of World War II.
   ``Furthermore, can the German people themselves forget the
national tragedy brought onto them by Hitlerism?''
   Separately, U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's military commander in
Europe, called events in Eastern Europe an ``enormous transition
(that) is fraught with potential dangers of instability and
uncertainty.''
   ``In the face of this, a unified NATO can be very helpful, and
it appears the Soviets recognize this as well,'' Galvin said in a
statement.
   Shevardnadze's visit to NATO was viewed as carrying great
symbolic importance at a time of a rapidly changing East-West
climate.
   On Monday, NATO released a study that said the Soviet Union
appears to have begun cutting its defense expenditures, including
in the critical area of conventional forces.
   The analysis offers new evidence that the Kremlin is trying to
pare down its massive military industry.
   A year ago, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev went before
the United Nations and promised to unilaterally cut Soviet forces
by 500,000 troops and reduce conventional arms substantially.
   A month later, he called for a 14.2 percent cut in military
spending and a 19.5 percent reduction in military production.
   ``A number of major procurement programs, particularly in the
land armaments area, are being scaled back,'' the NATO report says.
It adds, however, that it is too early to tell whether all of
Gorbachev's promises will be carried out.
   To the European Parliament, Shevardnadze outlined at length his
concerns about German reunification.
   ``Where are the political, legal and material guarantees that
German unity would not eventually create a threat to the national
security of other states and to peace in Europe?'' he asked.
   ``Will such a hypothetical Germany ... be ready to accept the
existing borders in Europe and renounce any territorial claims? As
we know, the government of the Federal republic of Germany has
avoided answering that question.''
   Europe, he said, must have two ``sovereign German states ... A
retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in Europe.''
   Shevardnadze later flew to London for talks with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. He made no statement upon arriving at the
airport.

   The driver accused in a collision that
killed 27 people on a church bus gulped down a vodka drink shortly
before the crash, a witness testified.
   Kelly Osborne, testifying for the prosecution Monday, ``blew
away'' defense attorneys' argument that Larry Mahoney was tricked
into getting drunk, said Special Prosecutor Paul Richwalsky.
   Mahoney ``just picked up the cup ... and he just drank it
straight down,'' Osborne testified. ``He coughed a couple of times.
I figured it was just because he had drank it so quick.''
   Later Monday, William Boehly, a statistician for the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said there was never a
comparable disaster with a school bus and that no child had died
from a fire aboard a school bus since 1975.
   Rebuttal testimony continued today, with an auto safety
consultant for the defense disputing the prosecution's contention
that the bus was safe.
   Byron Bloch of Potomac, Md., testified that school buses were
safe only from Boehly's ``narrow statistical perspective.'' ``It
would be erroneous to conclude that his data rubber-stamp the
accident bus as a safe bus,'' said Bloch.
   Mahoney, 36, is accused of causing the nation's worst
drunken-driving accident: on May 14, 1988, when he drove his pickup
truck on the wrong side of Interstate 71 five miles south of
Carrollton, striking the bus.
   The case was expected to go to the jury on Wednesday.
   Mahoney, a factory worker, is charged with 27 counts of murder
for the 24 children and three adults; 12 counts of first-degree
assault, representing the most severely injured survivors; 42
counts of wanton endangerment for other survivors and motorists who
dodged his pickup on the wrong side of the divided highway; and one
count of drunken driving.
   The bus, a 1977 model built by Ford Motor Co. and Sheller-Globe
Corp., was owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of God church in
Hardin County, 100 miles southwest. The victims had been on a
church outing to an amusement park near Cincinnati.
   Prosecution testimony Monday began with Osborne, who said
Mahoney had asked him for the ``mixed drink'' of vodka and Sprite
that he downed at the home of Jay Gibson, Osborne's neighbor.
   Hildebrand and other defense attorneys disparaged Osborne's
testimony, pointing out that he failed to mention vodka _ he only
talked of Mahoney drinking beer _ in at least three interviews with
investigators on both sides.
   Autopsies showed the 27 died of smoke inhalation.
   Eugene Sober, a fire safety engineer for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, testified for the defense
last week that many of the victims could have survived if the bus'
seats had been fire resistant.
   But Hugh T. Spencer, a University of Louisville chemical
engineering professor and accident consultant, said the victims
were doomed from the instant that fuel from the ruptured gas tank
ignited.
   ``It was over at that point,'' he said.

   The Navy's top admiral has told commanders
they ``must do better'' to improve the service's safety record
following evaluation of the unprecedented two-day freeze on routine
operations last month, Navy sources said today.
   Adm. Carlisle A. H. Trost, chief of naval operations, faulted
commanders for exercising poor supervision during the Navy's many
dangerous operations, saying the level of effective supervision on
the scene was often inadequate when accidents occurred.
   Trost offered the critique in a letter Monday that summed up his
findings in light of the mid-November ``safety stand-down'' he had
ordered after a string of serious accidents killed 10 sailors.
   The Associated Press obtained the contents of Trost's letter
from Navy sources.
   The admiral told commanders that he found the stand-down was
executed professionally at all levels, and that there was no single
thread that tied the string of accidents together.
   But he said, ``One life lost is an unacceptable price. We simply
must do better.''
   A Navy source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trost
complained that sailors had not been properly taught to do their
jobs, that supervind boning utility 1-3, 50.00-55.00, high

<UNK>`Cold Comfort Farm' Novelist Dies</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stella Gibbons, who won fame with her first novel
``Cold Comfort Farm,'' died Tuesday at the age of 87.
   Miss Gibbons, who suffered from a heart condition, died at her
home in north London.
   She wrote more than 30 novels and volumes of short stories and
poems but none rivaled her celebrated story, which parodied an
earthy, regional school of writing popular at the turn of the
century.
   ``Cold Comfort Farm,'' published in 1932, tells how the
sophisticated Flora Poste visits her rural relatives, the weird
Starkadder family, and reclaims them from gloom, doom and feuding.
   In guidebook manner, the novelist inserted asterisks to mark
passages characteristic of the authors she parodied, such as Sheila
Kaye-Smith, Mary Webb and D.H. Lawrence.
   Miss Gibbons' 1933 poem, ``The Marriage of Machines,''
prophesied world pollution and destruction of wildlife.
   She was a journalist before she turned to books and was twice
married. Her second husband was actor and singer Allan Webb, who
died in 1959.
   He had been reclusive for the past 30 years, said her
son-in-law, John Richardson. ``She hated all publicity and politics
and really disliked modern life,'' he said.

   Security measures were ordered stepped up
Tuesday at Greece's major airports, seaports, border posts and
other high-risk targets following recent reports on possible Middle
East terrorism.
   Public Order Minister Dimitris Manikas said the alert was a
joint decision made last week by the European Community's security
officials, and in reaction to the arrest of suspected Shiite Moslem
terrorists in Spain on Nov. 23.
   In addition, the U.S. State Department sent an advisory Dec. 15
to U.S. embassies expressing its concern that terrorists may be
planning near-term attacks against U.S. interests.
   The increased vigilance was ordered at Greece's airports,
frontier posts, seaports, embassies and airline offices.
   Manikas declined to disclose whether information had been
received advising of possible terrorist action in Greece.
   He said security at Athens International Airport, a hub for
Middle Eastern points, was already one of the tightest in the world.
   Terrorists have struck in Greece several times in the past 10
years. In the most recent incident in July 1988, nine people were
killed and 53 injured in a grenade attack aboard a Greek liner as
it sailed toward Athens. No one has ever been arrested in the
bloody incident but police suspect terrorists of Middle Eastern
origin were involved.

<HEAD>China Criticizes Calls for Greater Democracy in Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   China on Tuesday criticized demands for greater
democracy in Hong Kong as an attempt to ``bring the Chinese
government to its knees'' and limit its sovereignty after Britain
returns the colony in 1997.
   It also said it was up to Britain to ``come back to the correct
road of friendly cooperation.'' China's relations with Britain, as
with most Western countries, have deteriorated following the
Chinese army attack on pro-democracy protesters in June.
   The comments came in a lengthy essay excerpted in the official
People's Daily and other newspapers, to be published in full in the
weekly Beijing Review magazine. The essay marked the fifth
anniversary of the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in
which Britain agreed to return Hong Kong and China agreed to let it
remain capitalist for at least 50 years.
   The essay said that although Hong Kong will retain a ``high
degree of autonomy'' after 1997, its relationship to Beijing will
be that of a local government to a sovereign central state.
   ``Some people, in an attempt to pit `democracy against
communism,' suggest that the `democratic process be accelerated' in
developing Hong Kong's democratic system,'' the essay said.
   ``They stress that this is the desire of the Hong Kong people in
an attempt to create a de facto situation to bring the Chinese
government to its knees. These people are actually seeking, under
the pretext of democracy, to establish a power pattern in Hong Kong
after 1997 that will ... harm China's sovereignty,'' it said.
``This, we resolutely oppose.''
   Some Hong Kong residents, fearful of Chinese rule, have pressed
the colonial government to introduce more democratic rule in the
hope that China would find it hard to undo such reforms after 1997.
The Hong Kong government has agreed to allow elections in 1991 to
fill 10 of the 56 seats in the colony's legislative council, which
is appointed by the government and local interest groups.
   There also have been calls for at least 40 percent of Hong
Kong's post-1997 legislature to be popularly elected. But the Hong
Kong-Chinese committee drafting the colony's post-1997 basic law
recently agreed that only 30 percent of the delegates should be
chosen by elections.
   China has reiterated that it will not allow Hong Kong to become
a base for anti-government and anti-Communist activity, and has
moved to include in the basic law provisions against subversive
activity.
   The essay said Hong Kong residents will be allowed after 1997 to
raise opinions about China's state affairs, but only through legal
channels.
   ``If unsuitable means are adopted to express one's own
viewpoints, things might go contrary to their wishes and damage
might be brought upon the friendly relationship between the
mainland and Hong Kong,'' it warned. All political activity will
have to respect the mainland's socialist system, it said.
   The mainland's Constitution allows no political activity
independent of the Communist Party.
   A committee of 33 mainland delegates and 23 Hong Kong delegates
is working on the final draft of Hong Kong's post-1997 basic law.
It is to be submitted to China's legislature in the spring for
approval.

<HEAD>Not Only `No Room at the Inn' _ No Inn</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Traditional English versions of the Bible say
Jesus was born in a stable because there was no room in the inn,
but a new look at the old words suggests there probably wasn't even
an inn at Bethlehem.
   Biblical scholar Jim Fleming said Joseph and Mary more likely
couldn't get the guest room at a family compound, crowded with
other relatives home for a Roman-mandated census, and sought
privacy in a nearby stable.
   The stable, he adds, probably was not a cozy wooden structure
but a shepherd's cave cut into limestone.
   And the manger, or feeding trough, was not hewn from wood but
built of stone, he says.
   Fleming said at newsconference sponsored by Israel's Tourism
Ministry that he is not challenging doctrine but interpretation.
   ``The message is to try to help Christians to understand the
simplicity of Christ's birth,'' he said.
   Fleming, director of the Biblical Resources Study Center near
Bethlehem, believes the traditional image of the first Christmas
stems from inaccurate translation of early Greek versions of the
New Testament.
   These Greek texts of the nativity in Luke use the word
``katalymati.''
   ``Inn,'' he says, ``may be traditional, but it is a bad
translation. The word normally is translated as guest chamber.''
   So what, nearly 2,000 years ago, was a guest chamber? And why
wasn't it available to Mary and Joseph?
   ``Most houses from the time of Jesus were ... many roomed
apartment compounds for multiple families,'' Fleming said. ``In
such clusters, one room was reserved for relatives or friends of
any of the families living in the compound.''
   Fleming notes that Joseph and Mary, like thousands of other
families, were required to return to their home town for a census.
   ``If the katalymati, the guest chamber, was already taken, they
would go elsewhere, seeking privacy for the birth,'' he said.
   And what better place, he said, than a stable cut into
limestone. Such stable-caves still dot the surrounding landscape.
   ``Animals were kept in caves because they maintained a constant
temperature, not too cold in winter and not too hot in summer,''
Fleming said.
   In the Holy Land, most feeding and watering mangers for animals
still are built from stone. One lined with fresh hay ``would be a
comfortable place for a newborn infant,'' Fleming said.
   The cave scenario is reflected in the Church of the Nativity in
nearby Bethlehem, he said. The site revered as Christ's birthplace
is in a cave-like grotto below the church's main altar.
   Fleming, 46, a native of Los Angeles, earned a doctor's degree
at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas,
and did post-graduate studies in historical geography and
archaeology at Jerusalem's Hebrew University, where he is a
lecturer.

   Rosa Yvonne Benton, 22, and her two daughters, 3-year-old Sara

Fields said.
   Preliminary investigations show the fire apparently was caused
by the children playing with a blanket near a hot space heater.

   Glasnost has come to the home of
``Amerika,'' a 1986 television mini-series that depicted fictitious
life in the United States after a Soviet takeover.
   Techumseh high school and elementary students recently began
receiving responses to letters they wrote in August to students in
Ryazan, 150 miles southwest of Moscow.
   Teachers are hoping the letters educate their students about the
vastness of the world and about the society and politics of the
Soviet Union, which had ``taken over'' Tecumseh during the filming
of the mini-series in this southeastern Nebraska town of 1,900.
   ``I hope they get a better understanding of the world _ that
it's a much bigger place than just Tecumseh, and that people around
the world do similar things,'' said Janene Bartels, a first-grade
teacher who helped initiate the project.
   High school English teacher Sheryl Allen said world politics
seemed too distant for most of today's students.
   ``They're more concerned with what they're doing this weekend or
what they're doing after the basketball game,'' Allen said. ``I'm
hoping this might personalize it for them so that they'll turn on
the news at night.''
   Students in Allen's senior English classes received individual
responses, while students in Bartels' first-grade class received
one letter for the entire class, complete with photos of the class
and Ryazan.
   The letters already have dispelled some stereotypes.
   Jamie Carson, a 17-year-old senior, said she perceived the
Soviet Union as ``cold, gray and very strict'' but discovered that
teen interests in music, clothes and sports were very similar.
   Soviet students mentioned Billy Joel and Michael Jackson as rock
music idols, and talked of brands of clothing available in America.
   Mark Sherman, a 17-year-old senior, said he was amazed that his
pen pal, a 16-year-old aspiring actress, was so stylishly dressed,
and that her photograph had appeared in a national magazine.
   ``I had the impression there were people walking around the
streets with guns,'' Sherman said. He and the other senior English
students said they hoped they could dispell some myths about
Americans, too.
   The letter exchange was intitiated by Col. Barney Oldfield, a
Johnson County native who is now a Beverly Hills, Calif., author,
publicist and consultant on Soviet affairs to the Litton Corp. The
wife of Oldfield's Russian interpreter, Galina Korzhikova, is an
English teacher in Ryazan.
   Bartels said she hoped the student letter exchange would pay
dividends in promoting better U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``Maybe by the time they grow up, communications with Russia
will be very open,'' she said. ``But for now, it's a start.''

   The White House today defended President
Bush's secret dealings with China, insisting he has been forthright
with the American people but saying he feels free to send
emissaries on unpublicized missions.
   The statement from White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
came amid criticism from a congressional leader that Bush ``misled
the American people'' by sending high-level officials to Beijing
barely a month after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   The secret mission in July, kept hidden from the public and
Congress until Monday, was carried out by national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.
   The two officials visited Beijing on Bush's orders even as the
United States was saying that high-level U.S. exchanges had been
cut in protest of the crushing of the pro-democracy movement.
   ``We've been forthright,'' Fitzwater said today. ``The
forthrightness is in saying we are going to have these kinds of
contacts.
   ``We have and will have (such trips) and they will be secret,
and it is not misleading to tell you about everything he's doing.
The president's up there in the Oval Office doing things all day
long that you don't know and won't know about, and that's not
misleading,'' the spokesman said.
   He refused to say whether there have been any other high-level
contacts with China that have been kept secret.
   Speaking generally about Bush's foreign policy, Fitzwater said,
``There have been trips you don't know about and there will be
more.''
   It was Scowcroft and Eagleburger who also quietly traveled to
China this month expressing hopes to ``bring new impetus and
vigor'' in Sino-American relations.
   In Beijing today, China's Foreign Ministry issued a statement
saying the government had received Scowcroft last July at the
Unites States' request.
   ``Such high-level contacts between China and the United States
are useful and conducive to enhancing the mutual understanding,''
the statement from Beijing said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said in a
statement he was ``astonished'' to learn of the July meeting,
saying the trips to Beijing ``make a mockery of our profession of
concern for human rights and the stated ideals of our democratic
system of government.''
   Mitchell called on the Bush administration to disclose all U.S.
contacts with the Chinese government.
   However, Fitzwater said Monday that he could not rule out the
possibility that Scowcroft and Eagleburger, or other top officials,
had made other, still-secret trips to China.
   The Dec. 8 visit was announced after the two officials arrived
in Beijing. The July visit was acknowledged only after it was
reported by the Cable News Network, and the White House refused to
provide any details, even the date of the trip.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of a House Foreign Affairs
subcommittee on trade, said Bush ``misled the American people and
the Congress.''
   ``How does the White House square that (earlier trip) with their
statements at the time that high-level contacts with the Chinese
were cut off?'' Gejdenson said. ``The sad reality is that the
president confuses his personal relationship with the Chinese
leaders with what is good national policy.''
   Fitzwater said Bush felt it was essential to hold quiet
diplomatic discussions with China outside ``the public glare''
regarding its crackdown.
   ``The president has had years of experience with China and he
knows that face-to-face declarations are important to them, and
felt it was important that they knew privately and from someone on
his immediate staff just how strongly the United States felt about
this,'' Fitzwater said.
   A White House statement said the July mission was undertaken to
underscore U.S. ``shock and concern about the violence in Tiananmen
Square and to impress upon the Chinese government the seriousness
with which this incident was viewed in the United States.''
   Even before the July trip to Beijing was disclosed, Bush was
defending his China policies, insisting that the United States
should not isolate a country with a population of more than a
billion people.
   Bush refused to say whether China's hardline leaders offered any
concessions in exchange for his gesture of taking the first step to
repair relations.
   ``I'm not going to discuss what I did or didn't get,'' the
president said.
   ``You see, I still believe that sometimes to affect change, you
talk in confidence to people,'' Bush said, who has been accused by
Democrats of ``kowtowing'' to China.
   ``And I notice now,'' Bush said, ``that some of the critics who
were so opposed (and) using this fantastically, diabolically
anti-me language, they come up now in saying, `Well, if you get a,
b and c, then it will be all right, or then we'll understand. Let
them just stay tuned.''
   Bush also said he does not know when Chinese dissident Fang
Lizhi will be able to leave the U.S. embassy in Beijing, where he
has taken refuge since the crackdown. Quoting Scowcroft, Fitzwater
denied there were any negotiations with China about an acceptable
country where Fang might go.

<HEAD>Corrections Officials to Investigate Work-Release Escapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials will review the prison
work release system in Bradenton after an escapee was arrested on
rape charges in the second such incident in six weeks.
   One rape suspect was on work release; the other was assigned to
the minimum-security work release center but was not authorized to
work outside the facility, Chief Rod Groom, administrator of the
center, said today.
   David Tune, head of the state's work release system, and a team
of corrections officials will review the backgrounds of all inmates
in the Bradenton center to ensure they qualify for work release,
the Bradenton Herald reported today.
   Officials said some changes in the system are likely after the
latest escape _ the fourth in six weeks.
   The inquiry follows an attack Sunday morning on a Bradenton
woman. Sheriff's deputies charged Gilbert Diamond, 30, of Tarpon
Springs with breaking into her home and attacking her at knifepoint.
   Diamond, who was convicted of burglary and aggravated assault,
had left his work-release job as a dishwasher at an all-night
restaurant early and did not return to the center.
   Work release is a kind of correctional halfway house; convicts
are allowed to finish their sentences while holding jobs outside
jail. The only time they are permitted to be away from the center
is during working hours.
   The program is open to almost all inmates with less than two
years left to serve. Only sex offenders and kidnappers are
automatically excluded.
   Kidnappers were also excluded earlier this month after a man
convicted of that offense, Craig Allan Mrozowski, 30, escaped from
the Bradenton center where he worked as a cook and trusty and was
later accused of raping an Oneco woman.
   Corrections Department spokesman Bob Macmaster said the first
thing the inspection team will look at is whether to let inmates
work late-night shifts. Skeleton staffs make it difficult for
employers to keep tabs on them, and darkness makes it hard to track
down escapees, officials said.
   The exclusion of all violent felons from the program would have
a substantial impact, but officials did not know how many of the
3,020 work release prisoners statewide would be returned to jail.
   Only four or five of the 101 inmates at the Bradenton center
work nights, said the facility's administrator, Rod Groom.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa mourned Andrei D.
Sakharov in a dark cemetery long after the crowds had left, and he
then moved on to meet with the human rights champion's successors.
   Walesa said Tuesday he met maverick Communist Boris Yeltsin,
historian Yuri Afanasyev, and others in the InterRegional Group of
progressive Soviet parliamentarians at a wake for Sakharov Monday
night. In his last speech, Sakharov had urged the group to become
an official opposition to the Communist Party.
   Walesa, whose Solidarity trade union overwhelmed Poland's
Communist Party in free elections and formed the first
non-Communist government in Eastern Europe, said Sakharov's death
``was a huge loss for the reforms, for perestroika'' in the Soviet
bloc.
   ``His mind, his thoughts were needed by the Soviet people very
much in these difficult times,'' Walesa said. In the Soviet Union,
he said, ``the crisis has not yet begun.''
   Walesa and Sakharov, who both won Nobel Peace prizes, fought for
human rights and peaceful reform at the cost of their personal
freedom.
   Walesa came to Moscow on a private visit for the funeral of
Sakharov, whom he met in Paris at the invitation of French
President Francois Mitterrand. His flight was delayed by bad
weather, so he arrived at the cemetery Monday night, well after
Sakharov was buried.
   In an interview at the Polish Embassy before departing Moscow,
Walesa said that although this was a private visit, his advisers
are working on an official visit at an unspecified date. Walesa is
expected to meet with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on that trip.
   When asked to compare the reform efforts in Poland and the
Soviet Union, Walesa looked at a Soviet reporter and said, ``You do
not know what real crisis is. You are coming to it.''
   ``The big question is how to combine economic reforms with
political reforms,'' he said. ``A strong will and strong nerves are
needed to choose the right path to overcome all the difficulties.''
   He spoke in favor of the Polish path of encouraging small
private enterprise, selling stock in businesses, and letting
workers and farmers ``feel like property owners.''

<HEAD>Newly Recognized Tribe Could Face A Battle Over Cellular Phones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after the Wampanoag Indians won a battle
to gain official recognition as a tribe, they are willing to pit
themselves against a major telephone company to get into the
cellular phone business.
   The tribe is after a Federal Communications Commission license
estimated to be worth millions of dollars that was to be awarded by
lottery Wednesday.
   The Wampanoags formed a company to operate a cellular telephone
system on Cape Cod and its surrounding islands off the
Massachusetts coast within a year after they won a promise of land
for a reservation on one of the islands, Martha's Vineyard.
Revenues from the company would help them build their community,
the say.
   All they need now is the license. But Nynex Corp. says the tribe
isn't providing telephone service, so is not eligible to compete in
the lottery against the already established company. The Wampanoags
say federal law favors Indian economic development.
   The FCC lottery pits Indian Cellular Telephone Co. against Nynex
Mobile Communications, a subsidiary of Nynex Corp., which provides
phone service throughout New York and New England.
   The issue is complicated by the fact that two licenses will be
awarded.
   One license will go to a ``wire line'' applicant, defined as a
company that provides phone service to the area; the other will go
to a ``non-wire line'' applicant, which can be a company or
individual with demonstrated financial ability to run the system.
   The FCC has hundreds of non-wire line applicants, but only three
on the other side: the Wampanoags, Nynex Mobile and Elizabeth
Islands Telephone Co., which serves a small number of phones on
Naushon Island.
   Nynex and Elizabeth Islands struck a deal before the lottery.
Peter Harrigan, general manager of Nynex Mobile, refused to
disclose the details, except to say, ``We have two of the three
chips.''
   If the third chip, belonging to the Wampanoags, is picked,
Harrigan said his company will appeal the case to the FCC.
   ``We don't believe Indian Cellular is a qualified applicant,''
he said. ``There is a rule that you have to be providing telephone
service.''
   But Tom Tureen, a lawyer for the tribe, said while Indian
Cellular does not currently provide phone service, it should
nonetheless be considered a phone company under FCC rules.
   ``Federal laws must be interpreted to take the special status of
tribes into consideration,'' he said. ``Federal Indian policy
favors Indian economic development and self determination.''
   Myron Peck, deputy chief of mobile services for the FCC, said he
could not discuss whether the agency's rules would be bent for the
Wampanoags.
   ``If they happen to win, depending on the issues that are
raised, we will look at it then,'' he said.
   Peck said the FCC has not yet been forced to decide such an
issue. A similar case occurred in Arizona, where the Gila River
Indians won a lottery, but they reached a settlement recently with
a subsidiary of U.S. West Communications before the case reached
the commission.
   Tureen said he could not predict whether the Wampanoags would
settle the case if they are contested. ``We will vigorously pursue
our application,'' he said. ``We've had tough battles before.''
   The Wampanoags gained federal recognition as a tribe in 1987
culminating a legal battle begun in 1974, when the Wampanoags filed
a lawsuit to recover aboriginal lands.
   About 280 Wampanoag Indians live on Martha's Vineyard, and the
tribe is renting office space in the town of Gay Head. About 250
acres of land have been put into federal trust. Once the land
acquisition is finished, the tribe will have a reservation where
the Indians can build homes.
   Forrest Cuch, a tribal planner, said if the Wampanoags get the
license, the revenue could help with housing, offices and community
buildings.
   ``That would really get us off the ground,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela wants to be leave
prison immediately but won't beg for his freedom, said one of five
militant union officials who had a long meeting with the black
nationalist leader Tuesday.
   Mandela, whose release is widely expected in the next six weeks,
has been allowed a series of meetings at his prison quarters with
anti-apartheid leaders.
   Tuesday's six-hour encounter was his first with a delegation
from the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's
largest labor federation and a powerful force within the
anti-apartheid movement.
   Syndey Mufamadi, the federation's assistant secretary-general,
said Mandela wants to be freed now, but in the meantime had decided
to continue periodic talks with government officials.
   ``He is not a go-between, but is in a position to meet
government officials and to convey their views to our movement,''
Mufamadi said. ``Mr. Mandela sees himself as a prisoner and not in
any position to enter negotiations at this stage.''
   President F.W. de Klerk met with Mandela last week at the
presidential office in Cape Town.
   The meeting prompted press speculation that some members and
supporters of Mandela' African National Congress guerrilla movement
were worried that he was opening talks with the government before
it met the ANC's preconditions. These include release of all
political prisoners, lifting of the state of emergency and lifting
a ban on the ANC.
   ``Mandela does not see any possibility of negotiations unless
the proper climate is created,'' Mufamadi said. ``His release is
just one of these issues. ... He is not prepared to beg for his
release.''
   Mufamadi said Mandela sees himself as a ``disciplined member of
the ANC'' who would not act in conflict with the organization's
exiled leadership in Zambia.
   Mufamadi said the main purpose of Tuesday's meeting was to brief
Mandela, 71, on developments in the anti-apartheid movement.
   ``Comrade Mandela's message to the people is that the struggle
must continue,'' Mufamadi said.
   The five-man delegation included prominent activists who head
two of the labor federation's biggest affiliates: Cyril Ramaphosa
of the National Union of Mineworkers and Moses Mayekiso of the
National Union of Metalworkers.
   Mandela, the most popular leader among South Africa's black
majority, has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence
for plotting anti-government sabotage. Virtually all prominent
black leaders have said they won't enter negotiations until he is
freed.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha met Tuesday with Britain's
ambassador, Robin Renwick, to discuss media reports that British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had made a formal appeal for
Mandela to be released before Christmas.
   Mrs. Thatcher's office denied this, saying she had not set any
new time frame for her standing request that Mandela be freed ``as
soon as possible.''
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new Constitution that would
extend political rights to blacks. He opposes a one-person,
one-vote system and wants whites to retain veto power over major
policy decisions.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Condemns Use of Police Force in Romania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today condemned the
``brutal use of police force'' in Romania and said the United
States was consulting with allies about the possibility of sending
independent observers to see what was happening.
   ``The repressive measures undertaken by the Romanian government
are totally unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive
changes taking place elsewhere in Eastern Europe,'' said White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The United States condemns the brutal use of police force by
the Romanian government,'' Fitzwater said.
   Romania has virtually sealed off its borders, but witnesses say
security forces have shot and killed dozens of people in
anti-government rioting that began over the weekend.
   Unconfirmed reports have put the death toll at up to 400 and one
witness was quoted as saying he saw helicopters fire on crowds in
the city of Timisoara.
   ``The demonstrations in Timisoara and elsewhere were a result of
the systematic denial of human rights to the people of Romania,
particularly to members of the Hungarian minority,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said the United States was calling on the government ``to
cease this brutal repression, open its borders and respect the
human rights commitments of the Helsinki Final Act.''
   Moreover, he said the United States was urging Romania to allow
international observers to visit Timisoara and other cities where
violence has been reported. On that point, Fitzwater said the
United States was consulting with allies in hopes of getting an
independent verfication of what was transpiring.
   Fitzwater said there is a provision under the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe that allows member
countries to verify independently events in other participating
states. Both Romania and the United States are members of the
conference.

   Premier Marian Calfa said Tuesday
all domestic operations of the dreaded secret police have been
halted.
   ``It is one of our priorities to adjust the work of the Interior
Ministry to the new social conditions and turn this ministry into a
component of state administration based on democratic principles,''
Calfa told Parliament, outlining his domestic and foreign policies.
   ``I can tell you that as of today the operations of the police
force in the field of internal intelligence have been stopped,''
Calfa said.
   In 41 years of Communist rule, secret police agents were
involved in continuous surveillance operations against citizens and
were responsible for the interrogation and harassment of dissidents
and independent thinkers.
   Opposition leader Vaclav Havel, once a dissident playwright and
now the leading contender for president, has spoken about the
constant threat of a house search; that every visitor to his home
was photographed; and every conversation bugged by the Communist
regime.
   Havel's house in downtown Prague was continuously monitored from
a nearby tower, and cameras were installed by the secret police in
other streets where dissidents lived.
   Police have been the target of public anger since they broke up
a peaceful student rally Nov. 17, igniting the pro-democracy
revolution that ended Communist domination.
   ``The police action in the streets of Prague has shaken the
faith of citizens in the police force ... the government is taking
steps to prevent the abuse of security forces against the people of
this country,'' Calfa said.
   A parliamentary commission is investigating the crackdown.
   The new government, the country's first non-Communist-dominated
Cabinet in 41 years, does not include an interior minister,
responsible for all branches of the police including the secret
force. Instead, those functions have been assumed by a three-man
committee consisting of Calfa and two deputy premiers.
   Despite the move to control the secret police, opposition
members and students, fearing a coverup of past misdeeds, have been
patrolling police offices and police archives to prevent the
destruction of incriminating documents.
   Activists in Brno reported last week that police documents were
being burned, including documents from the 1950s and others bearing
the names of well-known dissidents.

   Snow whitened the Midwest today, sleet put the Deep South on the
skids and ice clogged the Mississippi and Missouri rivers as much
of the nation remained in the grip of an cold wave blamed for 40
deaths.
   ``Icky, icky, icky,'' was how Duplin County, N.C., sheriff's
dispatcher Jennie Myrick described it this morning. ``We have
sleet, lovely sleet. We have accumulation of about an inch on most
of the roads.''
   A wintry storm bedeviled the Deep South on Monday with sleet and
freezing rain, and another onslaught of cold air from Canada
advanced through the Plains today. In Illinois this morning, Peoria
and Springfield received about 4 inches of snow, with an inch
reported in the Chicago area.
   In Colorado, motorists slipping and sliding along icy,
snow-packed roads deluged the Rocky Mountain AAA Auto Club with 100
to 150 calls an hour for tow trucks.
   Ski resort operators, meanwhile, were a very happy lot.
   ``We're set up for the rest of the season,'' said Barb Jennings,
spokeswoman at a Steamboat Springs ski lodge, where storms have
dumped 110 inches of powder in the last nine days. ``We're ready to
do some powder skiing.''
   On Monday, the storm iced roads from Mississippi to the
Carolinas. There were scores of minor accidents, and traffic came
to a standstill in many areas. ``If you had a cardiac now it could
be a matter of living or dying because of the roads,'' said police
dispatcher Ronnie Toliver in Little Rock, Ark.
   The cold has been blamed for nine traffic deaths and 31 other
fatalities since Friday, among them Atlanta Falcons player Brad
Beckman, who was killed Monday in a crash on icy Interstate 85
outside Atlanta.
   The fatalities also included a homeless man who set himself on
fire in a New York City subway station while using a hotplate to
keep warm, and an 86-year-old found dead, apparently of exposure,
in the driveway of her Birmingham, Mich., home.
   In Chicago, a man got stuck in the ventilator shaft at a
restaurant, apparently during a burglary attempt, and died of
exposure, police said.
   In Apalachin, N.Y., a woman accused of pouring water on her
7-year-old foster daughter and leaving her outside as the
temperature dipped to 5 degrees was charged Monday with murder.
Police said Lisa Braden, 36, put the girl outside as punishment.
   Dickinson, N.D., reported a record 23-below zero this morning.
Bismarck reached minus 34, two degrees above the record. Denver's
Stapleton International Airport reported a record 10 below-zero
reading, one degree below the previous record set in 1924.
   In Youngstown, Ohio, the temperature dipped to minus 3 this
morning, breaking a record of 2 below set in 1963. Monday's reading
of 12 below also set a record.
   Record-breaking cold gripped at least 11 cities Monday,
including Pittsburgh, minus 7, and Lexington, Ky., 1 below. The
outlook for most of the country is for below-average temperatures
for the next month or so, according to the National Weather Service.
   With even the desert Southwest expecting relatively chilly
60-degree temperatures, South Florida is the only hot spot. Miami's
forecast called for highs in the 80s today.
   Though winter doesn't officially begin until Thursday, ice
forced closure of a 200-mile stretch of the Mississippi River to
barge traffic from Cairo, Ill., to St. Louis. The ice compounded
navigation problems posed by low water that has plagued barge
operators because of the summer's drought, the Coast Guard said in
announcing the closure Monday night.
   This is the slowest time of year for shipping on the Mississippi.
   The Missouri River turned to ice for the 75 miles between Blair,
Neb., just north of Omaha, and Sioux City, Iowa, the weather
service reported.
   The ice jam began late Friday and has continued to grow.
Officials feared that the freeze could cause problems for
communities that pump their water from the river, and Weather
Service hydrologist Roy Osugi didn't hold out hope for an early
thaw.
   ``Nothing is going to bust it up except warmer weather,'' Osugi
said. ``We think it's going to stay in place at least this week
because it's going to stay very cold.''
   In St. Joseph, Mo., officials activated a new emergency pump as
a precaution to keep water flowing to the city.
   Some merchants welcomed the chill, saying it drove people to
warm indoor malls and shops.
   ``Were selling lots of mufflers, outerwear, coats and gloves,''
said Robert Spevak, senior vice president at the Alexander's
department store in New York.

   Albania on Tuesday condemned as a
``fabrication'' a report in a Yugoslav newspaper about an alleged
demonstation in the Albanian city of Shkodra.
   The Belgrade daily Politika Ekspres on Tuesday quoted sources in
the southern province of Kosovo bordering Albania, as saying there
had been a demonstration in Shkodra, a town 50 miles north of the
capital Tirana near the Yugoslav border.
   The report said the protests took place in the last few days,
but added there was no reliable report on the reasons for the
alleged demonstrations.
   The Albanian state news agency ATA on Tuesday refuted the report
as ``invented, tendentious and ill-willing.''
   It said ``no kind of demonstration has been staged in the city
of Shkodra.''
   The Albanian ambassador to Vienna, Engyell Kolaneci, also
condemned the report as a ``fabrication'' which he said was
``untrue.''
   Relations between non-aligned Communist Yugoslavia and hard-line
Communist Albania have long been strained over the ethnic Albanian
population of Kosovo province. Albania alleges they are
discriminated against, but leaders in the republic of Serbia, of
which Kosovo is an adminstrative part, charge Albania with
interference in its internal affairs.

the United States, Canada, Australia and Britain, the Simon
Wiesenthal Center said Tuesday.
   The names are listed in files of testimony from Jewish survivors
in Soviet Lithuania given three months ago to the Yad Vashem
archives in Jerusalem, which is in charge of documenting the
slayings of 6 million Jews during World War II by Nazi Germany.
   The records were kept secret for more than four decades by an
elderly Lithuanian survivor, Leibl Kuniuchovsky, who now lives in
Sunrise, Fla., said Efraim Zuroff, director of the Israeli office
of the Los Angeles-based center known for tracking down Nazi
suspects.
   ``This material has enormous significance. Based on our past
experience this can lead us to numerous Nazi war criminals now
living in the United States, Canada, Australia and the United
Kingdom,'' Zuroff said.
   He said the approximately 1,300 names on the list are
Lithuanians who collaborated with the Nazis during 1941-42, when
most mass slayings of Jews took place in the Baltic republic. More
than 200,000 Jews are believed to have been murdered by the Nazis
in Lithuania.
   Lithuania was a center of Jewish culture in Eastern Europe in
the 18th and 19th centuries and a nesting ground for the Zionist
ideology that led to the creation of Israel. The Jewish community
there numbered 1.5 million at the turn of the century and only
26,000 after World War II.
   Kuniuchovsky, a survivor of the Jewish ghetto in the city of
Kovno, took the testimony from refugees after the war on behalf of
historical commissions set up by the Allies in displaced persons
camps in West Germany, Zuroff said.
   His records are valuable because they provide rare accounts from
the few Jews who survived the mass slayings that took place in
isolated towns and villages, Zuroff said in an interview.
   He said the 1,300 names were gathered from 1,683 pages of
testimony that Kuniuchovsky took from survivors in 171 towns and
villages.
   Hundreds of the suspects were known to be alive, Zuroff added.
He declined to give names of the suspects, suggesting this could
harm efforts to seek them out for prosecution.
   ``The majority were previously unknown to us,'' he said, noting
the earlier testimony was sketchy about slayings in many isolated
areas because survivors were few and investigators were unable to
find them in later years.
   Zuroff said the Wiesenthal Center is tracking the suspects
through its four branches in the United States, one in Toronto, and
other agencies. The center is named for founder Simon Wiesenthal,
80, an Austrian-born concentration camp survivor who has devoted
much of his life to hunting down Nazi war criminals and documenting
the Holocaust.
   In addition to new suspects' names, Kuniuchovsky's file also
contains surprising information about the numbers of Lithuanians
involved in the killings, Zuroff said.
   ``It is shocking to see such a big role was played by the
intelligentsia,'' Zuroff added. ``We're talking about school
teachers, educated people'' who belonged to vigilante groups or
helped local police carry out killings.
   Zuroff also said he hoped legislation adopted in the past two
years in Canada and Australia, allowing prosecution of crimes
committed overseas, would make it easier to hunt and prosecute the
Lithuanian suspects.

   A former Justice Department investigator said
today Victor Stello Jr., nominated by President Bush to head the
nation's nuclear arms production, lied to him during a probe of the
Three Mile Island nuclear accident.
   Julian Greenspun also told the Senate Armed Services Committee
that Stello had been ``a total bully'' when he worked at the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   Greenspun said Stello, as the chief of staff at the NRC, ``lied
to me'' during Greenspun's investigation of the 1979 Three Mile
Island nuclear reactor accident in Pennsylvania.
   The former investigator said Stello had told him the power
plant's owner was not required to keep records of tests conducted
on cooling pipes. Greenspun said he later learned the records were,
in fact, required and were central to the Justice Department
investigation.
   Stello was scheduled to appear later in the day to respond to
the allegations by Greenspun and other witnesses called by the
committee.
   ``A number of things occurred that gave me great pause as a
prosecutor and as civil servant ... in terms of his candor and his
being a total bully at the NRC for people who had differences of
opinion,'' Greenspun told the committee.
   One of Stello's supporters on the committee, Sen. John Warner,
R-Va., asked Greenspun if he knew of any instances in which Stello
had broken the law.
   Greenspun responded, ``That's sort of like a politician saying,
`I ought to be elected because I haven't been indicted yet.'''
Greenspun did not charge that Stello had broken any laws in his
dealings with the investigator.
   Stello was apperaing before the panel for the second time in
little more than a month in his effort to become assistant energy
secretary for defense programs, the chief manager of the nation's
nuclear weapons program.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A committee vote on the nomination is not expected before
Congress reconvenes Jan. 23.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins made a highly unusual personal
plea to the committee last month to confirm Stello, saying the
department urgently needed him in the post in order to carry out
major safety improvements at the arms plants. Many of the
facilities are closed down for safety and technical reasons.
   The committee on Nov. 17 deferred a decision on Stello, saying
it wanted to hear from additional witnesses, including officials
who worked with him during his 26 years at the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which governs civilian uses of nuclear power.
   Former NRC chairmen John Ahearne and Joseph Hendrie were to be
among those testifying today. Ahearne has said he believes Stello
is fully qualified for the weapons job.
   In a related development, Watkins told the House and Senate
armed services committees in letters sent last Friday that he
decided, at Stello's recommendation, to put off a decision on when
to restart the Savannah River nuclear production reactors until a
study of environmental impacts is completed.
   It was not clear whether the decision could mean a delay in
resuming Savannah River production of tritium, a man-made gas
needed to make nuclear warheads. Copies of Watkins' letter were
made public Monday by a member of the House panel.
   Stello was nominated for the Energy Department job in July. He
then began working as an adviser to Watkins on the Savannah River
restart project pending a Senate decision on his nomination. Last
month Watkins decided to give Stello a second-level appointment in
the weapons office, which does not require Senate confirmation.
   Three Democratic members of the committee _ Sens. John Glenn of
Ohio, Timothy Wirth of Colorado and Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts
_ have led the fight against Stello. They contend he is ill-suited
to improve safety conditions at the plants.
   Most members of the committee have not publicly said whether
they will vote for Stello.
   While serving as the chief staff official at the NRC, Stello was
accused of altering agency regulations at the request of utilities
that operate nuclear rectors, and authorizing cash payments to an
informant as part of a vendetta within the NRC.
   At his first confirmation hearing in November, Stello strongly
defended his professional record and said he was being unfairly
attacked by anti-nuclear forces and political opponents of
controversial decisions he made at the NRC.
   In a development that could stiffen resistance to Stello's
nomination, an outside investigator concluded in a report made
public Dec. 9 that the cash payments to an informant were made
because of personal conflicts within the NRC. That contradicts
Stello's assertion that the payments were made in order to obtain
information about wrongdoing that could affect safety at a nuclear
power plant.

<HEAD>Bush to Propose Record Spending, Weighs User Fees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush worked Tuesday toward a final
version of a 1991 budget plan that sources said would include a
record $1.24 trillion in spending. Meanwhile, he signed a
deficit-fighting bill trimming the budget for this year.
   Despite Bush's ``no new taxes'' vows, the new federal budget
also is likely to propose a series of new excise taxes, including a
fee on the sale of certain recreational equipment and vehicles,
said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed that the Office
of Management and Budget was weighing such a levy, among other
``user fees.'' However, Fitzwater added, ``The budget is not final
and the decisions have not been made in the final sense.''
   Administration sources said the White House had tentatively
decided to propose new excise taxes on such recreational gear and
vehicles as camping equipment and off-road vehicles, to pay for
conservation measures.
   Other sources said Bush has tentatively decided against a new
excise tax on the sale of boats and recreational vehicles, even
though an earlier budget-office draft contained such fees.
   Bush plans to resolve all outstanding issues on the new budget
before he leaves town Friday for a ten-day Christmas vacation. The
1991 budget, for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1, goes to
Congress on Jan. 22.
   Bush's signature on the $14.7 billion budget reconciliation bill
closes the book on the 1990 budget _ with total spending put at
just under $1.2 trillion _ and lifts an order that had imposed
$16.2 billion in mandatory cuts last October.
   ``The across-the-board cuts imposed would have disrupted some
important federal activities had they remained in effect all
year,'' Bush said in signing the measure.
   Bush praised Congress for making the new cuts ``in a manner
consistent with my pledge not to raise new taxes.''
   In Congress, debate on the deficit-reduction package broke down
into partisan wrangling as the White House sought unsuccessfully to
use the measure as a vehicle for its bid for a lower capital gains
tax.
   To accomplish the needed savings, the bill retains $4.6 billion
of the across-the-board cuts and enacts $6 billion in new taxes and
fees, mostly on corporations.
   It makes up the rest by trimming Medicare payments to doctors
and hospitals, cutting some farm programs, stretching out payments
in some federal retirement programs, and speeding up collections on
payroll and gasoline taxes.
   As for the fiscal 1991 budget, while officials will not discuss
it publicly, an outline is slowly taking shape that sources say
will include:
   _Military spending of $292 billion, just $1 billion over the
current level. Reduced world tensions are responsible for some of
the defense slowdown, expected to be the smallest percentage
increase in a decade.
   _No major new initiatives, but modest increases in some
programs, including the environment, education, AIDS research, and
anti-crime and drug efforts, generally reflecting many of Bush's
first-year initiatives.
   _The abolition of some minor programs, but nothing like the
proposed wholesale agency terminations unsuccessfully proposed by
former President Reagan; cuts in Medicare funds and the proposed
sale of some federal assets.
   _A renewal of Bush's campaign for a lower capital gains tax, a
cut the administration sees as a big revenue-raiser.
   _A revival, in slightly different form, of Bush's 1988 campaign
proposal under which Americans could save up to $5,000 a year in
special tax-free ``family savings accounts'' for funds deposited 10
or more years.
   _An overhaul and consolidation of the government's credit
programs, seeking to save tax dollars by streamlining bookkeeping
on a wide range of government loans.
   The administration must come up with some $40 billion in deficit
savings in a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases to get the
budget deficit down _ on paper at least _ to the $64 billion
deficit target in the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law for fiscal
1991.
   The target for fiscal 1989 was $100 billion.
   The budget-writing chore is being made easier this year by
Bush's decision to keep the increase in defense spending down, and
by a still healthy economy, now in its eighth year of recovery with
inflation holding steady at a moderate 4 percent to 5 percent.

   The elves looked like sailors, Santa's
sleigh looked like a string of trucks and Mrs. Claus resembled
Dorcas Drake, a woman putting together her 32nd annual Christmas
party for needy children.
   ``Hurry up and take you time,'' Mrs. Drake told Navy volunteers
Monday as they left for lunch after a morning of loading the first
of 100,000 toys into seven semi-trailer trucks.
   The toys will be given out Wednesday at Mrs. Drake's all-day
fest at the Jacksonville Coliseum. Each child attending the party
will receive a bagful of toys from a small army of volunteers.
   As usual, Mrs. Drake, a former justice of the peace, fretted
earlier that she wouldn't collect enough toys for the children. As
usual, her worrying has come to another happy end.
   ``We got enough. I'll just say a quiet `Thank the Lord,''' she
said.
   The warehouse at 1 Santa Claus Lane was a whirlwind of activity
as volunteers sorted the toys. Most of the toys were donated by
their original owners and those that can't be fixed are discarded.
   Last year, an estimated 50,000 children attended the party.

   Christmas dinner with all the
trimmings is no small feat under any circumstances, but John
Fegaras is expecting at least 1,800 guests.
   The open house at one of his restaurants is becoming a Christmas
tradition, now six years old, for Fegaras who owns four restaurants
in this lakefront community.
   Three hundred people attended the first dinner, but this year
Fegaras expects more than 1,800 people, many of whom have nowhere
else to go for Christmas.
   As in past years, volunteers ranging from Mayor Robert Behler to
city bus drivers will help cook and serve the food and transport
residents to the restaurant.
   Behler and his family spent a good part of their Christmas Day
helping at the restaurant last year, and he recalls a lot of happy
and surprised people.
   ``I had a hard time convincing a family that drove in from
Interstate 94 that there was no charge for dinner,'' Behler said.
   This year's menu again will feature turkey and ham with all the
trimmings. Limited delivery service will be offered to those living
within the city who are unable to leave their homes.

   Those into the car culture have been busy
this Christmas season decking the grills with boughs of jolly.
   Car wreaths are the seasonal rage, dangling from hood ornaments
or tied to the grills of vehicles of every shape and size, from
Rolls-Royce, Mercedes-Benz and Range Rover to Chevrolet, Ford and
big-rig Peterbilt.
   ``I figure I spend so much time in my car I should decorate it
for Christmas. I think it's great because everybody is so intense
right now with he hassle of Christmas,'' said Timi Krissman
Freshman.
   She paid $18.50 for her car's plastic, snow-covered pine ring,
complete with fake miniature apples and a red velvet bow.
   ``The wreath just gives everybody a little lift,'' the
48-year-old real estate agent said.
   ``It's like (being in) your own personal sleigh,'' Jeep driver
Healy Cosay said of the wreath transformation.
   Jim Morris, who stuck a wreath on his Mercedes, said fellow
motorists look and grin, adding: ``People think I'm Santa. They
smile and honk and wave.''
   Geary's of Beverly Hills has sold more than 2,000 car wreaths
this season, said wreath designer Bruce Meyer.
   ``They're just a very friendly gesture for the season,'' he
said. ``I guess you could say we're driving motorists crazy with
Christmas cheer.''

<HEAD>Prince Deplores `Calamitous Decline' of English Usage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prince Charles on Tuesday lamented the
``calamitous decline'' in literacy in Britain and the degeneration
of the English language into a ``dismal wasteland of banality,
cliche and casual obscenity.''
   In June, the heir to the British throne had complained English
was taught ``so bloody badly'' that he had to correct all the
letters written by his staff before they were sent out.
   His criticism Tuesday was more elegantly phrased but equally
biting in singling out the teaching profession for discarding the
idea that English is a precious legacy to be handled with care.
   ``We have seen the abandonment of learning the rules of grammar
and the parts of speech as boring and irrelevant,'' he said.
   Past attacks by the 41-year-old prince on the state of language,
modern buildings, inner cities and urban sprawl, have made him
respected and feared.
   In the packed London church of St. James Garlickhythe, he
presented prizes to children for their memorized recitations from
the Book of Common Prayer, attributed to Archbishop of Canterbury
Thomas Cranmer, to mark the 500th anniversary of his birth.
   He then deplored the ending in schools of learning poetry by
heart and the idea of English as something really to be learned, by
effort and application.
   The prince also denounced what he called ``banal'' modern
versions of Cranmer's Prayer Book and the 17th century King James
Bible. The originals were commanding and poetic, he said.
   ``Poetry was for everybody. But banality is for nobody. It might
be accessible for all but so is a desert,'' he said.
   ``Is it entirely an accident that the defacing of Cranmer's
Prayer Book has coincided with a calamitous decline in literacy and
the quality of English?'' he asked.
   He said Britain had produced the world's most successful
language, which had been the medium for some of the greatest
literature, ``yet a great many people today look in dismay at what
is happening to that language in the very place where it evolved.''
   ``Looking at the way English is used in our popular newspapers,
our radio and television programs, even in our schools and our
theaters, they wonder what it is about our country and our society
that our language has become so impoverished, so sloppy and so
limited _ that we have arrived at such a dismal wasteland of
banality, cliche and casual obscenity,'' the prince said.
   He said his stand for England's heritage had led to accusations
of nostalgia for an irrelevant past.
   ``The fear of being considered old-fashioned seems to be so
all-powerful that the more eternal values and principles which run
like a thread through the whole tapestry of human existence are
abandoned under the false assumption that they restrict progress,''
he said.
   The prince had his audience laughing when he declared:
   ``Well, I'm not afraid of being considered old-fashioned, which
is why I am standing here wearing a double-breasted suit and
turn-ups _ pant-cuffs _ to my trousers, ready to declaim the fact
that I believe the Prayer Book is a glorious part of every English
speaker's heritage and, as such, ought to be a grade one listed
edifice'' _ the English phrase for a state-protected building.
   After the speech, Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National
Union of Teachers, said teachers of English had not given up
standards but they had an exhausting task in state schools.
   The Rt. Rev. John Taylor, Church of England bishop of St.
Albans, said Cranmer's language was magnificent and beautiful but
the church's new liturgy enabled modern congregations to use a
language reflecting their hopes and prayers.
   A government-appointed committee reported last year that
although English is the first language of 320 million people around
the world and spoken daily by about 1 billion people, the teaching
of English had been neglected in its country of origin. The
committee recommended that every school employ a teacher whose sole
job is to ensure the language is used properly.

<TEXT>
   The ruling party and main opposition
merged Tuesday with their first national congress, charged with
framing a new constitution.
   Since independence a decade ago, President Robert Mugabe's
dominant Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) has been
avowedly Marxist-Leninist. Former Zimbabwe African People's Union
opposition leader Joshua Nkomo was more centrist.
   About 4,200 delegates from the two parties gathered for the
four-day congress that will decide which ideological path to tread
in the light of changes in Eastern Europe, long Mugabe's role model.
   Conferees also will be asked to rule whether the new alliance
should continue to pursue Mugabe's dream of creating a one-party
state in one of Africa's few Western-style democracies.
   The congress effectively formalizes a decision by Zimbabwe's two
main political figures two years ago to unite their parties, ending
decades of interparty feuding.
   The alliance also seeks to bury 200 years of tribal hostilities
between the majority Shona tribe, which largely backs Mugabe, and
the Ndebele people who traditionally support Nkomo.
   The birth of the reconstituted ZANU arms Mugabe with the support
of all but two lawmakers in the 100-seat National Assembly and the
40-member rubber-stamp senate.
   The ruling party can pass laws and rewrite sections of the
British-drafted constitution, a document signed by all parties at
London's Lancaster House 10 years ago Thursday.
   Those constitutional talks ended nine decades of white minority
rule, halted a seven-year war waged by guerrillas loyal to Nkomo
and Mugabe and transformed the British colony of Rhodesia into
black-governed Zimbabwe at independence April 18, 1980.
   The constitution guaranteed Zimbabwe would be a multiparty
democracy for the first 10 years of independence.
   After the 10th anniversary, Mugabe can, constitutionally, ban
opposition and establish a single-party state with two-thirds of
the votes in Parliament.
   But in recent months, as pro-democratic movements have swept
Eastern Europe, Mugabe has come under mounting pressure to renounce
what he calls his Marxist-Leninist policies and to abandon the aim
of killing the multiparty system.
   Opening the congress, Mugabe indicated his stand was flexible.
   ``While we must be clear as to the ideological direction we take
... namely Marxist-Leninist socialist principles, we must also take
full cognisance of the environment and the concrete realities in
which we seek to achieve social transformation,'' he said.
   The congress, which ends Friday, is being attended also by
Presidents Quett Masire of Botswana and Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia as
well as observers from 20 countries including Cuba, North Korea and
Nicaragua.

   In a reluctant break with President Bush,
Winston Lord, America's ambassador to China until last April,
denounced the administration's secret diplomatic missions to
Beijing Tuesday as steps that will undercut China's moderates.
   He said the United States was signaling the world ``that the
blood around Tiananmen Square has truly been scrubbed away.''
   The United States would not have reversed course so swiftly if
the killings of pro-democracy demonstrators had occurred in Eastern
Europe, Lord said, contending that the ``pilgrimage'' to China this
month by presidential aide Brent Scowcroft displayed ``cultural, if
not racial bias.''
   In a telephone interview from New York, where he is now a writer
and lecturer, Lord said he had supported Bush's post-Tiananmen
Square policy of seeking to preserve a valued relationship with
China, ``but the Scowcroft trip pushed me over the edge.''
   He made his public break with Bush's policy in a signed article
in The Washington Post _ written, he said, before Monday's
revelation that Scowcroft had also led a mission to Beijing last
July, barely a month after the violent crackdown.
   ``I served briefly in China under President Bush and I have
great respect for him and his knowledge of China,'' Lord said. ``I
would have preferred not to have disagreed, but I felt this trip
was such a mistake that I had no choice.
   ``I felt I could speak with some credibility as one who had
worked on the China issue for 20 years, who had met Chairman Mao
(Tse-tung) five times, spent hundreds of hours with Chou En-lai,
has known Deng Xiaping for 15 years and made 11 trips to China
before becoming ambassador,'' Lord said. He served as U.S. envoy to
Beijing for 3{ years.
   ``One does not shore up the long-term foundations for
Sino-American relations by appearing weak to China's leaders and
callous to the Chinese and American people,'' he wrote.
   ``One does not earn respect abroad by reversing field within
months and practicing double standards,'' he added. ``One cannot
maintain a balanced approach at home by submerging our values and
disdaining congressional and public opinion.''
   If Scowcroft expressed outrage during that first visit, as the
White House says, ``then the Chinese ignored it,'' Lord said.
   On Monday, Bush said any suggestion that his actions amounted to
condoning the repression in China was ``not a good rap, and it's
not true.'' The Scowcroft missions have been condemned by Democrats
as ``kowtowing'' to China's hard-liners; few Republicans have
defended it.
   Lord argued that the approach undermined China's ``closet
moderates.''
   ``Far from strengthening their hand, the administration has
robbed them of the argument that Chinese repression and xenophobia
entail costs,'' he wrote. ``Japan, Europe and others will feel free
to follow the Scowcroft trail.''
   Lord said that while censure from Bush might not influence
China's leaders, acquiescence ``surely reinforces their view that
crushing their populace elicits only fleeting outcries, no lasting
repercussions.''
   Lord was especially critical of the toast offered by Scowcroft
during the Dec. 8 visit. He said whatever business Washington most
conduct with Beijing should be done ``in workmanlike fashion, not
with fawning emissaries.''
   In the toast, he said, Scowcroft ``lined up the administration
with the Beijing regime against the Chinese and American people''
when he said, ``In both our societies there are voices of those who
seek to redirect or frustrate our cooperation. We both must take
bold measures to overcome these negative forces.''
   Lord contrasted those words with what Secretary of State James
Baker said two days later in Berlin: ``True stability requires
governments with legitimacy, governments that are based on the
consent of the governed.''
   By condoning the violent suppression of popular, nonviolent
demonstrations, Lord said, ``the Scowcroft mission sends precisely
the wrong signals'' to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``To be sure, the administration would react strongly over a
sustained period to any massacre of innocents in Europe _ and
Gorbachev probably knows this,'' Lord wrote. ``That is precisely
the point. What we have here is not just a double standard but
cultural, if not racial, bias _ however unintentional and
unconscious.''
   ``Are we to believe that Chinese are not like Europeans, that
they never had freedom and cannot afford it now because China would
be ungovernable and `stability' is crucial to economic reform?''

New York City was due in Washington on Friday but got there Monday.
Seventy other Stuyvesant entries sent in a separate batch at the
same time arrived before the deadline.
   Carol Luszcz, program director for the prestigious Westinghouse
Science Talent Search, initially said the deadline had been clear
and ``we don't make exceptions.''
   But Federal Express admitted it misrouted the box of entries and
sent Westinghouse an affidavit to that effect, said Armand
Schneider, a spokesman for the overnight delivery service.
   News that their entries were disqualified had dashed the
students' dreams of college scholarships.
   ``I cried,'' said Ming Ling Peng, 17. ``It's the ticket to
college for most of us.''
   Stuyvesant is nationally known for academic excellence. Each
year, its students reach the semifinals or better of the talent
search, which began in 1942.
   ``We take extra courses at Columbia and N.Y.U.,'' Miss Peng said
of New York University. ``I know someone who did a physics paper he
had been working on since eighth grade.''
   Eileen Finkelstein, whose son Steven's project was late, said he
was ``devastated'' at being disqualified.
   ``Why should their blood, sweat and tears go down the drain?''
Mrs. Finkelstein asked. ``These kids are the creme de la creme of
the New York system. These are 90 kids who had no control over what
was done to them. Certainly rules can be changed a little bit.
We're talking about children's destinies.''

<HEAD>Inflation Up 0.4 Percent, Led by Food and Heating Fuel</HEAD>

   Stubborn price increases for services kept
consumer inflation at 0.4 percent last month despite a drop in
gasoline costs, the government said Tuesday in a report economists
said could discourage the Federal Reserve Board from cutting
interest rates.
   The gain in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index,
bolstered by a 0.6 percent advance in the service sector, showed
that inflation is persisting despite sluggishness in housing and
manufacturing, analysts said.
   November's seasonally adjusted increase, which translated into
an annual inflation rate of 4.9 percent, followed a brisk 0.5
percent rise in October and relatively modest hikes from June
through September.
   Through the first 11 months of this year, consumer prices have
risen at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from the
4.4 percent price gains in both 1988 and 1987.
   ``There's no evidence that inflation is accelerating, but
there's a lot of evidence that says inflation is pretty stubborn at
current levels,'' said economist Robert Brusca of Nikko
International Securities Co. Inc.
   Last month's price spurt, slightly higher than many analysts had
been expecting, contributed to more skittishness on Wall Street,
where the Dow Jones industrial stock average fell in early trading
before recovering later in the day.
   Before Tuesday's report, many traders had been hoping that
Federal Reserve policymakers, finishing a two-day, closed-door
meeting Tuesday, would push interest rates down another notch
before Christmas. The Fed had brought rates down 0.25 percentage
point in early November.
   That hope had been strengthened Friday, when the Labor
Department said wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in November, the
third decline in five months. But the prospects of further Fed
action were dampened by the consumer price report.
   ``The Fed could still move,'' Brusca said. ``However ... I think
they're going to sit on the sidelines a while longer.''
   He and other analysts noted that the wholesale price index does
not measure the cost of services, which are being pushed up by wage
increases resulting from a tight labor market. Services make up
about 55 percent of the consumer index.
   ``We've scarcely made any inroads on services inflation,'' said
economist Robert G. Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.
``The Fed has a classic problem. It's really hard to break
inflation down in the absence of a full-fledged recession.''
   The Labor Department's calculation of overall service costs rose
4.8 percent in the six months ended in November, only marginally
better than the 5.1 percent gain posted in the preceding six months.
   The department said in a separate report that Americans' average
weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, fell 0.7 percent
last month following a 0.6 percent rise in October. The department
attributed the decline to drops in average earnings per hour and
average hours worked per week, in addition to consumer price hikes.
   In another report showing sluggishness, the Commerce Department
said housing starts fell 4.7 percent in November following a 13
percent jump a month earlier.
   Leading the November advance in consumer costs was a 0.6 percent
boost in food prices, the steepest since May. Dairy products jumped
1.7 percent, their third consecutive sharp increase. The price of
fruits and vegetables soared 1.8 percent, the second big gain in a
row.
   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University said the
rise in fruit and vegetable prices was probably temporary but
cautioned that the dairy increase, accounting for about a fourth of
the overall food increase, could persist into next year.
   ``We slaughtered a lot of cows (during the drought) last year
and ... it takes a while to get new cows,'' he said.
   Gasoline prices fell 2.1 percent in November following a 0.9
percent rise in October. However, other forms of energy were more
expensive. The index for natural gas and electricity rose 1.5
percent, while fuel oil edged up 0.2 percent following a big 2.5
percent gain a month earlier. Overall, energy prices fell 0.1
percent last month.
   If colder-than-average winter weather continues, energy prices
could rise over the coming months, Ratajczak warned. The price of
crude oil this week topped $22 a barrel for the first time since
April.
   In other details:
   _The cost of medical care, which has been increasing at an 8.5
percent rate over the last year, was up 0.8 percent in November, in
line with previous increases.
   _Clothing costs edged up 0.1 percent in November, following two
months of steep increases that coincided with the introduction of
fall lines.
   _New-car prices rose 0.8 percent; tobacco was down 0.1 percent,
and entertainment costs climbed 0.2 percent.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer
Price Index stood at 125.9 in November. That meant that a
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the
1982-84 base period would have cost $125.90 last month, up from
$120.30 a year ago.

<HEAD>Navy Chief Rips Lax Safety Procedures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's top admiral, criticizing lax safety
procedures and an attitude of complacency, told his commanders they
must do better to prevent the deadly accidents that plagued the
service in recent months, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   ``The level of effective supervision on the scene was often
inadequate when accidents occurred,'' Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost said
in a letter sent Monday to all Navy commanders.
   ``Taking safety for granted is never acceptable,'' Trost wrote.
``Safety springs from a command attitude and set of priorities that
require an every-day, building-block approach and self-discipline.''
   Trost's findings stem from his evaluation of the Navy's
unprecedented two-day freeze, or stand-down, on routine operations
last month.
   Trost and Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III ordered the
pause in operations in mid-November after 10 accidents at sea and
in the air within three weeks killed 10 Navy personnel and injured
at least 71.
   Under the stand-down order, all Navy units worldwide halted
normal routine and concentrated on safety inspections, reviews and
lectures.
   Afterward, commanders relayed their findings to Trost.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, releasing a statement about
the Navy's study, said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was confident
the service would address the problems.
   ``I'm sure they'll take steps to correct it,'' Williams said.
   Trost ``referred to complacency'' in his letter, and faulted
commanders for exercising poor supervision during the Navy's many
dangerous operations. He told commanders there was no single
element to link the accidents, which ranged from men washed
overboard to plane crashes to ship fires to the accidental bombing
of a cruiser.
   Trost complained that sailors had not been properly taught to do
their jobs, that supervisors lacked safety training and established
safety procedures were not adequately followed. He said those were
all areas where improvements were needed.
   ``The bottom line is that safety of our personnel is a
fundamental obligation and responsibility of leadership,'' Trost
told his commanders. ``One life lost is an unacceptable price. We
simply must do better.''
   During the safety review, naval commanders found problems with
proper planning of their operations, a lack of qualified senior
leaders during operations, proper 24-hour-a-day supervision and
compressed at-sea schedules that precluded proper training for
junior personnel, the Pentagon statement said.
   Attention should be paid to the constant review of all safety
procedures, the proper use of safety publications so sailors don't
have to constantly re-learn safety procedures and the use of
established inspections to reveal improper stowage of dangerous
materials, the statement said.
   The stand-down revealed that there should be increased emphasis
on safety during all training courses, improvement in the quality
of instructors at Navy schools and better use of such safety
instruction techniques as training videotapes.
   There have been 75 major accidents and 104 fatalities this year.
However, that includes the 47 sailors killed in the April 19 gun
turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa.
   According to Navy figures, 1988 was the safest year on record
with 63 fatalities. In comparison, there were 118 major accidents
reported with 64 fatalities in 1984.

   In an age of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and
Nintendo, two women who started a toy company in their basement
have created a growing business that relies on an endless source of
entertainment _ a child's imagination.
   Phyllis Brody and Evelyn Greenwald, owners of Creative Art
Activities Inc., banked on children's curiosity and ingenuity when
they founded Creativity for Kids in 1979.
   ``So many of the other toys are entertaining you ... With our
toys, rather than a child being passive, they participate,'' said
Mrs. Brody, 53, a former social worker. ``People go into one of the
toy supermarkets and buy what the kids says they want from
television ads rather than buying something that is more in line
with the kids' interests.''
   The idea has paid off. The business has moved into a Cleveland
warehouse as sales have increased 30 to 40 percent each of the last
five years. The two Cleveland Heights owners say it is accurate to
estimate that sales exceeded $2 million in 1989, though they
decline to give specific sales figures.
   The company's 40 kits contain materials to transform old boxes
into cars or dollhouses, safety pins and sequins into bracelets and
cardboard tubes and clothespins into dolls, puppets and monsters.
   Harry Guckert, publisher of Playthings, the New York-based trade
magazine founded in 1903 for the toy industry, said Creativity for
Kids has carved out a special niche in the toy market.
   ``Creativity for Kids is excellent,'' Guckert said. ``We call
them specialty retailers. The two gals have researched the market
and their company is strong. There are a lot of companies in this
differentiated market that are not.''
   The company's products have won seven Parents' Choice awards, a
toy industry award for excellence.
   Many of the kits are just a collection of household items, the
kind of stuff parents used to assemble for play on a rainy day _
feathers, glue, colored paper, corks, paint, fabric, wood and yarn,
said Ms. Greenwald, 49, a lawyer. She said the kits satisfy the
needs of working parents who don't have the time to round up craft
items but still want to offer children creative opportunities.
   Ten employees work at company headquarters, mailing orders to
about 1,000 small toy shops nationwide that feature educational and
specialty products.
   The employees order hundreds of pounds of feathers, millions of
wiggly eyes, pine cones and an array of other items. The suppliers
ship the items to a sheltered workshop program where handicapped
workers assemble the toy kits.
   Aimed at children 4 and older, the kits range in price from $3
for a party favors kit to $25 for a pre-cut doll bed. The product
line is inexpensive in an industry with annual sales of $12 billion.
   ``The kits are a combination of facts, playing and learning.
They make up their own rules _ no one tells them how to do it,''
Ms. Brody said.
   For $7.95, the Let's Pretend Travel Kit includes maps,
passports, postcards and tickets. The Let's Pretend Restaurant
offers dinnerware, menus, placemats, order pads and other items
needed for a restaurant.
   Other kits include the ingredients to make a personalized
T-shirt, hat or masks or items to operate a hotel or supermarket.

   David Register rose with the sun
Tuesday and by 7 a.m. his pickup was gleaming under a cloudless
sky. Neighbor Allan Edwards was already spraying fertilizer and
water on new sod patches and palm trees.
   ``Man, I'd usually be sleeping now,'' Register, 19, said as he
hosed suds from the truck's hood.
   By the dawn's early light, residents of southern Florida
sprinkled their lawns and scrubbed their cars under mandatory
water-use restrictions that limit such activities to early-morning
hours on certain days.
   ``It's a little inconvenience, sure,'' said Edwards. ``But the
alternative _ no water _ is a lot worse.''
   The restrictions, drafted in response to the region's worst
drought in 27 years, took effect Monday and limit home car washing
and lawn watering to 4 a.m. to 8 a.m. for the more than 4 million
people from Jupiter to Key West.
   Residents of even-numbered addresses were allowed the water-use
privilege Tuesday. Odd-numbered homes can open the tap early
Wednesday.
   Police and water management officials say no $25 violation fines
were issued Monday, but no records were kept for first-time
warnings.
   ``People have generally responded very quickly, and I'm
impressed with that,'' said Bruce Adams, water shortage coordinator
for the South Florida Water Management District.
   In Miami, Metro-Dade police Detective Donald Blocker said
officers will not actively seek out violators but will investigate
complaints.
   ``We don't have a special task force or anything,'' he said.
``We'll be looking into reports on a low-priority basis.''
   Water managers are seeking a 15 percent reduction in the nearly
745 million gallons of water used each day in Palm Beach, Broward,
Dade and Monroe counties. Later this week, officials will determine
if the cutbacks are successful.
   For the time being, water officials are busy answering
questions. Nearly 900 calls an hour were registered Monday at the
water management district's West Palm Beach office.
   As of Tuesday, the National Weather Service in Miami reported
42.31 inches of rain this year, more than 14.4 inches below normal.
That compared to 42.23 inches in 1962 and 41.78 inches in 1961,
according to weather service records.
   Some sections of Florida's southeast coast are 33 inches below
normal rainfall amounts, and most are off by at least 15 inches.
   In addition, much of the region has had record high temperatures
in the mid- to upper 80s since Monday.
   Mandatory water restrictions have been in effect since February
in the 16-county Southwest Florida Water Management District, which
includes the Tampa Bay area. The Palatka-based St. Johns River
district in northern Florida adopted restrictions in August.
   The restrictions in South Florida are the most extensive since
1981, the area's last major drought.
   Pressure on the region's water system is exacerbated by seasonal
tourists, who swell beachside populations.
   ``If Florida's in trouble, we have to do our part,'' said Sal
Crocco, 70, of Albany, N.Y., who washed his car about 6:30 a.m.
near Fort Lauderdale Beach. ``Visitors use water, too.''
   But Alex Green, a New York City resident who has been coming to
Miami Beach since the 1970s, said he does not believe the large
tourist hotels will turn off sprinklers and decorative fountains.
   ``You think they want dead trees and brown grass?'' he said.
``They'd rather pay a fine than lose customers.''
   At Deluxe Wash &amp; Wax Inc. in Oakland Park, only a few additional
cars arrived Monday, said manager Phil Rinland. Car washes that
recycle water are not affected by the restrictions.
   ``Nobody's going to listen to a $25 fine,'' he said. ``You got
to hit them with $100, then $500, if you really want people to pay
attention to this. As long as water is coming out of the tap,
people are not going to take this seriously.''

   An Amtrak train carrying at least 144
passengers plowed into a tractor-trailer in dense fog, derailed and
exploded today, killing three people and critically injuring 17,
authorities reported.
   The engineer and fireman of the locomotive were killed when the
engine careened off the tracks, overturned and exploded, the
California Highway Patrol said. The CHP said the driver of the
truck was also killed.
   CHP spokesman Bob Whitmire said 54 passengers were injured. He
said 23 seriously injured people were taken by ambulance to
hospitals, and 31 others were taken by bus to hospitals for
examination and treatment of minor injuries.
   ``They still are fighting the fire in the engine,'' said Ron
Baldwin of the San Joaquin Office of Emergency Services. ``They had
a large fire in the engine itself and we're trying to get people
out of the train in case there is an explosion.
   ``One problem is we have heavy fog and we're not able to air
transport victims and it's making it a little more complex.''
   Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd said the train was going about 70
mph when it hit the truck, which apparently had ``ignored the
lights and went right in front of the train.'' The train was en
route from Oakland to Bakersfield.
   ``Our information is that the road crossing is protected by
gates, bells and flashing lights,'' Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin
said at railroad heaquarters in Washington. ``We do not know why
the truck was on the tracks. We know the accident occurred id one car was
on its side.
   It was unknown whether tule fog _ an extremely dense wintertime
fog that has made San Joaquin Valley roads dangerous in recent days
_ was a factor. Visibility was zero at the time of the accident,
the National Weather Service said.
   Dense fog caused a 69-vehicle pileup near Tracy west of Stockton
Monday morning, and a series of accidents involved 55 vehicles
farther south in Merced County.

<HEAD>Study Says Low-Level Radiation Greater Cancer Risk Than Earlier Thought</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A National Research Council report said
Tuesday that cancer risks from low level X-ray and gamma ray
radiation are three to four times greater than earlier believed, a
finding that may lead to new standards for workers in nuclear
industries.
   However, Arthur C. Upton, chairman of the NRC committee that
made the study, said, ``The average citizen should not view this as
a source of great concern.''
   Upton said he expects that agencies worldwide that set industry
radiation exposure standards will reassess the risks as a result of
the NRC study. Although he said the committee did not recommend
changes, he did say, ``I personally expect that there will be
changes.''
   The committee reassessed the health effects of low-level
radiation using new data developed from studies of survivors from
the World War II atomic bombings in Japan; from other ``irridated
populations,'' such as workers in atomic industries, and from
animals studies.
   Experts on the committee also revised previous mathematical
methods of estimating risks from low-level radiation.
   Using the new information and methods, the committee concluded
that the risk for solid tumor cancer is three times greater than an
earlier NRC estimate, and the risk for leukemia is four times
greater.
   The committee also found a much greater danger for mental
retardation among unborn babies exposed to low-level radiation in
the eighth to 15th weeks after conception.
   The committee found that women are slightly more likely than men
to develop cancer from low levels of radiation, and that in some
types of cancer, children are more susceptible to radiation's
effects than are adults.
   Upton, who is chairman of the Department of Environmental
Medicine at New York University Medical Center, said the study
``merely endorses earlier reports that we really don't know that
there is a safe level'' of radiation exposure.
   He emphasized that the findings should not prevent patients from
receiving appropriate diagnostic X-rays or treatments because the
added risk from such medical radiation is very slight.
   ``A chest X-ray might increase (an individual's) risk by 1 in a
million,'' he said. ``It's essentially negligible. But it's not
negligible to public health authorities'' who analyze risks for the
population as a whole.
   Unneccessary X-rays, however, said Upton, ``should be avoided.''
   Seymour Jablon, a National Cancer Institute scientist who was on
the NRC committee, said ``the bottom line is that you ought to
avoid radiation whenever you can. But there are certain benefits,
such as medical X-rays, that outweigh the risk.''
   Many of the study's conclusions are based partly on the medical
history of 76,000 survivors of the 1945 atomic bombings in Japan, a
factor that powerfully influenced the new cancer risk estimates.
   Previously, the committee said, neutron radiation was
erroneously considered to have a major influence on the health of
the A-bomb survivors. Removing neutrons from the equation, it said,
means that the survivors are experiencing higher rates of cancer
from lower radiation doses.
   This is interpreted by the committee to mean that there is an
increased risk of cancer and other health problems from low-level
radiation.
   Dose and duration of exposure generally determine health
effects, the committee said.
   In the United States, for instance, natural background radiation
gives an exposure of 0.1 to 0.3 REMs a year. REM stands for ``rad
equivalent in man'' and is a unit of measure used to describe a
biological effect from a level of radiation exposure.
   A routine chest X-ray gives an added exposure of 0.06 REM;
occupational standards limit nuclear workers to an annual exposure
of no more than 5 REM.
   The committee estimated that a single burst of 10 REM radiation
exposure will result in 790 excess cancer and leukemia deaths per
100,000 people. For this same exposure, a 1980 National Research
Council report estimated cancer deaths per 100,000 people at 80 to
230..
   For a lifetime radiation exposure of 0.1 REM a year, the new
study estimated 520 male cancer deaths per 100,000 men, and 600
deaths per 100,000 women. The 1980 report estimated cancer deaths
at 25 to 119 for this rate of exposure.
   The NRC, which organized the committee study, is the research
arm of the National Academy of Sciences, a congressionally
chartered private organization that conducts research at the
request of the government.

<HEAD>Congress Backs Gorbachev's Traditional Economic Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov defeated the Soviet
Congress' first try at a no-confidence vote Tuesday and won
overwhelming approval for an economic revival plan based on
traditional socialist methods of state planning.
   Critics say Ryzhkov's plan continues the same bureaucratic
meddling in the economy that after more than 70 years of Soviet
rule has led to widespread shortages of consumer goods, the
rationing of items ranging from meat to matches and a multibillion
ruble state deficit.
   In a dramatic Kremlin showdown, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
interceded from the dais on behalf of his fellow Politburo member,
asking for a clear pledge of support from the 2,250-member Congress
of People's Deputies, or parliament, that is the centerpiece of his
political reforms.
   ``It's a political question: Will we support this government and
what it has introduced, or will we keep the government in such a
state all the time that it cannot begin its work?'' Gorbachev
demanded of the Congress, meeting in the Kremlin Palace of
Congresses.
   Ryzhkov, 60, and his ministers have been a lightning rod for
parliamentary and popular discontent since the Congress and its
smaller working legislature, the Supreme Soviet, began functioning
this summer.
   Progressives say the plan presented by Ryzhkov to the Congress
Dec. 13 is a triumph for bureaucrats and conservatives, since it
rejects more radical proposals by the premier's top economist,
Leonid Abalkin, for selling off money-losing state enterprises and
urgent measures to free some prices from state controls.
   Although the Kremlin allows its East European allies virtual
free rein in reforming their economies, Ryzhkov's plan shows its
deep-seated reluctance to abandon government levers controlling its
own economy that date to the reign of dictator Josef Stalin and
earlier.
   Instead, Ryzhkov's proposals shift central planning from its
traditional emphasis on heavy industry to consumer goods as a way
of filling chronically empty store shelves.
   Yuri Andreev, a Moscow engineer, called on the Congress to
express its lack of confidence in Ryzhkov's government by asking it
to draft a new economic reform plan and to fire the officials who
drafted the orginal version.
   The normally cool and composed Ryzhkov, his voice cracking with
emotion, pleaded with the deputies for clear-cut support. ``The
Congress should not avoid making an evaluation,'' he said. ``It
must express its firm position: either to support the government's
proposals ... or some other formulation.''
   After his appeal, the no-confidence measure was voted down 1,685
to 199, with 99 abstentions. A separate vote on the economic plan,
which includes emergency measures as well as guidelines for the
1991-95 13th five-year plan, was approved 1,532 to 419, with 44
deputies abstaining.
   Ryzhkov stood and clasped his hands in victory as members of the
Congress applauded. He had hinted in a newspaper interview printed
Sunday that he would leave office if the plan were not approved.
   Abalkin was quoted by the official Tass news agency as saying
all members of the Council of Ministers that Ryzhkov heads were
``ready to resign immediately'' if the proposal failed to win the
Congress' backing.
   Though Andreev's proposal was defeated, it was the latest sign
of feistiness by lawmakers in the Gorbachev age, and a stark
contrast with the unanimous approval once given every proposal the
Kremlin leadership put to a vote.
   In its afternoon session, the Congress showed its combativeness
again by not giving the leadership the needed majority for a
proposed constitutional amendment that would have continued special
parliamentary representation for Gorbachev's Communist Party and
other officially sanctioned organizations.
   So-called ``social organizations'' are now empowered to elect
750 Congress members, with the other two-thirds of the deputies
chosen in competitive elections nationwide. The organizations'
special representation has provoked discontent among deputies who
have to go in front of voters.
   The editorial commission of the Congress, headed by party
ideologue Vadim A. Medvedev, proposed amending the Constitution to
say that special representatives ``may be'' elected by social
organizations, replacing the automatic guarantee of 750 Congress
seats.
   That language was considered too tepid by deputies who want the
special provision eliminated. The proposed amendment received only
1,078 ``yes'' votes, more than 400 short of the two-thirds majority
required for such a measure. Of the other deputies, 810 voted
against and 44 abstained.
   At Gorbachev's urging, the Congress also passed a decree
instructing the Supreme Soviet to pass a raft of laws by February
that are considered crucial to the Kremlin leader's plans for
economic reform.
   Progressives originally wanted the laws on property, land,
leasing and other matters debated at the Congress. Yuri Boldyrev of
Leningrad said Gorbachev's move was a tactical victory for
reformers, since conservatives in the Congress could have stymied
action on the laws. But he said the decree sets a ``dangerous
precedent'' by allowing the Supreme Soviet to do work that should
be done by the Congress.

<HEAD>New `Learnfare' Program Gets Mixed Reception</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Katie Cooper, a single parent on
welfare, says she had hit rock bottom a year ago before a state
program that tied welfare benefits to her son's school attendance
changed her life.
   Learnfare, introduced in March 1988, aims to keep teen-agers
from welfare families in school by threatening to cut the family's
welfare benefits when a child is truant.
   The program has its critics, but Ms. Cooper isn't one of them.
   Her 17-year-old son, Travis, was on drugs last year and had
missed so many days of school that the family's Aid to Families
with Dependent Children was about to be cut.
   ``Things looked so bleak,'' Ms. Cooper said. ``I thought, `How
the hell was I gonna pay the bills?'''
   AFDC benefits in Wisconsin range from $249 to $983 a month,
depending on the family's size. Learnfare cuts those benefits by
$20 to $192 a month for each month a family's child or children
fail to regularly attend school. Food stamps and other public
assistance programs are not affected.
   The threat of losing part of their benefits forced Ms. Cooper
and her son to change their ways.
   Travis, a senior, has improved his grades from F's to C's and
will graduate in May.
   Although Learnfare didn't make Travis love school, ``it kept him
there,'' Ms. Cooper said. ``That's what's important.''
   And Ms. Cooper, who battled drug addiction and an abusive
marriage before setting out on her own 11 years ago, has attended a
two-year college, while working part time as a waitress, and will
receive a degree in marketing this month.
   About 2,200 of the estimated 30,000 teen-agers whose families
receive AFDC have been penalized each month.
   Critics claim the threat of losing benefits gives troublesome
teen-agers a tool by which to hold their parents hostage.
   ``It forces families and children to lie, to commit fraud for
the money they need to live on. (It) keeps people in that vicious
circle,'' said Geneva Johnson, president of Family Service America,
a Milwaukee-based social service organization.
   Supporters, however, argue education is the first step to
breaking the cycle of welfare dependency and that Learnfare is a
strong tool to encourage students to get an education.
   Patricia Goodrich, secretary of the state Department of Health
and Social Services, which oversees Learnfare, said the program has
``brought to the attention of AFDC recipients that education is
important.''
   The state has applied to the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services to expand the program to include children in elementary
school.
   Dorthea Harrington, a program manager for the federal agency's
regional office in Chicago, said no decision has been made on the
application and that the government has not yet evaluated Learnfare.
   Nancy Campbell, a branch chief for Health and Human Services in
Washington, said no other state has asked permission to implement
Learnfare although some have expressed an interest.
   She said Ohio has enacted a program somewhat similar to
Learnfare, but that program uses incentive payments rather than
benefit cuts to encourage welfare recipients to stay in school.
   In Wisconsin, schools are given lists of children whose families
receive AFDC and they notify Mrs. Goodrich's agency when one of
those students has three or more unexcused absences in a month.
   The agency warns the family benefits will be cut for the next
month and the deduction is made if the family does not appeal.
Families may appeal on the grounds that there were extenuating
circumstances for the absences, that the cuts will cause undue
hardship on the family or that attendance records were incorrect.
   Legal Action of Wisconsin Inc. of Milwaukee, a legal advocacy
group, recently filed suit challenging Learnfare's
constitutionality. It has handled appeals for about 200 to 250
families and won about 75 percent of the cases.
   Patricia DeLessio, an attorney for the group, said one criticism
of the program is that the welfare cuts do nothing to meet the
needs of troubled students who miss school.
   School officials ``don't sit down with the teen-agers and find
out what the problem is and try to provide services to meet their
needs,'' she said.
   Mrs. Goodrich said efforts to investigate the reasons for
truancy are part of the proposal to expand Learnfare.
   ``There's a concern that there's a real reason for the majority
of these youngsters missing school,'' she said.

   Prince Charles used Shakespeare's ``Hamlet'' to
illustrate the decline of the English language into what he called
impoverished, sloppy banalities and cliches.
   The prince said English had been the medium for some of the
greatest literature in the world, including that of William
Shakespeare, whom he called probably the greatest playwright that
ever lived.
   But the state of modern English led the prince to wonder how
Shakespeare's Hamlet would have delivered his famous ``To be, or
not to be'' soliloquy in today's language.
   This is what Hamlet says in Act III, Scene 1, of the play,
``Hamlet, Prince of Denmark.''
   To be, or not to be: that is the question:
   Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
   The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
   Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
   And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
   No more; and, by a sleep to say we end
   The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
   That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
   Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
   To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
   For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
   When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
   Must give us pause.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Here is Prince Charles' version of how the soliloquy would be
written in today's English:
   Well, frankly, the problem as I see it
   At this moment in time is whether I
   Should just lie down under all this hassle
   And let them walk all over me,
   Or, whether I should just say: `OK,
   I get the message,' and do myself in.
   I mean, let's face it, I'm in a no-win
   Situation, and quite honestly,
   I'm so stuffed up to here with the whole
   Stupid mess that, I can tell you, I've just
   Got a good mind to take the quick way out.
   That's the bottom line. The only problem is:
   What happens if I find that when I've bumped
   Myself off, there's some kind of a, you know,
   All that mystical stuff about when you die,
   You might find you're still _ know what I mean?

   Sen. Alan Cranston will be married for
the third time in a Christmas Eve ceremony to a woman he met 21
years ago.
   Cranston, 75, plans a weekend wedding and a honeymoon in ``a
private spot in Northern California,'' he said after he and Cathy
Lee Pattiz obtained a marriage license on Monday.
   Cranston and Pattiz, 49, got the license at a county office in
Palo Alto. They will be married Christmas Eve at the home of
Cranston's sister in Los Altos Hills in a ceremony conducted by
U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham, a friend of the senator's.
   Cranston, whose second marriage ended in a divorce last May, has
served in the Senate since 1969. He first met Pattiz in 1968 during
his first senatorial campaign. The marriage will be her first.
   ``The proposal came as a complete surprise to me,'' said Pattiz.
   Cranston, a Democrat, says he will seek re-election in 1992 to a
fifth Senate term. His financial ties to Charles Keating Jr., who
owned the scandal-ridden Lincoln Savings and Loan, are sure to be a
campaign issue, but Cranston says he is confident he will prove he
did nothing improper in connection with the failed savings
institution.

   They spent months and years toiling in
laboratories and stuffy libraries but when it came time to get
their projects to the nation's top science fair, 90 high school
students were a day late.
   Under contest rules, the science papers absolutely, positively
had to be in Washington, D.C., by midnight Friday. But, because of
a Federal Express error, the papers from 90 students at New York's
Stuyvesant High School arrived Monday.
   The students were disqualified from the Westinghouse Science
Talent Search _ until Westinghouse executives in Pittsburgh
intervened.
   ``It just wasn't fair, so we're going to admit them,'' said
Charles Carroll, a Westinghouse spokesman. ``We asked ourselves,
`What's the right thing to do?' Disqualification seemed like an
unfair penalty.''
   ``We're elated!'' said Stuyvesant Assistant Principal Harold
Lehrman. ``After I got the call, the news spread through the school
like wildfire. Everyone was cheering.''
   That included Leland Gershell, who spent the last 18 months
designing and performing an experiment that linked the fluoride
content of dental patients' saliva with their susceptibility to
cavities.
   For a while, Gershell was afraid his work _ he pored over dozens
of scholarly journals and collected and analyzed dozens of vials of
patients' drool _ had been in vain.
   A Stuyvesant teacher sent two boxes to the Westinghouse
competition in Washington last Thursday. One box, containing about
70 papers, arrived the next day, just before the deadline. But the
second box, mailed at the same time and same place, arrived three
days later to be rejected and sent back to New York.
   Federal Express admitted it misrouted the box and sent
Westinghouse an affidavit to that effect. But Carol Luszcz, program
director, said that made no difference.
   Competition applications warn that ``a postmark of Dec. 15 will
not suffice, and packages sent via a guaranteed delivery service
will be refused if they arrive after the deadline.'' There also is
an underlined warning _ ``LATE ENTRIES WILL BE DISQUALIFIED WITHOUT
EXCEPTION'' _ and a recommendation that applicants allow for the
holiday mail crush.
   ``Ever year we get papers late, but we just can't take them,
whether it's the applicant's fault or the mail's fault or God's
fault,'' Ms. Luszcz said before she was overruled by the
Westinghouse Educational Foundation, which pays for the competition.
   One year, she said, about 30 applicants were rejected even
though their applications were delayed by a blizzard in the Midwest.
   Carroll, speaking by telephone from Pittsburgh, said that what
set Stuyvesant apart was what he termed ``the twin boxes ... They
were sent out together, so it was decided to treat them as one.''
   Ms. Luszcz said the deadline was important, because competition
judges begin reading the papers in Washington almost immediately
after the deadline, and that equity required that similar papers be
read by the same judges.
   Carroll said the judges would be reconvened to consider the 90
Stuyvesant papers.
   The Westinghouse competition is the ultimate high school science
fair. The ranks of winners include five Nobel laureates, eight
MacArthur fellows and two winners of the Field Medal, the top prize
in mathematics.
   Of the 1,900 scholarships awarded since 1942, New York City
students have won roughly a quarter. Stuyvesant students are
regularly among the semifinalists, including 26 last year.
   A group of 300 semifinalists will be announced Jan. 17 and 40
finalists on Jan. 26. About $140,000 in scholarships will be doled
out about a month later.
   On Tuesday afternoon Federal Express said it had located the big
cardboard box and was flying it back to Washington. ``It's kind of
a happy ending,'' said Federal Express spokesman Armand Schneider.

<HEAD>Letter of Intent With IMF Completed, Poles Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government and International Monetary
Fund on Tuesday finished drafting a letter of intent on an economic
adjustment plan leading to $700 million in standby loans to Poland,
a Finance Ministry official said.
   The letter should be signed after it is reviewed by senior
government officials, said Deputy Finance Minister Janusz Sawicki,
dismissing suggestions that a delay had arisen.
   ``There are no disappointments. I can say it is going on
schedule,'' Sawicki said. ``Of course, you could always wish for
miracles.''
   An IMF mission headed by European Department head Massimo Russo
left Poland on Tuesday after completing the agreement that requires
Poland to embark on tough economic reforms to get the IMF credits.
   There was no reason to initial the letter right away, said
Sawicki, who took part in the negotiations on the Polish side.
   Asked whether the IMF aid will arrive in time to assist Poland
as it undertakes economic reform scheduled to begin Jan. 1, Sawicki
said several Western countries probably would offer a bridge loan
in the interim before the first IMF installment arrives.
   He said he also hoped a $1 billion stabilization loan being
prepared by Western countries to back the Polish currency would be
ready early next year.
   ``Every hour is now being counted,'' he said.
   The letter of intent is to be reviewed by senior members of the
Solidarity-led government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki
before its signing, Sawicki said. After it is signed, it is to be
sent to IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus and the IMF board of
executive directors in Washington.
   Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and Polish National
Bank president Wladyslaw Baka will sign the letter for the Polish
side, the state PAP news agency reported.
   The agreement, which Mazowiecki's government has been
negotiating since it took office in September, is tied to the
sweeping economic reform program that the governent introduced in
parliament Sunday.
   It calls for strict measures to balance the budget, decontrol
prices, limit wages, break monopolies, introduce partial
convertibility of the zloty and privatize state industries.
   The agreement will certify to Western leaders that Poland is
making serious efforts to put its economy in order, and is expected
to result immediately in $300 million in World Bank loans and about
$3 billion in other Western aid.
   The holders of Poland's $40 billion Western debt also are
expected to agree to rescheduling part of that debt.
   The progress in talks with the IMF came on the third day of a
Parliament debate concerning the radical economic reform program
Balcerowicz submitted Sunday.
   For the second straight day, the debate was dominated by
deputies from rural areas complaining the budget does not do enough
to help farmers obtain agricultural inputs such as farm machinery,
pesticides and fertilizers, and that the government should set
minimum prices for farm produce.
   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki said he sympathized with
many of the complaints about lack of government funds for
agriculture. But he said that the state's finances would not allow
anymore at present.
   ``It is impossible to do everything overnight,'' he said.
   As the Sejm, or lower house of Parliament, debated throughout
the day, a 43-member extraordinary commission set up to review the
government's economic package was meeting behind closed doors.
   Deputies said the commission would be doing much of the real
work on analyzing the package, which would then be put to a vote of
the full Sejm sometime after Christmas.

<TEXT>
   An army patrol attacked a jungle camp of
pro-Cuban guerrillas, killing 43 and recovering a large cache of
arms and supplies, officials said Tuesday.
   A spokesman for the military command in Lima said one army
sergeant was killed and two soldiers were wounded in the battle
with rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the battle
took place Sunday in a remote jungle region along the Iscozacin
River, 175 miles northeast of Lima in Pasco department.
   The spokesman said army troops recovered arms and explosives as
well as radios, medicine, tents, uniforms and food.
   Sunday's battle was the most serious defeat for the rebels since
April 28, when an army patrol wiped out a column of 62 guerrillas
on a mountain road near Jauja, 105 miles east of Lima.
   The guerrilla movement, which advocates a Cuban-style Marxism,
has been fighting Peru's elected government since 1984. Estimates
of the size of the organization range from 500 to 1,500.
   It is smaller and considered less violent than the Shining Path,
a fanatical, Maoist guerrilla group that launched its insurgency in
1980.
   The government says more than 17,000 people have died in the
violence since 1980, including police, soldiers, rebels, government
officials and civilians.

<TEXT>
   The socialist candidate for president
bitterly conceded defeat Tuesday after official election returns
showed his conservative rival, Fernando Collor de Mello, was the
clear winner in the weekend vote.
   ``Collor de Mello won the election, but he won't do anything he
promised during the campaign,'' said Luis Inacio Lula da Silva.
``He will govern in favor of big business, the armed forces and the
International Monetary Fund.'' Da Silva said his Workers Party and
other left-wing parties that backed him will form a ``shadow
government to prevent Collor de Mello from commiting abuses.''
   Collor de Mello has refused to make a victory speech until the
winner is officially announced by the Superior Electoral Court.
That is expected Wednesday.
   With 93.9 percent of the vote counted, official returns showed
Collor de Mello with 32,884,545 votes, or 43.7 percent, and da
Silva with 29,975,927 votes, or 38.9 percent.
   Officials said the remaining ballots were blank or improperly
filled out and considered null.
   ``The president-elect is anxious to speak to the nation, but he
will only do so when the (Elecotral) Court confirms his victory,''
said Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva, Collor de Mello's press
spokesman.
   Leaders of Collor de Mello's 10-month-old National
Reconstruction Party met with outgoing President Jose Sarney's
economic ministers and began negotiating alliances with political
leaders.
   The rightist party, with less than 3 percent of seats in
Congress, lacks legislative weight needed to take emergency
measures to revive the economy. Brazil's annual inflation rate is
1,500 percent, and it's $110 billion foreign debt is the biggest in
the Third World.
   ``We are going to form a government of national unity, excluding
no one,'' said Renan Calheiros, Collor de Mello's chief adviser.
   Collor de Mello was also trying to open channels of
communication with the liberal wing of the Roman Catholic Church,
unions and leftist parties that backed da Silva.
   Workers Party officials appeared to reject any offer of
conciliation.
   ``Mr. Collor de Mello has a program and suporters that conflict
with our program and with the way of handling politics in Brazil,''
said party president Luiz Gushiken. ``There's no sense in us
joining a Collor government.''
   Meanwhile, Sarney said he would step down from office early if
Congress votes to shorten his five-year mandate.
   ``If the Congress wishes, I won't be an obstacle,'' said Sarney,
a civilian who took office in 1985 in an Electoral College vote
coordinated by the country's top generals.
   The president-elect is scheduled to succeed Sarney for a
five-year term March 15, 1990, but pressure is mounting for Sarney
to resign early. On Sunday, two Cabinet ministers said the new
president should take office soon to adopt economic measures.
   The election Sunday marked the return of democratic rights after
a right-wing miltiary regime ruled from 1964 to 1985.
   The 82 million-member electorate also passed judgment on two
decades of rapid but unequal growth, which led to the economic
problems.
   Collor de Mello and da Silva were the top vote-getters in a
field of 21 candidates in first-round balloting Nov. 15. Neither
obtained a majority needed to win, and the two went to a runoff
election.
   Da Silva called for immediate suspension of payments on the
foreign debt, land and urban reforms and redistribution of wealth.
   The Workers Party candidate won in most major cities.
   Collor de Mello, 40, a free market advocate who pledged a
crackdown on corruption in government, won a huge majority among
uneducated rural voters in the impoverished north and northeast.
   The last popularly elected president of Brazil was Janio
Quadros. He abruptly resigned in 1961 after seven months in office,
citing ``occult forces.''
   In 1964 the military overthrew Quadros' successor, liberal
vice-president Joao Goulart, and ruled until 1985.

   The Energy Department gave the new operator of
the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant $3.9 million in award fees
despite serious safety lapses such as workers found sleeping on
duty, the agency said Tuesday.
   The award for Westinghouse Savannah River Co.'s first six months
at the site near Aiken, S.C., amounted to 52.5 percent of the
maximum possible award under terms of its contract, the department
said in a letter to Westinghouse last Wednesday.
   The contract provides for incentive payments, or award fees, if
the contractor meets criteria set by the department.
   Westinghouse took over for E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. in
April amid concern that Du Pont had allowed safety standards to
fall dangerously low. Du Pont had run the plant since it was built
in the early 1950s.
   In the letter, P.W. Kaspar, manager of the department's Savannah
River operations office, told Westinghouse Savannah River President
James Moore that while the company had made some important
improvements, its overall approach to instilling greater discipline
in plant operations was too narrow and not yet effective.
   Kaspar said the department's Award Fee Board, which evaluated
Westinghouse's performance from April 1 through Sept. 30, had
assigned a rating of 82 points out of a possible 100. Kaspar
personally knocked one point off the rating, resulting in an award
total of $3.9 million out of a maximum possible $7.5 million.
   ``The reason for this reduction was my assessment that progress
made to date on improving conduct of operations is inadequate and
not sufficiently reflected in the (board's) evaluation,'' Kaspar
wrote.
   ``While training programs appear to be sound, there is
insufficient on-shift coaching, rigorous enforcement of details and
followup of anomalies throughout the site,'' he added.
   Among the anomalies cited by Kaspar was employees found sleeping
on the job.
   Kaspar's letter provided no details, but plant spokesman Dean
Hoffman said Tuesday that two employees, in separate incidents, had
been found asleep when they were supposed to have been monitoring
the testing of cooling pipes at the L reactor, one of three
reactors at Savannah River that make a gas needed for nuclear
warheads.
   All three reactors have been shut down for more than a year for
safety improvements.
   Hoffman said unspecified ``disciplinary action'' was taken
against the employees several months ago, although they were not
fired.
   Kaspar attributed the sleeping incidents to excessive overtime
required by Westinghouse.
   Another problem noted by Kaspar was the intentional disablement
of alarms by Westinghouse employees.
   Hoffman said two employees recently were fired for tampering
with alarms in two areas of the plant, including the P reactor. The
alarms were installed to detect excessive amounts of radiation.
   Hoffman called the sleeping and alarm tampering ``isolated
incidents'' and said the company had made important strides toward
reaching Energy Department standards for operating the plant. He
added that the company would not be satisfied with its overall
performance until it reached the department's highest standards.
   Hoffman noted that the department had given Westinghouse an
``excellent'' rating for establishing and operating an integrated
design, engineering and construction organization. Ratings in other
areas were either ``good'' or ``marginal.''

   The Coast Guard's failure to require life
rafts and signal beacons on small, commercial passenger boats
contributed to the loss of life in the sinking of a vessel off the
Oregon coast, the National Transportation Safety Board concluded
Tuesday.
   It was the first time the board has cited what it considers a
laxity in Coast Guard regulations as a contributory cause to an
accident it investigated.
   The board, on a 3-0 vote with one member absent, placed primary
blame for the accident on the vessel's captain, who was not
identified.
   The board also blamed the Coast Guard for failing in its
inspections to confirm whether hatchcovers on the 46-foot Cougar
were watertight before the Sept. 15, 1988, sinking, which led to
the deaths of the boat's captain, a deckhand and two passengers.
   One died 15 minutes before a helicopter rescued a ship's mate
and the boat's four remaining passengers, who had floated in the
cold water 35 miles west of Depoe Bay for 18 hours, investigators
said.
   The board said the Cougar's captain had failed to ensure that
hatchcovers were watertight, that the bilge pump was operating
properly and that rubber flaps designed to let water flow off the
deck were correctly installed.
   The flaps were on the wrong side, preventing water from flowing
off the deck, investigators said. The ship sank in moderately heavy
seas while returning from a fishing trip, after its crew and
passengers tried for 90 minutes to bail out the ship with buckets.
   The board estimates that more than 4,700 commercial vessels
capable of carrying 300,000 passengers fall under the same
regulations as the Cougar.
   The board for years has recommended that the Coast Guard require
all commercial boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all
passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that
emergency positon-indicating radio beacons, or EPRIBs, be carried
on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers.
   In the last five years, the board has investigated five
passenger vessel accidents, including two collisions, one fire, one
capsizing and one grounding. In each case, Coast Guard survival
craft requirements were found inadequate, but there has been no
change.
   The board recommended that the Coast Guard require that within
five years all floation devices and buoyant apparatus be replaced
by lifeboats, life rafts or inflatable devices that can keep people
out of the water.
   The problem is that floatation devices require that passengers
remain in the water, where they can suffer from a rapid loss of
body heat, or hypothermia.
   The board also advised the Coast Guard to improve its testing
rules and procedures and to require all passenger vessel operators
to file sailing plans before they set out.

<HEAD>More U.S. Wheat for Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Soviet Union will be able to buy an
additional 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized
prices, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder said the wheat will be made
available under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or
EEP. The new amount is in addition to 14,200 tons Moscow had
remaining under a previous allocation announced last May 2.
   The Soviet Union is committed to buy minimum quantities of wheat
and corn under a long-term grain agreement, which began its seventh
year on Oct. 1 and will expire Dec. 31, 1990. Moscow has bought
about 800,000 tons of wheat for delivery in 1989-90, according to
USDA records.
   Nearly 11 million tons of corn have been sold for 1989-90
delivery, along with soybeans and soybean meal.
   In 1988-89, the sixth period under the agreement, the Soviet
Union bought about 5.4 million tons of wheat and more than 16.3
million tons of corn, plus soybeans, soybean meal and grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat.
   The EEP arrangement allows private exporters to sell wheat and
other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced
prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then
collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as
bonuses, or subsidies.
   Since EEP began in 1985, more than $2.6 billion in subsidies has
been paid to exporters to ship a variety of commodities to overseas
customers. As of Nov. 30, sales totaled 87.2 million tons of grain,
including 64.4 million tons of wheat.
   The Soviet Union, as the largest EEP beneficiary, has bought
more than 17.5 million tons of wheat. China is second at 13.2
million tons of wheat, plus 185 head of cattle.

   The United States on Tuesday condemned the
violent suppression of political dissent in Romania, saying the
Bush administration is reviewing its already limited relationship
with the hard-line East Bloc country.
   ``We call upon the Romanian government to cease these outrageous
policies and allow its citizens freely to exercise their
fundamental human rights,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said, reading an official statement denouncing ``the
brutal use of security forces against the people of Timisoara.''
   The extent of the weekend violence in Timisoara, a city 500
miles west of Bucharest, was difficult to determine because the
government was apparently suppressing news of the events, she said.
   Two U.S. Embassy officials have been sent from Bucharest to try
to get first-hand information, she said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also harshly criticized
the Romanian government.
   ``The demonstrations in Timisoara and elsewhere were a result of
the systematic denial of human rights to the people of Romania,
particularly to members of the Hungarian minority,'' Fitzwater said
Tuesday.
   ``The repressive measures undertaken by the Romanian government
are totally unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive
changes taking place elsewhere in Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said U.S. Ambassador Alan Green will await the
report from the Embassy officials and the return of leader Nicolae
Ceaucescu from an official trip to Iran before deciding whether to
file an official diplomatic protest.
   ``The demonstrations were an obvious manifestation of broad
popular discontent with the policies of the Romanian government and
a clear expression of the Romanian people's desire to join their
neighbors in embracing democratic reform and economic freedom,''
the State Department statement said.
   ``It is sadly regrettable that Romania remains the only Warsaw
Pact country to reject all political and economic reforms,'' as
well as the only signatory to the Helsinki human rights accord to
refuse to acknowledge the commitments it made under that agreement,
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   She said international borders and the Bucharest airport have
been closed to foreign visitors and all international telephone
lines into Romania were getting busy signals.
   The few U.S. citizens in Timisoara known to the Embassy are
safe, she said.
   The United States, Ms. Tutwiler said, is coordinating its
response to the Romanian crackdown with NATO and European Economic
Community allies.
   ``I can tell you we are currently reassessing our bilateral
relationship, including economic, scientific and other areas to
determine if there are other actions which can be meaningfully
taken,'' she said.
   U.S. trade with Romania has declined by half since 1988 when it
renounced most-favored-nation status to get out from under U.S.
freedom-of-emigration requirements the status imposes. The only
trade remaining is about $300 million annually, primarily imports
of Romanian refined petroleum products.
   ``Our relations have deteriorated seriously since then,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said.

   Lithuania's Communist Party leader
Tuesday urged a united political front with other parties to press
for sovereignty and protect the Baltic republic from Kremlin
pressure.
   Algirdas Brazauskas, in an address to more than 1,000 delegates
at the opening session of the Lithuanian Communist Party Congress,
avoided calling for an immediate, direct break with the Soviet
Communist Party or for Lithuanian indepenence. But he left open
both possibilities.
   Lithuania, he said, saw itself as part a union of Soviet
republics undergoing a radical transformation under President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms that ``will allow us to build a
Soviet Union from which we can secede if we wanted to.''
   Gorbachev has spoken out against plans to split the Lithuanian
party from the national Communist Party and to restore the
independent Lithuanian state that existed between the World Wars.
But the Lithuanians have continued to press for more autonomy, and
an initial step Dec. 7 removed constitutional language that made
the Communist Party the leading force in society.
   The national Congress of People's Deputies last week refused to
discuss such a move, but Communist parties in Eastern Europe
already have given up that special status as change sweeps the
region.
   Brazauskas told the delegates in a nearly 1{-hour speech: ``Only
with an independent Communist Party is it possible to compete
normally and on an equal footing with oher political forces.''
   ``Political power is achieved only through democratic
elections,'' he added.
   Romas Gudaitis, a Lithuanian writer, said separation was
justified because ``the Soviet Commuinist Party is still mired in
Stalinism.''
   Brazauskas said the Lithuanian party, freed from its
subordination to Moscow, was prepared to cooperate with the
powerful political movement Sajudis and other parties in a ``united
front'' to govern the republic of 3.7 million people.
   ``Practically all parties in Lithuania today proclaim the same,
or practically the same, goals,'' he said.
   Those newly formed parties include the Social Democrats and a
party advocating outright independence from the Soviet Union.
   ``A united front, if it became truly united and consolidated
Lithuania, would be a good counterbalance to any attempts from
outside to restrict our achievments,'' he said in an obvious
reference to fears that Moscow might try to limit Lithuania's drive
for sovereignty.
   Progressive Communist leaders in Lithuania and the other Baltic
republics of Latvia and Estonia, are already closely identified
with Sajudis and other people's fronts organizations, but
Brazauskas' proposal was to extend and formalize that relationship,
apparently to make the Communist Party a coalition partner.
   Arvydas Juozaitis, a member of the Sajudis governing council,
told reporters that Sajudis was not interested in a united front.
   ``I'm not sure they are absolutely acceptable to us under this
name,'' he said.
   The Communist Party, regardless of what decision it makes at
this week's congress, is nearly dead, he said. ``They are reburying
a dead body in another grave, from a Soviet grave to a national
grave,'' he said.
   Juozaitis added, however, that it was ``very possible'' the
Lithuanian Communist Party would soon change its name.
   Lithuanian leaders have said they needed to compete in Feb. 24
local elections and that requires them to develop a program
independent of Moscow.
   Many local Communist leaders in March were beaten badly in
elections to the national Congress of People's Deputies because
they were too closely identified with decades of Moscow's
heavy-handed policies.
   Although the party's proposed rules do not mention any firm
relationship with the Soviet party, Brazauskas vowed their would be
no immediate break with it.
   ``The declaration and legitimization of the statutes of the
independent Lithuanian Communist Party does not mean breaking off
the relationship with the Soviet Communist, but reshaping it and
(making) a transition from subordination to partnership,'' the
party said in a draft document.
   Outside, hundreds of people gathered on the steps of the opera
and ballet theater where the Congress was being held. They carried
red, green and yellow Lithuanian flags and banners backing the
party's proposed independence from Moscow.
   A small group of demonstrators marched down Gediminas Avenue,
the main street, to protest even a reformed Communist Party. One
sign proclaimed, ``Stop Communism in Lithuania,'' with the word
``Communism'' painted red to simulate dripping blood.
   The Congress is to last most of the week and observers expect a
vote on the party's status to take place Wednesday or Thursday.
   Juozaitis said he thought Latvia, Estonia, Georgia and Armenia
soon might follow the lead of the Lithuanian party in separating
from the national organization, strengthening Lithuania's hand in
dealing with Gorbachev.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Cutting Rates Slightly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's dominant long-distance telephone
company, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., announced Tuesday
that it will cut basic, daytime interstate rates an average of 1.3
percent Jan. 1. Evening rates will drop an average of 2.0 percent.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the reductions were necessary
under changes earlier this year in the Federal Communications
Commission's regulation of long-distance charges.
   The FCC now imposes caps on AT&amp;T's long-distance rates based on
the company's long-distance expenses, as opposed to a preset rate
of return.
   AT&amp;T said the lowered rates reflect reduced expenses, mainly
from reduced fees that AT&amp;T will pay in 1990 to local telephone
companies for access to local exchanges.
   John Hauser, a spokesman for AT&amp;T's principal competitor, MCI
Communications Corp., said MCI would also pass on savings in local
telephone company access charges. ``We will remain competitive with
them,'' he said.
   Hauser's counterpart at US Sprint, Robin Pence, said, ``We are
reviewing the filing and we intend to remain competitive.''
   AT&amp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long-distance market,
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2
with more than 10 percent. US Sprint claims 7 to 8 percent.
   In filing notice with the FCC of its intent to lower rates, AT&amp;T
estimated that the reductions would save customers $300 million a
year on interstate and international long-distance services used
primarily by residential and small business customers.
   A 10-minute AT&amp;T call during daytime hours on a weekday, to
anywhere in the United States, will cost $2.50 or less, an average
decrease of 1.3 percent.
   Linnen said a 10-minute daytime call from Washington to New
York, which now costs $2.30, would decline to $2.20, a drop of 4.3
percent. An evening call from Washington to San Francisco, Los
Angeles or Dallas, which now costs $1.67 for 10 minutes, would drop
5.3 percent to $1.58. Many of the reductions would be less for
other calls.
   The Monday-Friday ``day'' calling period is 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
local time. The ``evening'' period is 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday
through Friday.
   The ``night'' calling period, for which rates will not change,
is from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. Sunday through Friday. ``Weekend''
calling rates, identical to the night rates and also unaffected,
are in effect all day Saturday and until 5 p.m. Sunday.
   International calls from the 48 contiguous states to 25 of the
most frequently called countries will be slashed by $104 million.
The reductions will vary from country to country; the countries
will include Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, France,
Italy, Israel, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Korea.

   A police bomb squad today disarmed a parcel
bomb found at the Jacksonville, Fla., office of the NAACP, the
latest discovery in a rash of mail bombings in the South that have
claimed two lives, authorities said.
   ``It was designed to kill the individual that opened this
package or anyone else standing in the area,'' said Jacksonville
Sheriff Jim McMillan.
   The building was evacuated and the bomb, which arrived in the
mail Monday but was left unopened, was disarmed by disconnecting
the battery from the explosive, officials said.
   ``It had a great similarity in the packaging to the other
bombs,'' said Willi Ellison of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms. ``It was addressed to no one specifically, but to the
legal staff of the NAACP.''
   The bomb was to be taken to an FBI laboratory in Washington and
compared with the other devices, he said.
   FBI Director William Sessions said in Washington that
investigators were looking into race as a possible motive, noting
that the incidents involved ``federal judges who have heard cases
involving racial matters,'' the NAACP and a black civil rights
activist.
   Under questioning, Sessions told a Justice Department news
conference that more than one person might be involved in the
bombings, which have killed a federal judge and a civil rights
lawyer.
   The parcel bomb that killed the lawyer in Savannah had been
packed with nails, suggesting another link to the bomb that killed
the judge and another bomb, authorities said.
   In Alabama, police X-rayed a package left on the doorstep of a
Birmingham city councilman who was friends with the slain judge,
but concluded it was probably an innocent mailing. ``This is one of
many screening processes we'll probably be going through because of
the situation,'' said FBI agent Allen Whitaker.
   The FBI, meanwhile, warned judges, lawyers and NAACP activists
to beware of strange packages, saying white supremacists might be
behind the attacks.
   Robert Robinson, a 42-year-old black lawyer and city alderman,
was fatally injured in his law office Monday night, hours after
police removed an explosive device delivered to the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and two days after a mail bomb
killed 11th Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance.
   ``There's a strong similarity in the three explosive devices,
and it appears there is a relationship,'' FBI agent Tom Moore said
in Birmingham, Ala.
   Officials said the bomb that killed Vance on Saturday hurled
nails when it exploded. The Atlanta Constitution today quoted
unidentified authorities as saying the Atlanta bomb contained nails
as well, and Savannah Mayor John Rousakis said today: ``We believed
nails were part of this bomb also, and that has been confirmed.''
   Robinson represented the NAACP in a long-running desegregation
lawsuit involving Savannah schools, and the 11th Circuit, which
handles appeals for Georgia, Alabama and Florida, had recently
ruled in that case.
   Federal marshals said the nine judges in the 11th Circuit were
being given round-the-clock protection.
   In Washington, a government source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the bomb that killed Vance bore the return address
of a second judge who regularly sent Vance packages. The second
judge, Lewis F. Morgan, also of the 11th Circuit, is not a suspect
in the case. But the discovery means the killer knew a great deal
about Vance's personal habits and friendships, the source added.
   FBI agent Bob DeLoach said Monday that authorities were
following several leads but that it was possible white supremacists
sent the bomb that killed Robinson.
   ``I've been here three years and can't recall white
supremacists, but who knows what goes on in people's minds and why
they'd start now?'' DeLoach asked. ``We're definitely looking into
that, but everything else, too.''
   Former Alabama Ku Klux Klan leader Don Black, who now lives in
South Florida, said there are disgruntled members of the white
supremacist movement who believe the legal system works against the
white majority.
   ``They believe the only solution is direct attacks, illegal
acts, on the system,'' Black said. ``When that first bombing
happened Saturday, it occurred to me it might not be Colombian drug
smugglers.''
   DeLoach and FBI agent William Henshaw said the FBI was warning
lawyers, judges and activists with the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People to look over their mail carefully.
   Henshaw said the NAACP Southeast regional headquarters in
Atlanta also had been warned because the bombs appeared to be
related to a Aug. 22, 1989 tear-gas mail bomb that exploded at the
Atlanta office, injuring eight people. That case is still being
investigated.
   Earl Shinhoster, the NAACP regional director, said he had talked
with the FBI and ``needless to say, it was a wide-ranging
discussion.''
   Shinhoster also said he hadn't ruled out the possibility that
white supremacists were responsible for the bombings ``especially
now, since various groups ... are much more zealous in their
particular ideological pursuits.''
   Morris Dees, head of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the
FBI had warned him to take precautions.
   ``The FBI contacted me as a routine matter (because) they
suspect it was a possibility that white supremacists were involved
in the bombings,'' he said. ``And, as a precautionary measure
because of my past involvement, wanted to warn me.''
   On Sunday, authorities warned the nation's 1,500 federal judges
to be careful with their mail.
   ``We have pretty good security here,'' said U.S. Circuit Judge
William W. Wilkins of Greenville, S.C. ``But I've of course asked
my family not to open any packages mailed to the home unless I've
had a chance to take a look at them.''
   ``It's a tough business,'' said Judge Daniel A. Manion of South
Bend, Ind. Manion sits on a three-judge panel of the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   Robinson represented the NAACP in its challenge to a plan to
settle a 25-year-old desegregation lawsuit against the Savannah
School system, said State Rep. Jim Pannell of Savannah, who
attended the University of Georgia Law school with Robinson.
   The 11th Circuit in September upheld the plan that relied
heavily on magnet schools to draw more whites into predominantly
black schools and voluntary ``majority to minority'' transfers.
   The NAACP and U.S. Department of Justice had objected to the
plan, which was put into place voluntarily by the school system
last fall.
   Vance, 58, was not on the three-judge panel that ruled in the
case but did serve on a panel that had cleared the way for
prosecution of a case against the Ku Klux Klan.
   The panel, in a June 1985 decision, had overturned a lower court
ruling that had thrown out evidence critical to the prosecution of
10 Klansmen in a bloody May 1979 confrontation with black civil
rights marchers in Decatur, Ala., that wounded four people.
   Authorities said the Atlanta bomb was in a mailed package
addressed to the 11th Circuit courthouse _ but not to a specific
individual, unlike the bomb that killed Vance. Employees were
evacuated from the five-story downtown building Monday morning.
Police safely disarmed the bomb.

   Leaders of East and West were united
Tuesday in denouncing Romania's Stalinist regime for the bloody
repression of protesters.
   Some reports said hundreds of people were killed when Romanian
security forces opened fire over the weekend on demonstrators
protesting the harsh rule of President Nicolae Ceausescu, the last
autocrat in the Soviet bloc.
   Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union said
that, if the reports of bloodshed were true, ``I can only express
my very profound regret. We are categorically opposed to the use of
force.''
   Shevardnadze was at a meeting of about 200 members of the
European Parliament in Brussels.
   There was no comment in Beijing, where the Chinese government
crushed a peaceful pro-democracy movement with tanks on June 4-5.
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said:
``The repressive measures undertaken by the Romanian government are
totally unjustified and stand in stark contrast to the positive
changes taking place elsewhere in Eastern Europe.''
   A minister in the British Foreign Office, William Waldegrave,
warned Romanian officials of what may lie ahead.
   ``Those in the security services, those working for the state,
should recognize that a day of reckoning will come for them as it
has come for the East Germans and others,'' he said. ``The right
thing for them to do ... is to represent the true will of the
Romanian people and put an end to this regime.''
   Stan Soare, the Romanian ambassador, was summoned to receive a
protest expressed in ``the strongest possible terms'' a British
government spokesman said, and responded by ``resorting to the
tired old formula of alleging interference in Romania's internal
affairs.''
   In its first protest to another member of the Soviet bloc,
Bulgaria expressed ``serious concern'' to the Romanian Embassy in
Sofia over the closing of the frontier.
   Romania closed its borders Monday allowing passage only to
diplomats and other officials.
   Foreign ministers of the 12 European Community nations denounced
the violence and several governments lodged official protests with
Romanian diplomats.
   A statement by the 12 foreign ministers issued in Brussels said
Ceausescu's regime was ``turning its back on all the commitments
concerning human rights to which it has subscribed'' in the 1975
Helsinki agreements on human rights.
   Ceausescu ``is capable only of repressing by force the
legitimate aspirations of the Romanian people to freedom,'' they
said.
   Thousands of exiled Romanians were said to be planning a rally
Thursday in London.
   In Prague, the Czechoslovak Foreign Ministry said: ``We
resolutely protest the use of army and police against
demonstrators.''
   Vaclav Havel, the opposition leader and presidential candidate,
said to reporters: ``When and if we have greater influence on
Czechoslovakia's foreign policy ... we'll be able to do more for
Romanians and Hungarians in Romania who are being killed by this
terrible, Dracula-like person.''
   A statement from Civic Forum, Havel's opposition group, said
Czechoslovkia was ``learning with horror of the brutal
intervention'' and was ``deeply shaken.''
   Poland's parliament passed a resolution saying Romanian
``authorities used force with exceptional brutality. Even children
were the targets of shooting.''
   Austria's Foreign Ministry said its protest of ``catastrophic
human rights practice in Romania'' was rejected by the Romanian
charge d'affaires, Marian Radu, who also was unwilling ``to give
expedient information verbally on the situation in Romania.''
   In neighboring Hungary, feelings ran high because up to 1.7
million ethnic Hungarians live in Transylvania, the area of western
Romania where the violence occurred.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth said ``anachronistic regimes opposed to
progress cannot remain in place'' if Europe is to be united.
   Nepszabadsag, the official party of the Socialist _ formerly
Communist _ Party, said: ``History has already witnessed the reign
of regimes, not so long ago, that showed off their strength with
tanks before being overthrown by the rage of the people.''

   The Ukrainian church officials, based in Rome, said the orthodox
parishes that shifted to Catholicism are near Lvov, in the Western
Ukraine. The officials said figures for the rest of the Ukraine are
not yet available.
   According to Western estimates, there are 4 to 6 million
Catholics in the Ukraine. Soviet leader Josef Stalin suppressed
their church in 1946, forcing them to convert to Russian Orthodox
or to practice their religion clandestinely.
   However, on Dec. 1, Ukrainian authorities announced they would
allow Catholic congregations to register like other groups.
Rome-based Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky called it a ``first step''
toward complete legalization.
   The Russian Orthodox have opposed legalization of the Ukrainian
Catholic Church, as they stand to lose hundreds of churches and
thousands of followers they gained after the 1946 repression.
   The decision to allow Catholic congregations to register was
announced as Pope John Paul II held talks with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Vatican, where the pope appealed to
Gorbachev to assure full religious freedom for Catholics in the
Soviet Union.

   Cuts in U.S. military spending in response to
a waning Soviet threat will create economic problems in
defense-oriented regions, but a group of economists said Tuesday
that federal subsidies aren't the answer.
   ``Major federal spending to support particular regions is
counterproductive to the economy,'' Donald H. Straszheim, chief
economist at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, told Congress' Joint
Economic Committee.
   ``Regional interests overwhelming the national interest is part
of the problem, not part of the solution,'' he said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is considering cuts in the armed
forces and cancellation or lengthening weapons programs as part of
an effort to reduce the defense budget.
   Last month, Cheney directed the services to come up with between
$140 billion and $180 billion in cuts from the fiscal 1992 to 1994
military budgets.
   Straszheim and two other economists testifying before the
committee, which is examining the economic adjustment after the
Cold War, said cuts in military spending will affect defense
contractors nationwide. However, they said financial assistance
from Washington and a national job retraining program should not be
options.
   Pressed by Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y., Straszheim said that
although the approach was a ``cold, hard position of doing
nothing,'' he would not suggest a wide-ranging program to help
areas that might be financially strapped.
   ``A few years ago, Texas was devastated when oil prices went up
and then down. ... That's life,'' Straszheim said.
   Scheuer, whose district includes parts of New York City and Long
Island, wondered about Grumman Corp., the Long Island manufacturer
of the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighter.
   Cheney, in the fiscal 1990 defense budget, proposed canceling
the program. Congress agreed to continue it for one more year but
forced Grumman to sign an agreement that included a termination
clause.
   ``Grumman sits over that Long Island economy like a 600-pound
canary,'' Scheuer said. ``What do we do about the 10,000 employees
at risk? What do we do about the Long Island economy? Do we have a
retraining program?''
   Other hard hit areas that rely heavily on defense business
include San Antonio, San Diego and the tidewater region of Virginia.
   Charles L. Schultze, director of the economic studies program at
the Brookings Institution, said the adjustment from cuts in defense
would be no different from changes that occur every year across the
nation in other businesses.
   ``This isn't a big deal,'' Schultze said.

<HEAD>House Members Call For Sharing Burden Of Asian Defense</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four House members called on the Bush
administration Tuesday to encourage U.S. allies in Asia to share
more of the defense burden and suggested channeling the savings to
developing nations in the area.
   ``As the Koreans and Japanese pick up more of the U.S. costs,
some of this money can be put to work nurturing our alliances
elsewhere,'' said Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas. ``Access and
influence are the name of the game in the Pacific and we can use
all of the friends we can find.''
   He said military assistance to Thailand, which hosted more than
100 U.S. Navy ships last year, has bottomed out.
   Leath, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, and three
other colleagues on the panel _ Reps. David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y.,
Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, and H. Martin Lancaster, D-N.C. _
traveled to the Pacific region Dec. 5-16 to assess national
security interests.
   In a report the lawmakers noted that the cost of maintaining
U.S. forces in Asia has increased sharply. South Korea has been the
source of a major increase due to a pay hike for the Korean work
force.
   ``Sometimes I wonder if we are more interested in providing for
their social security or our national security,'' Leath said.
``Money's tight and getting tighter, and we no longer can affort to
be the benevolent Uncle Sam.''
   Martin, the ranking Republican on the Armed Services
subcommittee on military installations and facilities, said Japan
has ``accelerated their contributions to the U.S. presence both in
terms of salaries for Japanese employees and facilities.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday placed strict limits
on the prosecution's use of Oliver L. North as a witness in the
Iran-Contra trial of former National Security Adviser John
Poindexter.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said prosecutors ``may
only elicit evidence'' from North based on statements he made
before July 15, 1987, the day Poindexter began testifying on
Capitol Hill before a national television audience.
   The restriction means the government is unable to use most of
the testimony North gave at his own trial, last April, during which
he frequently mentioned Poindexter, his former White House boss.
   However, prosecutors will be allowed to elicit evidence from
North based on his testimony to Congress, which he gave prior to
Poindexter's testimony, said the judge. The government also will be
permitted to delve into subjects to which Poindexter did not
testify.
   Poindexter's trial is scheduled to begin Jan. 22 on charges of
conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements.
   At a pre-trial hearing last week, North repeatedly said he was
unable to separate in his mind his own experiences in the
Iran-Contra affair from what he learned by watching and reading
Poindexter's testimony.
   The judge was openly skeptical of North's contention, but said
he would accept the assertion in order to protect Poindexter's
rights.
   ``The court takes North's alleged inability to differentiate
with a grain of salt,'' said Greene. ``It seems unlikely that a
witness who was a major and active participant in the events
themselves would be unable to distinguish between the version of
events described in another's testimony.''
   The court's obligations, however, require it to ``err on the
side of protecting Poindexter's constitutional right not to be
convicted with the use of his own testimony,'' said the judge.
   Greene denied Poindexter's motion to dismiss the indictment on
grounds that it had been tainted by his congressional testimony,
which he gave under a guarantee that it would not be used against
him in court.
   ``The court is confident that the government's trial witnesses
will testify from knowledge that is independent of the information
elicited from Poindexter at the congressional hearings,'' said the
judge.
   Greene also allowed Iran-Contra prosecutors Dan Webb and Howard
Pearl to remain in the case, rejecting assertions by Poindexter
that they had been tainted by exposure to his congressional
testimony. Greene said neither prosecutor has any recollection of
the contents of Poindexter's testimony and therefore could make no
use of it.
   A 1972 Supreme Court ruling says the prosecution must derive all
its evidence in a case from sources wholly independent of testimony
a defendant gave under a grant of immunity.
   Greene's ruling means North will be limited in his testimony
about a presidential finding which Poindexter tore up on Nov. 21,
1986. The December 1985 finding retroactively legalized a November
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
   North testified at his trial that he watched Poindexter tear up
the finding _ which relates to four of the five criminal charges
against the ex-national security adviser. But North testified last
week that he was certain it was the finding that was destroyed only
because Poindexter admitted it in his immunized testimony on
national TV.
   ``I think that North has snaked his way around that'' and won't
have to testify at the trial about Poindexter tearing up the
finding, said John Nields, former chief counsel to the House
majority staff in the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.
   Nields said that since North did not tell the congressional
committees that he saw Poindexter destroy the finding, he ``won't
be able to testify to it at the trial'' and ``I don't think the
government has any other proof of it.''
   The prosecution says the finding which Poindexter destroyed is
``the most critical document in proving the falsity'' of another
document, a chronology which is an essential part of the
government's case against Poindexter.
   Poindexter is accused of telling Congress the same day he
destroyed the finding that no one in the U.S. government knew until
1986 that the November 1985 shipment to Iran contained Hawk
missiles.

<HEAD>Dems Target 18 State Legislatures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Democratic Party announced plans Tuesday
to target statehouse elections in 18 states next year in the hope
of controlling state legislatures when congressional districts are
redrawn for the 1990s.
   The Democrats hope to raise $3 million to help candidates for
the legislatures in those states next year, said Tim Dickson, who
heads the party's Project 500 program.
   The program's aim is to expand Democratic control of state
legislatures before they begin congressional and state legislative
reapportionment in 1992.
   Democrats are particularly concerned with states likely to gain
or lose congressional districts as a result of population shifts
that will come to light in the 1990 census. They are also focusing
on states where the majority's grip in the state legislature is
tenuous.
   ``We believe fair lines will be drawn, but we prefer to be the
ones drawing them,'' Dickson told a news conference. ``Since 1980,
individual elections have been battles, but control of
redistricting is the war.''
   The targeted states are Arizona, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia,
Washington and Wisconsin.
   Democrats now control 36 state Houses and 32 state Senates,
while Republicans control 12 Houses and 17 Senates. They share
power in Indiana's House; Nebraska has a nonpartisan bicameral
legislature.
   Dickson said that the $3 million would be more than three times
what the national party spent toward state legislative races in
1988, and that his group has raised $650,000 toward the goal.
   The party will give money to Democratic legislative campaign
organizations in each of the states, which will decide how to
divide it among individual candidates. Some of the money may go to
gubernatorial candidates, although the party has another fund for
those campaigns.
   Of the targeted states, five are exected to gain congressional
seats because of population shifts: one or two seats in Arizona;
five or six seats in California; three or four seats in Florida and
Texas, and one seat in Virginia.
   Six other states are expected to lose seats due to
reapportionment, with New York projected to lose three seats and
Ohio and Pennsylvania each expected to lose two and possibly three.
Illinois is projected to lose two seats, according to the
Democrats; Iowa, one seat, and Wisconsin, perhaps one.
   The Republican National Committee also has a program to target
state legislative races and governors' races. Leslie Goodman, a
spokeswoman for the Republicans, said the party would not reveal
its spending plans or list its targeted states.
   ``It makes no sense to lay out a political game plan,'' she said.
   But, Goodman said, the Republicans will be focusing on states
where redistricting will mean a gain or loss of congressional
seats, and what she said were 14 states where Republicans are
within striking distance of winning control of at least one
legislative chamber now held by the Democrats.
   ``Ultimately we have to do better in redistricting than we did
in '81,'' she said. ``We consistently get gerrymandered out of our
fair share. ... We're never going to have a shot if we don't get
the lines drawn fairly and properly.''

<HEAD>US Confirms Israel Buying Iranian Oil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department said on Tuesday that
Israel made a major oil deal with Iran as part of a reported effort
to win the release of three Israeli soldiers being held in Lebanon.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Israel informed
the United States of the oil deal a month ago. She declined to say
whether the United States approved of the deal.
   ``Foreign countries do not seek U.S. approval for oil purchases
from a third country,'' she added.
   The United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran and is
worried about the possibility of Iranian-backed terrorist incidents
against American targets in Europe or Africa during the holiday
season.
   Iran is one of six countries which, according to the State
Department, supports international terrorism.
   NBC News disclosed the oil transaction Monday night, saying that
Israel paid Iran $36 million and that one purpose was to encourage
Iran to use its influence to help free three Israeli soldiers being
held in Lebanon.
   The United States is backing the deal in hopes that it could
lead to the release of American hostages held in Lebanon, NBC said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States does not make deals for the
release of U.S. hostages, but she refused to offer an opinion as to
whether there is any objection to Israel carrying out negotiations
on behalf of the hostages.
   In addition to winning the radical Moslem country's help in
seeking the release of Israelis, the oil purchases and a potential
spare parts deal are intended to bolster Iran's position against a
common enemy, Iraq, NBC said.
   Iran's Islamic fundamentalist leaders are generally hostile to
Israel but the country's struggling economy is sorely in need of
foreign currency.
   Spokesmen for Israel's Energy, Foreign and Defense ministries on
Tuesday refused to comment on the report. The Defense Ministry also
refused to allow reporters to talk to Uri Lubrani, mentioned in the
NBC report as the man who dealt with the Iranians in Switzerland.
   Lubrani is responsible for Israel's Lebanon policy and served as
ambassador to Iran before the revolution that swept Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini to power.
   Joseph Alpher of the Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for
Strategic Studies, executive editor of the center's annual ``Middle
East Military Balance'', said Israel had other considerations that
could justify ties with Iran, apart from seeking the release of its
prisoners.
   ``Iraq is getting stronger every day by acquiring chemical and
non-conventional arms that threaten us,'' Alpher said on Israel
Television. ``There is a reason to see to it that Iran can continue
confronting and diversing the Iraqi forces.''
   ``Beyond that, Iran has oil, Iran has Jews and all these are
good reasons for renewal of connections with Iran, without any
relation to the governing regime,'' he said.

   Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, visiting
Iran while his security forces suppress protesters at home, laid a
wreath Tuesday at the tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and spoke
of peace in the Persian Gulf.
   The Romanian president said Iraqis should withdraw from Iranian
territory so the rival neighbors can sign a peace treaty.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Ceausescu as
saying an Iraqi withdrawal ``is the starting point for
implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 598, and we are
trying our best in the Security Council to enforce this
resolution.''
   While Ceausescu was in Tehran, reports from Romania indicated
security forces may have killed hundreds of people during weekend
demonstrations against Ceausescu, who runs the last Stalinist
regime in the Soviet bloc.
   Romania has virtually sealed its borders and official media have
not reported the unrest.
   A U.N.-mediated truce ended an 8-year-old war between Iran and
Iraq in August 1988, but peace talks have not resolved their
differences.
   Iran insists the Iraqis withdraw from territory occupied in the
last weeks of the war. Iraq wants a border that gives it full
control of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, its sole outlet to the
Persian Gulf.
   Tehran radio said Ceausescu met separately with Vice President
Roghani Zanjani and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on Tuesday,
the second day of a three-day official visit.
   He and Zanjani discussed an agreement under which Iran will
export about 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas and 1 million
barrels of oil a year to Romania.
   Romania is Iran's second-largest trading partner in Eastern
Europe. The estimated volume this year is about $1.8 billion.
   According to the radio, Ceausescu expressed readiness to
cooperate with Iran in ``numerous'' fields, stressing cooperation
in mining.
   Earlier Tuesday, Ceausescu laid a wreath at Khomeini's tomb in
the Beheshte Zahra cemetery outside Tehran. The revolutionary
patriarch died June 3.
   In a reference to Ceausescu's resistance to pro-democracy
reforms sweeping the Soviet bloc, Iran's official news agency
praised Romania on Monday as ``the sole east European country
rigidly adhering to its past government.''
   Ceausescu became Communist Party chief March 22, 1965, and now
is the longest-serving leader in Eastern Europe.

   People who track hate groups said Tuesday that
white supremacists are logical suspects in the mail-bomb killings
of a federal judge in Alabama and a lawyer in Georgia.
   Racist mentalities fit the bill in both motive and mode: they
are angry over recent defeats in court cases, and they have a
historical bent for bombings, according to two hate group watchers.
   ``There's no reason to disbelieve they would be connected to
these incidents. They have planned to kill federal judges before,
and there have been similar incidents with bombs,'' said Danny
Levitan, executive director of the Center for Democratic Renewal in
Atlanta.
   On Saturday, a mail bomb killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance, who wrested control of the Alabama
Democratic Party from white supremacists during the 1960s, at his
home in a Birmingham, Ala., suburb. On Monday, another mail bomb
killed Savannah, Ga., Alderman Robert Robinson, an attorney who was
working on a long-running school desegregation case.
   A fourth bomb was found Tuesday at the Jacksonville, Fla.,
office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People. The office was evacuated and the bomb, which arrived in the
mail Monday but was left unopened, was disarmed, officials said.
   FBI Director William Sessions told a Washington news conference
Tuesday that the pattern didn't fit white supremacist groups, but
said they weren't being ruled out. The FBI has warned civil rights
activists as well as lawyers and judges to beware of strange
packages because of the possibility white supremacists mailed the
Savannah bomb.
   The bombs that killed Vance and Robinson were pipe bombs
containing nails, authorities said.
   Racist groups typically use that sort of bomb, said Leonard
Zeskind, research director for the Center for Democratic Renewal.
   ``The Klan and Nazi groups are more likely to use pipe or powder
bombs,'' he said. ``Plastic (explosives) is drug stuff.''
   Recent court losses have hurt racist groups in the pocketbook
and in efforts to recruit more members, giving them a potential
motive for retaliation, said Pat Carter of Klanwatch.
   ``Some of these groups are perturbed that they are losing their
assets,'' she said. ``It has made their membership very bitter.''
   In 1987, a U.S. District Court jury awarded $7 million to the
mother of a Mobile, Ala., teen-ager murdered in 1981 by two Ku Klux
Klansmen. Last year, a U.S. District Court jury in Atlanta awarded
$950,400 in damages to two civil rights leaders because of violence
surrounding the first of two civil rights marches in Forsyth
County, Ga., in 1987.
   White supremacist groups have enjoyed renewed popularity in the
South over the past decade. Incidents of racial hatred surged from
eight in 1978 to 276 in 1986, the last year for which figures were
available, according to statistics compiled by the U.S. Justice
Department's Community Relations Service.
   The Center for Democratic Renewal, formerly the Anti-Klan
Network, found 3,000 racial incidents reported between 1980 and
1986, including about 500 in 1986 alone, Levitan said.
   ``We view the level of hate crimes as having reached epidemic
proportions,'' he said. ``Skinheads and youth are at the cutting
edge.''
   Skinheads favor extremely short haircuts. Many, but not all,
also embrace white supremacist ideology.
   Klanwatch, a unit of the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., has identified at least 11 active hate groups in
Georgia and Alabama, including two Skinhead groups in Alabama and
one in Georgia.

   Christer Pettersson, a 42-year-old
drifter acquitted of the 1986 murder of Prime Minister Olof Palme,
wants $320,000 in compensation for the 10 months he was jailed for
questioning and trial, news reports said Tuesday.
   Pettersson, who has a long history of drug abuse and crime, was
convicted in July but won an appeal on the grounds of insufficient
evidence.
   He previously said he was not interested in the money.
   ``This is a lot of money, but it is also a very unusual case,''
the national TT news agency quoted Pettersson's lawyer, Arne
Liljeros, as saying. ``Christer Pettersson was detained for a long
period, and he has had to suffer much publicity. He is marked for
the rest of his life.''
   After his release, Pettersson rejected a police offer to
relocate him and give him a new identity.
   Palme, prime minister for 11 years, was shot on a Stockholm
street while walking home from a movie with his wife, Lisbeth.
   Authorities have said Pettersson remains a suspect. He could be
tried again under Swedish law, but only on the basis of compelling
new evidence.

   Shooting and fires were reported Tuesday
in western Romania, where witnesses say security forces may have
killed hundreds of people who protested the harsh Communist regime
of President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Greek students who crossed into Yugoslavia from the Romanian
city of Timisoara, site of the greatest unrest over the weekend,
said shots were fired indiscriminately, ``killing dozens.''
   They said many children were killed or wounded ``because people
used them as shields,'' assuming security forces would hold their
fire.
   A Romanian doctor who arrived in Austria spoke of protesters
stoning armored vehicles. He said one vehicle drove into the crowd,
crushing a woman, and rows of people were mowed down by gunfire.
   Ceausescu was on the second day of a three-day official visit to
Iran. He has run Romania for 24 years, and the tide of reform
sweeping out the old guard elsewhere has made him the
longest-serving Communist ruler.
   Late Tuesday, the Yugoslav state news agency Tanjug in what it
called an eyewitness account said there were unconfirmed reports of
up to 2,000 dead. Most previous accounts from a variety of sources
leaving Romania estimated 300 to 400 dead.
   ``Some travelers say that in Timisoara, police are brutally
fighting demonstrators, mostly young people. Unconfirmed reports
speak of large numbers of victims, as many as 2,000 people _ men,
women and children,'' Tanjug said without identifying its sources.
   It added, ``Witnesses claim that police are taking the arrested
demonstrators to the central Timisoara Square, where they beat them
and stab them with bayonets, before shoving them into lorries
(trucks) and driving them away no one knows where.''
   The news agency said the clashes in Timisoara, a Translyvanian
city, were continuing and that late Tuesday the government in
Belgrade called on Romania ``to immediately put an end to violence
and prevent further bloodshed.''
   The Roman Catholic news agency Kathpress in Vienna said a doctor
told them by telephone from Timisoara, 30 miles from the Yugoslav
and Hungarian borders, that hundreds were wounded and deaths could
surpass 400.
   None of the accounts could be confirmed because journalists and
nearly all other foreigners were barred in an effort to stop word
of the unrest from spreading. Repeated attempts to telephone
Bucharest from Vienna and Budapest on Tuesday were unsuccessful.
   Tanjug reported from Bucharest, capital of Romania, that
students there had declared solidarity with the protesters in
Timisoara and, in response, police guards were posted in
dormitories.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said ``an unusual tension is
noticeable'' in Bucharest. ``The guarding of government agencies,
plants and factories has been strengthened. ... On the streets,
soldiers armed with automatic weapons and members of the Patriotic
People's Front (militia) are patrolling. ... Buses are parked with
soliders and policemen.''
   In Washington, the Bush administration condemned the ``brutal
use of police force'' and said the United States was consulting
with allies about the possibility of sending independent observers
to Romania.
   Accounts trickling out suggested Ceausescu, the last Stalinist
ruler in the Soviet bloc, sanctioned unprecedented force to crush
the protest.
   Tass said Soviet authorities had been told no Soviet tourists
could be accepted ``due to adverse weather conditions, the absence
of snow needed for winter tourism and a great demand'' for hotel
space from students on holidays.
   Romanians have been comparatively quiet for years, largely out
of fear, but have been made restive by austerity policies that
subjected the nation of 23 million to widespread rationing and
other hardships.
   Timisoara, a city of 350,000 people, is a major point of contact
with other countries. Foreign traders travel there regularly to
sell goods that are scarce in Romania.
   Official Romanian media made no mention of disturbances, but the
Communist Party daily Scinteia said in a commentary the ``spirit as
well as the letter of the law must be applied in every field and
every circumstance.''
   A Western resident of Timisoara traveled to Yugoslavia on
Tuesday and said the violence was ``horrifying.''
   He reported seeing several corpses in the streets and said parts
of the downtown area, including local Communist Party headquarters,
were badly damaged.
   Hungarian radio quoted a Hungarian who said several of his
relatives were physicians working in Timisoara hospitals. He said
he estimated from their telephone reports that 300 to 400 people
were killed in the city, and 250 bodies were taken to one hospital
alone.
   About 20 percent of the dead and wounded were ethnic Hungarians,
he said.
   That would substantiate other accounts that the protest began
with a few hundred ethnic Hungarians defending a local pastor
Friday and grew into a demonstration against Ceausescu on Sunday.
It was the largest anti-government protest since a march by 10,000
workers in Brasov in November 1987.
   A Romanian doctor arrived at Graz from Timisoara on Monday
evening told the Austria Press Agency thousands of people chanting
``Down with Ceausescu!'' ``We are hungry!'' and ``We want
freedom!'' movedtoward the center of the city at about 2 p.m.
Sunday, stoning armored vehicles.
   He said one armored vehicle ``drove into the crowd like crazy. .
.. I saw a woman of about 40 driven over and crushed,'' but the
protesters did not disperse.
   Security forces opened fire without warning about 7 p.m., and
``the first three rows just collapsed, dead or wounded,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   ``There was panic, some people wanted to go back. The crowd was
pushing forward. People were stopping private cars and loading dead
or wounded into the trunks.''
   Magyar Hirlap, a Hungarian daily, said violence had spread to
Arad and Brasov, two other cities in Transylvania, but gave no
specifics.
   It quoted Col. Janos Pal of the Hungarian border police as
saying crowds in Curtici, between Arad and Timisoara, broke into
the local Communist Party headquarters Sunday and burned documents.
   Romania and Hungary have a long-standing dispute about alleged
harassment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania, most of
whom live in Transylvania. That region, along with Moldavia in the
north, has been the center of what little protest has occurred.
   Frank Zemberi, a Yugoslav trucker bound from Cluj, Romania, to
London, said he passed through Timisoara early Tuesday and saw two
large fires raging in distant parts of town.
   ``Countless'' tanks were parked on the outskirts of Timisoara,
he said, but the city appeared calm. He reported seeing five
armored vehicles parked in the downtown area and police vans
cruising the streets.
   Hungarian radio said a caller from Timisoara reported gunfire in
the streets Tuesday, then the telephone went dead.
   Radio Kossuth, which said it got a call through briefly to
Timisoara on Tuesday morning, quoted a resident it did not name as
saying things were calm during the day, ``but at night it's like
during the war.''
   ``All main intersections have roadblocks. Everybody is ...
checked and people are not allowed to leave town except in extreme
cases,'' the radio quoted the resident as saying.

   Jack Scherbak said he always figured if you
built a better roach killer, the world would beat a path to your
door.
   He claims he has. They haven't.
   A self-proclaimed jack-of-all-trades, he admits to only a slight
frustration in his latest attempt to crack the corporate
marketplace with a new idea.
   ``Some people have money and no ideas. Other people have ideas,
and no money,'' he said in an interview. ``I'm in the latter
category.''
   Scherbak, 49, who also works as a carpenter and plays classical
guitar at nightclubs and restaurants, majored in physics and math
for one year at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. But literature
finally won out over math.
   ``Science has always been restricted,'' he said last week. ``In
a sense, it's just like the guitar. You have to practice to be able
to express your emotion.''
   Inspired by beat poet Jack Kerouac, Scherbak left college and
hit the road. He joined the Army and was a medic in Texas, then
took art and sculpture classes in New York City.
   Several years ago he submitted a plan to the Nebraska Energy
Office to fill discarded aluminum cans with popped pocorn and build
insulating panels, walls, roofs, ``even a whole house,'' he said.
   ``They said it was a novel idea, but no loan company would give
a person a loan to build with something so unconventional,'' he
said.
   Earlier this year, Scherbak confronted a real and present
problem: roaches under the kitchen sink.
   Commercial roach traps didn't work, he said. Sprays were toxic
and he didn't want to endanger his family's health.
   So, he began mixing common household ingredients until he found
a nontoxic combination that worked. He won't say what's in it
because it's not patented yet.
   He put it in a spray can labeled ``ZEZ, the world's first
non-toxic roach spray.''
   He carries the can along with a plastic gallon jug full of live
roaches and a large metal kettle for demonstrations.
   After dumping four roaches into the kettle, he sprayed them with
ZEZ. As they died, he sprayed the product into his eyes and mouth.
   ``The roaches are dead but I'm OK,'' he said.
   He's not bashful in attempts to market the stuff.
   Last month, he wrote to the entertainment director of ``The
Tonight Show,'' saying he'd like to meet Nebraska native Johnny
Carson and demonstrate his product on the television show.
   ``There's still no word from Hollywood, but at least we don't
have roaches under our sink anymore,'' he said.

   Testimony ended Tuesday in Larry
Mahoney's trial on 27 murder charges and lawyers said the nation's
worst drunken-driving case might go to the jury Wednesday.
   Still to come were closing arguments and the judge's
instructions to the Carroll Circuit Court jury.
   Mahoney, 36, allegedly was drunk and driving on the wrong side
of Interstate 71 when his pickup rammed the front of a church bus
on May 14, 1988. Fire erupted from the bus' ruptured fuel tank and
24 children and three adults died. One adult and 39 children
escaped.
   In addition to the murder charges, Mahoney also is charged with
12 counts of first-degree assault, 42 of wanton endangerment and
one of drunken driving.
   The defense has claimed that Mahoney did not intentionally get
drunk and that the former school bus, a 1977 model manufactured by
Ford Motor Co. and Sheller-Globe Corp., was unsafe.
   Autopsies showed the fire, not the crash, killed the victims.
   Mahoney's lawyers pressed the bus-safety issue Tuesday,
rebutting a prosecution witness' testimony that school buses are
safer than other passenger vehicles.
   The prosecution testimony, from analyst William Boehly of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, was based on the
accident rate per miles traveled by school buses.
   But Byron Bloch, an auto-safety design consultant from Potomac,
Md., testified for the defense that buses were safe only ``from
(Boehly's) narrow statistical perspective.''
   ``It would be erroneous to conclude that his data rubber-stamp
the accident bus as a safe bus,'' Bloch said.
   The final witness was Donald Wright, a local musician whose
testimony was intended to discredit Kelly Osborne, the man who
defense lawyers say tricked Mahoney into drinking vodka the night
of the bus crash.
   Osborne testified Monday that he mixed a vodka and Sprite for
Mahoney, but only at Mahoney's request. Osborne denied he ever
spiked anyone's drink.
   Wright testified that Jake Lansdale, a 79-year-old fiddler with
whom he plays, was incapacitated for nearly three hours after
drinking from a cup Osborne handed him during a performance in
August. Lansdale usually drank nothing when they played,
occasionally drank a beer, but had never been seen drinking liquor,
Wright said.
   But Wright could not swear that Osborne put anything in
Lansdale's cup, and said he did not know what made Lansdale
collapse.
   Judge Charles Satterwhite said Lansdale had been subpoenaed to
testify, but was excused because of illness.
   Special prosecutor Paul Richwalsky wrapped up his case Monday
with rebuttal witnesses and declined to call further witnesses
Tuesday.
   Attorneys said jurors would have two alternatives to the 27
murder charges _ second-degree manslaughter, punishable by five to
10 years in prison, and reckless homicide, punishable by one to
five years. In each case, a fine of up to $10,000 can be imposed.

   You've heard of the stealth bomber and the
stealth fighter, undetectable airplanes. The Pentagon has now
created the stealth memo: It can't be detected either.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, queried Tuesday about the
results of his months-long attempts to obtain more information
about the stealth F-117A fighter for reporters, acknowledged that
several memos on the subject have been lost.
   ``Even in the Pentagon, amazingly as it seems, memos get lost
and deep sixed and vanish into thin air. Stealth memos, yes. This
is a stealth memo program that we're testing,'' Williams quipped
when asked about his efforts.
   ``In fact, a memorandum to the Secretary (of the Air Force) was
written on this issue, sent to the Air Force and it vanished. ...
The Air Force's own radar couldn't detect it,'' Williams joked.
   The F-117A is the Air Force's most secret operational aircraft.
Based at Tonopah Test Range Airfield in Nevada, the jets have been
carefully screened from public view.
   But in recent months, more and more have been observed in flight
and pictures of the black, delta-winged craft have appeared in
magazines and technical journals.
   The jet, which was first test flown in 1978, uses the so-called
``stealth'' technology to provide it with low radar reflectivity
like its newer, better-known cousin, the B-2 bomber.
   The spokesman said the memo first sent to Air Force Secretary
Donald Rice about providing the press with more information ``was
subsequently found and revived'' and sent to another office ``and
it vanished into thin air again.''
   Williams stated that he was certain the Air Force had not ``deep
sixed'' the memo, or allowed it to be lost, arguing that the
service wanted to make more information about the so-called
``black'' program known.
   ``Black'' programs are the most secret in the Pentagon, with
little information released about them.
   One Defense Department source, who spoke on condition he not be
identified by name, said Air Force officials would like to release
some information about the F-117A program to show that its was
well-run, in contrast to difficulties that arose over the costly
B-2 bomber, another classified plane that now is estimated to cost
$530 million apiece.
   The spokesman said the lost memo was ``recreated in my office''
and sent to Rice again, and that he has approved it.
   ``So, there will be some effort to share more information about
the program with you,'' Williams pledged.
   The spokesman contended that the troubles arose because of the
highly secret nature of the fighter program and officials wanted to
be ``as forthcoming as we can without jeoapardizing the very
classified nature of the program. ... We don't do this a lot. We
don't embark very much on a public affairs campaign about black
programs.
   ``So we're in kind of a new area here and we are trying to make
an effort.''

<HEAD>Soviet, Japanese Officials Leave Treaty Talks Empty-Handed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet and Japanese officials failed to reach an
accord to formally settle World War II in their latest round of
talks with progress stymied by a territorial dispute dating back to
1945, officials said Tuesday.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Igor Rogachev suggested that
Tokyo and Moscow exchange drafts of a peace treaty to formally
settle World War II. But Japanese officials showed little
enthusiasm, insisting progress must first be made toward resolving
the dispute over the Kuril Islands.
   The dispute over the group of small islands north of Hokkaido,
Japan's northernmost main island, has been the most difficult
obstacle to concluding the treaty.
   Japan has demanded that the islands, held by the Soviets since
the closing days of the war in 1945, be returned. It has said no
peace treaty can be worked out until the issue is resolved.
   The Soviets have called on Japan to renounce its claim and
recognize ``postwar realities.''
   ``The time has come to exchange drafts of the treaty, a treaty
that will be the conclusive settlement to World War II,'' Rogachev
said at a news conference after meeting with Japanese Foreign
Minister Taro Nakayama.
   ``Their overall position hasn't changed,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Taizo Watanabe said. He added that Tokyo saw the offer as
a Soviet attempt to ``prompt procedures in their direction.''
   Both sides agreed in December to form a working-level group to
discuss the treaty, and Rogachev led the Soviet delegation at the
group's fourth round of talks Monday.
   Rogachev acknowledged that the nearly seven hours of
negotiations Monday broke down because of the territorial issue.
   The veteran Soviet diplomat, in Tokyo on the final leg of a
five-nation tour of Asia, said Moscow is taking into consideration
recent statements by Japanese leaders indicating a desire for
improved relations.
   During a visit to Tokyo last month, Alexander Yakovlev, a
Politburo member and close adviser to Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev, hinted at a ``third route'' to a solution, raising hopes
here.
   Rogachev, however, offered no such route, saying only that
though the Soviet claim to the islands hasn't changed, relations
continue to improve ``bit by bit, and within a certain framework.''
   He said that along with defining Japan-Soviet borders, the
treaty should reflect an agreement to cooperate in the economic
development of the Soviet Far East and Pacific coast areas.
   Rogachev said the next round of talks will be held early next
year. Japanese officials hope to hold talks before Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze visits in March.
   Rogachev said he and Nakayama also discussed Gorbachev's
scheduled visit to Japan in 1991, a first for a Soviet president.

<HEAD>Legislators Endorse Forced Repatriation Of Vietnamese</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators on Tuesday endorsed Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's controversial policy of forcibly repatriating
Vietnamese from Hong Kong, and the government indicated it will
resume the deportations, which had been suspended.
   The 309-219 vote in the House of Commons followed an acrimonious
three-hour debate.
   Paddy Ashdown, leader of the centrist Social and Liberal
Democratic Party, said repatriating the boat people against their
will ``shames our government, shames the prime minister and
ultimately shames our nation.''
   The first deportations of 51 Vietnamese on Dec. 12 provoked an
international outcry. The U.S. Administration called it
``unacceptable.''
   The Conservative government suspended the repatriations to allow
for the parliamentary debate.
   ``It was a decision that gave pleasure to none and, I
acknowledge, has caused anxiety to many,'' Foreign Office Minister
Francis Maude told the Commons Tuesday night.
   But he said the burden of 57,000 boat people now lingering in
Hong Kong detention camps and the prospect of thousands more
arriving when the sailing season begins in the spring had become
``intolerable.''
   All but 13,000 of the boat people have been classified as
economic migrants, not political refugees fleeing persecution.
   ``For those of us who do have those responsibilities, they
cannot be dodged, they cannot be shirked and we won't shirk them,''
Maude declared, indicating the repatriations will resume. He gave
no date.
   ``Of course, the United States has been critical. There are
historical reasons for this. But ... they have had no realistic
alternative to propound,'' Maude added.
   The government, meanwhile, could face another storm of criticism
after an announcement due Wednesday on the number of Hong Kong
Chinese who will be given residence rights in Britain after China
takes over the colony in 1997.
   Leaks from government officials put the total at about 225,000
of the 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese who now hold British
passports without residence rights.
   The British move is intended to cover about 50,000 key
government employees, entrepreneurs, and their families needed to
maintain the British administration and the territory's capitalist
system.
   Dozens of British legislators have threatened to vote down new
legislation to alter current Hong Kong passports.
   The rebellion is led by right-wingers opposed to immigration
from Britain's largely African, Asian and Caribbean former colonies.
   The government argues that with the insurance policy of British
residence, such people will stay for now and not join the estimated
1,000 skilled residents leaving Hong Kong each week for Australia,
Canada or the United States.
   ``We most certainly have a duty to those Crown servants in Hong
Kong who have enabled us and will enable us to carry out British
administration right up to 1997,'' Mrs. Thatcher told a questioner
in the Commons.
   China has pledged to allow capitalism and a great degree of
autonomy in Hong Kong for 50 years.

<HEAD>Britain Deporting Iranians Who Say They Are Rushdie Suspects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain said Tuesday it would deport two Iranian
students. Their lawyer said they said were suspected of plotting to
kill Salman Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Two other Iranians arrested the same day were freed. One, a
40-year-old man who has four children and suffers from multiple
sclerosis, said he was accused in hours of police questioning of
being a terrorist.
   The four were arrested Friday at their homes in Manchester under
the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which gives police the right to
hold them for seven days without charges.
   The Home Office said in a statement Tuesday night that
engineering students Karen Abrinia, 32, and Mehrdad Kokabi, 33,
would be sent to Iran ``as soon as possible.'' It said they were
being deported ``for reasons of national security,'' but did not
elaborate.
   Another student, Hussein Gharibi, and Javad Mousavi, 40, the
disabled father of four, were freed. Gharibi's age was not
available.
   Attorney Zahir Aziz, who represents the four Iranians, said
Monday: ``The police have told me very little, but the men are
under the impression they have been arrested because they are
suspected of being a hit squad to kill Salman Rushdie.''
   The Indian-born British novelist was condemned to death Feb. 14
by the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who accused
him of blaspheming Islam in his novel. He has been in hiding since,
under police protection.
   Britain and Iran have taken tentative steps toward renewing
diplomatic relations, severed over the Rushdie affair, but the
latest arrests jeopardize that process.
   Mousavi said after his release Tuesday night that accused him of
masterminding a plot to kill Rushdie.
   ``I don't know how to make bombs,'' he said in the living room
of his Manchester home, his wheelchair nearby. ``They accused me of
plotting to kill Salman Rushdie, but I told them I was innocent.''
   ``I am against terrorism,'' Mousavi said. ``I am in favor of
Salman Rushdie being punished, but not by me. He should be punished
by Islamic law and Islamic courts.''
   He said police questioned him three hours a day for five days.
   ``A police lady was very nice,'' he sad, ``but then a
superintendent was very bad. He told me: `You are a terrorist.' I
said how could I be a terrorist? I am a disabled man. They said I
could be a mastermind telling the others how to make bombs.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Monday quoted
the newspaper Kayhan on Monday as saying the arrests followed
anti-Rushdie demonstrations by Moslems at more than 1,000 mosques
in Britain.
   Tehran radio said Parliament speaker Mahdi Karrubi read a letter
Tuesday from several members urging the Foreign Ministry to take
``appropriate'' steps to protect the four Iranians.
   It quoted the letter as saying the Iranians were arrested
because ``the glory and size of the demonstrations had angered
British authorities.''
   ``If England does not change its hostile stance against Islam
and does not apologize to Moslems, the wave of these demonstrations
in England will surely increase,'' the radio quoted Karrubi as
saying.
   Patrick Stephenson, registrar at the University of Manchester
Institute of Science and Technology, said Kokabi and Abrinia were
engineering students who had completed their course work for
doctorates and were writing dissertations. It was not known where
Gharibi studies.

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze on Tuesday symbolically ended 40 years of East-West
hostility and suspicion by paying a visit to NATO headquarters.
   He said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw
Pact should stay in place to help ensure stability at a time of
tumultuous change on the European continent.
   Shevardnadze later went before the European Parliament, the
legislative arm of the European Community, and strongly cautioned
against quick efforts to unite the two Germanys. Leaders of the
12-nation trading bloc recently gave their strong backing to
eventual reunification.
   The Soviet official noted East Germany was an ally in the Warsaw
Pact and said:
   ``It is necessary to proceed on the basis of the postwar
realities, namely, the existence of two sovereign German states.
... A retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in Europe.''
   Later, Shevardnadze flew to London, where he got a strong
endorsement from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for keeping NATO
and the Warsaw Pact in place.
   Neither Mrs. Thatcher and Shevardnadze would give details of
their 2-hour discussion. But Shevardnadze said that ``on a number
of very important world issues, both global issues and regional
issues, we have a very good measure of agreement.''
   Shevardnadze's unprecedented visit to NATO headquarters on the
outskirts of Brussels was a dramatic sign of the reduced military
tensions between Western nations and their potential adversaries in
the East bloc. NATO was formed in 1949 to guard against the
security threat posed by the Soviet Union.
   After meeting with NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner,
Shevardnadze joked that his visit had been likened to traveling to
a volcano's crater. But he said he found ``a very friendly
atmosphere. So this was not a terrible thing.''
   Shevardnadze, who also met the ambassadors of the 16 NATO
nations, stressed the need for continuing the two alliances.
   ``We do believe the Warsaw Treaty and NATO at this crucial stage
in European development ... are able to play a very important
stabilizing role,'' he told reporters.
   Woerner, a former German defense minister, said Shevardnadze
mentioned in their private talks ``the very essential role of the
Americans here in Europe.''
   The officials said they agreed an East-West accord on slashing
conventional, or non-nuclear, weapons in Europe could be wrapped up
next year. They said the United States and the Soviet Union also
should reach agreement in 1990 on a new treaty cutting long-range
nuclear weapons.
   Woerner said Shevardnadze suggested formal contacts be set up
between the two military alliances. But the NATO chief said he
reminded Shevardnadze that NATO, unlike the Warsaw Pact, was a
voluntary association of democratically elected governments.
   William H. Taft IV, the American ambassador to NATO, said the
Warsaw Pact ``needs to do some more changing before it's a proper
partner in dialogue with NATO.''
   No surprises were reported.
   ``It was an important event (but) the importance was really a
symbolic one rather than substantive,'' said Gordon Smith, Canada's
envoy to NATO.
   Added Taft, ``It was more of a get-acquainted session.''
   In his speech to the European Parliament, Shevardnadze welcomed
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's recent call for NATO
to adopt a more political role in an era of reduced tensions. He
said the Warsaw Pact also must change with ``political aspects
prevailing over its military substance.''
   But the focus of his remarks was on the subject of German unity,
which has gained increasing attention with the opening of borders
between the two countries.
   Shevardnadze the question of borders in Europe was settled
permanently but the Germanys retained the right to
self-determination.
   He said there should be ``due regard for the special position of
the two German states and their responsibility to assure all
nations of Europe and the world that a threat of war will never
again come from the German soil.''
   He said a number of questions remained unanswered.
   ``Where are the ... guarantees that German unity would not
eventually create a threat to the national security of other states
and to peace in Europe,'' he asked.
   He wondered where a united Germany would fit into
military-political structures. ``One cannot seriously expect the
status of (East Germany) to change radically while the status of
(West Germany) would remain the same,'' he said.
   ``Surely the peoples of the Soviet Union are entitled to know
what any changes in Central Europe would mean for their future and
their security,'' he said. ``We paid the price of 20 million lives
for the existing European stability.''
   ``Furthermore, can the German people themselves forget the
national tragedy brought onto them by Hitlerism,'' he said.

<HEAD>Source Says Bush Warned Gorbachev on Baltic Violence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush told Mikhail S. Gorbachev at
the Malta summit that using force to block non-violent independence
movements in the three Baltic Republics would damage U.S.-Soviet
relations, a senior administration source said Tuesday.
   ``I think the Soviet leadership understands our position on this
very clearly,'' said the U.S. official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Meanwhile, an emigre Baltic diplomat who was briefed by U.S.
officials on the discussion said he was told that Gorbachev
responded that violence would not be used under his reform.
However, Gorbachev made no specific promises on the Baltics, whose
independence he has opposed, the diplomat said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III received similar
assurances from his Soviet counterpart in September. The
conversation at Malta was significant because the independence
movements are gaining strength.
   The United States never recognized the Soviet annexation of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia after World War II.
   Under Gorbachev's reforms, those three republics, with a
combined population of 7 million, have been striving for
independence. Gorbachev has said that post-war Soviet borders
cannot be changed.
   Bush's conversation with Gorbachev was not disclosed in the days
immediately after the Dec. 2-3 summit, but representatives of the
three emigre Baltic governments were briefed Monday by Assistant
Secretary of State Raymond Seitz.
   By warning Gorbachev against the use of force, Bush assisted the
Baltic independence movements, said Stasys Lozoraitis, charge
d'affaires at the Washington legation of the Lithuania. The exile
governments of the three republics have maintained legations in
Washington since they lost their independence.
   ``If they do not use violence, we can slowly and carefully do
what we need to do,'' Lozoraitis said.
   Leaders of the Lithuanian popular front Sajudis are predicting a
victory in February elections to the republican parliament and plan
to use their majority to secede from the Soviet Union, a step that
is legal under the Soviet constitution.
   The administration source said that Bush and ``the secretary of
state have made clear our legal position, that we do not recognize
the incorporation, and that their status ought to be a matter of
self-determination. We have no particular view as to the outcome.'''
   A key point of the U.S. position, said the source, was that the
process ``should be peaceful.'' The exchange on the issue at Malta,
the source said ``wasn't really a dialogue. It was a presenting of
views.''

<TEXT>
   KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov said Tuesday it
was an ``injustice'' to exile Andrei D. Sakharov to Gorky for
nearly seven years _ a period of physical hardship and KGB
harassment for the late human rights activist.
   In a wide-ranging news conference with a group of female
journalists, the KGB head also predicted Soviets will be less
fearful of his agency after new laws are passed defining its
actions in investigations, including the use of informers and
wiretaps.
   ``I think criminals should be scared of the KGB but innocent
people shouldn't,'' he said. But he acknowledged ``there is
reason'' for ordinary citizens to be scared after years of
repression of supposed internal enemies.
   ``I think that when we pass a law on the KGB, it will do a lot
to calm the situation,'' Kryuchkov said.
   Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize for his protests
of human rights violations in the Soviet Union, was buried Monday
with the pomp and respect due a national hero, three years after he
was released from his exile of January 1980-December 1986.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and half the Politburo attended a
memorial service. Kruchkov was not among them.
   Many mourners blamed the KGB for Sakharov's poor health.
Sakharov, 68, had been drugged and force-fed during a hunger strike
while in Gorky, and a doctor warned him, ``We won't let you die,
but we will make you an invalid.''
   Kryuchkov on Tuesday said, ``Our activities should be aimed at
defending human rights.'' Of the treatment given Sakharov, he said
``it was an injustice.''
   Still, the amiable KGB chief's line was not quite consistent. In
written answers to questions, he said, ``We have tightened
requirements for observation of laws,'' and ``alternative
applications'' of laws have been eliminated.
   Yet in verbal responses, he exonerated previous KGB
administrations and much of his current staff. ``The law was
imperfect, but people were abiding by it,'' he said.
   Security forces, he said in another statement, ``fought not
against different-mindedness but against specific illegal acts.''
   Thousands of Soviets were imprisoned for their political beliefs
under a law banning ill-defined ``anti-Soviet activities.'' The law
was rescinded last spring.
   The three-hour meeting with Kryuchkov was the latest sign of the
KGB's greater attention to its image, both at home and aboard. He
met the journalists at KGB headquarters in downtown Moscow, a site
that still strikes fear into many Soviets. KGB stands for
``Committee for State Security.''
   Kryuchkov, a member of the Communist Party's ruling Politburo,
also gave a clear indication that the leadership is leaning toward
acceptance of Sakharov's last call, a demand for removal from the
Constitution of Article 6, which guarantees the party's monopoly on
power.
   ``There is nothing eternal under the sun,'' he said. ``I'm
talking about politics. The leadership is not going to hold onto
Article 6.''
   ``If our Congress decides to abolish or leave out this article,
there will be no tragedy,'' he said.
   The Congress of People's Deputies heeded arguments from
Gorbachev and voted 1,139 to 839 last week against placing the
issue on the agenda of its current session. Only months ago,
Sakharov was one of the few Soviets who dared mention the question
publicly. But as one country after another in Eastern Europe
abolished similar provisions under pressure of massive
demonstrations and strikes, Gorbachev's position has softened.
   The Lithuanian parliament voted two weeks ago to eliminate a
similar article from its constitution and substitute a multiparty
system.
   The KGB chief noted the Constitution now treats the Communist
Party as the leading organization, ``though it may not be true.''
He predicted the party would have to fight for its position in the
future.
   Later, he added, ``We are analyzing what is going on in Eastern
Europe. We are trying to learn from these mistakes and from these
events.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Herbert Blaize, who
hailed the 1983 U.S.-led invasion of Grenada as a ``rescue
mission'' that restored democracy and who won the election that
followed, died Tuesday after a long illness. He was 71.
   Sir Paul Scoon, the British governor-general, named Deputy Prime
Minister Ben Jones to succeed Blaize until general elections are
held.
   Scoon appealed for calm and asked the nation to lend the new
prime minister their support. He noted that elections for a new
government will be held shortly, but set no date.
   Grenada, the most southerly of the Windward Islands in the
Caribbean, was due to hold general elections by March 1990, but the
vote could be advanced.
   Blaize suffered for years from prostate cancer and crippling
arthritis. He died at his official Mount Royal residence, Scoon
announced. No cause of death was stated.
   Blaize walked with the aid of a cane and received regular cancer
treatment at Walter Reed Hospital in Washington. He had become
increasingly frail and was unable to raise his voice above a
whisper at a political luncheon this month.
   He was elected prime minister on Dec. 3, 1984, in the first
election after U.S. troops, supported by a small Caribbean force,
invaded Grenada on Oct. 24-28, 1983, and ousted a Marxist military
junta that had seized power and assassinated Prime Minister Maurice
Bishop.
   The invasion was widely criticized abroad as a breach of
Grenada's sovereignty, but Blaize said it saved Grenada from a
brutal clique that placed the 100,000 residents under a 24-hour
curfew.
   ``It was God who sent the Americans and Caribbean forces to
deliver them (Grenadians),'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press in October 1988.
   Scoon, Queen Elizabeth II's representative in the former British
colony, called the main opposition members of Parliament in for
talks Tuesday on forming a successor government.
   Blaize had clung to power despite failing health, political
bickering that cost him the party leadership, and a growing public
clamor over what many called his authoritarian style of leadership.
   Herbert Augustus Blaize, born on Feb. 26, 1918, the son of a
laborer, on the Grenadian offshore island of Carriacou, became
leader of the Grenada National Party in 1959, and headed the
government from 1962 to 1967.
   Grenada became independent from Britain in 1974.
   After the 1983 invasion, a coalition of centrist parties was
cobbled together under the banner of the New National Party to
prevent a possible election victory by Sir Eric Gairy, a populist
who was ousted as prime minister in a 1979 leftist coup.
   Gairy's former administration had been riven by charges of
corruption and repression.
   Blaize, a Reagan administration favorite, was chosen to head the
coalition because of his previous government experience.
   His popularity declined with the government's inability to
improve the economy and put a dent in Grenada's 20-percent
unemployment rate.
   Since the invasion, the United States has pumped more than $100
million into Grenada, but a widely expected foreign investment boom
never materialized and U.S. aid dropped off.
   Blaize is survived by his wife, Venetia, and their three sons
and three daughters.
   A memorial service will be held Friday at St. George's Anglican
Church, with funeral and burial Sunday in Carriacou.

   An Amtrak train smashed into a
tractor-trailer in dense fog and derailed Tuesday, killing three
people and injuring 54 others, authorities reported.
   The engineer and fireman of the locomotive were killed when the
engine careened off the tracks, overturned and exploded, the
California Highway Patrol said. The patrol said the driver of the
truck, which was loaded with chocolate syrup, also was killed.
   ``I was collecting tickets and then all hell broke loose,'' said
conductor Gary Burke. ``I wound up flying into the next car.''
   ``It was like a nightmare,'' said passenger Phyllis Ferguson of
Stockton. ``I was sitting there reading the paper and then crash,
fire. I was thrown to the floor. Seats crumpled ahead and behind
me. Everybody was screaming and yelling.''
   Several passengers said the train and ground were so covered
with chocolate from the truck that they slipped when they tried to
leave the train.
   The train, traveling southbound from Oakland to Bakersfield on
Amtrak's San Joaquin route, was carrying at least 141 passengers.
   Patrol spokesman Bob Whitmire said 54 passengers were injured.
He said 23 seriously injured people were taken by ambulances to
area hospitals, and 31 with less serious injuries were taken by bus.
   He said 87 uninjured passengers were taken to the Riverbank
Amtrak station, about 20 miles south of the crash site.
   Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd said the train was going about 70
mph when it hit the truck. ``Evidently the vehicle ignored lights
and went right in front of the train,'' Lloyd said.
   The patrol, however, said the cause of the crash was not
immediately known. Whitmire said a motorist behind the truck
reported not seeing warning lights.
   The patrol said the locomotive, pulling five passenger cars,
derailed after striking the truck, about five miles southeast of
Stockton. The train left Stockton at 9:29 a.m.
   The Amtrak locomotive overturned and burst into flames which
took crews 90 minutes to extinguish. The truck was demolished,
broken into hundreds of pieces, while its load of chocolate syrup
coated two of the five passengers cars of the train.
   The first passenger car came to rest crosswise across the tracks
with one side torn open, and the second car overturned. The final
three also derailed, but remained upright.
   Claire Austin, a spokeswoman for the Federal Railroad
Administration in Washington, D.C., said the train was traveling
within the speed limit.
   ``On that stretch of track the speed limit is 79 mph,'' she
said. When asked whether the train should have slowed because of
the thick fog, she said that there were ``no clamps on speed on
that track because of weather conditions.''
   It was uncertain whether dense fog that has made San Joaquin
Valley roads dangerous in recent days played a factor in the
accident.
   The National Weather Service reported there had been zero
visibility almost constantly since Monday night in the northern San
Joaquin Valley. Dense fog caused a 69-vehicle pileup near Tracy,
west of Stockton, Monday morning, and a series of accidents
involved 55 vehicles farther south in Merced County.

   Roseanne Barr's threat to leave her top-rated
``Roseanne'' doesn't worry ABC's programs chief, who said Tuesday
he assumes she'll do a third season of the television comedy series.
   Robert A. Iger said he hasn't discussed the matter with Barr,
but just ``took a wait-and-see attitude. I'm not that worried.''
   ``I'm outta there,'' Barr said earlier this month on NBC's
``Today'' show when asked what she'd do with her television career
if her movie ``She-Devil'' was a hit. If the movie flopped, she
said, ``I'm going to leave TV anyway.''
   ``I've spoken with her since that quote. ... I didn't address
that comment at all,'' Iger said. ``I just let it go.
   ``She has a contract to do the program and I assume she'll be
back.''
   Iger, ABC Entertainment president, spoke at a news conference
where he also said:
   _ ABC has ordered eight episodes of ``Elvis,'' a new half-hour
dramatic series about rock idol Elvis Presley's early years in the
mid-'50s. The new show may premiere in February, rather than March,
when ABC's other mid-season replacement series will begin.
   _ James L. Brooks, writer of such TV comedy hits as ``The Mary
Tyler Moore Show,'' ``Taxi,'' and ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' has
signed an exclusive ABC deal to develop comedies for the network.
   _ He's ``not aware of any backlash'' from ABC affiliates over
the network's unusual decision earlier this year to try selling
programs to its network rivals, including NBC, with whom ABC is
working on a development deal.
   Conceding that ABC's decision ``raises eyebrows,'' Iger said it
was necessary if Brandon Stoddard, president of ABC Productions, is
to attract top creative talent for the network's production
division.
   Top talent might balk if limited to just one potential buyer, he
said, and that's why ABC made its decision ``to allow him to sell
in multiple directions, including another network.''
   ``I know it's under way,'' he said of the NBC-ABC deal. ``I do
not know the status of it at this time.'' He didn't elaborate on
the project.
   He said there has been talk of NBC offering ABC a ``potential
movie ... but to my knowledge that's not in the present
development.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists have gotten their first good
look at Redoubt Volcano and say most of its steam and volcanic ash
seems to be erupting from a single small vent about two-thirds of
the way up the mountain.
   The abrasive airborne ash, which could clog aircraft engines,
delayed or detoured air traffic in and out of Anchorage, stacking
up thousands of travelers and tons of mail. Among the stranded
travelers were 70 Korean Air Lines passengers who have refused
since Saturday to get on a plane.
   Anchorage International Airport was open Tuesday, but service
was irregular, with some airlines grounding aircraft and others
offering limited service. Some domestic airlines canceled flights
and international carriers routed their aircraft around Anchorage.
   Hunreds of stranded passengers were camping out in airports in
Anchorage and Seattle and the backlog began to affect airports as
far away as Salt Lake City.
   The sky cleared enough Monday to allow airborne scientists to
get close to the 10,197-foot mountain for the first time since it
began erupting Thursday.
   The Alaska Volcano Observatory, a joint center for state and
federal scientists, reported that the hot, gritty material was
coming from a vent less than 600 feet in diameter between the
8,000- and 8,500-foot level of the mountain.
   No lava was observed in the vent or elsewhere in the volcano's
crater, scientists reported.
   While the mountain continued to blow spectacular plumes up to
30,000 feet, scientists said most of the material was steam. They
said volcanic ash blanketed the volcano's southeast flank.
   They also observed a curtain of steam rising from a glacier on
the north side of the volcano. They said the steam appeared to be
the result of water flowing from the vent down the glacier and into
the Drift River.
   Water from melting snow and ice is contained in the normal
channel of the river, which flooded extensively when the volcano
last erupted more than two decades ago.
   While emissions from the mountain appeared to contain less ash
than before, the Federal Aviation Administration continued to warn
pilots of the hazards of additional volcanic activity because of
the abrasive ash. A notice advised that suitable alternative
airports may not be available should aircraft be forced to divert
from Anchorage.
   About 70 Korean Air Lines passengers remained in Anchorage on
Tuesday because of flight safety, said Lee Steiner, KAL's customer
relations manager in Los Angeles.
   Flight 25 with 240 passengers was en route from New York to
Seoul on Saturday when it landed in Anchorage. The flight was
delayed and passengers were taken to hotels.
   Then rumors started about the danger of flying near the ash
clouds and about half the passengers refused to reboard their plane.
   All but the 70 stay-behinds got on a KAL flight early Tuesday,
Steiner said. He said the airline was paying their bills.
   Steiner said those staying in Anchorage would be put aboard the
next available flight to Korea. ``But we don't know when that will
be at this point,'' he said. ``It depends on the climatic
conditions.''
   Last Friday, volcanic ash from Redoubt shut down all four
engines of a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines 747, causing the plane to
glide from 25,000 feet to 12,000 feet in 12 minutes before the crew
could restart the clogged engines.
   Anchorage, with almost half the state's population, has escaped
most of the ash settling to the ground in a fine, gray layer. The
heaviest ash concentrations were reported over the Kenai Peninsula
and Prince William Sound.
   Redoubt is located in a sparsely populated area 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage in the Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.
   No injuries have been reported in the eruptions, but one family
was removed Sunday from a lodge in the shadow of the volcano. They
were in no immediate danger. Another couple remains at a lodge
north of the peak.

Tuesday who ignored an order to stop his motorcycle at a security

   Curfew was suspended for eight hours in Srinagar, the summer
capital of northern Jammu-Kashmir state, for the second time since
it was imposed Friday.
   Srinagar and four other towns were put under curfew after a
celebration by Moslem separatists turned violent. The separatists

   The motorcyclist was identified by police as Ghulam Hassan Raja.
   At least eight people now have died in violence arising from the

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A new Cabinet was sworn in Tuesday
after Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril replaced seven ministers, the police
chief and a top army officer in the biggest government shakeup
since he took power last year.
   Franck Paultre, the former public works minister, replaced
Leonce Thelusma as finance minister in the reshuffle, announced on
state-run TV late Monday.
   Thelusma was criticized for his foreign currency-control policy
and for having signed a controversial agreement with the
International Monetary Fund.
   Brig. Gen. Fritz Romulus, the former airport chief who was newly
promoted from colonel, replaced Brig. Gen. Acedius Saint-Louis as
defense and interior minister.
   Saint-Louis drew fire as being ineffective in fighting urban
gangsterism. Romulus, reputed to be a moderate, is the only
military man in the 13-member Cabinet.
   Serge Petit-Frere replaced Remy Zamor as education minister.
   Teachers accused Zamor of authoritarianism. They struck several
times, protesting they had not been paid. They overwhelmingly
rejected an insurance plan Zamor presented for teachers and it was
shelved.
   Also replaced were the ministers of commerce, planning,
agriculture and public administration.
   Col. Henri Robert Augustin, the police chief, was replaced by
Lt. Col. Martial Romulus, who was military attache at the Haitian
Embassy in Washington.
   Maj. Gen. Max Valles, one of Haiti's nine generals, was retired.
For six weeks in 1986, Valles was a member of the provisional junta
which took over after dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into
French exile.
   Avril came to power in a bloodless coup in September 1988 that
ousted Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.

   Britain's worst flu epidemic in 15 years claimed
at least 102 more lives this month, raising the death toll to 126,
according to government figures released Tuesday.
   Doctors estimate that more than 1 million Britons are suffering
from the English flu, a variant of Hong Kong flu that swept Britain
in the winter of 1974-75.
   The Royal Society of General Practitioners said infection levels
have reached epidemic levels.
   Most of the latest deaths, all recorded in the first week of
December, were of people over age 65, according to the Office of
Population Censuses and Surveys that monitors flu deaths year-round.
   In Geneva, the World Health Organization said influenza was also
spreading through Continental Europe.
   Karin Esteves, of the WHO's Division of Communicable Diseases,
said the outbreak in Britain was not as serious as in the earlier
epidemic.
   ``But we don't think it has already peaked,'' she told The
Associated Press in the telephone interview.
   She said that in France, the disease is spreading rapidly from
Paris and into the South. Reports from Belgium, Switzerland and the
Soviet Union also suggest the flu outbreak is growing worse in
those places.
   She added that occasional vaccine shortages may occur because of
the high demand.
   Symptoms of the disease include fatigue, aching muscles,
headaches, coughing and prolonged fever lasting four or five days.

<HEAD>Man Charged With War Crimes to be Freed on Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 72-year-old native of Byelorussia was granted
bail Tuesday pending trial on charges he murdered 490 people,
mostly Jews, during World War II.
   The Ontario Supreme Court ordered Michael Pawlowski, who has
lived in Canada for 38 years, to put up his modest brick bungalow
in Renfrew, Ontario, as security.
   Pawlowski was arrested Monday in Renfrew, about 60 miles west of
Ottawa, and charged with eight counts of murder _ four under
Criminal Code provisions dealing with war crimes and four with
crimes against humanity.
   He is accused of murdering 410 Jews and 80 non-Jewish Poles in
1942 in the Byelorussian republic of the Soviet Union _ 400 Jews in
the small village of Snov, 10 more who escaped the first killings,
and 80 Poles in the same region.
   No mention was made in the charges as to whether Pawlowski was
serving in a military unit at the time.
   Historians estimate that thousands of Jews died during the Nazi
occupation of Byelorussia from 1941-43, most of them victims of
special killing squads organized by the Germans or local
collaborators.
   Pawlowski, described as a horticulturist, came to Canada in 1951
and five years later became a Canadian citizen.
   Under federal legislation passed two years ago, Canadian
residents can be tried here for war crimes or crimes against
humanity committed elsewhere. Since 1987 the government has moved
against two other accused war criminals.
   The war crimes unit was set up after a royal commission
recommended urgent action against 20 suspects who came to Canada
after World War II.
   Defense lawyer Don Bayne indicated the case is not likely to
come to trial until next fall.
   Friends and neighbors of Pawlowski were shocked by the charges,
calling him a quiet and likable man who won prizes for his flowers
and the homegrown vegetables he sold at a local farmer's market.
   While being granted bail, he was ordered to report weekly to
police and to refrain from leaving the Renfrew-Ottawa area without
permission.
   Pawlowski married in 1968. He and his wife Maria have no
children.

   Temperatures hit record lows Tuesday from the western Plains to
the East Coast, including one at 26 below zero, and light snow fell
across the Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and the Northwest.
   Tuesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 35 degrees below zero
at Bismarck, N.D., not a record.
   By noon, temperatures over much of the upper Mississippi Valley
and northern Plains had not risen above zero.
   In stark contrast, southern Florida had record warmth in the
upper 80s.
   Since Friday, at least 38 deaths have been blamed on the
weather, including traffic deaths on slippery roads and hypothermia.
   Michigan outreach centers pleaded for warm clothes to give to
help the needy stave off the unusual cold. The average mean
temperature in Michigan for the first 18 days of December was 14.1
degrees, far below the month's norm of 23.5 degrees.
   ``I don't recall a December being quite this cold,'' Detroit
police Sgt. George Anthony said Tuesday as he leafed through
reports about victims of hypothermia. Two freezing deaths have been
confirmed in Wayne County and at least three others are believed to
be hypothermia.
   An inch or more of snow covered much of the nation north of a
line from east-central Virginia across north-central Tennessee,
northern Arkansas, southern Colorado and northwestern Utah to
northwestern Idaho, the National Weather Service said.
   At midday, snow fell over western New York state, much of the
western half of Pennsylvania, eastern and northern Ohio, West
Virginia, much of Virginia, eastern Kentucky, Michigan, Montana,
Idaho, western Wyoming and eastern Washington state.
   There were no reports of measurable snowfall during the six
hours up to 1 p.m. EST, except in northwestern Indiana, where
Westville had 5 inches of new snow by noon, the weather service
said. Up to 4 inches fell early in the day in Illinois.
   A winter storm warning, in effect into Wednesday, was posted
over northwestern Montana.
   Freezing rain fell from northeastern Texas across northern
Louisiana and southern Arkansas, and over eastern Tennessee, much
of North and South Carolina and northeastern Georgia, where the
accumulating ice caused scattered power outages and glazed highways.
   More than 100 motorists stranded overnight at Hope, Ark., by ice
on Interstate 30 were able to get back on the road Tuesday.
   ``We escorted about 104 people to the Community Center last
night, starting around 9 p.m. and finishing at about one this
morning,'' Hope Police Chief Richard Thomas said.
   In addition, officials said hotels in the area were full while
other motorists spent the night in their vehicles. ``Wal-Mart's
parking lot was full of 18-wheelers,'' Thomas said.
   Some 70 school districts across Arkansas remained closed Tuesday
because of the inclement weather. State office workers were under
the state's inclement weather policy, which gives non-essential
administrative workers until 10 a.m. to arrive without being
deducted leave time.
   Many northern Georgia counties kept their schools closed,
although most Atlanta area schools reopened after being closed
Monday.
   Officials in Griffin, Ga., said ice brought tree limbs down on
power lines there, cutting electricity to large sections of the
city for as long as two hours.
   Ice on roads was blamed for accidents around metropolitan
Atlanta and Athens, and police blocked off several interstate
highway ramps that were littered with cars and trucks unable to
cross slick spots.
   Treacherous driving conditions in North Carolina caused at least
one death and scores of traffic accidents, and dozens of schools
and business closed.
   Rain fell from the remainder of Georgia into northern Florida
and northern Alabama, and was scattered along the Gulf of Mexico
coast.
   In the mountains of southeastern Wyoming, wind blew at 50 to 60
mph near Arlington and near Vedauwoo.
   A 200-mile stretch of the Mississippi River, from St. Louis to
Cairo, Ill., was closed to barge traffic by ice and low water, the
U.S. Coast Guard said.
   About 60 percent of the 195 miles of Missouri River north of
Omaha, Neb., to the Gavins Point Dam was frozen over Tuesday,
forming ice jams that reduced the amount of water flowing
downstream to towns and power plants.
   The river level was within one foot of the level at which some
power plants would be unable to operate because their water intake
systems would no longer work, said Chet Worm, chief of the
reservoir regulation section of the Corps Missouri River District.
   Record low temperatures were 8 at Atlantic City, N.J.; 6 at
Baltimore; 10 at Bridgeport, Conn.; 26 below zero at Dickinson,
N.D.; 6 below at Elkins, W.Va.; 19 below at Grand Island, Neb.; 5
at Harrisburg, Pa.; 20 below at Lincoln, Neb.; 24 below at Norfolk,
Neb.; 7 below at Wheat Ridge, Colo.; and 3 below at Youngstown,
Ohio.
   But in Florida, Miami hit a record high of 85 and West Palm
Beach reached a record 88.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 18
degrees below zero at Detroit Lakes and International Falls, Minn.,
to 87 at West Palm Beach.

   A loaded oil tanker ran aground in dense fog
Tuesday in the Suez Canal, blocking traffic in both directions,
shipping officials said.
   Canal officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Liberian-registered Lauberhorn was stalled in the waterway a few
miles north of Suez, the southern entrance to the 107-mile-long
canal that connects the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Suez.
   According to Lloyds Registry of Shipping, the accident is the
Lauberhorn's second during its trip from Iran to Turkey. On Nov.
28, it ran aground off el-Mocha, North Yemen, about 60 miles north
of the Red Sea entrance.
   The ship, carrying oil to Turkey from an Iranian terminal in the
Persian Gulf, was refloated early this month and resumed its
journey northward five days ago.
   The Suez Canal Authority rushed five tugs and other craft to the
scene to attempt refloating the 138,536-ton tanker. Canal officials
said the accident did not cause an oil leak.
   By nightfall, refloating teams were still at work but the tanker
was blocking the waterway, a major lane for commercial shipping, in
both directions.
   Canal officials said two convoys from the northern end of the
waterway with a total of 28 ships were diverted to the Great Bitter
Lakes, about 28 miles north of Suez. Another 12 ships behind the
Lauberhorn were stalled in the waterway.
   The Liberian-flagged tanker is managed by Brokerage and
Management Co. of New York, according to Lloyd's Registry.

   Stiff high-altitude wind Tuesday
night forced Martin Marietta to postpone for the fourth time the
maiden launch of its commercial Titan 3 rocket.
   ``The upper level winds are too strong for Titan this evening,''
launch commentator Bob Gordon said. The announcement came after the
countdown reached the five-minute mark and was held there for a
weather evaluation.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:21 p.m. Wednesday.
   The Titan 3 was to boost into orbit communications satellites
for a Japanese company and the British Ministry of Defence.
   High wind at an altitude of 27,000 feet also caused a scrub
Monday night. Technical and weather problems caused two
postponements earlier in the month.

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering hailed
the 44th General Assembly Tuesday as ``one of the most
constructive, realistic sessions in recent memory'' for its
approach to human rights, disarmament and other issues.
   Pickering, in a reception for reporters, praised the 159-member
assembly for ``stepping away from governments which have come to
power without the support of the people; respect for human rights;
and a willingness to come to grips with such worldwide concerns as
drugs, human rights, terrorism and the environment.''
   He noted the assembly, which opened in September, had embraced a
consensus position on many issues, echoing the cooperative approach
to the West initiated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Those who defended authoritarian regimes or clung to failed
political and economic ways were clearly out of step at this
session,'' he said, referring to Cuba, Panama and Nicaragua.
   ``The 44th General Assembly set the scene for a concrete
chemical arms control initiative by President Bush and a positive
response from Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze,''
Pickering said.
   During his speech to the assembly in September, Bush proposed
deep cuts in the U.S. and Soviet poison gas stockpiles.
Shevardnadze endorsed that idea but counterproposed ending
production of chemical weapons as well. U.S. and Soviet negotiators
are now reconciling the two approaches.
   ``The general debate set the tone, with speeches which stressed
optimism and pragmatism, downplayed confrontation and welcomed
improved East-West relations and the U.N.'s renewed activism in
helping to resolve regional conflicts,'' Pickering said.
   ``This session had its down sides as well,'' he noted.
``Unbalanced resolutions on the Middle East, Central America and
SoUthern africa continue to be pursued here,'' he said.
   Last week, Vice President Dan Quayle visited the United Nations
and said the assembly should repeal its 1975 ``Zionism is Racism''
resolution.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vladimir Petrovsky said later in
the week that his country did not favor a repeal, saying it would
provoke a confrontation.
   Pickering said the United States would push for repeal only when
sensed it would win on the issue, saying a defeat would have the
effect of giving renewed emphasis to the original resolution.
   Among the areas of agreement cited by Pickering were consensus
resolutions to ban driftnet fishing on the high seas; calling for a
free and sovereign Afghanistan; opposing terrorism; denouncing
apartheid and calling for a non-racial, democratic society in South
Africa.
   Pickering praised the record number of votes in favor of a
comprehensive political settlement to the Cambodian conflict, and
record number of votes against the annual Arab attempt to eject
Israel from the assembly.
   Namibia's free and fair elections were a highlight of the year,
he said, as were resolutions criticizing human rights violations in
Iran, Afghanistan, El Salvador and Chile.
   Pickering criticized the Palestine Liberation Organization's
attempt to upgrade its status from an organization to a non-voting
member nation, saying America ``preferred that this issue had never
been raised.''
   Action on that move was deferred until at least next year after
the United States threatened to cut off its $216 million annual
dues payment.
   On Friday, the assembly concludes its annual fall session.

<HEAD>Bush Meets on Military Role in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush met with Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Tuesday to
weigh a wider role for the military in the war on drugs,
administration officials said.
   The subject of the Oval Office session was a recent Justice
Department legal opinion suggesting the U.S. military could legally
arrest drug offenders overseas.
   Bush advocated use of the military for raids on strongholds of
drug kingpins during last year's presidential campaign. He hinted
at a military role in his Sept. 6 anti-drug speech to the nation,
but at the times aides said he did not envision an overseas mission.
   However, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday's
session was ``to sort all this out,'' including possible use of the
military to interdict drug traffickers in the source countries.
   Bush has expressed recent frustration with the increase of
drug-related violence in Colombia and with his inability to
influence events in Panama. Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio
Noriega is under indictment in Florida on drug trafficking charges.
   At Tuesday's White House session, Cheney presented a preliminary
report on the role of the military in the anti-drug effort to Bush,
said White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen. ``A final strategy will be
forthcoming,'' she said.
   White House officials over the weekend acknowledged receiving
the Justice Department opinion and said it was being studied.
   The legal opinion said that the 1878 law which prohibits the
military from funtioning as a police agency on U.S. soil has no
bearing overseas.
   The report was written by Assistant Attorney General William P.
Barr, head of the Justice Department's office of legal counsel, in
November at the behest of the White House. Its existence was
disclosed last week.
   At the Pentagon Tuesday, spokesman Pete Williams said the legal
opinion would not automatically mean an expanded military role in
the drug war.
   ``It's a Justice Department option, not a policy,'' he said.

   A man accused of killing a police
officer surrendered Tuesday after holding a family hostage and
telling a television station he shot the officer in the head
because he ``was calling me a worm.''
   Police arrested Phillip Cole, 29, after Cole tossed out his gun,
raised his hands and walked out of a rural Lester Prairie farmhouse
around 5:15 a.m., said Hutchinson police Sgt. Scott Schwartz.
   During the standoff, Cole spoke on the telephone with WCCO-TV in
Minneapolis, telling the station that he shot police officer
Michael Hogan.
   ``He was calling me a worm. He was calling me a punk. He said he
was going to take me in. I shot him in the head,'' Cole told the
station.
   ``It was the stupidest thing I did in my life because it's
costing me my life,'' Cole said.
   Cole, who is charged with second-degree murder in the death last
Friday, was taken under heavy security to McLeod County Jail in
Glencoe, Schwartz said.
   Second-degree murder and theft charges also were filed Tuesday
against two women and a man arrested Friday in Hutchinson, a town
of about 10,000 people 60 miles west of Minneapolis, in connection
with Hogan's death.
   The three others, whom authorities allege were part of a
shoplifting ring with Cole, were each held in lieu of $125,000
bail, McLeod County Attorney Michael Junge said.
   Junge said murder charges were filed because ``they should have
and could have foreseen that, based on Mr. Cole's violent nature
and the fact that he carried a weapon, their shoplifting could
easily escalate to a shooting.''
   He said more than $1,000 in merchandise was recovered from the
van the three were in when they were arrested.
   Police would not say what charges were being considered.
   Hogan, a 16-year police veteran, was shot to death in a private
room at the J.C. Penney store in Hutchinson while he was
interviewing Cole as part of a shoplifting investigation.
   The funeral for the 43-year-old officer was held in Hutchinson
on Tuesday. About 600 people attended, at least half of them law
enforcement officials from around Minnesota.
   After Hogan was shot, Cole allegedly escaped by commandeering a
car to the Twin Cities, authorities said. On Sunday and Monday,
police surrounded three different Minneapolis homes, believing Cole
was hiding in each. But they failed to find him.
   As police surrounded the third home late Monday night, Cole was
able to get away and take a car driven by a woman who also became a
hostage, authorities said.
   Officers began chasing Cole after an officer tried to pull his
car over for a minor traffic violation in Minnetonka, said McLeod
County Sheriff Duane Kopesky.
   Cole's car rolled over and Cole, who has a long record of
violence and imprisonment, ran from the accident to a farmhouse,
forcing a woman to go with him, authorities said.
   He then took Alan and Sandy Otto and their 2-year-old daughter
hostage in their home, Kopesky said.
   During the five-hour standoff, Kopesky said Cole's mother,
Grace, and one of his sisters were brought to the scene to talk to
him by telephone. The strategy helped convince Cole to give up,
Kopesky said.
   Steve Geiger, a police psychologist who assisted in the
negotiations, said, ``There were extreme threats to the hostages in
the house and it was very clear that Cole wavered between homicidal
and suicidal moments.''
   WCCO-TV reported that during the standoff Cole said he wanted to
say goodbye to his mother and sister and commit suicide.
   ``All I wanted was to talk to my family, you know, my family
members. And say goodbye to my friends and I was gonna let these
people walk out the door and I was gonna take my own life,'' Cole
told the station.
   ``I just want to tell them that, `Hey, I love ya, ya know. And
I'm sorry that this had to happen. I'm sorry it came down to
this,'' he said.
   The Ottos did not immediately return a telephone call Tuesday.
   Cole also told WCCO-TV that a police officer helped him avoid
capture by warning him of searches, but police Sgt. Phil VanTassel
said Cole's claim was ``ludicrous.''
   ``I believe it's a little outlandish,'' said Minneapolis Police
Chief John Laux, ``but on the other hand, I am having my internal
affairs commander review the tape and we'll look into it. ... I
haven't drawn any conclusions so early.''

   Sheriff's deputies collared a man
accused of taking his dog for a quick spin _ in a heavy-duty dryer.
   Kelly Gay, 32, was in custody Monday with bail set at $5,000
after he allegedly added the 5-year-old mixed terrier to a pile of
clothes to a dryer at a self-service laundry, dropped in his
quarters and turned it on, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt.
Terry Judge.
   Other customers rushed to the dryer, shut it off and called
sheriff's deputies. The male terrier was still in the dryer when
the deputies arrived, Judge said.
   ``They said it's cute as a button,'' Judge said. The terrier was
not seriously injured and given to the custody of animal control
workers, Judge said.
   Gay, who police described as a transient, was held for
investigation of animal cruelty.

<TEXT>
   Communist Premier Marian Calfa
endorsed opposition leader Vaclav Havel for president Tuesday,
signaling a major victory for the peaceful pro-democracy revolution
led by the playwright-activist.
   Parliamentary leaders met after a session of the
Communist-dominated Federal Assembly and agreed to reconvene it on
Dec. 29 to elect a new president. The meeting will be held at
Hradcany Castle, the presidential residence.
   Parliament late Tuesday also unanimously approved a new
government program outlining broad political and economic reforms,
including proposals to guarantee freedom of assembly and
association and freedom of religion.
   The program also calls for movement from a state-run economy
toward a free market system but no further details were immediately
available.
   Josef Bartoncik, head of the lower house and leader of the
People's Party, said his party would support Havel and that ``the
election would be in the interest of all citizens of our country.''
   The Socialists _ like the People's Party one of four small
parties in parliament _ also announced Tuesday it would support
Havel.
   In a speech to the Communist-dominated parliament, Calfa, urged
the deputies to elect a new president by the end of the year.
   ``It is the government's opinion that there is no alternative .
.. than to elect Vaclav Havel as president,'' Calfa said.
   He said the presidency should be filled at once in the
``interest of stability.''
   The presidency in Czechoslovakia is a largely ceremonial post,
but it has great symbolic importance because of the respect the
country's first president, Tomas Masaryk, enjoyed in the
independent Czechoslovakia he founded in 1918.
   Calfa said the new president should serve only until June or
July, when Czechoslovakia is to hold its first free elections in 43
years.
   Havel, whose works were banned when the uprising against rigid
Communist rule began a month ago, has said he would serve as
president only on an interim basis, until a replacement was chosen
by a democratically elected parliament.
   Havel was in prison as recently as May, when he completed a
four-month sentence on protest-related charges.
   Jockeying over the presidency has dominated politics for nearly
two weeks, after a series of stunning opposition triumphs forced
the Communists to relinquish their monopoly on power and name the
first government since 1948 not dominated by the party.
   Calfa's endorsement of Havel was an unprecedented show of
support. His government has been reported trying to overcome
resistance among Communist deputies to Havel's candidacy.
   Czechoslovakia has not had a president since Dec. 10, when
Gustav Husak, a member of the old guard, resigned after swearing in
the new government.
   Husak's resignation followed a series of leadership changes that
removed hard-line leaders associated with the crackdown after the
Warsaw Pact invasion that ended the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of
1968 led by Alexander Dubcek.
   Dubcek, later dismissed as party chief and assigned to an
obscure forestry job in Bratislava, also has been mentioned as a
potential presidential candidate.
   The Communist Party has been in disarray since a brutal police
crackdown on student protesters Nov. 17 started the anti-Communist
revolution.
   A two-day special party congress opens Wednesday in Prague, and
is expected to recommend more personnel and policy changes.

   The Brandenburg Gate, a towering
monument to unity that became a symbol of discord, will reopen by
Christmas after being closed by the Berlin Wall for a generation,
the government said Tuesday.
   State television reported the date after Premier Hans Modrow and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany held a summit and said the
gate would be opened on Christmas Eve but its editors late Tuesday
said the announcer had misread his text and that the date for
reopening was by Christmas Day.
   Modrow, Kohl and the mayors of East and West Berlin will preside
Sunday, the television report said.
   On Tuesday, West Berlin police began setting up crowd-control
barriers in front of the wall at the gate, which is in East Berlin.
   At their summit, Modrow and Kohl agreed to negotiate closer ties
between the two Germany's created at the end of World War II. The
Berlin Wall was built in 1961.
   Modrow said that visa-free travel between East and West Germany
will begin Christmas Eve and his government will free all political
prisoners.
   In a joint statement, the German leaders said ``a
good-neighborly relationship between the two states ... is of great
importance for stability in Europe and represents a contribution to
the new European architecture.''
   At a news conference after their meeting, Modrow would not be
specific about the Brandenburg Gate pedestrian crossing, but Kohl
said: ``We will all be able to take a walk across to the
Brandenburg Gate before Christmas.''
   The Brandenburg Gate was built 200 years ago and opened the road
to the region of Brandenburg in Prussia, but its six battle-scarred
sandstone columns became a symbol of division after the wall was
built in 1961. The gate, the size of a five-story building,
remained on the eastern side.
   In 1963, Communist soldiers dropped huge red drapes over the
gate to prevent President John F. Kennedy from looking into East
Berlin when he visited West Berlin.
   With the political upheaval that has ended Communist domination
in East Germany and opened the country's once-locked borders, the
gate is viewed by millions as the symbol of German unity.
   The issue of how to bring the nations closer dominated the first
meeting of Kohl and Modrow, and the public reaction highlighted the
debate raging over possible reunification after more than four
decades.
   Workers in hard hats left their jobs and joined thousands of
others to catch a glimpse of Kohl as he rode to the meeting in his
motorcade of black Mercedes limousines.
   ``Helmut! Helmut!'' and ``Germany, united fatherland!'' they
shouted.
   But posters in the city center read ``Kohl Go Home.''
   ``A Fourth Reich _ Is that why you stayed behind?'' said one,
referring to East Germans who have declined to emigrate to wealthy
West Germany, choosing instead to stay behind and help rebuild
their troubled socialist state.
   East German TV reported 5,000 people demonstrated against
reunification in East Berlin, shouting ``Nazis out!''
   Modrow opposes reunification, and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevadrdnadze reiterated the Kremlin's opposition to
reunification during a speech Tuesday to the European Parliament.
   ``It is necessary to proceed on the basis of the postwar
realities, namely, the existence of two sovereign German states.
... A retreat from that is fraught with destabilization in
Europe,'' he said.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe:
   _ Shooting and fires were reported in western Romania, where
there were reports that security forces have killed hundreds of
people who protested the harsh Communist regime of President
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   _ Former Czechoslovak dissident Vaclav Havel received an
endorsement for the presidency from the Communist premier, Marian
Calfa, who urged that he be elected before the end of the year.
   _ The Soviet Parliament pushed through an economic reform plan
that retains heavy central planning, in a no-confidence vote that
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his ministers easily survived.
   _ Lithuania's Communist Party leader urged a united political
front with other parties to press for sovereignty and protect the
Baltic republic from Kremlin pressure. Algirdis Brazauskas avoided
calling for an immediate, direct break with the Soviet Communist
Party or for Lithuanian indepenence, but he left open both
possibilities.
   The German summit began with the signing of an economic
cooperation agreement and pacts to boost cultural and travel ties.
   A significant development is the planned treaty to improve
cooperation and relations. Negotiations will start immediately,
Modrow said, with Kohl saying he hoped the treaty could be signed
by spring.
   The leaders planned a second summit in late January or early
February.
   Perhaps the most striking aspect of the summit was the welcome
Kohl received.
   Later, at an evening rally, a crowd of 20,000 burst into rounds
of wild cheers and applause as the West German leader addressed
them as his ``countrymen'' and promised not to abandon them.
   ``God bless our German fatherland,'' he said.
   Some, however, carried signs supporting East German sovereignty.
   Kohl spoke near the ruins of the Frauenkirche (Church of Our
Lady), destroyed during World War II. There Kohl laid a bouquet in
memory of war victims before addressing the flag-waving crowd.
   ``Unity! Unity! Unity!'' they shouted as he began to speak.
   Kohl promised West German aid for the economic recovery,
assuring the crowd: ``We will not desert our countrymen.''
   But mindful of warnings from East German leaders, the
superpowers and European neighbors that a reunited Germany could
threaten peace, Kohl promised East Germans: ``We will respect what
you decide for the future.''
   The last such summit was Sept. 7-8, 1987, in Bonn, when Kohl met
Honecker. The last time a West German chancellor visited East
Germany was in December 1981, when Helmut Schmidt met with Honecker
in Werbellinsee.

   Federal investigators are concentrating on a
possible racial motivation in the two fatal mail-bombings in the
South over the past four days, the Justice Department said Thursday.
   FBI Director William Sessions indicated that no suspect had been
identified in the bombings. ``As far as I know there's been no
claimant of responsibility at all,'' Sessions said at a news
conference at the Justice Department.
   He said, however, that ``in the back of all of our minds'' is
the possibility that the bombs were the result of racial feelings
over desegregation cases.
   Mail bombs killed 11th Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance at his home
near Birmingham, Ala., on Saturday, and Savannah, Ga., Alderman
Robert E. Robinson on Monday. In addition, authorities removed
bombs from a courthouse in Atlanta on Monday, and from the NAACP
headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla., on Tuesday.
   Vance recently wrote an opinion in a school desegregation case
that was a victory for the Jacksonville NAACP.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh called the incidents ``an
affront to our nation's commitment to the rule of law.''
   He said in a statement that the investigation is ``currently
concentrating on a possible racial motivation to the incidents
which have occurred in the past four days.''
   Thornburgh said he had contacted civil rights leaders ``to
assure them that we are fully committed to the vigorous
investigations of these crimes and the apprehension of the person
or persons who perpetuated them.''
   He stressed, however, that ``no firm conclusion'' about
motivation has been reached. And Sessions said, ``I would not rule
out drugs as potentially being involved but that is not a
conclusion'' that can be reached at this time.
   Sessions said the bureau was studying Vance's court docket to
determine if he participated in any cases that might have produced
racial anger.
   In September, Vance wrote the court's unanimous opinion that
ordered the Jacksonville, Fla., schools to continue busing to
achieve racial integration.
   The case was won by the Jacksonville NAACP, which had appealed a
lower court's ruling that busing could stop.
   An anonymous letter was sent from Atlanta to a Jackson, Miss.,
television station in August declaring war on the 11th Circuit, the
station, WAPT-TV, reported Tuesday night.
   ``We turned it right over to the FBI,'' said reporter Deanna Lee
in a telephone interview. Lee said the letter bore an Aug. 21
postmark. The day before that a tear-gas cannister exploded at the
NAACP headquarters in Atlanta, injuring eight people.
   FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz confirmed that the FBI had
opened an investigation into the letter soon after the television
station had passed it along.
   Sessions said the FBI did not detect any similarity between the
recent bomb incidents and activities of known white supremacist
groups ``but it is something you cannot rule out.''
   ``We would hope the patterns of these types of groups when
studied carefully and compared will yield fruit,'' Sessions said.
   Sessions ticked off a handful of federal agencies at work on the
cases, and offered blunt advice for anyone involved in the criminal
justice system who receives a suspicious package: ``Don't try to
open it.''
   ``I see no reason to panic but I see every reason to be
cautious,'' he said.
   Sessions brushed aside questions on the specifics of the case,
refusing to say whether the bombs were the work of experts, whether
the bomb to Vance bore a postmark of Newnan, Ga., and what
similarities, if any existed among the bombs.
   Asked about the complexity of the bombs, Sessions indicated that
they were not necessarily the work of explosive experts. ``I would
not comment about the specific devices themselves, but laymen have
been knwon to devise those kinds of instruments,'' Sessions said.
   As for a positive racial motivation, Sessions said, ``When the
NAACP headquarters receives a suspicious package, an alderman is
killed, you have to have that in the back of your mind.''
   Asked about a suspect, the FBI director said:
   ``I would not refer to any suspect at all if I had one at this
stage.''
   But he did say he thought it was ``quite possible there is more
than one person'' behind the crimes.
   Sessions said ``every available investigative resource is being
utilized'' to lead authorities to the ``perpetrator or perpetrators
of these horrible crimes.''
   In the meantime, he said the U.S. Marshals Service could keep
judges safe, and he appealed to all to exercise extreme care in
opening suspicious packages _ to the point of advising them to call
the return addressee to make sure a parcel was safe.
   Earlier Tuesday, authorities said the bombs that killed Vance
and Robinson were both packed with nails, suggesting links to the
device sent to the Atlanta courthouse.
   ``There's a strong similarity in the three explosive devices,
and it appears there is a relationship,'' FBI agent Tom Moore said
in Birmingham.
   A government source in Washington said the package containing
the bomb that killed Vance bore the return address of a another
11th Circuit judge, Lewis F. Morgan.
   Morgan, who had previously sent packages to Vance, is not a
suspect but the evidence suggests that the killer was famliar with
the two judges' friendship, said the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The bomb contained nails, and injured the judge's wife.
   In Savannah, Mayor John Rousakis said authorities confirmed that
nails also had been packed in the bomb that killed Robinson, who
had represented the NAACP in a long-running desegregation lawsuit
involving Savannah schools.
   The 11th Circuit, which considers federal cases from Georgia,
Florida and Alabama, had last month upheld the Savannah school
board's decision to change its desegregation plan.
   The NAACP had objected to the changes that were also approved by
a federal district judge. Vance did not participate in that case,
according to Julius Chambers, director of the NAACP Legal and
Educational Defense Fund, Inc.
   The nine judges on the 11th Circuit were under round-the-clock
guard, federal marshals said. The bomb removed without incident
from the court's Atlanta headquarters on Monday was addressed to
the ``Clerk of Court 11th Circuit,'' government sources said.

<TEXT>
   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, came to Jordan Tuesday for talks on the
proposal by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III for direct
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
   His two-day visit coincided with Prime Minister Mudar Badran's
announcement that Jordan was lifting martial law imposed 22 years
ago after Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 war.
   ``I will brief King Hussein on all that concerns our central
issue, the Palestinian issue ... and developments on the
Palestinian, Arab and international arenas because we are in one
trench,'' Arafat told reporters.
   ``Our relationship with Jordan is beyond the level of
coordination. ... We are one family and it gives me pleasure to
come to Jordan at anytime.''
   Badran and other Cabinet members met Arafat at the airport and
all drove to the Guest Palace, where Hussein was expected to join
them for talks.
   Arafat adviser Bassam Abu Sharif told The Associated Press the
talks will focus on ``concentrated efforts to open a
Palestinian-Israeli dialogue'' in Cairo and deal with ``Israeli
deviousness which tries to dampen and control all efforts for a
peaceful political solution to the Palestinian problem.''
   Baker proposed in October that the meetings between Palestinian
and Israeli delegations focus on Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's election plan for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The election is part of a wider plan for a limited self-rule for
1.7 million Palestinians living under occupation. The Palestinians
have been waging a bloody insurrection in the occupied lands since
Dec. 8, 1987.
   The PLO says it must name the Palestinian delegation and the
agenda must be open to all topics.
   Israel regards the PLO as a terrorist organization and rejects
any direct or indirect PLO involvement.
   Badran affirmed Jordan's support for the Palestinians saying:
``We in Jordan are all Palestinians when it comes to the
Palestinian issue.''
   ``We support all the efforts of the PLO because they work for
the benefit of the Palestinian cause.''
   In July 1988, Hussein renounced sovereignty over the West Bank,
turning over reponsibility to the PLO.
   More than half of Jordan's population of 3 million is of
Palestinian origin, and Badran is known for close ties with the PLO.
   In Tunis, the Tunisian capital where the PLO is headquartered,
the organization published a statement at the end of a three-day
leadership meeting which said, ``The United States' unlimited
support for the Israeli leadership is hampering the peace process
in the Middle East region.''
   But it said it was ready to open a dialogue with the Israelis on
the basis of principles laid down in Baghdad in October at the last
meeting of the PLO Central Council _ the PLO's right to pick
members of the Palestinian delegation and following the Cairo talks
with ``an international conference on peace in the Middle East with
the participation of Egypt and Sweden.''
   The lifting of martial law was the latest in a series of moves
by Prime Minister Badran and Hussein aimed at liberalizing
Jordanian society.
   Badran also promised to crack down on corruption among public
officials, and criticized former governments for deficit spending
that swelled Jordan's $8.3 billion foreign debt.
   The newly elected, 80-member legislature adjourned after hearing
the policy statement, and a vote of confidence was set for Dec. 30.
   Badran's 23-member Cabinet, which he formed Dec. 6, needs 41
votes to be installed. Otherwise, Hussein will have to appoint a
new prime minister.
   Most candidates in last month's general elections had called for
the lifting of martial law, under which authorities can close
newspapers at any time, effectively inhibiting free criticism of
officials.
   Martial law also banned large public meetings, provided for
special courts and allowed authorities to interfere in private
business dealings and control bank transactions.

<TEXT>
   The secretary-general of the powerful
Cyprus Communist Party denied Tuesday that the party is opposed to
perestroika and said none of its hard-line old guard intends to
resign.
   The statement came one day after the resignation of Michael
Papapetrou, a leading reformer in the party, which is known as
Akel. Papapetrou, 42, also resigned from Parliament, where he had
been a member since 1985.
   Papapetrou complained that most of Akel's Central Committee did
not support perestroika _ the political and economic restructuring
sought by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. His statement came
at the end of a five-day Central Committee meeting.
   Dissenters have accused the party of sticking to discredited
Stalinist methods.
   Papapetrou said the discussion ``indicated that the Central
Committee does not have the slightest intention to compromise ...
opening the way for reform and perestroika.''
   Demetris Christofias, 43, Akel's secretary-general, told a news
conference Papapetrou's resignation saddened him and the two would
meet to discuss the issues Papapetrou raised.
   ``We will proceed with the renewal of the party as decided by
the Central Committee meeting and will implement the message of
perestroika and new thinking...,'' he added.
   A statement issued after the Central Committee meeting condemned
the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, falling in line
with East bloc parties.
   Papapetrou and other reformers had publicly criticized the party
for stalling on such a denunciation.
   Christofias reacted angrily when asked if any old-guard members
of the 75-member committee, aged over 70, would resign in
recognition of past mistakes.
   ``We are proud and honor and respect the older members of our
committee who have spent a lifetime in the service of the working
class and who have nothing to be ashamed of,'' he said.

   About 36 million people nationwide are planning
to travel at least 100 miles away from home during the Christmas
weekend, a survey is projecting, and safety officials are urging
motorists to be extra careful.
   A national survey of 1,500 adults the U.S. Travel Data Center
conducted for the AAA-Chicago Motor Club found that 35.8 million
people _ the highest in five years _ are planning to travel during
the Christmas weekend.
   The holiday officially begins at 6 p.m. Friday and ends at 11:59
p.m. on Dec. 25. About 5.2 million people plan to travel by car,
the survey found.
   With so many motorists on the roads and highways, between 320
and 420 people could be killed in car accidents, the National
Safety Council said.
   An additional 15,000 to 19,000 people could suffer disabling
injuries, the Safety Council said.
   During the Christmas holiday season last year, 386 people died
in car accidents and about 17,900 were injured.
   Motorists are urged to avoid drinking and driving and to wear
seatbelts, said Bob O'Brien, a spokesman for the Safety Council.
   In addition, travelers should gas up their cars early because
about two-thirds of the nation's gas stations will be closed on
Christmas, AAA-Chicago said.

<TEXT>
   The wreckage of a small plane missing for
four days was found Tuesday afternoon in a rugged section of the
Catskill Mountains, authorities said. None of the six people aboard
survived.
   A state police helicopter found the wreckage at 2:15 p.m. along
a steep escarpment about 10 miles west of this city about 30 miles
south of Albany, officials said.
   An Air National Guard rescue team was dropped into the crash
site by helicopter, but found no survivors, state police Maj. Carl
Colberg said in Albany. Another team was to climb the mountains
Wednesday morning to recover the bodies, Colberg said.
   The twin-engine Piper Navajo disappeared from radar screens
Friday evening about 30 miles south of Albany while en route from
Glens Falls in the southern Adirondack Mountains to Montgomery
nearly 50 miles northwest of New York City. The plane crashed in
Catskill Park near Blackhead and Thomas Cole mountains, two peaks
more than 3,900 feet high. Radar put the plane at an altitude of
2,300 feet when it disappeared.
   Search efforts were hampered by bad weather and malfunctioning
emergency transmitter in the missing plane's tail, rescuers said.
The area where the plane disappeared has received almost 10 inches
of snow since Friday.
   Emergency transmitters are supposed to emit a signal on impact,
but searchers didn't received a signal from the downed aircraft,
said Tom Moreen, a Civil Air Patrol official in Albany.
   More than 20 aircraft searched a 5,000-square-mile area in the
Catskills and the Hudson Valley on Tuesday, said Civil Air Patrol
spokeswoman Ann MacMillan. The air patrol, state police, the state
Department of Environmental Conservation and the Army provided
aircraft for the search.
   Aboard the plane were pilot Timothy Burns, 27, of Allentown,
N.J., and five people who'd attended a business meeting in the
Glens Falls area, according to Briar Contracting spokesman Dick
Mann, whose company was owned by one of the passengers.
   Mann identified the passengers as Salvatore Arlotta Jr., 42, of
Walkill and Peter Lovi, 33, of Pine Bush, both employees of the
Wehran Engineering environmental consulting firm in Middletown;
Ronald D. Pacchiana, 56, of Pound Ridge, president of Briar
Contracting and owner of Unicorn Industries Ltd., both in
Peekskill; attorney Michael J. Trainor, 45, of New York City; and
Timothy P. Burns, 44, of Yonkers, no relation to the pilot.

   _ The two German states will negotiate a ``Treaty Community''
relationship, which would recognize the sovereignty of both nations
and facilitate closer political and economic ties.
   _ An economic cooperation agreement has been signed and a joint
committee established to determine how West German aid should be
used to help East Germany recover and boost production.
   _ The East German government will open a pedestrian crossing

Christmas.
   _ Visa-free travel for West Germans and an end to the forced
exchange of at least 25 marks ($14.50) per day will take effect on
Dec. 24, instead of Jan. 1 as announced earlier.
   _ West Germans will be allowed to change their convertible West
German marks at a rate of 1:3 for the non-convertible East marks
after Jan. 1. All official exchanges had been fixed at 1:1 to date.
   _ East Germany will work to change regulations to allow all
interested airlines to fly to West Berlin outside the Allied
prescribed corridors. Only British, French and American airlines
have been allowed to use the corridors to West Berlin's Tegel
Airport.
   _ West German credit guarantees for exports to East Germany will
be raised from 4.5 billion to 6 billion marks ($2.6 billion to $3.5
billion), to ensure delivery of goods to the economically strapped
socialist state.
   _ West Germany's contribution to the East German communications
network will be raised from 200 million to 300 million marks ($116
million to $173 million) annually, to rebuild the nation's
telephone system.

   Crews plugged a howling, high-pressure leak in
a barge loaded with 16,500 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas
Tuesday, and officials let about 2,000 evacuees return home.
   About 45 square blocks of northern Houma, including three
schools, were evacuated Monday afternoon after the barge hit a
bridge on the Intracoastal Waterway, which runs through this south
Louisiana city, and began to leak.
   There were no injuries in the accident and the bridge was not
damaged, but the leak, howling from a broken 2{-inch pipe leading
to one of four holds on the barge, was audible a mile from the
accident site.
   Jim Drone, lawyer for the barge owner, Hollywood Marine of
Houston, said the vessel carried about 16,500 barrels, or 693,000
gallons of LNG, but the amount lost won't be known until the cargo
is off-loaded at a repair yard.
   The Coast Guard closed part of the waterway to navigation until
9 a.m. Tuesay. Authorities said the barge was loaded at the Shell
refinery in Norco and was bound for Victoria, Texas, when the
accident occurred.

   Cuba has performed successful initial tests
on equipment to jam planned TV broadcasts to Cuba by the U.S.
government, the island's official news service said Tuesday.
   Granma, the official daily newspaper of the Communist
government, said the effectiveness of the interference devices
``has been partly proven.''
   The United States has been broadcasting radio transmissions to
Cuba via Radio Marti for five years. Congress backed funds for
television broadcasts earlier this year.
   In a joint statement published in Granma, Cuba's Communications
Ministry, armed forces and Radio and Television Institute said the
Cuban plan was prompted by the U.S. government's intention to put
into operation an anti-Cuban ``Television Marti'' next month,
Prensa Latina said.
   ``Faced with the Yankee threat to begin transmissions against
Cuba, larger-scale tests will be realized on national television
transmissions,'' the joint statement said.
   It said Cuban equipment would achieve ``a considerable level of
degradation of the enemy signal.''
   The U.S. transmissions constitute ``a flagrant violation of
national sovereignty and the norms and regulations for
telecommunications established by the United Nations and other
international organizations,'' the Cuban government statement said.

<TEXT>
   Two sitcom housewives, ABC's ``Roseanne'' and
Fox's Peg Bundy of ``Married ... With Children,'' stirred up things
in the Nielsen ratings for the week ended Dec. 17.
   ``Roseanne'' pushed NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' out of the top spot
for the first time since Thanksgiving. ``The Cosby Show,'' first
for the last three weeks, was third behind ``Roseanne'' and NBC's
``Cheers.''
   ABC continued its domination of the evening news. Its ``World
News Tonight'' had a rating of 11.0. CBS was second with 10.4 and
NBC was third with 10.2.
   In the season to date, ``Roseanne,'' starring Roseanne Barr, is
slightly ahead of Cosby. Each show has won six times and ``Cheers''
was ahead once.
   ``Married ... With Children'' scored its highest rating ever for
Fox Broadcasting Co. and came within striking distance of the Top
10. Its one-hour Christmas special, with guest star Sam Kinison
joining regulars Katey Sagal and Ed O'Neill, got a rating of 18.4
and ranked 13th.
   The Fox show edged out Bob Hope's Christmas show on NBC and such
favorites as ABC's ``Who's the Boss?'' and ``Coach'' and NBC's ``In
the Heat of the Night'' and ``Matlock.''
   A Fox Christmas special, ``The Simpsons,'' was 30th.
   NBC retained its wide lead for the week and for the season in
the A.C. Nielsen Co. survey. CBS took over second place from ABC,
its first time out of the cellar since the week ending Oct. 22.
Ironically, CBS claimed second place during a week it was without
an entertainment president; Jeff Sagansky's appointment was not
confirmed until Monday.
   NBC won with an average of 14.7 for the week. CBS was second
with 12.6 and ABC was third with 12.3. A ratings point represents
the percentage of the nation's 92.1 million households tuned to a
show.
   For the season to date, NBC leads with 14.9, ABC is second with
13.2 and CBS third at 12.3.
   Here is the Top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``Cheers''; NBC's
``The Cosby Show''; NBC's ``Golden Girls''; NBC'a ``A Different
World''; NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes,'' and ABC's
``Wonder Years,'' a three-way tie; NBC's ``Dear John;'' and NBC's
``L.A. Law.''
   CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' which usually is in the Top 10, was
11th for the week.
   The two-hour movie marking the return of CBS' ``Beauty and the
Beast'' was 37th and its first regular episode was 54th.
   The five bottom network shows were ABC's ``Living Dolls,'' CBS'
``Saturday Night with Connie Chung,'' ABC's ``Trans-Antarctica
Expedition,'' ABC's ``Free Spirit,'' and, in last place, ABC's
``Homeroom.''

   President Bush's nominee to head nuclear
weapons production said Tuesday that delays in a Senate
confirmation vote are undermining national security by prolonging a
leadership vacuum in the arms program.
   ``It is our country that is suffering'' as a result of Senate
inaction, Victor Stello Jr., told the Armed Services Committee at
the close of a five-hour hearing. It was the second time in five
weeks that Stello had testified to the panel.
   ``The defense nuclear facilities are in a state of disarray,''
Stello said, alluding to a series of safety and management crises
at the weapons production plants that have forced many of the key
facilities to close in recent years.
   Bush submitted Stello's nomination to the Senate on July 24 but
the first confirmation hearing was not held mid-November, when
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins personally pleaded with the
committee to approve the nomination quickly. Watkins said he needed
Stello to improve safety conditions at the arms plants.
   The department has been without a confirmed head of weapons
production for more than a year.
   The committee Tuesday heard sharply conflicting testimony about
Stello's qualifications for the job and about controversial actions
he took during his more than two decades as a staff official of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which establishes and enforces rules
on the commercial use of nuclear power.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., acting chairman of the committee, said
the panel probably would meet in closed session shortly after
Congress reconvenes in January to decide when to vote on
recommending either confirmation or rejection of the nominee.
   Fewer than half of the 20-member committee attended Tuesday's
hearing. Most panel members have not said publicly whether they
will vote for Stello, although at least three Democratic members _
Timothy Wirth of Colorado, John Glenn of Ohio and Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts _ are strongly opposed, and all nine Republican
members are expected to support the nomination.
   Of the five former members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
who testified, three strongly endorsed Stello's nomination and two
raised serious doubts about his suitability.
   John Ahearne, who was a commission member from 1978-83, said the
Energy Department ``needs somebody who is tough'' enough to force a
turnaround in the management of the nuclear weapons facilities, and
that Stello would fit the bill.
   ``Vic Stello is the first name that would come to my mind'' as a
good candidate for the job of assistant energy secretary for
defense programs, Ahearne said.
   Peter Bradford, a commission member from 1977-82, said he was
troubled by several allegations that have been made against Stello
since the time Bradford left the agency, including a charge that
Stello authorized an unusual cash payment to an informant in order
to pursue a personal vendetta within the commission.
   Bradford said this and other allegations must be ``credibly
disposed of'' by the Senate before any confirmation vote is taken.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., questioned a panel of former NRC
investigators about Stello's role in the investigations of the 1979
Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in Pennsylvania, the
worst nuclear accident in U.S. history.
   John Sinclair, a former NRC investigator and now a member of the
Commerce Department inspector general's office, said under
questioning from Gore that Stello had misled Justice Department
investigators about the existence of cooling pipe test records held
by the utility that operated the Three Mile Island reactors.
   ``That makes me think Mr. Stello was more interested in making
sure the company wasn't subject to any punishment ... than in
protecting the public safety,'' Gore said. ``I'm deeply troubled by
this testimony.''
   Sinclair and two other former NRC investigators, Jim McCarten
and David Gamble, plus Julian Greenspun, a former Justice
Department investigator, said in response to a question from Exon
that they would not recommend Stello's confirmation.
   In seeking to defend his actions following the Three Mile Island
accident, Stello tried to read from an FBI report, but Exon stopped
him, saying the report's contents could not be made public until
the FBI agreed. Exon said the panel would seek to get that approval.

   The specialists at the North
American Aerospace Defense Command here who constantly scan the
skies for enemy activity will take on additional duties here Sunday
night to watch for an old friend.
   The radar, satellites and space-age sensors of NORAD will be
watching for the unarmed, subsonic sleigh of Santa Claus.
   ``The procedure is laid down by tradition,'' said Air Force Maj.
Dick Adam of NORAD Public Affairs. ``We've been doing it for so
long it's standard operating procedure for us by now.''
   NORAD's tradition of tracking the jolly holiday visitor began in
December 1955, early in the Cold War, as it monitored the DEW
(Distant Early Warning) Line of radars set up in Greenland and
Canada.
   When Col. Harry Shoup answered the ``hotline'' in the combat
operations center one evening before Christmas, a small voice
asked, ``Is this one of Santa's helpers?''
   Shoup found that a newspaper advertisement had misprinted a
telephone number for children to call Santa, printing the defense
command's unlisted hotline number instead.
   More calls poured in and soon the center was awash in Christmas
spirit.
   An airman on duty soon drew Santa with his sleigh and reindeer
over North America on a glass ``plotting board'' used for
displaying air traffic, and another called the news media to report
an object had lifted off from the North Pole and was headed toward
North America.
   The airman reported jet fighters were being ``scrambled'' to
intercept it, and they later reported it was Santa Claus.
   Every Christmas Eve since then, NORAD has found and escorted
Santa Claus over North America.

   Nicotine, the drug inhaled by cigarette smokers,
can help reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, psychologists
reported Tuesday.
   ``Giving nicotine resulted in the patients becoming more alert,
responding more vigorously, and doing better on a variety of mental
tests,'' Reading University psychology professor David Warburton
told the London conference of the British Psychological Society.
   Research carried out at London University's Institute of
Psychiatry by Warburton's colleagues, Dr. Barbara Sahakian and
Gemma Jones, matched 39 Alzheimer's patients with a healthy group
of elderly people of the same age and intellectual ability.
   Compared with the effects of a placebo, nicotine helped the
patients suffering from premature senile dementia symptoms
associated with Alzheimer's to be more alert, the psychologists
said. However, they said nicotine did not improve their memories.
   Alzheimer's is a progressive disease characterized by
degeneration of the brain cells.
   Warburton said he would not prescribe cigarettes to his patients.
   ``My colleagues and I have never at any time recommended
patients smoke cigarettes,'' the psychologist said. ``We were
experimenting with safe ways of giving nicotine, for example
through a specially impregnated patch on the skin.''
   Warburton's report was one of 150 papers presented at the
two-day conference held at London University's Institute of
Education.

<TEXT>
   ``Roger &amp; Me,'' a documentary about the
devastating effects of General Motors Corp. layoffs in Flint,
preached to the converted Tuesday at its premiere in this
neighboring community.
   Spotlights jabbed snow-filled clouds outside the 14-screen
Showcase Cinemas in Burton, where all 14 screens showed the film
produced, directed by and starring journalist Michael Moore.
   Moore gave away many of the 4,500 premiere tickets at United
Auto Workers union Local 599, where more than 10 percent of its
15,000 members are laid off from GM jobs.
   There were boos and hisses when GM Chairman Roger Smith appeared
on the screen and cheers for UAW President Owen Bieber.
   ``Michael Moore did this town a favor; he gave us a voice in
this world,'' Phil Higgins, 33, a Chevrolet Division metal
fabricator from Flint, said as the crowd filed out.
   ``He hit it right on the head,'' said Steve Cockran, 35, laid
off after 13 years in quality control and production at GM.
   The critically acclaimed film portrays Moore's fruitless efforts
to interview Smith about the elimination of 30,000 GM jobs in Flint
and the resulting evictions and abandonment of entire neighborhoods
in the city.
   GM and city officials have countered that Flint still has 45,000
GM employees, the largest number anywhere.
   Moore said he hoped the film would stir political activism
against sweeping job cuts by a company like GM, which reported $5
billion in profits in 1988.
   ``How 'bout not closing down 10 factories and making only $3
billion?'' he said. ``Can't they be satisfied with that?''
   Moore arrived at the premiere wearing a tweed jacket, open-neck
shirt, blue jeans and sneakers and apologizing about his limousine.
``They made me ride in it,'' he said as he entered the theater
complex to address the cheering crowd.
   ``We wanted to make this film so we can show people what's
happening here,'' Moore said. ``So not only Flint, but the rest of
America would be concerned about the growing gap between rich and
poor these days.''

   Guerrillas overran a remote town, stole
$697,000 from a bank truck and battled an army patrol in separate
attacks Tuesday in rural areas, authorities said. Six people were
reported killed and three injured.
   The first attack took place in Surata, a northeastern town 280
miles from Bogota, police said. The town remained under the control
of 50 guerrillas of the pro-Cuban National Liberation Army for
several hours, according to the Santander state police.
   The guerrilla group concentrated the attack on the police
headquarters, where it killed two policemen and seized weapons and
ammunition, the report said.
   The National Liberation Army is one of the most active of more
than 10 guerrilla groups operating in the Colombian jungle.
   In the southern area of Putumayo near the border with Ecuador,
guerrillas of the Maoist Popular Liberation Army attacked a bank
truck carrying $697,000, authorities said.
   The guerrillas killed two guards, injured three others, and
seized two more before stealing the money and fleeing into the
jungle, a police report released in Bogota said.
   Earlier, an army patrol in the Santander state was ambushed by
guerrillas of the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces, said Col.
Rodolfo Herrera, commander of the Colombian Army 14th Brigade. He
told reporters that the patrol repulsed the attack and killed two
rebels.
   The patrol was searching for an armed group that killed five
emerald traders Monday and seized up to $142,000 from the victims,
Herrera said.
   In another attack, gunmen killed a councilman in Caicedonia, 150
miles west of Bogota. A police report said it was not known if the
attack was mounted by guerrillas.

<HEAD>US Soldier Shot Panamanian With Unauthorized Weapon, Pentagon Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS grafs 4-5: ``In Panama,'' with report of planes arriving
in Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. soldier used an unauthorized weapon
when he shot a Panamanian police officer Monday, the Pentagon's
spokesman said Tuesday, calling the incident ``very regrettable''
but saying it had to be considered in the context of a
deteriorating situation.
   ``What you have is a very difficult atmosphere in Panama right
now. It's very tense,'' spokesman Pete Williams told reporters.
   He said people there are afraid for their lives amid the tension
that has followed two shooting incidents in recent days.
   In Panama, according to NBC News, C-141 transports landed at
Howard Air Base at 10-minute intervals throughout the afternoon.
These planes are the kind used to carry paratroopers in what the
Army said was a readiness exercise for elements of the 82 Airborne
Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., though it could not be determined
whether the planes in fact came from Fort Bragg.
   A reporter driving through the base Tuesday evening saw at least
10 large transport planes of an undetermined type, an unusually
large number, and six to eight helicopters instead of the usual
three or four.
   At the Pentagon, Williams said that although the Army lieutenant
was in an authorized area at the time of the shooting, he was in
civilian clothes and was carrying a sidearm.
   Asked if the officer had been authorized to do so, Williams
answered: ``I don't believe he was authorized to have a weapon.''
   The spokesman said the officer was still being questioned about
the incident, and he added, ``You have to go back to the climate in
which it happened.''
   The lieutenant ``says the Panamanian reached for a weapon,'' the
spokesman said.
   At the time, U.S. forces were on alert following the fatal
Saturday shooting of Marine 1st Lt. Robert Paz, 25, of Dallas, and
the reported beating of a Navy couple who U.S. officials say
witnessed the shooting.
   President Bush has refused to rule out military action against
the government of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in response to the
Saturday shooting.
   Williams, who said the Army lieutenant was still in Panama,
blamed the incident in part on Noriega's Friday declaration of a
``state of war'' with the United States.
   ``People fear for their lives in Panama right now,'' Williams
said.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
Noriega's irresponsible declaration of a state of war last week was
followed only hours later by ``indiscriminate and unprovoked
violence against Americans clearly increases tensions in Panama.
   ``We find the unwarranted use of violence against Americans by
the Noriega regime unacceptable,'' she said.
   Williams said that U.S. forces in Panama ``are ever-vigilant.
They are acutely aware of the events that are taking place around
them.''
   He said U.S. officials are ``proceeding with caution'' as the go
about their duties, but he added: ``We remain concerned about the
situation in Panama, it appears to be deteriorating.''
   When asked about reports of preparations among the 18th Airborne
Corps, the spokesman said the unit ``periodically conducts
emergency readiness deployment exercises to evaluate the readiness
of its units. ... Currently, elements of the 18th Airborne Corps
are conducting emergency deployment readiness exercises.''
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., called on Bush to
issue an ultimatum to Noriega, telling him that continued
anti-American agitation will not be tolerated.
   ``Noriega appears to be testing the parameters of American
tolerance,'' said Lugar, a senior Republican member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee. ``We need to avoid the appearance of
acquiescence that might embolden Noriega and lead to future
American and Panamanian casualties.''
   ``There are measured options, military and otherwise, that would
inconvenience Noriega and they ought to be considered promptly in
the wake of unacceptable activities of the Panamanian defense
forces,'' Lugar said.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn, the chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations subcommittee on Western Hemisphere affairs, said
on NBC-TV that Bush was correct in avoiding talking about a
possible military response to Noriega.
   ``I think the president's handling that question appropriately.
... To not say exactly what you're going to do is probably the
right thing to do,'' Dodd said.
   The senator said that if the lives of U.S. citizens in Panama
are jeopardized, or if the canal were threatened, those two
situations ``would be two at least broad areas that would ...
warrant at least further consideration of direct military
intervention.''

<HEAD>Parliament Approves Hungarian Austerity Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament on Tuesday approved the
government's strict austerity program for next year, but wrangled
over budget cuts demanded by Western creditors and has yet to adopt
a budget.
   Negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for
hard-currency loans hinge on adoption of the budget. The loans are
needed to help transform the economy to work on market forces.
   Ernoe Kemenes, head of the National Planning Office, told the
hushed house that if it does not accept the austerity plan, within
months Hungary would be unable to finance the economy and living
standards would inevitably drop.
   The budget deficit is likely to reach $800 million this year.
The IMF wants that cut to $156 million in 1990 as a precondition to
further loans.
   A crucial $1 billion World Bank loan hinges on the IMF
agreement, as does a $1.14 billion loan from the European Community.
   Kemenes said interest payments next year on the $20 billion
foreign debt would amount to $1.5 billion. Payment on principal
would stand at $1.9 billion.
   Kemenes said in his initial report on the government program
that it foresaw cutting subsidies to loss-making companies from
$1.09 billion to $308 million.
   This would mean bankruptcy proceedings would be initiated
against 50 firms. Premier Miklos Nemeth has said that could send
the number of unemployed to about 100,000.
   The program also foresees Hungary cutting back its trade with
member countries of the Soviet-led COMECON trading bloc. Kemenes
said this would mean a cut of 20 percent in exports to these
countries, which in turn is likely to contribute to unemployment.
   He said agreement also was with the IMF on devaluing the forint.
   Finance Minister Laszlo Bekesi said last week that if parliament
rejects the budget, the government would ``have no option but to
resign.''
   A big item of controversy is the proposal to cut housing
subsidies, which now make up about 16 percent of the budget.
   The plan envisages raising rents by 50 percent as of January and
levying hefty taxes on those who enjoy low interest rates on
home-purchase loans.
   More than 20 deputies took the floor in the housing debate and
all of them rejected the government proposal, according to the
official MTI news agency.
   The deputies argued that it was unfair to place such a burden on
the population and could lead to serious political consequences, an
apparent reference to possible strikes and demonstrations.
   The house adjourned debate Tuesday and planned to vote
separately on the housing issue Wednesday before debating the
budget.
   This session of parliament is also to discuss the date for next
year's free elections _ the first multiparty elections in more than
40 years.

   Police on Tuesday disarmed a parcel bomb at the NAACP office in
Jacksonville, Fla., the fourth in a series of mail bombs that
killed an alderman in Savannah, Ga., and a federal judge in Alabama.
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in Washington that
investigators were ``concentrating on a possible racial
motivation'' for the rash of mail bombs that began Saturday. FBI
Director William Sessions said an organized group might be involved.
   Savannah officials and the FBI confirmed that the parcel bomb
that killed Alderman Robert Robinson on Monday was similar to those
that killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Judge Robert S.
Vance on Saturday and forced the evacuation Monday of the
courthouse in Atlanta that includes the 11th Circuit.
   An FBI agent said the Alabama and Georga bombs all had different
postmarks, phony return addresses and too many postage stamps.
   Elsewhere Tuesday, an anonymous caller threatened to kill a
federal judge in Alabama. A package delivered to a Birmingham,
Ala., city councilman who was a friend of Vance was found to be
harmless.
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
instructed its 1,800 branch offices and seven regional offices to
tighten security because the bombs might be racially motivated,
Executive Director Benjamin Hooks said from the organization's
headquarters in Baltimore.
   The discovery of the parcel bomb at the NAACP's Jacksonville
office prompted police to evacuate and cordon off the building.
   The bomb was disarmed inside the building with a device that
disconnected the battery from the explosive, officials said.
   ``It was designed to kill the individual that opened this
package or anyone else standing in the area,'' said Jacksonville
Sheriff Jim McMillan.
   ``It had a great similarity in the packaging to the other
bombs,'' said Willi Ellison of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms. ``It was addressed to no one specifically, but to the
legal staff of the NAACP.''
   The bomb was to be taken to an FBI laboratory in Washington and
compared with the other devices, Ellison said.
   The package arrived at the NAACP office Monday, but had been
left unopened. A series of bomb threats and scares hit federal
buildings around Florida, but no other explosive devices were found.
   Thornburgh said in a statement that he had contacted civil
rights leaders ``to assure them that we are fully committed to the
vigorous investigations of these crimes and the apprehension of the
person or persons'' who committed them.
   The FBI and Thornburgh warned civil rights leaders, judges and
attorneys that the bombings may be racist attacks, but the attorney
general stressed there was no firm conclusion on motivation.
   A pattern of racist attacks ``has to be one of the factors in
the back of all our minds,'' Sessions told a Justice Department
news conference. He said the incidents have involved ``federal
judges who have heard cases involving racial matters,'' the NAACP
and a black civil rights activist.
   Sessions said it was ``quite possible'' more than one person was
involved, and that the bombs might be the work of an organized
group. He noted that the incidents had occurred in three states in
the 11th Circuit.
   Sessions said no one had claimed responsibility for the bombs.
   Robinson, a civil rights activist and lawyer, was fatally
wounded by a mail bomb in his law office Monday, hours after the
courthouse evacuation in Atlanta.
   Although he was black, a law colleague said there was little
reason to figure him as a target of extremist bombers.
   Funeral services for Vance will be held Wednesday. U.S. Supreme
Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, who oversees the 11th Circuit, is
expected to attend, along with Sessions and the attorney general.
   FBI agent Tom Moore in Birmingham said there were ``strong
similarities'' between the three bombs.
   FBI Agent Allen Whitaker in Birmingham said the Georgia and
Alabama bombs came in similar packages but were mailed from
different places.
   ``There was not a common postmark,'' Whitaker said. ``All had
return addresses of different legitimate persons who had no
connection with the packages.''
   He said the packages bore an excessive number of postage stamps,
apparently to protect the senders from ``a face-to-face meeting
with postal employees.''
   Authorities in Alabama said the bomb that killed Vance sprayed
nails and The Atlanta Constitution reported Tuesday that the
Atlanta bomb also contained nails.
   ``We believed nails were part of this bomb also, and that has
been confirmed,'' said Savannah Mayor John Rousakis. He said he
learned from the FBI that the Savannah bomb bore a Georgia return
address, presumed to be fake.
   WAPT-TV in Jackson, Miss., reported Tuesday that it received an
anonymous letter in August declaring war on the 11th Circuit. The
letter was postmarked Aug. 21, one day a mail bomb tear-gas attack
on the NAACP's Atlanta offices.
   ``We turned it right over to the FBI,'' reporter Deanna Lee said
in a telephone interview. FBI spokesman Charles Steinmetz an
investigation into the letter began soon after the television
station had passed it along.
   Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in Atlanta, said he received a call from Thornburgh
expressing concern over the possible racial motive in the bombings.

   ``He said they were very concerned about it; there are reasons
to believe that at least part of the motivation was racial,''
Lowery said. ``We're very concerned, and I was pleased (that he
called.)''
   FBI agent William Hinshaw in Atlanta said the NAACP's southeast
regional headquarters in Atlanta has been warned that the bombs
appeared to be related to a Aug. 22 tear-gas mail bomb that
exploded there, injuring eight people.
   In Montgomery, Ala., U.S. Marshal Jim Hudson said a federal
judge received a telephone death threat early Tuesday. He would not
identify the judge.
   Police in Birmingham rushed Tuesday to investigate a package
mailed to Councilman David Herring, a longtime friend of Vance. It
turned out to be a delivery from an Atlanta business.
   Meanwhile, a government source in Washington said the bomb that
killed Vance bore the return address of Lewis F. Morgan, a senior
11th Circuit judge in Georgia. Morgan is not a suspect, the source
said, but the discovery means the killer knew a great deal about
Vance's personal habits and friendships.
   Links between Vance and Robinson are not readily apparent, other
than their moderate-to-progressive politics. Vance, who was white,
became known as a racially progressive Alabama Democratic leader
before being elevated to the federal bench, while Robinson was
known as a ``moderate, reasonable'' attorney and politician in
Savannah.
   One of Robinson's biggest cases as a lawyer did go before the
appeals court. He helped represent a black group fighting
desegregation plans by the Savannah-Chatham County schools, which
were approved by the 11th Circuit Court this fall.
   But Vance was not among the three 11th Circuit judges ruling on
the case.
   ``It was a case that we lost _ it wasn't like Robinson could
have been accused of doing anything to upset the community,'' said
Lowell Johnston, the lead attorney from the NAACP Legal Defense
Fund who worked the case with Robinson.
   Earlier this year, the Jacksonville NAACP won from the 11th
Circuit a unanimous decision reinstating school busing in
Jacksonville, overruling a lower court judge who had declared the
school system was integrated. Vance wrote the opinion in that case.
   Vance, 58, ruled in at least one other major race-related case.
The 11th Circuit in 1985 overturned a lower court's ruling and
cleared the way for prosecution of 10 Ku Klux Klansmen for a bloody
May 1979 confrontation with black civil rights marchers in Decatur,
Ala. After the ruling, all 10 defendants pleaded guilty or were
convicted.
   The 11th Circuit, based in Atlanta, handles federal appeals from
Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Authorities said the Atlanta bomb was
in a mailed package addressed to the 11th Circuit court, not to a
particular individual.

   The government had clear evidence shortly
after the first nuclear bombs were built in the 1940s that weapons
workers were being exposed to potentially dangerous amounts of
radiation, according to a congressional report.
   Despite this information, including some not previously made
public, officials overseeing the bomb factories recommended not
informing workers of the possible health risks they faced at the
secretly operated facilities, the report said.
   ``The U.S. nuclear weapons program was exposing large numbers of
workers to potentially dangerous health risks but did nothing to
warn them,'' said Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, in releasing the report
on Monday.
   The report was prepared by the majority staff of the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee, which Glenn chairs. The panel is
investigating the health research programs of the Energy
Department, which owns the 17 major facilities that design and make
nuclear arms.

   The Bush administration is telling regulators
to begin selling real estate and other assets from failed savings

instructs a document obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
   The administration, in a 91-page strategic plan, also is telling
regulators to discourage influence-peddling by keeping a public log
of all attempts by ``senior public officials'' or their staffs to

   Dan and Kathy Blackburn began taking in sick

came to love them so much they've brought all 28 home to adopt.
   ``It turned into a family and snowballed,'' Blackburn said as
the couple arrived to a rousing welcome Monday night at
Indianapolis International Airport. The Blackburns and their
children _ ages 3 to 14 _ headed for a church camp where they'll
stay in a dormitory until they find a home.
   The arrival of the Christian Evangelical missionaries and the
children culminated two years of efforts by Christian groups in
this country to bring the family to the Blackburns' home state.
   The Blackburns fled Haiti for the neighboring Dominican Republic
in 1987 during the turbulence that followed the 1986 ouster of
dictator Jean Claude Duvalier. This month, they won special holiday
parole status from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to
bring the children to the United States.

<HEAD>New CBS Programs Chief Says Escaping Nielsen Cellar Is Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jeff Sagansky, a senior program executive at NBC
when it was rising from third to first in prime time ratings,
doesn't consider a similar rise impossible for CBS, third for the
last two seasons.
   ``I think that ... CBS has got the same challenge that NBC faced
in the early '80s,'' says Sagansky, named as CBS Entertainment
president this week and now facing the considerable task of helping
it escape the Nielsen cellar.
   ``I know, having done that, that it is doable,'' he says. ``A
lot of people say, `Oh, it's impossible.' But I know that's not the
case.''
   At 37, picked from his well-paid post as president of Tri-Star
Pictures, Sagansky was NBC's vice president for series in 1983-85,
and helped develop ``Cheers,'' the top-rated ``The Cosby Show'' and
``Miami Vice.''
   In succeeding Kim LeMasters, who resigned as CBS' chief
programmer Nov. 30 after two years, he now faces ratings combat
with his former NBC boss, Brandon Tartikoff, who still is NBC
Entertainment president; with ABC; with the upstart Fox network and
with the ever-growing cable monster.
   With independent stations and videocassette players also
battling for viewers' attention, Sagansky has his work cut out. As
he notes, ``There's a lot more competition now than when NBC'' made
a comeback.
   His philosophy for dealing with it all:
   ``I think it's a case of really targeting your development for
specific time slots and having a sense of showmanship, of putting
shows on that intrigue viewers, that make a splash, that capture
their attention.
   ``The hardest thing to do now is to sort of cut through all the
media clutter with a new show.''
   Sagansky's first task will be to consider a midseason schedule,
see which new series might replace fading ones, and generally ready
CBS for the February ratings ``sweeps.''
   That's one of four key periods of intense audience measurements
each year in all TV markets. Local stations use the results to set
advertising rates.
   After sweeps preparations, Sagansky starts inspecting series
pilots and other programs, preparing for his first fall campaign.
He also has the weak-rated ``The Pat Sajak Show'' in late night to
worry about.
   Despite the task facing Sagansky, his boss, CBS Broadcast Group
President Howard Stringer, is optimistic. ``We're feeling fairly
strong now,'' he said, but he won't forecast whether Sagansky can
help CBS avoid a third season as third in prime time ratings.
   ``I don't want to put labels on it,'' he said. ``I don't want to
put pressure on Jeff. The fact is that we preach patience more than
we practice it.''
   The TV division of Columbia Pictures _ Columbia owns Tri-Star _
makes network programming, including CBS' ``Designing Women'' and
``The Famous Teddy Z.'' But Stringer said no concessions or deals
for future series were made for Sagansky to be let out of his
Tri-Star contract, which had a year to run.
   In the course of negotiations with Columbia, he said, ``all
those ... who were new to Columbia began to find out how much
business we're doing, and the more they found that out the less
difficult it became.''
   Stringer called the talks ``an amicable series of discussions.
We were in a hurry, but they didn't have to be.''
   Sagansky cheerfully admits that many of his Hollywood friends
thought he had taken leave of his senses when he agreed to become
the third CBS Entertainment president in as many years.
   ``But it was certainly the biggest challenge that I'd ever been
offered, and I didn't want to run away from it,'' he said by phone
from his CBS office in Los Angeles. ``All my friends in the movie
business said, `Don't leave,' and all my friends in the television
business said, `This is exactly the job you should be doing.' So it
was sort of split.
   ``But yes, a lot of people thought I was nuts to do it.''

   From the blue-collar housing projects
of cockney east London to the gardens of the gentry, grown men scan
the skies for hours most weekends, waiting for their pigeons to
race home.
   They rhapsodize about pigeon racing, the sport known as ``the
fancy'' and now one of Britain's more popular pastimes.
   ``All you see is a pinprick in the sky,'' said Maj. Edward
Camilleri. ``They fly toward you and you hope its yours. Then they
fold their wings, they drop out of the sky, they literally do. They
come straight down like bullets.''
   Says Bernie Bennett, who has 60 pigeons: ``Unless you're a
pigeon fancier, you just find it very hard to understand, to see a
person out in the garden, like me yesterday, bucketing down with
rain, looking for pigeons to come from 100 miles.
   ``With pigeons I find one thing and one thing only: You're the
jury, you're the prosecution, you are the judge. All that happens
down in your backyard is down to you.''
   Camilleri, a retired soldier who runs the Royal Pigeon Racing
Association, estimates Britain has more than 200,000 pigeon
breeders and racers among its 56 million people.
   Nearly 2 million pigeons, many with meticulously documented
pedigrees dating back several avian generations, are registered
with Camilleri's association alone.
   The sport has an honorable history: The ancient Egyptians kept
pigeons; Hannibal took them over the Alps; they served in both
world wars, carrying messages for the Allied intelligence forces in
Europe. Thirty-one pigeons were awarded the Dickens Medal, the
``Animal Victoria Cross,'' in World War II.
   In Britain, pigeons were traditionally associated with
beer-drinking, cloth-capped men, but it has moved upmarket in
recent years, attracting lawyers, actors and titans of industry. At
the top end of the scale, Queen Elizabeth II maintains a pigeon
loft.
   Britain's largest pigeon breeder, Louella Pigeon World, is a
high-tech enterprise that paid a world record 77,000 pounds
($120,120) in 1988 for the racing pigeon Emerald II.
   ``That, pound for pound, makes it more valuable than the Derby
winner,'' Camilleri said, referring to Britain's most prestigious
horse race.
   Emerald II is moved from one secret location to another, because
with the large sums sometimes at stake in bets and prize money,
sabotage and pigeon-napping are not unheard of.
   However, high prices don't always guarantee success, Camilleri
said, and a good racing pigeon can start as low as 20 pounds ($32).
   ``Stockmanship comes into it, knowing and understanding
pigeons,'' he explained. ``They all have their individual
characters and what you've got to do is understand their character
well enough and encourage them to come home quicker than the next
pigeon.''
   No one knows exactly how pigeons they find their way home after
being released, sometimes hundreds of miles away.
   ``The sun is definitely one (factor) and magnetic field is
definitely a second,'' Camilleri said. Research in Europe indicates
the sense of smell also may help.
   There's also a very basic urge.
   Most pigeons in Britain are kept on the ``widowhood system.'' As
soon as a hen and cock produce a pair of young, or squeakers,
they're separated. Only the males are raced, and the only time they
get to see their hens is when they return to the loft at the end of
a race.
   Each fancier's loft is registered and the distance between it
and any of the 200 official British ``liberation sites'' measured
to the nearest yard.
   Pigeons are bundled into baskets, sometimes the night before a
race, and taken to the liberation site in air-conditioned trucks.
Each wears a rubber band about the size of a wedding ring on its
leg with the details of where it came from.
   The pigeons are all released at the same time. They ascend
rapidly, quickly become oriented and head for home.
   When they land, the fancier removes the rubber band and puts it
in a timeclock that is sealed and taken to the local racing club.
The flight distance is divided by the time it took to determine who
won the race.
   What is it about pigeons that engenders such passion and loyalty?
   ``The fascination about it: you get a few pigeons, you start
winning races, and from then on it's a lot like horse racing, only
cheaper,'' Camilleri said.
   ``You can pit your wits against nature.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Edward VIII gave up his throne to marry Wallis
Simpson 53 years ago, but the romantic Windsor legend has come
alive again at their mansion in the Bois de Boulogne.
   In early December the wrought-iron gates of the final and
favorite residence of the duke and duchess of Windsor were thrown
open for a high tea given by Mohammed Al Fayed, the Egyptian tycoon
who paid more than $8 million to renovate the mansion.
   The owner of the Hotel Ritz in Paris and the Harrods department
store in London, Al Fayed plans to keep the mansion open for
friends and approved groups of visitors.
   ``Theirs was the love story of the century,'' Al Fayed said of
the Windsors. He undertook renovation with the blessing of Mayor
Jacques Chirac and the City of Paris, which is still the official
owner of the villa.
   Al Fayed said he had been shocked to see the dilapidated
condition of the villa when he visited after the duchess's death in
1986, with moldy walls and tags on the furniture and art objects
destined for the auction block.
   ``It was a sight I know would have appalled the duke and
duchess,'' he said, having seen the villa in its heyday at a dinner
party given by the duchess, the American socialite divorcee whom
the duke had married in defiance of the royal family.
   So Al Fayed took things in hand. Supervised by an Anglo-American
team of decorators, the leaky roof was repaired, the interior was
given a coat of paint, tapestries and woodwork were restored.
   Personal valuables were left in place, including framed intimate
letters and photographs and silver and crystal on the dining-room
table as if the Windsors were expecting guests. Countless porcelain
pug dogs around the house commemorate the Windsors' family pets who
always were given pride of place.
   ``I feel on top of the world,'' said Sydney Johnson, 69, the
duke's personal valet for more than 30 years, who is now
occasionally in attendance dressed splendidly in gold and red
livery as he was in the old days.
   ``I cried all through the party Mr. Al Fayed gave three years
ago to celebrate his lease on the house,'' said Johnson, a Bahamian
who was hired during World II when the duke was the governor of the
Bahamas. ``The restoration is so authentic I expect to see the
duchess stepping down the staircase asking, `How do I look?'''
   Also on hand are the Windsors' chauffeur of 20 years, Gregoire
Martin, and his wife, Maria. Martin said he had hidden 5,000
personal photographs in a bathroom to keep them from prying eyes
during the duchess's 14-year widowhood following the duke's death
in 1972.
   The house looks as if the Windsors just stepped out for a stroll
in the Bois; books are at the bedsides, brushes and combs are in
the bathrooms and some of the duchess's lingerie are tidily wrapped
in tissue in her dressing room.
   The duke's bed has its original velvet cover with his Prince of
Wales insignia and motto, ``Honi soit qui Mal y Pense,'' which
translates, roughly, as ``Shame on him who thinks evil of it.''
   By his bedside sprawls a touching little chimney-sweep rag doll
cherished by the duke, given to him by his mother, Queen Mary, who
publicly disowned him after his indiscreet marriage.
   The duchess's bedroom is a symphony of ``Wallis blue'' and cream
moire silk, with attractive imitation Louis XV and XVI furnishings
and a priceless Venetian l8th century marquetry chest. Visitors
also see a raft of stuffed pug dog dolls and framed needlepoint
works by the duke, who loved needlepoint almost as much as golf,
commemorated in souvenir golf balls all over the place.
   The duchess's bathroom is an artwork in itself, decorated by
Dimitri Bouchene, a Russian artist who designed stage sets for
Diaghilev and Pavlova.
   Under a Napoleonic-style striped silk tent ceiling, the bathroom
walls are covered with Bouchene's floral and animal murals, with a
group of his Christmas cards framed in glass lining the doors like
a gallery exhibition.
   One of the villa's first visitors was the British-born actress
Joan Collins, who asked Al Fayed if he planned to use the house for
his own parties.
   ``I will indeed,'' he said, adding that he plans to keep the
mansion staffed and open to small group visits by special request.
   In 1991, he said, he will send an exhibition of mementoes to
London and other British cities, as well as to New York and to the
duchess's birthplace, Baltimore.

<HEAD>Two Christmases _ Secular and Religious _ Coincide And Compete</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Although they happen simultaneously and go by the same name,
there are two types of Chirstmas celebrations taking place these
days _ the religious and the secular. They mingle, and also compete.
   Some people maintain the secular aspects have overshadowed the
original religious purpose to the point of threatening to displace
it, thus undermining the sometimes complementary values of both.
   ``We're in danger of losing Christmas,'' says the Rev. John F.
MacArthur Jr., pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley,
Calif.
   ``It may now be the biggest and most popular of all holidays,
but Christmas is in jeopardy just the same. A subtle but sure
erosion is eating away the season's true significance.''
   Its significance is God's incarnation in the birth of Jesus,
``God With Us,'' McArthur writes in a book of that title published
by Zondervan. He says the essential is being obscured.
   Efforts both to secularize and ``to mythologize the Christmas
story'' are robbing it of basic meaning, reducing it ``to little
more than an elaborate fable,'' he says.
   ``Most people don't know which details are biblical and which
are fabricated,'' he writes, with ``facts lost in the mythology
that has overgrown the account.''
   The story of Jesus' birth is no allegory, but is rather an event
in which ``God has given the greatest Christmas gift of all time''
_ his identification with humanity, McArthur says.
   He says secularizing influences also have eroded the real point
of the celebration, making it the ``ultimate holiday for committed
hedonists,'' with spiritual values smothered in ``crass
consumerism.''
   ``Drunken parties, self-indulgence, madcap spending and obscene
gluttony all characterize the way much of the world celebrates
Christmas,'' he says, calling for re-emphasis on worship and ``real
joy and gladness.''
   He says some secular traditions _ the decorations, family
visits, get-togethers with friends, the exchange of gifts _ ``add
to the joy of the season and they're all legitimate,'' including
Santa and his reindeer.
   But he says the real underpinning of the holiday is crumbling
under the secularizing tide, and urges commitment to revitalizing
that basic purpose.
   The Rev. James M. Wall, editor of the weekly Christian Century,
says the ``two Christmases travel on parallel tracks, but they
offer dramatically different perspectives.''
   He points out the ``secular Christmas'' draws on ``religious
imagery to evoke emotions regarding gift-giving and selflessness''
and ``memories of home and the joy of receiving gifts.''
   ``But it never acknowledges a basic contradiction in its
approach: no gift ever delivers what we long for,'' Wall says.
``What we long for is a connection to the eternal _ something no
train set or bicycle can provide.
   ``We encounter this disappointment as children, but we continue
to long for fulfillment when we hear the promises of the season.
When it is all over, if we have been locked into the mind-set of
secular Christmas, we are left with the post-Christmas depression.''
   In that sense, Wall writes editorially, Christmas ``can carry
seeds of its own destruction. Put too much reliance on finding
happiness in the event itself and you are doomed to disappointment.
   ``The celebration of a religious event for secular purposes is
bound to leave the human spirit unsatisfied.''
   Neverthless, he says, society works energetically to uphold the
secular Christmas and crowd out the religious version.
   ``The word that God became human is so absurd to the secular
mind-set that it must be greeted with an all-out defense of the
secular version of goodness and truth,'' he says.
   In responding to the ultimate mystery of God's revelation in
history, ``either we accept the gift and stand in awe that such a
thing is possible, or we vigorously deny even the possibility that
ultimacy could embrace us in such a fashion,'' Wall adds.
   ``If one is to insist that all truth is confined to the rational
mode, as the modern Western mind-set demands, then the Christmas
event must either be viewed as a quaint fable or translated into a
secular celebration.''
   But once the religious dimension fades, the grounds for goodness
are gone, Wall says, and as a Dostoevsky character warns,
``everything is permitted.'' Or to paraphrase the cynical Ebenezer
Scrooge:
   ``Christmas without a transcendent God is humbug.''

   The first Roman Catholic Mass from the Soviet
Union to be telecast in the United States will be carried Christmas
Eve by the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network.
   Jeff Weber, program vice president for the cable system, said
the service from Vilnius Cathedral in Lithuania would be presented
at 9 p.m. EST on Sunday, and repeated Christmas Day at 5 p.m.
   The Mass is to be celebrated by Archbishop Julionas
Steponovicius of Vilnius, believed to have been secretly made a
cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1979. He was allowed to resume his
church duties only a year ago.
   The 14th century Vilnius Cathedral, known as the ``cradle of
Lithuanian Christianity,'' was seized by Soviet authorities in the
1950s and converted into a secular gallery, but was returned to the
church early this year.
   VISN is operated by a consortium of 22 faith groups in the
Eastern Orthodox, Jewish, Roman Catholic and Protestant religions.

   People have an extra reason for celebrating
Christmas this year _ the end of the Cold War between West and
East, says the president of the United Methodist Council of Bishops.
   Declaring the year has seen the ``unfolding of events in the
family of nations which hold the promise of a truly better day for
humankind,'' Bishop Jack Tuell of Los Angeles said in a Christmas
message:
   ``Long-standing repressive regimes have yielded to the cries of
the people for a fuller measure of the freedom and dignity with
which God has endowed all of humanity.
   ``Groups long separated by artificail political barriers now are
coming together to form new relationships of community and
cooperation. The God who is the God of peace and justice and
freedom is surely at work in all this.''

   She's a former corporate lawyer from New York
City who confesses she likes to shock people. On the sidewalks of
Portland, Ore., Stephanie Pierce may not be shocking a lot of
people, but she's entertaining them in an unusual way. Welcome to
what she calls the world's first coin-operated art gallery.

   The 24-Hour Church of Elvis is here,
sharing space with ``the world's cheapest psychic'' and a machine
dispensing an eclectic collection of tacky prizes at a quarter a
pop.
   Put a quarter in the slot and a computer-generated voice greets
you:
   ``Hello, welcome to Where's the Art!!, the world's first 24-hour
coin-operated art gallery. What would you like?''
   Art?
   Stuffed into three storefront windows in downtown Portland,
Where's the Art!! is a repository of spinning, talking and singing
artifacts from American pop culture. Glitter, garland and
fluorescent colors abound.
   There are the Elvis Presley shrine and the ``Amazing New
See-Through Prize-o-Matic Dispenser,'' dispensing little gag prizes
of obscure value.
   ``I like to kind of shock people a little bit,'' says
owner-inventor Stephanie Pierce.
   That helps explain why her certificate of admission to the New
York Bar hangs above her toilet.
   Pierce graduated from Georgetown University Law Center in 1980
and worked as a corporate lawyer for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. in New York for three years.
   ``People think they can dismiss me as a lunatic, a member of the
far-out fringe, but then they are really so impressed by the fact
that I went to law school,'' Pierce says.
   Working on legal accounting issues just wasn't for her.
   After she handed in her letter of resignation, she says, her
boss, George Finkelstein, said, ``Stephanie, I'll see you ... on
the sidewalk begging for quarters. Good luck.''
   Finkelstein was on target. Pierce often drums up business on the
sidewalk outside her store. She cajoles people who look but don't
drop quarters in the slots.
   When the quarter plinks into one of the coin slots, the computer
talks.
   You can choose psychic counseling from ``Dr. Justin D.
Nikov-Time,'' sacraments in the Church of Elvis, fun with the Kid
Window, or a parody of the game show ``Let's Make a Deal.''
   All sorts of people come by this sidewalk arcade: college
students, tourists, street people, businessmen on lunch breaks.
Some just look. Others stop and put in quarters. They all laugh.
   ``That's one of the things I like the best _ making people
laugh,'' she says.
   Talk about participatory art. The gallery ``marries'' couples in
the Church of Elvis, replete with plastic rings and Elvis singing
``Love Me Tender.'' It conducts question-and-answer sessions with
the ``psychic counselor,'' and pushes people to ``dance with the
stars'' right there on the pavement.
   Doing a past-life regression, the computer psychic might say,
``You were a fish, you were a bird, you were Shirley MacLaine, you
were Shirley MacLaine, you were Shirley MacLaine, you were Shirley
MacLaine.''
   After answering all the questions by pushing colored buttons,
the ``patient'' receives a prize: perhaps a 3-D Psychic Calendar,
or the Handy Horoscope, which might include a prediction of an
impending restaurant deal with Reggie Jackson. Pierce makes most of
the prizes herself.
   Living in one window are a male mannequin with a
paint-by-numbers picture of a raccoon, and a female mannequin
wearing a sign that says ``Don't Hate Me Because I'm Beautiful.''
Attached to her bizarre helmet is a vacuum hose that runs up from a
contraption called the ``Bowling Channel Brain Stimulator.''
   This is art, Pierce says, not what's found in traditional
galleries. ``That's why I call it `Where's the Art!!' It's not a
question, it's a demand,'' she says.
   Pierce, 38, now revels in her place outside the art
establishment. But she did apply, three times, to Cooper Union for
the Advancement of Science and Art in New York. The art samples she
submitted included sketches of a ``Dreaminator,'' a machine that
would allow people to record their dreams and play them back.
   Pierce was rejected, but she says that's all right because not
going to art school kept her on her own track.
   ``I used to hide my strangeness all the time,'' Pierce says.
``It was really a struggle. I was trying so hard to be normal. Now
I feel like I'm myself.''
   Pierce traded in her business suits for leopard-print pants,
shorts, tie-dye shirts, and wild hair.
   She is host of a public access cable television show, also named
``Where's the Art!!'' The program, which she calls a show-and-tell
for artists and musicians, is open to anyone, and just about
anything.
   She has been making unusual pieces since childhood. She and her
brother and sister made little ``machines,'' including one that was
an early version of her current prize dispenser.
   Pierce says she made $42,000 a year as a lawyer, and piled up
the tips as a waitress. Now she struggles to keep her store afloat.
Her financial situation has improved dramatically since she began
selling ``Where's the Art!!'' T-shirts. Until then, she was five
months behind on the rent.
   Business may improve further when Pierce expands to mail-order
delivery of the T-shirts and possibly some of the prizes.
   She says she makes about $600 a month in quarters. She has to
put up with frequent leaks in her store, and duns for her
delinquent student loan payments.
   Pierce works 12 to 15 hours a day. ``But it doesn't feel like
work,'' she says. ``I'm my own boss. I don't make much money but it
doesn't matter. It's a lifestyle.''

<TEXT>
   Their many different worlds seldom intersected _ the worlds of
music and baseball, of letters and law, of the surreal and the
slapstick, of political struggle and science, of spies and
prizefights and quiet poetry.
   But together these people from many worlds helped shape our
world, for good or ill, and then they departed.
   Here, month by month, is a roll of notables who died in 1989:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>JANUARY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   EMPEROR HIROHITO, once venerated as a living god by the
Japanese, he reigned for 62 years. As the last survivor among World
War II-era leaders, he saw his nation progress from ruin to riches.
At age 87.
   BRUCE CHATWIN, British novelist and travel writer whose
obsession with nomads took him to some of the most remote places on
Earth. At age 48 of a rare disease of the bone marrow contracted on
a 1986 visit to China.

   The wind blew and the earth shook. And the wall came down.
   There it is: 1989 in review. A year of disasters that rivaled
Old Testament plagues, of triumphs that challenged credulity _ a
year that led people, again and again, to the same words: ``I never
thought I'd see the day.''
   For a while, it seemed that this would be the Year of the Oil
Spill. Then the Year of the Hurricane. Then the Year of the
Earthquake.
   But the last turbulent year of the decade will be remembered,
finally, as the year the Iron Curtain lifted.
   Twenty-six years earlier, John F. Kennedy had stood before the
Berlin Wall and said of free citizens everywhere: ``Let them come
to Berlin.'' In 1989, they came _ and from the least imaginable
direction. They came from the East.
   ``What joy!'' a West Berliner exclaimed; and people from East
and West Berlin danced and laughed and hugged atop a wall that no
longer divided them.
   ``We live in exciting times,'' President Bush observed. ``The
rapidity of change is mind-boggling.''
   Indeed it was.
   In Poland, the Solidarity trade union was illegal at the
beginning of the year; it had ousted the Communist government by
the end. Then came Hungary, East Germany, Czechoslovakia: One by
one, Eastern Europe's ruling Communist parties followed Poland's
lead and agreed to step aside and allow democratic, multi-party
elections.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had loosed the shackles
that once bound Eastern Europe. And after a seasick summit with
Bush in the tempestuous Mediterranean, he declared that the Cold
War was over.
   Images of Eastern Europe's peaceful revolution will stick in the
memory for a long time, but so will a sadder picture: a lone man
standing before a phalanx of tanks near Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   It had been a hopeful spring in the square, where tens of
thousands of students demonstrated daily to demand democratic
change. Military officers at first balked at suppressing the
protesters _ 100 officers signed a statement saying the army ``will
never shoot the people.'' But, on June 3, the army began shooting
the people.
   The death toll may never be known. Estimates ranged from 300 to
3,000. Among the victims: the hope for democratic change.
   On a smaller scale, too, it was a year of tumultuous transition.
   The TV lights went out for televangelist Jim Bakker, who got a
45-year prison term for conspiracy and fraud.
   Zsa Zsa Gabor finally starred in a film that everyone remembers
_ her trial on cop-slapping charges. She played Beverly Hills'
official court jester, and was rewarded with a conviction and jail
term.
   Leona Helmsley was the queen of a hotel empire, but she was
mocked and reviled outside her kingdom and was sentenced to four
years in prison for tax evasion.
   Pete Rose became as closely linked with betting as batting, and
agreed to a lifetime suspension from the game to which he'd devoted
his life.
   John Tower, President Bush's choice as secretary of defense,
lost the nomination and a sizable chunk of his reputation when he
was pilloried as a liquor-tippling ``party animal.''
   House Speaker Jim Wright resigned in a furor over outside
income; Tom Foley took his place.
   Time merged with Warner. Sony merged with Columbia. Mike Tyson
split with Robin Givens.
   The year's obituaries noted the passing of both famous and
infamous:
   Irving Berlin and Bette Davis, Lucille Ball, Robert Penn Warren,
Salvador Dali, Vladimir Horowitz, Herbert von Karajan, Laurence
Olivier, Mel Blanc.
   Ferdinand Marcos, Ayatollah Khomeini, Emperor Hirohito. Abbie
Hoffman. Rep. Claude Pepper.
   Sugar Ray Robinson, A. Bartlett Giamatti. Secretariat.
   Mass murderer Ted Bundy was put to death; other killers died at
their own hands. They included Patrick Purdy, who killed five
schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif.; Joseph Wesbecker, who killed
eight people in a printing plant in Louisville, Ky.; and Marc
Lepine, who systematically gunned down 14 women engineering
students in Montreal.
   Ramon Salcido allegedly killed his wife, two daughters, and four
other people near Santa Rosa, Calif., before fleeing to Mexico. He
was captured five days later and awaits trial in California.
   More than 20,000 Americans died of AIDS. Scientists continued
searching for a vaccine and a cure, and the government tried to
find new ways to make experimental drugs available more quickly.
   People worried about homelessness and hunger, abortion and child
care, flag-burning and the ``greenhouse effect.''
   The most-honored movie of the year _ ``Rain Man'' _ suggested
that the ``Me Decade'' ethic might be softening. It was the story
of a fast-talking wheeler-dealer from Southern California who found
some measure of humanity in caring for his autistic brother.
   Then again, the Grammy Award for best song went to Bobby
McFerrin's ``Don't Worry, Be Happy.''
   Historically speaking, the year began on a chilly, cloudy day in
January when George Bush took the oath of office as the 41st
president of the United States.
   ``A new breeze is blowing,'' he declared in his inaugural
address, ``and a nation refreshed by freedom stands ready to push
on: There is new ground to be broken, and new action to be taken.''
   If presidencies are defined by symbols and styles, Bush set out
to cast his as open, informal, active _ sort of an aerobic Teddy
Roosevelt. He opened the White House to the public the day after
his inauguration; he met with the press far more frequently than
did President Reagan; and he seemed at times to be cultivating an
image as the Triathlete President _ jogging, golfing, fishing,
speedboating, playing tennis, tossing horseshoes, tussling with
grandchildren.

<HEAD>Bloated USDA Office Network Needs Trimming, Says GAO Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some day, some year, Congress may get serious
about trimming the sprawling network of offices maintained by the
Agriculture Department that reaches into virtually all of the
nation's 3,150 counties.
   Various administrations and USDA analysts have been saying for
44 years that a remodeling is long overdue. The General Accounting
Office says it's time for another try.
   ``Most senior USDA officials we spoke with, and many studies
over time, recognize the need to streamline USDA, particularly its
field structure,'' says the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
   But the GAO, which is still studying how to make the department
leaner and more effective, says grassroots ties with Congress and
specific USDA agencies have ``kept the department from adjusting to
changes'' in the real world.
   The structure of USDA is formidable. There are 36 agencies in
the department that carry out policies and programs. In 1988, for
example, USDA spent more than $44 billion and employed more than
110,000 full-time people in more than 15,000 places around the
world. In addition, finances funds more than 17,000 county office
employees.
   ``Despite dramatic changes in the agribusiness sector, USDA's
basic organizational structure has changed ittle,'' the GAO said in
a recent interim report to Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
``Its agencies are tradition bound and highly resistant to change.''
   The department ``still maintains a multibillion-dollar,
1930s-designed field delivery structure, although today's farmers
are far fewer in number and operate in a global agribusiness
environment,'' it said.
   A final report by GAO is in the works and will include specific
recommendations for improving operations.
   But inefficiencies of USDA's huge administrative apparatus are
hardly news. Each year Congress has the opportunity in the
appropriations process to review costs and how they are handled.
Each year Congress hears grumbles from one group or another about
USDA bumbling in the administration of various programs.
   Additionally, as Congress is doing now, it can modify or design
new programs during the development of farm legislation. The 1985
law, for example, expires next year and lawmakers are trying to put
together a new package.
   What it boils down to, in many cases, is the fear of many rural
communities _ usually county seats _ that they may lose their USDA
offices, sometimes the biggest job source in town.
   ``Most of USDA's farm service agencies were established during
the 1930s in response to the Great Depression,'' the GAO report
said. ``In that era, communication and transportation systems
limited the geographic boundaries covered by any single field
office.''
   Because of these and other reasons, USDA established a highly
decentralized field office system to serve the large number of
small, widely dispersed, family owned farms. From 1932 to 1948,
USDA employment grew from 22,000 to 79,000.
   The GAO review included a look at a number of department
agencies, including the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service (ASCS), Farmers Home Administration (FmHA), Soil
Conservation Service (SCS) and Extension Service (ES).
   According to the review, the ASCS and SCS maintain offices in
about 85 percent of the nation's 3,150 counties; the FmHA has
offices in more than 60 percent; and the ES has them in nearly all
of the counties.
   In all, the four agencies operate approximately 10,600 county
offices. Additionally, the Federal Crop Insurance Corp. operates
through a network of government office and private insurance agents
who are ``often located close to or with one or more'' of existing
USDA field offices, the report said.
   Although GAO found many senior department officials agreeing on
the need for streamlining the delivery system for farm programs,
most thought it too difficult politically.
   ``For example, two officials, who believed the current structure
was costly and ineffective and needed to be changed, also believed
such change would be politically unpalatable and too disruptive,''
the report said.
   As early as 1945, proposals were made to streamline USDA's field
structure, the GAO said. And there have been eight major studies
the past 20 years.
   Of the various kinds of streamlining, GAO found ``collocation''
of offices under one roof _ which leaves the structure generally
intact _ to be the most successful.
   ``Collocating offices often reduces program delivery costs
through sharing equipment, technical expertise and tasks,'' the
report said. ``Program recipients also benefit by being able to
transact all their USDA business in one location.''
   In a 1985 study, the department found that ASCS, SCS, FmHA and
ES were totally collocated in 1982 in 476 counties. Not counting
ES, the agencies were collocated in 1,438 counties.
   ``However, the report stated that from 1982 to 1985, collocated
offices were separating more frequently than offices were
collocating, and that collocation did not necessarily lead to
increased cooperation among the agencies,'' the GAO said.
   Moreover, it said, USDA ``no longer tracks collocations in the
detail needed for management to determine the extent to which
counties are collocated.''

   The Bush administration, under mounting
pressure to increase the pace of its savings and loan bailout, will
tell regulators to start immediately on the huge task of selling
more than $300 billion in S&amp;L assets.
   A strategic plan developed by the Resolution Trust Corp.
Oversight Board directs regulators to begin selling real estate and
other assets even before the government officially closes the S&amp;Ls
owning the assets.
   A copy of the plan was obtained Monday by The Associated Press.

   NEW YORK (AP) _ Former stock speculator Salim B. Lewis was
spared a prison term for stock manipulation by a federal judge who
ordered him to work in a drug rehabilitation clinic, saying ``your
skills should not be wasted.''
   Lewis, a prominent Wall Street veteran whose downfall resulted
indirectly from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal, was placed
on three years of probation and fined $250,000 Monday after
pleading guilty to three counts for illegally inflating the price
of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock in May 1986.

   Marriott Corp., deciding to concentrate on its
flourishing hotel and service divisions, announced a restructuring
that calls for the sale of its weaker fast-food and family
restaurant divisions.
   The nation's largest hotel company also said Monday it would
reorganize its corporate staff, laying off an as-yet undetermined
number of workers, and buy back 10 million of its shares.
   Marriott said the restructuring would result in as much as $325
million in pre-tax charges against its fourth-quarter earnings.

   Reviving a plan to shrink operations by about a
third, Eastern Airlines told creditors it expects to sell its
prized Latin American routes and projected a net loss of $250
million for the fourth quarter.
   At a meeting Monday in New York, Eastern officials presented
major creditors with a revised business plan that takes into
account the sale of the Latin American routes.
   The plan reverts to an April proposal for restructuring Eastern
at about two-thirds its pre-strike size. With the Latin American
routes, the airline would have remained 80 percent to 90 percent of
its original size.

<HEAD>Business Week To Publish New Magazine for Wealthy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McGraw-Hill Inc.'s Business Week magazine plans
to publish a new magazine designed for wealthy people twice a year
starting in 1990, said Business Week publisher John W. Patten.
   The new magazine will be called Assets, and it will be sent for
free to 400,000 to 500,000 people, many of whom already subscribe
to Business Week, Patten said in a statement Monday. Business
Week's worldwide circulation exceeds 1 million.
   Business Week editor-in-chief Stephen B. Shepard said the new
magazine will deal with ``personal finance and executive living''
and will be about ``people and ideas as well as products and
investments.''
   The first issue will be a companion to Business Week's bonus
issue called ``Innovation'' that is to be published in June, while
the second will be published with the ``Corporate Elite'' issue of
Business Week in the fall.
   Assets will be a stand-alone magazine separate from those issues
of Business Week, but will not be available on newstands,
spokeswoman Christine Summerson said.
   In a statement, Patten said Assets ``will not just be another
magazine with fluff articles about how the other half lives.''
   ``It is for and about people who are reaching a time in life
when they are facing new challenges, both personal and financial,''
he said.

<HEAD>International Aircraft Maintenance Center to be Built in Ireland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $122 million aircraft maintenance center will be
built at Shannon Airport in Ireland by an aircraft leasing company
and two European airlines, the companies announced.
   Guinness Peat Aviation, the Ireland-based aircraft leasing firm,
will own 30 percent, while the West German airline Lufthansa and
the Swiss airline Swissair will own 35 percent each of Shannon
Aerospace Ltd., the company formed to construct, operate and own
the facility.
   Construction of the 300,000 square foot aircraft overhaul and
maintenance center will begin this spring, at the airport on
Ireland's west coast, the companies said Monday.
   The new company will start operations in late 1992 with an
initial work force of 350 which, the partners said, should rise to
1,000 by the mid-1990s.
   The facility will have two maintenance bays, one for Boeing
B737s and the other for McDonnell Douglas MD-80s. There will be an
aircraft painting hangar to accommodate the largest planes.
   ``It is planned to have two more additional bays commissioned by
1996 giving the company the ability to expand into other aircraft
types and related activities,'' the announcement said.
   At the official announcement made at Shannon Airport, Lufthansa
executive board member Jurgen Weber called his firm's expansion
into Ireland ``strategic.''
   ``Aircraft leasing is gaining in importance and we want to
develop our ability to deal with this growing segment of the
maintenance market,'' Weber said. ``The acknowledged expertise in
aircraft maintenance of Lufthansa and Swissair and GPA's
significant customer base are a first class combination and a firm
foundation for a profitable enterprise.''
   Irish Minister for Industry and Commerce Desmond O'Malley said
he hoped the new venture would be a forerunner of other projects
with European partners.
   ``Shannon Aerospace is an example of the industry we need in
Ireland, soundly based on the reputations and research of its
eminent shareholders, well funded and meticulously planned,''
O'Malley said.
   Airline analysts said the venture would help Swissair and
Lufthansa reduce their high aircraft maintenance costs.
   ``One of the problems in Europe is the shortage of aircraft
engineers,'' said Stephen Clapham, a transport analyst at Hoare
Govett. ``Labor and property, your two biggest overheads, are
higher in Germany. Shannon is not the busiest airport so the
property costs will be lower.''
   Richard Hannah, airline analyst at UBS-Phillips and Drew, said
the aircraft maintenance center will also benefit GPA Group PLC.
   ``Guinness Peat is very dominant in the aircraft leasing
business,'' Hannah said. ``This is a logical expansion for them.''
   The chairman of the board of Shannon Aerospace will be Peter
Sutherland, a former European commissioner and a director of GPA
Group.

   Marriott Corp. says it will restructure its
business to focus on its profitable hotel and service segments and
jettison its weaker fast-food and family restaurant divisions.
   The nation's largest hotel company also said Monday it would
reorganize its corporate staff and lay off an as-yet undetermined
number of workers. Marriott said the restructuring would result in
as much as $325 million in pre-tax charges against its
fourth-quarter earnings.
   The company also announced the planned repurchase of 10 million
of its shares.
   Monday's announcement marked the third time this year that a
major hotel company said it would pare its businesses to a core
group. Ramada Inc. and Holiday Corp. have already begun their
restructuring plans.
   Marriott Chairman J.W. Marriott Jr. said his company's
restaurants could not keep pace with the growth rate of its hotels
and contract services divisions. He said he hoped overall profits
would grow 15 percent to 20 percent as a result of the
restructuring.
   ``We couldn't do both,'' Marriott said at a news conference at
his company's Marquis hotel here. ``We decided to concentrate on
hotels'' and contract services.
   Opportunities for restaurant growth have been limited by
increasing competition from pizza and other fast-food chains and by
a growing tendency for Americans to eat at home, Marriott said.
   Marriott said the company, based in Washington, D.C., would
retain its restaurants at airports and on turnpikes. Those
operations would be combined with Marriott's contract services
division, which supplies hotel management and food services to
institutions and companies.
   Marriott also said his company would continue to expand its
retirement community division. It currently has 12 communities and
hopes to have 150 within five years, he said.
   ``They're getting rid of some of their worst businesses,'' said
Daniel Lee, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. ``These are
slow-growing, capital- using businesses, which had held back the
corporate growth rate.''
   Despite praise for the moves by some analysts, Marriott stock
slipped in New York Stock Exchange trading, falling $1 a share to
close at $33.62{.
   The company also announced it had completed the sale of its
airline catering division to the unit's senior managers for $570
million. That sale was expected to yield more than $200 million
after taxes, which would partially offset the costs of the
restructuring, J.W. Marriott said.
   Marriott said it would sell its 358 company-operated Roy Rogers
fast-food restaurants in the Middle Atlantic states in the first
quarter of 1990. Those stores were expected to register about $400
million in sales this year.
   Marriott also said it intends to sell the 434 units operated by
its family restaurants division, including 235 Bob's Big Boy, 79
Wag's, 31 Bickford's, 57 Howard Johnson's and 32 Allie's
restaurants. In total, these restaurants had 1989 anticipated sales
of about $440 million.
   The sale of Allie's represented a defeat for Marriott, Lee said.
The company had hoped to convert many of its other family
restaurants to Allie's but was forced to abandon the idea.
   Unlike Ramada and Holiday, Marriott does not plan major hotel
divestitures. Ramada sold its hotels and restaurants to concentrate
on its gambling operations and Holiday has sold its well-known
Holiday Inn hotels and focused on its casinos and newer hotel
chains.
   The hotel companies said they wanted to channel their resources
into their most profitable or expandable businesses.
   James Murren, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence-Morgan Grenfell,
said the slowing economy is one factor behind the restructurings.
   ``That squeezes all competitors and forces them to review their
business portfolio,'' he said.
   In addition, the hotel firms ``have broadened and diversified
away from core businesses and found those talents were not
necessarily transferable,'' Murren said.
   Sarah Sheckler, an analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago, said
of Marriott, ``At least 50 percent of their profits come from
lodging, and they're focusing on their higher growth businesses.''
   Marriott said the stock buyback would be accomplished as soon as
possible. The company said it has repurchased 32 million shares, or
24 percent, of its common stock over the past three years, leaving
104 million outstanding.
   Marriott has projected 1990 sales of $7.5 billion. In its third
quarter, the company reported earnings of $63 million, up 9 percent
from a year earlier, on revenue of $1.93 billion.
   Besides its flagship Marriott hotels, the company also owns or
operates Courtyard, Residence Inn and Fairfield Inn hotels. Its
food service operations include Host, Howard Johnson and Hot
Shoppes outlets.

<HEAD>Breeden Wants To Cut Out Squabbles Over New Products</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman
Richard C. Breeden says he'd like to see federal futures law
``repealed or modified'' to prevent interagency squabbles over new
financial products.
   Breeden used a news conference Monday on cooperation agreements
with French and Dutch securities regulators to repeat his complaint
about jurisdictional disputes with the rival Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
   Such disputes were keeping new ``hybrid'' financial products
``in the courthouse instead of in the marketplace'' while foreign
exchanges were trading in similar products, said Breeden.
   He suggested repealing or amending the Commodity Exchange Act,
which governs the futures industry, ``to let the markets decide
where the products will be most actively traded.''
   Breeden also announced he is creating an Office of International
Affairs to coordinate enforcement cooperation with foreign stock
regulators.
   The new international affairs office will be headed by Michael
D. Mann, now an associate director for international affairs in the
SEC's Enforcement Division.
   Breeden said the new office, which will be responsible for
negotiating formal cooperation agreements, known as memoranda of
understanding, ``underlines the very high priority the commission
places on international cooperation.''
   While the SEC is ``concerned a great deal about maintaining
regulatory cooperation,'' said Breeden, ``we at the commission are
also very concerned about competitive issues.''
   Hybrid products are securities with elements of commodity
futures, or futures with elements of a security. Earlier this year,
a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled the SEC overstepped its
authority when it approved trading in a type of hybrid instrument
known as an index participation, or IP.
   IPs, which have been likened to baskets of stocks, may not be
traded in U.S. markets until the dispute, which is still in the
courts, is resolved.
   Breeden first spoke out against the jurisdictional disputes to
securities lawyers last month in Washington.
   Such litigation delays are ``a direct threat to American
competitiveness'' in the financial trading markets, Breeden said
Monday. ``Our foreign competitors have not imposed this type of
restriction on themselves.''
   He cited a recent story in the Financial Times of London that a
consortium of European business people planned to offer a stock
basket product, similar to the one blocked in the United States.
   Breeden said that ``early next year we hope to work together
with the CFTC and discuss with Congress ways of moving this
unneccessary barrier to our competitiveness.''
   David Gary, a CFTC spokesman, said Monday: ``We will be meeting
and have been meeting with fellow regulators, particularly the SEC.
We feel there are a number of questions that relate to the
financial services industry. We are more than willing to sit down
and discuss them, but we want to see them answered with the big
picture in mind. Futures are not isolated by themselves.''
   Last week, Breeden signed cooperation agreements with Dutch and
French securities regulators that will allow the exchange of
information to help stamp out insider trading and other market
abuses.
   Breeden said Monday he would travel to Japan in mid-January as
part of an ongoing series of visits both countries have exchanged
since signing a limited cooperation agreement in 1986.
   Breeden, who was sworn into office in October, said he expected
the talks would cover enforcement topics as well as capital rules,
disclosure and other matters.
   On another matter, Breeden declined to discuss when he would
name a director to head the SEC's Enforcement Division.

<TEXT>
   A trade group representing savings and loan
holding companies is complaining about new rules that prohibit S&amp;Ls
from releasing mailing lists of their customers' names without
permission from their customers.
   The rules imposed by the Office of Thrift Supervision provide
that a name and address may be given out only if the customer is
first notified and does not object within 15 days. After two years,
the customer must be asked to renew the permission.
   The prohibition took effect Friday.
   The Association of Thrift Holding Companies, in a suit filed in
U.S. District Court seeking to overturn the regulations, complained
that the rules make it difficult for thrift parent companies, such
as insurance companies and banks, to cross-market their products to
the thrift's customers.
   Banks do not operate under similar restrictions and imposing the
limits on S&amp;Ls likely will hurt the government's efforts to dispose
of failed thrifts, the trade group said. Financial institutions
earn money by selling their mailing lists to others.
   However, thrift office director M. Danny Wall said in a
statement the regulation ``strikes a reasonable balance between
customers' expectations of privacy and legitimate business
interests of thrift institutions.''
   He acknowledged that in most states the rules will now be
tougher for S&amp;Ls than for banks, but said, ``We think that's a
positive step, and gives the public an incentive to place their
business with thrifts.''
   The regulation has exemptions allowing customer information to
be disclosed to regulatory officials, law enforcement officials and
credit-reporting agencies.

<TEXT>
   A panel of experts called in by a research
organization to make recommendations on U.S. trade policy failed to
reach a consensus and instead was forced to issue two separate
reports mirroring the deep divisions in the current debate over
trade issues.
   Officials of the Twentieth Century Fund said Monday it was the
first time that a panel of experts convened by the nonprofit
research organization had failed to reach enough agreement to issue
a single report.
   Instead, the panel split 7-5 with seven experts advocating free
trade and five other panel members supporting what some have called
a ``managed trade'' approach to the nation's huge trade deficits.
   The depth of feeling on both sides emerged during a sometimes
heated news conference the panel held to unveil their separate
reports.
   Those arguing for free trade asserted that the trade policies
established by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
Geneva-based organization which governs world trade, should not be
tampered with because they had served the global economy well for
almost four decades.
   ``We are the world's leading exponent of the free-market system
whose triumph we are now celebrating,'' said Herbert Stein, former
chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Nixon
administration. ``We should not retreat into fearful isolationism.''
   The minority group on the panel argued that the huge trade
deficits during the 1980s and the United States' new status as the
world's largest debtor country showed that more must be done to
attack the huge trade imbalances.
   Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department trade official in
the Reagan administration, argued that free-trade advocates were
ignoring the fact that trade to a large extent was being managed at
the present time. He said much of the Japanese success stemmed from
that government's active involvement in assisting emerging
technologies.
   ``Traditional free-traders argue that it is not important
whether your industry makes computer chips or wood chips, but we
believe that the composition of industry in a country is
important,'' said Prestowitz, now a senior associate at the
Carnegie Endowment.
   Advocates of a more aggressive trade policy argued that the
United States should establish a goal of erasing the country's
annual trade deficit by 1993. The broadest measure of trade, the
current account, was last in surplus in 1981. The deficits have
been stuck above $100 billion for the past five years.
   Stein said efforts to protect certain U.S. industries against
trade competition would end up costing consumers who must pay
higher prices for products. He said proposals for the government to
pursue an industrial policy by picking winners and losers in
emerging technologies was also ill-conceived.
   ``The notion of turning the United States economy over to a
government agency is ludicrous,'' he said.
   The members of the task force who signed the free-trade report
were Stein; Anne Krueger, economics professor at Duke University;
Lawrence J. Brainard, senior vice president at Bankers Trust Co.;
Harry L. Freeman, executive vice president, American Express Co.;
Paul Krugman, economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, Robert Z. Lawrence, senior fellow at the Brookings
Institution, and Gary Hufbauer, professor at Georgetown University.
   Joining with Prestowitz in the opposing report were Patrick D.
Choate, vice president for policy analysis at TRW Inc.; Robert
Kuttner, economics editor at ``The New Republic;'' Howard D. Samuel
with the industrial union department at the AFL-CIO, and Alan
Wolff, a Washington attorney.

   The European Community, angered by U.S.
efforts to circumvent a ban on hormone-treated beef, has asked the
United States to slash retaliatory duties imposed in the trade
dispute, an official said.
   The official said Monday that the 12-nation trading bloc wants
the tariffs reduced because of legislation requiring U.S.
commissaries in Europe to buy their beef from American _ not
European _ producers. Commissaries are stores for U.S. military and
other personnel.
   The official, who demanded anonymity, said the purchases plus
transportation costs were expected to amount to about $55 million,
which he described as an ``extra penalty'' applied by the Americans
in the dispute.
   The United States slapped duties of about $100 million on a
variety of European products to retaliate for the ban on imports of
meat from cattle treated with growth hormones. Some of the duties
have been eased slightly since the prohibition went into effect
last Jan. 1.
   Frans Andriessen, the EC's top trading official, and Ray
MacSharry, its agriculture chief, requested the tariffs be lifted
in a Dec. 1 letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills. No response has yet been
received.
   Foreign ministers of the 12 community nations discussed the
dispute at a meeting Monday and asked to be kept informed of the
American reaction, the official said.
   The banned meat affects only a tiny part of the $166 billion in
1988 trade between the trading partners.
   The community official also said the trading bloc was
considering accepting the conclusions but not critical findings of
an international trade panel that ruled in favor of the United
States in a dispute over soybean subsidies.
   The official said the community would be willing to do so
provided that the United States refrained from imposing unilateral
trade measures violating international trade rules.
   Last week, a panel of the 97-nation General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, found that community subsidies to processors and
producers of soybeans hurt trade. Details of the soybean decision
have not been released.
   U.S. soybean producers complained in December 1987 that
community subsidies had cut into American exports to Europe. The
American Soybean Association argued that the payments encouraged
farmers to grow oilseeds, which then reduced the demand for
American imports.
   The community argued the erosion of the European market was
largely due to increases in cheaper imports from Brazil and
Argentina.

   Eastern Airlines has revived a plan to shrink
its operations by about a third, telling creditors it expects to
sell its valuable Latin American routes.
   At a meeting with major creditors Monday in New York, Eastern
officials also projected a net loss of $250 million for the fourth
quarter. They presented creditors with a revised business plan that
takes into account the sale of the Latin American routes.
   The plan reverts to an April proposal for restructuring Eastern
at about two-thirds its pre-strike size. With the Latin American
routes, the airline would have remained at 80 percent to 90 percent
of its original size.
   The sale of the routes is being negotiated, but no deal has been
struck with the potential buyer, rival American Airlines.
   ``We are in intense negotiations with Eastern but a deal has not
yet been completed,'' said Al Becker, a spokesman for American at
its headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas. He refused to elaborate.
   According to a report Monday in The Wall Street Journal, Eastern
tentatively agreed over the weekend to sell the Latin American
routes and other assets to American for $450 million to $500
million.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak declined to comment on the
Journal report. Eastern has not named American, the nation's
largest carrier, as the interested party.
   The New York Times reported today that Eastern agreed to sell
the routes to American for almost $350 million.
   In another sign of its ambition to expand, American announced
separately Monday an agreement to buy from Trans World Airlines its
Chicago-to-London route and four gates at Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport for $195 million.
   Miami-based Eastern has been working on a reorganization plan
since filing for bankruptcy court protection March 9, five days
after being crippled by a strike. Sales of other assets totaling
about $688 million already have been approved by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland.
   Negotiations with American, which has coveted the Latin American
routes for its expansion plans, stalled in August. Eastern
initiated new talks about two months ago, amid concerns about cash
shortfalls in its rebuilding plan.
   Eastern has delayed presenting a new reorganization plan to
creditors while the negotiations have continued. The airline hopes
to emerge from Chapter 11 early next year.
   If Eastern can sell the routes, ``It puts the reorganization
plan back on schedule,'' said Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst at
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   The officials also told creditors that Eastern will be ``an
airline in transition'' between January and June of next year. In
addition to selling the Latin American routes, they said, Eastern
will continue to build up Atlanta as its hub and ``de-hub'' Miami,
to reduce Caribbean operations, and to retire its 14 Lockheed
L-1011s.
   Eastern expects to post a fourth-quarter net loss of $250
million, widened from a loss of $185.2 million in the third
quarter, said the officials, led by President Phil Bakes. Next
year, the carrier expects to turn a ``modest'' net profit in the
second half and a net loss for 1990 of $90 million.
   The improvement in the second half will result from refocusing
on the Atlanta hub, reducing expenses and expanding revenue, the
officials said.
   The sale of the Latin American routes was envisioned in
Eastern's original business plan presented to creditors last April.
The idea was scrapped in a later plan after talks with American
stalled.
   The Journal report Monday, citing unidentified sources, said
American would get Eastern's South American and Caribbean routes,
plus gates and landing sites at various airports. American also
would obtain some other assets of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
including Continental Airlines' Miami-London route, the report said.
   The Journal reported that the weekend agreement came about after
Continental agreed to settle a long-standing lawsuit against AMR
Corp., American's parent. That suit sought as much as $1 billion in
damages and alleged that American's computer reservations system
gave American an unfair advantage.
   The Times, citing an unidentified source, said Continental would
agree not to bring another suit over its contention that American's
reservation system, which is used by travel agents, favors American
flights over those of other carriers.
   The sale of international routes must receive government
approval, as well as that of the bankruptcy court.
   Also at the meeting Monday, the officials told creditors that
Eastern will ask Lifland for an extension of the Dec. 29 deadline
for submitting its revised reorganization plan. The judge already
has given the airline several such extensions.

<HEAD>Stock Speculator Sentenced To Work in New York Drug Clinic</HEAD>

   A light sentence of three years probation for
admitted stock manipulator Salim B. ``Sandy'' Lewis is another sign
that on Wall Street it pays to settle.
   Lewis pleaded guilty to three counts of securities violations
rather than face trial and was sentenced Monday to work in a New
York drug rehabilitation clinic and pay a $250,000 fine rather than
go to prison.
   Some securities law experts said the term appeared fair for
Lewis' crime _ jacking up the price of Fireman's Fund Corp. stock
in May 1986 _ but raised the question of whether white-collar
felons were being treated too leniently.
   In her sentencing speech, U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe
told Lewis that ``your skills should not be wasted in warehousing
you.'' She also said his admission of guilt was a mitigating factor.
   ``Where you run into problems is the kid who sells a little
marijuana or cocaine and gets three years,'' said Alan Bromberg, a
securities law professor at Southern Methodist University. ``I'm
not sure he's doing any more social harm. It's just that he's not
capable of doing as much social good.''
   Lewis was ordered to work 40 hours a week for one year at Daytop
Village, a Manhattan-based drug rehabilitation clinic. He must work
20 hours a week at the clinic in the second and third years of his
probation. Lewis will work at Daytop as an executive consultant;
the idea to work there was his.
   Boyd L. Jefferies, the former Los Angeles stockbroker who
identified Lewis as part of a plea deal in which he cooperated with
the government, in July was sentenced to five years probation and
community service and fined $250,000.
   Two other figures in the Wall Street scandals still await
sentencing after pleading guilty to securities crimes: former
takeover strategist Martin Siegel and former stock arbitrager
Robert Freeman.
   Observers said the Lewis case could bear on sentencing GAF Corp.
Vice Chairman James T. Sherwin, who was convicted last week of
stock manipulation in a case also before Lowe. Sherwin has done
extensive work for a refugee relocation agency, as Lewis had worked
with drug-addiction agencies and the poor.
   Lewis, 50, a prominent Wall Street veteran, had faced up to 15
years in prison and a $750,000 fine. His firm, S.B. Lewis &amp; Co.,
was fined $400,000 for violating federal securities laws.
   The stock manipulation raised the value of Fireman's Fund stock
immediately before a longtime Lewis client, American Express Co.,
sold a large amount of shares in a new public offering.
   American Express _ which invested $4 million to help Lewis start
his brokerage in 1980 _ was never charged, and there is no proof
that it or Lewis profited from the manipulation. But under federal
securities laws, profit isn't necessary to commit a crime.
   Lewis maintained he was not motivated by greed but by a desire
to punish rival speculators attempting to bid down the price of
Fireman's Fund in anticipation of the new stock offering. The
government disagreed.
   ``Lewis' attempts to portray himself as a misguided watchdog of
the markets are simply not supported by the facts, which show
instead a straightforward market manipulation designed to assist a
close business associate, American Express,'' prosecutors said in
court papers.
   Columbia University securities law professor John C. Coffee Jr.
said Lewis' contention that no one was harmed in the manipulation
was misplaced.
   ``People were buying these securities as a price that was
inflated and artificial,'' he said.
   Prosecutors alleged that at Lewis' request, Jefferies bought
more than 400,000 shares of Fireman's Fund on May 8, 1986,
successfully driving its price up 12{ cents to $38 a share.
   A day later, American Express announced it would sell 8 million
shares of its 41 percent-owned Fireman's Fund at $41.50 a share, a
new stock offering that had been widely expected.
   Prosecutors said American Express made $88 million from the sale
but they never offered evidence that any of that profit was tainted
by what Lewis did.

<HEAD>TWA To Sell Chicago Holdings To American, Icahn Says Other Sales
Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By R.B. FALLSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines Inc. pilots are calling a
planned $195 million sale of assets to American Airlines the first
step in a liquidation.
   TWA Chairman Carl Icahn warned that other asset sales are
possible after Monday's announcement that the airline had agreed to
sell to American its Chicago-London route, a maintenance hangar and
four gates at O'Hare International Airport.
   Icahn, in a letter to TWA employees, said the deal was designed
to help restore TWA to profitability and give the company extra
cash in case of a protracted slump.
   Leaders of the TWA branch of the Air Line Pilots Association
blasted the deal, saying it would further alter the balance of
power in the industry. Kent Scott, chairman of the union's
executive council in St. Louis, TWA's hub city, said the pilots
would try to block the deal, which requires government approval.
   ``There is no possible way that TWA can get stronger if it gets
smaller,'' Scott said. ``We think that this is just a first step in
a controlled liquidation of TWA.
   ``In our view, this is not just an isolated sale of a route that
doesn't fit into the TWA route system, as Carl Icahn would like to
portray it,'' he said.
   Analyst Paul Turk, who follows the industry for Avmark Inc.,
agreed with the pilots.
   ``Any diminution of TWA's overseas operation is probably not a
good sign _ not for the long-term health of the airline,'' Turk
said.
   A spokeswoman for the Independent Federation of Flight
Attendants said her union also opposed the sale.
   ``We would be very disappointed to lose the routes,'' said Joan
Wages, a legislative representative in Washington, D.C. ``I'm sure
that the Department of Transportation will look very closely at
this.''
   Icahn, who has been rumored to be seeking buyers for the
airline, did not identify which assets may be sold. TWA spokesman
Don Morrison declined to elaborate.
   ``It is clear that TWA can no longer afford to make investment
decisions based on traditional thinking,'' Icahn said. ``There are
unprofitable assets at TWA which have been untouched purely because
of `tradition.' These assets, if sold, could put us on the road to
profitability.''
   Icahn, saying only three or four major airlines will exist by
the mid-1990s, said he would use TWA's cash to expand
internationally, including applying for permission to fly to Tokyo
from St. Louis.
   But he said TWA was not having financial difficulty.
   ``TWA currently has over $700 million in cash, and I hope within
the next several months to have well over $1 billion,'' Icahn
wrote, saying TWA's investments added $500 million to the airline's
books in realized and unrealized gains.
   ``This cash reserve will help protect TWA from the economic
downturn that I have been predicting and that is already occurring
in our industry,'' Icahn said.
   Icahn, a billionaire corporate investor, was TWA's ``white
knight'' in 1986, buying the airline in a $440 million deal to
thwart an attempted takeover by Frank Lorenzo's Texas Air Corp.
TWA, based in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., is the nation's eighth-largest
carrier.
   The sale gives American, the No. 1 carrier, a second London
route. The airline, a unit of AMR Corp., has flown to London from
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport since 1982.
   The deal leaves TWA with three gates in Chicago, Morrison said.
The transaction is dependent upon TWA losing enough money this year
to negate clauses in its agreements with its pilots union.
   David Berkley, a spokesman for the pilots, said the intent of
the agreements were to give Icahn a chance to sell assets only as a
last-ditch effort to save the company.
   ``What we didn't foresee was the methodology Icahn used to take
the company private,'' Berkley said. ``Privatization is directly
responsible for the losses in the air. He put so much debt on TWA
and extracted so much cash that it negatively affected operations.''
   While American was buying the TWA holdings, an expected
announcement on a multimillion-dollar expansion into Latin America
did not materialize. Published reports said American would by
Eastern Airlines' Caribbean routes Monday, but no deal was
announced.
   During the past year, American has worked on expanding its
international business, adding European and Pacific Rim flights.

   Year-end holidays will be longer than usual for
107,700 autoworkers as manufacturers try to bring production in
line with slowing demand.
   That news came Monday as Ford Motor Co. joined Chrysler Corp. in
a new round of buyer incentives and Federal Reserve Board member
Martha Seger warned that the auto and housing industry slumps could
push the U.S. economy into recession.
   A check with the Big Three automakers Monday found that most
layoffs at 35 of the 54 assembly plants belonging to General Motors
Corp., Ford and Chrysler will be during the first two weeks of next
month.
   Auto plants will be shut down next week for the usual Christmas
holiday, but that will being extended at many of the plants.
   GM said it was suspending production at 22 of its 30 car and
truck assembly plants next month, each for at least two weeks,
affecting about 75,000 workers. Ford said it was closing 11 of its
16 assembly plants for a week or two apiece, affecting about 25,400
workers.
   Chrysler previously announced that two of its eight plants would
be idled for two-week periods in January, involving 7,300 workers.
That could change later in the week when the company's January
production figures firm up, spokesman Doug Nicoll said.
   While some of the moves by the Big Three had been reported
earlier, the latest announcements gave a clearer indication of the
size of the cutbacks.
   ``It's obviously symptomatic of current demand in the industry,
which is very low,'' said auto analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. in New York.
   While GM, Ford and Chrysler carve deeply into their January
production, the five Japanese-based automakers assembling vehicles
in the United States plan normal production next month.
   In fact, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. said Monday it was beginning
production at its second car plant in the United States.
   Laughlin and other auto analysts have predicted for months that
production levels in the first quarter of 1990 would be sharply
curtailed. During the second half of 1989, automakers continued
ambitious production schedules despite waning demand.
   Inventories rose and companies started and stopped incentives to
shrink the backlog. As the 1990 model year officially started Oct.
1, inventories began to shrink. Lately, they have been swelling
again.
   Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly newsletter of the auto
industry, reported earlier this month that as of Nov. 30, dealers
had an 88 selling-day supply of new cars on hand.
   In other words, if the current selling pace continued and no
more cars were received from factories, the supply wouldn't dry up
for nearly three months.
   Recent 10-day sales reports from dealers have found cars and
trucks made by the Big Three selling at a pace far slower than
during the corresponding periods a year ago. Early December car
sales by dealers for the Big Three, for instance, were 29.7 percent
lower than they were during the same time last year.
   Sales of trucks, which have gained popularity in recent years,
were running 15.6 percent behind last year's pace during the early
December period.
   ``If sales don't recover in the next month it's going to be a
much larger problem,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan Stanley
&amp; Co. of New York,
   Seger, in Monday's edition of the trade journal Automotove News,
said the slumping auto and housing industries made a recession in
the overall economy a real threat.
   ``I think we're very vulnerable and very much at risk,'' Seger
said. ``I have a growth forecast for next year that is just barely
anything, just enough so you can write it in black ink.''
   Merlis said he expects the Federal Reserve Board to take action
soon to stimulate the economy because of the drop in car and truck
sales during the fourth quarter.
   ``The Fed has got to come to the rescue of the auto industry,''
he said.
   Meanwhile, Ford said Monday it was offering up to $1,000 on all
1989 and 1990 Aerostar minivans, matching incentives announced last
week by Chrysler.
   On Friday, Chrysler for the first time began offering rebates on
its popular minivans, the Dodge Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and
Chrysler Town and Country. General Motors Corp. hasn't said whether
it will offer similar incentives for its minivans.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Orders Sale of Failed S&amp;Ls' Assets</HEAD>

   The Bush administration is telling regulators
to begin selling real estate and other assets from failed savings
and loans even before the government officially closes the
institutions.
   Regulators ``should ... immediately begin shrinking such
institutions' balance sheets in a coordinated and orderly manner,''
instructs a document obtained Monday by The Associated Press.
   The administration, in a 91-page strategic plan, also is telling
regulators to discourage influence-peddling by keeping a public log
of all attempts by ``senior public officials'' or their staffs to
influence their decisions.
   The plan, scheduled for release by the end of the year, was
prepared by the Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board, an
administration panel headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady. The board sets policy for the Resolution Trust Corp., a new
entity run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an independent
regulatory agency.
   Under pressure from critics to increase the pace of its savings
and loan bailout, the administration plan outlines its approach to
the huge task of selling more than $300 billion in S&amp;L assets.
   As of Dec. 8, the RTC had control of 280 failed S&amp;Ls, having
disposed of 33 since its creation Aug. 9. It expects to get
jurisdiction of at least another 220 insolvent thrifts in the next
2{ years.
   Most of the 33 S&amp;L resolutions so far have involved transferring
the deposits of the failed institution to a healthy bank or S&amp;L,
leaving the government with the thrifts' bad loans and repossessed
real estate.
   Critics say unless the RTC starts selling S&amp;L assets soon, the
properties will deteriorate, driving up the taxpayer cost of the
bailout.
   Earlier this month, the Shadow Financial Regulatory Committee, a
group of university professors and other private analysts, warned
that if the RTC continued on its present course, it could soon
exhaust its available cash.
   The oversight board is directing the RTC to develop a national
program to sell S&amp;L assets even before the institutions are closed
or sold to new investors. As part of that, it suggested packaging
and selling mortgage loans owned by the thrifts.
   The plan also:
   _Gives the RTC a June 30 deadline to finish reviewing the
bailout deals put together by its predecessor, the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp.
   _Tells the agency to ``provide financing of (real estate) assets
sparingly and only when necessary.'' The financing should be
considered a concession and be reflected in a higher purchase price
for the property, it said. Without such financing _ in effect a
government loan _ some analysts contend the agency won't be able to
sell many properties.
   _Says failed S&amp;Ls deteriorating at the fastest rate should be
closed first, but says the agency shouldn't waste time developing a
precise priority schedule.
   _Allows the RTC to sell a minority-owned thrift to another
minority institution without opening the sale to non-minority
bidders. It permits the agency to finance the sale, at market
rates, for as long as nine months. In most cases, the RTC is
forbidden from keeping an interest in institutions it sells for
longer than six months.
   _Orders the agency to make public all documents spelling out the
terms of bailout deals, including the estimated cost to the
government and the economic assumptions underlying the estimate.
   Despite its length, the plan leaves a number of important issues
unresolved. For example, it tells the RTC to ``develop a
mechanism'' to raise additional funds to finance S&amp;L bailouts until
it can sell thrift assets. However, it gives the agency no guidance
on the politically charged question of whether the additional funds
should be added to the federal budget deficit.
   It also gives the RTC wide latitude in deciding how to sell
insolvent S&amp;Ls, including selling the whole institution with good
and bad assets, selling only the good assets and marketing the bad
assets separately, keeping all the assets for later sale, and
dismantling the thrift and selling it branch by branch.

   Residents of the nation's midsection may be
cursing the frigid weather, but some travel agents are praying for
more to boost business during the peak Christmas and New Year's
season.
   ``Snow and cold is a godsend to travel agents,'' said Cliff
Stern, president of Windy City Travel Inc. in Chicago. ``The phones
ring off the hook.''
   Airlines are helping the spur-of-the-moment travelers by lifting
advance-purchase requirements on discount tickets.
   But some industry observers said Monday the breaks from airlines
are a sign of a weak holiday travel season.
   ``Anytime you get a real sharp cold snap it often triggers
vacation destination ticket sales,'' said Stephen Dexter, an
airline industry analyst with Kemper Financial Services Inc. in
Chicago.
   ``What makes it abnormal this time around is the cold snap is
happening during a holiday season and the tickets are still
available. That should not happen,'' Dexter said.
   ``Typically people who decide suddenly that they are going to
escape the cold have to pay a pretty steep price. There are still
bargains out there for the last-minute guy.''
   Strong bookings for January through March indicate people are
postponing discretionary travel, said Susan Storb, general manager
of the vacation division for Rosenbluth Travel Agency Inc., in
Philadelphia.
   ``I just think it's just not as strong as it's been over the
past few years,'' she said of the holiday season.
   A number of airlines, under pressure to increase fares because
of recent cost increases, said earlier this month that they were
raising the prices on their popular deeply discounted fares,
commonly known as MaxSavers.
   But many airlines also announced they would waive the 14-day
advance-purchase requirement between Dec. 20 and Jan. 5, subject to
seat availability.
   There are restrictions: no refunds are allowed, and passengers
must buy tickets within 24 hours of making a reservation and must
stay over a Saturday night.
   But Stern and Dexter said airlines are adding discounted seats
that can be purchased on short notice and are close to the cost of
the MaxSavers.
   The record low temperatures are encouraging a trend toward
shorter, less planned vacations, said Greg DeClemente, vice
president for leisure travel at Thomas Cook Travel in New York.
   ``People are saying, `Hey, it's 7 degrees in Chicago, let's get
out of here for a few days,'' DeClemente said.
   Temperatures Monday morning were below zero in the Upper Plains,
in the teens in the Rockies and in the 20s along the Texas
Panhandle.
   Record low temperatures, ranging from minus 3 degrees to minus
10 degrees, were recorded over the weekend in Cleveland, Columbus,
Ohio, Elkins, W.Va., Paducah, Ky., and Indianapolis, Ind.
   Last-minute customers want to go ``anywhere that's warm and they
don't seem to care where,'' Stern said.
   ``They'll even settle for the sixties in Florida as opposed to
zero here.''
   In Los Angeles, where people don't have to flee the balmy
weather, the travel business is holding its own for the holiday
period, said Susan Kaplan, president of the Southern California
chapter of the American Society of Travel Agents.
   A general feeling that the economy is on a ``normal'' course may
be contributing to a slight increase in travel bookings, Ms. Kaplan
said.
   Things are not as rosy for some hotels in California.
   Fred Gholi, manager of the Sunset Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles,
said he doesn't expect to be more than 70 percent full during the
holidays.
   ``Compared with last year, it's terrible,'' he said.

<HEAD>Manville to Speed Up Payment to Asbestos Victims' Trust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manville Corp. says it will accelerate payment
of a $50 million note to the asbestos victims' trust fund created
by its bankruptcy reorganization, according to the Manville
Personal Injury Settlement Trust.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Monday, the Trust said it had been exploring ways to improve
liquidity after a plan for Manville to repurchase $500 million of
its preferred stock fell through earlier this month.
   ``One of those alternatives is an offer by Manville to
accelerate the payment of its $50 million Trust note,'' the SEC
filing said.
   The note was to be repaid in two equal payments on Sept. 15 1990
and the same date a year later.
   ``The Trust and Manville have agreed in principle that Manville
will pay the $50 million principal amount of the note together with
accumulated interest of approximately $8 million to the trust on or
about Dec. 28, 1989,'' the three-page filing with the SEC said.
   Spokespersons for both Denver-based Manville and the Washington,
D.C.-based trust confirmed that an agreement in principle had been
reached.
   ``Manville and the trust anticipate that discussions will
continue, from time to time, regarding mutually acceptable methods
for improving the trust's financial flexibility and enhancing value
for all shareholders,'' the SEC filing said.
   In October, Manville _ a forest products and construction
materials concern _ offered to purchase about $500 million of its
preferred stock from the trust at market prices. On Dec. 7,
however, both the trust and Manville announced that plan had been
withdrawn because of a failure to agree on details of the agreement.
   Both Manville and the Trust said they anticipated future
discussions ``regarding mutually acceptable methods for improving
the trust's financial flexibility and enhancing value for all
shareholders.''
   The trust was created as part of Manville's bankruptcy
reorganization in the late 1980s after a wave of health claims over
asbestos-related diseases forced the company to seek protection
from creditors under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy law.
   The trust was created on Nov. 28, 1988, the same day Manville
emerged from reorganization proceedings.
   Since then, the trust has settled more than 15,000 personal
injury cases, paying out more than $600 million to injured victims.
   The trust owns 50 percent, 24 million shares, of Manville's new
common stock as well as convertible preferred stock and a $1.8
billion bond.
   Beginning in 1992, the trust will receive 20 percent of
Manville's net profits, under the terms of the agreement that
created the trust.

<HEAD>Sears Drops Tiegs, Loosens Ties to Disney</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. and Cheryl Tiegs are
parting ways after 10 years, but analysts say the split should
cause no pain to the world's largest retailer.
   Chicago-based Sears also says it has loosened its marketing ties
to Walt Disney Co.
   ``It has always been a mystery to me why retailers have been
under the illusion that puting a celebrity's name on a line
enhances its value,'' said analyst Edward Weller of Montgomery
Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   ``I think image, over the course of years, has become less
important than substance,'' he said.
   That's exactly what Sears is hoping as it continues its
transformation from old-line retailer into a nationwide chain of
stores featuring superstore-like ``power centers'' and everyday low
pricing.
   Dropping the Cheryl Tiegs line of women's sportswear, a private
label carried by Sears since 1980, reflects a commitment by the
retailer to offer more name-brand goods, said Sears spokeswoman
Mary Jean Houde.
   ``Recent trends in women's apparel have indicated a preference
for national-brand merchandise and less demand for celebrity
lines,'' she said Monday.
   Ms. Houde said the decision to discontinue the relationship with
Ms. Tiegs was by mutual agreement.
   In an interview with Crain's Chicago Business, a local business
weekly, Ms. Tiegs said Sears was no longer interested in promoting
the Cheryl Tiegs line.
   ``When we started the program, there was a lot of advertising,
enthusiasm and backing,'' she said. ``Now, there's no advertising
support for female apparel. It's gotten lost in the shuffle.''
   But analyst Walter Loeb said Sears was better off without Ms.
Tiegs.
   ``I think she was a person for the '80s,'' said Loeb of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. in New York. ``Sears is moving with the times.''
   Sears also has apparel marketing agreements with actress
Stephanie Powers, tennis player Yvonne Goolagong and golfer Arnold
Palmer.
   The company announced earlier this year it was phasing out its
men's dresswear department, which includes a line of Johnny
Carson-label clothes.
   Ms. Houde said Sears' affiliation with Palmer and Ms. Powers
would continue, at least until their contracts expire. She said she
did not know the status of Sears' affiliation with Ms. Goolagong.
   Ms. Houde also said Sears and Disney had modified a 10-year
marketing agreement signed with much fanfare in 1987. The new pact
sharply curtails Sears' rights to market Disney-character products.
   Under the old agreement, Sears would have obtained exclusive
rights to develop products using characters from re-released and
new Disney animated films. The deal also called for Sears to
sponsor a major attraction at the new MGM-Disney theme park in
Orlando, Fla.
   Under the revised deal, which was struck last February, Sears
has rights to sell new Disney merchandise on a case-by-case basis
and maintains exclusive rights until 1991 of about 250 characters
from classic Disney films and to certain Disney-themed products
Sears has developed.
   Disney spokesman Tom Deegan said Monday the old agreement was
``confining,'' especially since Disney has been rapidly expanding
its own retail outlets in the past year.
   Deegan said there will be 41 Disney stores, carrying only
Disney-character merchandise, by the end of this year, with 100
planned by 1992.
   Last March, Sears began a changeover to everyday low pricing, a
retailing strategy that includes more brand names, lower prices and
fewer temporary price-cutting sales.
   The move was designed to fight discount chains and specialty
superstores, which have been steadily eroding Sears' market share.
   But after an initial surge, Sears' same-store sales growth has
been sluggish.

<HEAD>Inland to Sell 13 Percent Stake to Nippon Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inland Steel Industries Inc. has announced plans
to sell a 13 percent stake to Nippon Steel Corp. of Japan for $185
million.
   The proposed transaction was announced after the close of
trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange and involves the sale
of 185,000 shares of a newly issued preferred stock for $1,000 a
share.
   Chicago-based Inland will spend proceeds from the sale to buy
back its common stock on the open market within a year, said
company spokesman Sam Saran.
   Inland also agreed to place a mutually acceptable designee of
Nippon Steel on its board of directors. Nippon agreed it would not
acquire additional Inland shares for 10 years without Inland's
approval.
   Nippon paid $15 million for 1 percent of Inland's common stock
earlier this year, and the new transaction would raise Nippon's
stake to 14 percent.
   The transaction will ``strengthen the company's long-term
competitive position in the steel industry through an expanded
strategic partnership with Nippon Steel,'' Inland Chairman Frank
Luerssen said in a statement.
   In addition, it will provide significant benefits to
stockholders, he said.
   Saran called the development ``another strategic move involving
the close collaborative relationship between our two companies.''
He said the announcement was not an antitakeover defense.
   In a statement from Tokyo, Nippon Steel President Hiroshi Saito
said: ``With the growth of global manufacturing enterprises, strong
international relationships are increasingly important to assure
our steel customers' needs in North America.''
   In 1986, the two firms agreed to build a $400 million continuous
cold-rolling mill in New Carlisle, Ind. The mill, which uses
Nippon's technology for manufacturing sheet steel for the
automotive industry, is to begin operation next year.

   The electric cords that dangle from the
fronts of cars on the northern Plains are an oddity to strangers
but a lifeline to residents.
   The cords run to engine heaters that help cars start on brutally
cold mornings. Folks on the Plains have been known to call the
device's inventor, Andrew Freeman, a saint.
   ``I had a guy come up to me in a store the other day and thank
me for inventing the heater,'' the 80-year-old Freeman said Monday.
``He said he never would have gotten his car started that day
without it. I get a kick out of things like that.''
   Strangers to the region point to the heater cords showing
through the grillwork and ask whether they belong to electric cars.
   But Mark Ewens, a National Weather Service forecaster in Fargo,
said the heaters have become necessary equipment in North Dakota
and other Midwestern states.
   ``We all have them, we all use them,'' Ewens said. ``When the
air temperature is 33 degrees below zero when you get off work at 7
a.m., there's no way you'd get the car started if you didn't have
it plugged in.''
   Freeman, a North Dakota native who lives in Grand Forks, created
his first heater out of necessity. He got a patent on the device in
1947.
   Tired of being unable to start his car in the winter, he devised
a heater that consisted of a brass cylinder about the size of a
finger. It contained a heating element attached to the end of a
bolt.
   The bolt replaced one of the headbolts in the engine and the
cylinder, with the heating element extended into the engine water
jacket. A cord attached to the top of the bolt plugged into an
electrical outlet.
   As cars changed, Freeman invented two other heaters _ a frost
plug heater that attached to the side of the engine and an external
tank heater.
   Drivers who want to make certain their cars start simply can go
to a service station and have an engine heater installed for
roughly $50. Its cord is plugged into an outlet at night, and the
car is warm and ready to go in the morning.
   Freeman's invention should get plenty of use in the coming days.
The temperature is not expected to climb above zero for the rest of
the week.
   Ewens said December's cold weather is not that unusual.
   ``I think people have really poor meterological memories,'' he
said Monday. ``We've just had a few years of really mild winters.
Now we're back to normal.''
   And despite the cold, Freeman gets a warm twinge of pride when
he sees all those cars with heater cords.
   ``You walk around town and you see a lot of cars with plugs
hanging out of them, and you realize you're the guy who got that
started.''

   Housing starts fell 4.7 percent in November
after rising 13 percent a month earlier, the government reported
today.
   The Commerce Department said new homes and apartments were built
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.36 million units last
month, down from a revised 1.43 million units in October.
   The October increase was the largest since December 1986. Starts
had fallen 4.9 percent in September.
   The report was fresh evidence of the sluggishness in the housing
industry. Construction has been one of the economic sectors slowed
by high interest rates resulting from the Federal Reserve's grip on
credit as it strives to curtail inflation.
   In addition to its effect on construction jobs and the building
materials industries, the housing industry has an impact on other,
related industries, such as home appliances and furnishings.
   Interest rates ranged from 9.82 percent to 9.74 percent in
November, according to surveys by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp. Total housing starts during the first 11 months of the year
were down 6.5 percent from the same period of 1988.
   Construction of single-family homes in November dropped 0.9
percent to an annual rate of 1.02 million units. Single-family
starts had risen 5.5 percent in October.
   Apartment construction fell 14.4 percent in November to an
annual rate of 346,000 units after jumping 37.9 percent in October.
It had fallen 13.6 percent in September.
   The South had the steepest decline, down 11.3 percent to 495,000
units after rising 14.8 percent in October. Starts in the West also
fell, down 5.3 percent to 375,000 units.
   Starts increased 3.7 percent to 305,000 units in the Midwest and
3.3 percent to 295,000 units in the Northeast.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, edged down 1.7 percent after rising 2.8 percent in
October.

<HEAD>Nissan's Exports Expected to Rise 0.2 Percent Next Year</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Co. expects exports to rise 0.2
percent next year but overseas production to increase by 7 percent,
officials of Japan's second biggest automaker said Tuesday.
   Exports are expected to reach 1.07 million vehicles with
overseas production totaling 683,000 vehicles, Nissan Managing
Director Kiyofumi Morimoto told a news conference.
   Domestic production is likely to rise 3 percent to 2.44 million
vehicles, while domestic sales will increase 4 percent to 1.37
million, Morimoto said.
   He said Nissan's increased output will not contribute to trade
friction with the United States or other trading partners ``because
there will be a gradual shift to production overseas at the expense
of domestic production.''
   By 1992, he said, Nissan expects overseas production to rise to
1 million cars and trucks, and domestic production to stand at some
2.5 million vehicles, including 1 million exports, making half of
all Nissans sold overseas manufactured in Japan.
   Projected domestic sales by 1992 of 1.5 million vehicles are in
line with Nissan's effort to capture 30 percent of Japan's domestic
market, Morimoto said.
   Currently Nissan's market share is 23.8 percent, but the
automaker hopes to gain 1 percentage point a year for the next
several years, he said.
   Nissan also will consolidate its operations in North America
from next year under a new umbrella company, Morimoto said.
   Nissan North America Inc. will oversee research and development,
sales, finance and other operations in the U.S. market, and
coordinate the activities of Nissan's 10 U.S. subsidiaries.
   ``The establishment of NNA in the United States will give Nissan
a tripolar corporate management structure, with integrated
operations headquarters in Japan, North America and Europe,''
Nissan President Yutaka Kume said in a statement. ``We decided to
establish NNA in order to promote the growth of our U.S. operations
as truly American firms.''
   ``The authority to make decisions will be gradually transferred
from Tokyo to this company,'' Morimoto said. ``They will have more
and more responsibility for making decisions for our business
activities in the United States such as model lineups and
marketing.''
   Capitalized at $2 million and based in Los Angeles, Nissan North
America will be established Jan. 1 with 30 staff members, and grow
to some 100 in a few years, Morimoto said.
   The firm's president will be Yoshikazu Hanawa, currently a
Nissan managing director and chairman of Nissan Motor Corp. USA,
Morimoto said.
   The automaker considered naming an American to head its U.S.
operations but decided on Hanawa because ``the main job is
coordinating Nissan subsidiaries, the central player is obviously
going to be Nissan Tokyo,'' Morimoto said. ``One who is most versed
in this is a Japanese (who) is the best choice for this company.''
   He said he expected an American would eventually take over the
job, although he did not say when.

   The stock market declined broadly today amid
lingering worries about the future course of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 56.10 points in

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .47 to 189.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.52 at 369.34.
   On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 42.02 to
2,697.53, for its biggest single-day loss since it dropped 47.34

   Big Board volume came to an estimated 187 million shares,

   Consumer prices rose a moderate 0.4 percent in
November as higher food and heating costs more than offset cheaper
gasoline, the government said today.
   The seasonally adjusted increase in the Labor Department's
Consumer Price Index, which translated into an annual inflation
rate of 4.9 percent, followed a brisk 0.5 percent rise in October
and relatively modest hikes from June through September.
   The price spurt was slightly higher than many analysts had been
expecting. The government blamed the rise on a jump in natural gas
and electricity costs and an increase in prices at supermarket
checkout counters for beef, eggs, fresh vegetables and dairy
products.
   Through the first 11 months of this year, consumer prices have
risen at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, up only slightly from the
4.4 percent price gains in both 1988 and 1987.
   However, the year-to-date figure masks a roller-coaster ride
that saw prices rising at a 6.7 percent annual rate for the first
five months of the year, moderating through the summer and then
returning to about average for the past two months.
   The November inflation number, a notch above the 0.3 percent
rise anticipated by many analysts, dampened hopes in financial
markets that the Federal Reserve Board would lower interest rates
this week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.50 to
2,696.03 in the first half hour of trading.
   Meanwhile, the Labor Department said in a separate report that
Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation,
fell 0.7 percent last month following a 0.6 percent rise in October.
   In another economic report, the Commerce Department said housing
starts fell 4.7 percent in November, reversing a 13 percent jump a
month earlier. New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 1.36 million units last month, down from a
revised 1.43 million units in October.
   Leading the November advance in consumer inflation was a 0.6
percent boost in food prices, the steepest since May. Dairy
products jumped 1.7 percent, the third consecutive sharp increase.
The price of fruits and vegetables soared 1.8 percent, the second
big gain in a row.
   Economists are attributing the dairy price hikes to last year's
drought, which caused many farmers to slaughter milk cows.
   Gasoline prices fell 2.1 percent in November following a 0.9
percent rise in October. However, other forms of energy were more
expensive. The index for natural gas and electricity rose 1.5
percent, while fuel oil edged up 0.2 percent following a big 2.5
percent gain a month earlier.
   Overall, energy prices fell 0.1 percent last month. Prices
excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, a measure
considered a better gauge of underlying inflationary pressures,
were up 0.4 percent following a 0.5 percent gain in October.
   The cost of medical care, which has been increasing at an 8.5
percent rate over the past year, was up 0.8 percent in November, in
line with previous increases.
   Clothing costs edged up 0.1 percent in November, following two
months of steep increases that coincided with the introduction of
fall lines.
   In other areas, new-car prices rose 0.8 percent, tobacco was
down 0.1 percent and entertainment costs climbed 0.2 percent.
   Before taking into account normal seasonal changes, the Consumer
Price Index stood at 125.9 in November. That meant that a
hypothetical selection of goods and services costing $100 in the
1982-84 base period would have cost $125.90 last month, up from
$120.30 a year ago.
   The Bush administration is predicting an improvement in consumer
inflation next year to the 4.1 percent range, not far below the
projections of most economists.
   However, private analysts generally don't share the
administration's optimistic belief that inflation will continue to
decline in 1991 and beyond. They predict the Federal Reserve Board,
which influences economic growth by its control of interest rates
and the money supply, won't engineer the sustained period of
sluggishness necessary to flatten wage increases.
   Analysts attribute the most recent spate of dampened price
activity in part to the central bank's year-long campaign, ended
last spring, of pushing interest rates higher. Since then, the Fed
has sought to avoid a recession by allowing rates to decline.
   ``We don't think the Fed really has the strength of will to
reach its zero inflation goal,'' said Cynthia Latta, an economist
with DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   The 5.4 percent unemployment rate in November, she said, matched
the rate at the start of the year and was not appreciably above the
15-year low of 5 percent, reached in March.
   ``Services are 55 percent of the (consumer index) ... and I
don't think there's been very much easing in the labor market,''
she said. ``The pressure is still toward larger wage increases.''
   Last week, the Labor Department said its index for wholesale
prices, which does not include services, declined by 0.1 percent in
November.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most grain and soybean futures prices drifted
lower in light early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading volume was thin and activity slow, typical for a
pre-holiday period.
   ``The main characteristic of the market today is its quiet, dull
trade _ it's directionless,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a floor
trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Rainfall overnight in Brazil, the world's second-largest soybean
producer, kept pressure on soybean futures prices.
   Traders seemed to ignore the continuing frigid weather in the
Great Plains and Midwest, which helped commodity prices last week.
   The Agriculture Department's rejection of wheat export bids from
Morocco and Egypt added another bearish factor while indications
that India is in the market for palm oil were perceived as helpful
to the soybean oil market.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.14} a
bushel; corn was { cent to } cent lower with December at $2.34 a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with December at $1.40
a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 1{ cents lower with January at
$5.79} a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .32 cent lower to .18 cent higher with December
at 78.45 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .23 cent lower to .08
cent higher with January at 84.40 cents a pound; live hog futures
were .10 cent to .35 cent lower with December at 53.10 cents a

February at 51.65 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Monday while pork futures

   The stock market showed a broad loss again today

<HEAD>United Technologies Gives to Thai Charity As It Seeks Engine Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Technologies Corp., vying for more
than $100 million in jet-engine orders from Thailand's national
airline, has donated $500,000 to a charity run by the Thai royal
family, a newspaper reported today.
   UTC officials called the donation to typhoon victims
humanitarian and said they often give money to victims of natural
disasters, but some industry experts said the contribution appeared
to be an attempt to curry favor with a potentially big customer,
The Hartford Courant reported in a copyright story.
   ``They didn't give that out of the goodness of their heart,''
said retired Navy Rear Adm. Gene R. LaRocque, director of the
Center for Defense Information, a Washington watchdog group.
   Thai officials in Washington said UTC's contribution to the
typhoon relief fund was the largest they were aware of.
   The contribution was given to Thailand's ambassador to the
United States during a private ceremony Dec. 5 at his Washington
residence, U.S. and Thai government officials and an aide to UTC
consultant Alexander M. Haig Jr. confirmed Monday.
   Haig, former U.S. secretary of state and a former UTC president,
approved UTC's contribution to victims of Typhoon Gay in his role
as head of the corporations Pacific advisory committee.
   The typhoon ravaged southern Thailand in November, killing
nearly 500 people and leaving thousands homeless.
   Sales to Thailand of UTC products, ranging from Pratt &amp; Whitney
engines and Sikorsky helicopters to Otis elevators, have grown
seven-fold in the past five years, to $69.1 million in 1988.
   Last summer, Thai Airways International canceled a $65 million
engine supplier, Fairfield-based General Electric Co., and switched
the order to Pratt &amp; Whitney. The order was for engines on three
Airbus A300 wide-bodied jets.
   Pratt and GE are now competing for as much as $120 million in
Thai Airways engine orders, expected to be announced early next
year. Those engines would power at least six A300s and one Boeing
747 being added to the airline's fleet.
   UTC spokesman Dan Harrison said Monday there were no conditions
attached to his company's donation.
   ``Thailand is an important country to us,'' Harrison said. ``But
the contribution was made for humanitarian reasons.''
   Harrision said UTC officials felt the amount of money was
``appropriate given the magnitude of the typhoon.'' He said the
giant aerospace and industrial concern also contributed to relief
efforts for victims of Hurricane Hugo and the earthquakes in San
Francisco and Armenia, but he said he didn't know how much it gave.
   The U.S. goverment donated $75,000 to the typhoon victims, the
Thai embassy said. GE did not contribute, spokesman Dwight Weber
said.
   UTC wanted to keep its donation quiet and ``didn't want any
publicity,'' said Promjit Boon-Lang, an information officer at the
Thai embassy.
   Franklin J. Parisi, UTC vice president for communications, said
the corporation makes donations ``all the time that we don't
announce.''
   LaRocque said the contribution, while legal, has an
``unpleasant, malodorus smell to it.''
   Industry analysts said UTC's contribution reflects its
recognition of the way business is done in many foreign countries.
   ``Business is done any way you can do it in Asia, any way you
can get it done,'' said Mark A. Bobbi, an analyst with Forecast
International in Newtown, Conn.

<HEAD>Shakeout In The Automotive Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's car market is so suffused with
lookalike brands and models that competition increasingly will be
forced into pricing, says a professor who has studied the market
for three decades.
   He forecasts competitive pricing over the next few years ``like
we've never seen before'' with potentially severe damage to
products lines and even to entire manufacturing operations.
   ``There'll be a shakeout,'' says Professor Eugene Jennings of
Michigan State University, an adviser to top corporate executives
and an observer of the automotive industry whose opinions are
widely sought.
   ``We go into the 1990s with homogenization of design and style
clear across the board,'' said Jennings, who earlier attributed
some of General Motors' lost market share to a lack of
distinctiveness among its own brands.
   Now, he says, sameness pervades the whole industry to such an
extent that product differences are even too subtle for
advertising, being observable only after salesmen call attention to
them in the showroom.
   But getting buyers into the showrooms, particularly for cars
with little ``curb appeal,'' is more difficult than ever, Jennings
says, especially after two years in which sales were kept strong by
drawing from future markets.
   He says it is unlikely that any one manufacturer intended it
this way, but that they reacted in similar conservative ways to a
fear of overcapacity in the industry, rather than risk losing share
through unacceptable innovations.
   ``The consequences were too great if they guessed wrong,'' said
Jennings in an interview. ``New concepts would have presented too
much risk.'' And yet, he suggested, it might take the assumption of
such risk to make a breakthrough.
   The rare market situation already is reflected in advertising
where, he says, more and more money is spent simply to ``break
through the clutter and confusion,'' and images and themes
substitute for product distinctiveness.
   ``It's almost as if automobiles have become a commodity,'' said
Jennings, a business professor and author of many books about the
inner workings of corporations.
   The pricing problem could hardly be more serious, he says,
observing that prices are following the same conservative trend,
``a bit above or below the category average _ and be prepared to
make a deal.''
   While the sameness syndrome exists, he says, it will be
difficult for many car lines to sustain premium prices, since
customers can easily switch to the ``same'' car made by a different
manufacturer.
   Planning and development also are affected by the syndrome. Big
spending in this area always has been risky, if necessary, since a
new concept or radical style change might not be accepted.
   The failure of Ford's Edsel is a monument to that risk, and more
recently, says Jennings, photographs of General Motors' Saturn car,
a costly effort to rethink the entire production process, were
greeted by yawns.
   In the current market, where sales already have been
``borrowed'' from model years to come, and with large overcapacity
in manufacturing operations, the risk is magnified. ``No one can
afford to have an Edsel,'' says Jennings.
   While assumption of that risk might eventually be the only way
to dissolve the stalemate, Jennings feels for the time being
companies most likely will fight their battle on the pricing front.
   ``Prices will not hold at premium levels,'' he states.

   The dollar ended higher Tuesday against major
foreign currencies in light trading in Europe.
   Gold prices also rose.
   The dollar got a lift early in the day on speculation that the

at 3.75 percent.
   Those rumors, which were denied by Japanese authorities, and
profit-taking in the West German mark combined to lift the dollar,
market watchers said.
   The rumors of a Japanese rate hike helped rekindle sentiment
that an interest-rate rise will eventually be needed to shore up

   But dealers said trading was calm.

   The Trump Shuttle, the northeast airline service
named after the billionaire developer who bought it six months ago,
has reached a collective bargaining agreement with the pilots union.
   The 4-year agreement, which must be ratified by the rank and
file, provides for improvements in wages, benefits and work rules,
the airline said Tuesday. Trump Shuttle spokeswoman Joan Fudala
declined to give any details.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that it will be ratified,''
Les Robinson, head of the pilots union at the airline, said in a
telephone interview. He also declined to disclose details of the
tentative agreement.
   Ray Grebey, the shuttle's chief labor negotiator, said in a
statement the new agreement ``recognizes the unique nature of
hourly shuttle operations''.
   Most of the 225 pilots at Trump Shuttle, which links New York
with Boston and Washington, formerly worked for Eastern Airlines.
Wealthy property developer Donald Trump bought the shuttle service
from Miami-based Eastern for $365 million in early June.
   ``We are not any longer working for a have-not airline,''
Robinson said. Calling the brief contract negotiations ``a real
love-in,'' he said they were markedly different from the ``Eastern
tradition'' of adversarial relations between employees and
management.
   The Trump Shuttle pilots are members of the Air Line Pilots
Association, one of three unions that struck Eastern last March,
forcing it to seek bankruptcy court reorganization. The Eastern
pilots and flight attendants halted their strikes shortly before
Thanksgiving, but the Machinists union is continuing its walkout.
   Contract negotiations covering the 280 flight attendants at
Trump Shuttle are due to start in the first quarter of next year,
Ms. Fudala said. Talks with the Machinists union have been
postponed pending a challenge from a rival group, the Aircraft
Mechanics Fraternal Association, which is seeking to represent
mechanics at the shuttle.

   Wheat futures prices rose modestly Tuesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that China was seeking to buy
410,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat. Corn closed mixed and soybean
futures finished lower.
   The talk of Chinese interest in wheat was rooted in active
buying of wheat futures by commercial grain dealers known to do
business with China.
   The corn and soybean markets drifted mostly lower on
light-volume trading characteristic of pre-holiday sessions.
   ``It was a very quiet, dull session,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a
floor trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   All contracts for December deliveries expired at noon. December
wheat went off the board 4 cents lower at $4.11 a bushel, December
corn was 1 cent lower at $2.33{ a bushel and December oats were 2
cents lower at $1.40 a bushel. There was no December soybean
contract.
   At the close, wheat was } cent to 2{ cents higher with the

<HEAD>Toy Manufacturer Looks to Increase Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With just a few days left before Christmas, at
least one toy manufacturer's thoughts have turned from sales to
safety.
   Peter Reynolds, president of Milwaukee toymaker Brio USA, is
taking advantage of the season to amplify his call for stronger
regulation in the $12.5 billion-a-year toy industry.
   Reynolds, whose company is best known for its wooden train sets,
wants the Consumer Product Safety Commission to shift from
voluntary to mandatory safety standards.
   ``The toy industry as a whole has a pretty good record,''
Reynolds said in an interview. ``But, obviously, one death or one
injury is too many. To me, the big problem with safety is that the
law does not require any manufacturer to test any toy.''
   He said the commission's voluntary standards allow too many
hazards to slip through its safety net.
   But others in the industry, including several charged with the
duty of ensuring toy safety, say Reynolds' concerns are overblown.
   David Miller, president of Toy Manufacturers of America, said
the voluntary standards the industry uses are some of the ``most
comprehensive in the world.''
   ``We're usually complaining that we're over-regulated and that
they mettle too much in how we do our business,'' Miller said.
   In 1988, the commission logged 142,000 toy-related injuries for
children of all ages. Between January 1988 and September 1989 it
received reports of 34 toy-related deaths, spokeswoman Anne Pavlich
said.
   Most large manufacturers _ including Brio, whose parent company
is based in Sweden _ already test their toys for safety. The vast
majority of injuries and deaths are caused by the toys of smaller
companies and imports, Reynolds claimed.
   ``The major manufacturers would probably question my sanity in
doing this,'' he said. ``What I'm doing is I'm voicing an opinion
and hopefully someone will hear it.''
   Ms. Pavlich said the commission receives complaints both for too
much interference and not enough regulation.
   ``We're damned if we do, damned if we don't,'' she said. ``There
are people telling us that they want us to do more, and others
telling us that we're doing too much.''
   The commission's activities include monitoring injuries and
deaths through reports from hospital emergency rooms and other
sources; recalling hazardous toys through reports from its
investigators, consumers and the manufacturers themselves; and
working with the U.S. Customs Service to prevent imports of illegal
toys, she said.
   The commission and Miller's association work together with the
Philadelphia-based American Society for Testing and Materials to
develop the voluntary safety standards for toys.
   ASTM is a 90-year-old organization with 32,000 members who
represent manufacturers, consumers and other interests, said
Patricia Downey, public relations manager. The members make up 135
committees that develop standards, she said.
   ``The important thing about our standards is that they're not
mandatory,'' Ms. Downey said. ``The main premise is that there be a
balance between the producer and the user.''
   The commission is represented on the consumer products committee
to make sure the testing standards for toys ``meet the consumer's
needs,'' Ms. Pavlich said.
   If the commission were to decide that the requirements were
insufficient, it could establish mandatory requirements, she said.
   Miller said his association, which represents manufacturers
accounting for 90 percent of U.S. toy sales, works with the society
and regularly reviews testing requirements.
   Miller said those voluntary requirements and the commission's
other efforts are enough to keep the market safe.
   ``I find it amusing to be defending them, but the people who are
picking on them know very little about toy safety,'' Miller said.
   Toy experts also agree that much of toy safety depends on
parents, who must buy the right toys for their children and make
sure they're used properly.
   Reynolds said parents often ignore age labels, and by doing that
put their children in danger.
   ``If it says for 3 years old and up and you give it to a
10-month-old, it could be potentially dangerous,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S., Soviet Accounting Venture Launched</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   American numbers crunchers are the latest
capitalists to exploit the budding U.S.-Soviet business romance.
   Ernst &amp; Young, a leading U.S. accounting and professional
services company, said Tuesday it had signed an agreement with
Vneshconsult, the Soviet management consulting firm, creating what
was described as the first Western-Soviet accounting company, based
in Moscow.
   The American partners will provide training in their worldwide
audit methodology for Vneshaudit's Soviet personnel, Ernst &amp; Young
said in a news release.
   ``There is no public accounting profession in the Soviet Union
since there has been, until recently, no need for one,'' said James
Searing, Ernst &amp; Young's director for international business
services.
   ``Concepts such as the Western understanding of profit
measurement and the differences between external and internal
auditing and reporting are new for them,'' Searing said. ``Setting
up business there requires far more than just adapting one
country's accounting standards to another's.''
   Ray Groves, co-chief executive of Ernst &amp; Young, said the firm's
entry into the Soviet market ``is both a tangible symbol of the new
cooperation and a highly practical advance movement for American
commerce.''
   A number of highly visible American companies have been signing
business deals and exploring opportunities in the Soviet Union
because of the liberalization encouraged by President Mikhail
Gorbachev, who is trying to revitalize his nation's stagnant
economy and reduce the state's role.
   U.S. ventures now range from importing Soviet watches to
building the world's largest McDonald's restaurant in Moscow.
   Ernst &amp; Young, one of the largest accounting firms in the world,
was established by the merger of Arthur Young and Ernst &amp; Whinney
earlier this year. The company has offices in more than 100
countries.

   Subway Sandwiches and Salads, a fast-growing
chain of restaurants specializing in submarine sandwiches, was the
top-ranked North American franchise in 1989 for the third
consecutive year, according to Entrepreneur magazine.
   The magazine, which publishes it 11th annual franchise rankings
in its January issue appearing newstands on Dec. 28, said Tuesday
that eight of the top 10 franchises were in the fast-food category.
   ``It demonstrates the American emphasis on convenience,'' Rieva
Lesonsky, editor of the Irvine, Calif.-based magazine, said in a
telephone interview.
   Second was Domino's Pizza Inc., based in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
followed by McDonald's Corp. of Oak Brook, Ill.; Little Caesar's
Pizza, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., and Burger King Corp.,
based in Miami.
   The magazine compiles its rankings by using a number of factors,
including number of years in franchising, number of franchised
versus company-owned units, startup costs and growth rate.
   Ms. Lesonsky said Subway, which is based in Milford, Conn., has
grown to 3,610 franchised restuarants in 1989 from 1,375 in 1987.
   The restaurant's appeal, she said, is that it serves ``fast
food, but it's healthy and Americans are a little more tuned in to
health these days.''
   Rounding out the top 10 are Dairy Queen, Minneapolis; Arby's
Inc., Atlanta; Chem-Dry Carpet, Drapery &amp; Upholstery Cleaning,
Cameron Park, Calif.; Hardee's, Rocky Mount, N.C.; and Century 21
Real Estate Corp., Irvine, Calif.

   Blue chips steadied, but the rest of the stock
market continued to slump today amid persistent worries about the
future course of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 56.10 points in
the past two sessions, recovered 3.20 to 2,700.73 by 3 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 2 to 1, however, in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
501 up, 1,000 down and 477 unchanged.
   Analysts said the latest economic reports from the government
hadn't done much to pull the market out of its recent slide,
induced to a great extent by worries about the real estate market
and mortgage debt.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.4 percent in November, or at an annual rate of 4.9 percent. That
appeared to put a new obstacle before any fresh moves by the
Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Separate government figures showed a 4.7 percent decline in
housing starts last month.
   Brokers said that left stocks in the grip of recession fears and
of talk that a slump in business conditions might be exacerbated by
a weak market for homes and other real-estate properties.
   A few recently depressed mortgage and regional banking stocks

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It wasn't quite Lindbergh, but a Texas university
professor earned his footnote in aviation history Tuesday when he
completed the first trans-Atlantic flight in an ethanol-fueled
airplane.
   Max Shauck, a mathematics instructor at Baylor University in
Waco, Texas, landed at the small Toussus-le-Noble airport southwest
of Paris after a one-hour flight from Tours.
   He set out with Italian co-pilot Grazia Zanin from Waco on Sept.
15 in a light experimental aircraft that carried them through often
rough weather to Canada, the Azores, Portugal, Spain and finally
France.
   ``We feel we have proved that ethanol is a very reliable fuel,''
Shauck said. ``You can't get across the Atlantic on an unreliable
fuel.''
   Proving the merits of the relatively cheap, non-polluting
ethanol compared to standard fuel drove Shauck make the journey,
which he funded himself at more cost ``than I care to think about.''
   Ethanol is essentially an alcohol fuel made from vegetable
matter, usually corn in the United States and sugar beets in
Europe. Shauck, who also does air pollution research at Baylor,
says ethanol retails for about $1.20 per gallon in the United
States compared to $1.80 for high-octane aviation fuel.
   ``It produces more power, it burns cooler and there's a lot less
pollution,'' he said. ``But we had to go out of our way sometimes
to find it.''
   Indeed, Shauck and Zanin's flight log includes a hodgepodge of
small stopovers in North America chosen chiefly because ethanol
could be delivered there.
   These included Paducah, Ky.; Newark, Ohio; Hazelton, Pa.; and
Suffolk, N.Y. The plane also stopped at Shauck's hometown of
Mansfield, Ohio.
   In Canada, they stopped at Moncton and St. Pierre-et-Miquelon
before lifting off from St. John's, Newfoundland on Oct. 20 for
Flores in the Azore Islands, a 2,000-mile crossing made terrifying
by rain and thunderstorms.
   ``It's a long way over a lot of water when you're flying a
little plane looking for little islands,'' he said. ``We didn't
have sophisticated navigation equipment.''
   They waited in the Azores for nearly three weeks for a shipment
of ethanol to arrive before flying to Lisbon Nov. 10. Shauck, 54,
and Ms. Zanin, 33, made stops in Bilbao, Spain, and Bordeaux,
Rochet-Sur-Yon and Tours in France.
   Technically, they became the first people to cross the Atlantic
in an ethanol-fueled plane the minute they touched down in
Portugal, but the original plan they filed with American
authorities was from Suffolk County, N.Y., airport to Paris.
   The fiberglass aircraft, a sort of flying wing built by the
Velocity Corp. of Sebastian, Fla., featured elevators, normally
found on the tail, at the front of the airplane and a propellor
mounted on the back.
   The whole contraption weighs about 2,100 pounds and can reach a
top speed of 200 mph.
   Shauck resists comparison with American aviator Charles
Lindbergh, first man to cross the Atlantic in a flight from New
York to Le Bourget airport in Paris on May 31, 1927.
   ``He is a hero,'' Shauck said. ``Everything now is different
than it was in his day. I avoided going to Le Bourget because I
didn't want to be compared to him.''
   Shauck said he would take a commercial flight back to Texas, but
that the aircraft will make one more trip _ to Ms. Zanin's
hometown, Trieste.

<HEAD>Miller Launches $2 Million `Think When You Drink' Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYA L. WESLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller Brewing Co. will add a new medium this
week to its effort to teach consumers to drink responsibly when the
beermaker begins a $2 million television advertising campaign for
the holidays.
   The company has used the slogan ``Think When You Drink'' as a
tag line in its print advertisements and in taverns and liquor
stores, but this year's campaign will be the first time Miller has
used the slogan in a television campaign, spokeswoman Elizabeth
Conlisk said.
   ``We looked for a long time for the right tone and the right
message,'' Ms. Conlisk said. ``When we did it, we wanted to do it
right.''
   The television commercials were to start Thursday and run
through Dec. 31 and will have a ``warm and cozy feeling to them,''
Ms. Conlisk said.
   Rather than focusing on the problems irresponsible drinking can
cause, the commercials feature traditional American taverns.
   ``Taverns are places where people have gone for years to have
and beer and be with their friends,'' Ms. Conlisk said. ``These
commercials make people feel good about that.''
   The commercials include the message:
   ``The next time it's Miller Time for you, we'd like to ask you
to do one very simple thing. Be responsible. Think when you drink.''
   Milwaukee-based Miller, the No. 2. U.S. brewer, has sponsored
educational programs since 1984, based on what Ms. Conlisk called
the company's belief that education is the way to reduce alcohol
abuse.
   In the past, Miller has been criticized by anti-drinking
activists who claim the brewer has taken an inconsistent and
irresponsible approach toward selling its product.
   In March, for example, Miller was rebuked for running
advertisements in college newspapers' advertising supplements
intending to capitalize on the rollicking atmosphere of spring
vacation. Miller later withdrew and apologized for the ads, which
featured tips for men on how to `scam babes'' at the beach.
   In June, then-U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop issued a set
of proposals that would ban alcohol advertisements on college
campuses and outlaw ads using celebrities who appeal to youths.
   Beer industry officials complained Koop's effort amounted to an
anti-alcohol campaign. They said while Koop's proposal went too
far, the industry as a whole was moving toward empashizing more
responsible drinking in an effort to discourage drunken driving.
   On New Year's Eve, Miller and its distributors will sponsor free
bus and taxi rides and designated-driver programs in many U.S.
cities to promote responsible drinking and safe driving, Ms.
Conlisk said.
   ``This is really a concerted effort nationwide to reinforce the
moderation theme,'' she said.
   Anheuser-Busch of St. Louis, Miller's top competitor, will use
the Budweiser Clydesdales in the brewers' long-running ``Know When
to Say When'' advertising campaign.

<UNK>FTC Clears Icahn to Acquire Bigger Stake in USX Corp.</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal antitrust regulators have cleared
investor Carl C. Icahn to acquire a bigger stake in USX Corp., the
Federal Trade Commission said Tuesday.
   The agency said it had granted Icahn early termination of the
waiting period required under federal law to ensure that certain
mergers and acquisitions do not violate antitrust law.
   Icahn, known for his past corporate takeover attempts, also owns
Trans World Airlines Inc.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission last
month, Icahn revealed he was seeking FTC permission to acquire at
least 25 percent of USX, a Pittsburgh-based steel and energy
company.
   FTC clearance for such an acquisition is required under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.
   The FTC announced Icahn's acquisition of USX was among the
transactions granted clearance, or early termination from the
waiting period. No other information was provided by the FTC.
   USX spokesman William Kessler declined to comment on Icahn's
filing.
   Icahn was in meetings Tuesday, his secretary said. He did not
immediately return calls seeking comment.
   Icahn's November SEC filing showed he owned nearly 34 million,
or 13.26 percent, of USX's outstanding shares of common stock. The
document said Icahn intended to acquire more than 15 percent of
USX's voting securities ``and, depending upon market conditions,
more than 25 percent'' of its voting securities.
   The filing said the acquisition was dependent on market
conditions and redemption or invalidation of a ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan adopted by USX on Oct. 10 in an attempt to
ward off a hostile takeover.

<HEAD>Seek to Keep Secret Documents in Wrongful Firing Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mobil Oil Corp. is trying to keep under
wraps court documents that a former executive wants to use as proof
to show the oil giant fired him for refusing to conspire in a
coverup of environmental problems.
   Mobil argues that most of the documents are irrelevant to Valcar
Bowman Jr.'s case, and says it is happy to release portions _
mostly sentences and paragraphs _ of the papers that it considers
central to his claims.
   The nation's second-largest oil company behind Exxon Corp.,
denying it has anything to hide, also argues that the reports are
self-criticisms encouraged by environmental regulators, and that
revealing them would discourage industry attempts to be candid
about environmental conditions.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman scheduled a hearing for 4
p.m. Wednesday to decide whether the documents should be kept
secret.
   On Dec. 11, Ackerman dealt the company a setback in the case,
ruling that enough evidence existed for a trial to take place on
Bowman's claims.
   Bowman says he was wrongfully fired in April 1986 from his job
as manager for environmental affairs at Mobil Chemical Co.'s
Princeton, N.J. office.
   He lost his job, Bowman says, because he refused to ``sanitize''
environmental assessment reports about conditions at plants in the
chemical division. The changes were suggested by company lawyers.
   Bowman was told to submit the reports to company lawyers after
he refused to cooperate with what he charged was an attempt to foil
investigators from examining environmental records at Mobil's
Bakersfield, Calif., chemical plant.
   The company ordered him to remove records following a raid at a
Torrance, Calif., plant, Bowman alleged.
   Mobil denies wrongdoing, calling Bowman's claims a
``garden-variety'' wrongful firing lawsuit. The company said it had
a right to terminate Bowman, and did so as part of an economic
cutback. Mobil also denies seeking to mask environmental problems,
and accused Bowman of releasing secret company documents to
competitors.
   Mobil also says changes in the environmental reports were minor
matters of wording and typographical errors.
   The focus of Wednesday's hearing is expected to be 20 or so
assessment reports, some filed by each side.
   They are ``the heart of the case,'' said Bowman's attorney,
Stephen B. Wiley. The reports are ``all directly relevant to the
proceeding and should be available to the public,'' he said. ``It's
a public proceeding.''
   Wiley said Mobil was seeking to exclude the public from
Wednesday's hearing, but Mobil attorney Richard Reibstein denied
that.
   ``The reason we're protecting the privacy of these reports is so
we can continue to do them,'' said Mobil Chemical's general
counsel, Ron Neill. ``The whole objective here is in the public
interest.'' If companies felt their self-criticisms could ever be
splashed across newspapers, they would be discouraged from making
such evaluations, he said.

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS ``weekend'' to ``weekday'' in 5th graf: ``This would,''</HEAD>

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. announced
today it will reduce rates by $300 million a year on interstate and
international long-distance services used primarily by residential
and small business customers.
   The price reductions will take effect Jan. 1, AT&amp;T said The
company said they would apply to its basic long-distance service
plus international calls and the AT&amp;T ``Reach Out America'' and
optional long-distance plans.
   The reduction would be the company's 10th since 1984 and would
bring total rate decreases to 40 percent in the six years since the
breakup of the Bell System, the company announcement said.
   The company said a 10-minute call, at any time of day to
anywhere in the United States, will cost $2.50 or less after the
decrease takes effect. At night or on a weekend, such calls will
cost $1.32 or less, it said.
   This would be a reduction of 1.3 percent on weekday calls and 2
percent on evening calls, the company said.
   AT&amp;T said price cuts, filed today with the Federal
Communications Commission, reflect reduced expenses, mainly from
lower fees that the company will pay in 1990 to local telephone
companies for access to customers' lines.
   Under FCC guidelines, those costs savings lower the price cap on
AT&amp;T long-distance services.
   The proposal includes:
   _A 1.3 percent drop in prices for basic long-distance service
during the weekday calling period, which is 8 a.m. to 5. p.m. local
time Monday through Friday, and a 2 percent drop during the evening
period, 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Friday.
   _Increasing discounts for subscribers to the Reach Out America
24-hour plan from 5 percent to 10 percent on weekday calls and from
20 to 25 percent on evening calls, 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through
Friday.
   _A $104 million price slash on international calls from the U.S.
mainland to 25 of the most frequently called countries and overseas
areas, with the reductions varying by country and time of day.
Countries include Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom,
France, Italy, Israel, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines, Taiwan
and Korea.
   _Reductions in the price of service to 39 countries by AT&amp;T
World Connect, which gives frequent international callers a
discount on direct-dialed calls from the U.S. mainland.
   _A reduction in basic long-distance prices from Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands to 95 countries and territories.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Tuesday it will cut
about 300 jobs due to the sale of some clearing accounts from the
company's Broadcort Capital Corp. subsidiary to Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Merrill Lynch said in a
statement that the ``selected staff reductions'' would occur at
Broadcort and related Merrill Lynch support areas over the next few
months.
   Merrill Lynch said the agreement primarily would affect
clearings of Broadcort's retail-oriented accounts. Clearings are
the financial settlements of clients' securities transactions.
   Retail transactions account for about 45 percent of Broadcort's
current business. Merrill spokesman Fred Yager declined to say how
much of the retail activity was being transferred to Donaldson
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette's Pershing Division.
   Yager said the changes are part of a restructuring announced by
Merrill Lynch executives last month. The firm said it would realign
or eliminate unprofitable areas, cut operating costs and trim
investment bankers' bonuses because of a prolonged slump in the
securities industry.
   Merrill Lynch, the nation's largest retail brokerage with 40,500
employees and 12,600 brokers worldwide, also said layoffs were
likely but it did not give an estimate.
   Yager said the job cuts related to the Broadcort transaction
would be achieved through attrition and transfers. Broadcort,
formed in 1977, is a unit of Merrill Lynch's Professional
Securities Services Group in the firm's equity markets division.

   Struggling U.S. automakers are likely to announce
more assembly plant layoffs in coming days, adding to the 107,000
workers who will be idled in January and causing a domino effect in
the industry's supply chain.
   Sources at Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp., speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Tuesday that more temporary assembly
plant shutdowns probably will be announced later this week. Ford
Motor Co. said Monday that 11 of its 16 assembly plants would be
down for at least a week each next month.
   The layoffs, coupled with slumping sales and scant prospects of
quick relief, mean there's a recession in the auto industry, some
analysts have said.
   In all, the Big Three say 35 of their 54 U.S. assembly plants
will halt production for at least a week each in January, affecting
more than 107,000 employees. That comes amid predictions of
continued weak sales in early 1990.
   ``Maybe there really is a recession if you're talking about GM,
Ford and Chrysler,'' said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc. of New York.
   However, she said, the whole industry is suffering a less severe
sales slump than the Big Three. Japanese cars, whether made in the
United States in ``transplants'' or in Japan, are enjoying healthy
sales, she said.
   But the recent sales slump and impending layoffs among the Big
Three automakers, which make nearly two-thirds of the cars and
trucks sold in the United States, paint a darker picture.
   ``There's no question that the fourth-quarter experience has
been one of doom and gloom,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co. of New York. He, like others, expected the Big
Three's slumping sales to continue into the first half of the year.
   Ford Vice Chairman Harold Poling said Tuesday that if the
Federal Reserve Board takes steps to stimulate the economy, as many
economists believe it will, Ford's plant shutdowns could be held to
the 11 announced Monday.
   ``I would think that the actions we have taken will get our
inventories in line,'' said Poling, who will become Ford chairman
in March, when Donald Petersen retires. ``And if we see some action
on the part of the Fed to reduce interest rates, then I think that
those actions might be enough.
   ``In the event that we don't see the actions taken ... then it
may not. It's just very difficult to predict that.''
   It's also difficult to predict the domino effect of closing an
assembly plant, mainly because of the adoption of the
``just-in-time'' manufacturing system. In this strategy, parts
arriving at an assembly spend little, if any, time in a warehouse,
going instead directly from the truck or train to the assembly line.
   The system cuts costs and lets manufacturers keep tighter
controls on quality by spotting a problem in a component before
taking delivery of a large number of them.
   Assembly plants, which can employ 1,500 to 4,000 people apiece,
receive components from a variety of suppliers, some owned by the
manufacturers and others that are independent.
   Those suppliers may have different policies about their own
production schedules when an assembly plant stops making vehicles.
   If the supplier is an outside company, it may have other
customers for its products or an in-house retail system which
maintains a market for its products even when the assembly plant
closes.
   For instance, if a manufacturer announces that a car plant will
be shut down for a week, a steelmaker works right up to the time
that the assembly plant stops.
   The steel company then has several options, which ranging from
building its own inventory to selling to other customers to halting
production and laying off workers.
   This makes it difficult to estimate how many layoffs in the
supply industry may stem directly from assembly plant closings.
   Sheldon Wesson, a spokesman for the American Iron and Steel
Institute in Washington, said automakers are steel companies'
biggest customers.
   ``What tends to happen here in the relationship between steel
and automotive,'' he said, ``is as soon as the automotive industry
sneezes, steel reaches for a handkerchief.''

   Stock prices continued to sag Tuesday amid
persistent worries about the future course of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.92 to
2,695.61, extending its loss over the past four sessions to 65.48
points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
513 up, 1,021 down and 479 unchanged.
   Analysts said the latest economic reports from the government
hadn't done much to pull the market out of its recent slide,
induced to a great extent by worries about the real estate market
and mortgage debt.
   The Labor Department reported that the consumer price index rose
0.4 percent in November, or at an annual rate of 4.9 percent. That
appeared to put a new obstacle before any fresh moves by the
Federal Reserve to relax its credit policy.
   Separate government figures showed a 4.7 percent decline in
housing starts last month.
   Brokers said that left stocks in the grip of recession fears and
of talk that a slump in business conditions might be exacerbated by
a weak market for homes and other real-estate properties.
   A few recently depressed mortgage and regional banking stocks
staged a rebound. Federal National Mortgage rose 1] to 32{, and
Bank of New England gained { to 8.
   But elsewhere among the regional bank stocks, First Fidelity
Bancorp dropped { to 21]; First Interstate Bancorp ] to 42};
Citytrust Bancorp | to 14, and Fleet-Norstar Financial { to 23}.
   Money-center bank stocks were mixed. Citicorp rose [ to 27;
Chase Manhattan added \ to 32[; J.P. Morgan lost ] to 40\, and
Bankamerica was up | at 24{.
   The battered technology sector also attracted
``bargain-hunting'' buyers. International Business Machines gained
1[ to 94}; Digital Equipment 2[ to 84]; Hewlett-Packard 1 to 45{,
and Unisys \ to 14[.
   Unisys said it expected to post a ``significant'' profit in
1990, in large measure because of cust-cutting steps taken this
year.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 186.06 million
shares, against 184.79 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 224.98 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $13.98 billion, or 0.42
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .77 to 189.40.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 1.14 to 392.46, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.23 at 342.46.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.68 to 434.35. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 367.95, down 2.91.

   The dollar finished slightly higher Tuesday
against most major currencies but slipped against the Japanese yen
in quiet global foreign exchange dealings.
   Gold prices were narrowly mixed. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid for gold as of 4 p.m. EST of $411.75 a troy
ounce, down $1 from Monday's late bid. Earlier, gold gained on New
York's Commodity Exchange and in Europe.
   Currency analysts said the pace of trading has slowed in recent
days as the yearend holidays approach and traders try to protect
whatever gains they may have made for the year.
   ``We are in a holiday trading period, and a lot of bank traders
are not as active as they had been,'' said James Merrill, senior
international economist for the financial services company
McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei.
   He said the currency markets appeared to be largely unaffected
by new government reports of a decline in housing starts and a
slightly bigger-than-expected rise in consumer prices last month.
   The 4.7 percent decline in housing starts indicated some
sluggishness in the economy, weakness that many analysts feel the
Federal Reserve will eventually respond to by lowering interest
rates.
   But the 0.4 percent rise in consumer prices was slightly
stronger than analysts had expected, and could delay the Fed's
credit relaxation.
   Dollar traders were also wary about making big commitments until
they get some indication from the two-day meeting of Federal
Reserve policymakers on what course they have charted for monetary
policy over the next few weeks.
   If the Fed moves to lower interest rates, the dollar could be
hurt since falling interest rates cut the returns foreigners get on
dollar-denominated investments.
   The dollar's decline against the yen was attributed to
speculation that the Bank of Japan may soon raise its key lending
rate. Japanese authorities denied the rumors of an imminent rate
hike, but speculation persisted that an increase would eventually
be necessary to shore up the yen.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.42 Japanese yen to close at 143.80
yen. Later, in London, the dollar was quoted at 143.80 yen. The
dollar fell to 143.65 yen in New York from 143.725 yen late Monday.
   The dollar gained against the British pound. In London, the
pound fell to $1.6005 from $1.6020 late Monday. In New York, the
pound fell to $1.6010 from $1.60685.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Monday, included: 1.7365 West German marks, up from 1.7210; 1.5565
Swiss francs, up from 1.5410; 5.9275 French francs, up from 5.8800;
1,289.25 Italian lire, up from 1,285.00; and 1.16085 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.16075.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates Monday,
included: 1.7365 West German marks, up from 1.7245; 1.5615 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5480; 5.9300 French francs, up from 5.8890;
1.9575 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9455; 1,291.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,289.25; and 1.1613 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1610.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
edged up 10 cents a troy ounce to $411.90.
   Earlier, gold rose to $413.75 a troy ounce in London from
$409.25 late Monday; to $414.00 in Zurich from $408.50 and to
$412.80 in Hong Kong from $410.97.
   On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery fell 3.8 cents
an ounce to $5.527. Silver rose in London to a late bid of $5.57 a
troy ounce from $5.55 late Monday.

<HEAD>Michael Quinlan Named McDonald's Chairman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael R. Quinlan, president and chief executive
of McDonald's Corp., will succeed Fred L. Turner as chairman of the
world's largest restaurant chain on March 31, the company announced
Tuesday.
   Quinlan, 45, said in an interview that he wants to put the
Golden Arches in China and that McDonald's customers will likely
see more dinner-type entrees added to the menu in coming years.
   ``The challenge to McDonald's is to be more things to more
people, the same philosophy we've been following for many years
now,'' Quinlan said.
   Turner, 56, will become senior chairman and continue as chairman
of the board's executive committee, McDonald's said in a statement.
   The post of senior chairman was previously held by company
founder Ray Kroc from 1977 _ when Turner succeeded Kroc as chairman
_ until Kroc's death in 1984.
   Quinlan joined McDonald's in 1963 as a part-time mailroom
employee. He served as a McDonald's restaurant manager, field
service manager, district and regional manager before being named a
vice president in 1974.
   He rose quickly through the executive ranks and was named in
1980 to the newly created position of president of McDonald's
U.S.A., in charge of domestic operations. Quinlan was named
president and chief operating officer of the corporation in 1982
and became chief executive officer in 1987.
   Quinlan will continue as CEO after assuming the chairmanship but
the position of corporate president will be eliminated.
   Industry analysts said Quinlan has been largely in charge of
operations since the mid-80s while Turner has been more involved in
strategic decisions.
   Among Quinlan's goals are further expansion of McDonald's into
Eastern Europe. The company has restaurants in Yugoslavia and
Hungary and plans to open one in Moscow on Jan. 31.
   The company also hopes to put a restaurant in Beijing, Quinlan
said.
   ``We've made some preliminary inquiries, we're studying the
infrastructure and we're searching for a partner over there,'' he
said. ``We're bullish on it.''
   The fast-food giant, based in the Chicago suburb of Oak Brook,
has 11,000 restaurants in more than 50 countries. International
business accounts for about 30 percent of McDonald's earnings,
which totaled $646 million last year.
   Analysts see foreign expansion and successful implementation of
an eat-in dinner menu as two keys to continued growth at
McDonald's, since the markets for fast-food breakfast, lunch and
take-out food are crowded with competitors.
   McDonald's has been test-marketing pizza and fried chicken, and
the company reportedly is considering low lighting, music and
platter-type dinners for suppertime customers.
   Quinlan will head a relatively youthful senior management team
which also includes Ed Rensi, 45, president of McDonald's U.S.A.,
and Jim Cantalupo, 46, president of the company's international
operations.

<HEAD>Freeze Fears Power Limit Gains In Orange Juice Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasts for a frosty weekend in Florida's citrus belt drove
orange juice futures prices up sharply Tuesday while harsh winter
weather in the North spurred the heating-oil market to greater
gains.
   On other commodity markets Tuesday, grains and soybeans,
livestock and meat, and precious-metals futures were mixed.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice futures settled 5 cents to 5.4
cents higher on the New York Cotton Exchange with the contract for
delivery in January at $1.3245 a pound. Orange juice futures
normally are limited to daily moves of 5 cents but the limit on the
January contract has been lifted pending the contract's upcoming
expiration.
   The runup reflected predictions for freezing temperatures
Saturday and Sunday night in the Florida citrus region, the result
of an intensifying cold air mass that shattered records in the
Northern Plains on Tuesday and was working its way east and south.
   The severity and timing of the cold wave are reminiscent of a
deep freeze that badly damaged the Flordia orange crop six years
ago, said Celeste Georkakis, an analyst in New York with Cargill
Investor Services Inc.
   Nevertheless, she said, ``being that weather forecasters have
been predicting freezes all along, the growers will be better
prepared than in 1983, when the freeze came on Christmas Eve.''
   A hard freeze forecast for the citrus country last week failed
to materialize. Freezing temperatures touched only the northernmost
edge of the citrus groves.
   Heating-oil for near-term delivery rose on the New York
Mercantile Exchange for the third straight day and the 14th time in
the last 15 sessions, still supported by strong, weather-driven
demand for increasingly tight supplies.
   Crude-oil futures finished mixed after a day of erratic price
swings linked to the expiration of the January contract, which went
off the board 11 cents higher at $22.33 a barrel. Gasoline and
deferred deliveries of heating oil finished lower.
   An American Petroleum Institute report released after the close
showed a 1.7-million-barrel reduction in U.S. stocks of petroleum
distillates last week while inventories of crude oil rose 4.1
million barrels and gasoline stocks rose by 3.6 million barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 15 cents lower
to 11 cents higher with February at $21.28 a barrel; heating oil
was .94 cent lower to .35 cent higher with January at 75.01 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was .58 cent to 1.2 cents lower with
January at 53.93 cents a gallon.
   Wheat futures prices rose modestly Tuesday on the Chicago Board
of Trade on indications that China had bid for 410,000 metric tons
of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices. Corn closed mixed and soybean
futures finished lower.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department announced it had
targeted the Soviet Union for sales of 2 million metric tons of
wheat at subsidized prices, which could prompt further buying of
wheat futures Wednesday.
   All grain contracts for December deliveries expired at noon
Central time. December wheat went off the board 4 cents lower at
$4.11 a bushel, December corn was 1 cent lower at $2.33{ a bushel
and December oats were 2 cents lower at $1.40 a bushel. There was
no December soybean contract.
   Wheat futures settled } cent to 2\ cents higher with March at
$4.14\ a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1\ cents higher with
March at $2.38} a bushel; oats were \ cent to } cent higher with
March at $1.52{ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2{ cents lower
with January at $5.78{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished mixed on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange with cattle mostly higher, boosted by strong
cash fundamentals.
   Live cattle futures settled .07 cent lower to .78 cent higher
with December at 78.92 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent
lower to .43 cent higher with January at 84.60 cents a pound; live
hogs were .12 cent lower to .27 cent higher with December at 53.45
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .53 cent lower
with February at 51.60 cents a pound.
   Gold futures ended nearly unchanged on New York's Commodity
Exchange while silver futures slipped moderately.
   Gold settled unchanged to .10 cent higher with December at
$411.90 a troy ounce; silver was 3.8 cents to 5.5 cents lower with
December at $5.527 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   Employees have been living with uncertainty at
Trans World Ailines Inc. ever since Carl Icahn bought the carrier
in 1986, but now they believe the handwriting on the wall is
becoming clearer.
   TWA, which began the decade as one of the nation's largest
airlines, is in serious danger of disappearing in the early 1990s,
industry analysts and workers say.
   The airline is saddled with $2.7 billion in debt, its 218
airplanes are among the oldest used by major carriers, and pilots,
mechanics and flight attendants are frustrated and disillusioned
about their future.
   On Monday, TWA announced plans to sell its Chicago-to-London
route and four gates and a dormant maintenance facility at
Chicago's O'Hare Airport to American Airlines for $195 million, a
move that shocked and angered workers.
   The sale is subject to regulatory approval.
   ``It's very difficult to see how selling a route to a competitor
can be beneficial,'' said Herb Johnson, president of the Machinists
union's Local 1650 in Kansas City. ``Selling the London route just
doesn't compute.''
   Johnson, who heads the airline's largest union local, said
workers can't help but wonder if they're going to have a carrier to
work for in 1990. And it's particularly upsetting to see the route
go to a fierce rival like American.
   ``American is a tough competitor. Everyone knows that once they
get in your markets, they'll blow your doors off,'' Johnson said.
``Market share is everything in this business and when you start
reducing that you're in trouble.''
   Icahn said the proposed sale will help restore profitability at
TWA, which has already lost $117 million for the first nine months
of 1989 and is expected to lose between $230 million to $300
million for the year.
   TWA is headquartered in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., but has one of its
largest hub operations in St. Louis.
   Icahn, who took the company private last year, said the company
will need the money from the sale to make it through a slump in
business that's already under way and to survive an industry
consolidation in the mid-'90s.
   ``There is a time to invest and a time to be cautious, and now
is the time to be cautious,'' Icahn told employees in three-page
letter on the state of TWA.
   But no one at TWA or in the airline industry seems to believe
that caution is what prompted the sale to American.
   Some analysts believe Icahn is trying to raise more money to buy
additional stock in USX Corp., a company he's been rumored to be
interested in buying for years.
   In fact, on Tuesday, Icahn received permission from the Federal
Trade Commission to acquire a bigger stake _ at least 25 percent _
of USX, a Pittsburgh-based steel and energy company.
   Icahn currently owns 34 million, or 13.6 percent, of USX's
outstanding common shares.
   There's also speculation that Icahn has found an airline that
wants to buy TWA and Icahn is now trying to streamline the airline
to help avoid any antitrust violations.
   ``This sale could be consistent with a lot of different theories
about what's goig to happen to TWA,'' said Paul Turk, an analyst
with Avmark, Inc., an aviation consulting firm based in Arlington,
Va.
   Kent Scott, chairman of the TWA unit of the Air Line Pilots
Association, said he believes Monday's proposed sale is the
beginning of the complete liquidation of the airline.
   ``I think he's testing the water of opposition in the regulatory
agencies and if he gets this one through he can use it as a
precedent when he proposes others,'' said Scott, who is based in
St. Louis.
   The next routes for sale may be the coast-to-coast flights _ New
York to Los Angeles and San Francisco _ Scott said. Meanwhile,
Scott said he expects the three Boeing 747 airliners used by TWA to
fly from Chicago to London to be up for sale once the American deal
goes through.
   The pilots' union will encourage federal regulators to quash the
deal, Scott said.
   Whatever the reason for Monday's proposed sale, analysts agree
with Icahn that the airline industry has been struggling recently
with higher costs and slackening demand for air travel.
   ``TWA hasn't been performing well and the whole industry hasn't
been doing too well either,'' said Mark Daugherty, a stock analyst
at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York. ``This (Monday's sale)
surgically removes a route that wasn't that important, but it's
hard to say what it means.''

   Campeau Corp., struggling under a
multibillion-dollar debt, says it hopes to reassure lenders who
finance shipments to its department stores that the company's
long-term fiscal health is sound.
   ``We respect the obligations of those with whom we do business
to make financial decisions that they deem to be in their own best
interests. We remain hopeful that we will be able to resolve this
situation favorably, well in advance of spring merchandise
deliveries,'' Carol Sanger, Campeau's vice president of corporate
communications in Cincinnati.
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., owned
by the Toronto-based Campeau, revealed last week that they are
trying to restructure $7 billion in debt and may need to seek U.S.
Bankruptcy Court protection from creditors while reorganizing their
finances. Campeau Corp. assumed more than $8 billion in debt when
it bought Cincinnati-based Federated in May 1988.
   Officials of CIT Group-Factoring, the New York retail lending
company and subsidiary of Manufacturers Hanover Corp., expressed
concern about the retailers' statements that they could run out of
cash by the end of January, endangering payments due suppliers in
February and beyond.
   ``Until the people who sit in the ivory tower in Toronto make
some decisions and let people know what's going on, we are
reserving a decision about future shipments,'' Francis X. Basile,
president and chief executive, said Monday. ``Hopefully, they will
do something positive to allow us to continue to support their
companies.''
   Last week, Heller Financial, a major lender in Chicago, cut off
credit on shipments to Campeau stores after the retailers'
disclosure last Wednesday.
   The moves could halt early delivery of spring merchandise to
Federated and Allied store divisions, including the
Cincinnati-based Lazarus, Burdine's of Miami and Bloomingdale's of
New York. It is not known how many clients represented by Heller
and CIT still plan to ship spring merchandise to the stores.
   CIT and Heller are ``factoring'' companies _ those that extend
credit to retailers and collect suppliers' bills from retailers _
and have significant influence in the apparel industry. Factoring
companies buy manufacturers' products and assume the risks that
those bills will be paid by retailers.
   Without credit from a factoring company, suppliers assume full
risk for payment on their shipments.
   Federated and Allied told the Securities and Exchange Commission
that store revenues and loans will give them enough cash until
mid-March. But money could run out by late January if suppliers
demand quicker payment on bills and lenders cut off money,
officials said.
   ``January 10 is the magical date,'' Basile said. Payments for
merchandise shipments are made on the 10th day of a month.
   Basile said Campeau's disclosure leads him to conclude the
company can meet payments due Jan. 10, but that payments due Feb.
10 could be in danger if the company runs out of cash.

   The cold spell that put parts of the country in
a deep freeze continued to make heating oil a hot commodity
Tuesday, but traders said the frenzied price rally has slowed as
many dealers decided to cash in on the recent runup.
   ``Clearly it ran up just a little too far and a little too
fast,'' said John Hill, a vice president for Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures. ``Some of the buying we saw was panic buying.
   ``Yes, it's cold ... and there's some tightness in supply, but
we're not running out of heating oil.''
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract for
No. 2 home heating oil rose 0.35 cent to 75.01 cents a gallon,
after soaring more than 7 cents in the last two trading sessions.
   Traders said profit-taking kept the price from rising even
higher, and the feeling that the current cold temperatures and
inclement weather won't last too much longer helped push down the
prices of contracts for February, March and April.
   Still, the current wholesale price is now at the highest level
since the winter of 1985-86, according to Hill.
   Meanwhile, the January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
leading grade of U.S. crude oil, was up 11 cents to settle at
$22.33 per 42-gallon barrel.
   The contract had jumped $1.12 on Monday to an eight-month high,
but traders attributed that sharp increase largely to the fact that
the contract was set to expire on Tuesday.
   January unleaded gasoline lost 0.58 cent to close at 53.93 cents
a gallon, after gaining 1.71 cents on Monday.
   Some traders attributed that drop to internal market influences.

<HEAD>Sea Containers Rejects Sweetened Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Sea Containers Ltd. said Tuesday it had rejected
a sweetened $1.04 billion offer by Temple Holdings Ltd. in a
hostile battle for the ferry boat company.
   Sea Containers, which operates ferries in the English Channel,
said its board decided unanimously that its own recapitalization
plan ``provides greater value to the shareholders as a whole'' than
Temple's hostile cash offer.
   Temple, a Swedish and British ferry consortium, on Friday raised
its offer for the second time since it began its takeover bid in
May, this time to $70 a share from $63 a share for Sea Container's
common stock and to $112.70 a share from $101.43 a share for its
convertible preferred stock.
   Sea Containers initial offer totaled $824 million, or $50 a
share per common share and $80.50 for preferred.
   Sea Containers, based in Hamilton, Bermuda, said in a statement
it would proceed with a recapitalization plan offering $70 a share
to sellers of up to 7 million shares in an attempt to increase the
value of its stock.
   The company also said it had sold $733 million in assets to date
as part of the recapitalization plan, including the recent sale of
10 vessels for $92 million. Sea Containers plans to sell more than
$1 billion in assets to help thwart the takeover.
   Sea Containers also dismissed Temple's plan to hold a special
shareholders meeting to elect nominees to replace the current
board, saying Temple would be unable to gather the required
approval of 10 percent of holders of common shares.
   Temple Holdings Ltd. is owned by Sweden's Stena Holdings AG and
Britain's Tiphook PLC. Stena already owns about 8 percent of Sea
Containers stock.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines' sale of its Latin American routes
highlights a declining role for its traditional Miami base, while
the rebuilding carrier puts its emphasis on Atlanta.
   Pan American World Airways and American Airlines, the buyer of
the Latin routes, expect their Miami expansion plans to be
bolstered by Eastern's cutbacks in Miami, where it is the No. 1
carrier.
   In its presentation to creditors in New York on Monday, Eastern
disclosed the planned ``de-hubbing'' of Miami because it ``has been
a source of heavy losses.'' Creditors were told Eastern's planned
sale of Latin American routes, to American, would enable Eastern to
``re-focus on Atlanta as the airline's major hub.''
   The sale of the routes and certain other assets to American for
$471 million was confirmed late Tuesday in an announcement from
American.
   Eastern's revised business plan is ``quite similar'' to its
original rebuilding plan devised last April, as the carrier tried
to recover from a crippling strike. Eastern in August decided to
keep its Latin routes, but recently resumed negotiations with
American because of concerns about a cash shortfall.
   Company spokesman Robin Matell declined to elaborate on the
future of the Miami and Atlanta operations.
   Eastern officials in the past said there were no plans to move
Eastern's corporate headquarters from Miami to Atlanta, but
wouldn't speculate on whether that was a possibility later.
   Eastern has 260 departures from Atlanta, where it is second to
Delta Airlines. It had 285 departures from Atlanta before the
strike. Eastern spokespeople said no projections were available
Tuesday on the total flights planned for Atlanta.
   Before the March 4 strike, Eastern operated about 10 percent of
its daily schedule of 1,040 flights out of Miami. Eastern officials
had said recently that sale of the Latin routes could leave as few
as 24 Miami departures daily.
   Eastern, building back while in Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization, is back to 76 daily departures from Miami.
   Peter Reavely, chief of aviation development at Miami
International Airport, said he expects New York-based Pan Am to
become the airport's major carrier between Miami and the Northeast,
and Texas-based American would dominate between Miami and Sun Belt
destinations.
   ``The effect is positive for us,'' Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela
Hanlon said of Eastern's plans. ``One of the primary reasons (for)
building up Miami was to fill the void left by Eastern's diminished
operations. What they are saying regarding the `de-hubbing'
supports the decision we made earlier.''
   Pan Am has boosted its daily Miami departures to 70, from 48 one
year ago.
   American has 36 departures from Miami, is expanding its American
Eagle commuter service there, and has made Miami the headquarters
for its new Florida-Caribbean-Latin Services Division.
   ``We see Miami as a very important part of the American system,
particularly feeding traffic from the Caribbean,'' American
spokesman Ed Stewart said.

   American Airlines Inc., which became the No. 1
domestic carrier this year, is taking advantage of sales by
competitors and expected industry weakness next year to push its
international expansion and become more than an American airline.
   The moves are necessary, analysts say, if American is to become
a ``player'' internationally. It currently has 5 percent of the
European market.
   Fast and furious dealmaking could also have the pleasant side
effect of making parent AMR Corp. less attractive to a corporate
raider by decreasing cash and depressing earnings.
   ``We have developed at American Airlines a very wide-ranging
growth plan that we have been pursuing for five years that is long
range in nature and will carry us into the next century,'' said
company spokesman Al Becker.
   ``One piece of it is international expansion. That includes
Europe, the Pacific Rim and eventually Latin America.'' American
also has talked to Aeroflot about gaining entrance to the Soviet
Union, Becker said.
   ``These are good long-term moves and if they affect earnings in
the short term, they can deal with that,'' said analyst Mark
Daugherty at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York.
   American, based in Fort Worth, took the Latin American plunge in
one move Tuesday, saying it would pay Eastern Airlines $471 million
for its 20 Central and South American routes, plus the rights to
some other European cities and some domestic facilities.
   Just Monday, American announced a $195 million deal with Trans
World Airlines Inc. for its Chicago-London route, plus four gates
and a maintenance hangar at Chicago O'Hare International Airport.
Also a bankruptcy court judge approved American's $400,000 purchase
of Braniff landing rights at Chicago and New York.
   By the middle of next year, American will have about 165 flights
weekly to 18 European cities. Six years ago, it flew to none.
   American has been expanding vigorously this year, spending
billions on new airplanes to fly its newly acquired, or
sought-after routes; beginning work on a $400 million maintenance
facility to service the jets; expanding its operations at domestic
hubs; and fighting off billionaire Donald Trump, aided in large
degree by the collapse of another airline buyout.
   This year alone, American has begun service to Stockholm,
Sweden; Lyon, France, Brussels, Belgium; Hamburg, Dusseldorf and
Stuttgart, West Germany; and Zurich, Switzerland. In addition, next
year, American will add service to Barcelona, Spain; Helsinki,
Finland; Warsaw, Poland; and Glasgow, Scotland.
   In the Pacific, American next year will begin flying to Sydney,
Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. Also, independent of any deal
with Eastern, American has announced increased service to
Monterrey, Cancun and Cozumel, Mexico.
   The airline also is trying to add a second Tokyo flight, and is
investigating flights to Seoul, Korea; Taipei, Taiwan; Hong Kong;
Singapore; and Manila.
   Additionally, American is considering expanding service in
Canada, which it does not consider among its international
destinations.
   The growth has been financed through record profits, although
Chairman Robert Crandall has warned the performance won't continue
this quarter or next year.
   But the company has plenty of cash, and an appetite for spending.
   ``There's a good deal of expansion we still want to do in
Europe,'' Becker said. ``Our basic feeling is that some of the
opportunities that are out there may not be as readily available in
1992'' when many interior European trade barriers fall.
   ``Part of our strategy is to build as much of our route system
before 1992 as we can,'' he said because of fears outsiders will
have difficulty competing in a unified European market.
   American had no international service in 1982 after jettisoning
unprofitable Pacific service in the mid-70s. An old subsidiary,
American Overseas Airways, was sold to Pan American in the early
'50s.
   American is not endangering its financial health through the
expansion, the analysts said.
   ``They're not going out and buying assets willy nilly,'' said
Edward Starkman at PaineWebber. ``It's one of the best-run
companies in this industry.''
   But analyst Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton sounded a
warning note.
   ``I really think that you don't necessarily want to take $500
million or $200 million cash and give it to a competitor that would
be out of business in a year,'' she said, referring to Eastern and
TWA. ``You sort of have to wonder if they could buy these assets
out of bankruptcy at a cheaper price than they're doing today.''

<HEAD>No Talks in Sight for Boeing Engineers After Contract Rejection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. faced a new labor threat Tuesday from
the engineers and scientists who play a crucial role in designing
its planes, less than a month after a crippling Machinists strike
ended at the aerospace giant.
   In ballots counted Monday night, those members of the Seattle
Professional Engineering Employees Association voted 69 percent to
reject a three-year contract offer from the world's largest
commercial airline builder.
   Although members also voted by 52 percent not to authorize their
negotiators to call a strike, the union said it might be well into
1990 before the contract talks resume.
   ``Our executive director has been in touch with the director of
labor relations at Boeing and we've made known our availability at
any time,'' said Dan Mahoney, union general counsel.
   ``However, it appears the rejection was quite a surprise to
company negotiators and they weren't prepared for it, so they have
to assemble their negotiating team.''
   Company negotiators apparently had made commitments to other
activities and face a logistical problem in getting them all back
together, Mahoney said.
   ``Right now, if I had to guess, it would be after the first of
the year'' before negotiations will resume, Mahoney said.
   Boeing officials were meeting to discuss the situation, but
there was no indication when talks might resume, company spokesman
Paul Binder said.
   The engineering union's other unit, which represents Boeing
technical and support workers, ratified a separate three-year pact
by nearly 2 to 1. Both contracts expired Dec. 1.
   The offer rejected by engineers, who now make an average of
nearly $40,000 a year, included a 3 percent wage increase, a
productivity bonus of 10 percent of gross pay in the first year and
no further general increases.
   Technicians, with average pay of about $28,000, accepted wage
increases of up to 3 percent and bonuses of up to 10 percent.
   Mahoney said the union was sending a survey to its engineer
members ``so when we do go to the table we'll know what to ask
for.''
   He added, however, that ``the engineers feel the money offer
undervalued their services. I do believe they (company negotiators)
will have to offer more money.''
   Members of the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers voted Nov. 18 to end a 48-day strike and accept a
three-year pact.

<TEXT>
   Plans to trade gold options and options on oat
futures contracts at two Chicago futures exchanges were approved
Tuesday by federal regulators.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees the
futures industry, approved the two plans unanimously, 5-0.
   A futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity,
like oats, at a specified price by a specified date.
   One of the approved proposals was for the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange to trade physical gold options.
   That will give the holder of a CME gold option contract the
right to buy or sell 100 troy ounces of gold at a specified strike
price on the delivery date.
   A strike price is the price at which an option holder can choose
to exercise the right to buy or sell the underlying futures
contract.
   The contract is designed to be a hedging instrument, whereby
producers, buyers and sellers of gold can lock in a favorable price
for transactions at a later date.
   The CFTC also approved a proposal by the Chicago Board of Trade
for trading options in its oats futures contracts. Holders of such
options will be able to buy or sell oat futures contracts on any
trading day prior to the contract's expiration. The trading months
will be based on the underlying futures delivery months of March,
May, July, September and December.

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Top Shareholders Re-evaluating Positions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A descendant of Campbell Soup Co. founder John
T. Dorrance Sr. said Tuesday she is re-evaluating her stock
position with other family members following the dissolution of
their 26.5 percent voting trust.
   Hope H. van Beuren disclosed in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission that since reacquiring voting power over her
7.9 million Campbell shares, she and other family members are
discussing what to do with their stock.
   While Mrs. van Beuren said she had ``no present plans or
proposals'' the discussions have included the possibility of a
merger, reorganization or liquidation of all or part of the Camden,
N.J., food company.
   Also under discussion, according to the SEC filing, are the
possible sale or transfer of some or all of Campbell's assets.
   Dorrance family members control about 58 percent of Campbell
stock.
   But the family has maintained, since the death of John ``Jack''
Dorrance Jr., that it would vote its shares in a single block.
   Earlier this month, however, family members voted to dissolve
the voting trust, created in 1987, that controlled a 26.5 percent
stake of the company.
   The news spurred investor speculation that the company would be
sold, at a time when Campbell's board of directors is looking for a
successor to president R. Gordon McGovern, who resigned last month.

   American Airlines announced its anticipated deal
with Eastern Airlines Tuesday, saying it would buy Latin American
routes and certain other assets from Eastern's parent company for
$471 million.
   The deal with Texas Air Corp. in one stroke makes American a
major international carrier, giving it 20 destinations in 15
Central and South American countries.
   In addition to the Latin American routes, American also gets a
Miami-to-London route from Eastern's sister carrier Continental
Airlines and Eastern's routes to Toronto from Miami and Tampa,
Fla., and its unused route authority from Miami to Madrid, Spain.
   Plus, American gets Continental and Eastern slots at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York and Eastern slots at New
York's LaGuardia Airport, Miami International Airport, Washington
National Airport, O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and San
Juan, Puerto Rico.
   American and Continental also agreed to a gate exchange at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
   The deal had been rumored to be imminent for more than a week as
Eastern seeks cash to help it emerge from bankruptcy protection.
The bankruptcy court and government regulators have to approve the
sale, which is a key part of Eastern's reorganization plan.
   Separately, Eastern said it will sell the 14 Lockheed L-1011
aircraft currently used to serve the Latin American routes.
American, which has spent billions of dollars on new jets recently,
said it wasn't interested in the L-1011s. They range in age from
12.5 years to 17 years.
   Besides the routes and landing slots, Texas Air agreed to drop a
$1 billion lawsuit against Sabre, American parent AMR Corp.'s
computer reservations systems. Texas Air subsidiary Continental
Airlines claimed Sabre, which is used by travel agents to book
passengers and is the largest such U.S. system, unfairly favored
American flights.
   Although deal between American and Eastern had been expected,
negotiations broke down in August, apparently over the disposition
of the lawsuit.
   Analyst Helane Becker at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said
American would have a leg up on European carriers trying to serve
the growing Latin American market because American could route
flights from Europe through its Miami hub, cutting three hours off
the trip.
   ``This transaction will allow our company to continue building
our international network, and it will make the U.S. a strong
competitor in Central and South America by linking that region to
American's extensive route system,'' Chairman Robert L. Crandall
said in a press release.
   American called a news conference for Miami Wednesday morning to
discuss the deal, which it said will create about 2,000 airport and
reservation jobs in that city during the next five years.
   Texas Air said Eastern would realize $349 million from the sale,
while Continental $102.5 million and System One, Texas Air's
reservation system, $19.5 million for the telecommunications
equipment needed to service the routes.
   ``The sale of these assets will enable Eastern Airlines to
continue on its course of successfully rebuilding as a smaller and
stronger airline from the future, with its operation at its Atlanta
hub,'' Texas Air said in a prepared statement.
   Eastern and Continental will continue to operate the routes
until American is ready to take them over, Texas Air said.

   International Business Machines Corp.
on Tuesday announced a partnership with a small software company
that will allow IBM's OfficeVision software to connect with office
software systems of other manufacturers.
   Under the agreement, Soft-Switch, of Wayne, Pa., has designed
software that will allow companies using OfficeVision to exchange
computer documents and electronic mail with office systems made by
Digital Equipment Corp., Wang Laboratories Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and others, IBM said.
   OfficeVision, introduced by IBM in May, allows companies using
various IBM computers of different sizes to tie them together in
one system. The software overcomes the incompatibility of many IBM
products, a shortfall that has been exploited by Digital and other
companies that make only compatible machines.
   The Soft-Switch products will be sold by both IBM and
Soft-Switch. They will be available Dec. 29 and will be priced from
$40,000 to $250,000, IBM said.
   Separately Tuesday, IBM introduced the most powerful member of
its Personal System-2 computer family, a model based on Intel
Corp.'s i486 microprocessor. The model, called the PS-2 Model 70
486, is priced at $12,395 and up.
   In addition, IBM said it would resume shipping a kit to upgrade
its earlier PS-2 Model 70 computers by adding the i486 chip. IBM
stopped shipping the kits in October after Intel alerted it to a
flaw in the chips. The trouble was corrected with a new version of
the microprocessor.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The battle over Pennzoil Co.'s purchase of
$2.1 billion worth of Chevron Corp. stock moved into murky legal
waters Tuesday, with a Pennzoil lawyer asking a federal judge to
lift restrictions on suing the rival oil giant but denying any
intention to sue.
   ``People have a right to be in court,'' Stephen Bomse, a lawyer
for Houston-based Pennzoil, said at a hearing on Chevron's request
for a long-lasting order protecting it from suits by Pennzoil
without court permission. He said the order ``would tie our hands.''
   While Bomse insisted Pennzoil had no plans to sue Chevron over
its anti-takeover maneuvers, Chevron lawyer William Edlund said
Pennzoil has a history of ``hostile, non-passive investments,'' and
added, ``Chevron suspects the motives of Pennzoil.''
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said he would rule within
a few days, and meanwhile left another judge's order in place that
requires Pennzoil to obtain the court's permission before suing San
Francisco-based Chevron in any court over issues related to the
case.
   Chevron, the nation's fourth-largest oil company, sued Pennzoil,
the 14th-largest, on Dec. 7 after learning that Pennzoil bought 8.8
percent of Chevron's common stock.
   Pennzoil said it was making a long-term investment for tax
purposes, to shelter the bulk of a $3 billion settlement it
received from Texaco, and had no intention of acquiring control.
   Chevron challenged those statements, citing Pennzoil's past
attempts at oil company acquisitions, and accused Pennzoil of
concealing its purpose of a takeover or forced restructuring, in
violation of federal securities law.
   The suit seeks to force Pennzoil to sell the stock and prohibit
more purchases without court approval.
   At the same time, Chevron beefed up its defenses against
takeovers, giving its directors a veto over purchases of stock
purchases of more than 10 percent and arranging a $5 billion line
of credit. Five groups of stockholders, none affiliated with
Pennzoil, have sued Chevron management over those moves.
   Pennzoil says the suit is based on unfounded speculation and has
moved to dismiss the case. Henderson, who will hear that motion
Friday, has already ruled that the allegations in the suit are
serious enough to give Chevron access to Pennzoil documents and
executives _ orders Chevron says Pennzoil has largely resisted so
far.
   When it filed the suit, Chevron obtained a temporary restraining
order from Chief U.S. District Judge William Ingram prohibiting any
related suits by Pennzoil without approval of the local court.
Chevron sought an injunction Tuesday that would leave the
prohibition in place until the court disposed of the case.
   ``Chevron believes that Pennzoil will be litigating,'' Edlund,
Chevron's lawyer, told Henderson, saying such suits were common in
takeover attempts.
   He said extending the restrictions would avoid multiple suits
and should not harm Pennzoil, if it is telling the truth about its
intentions.
   But Bomse said Chevron had failed to show any threat of harm
that would entitle it to an injunction.
   ``You can't grant an injunction based on speculation, merely
because Chevron ... may believe that Pennzoil is going to commence
litigation,'' Pennzoil's lawyer said.

<HEAD>EC and EFTA Lay Groundwork for European Economic Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA MACKENZIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 19 European Community and seven
European Free Trade Association nations agreed Tuesday to begin
talks early next year on closer economic cooperation aimed at
forging a so-called European Economic Space.
   The idea is to allow free movement of trade, capital, people and
services between the two trade blocs, said officials at a meeting
here of the EC and EFTA foreign ministers.
   The 12 EC nations are to remove their internal borders by late
1992. This project has sparked fears among the seven EFTA nations
that the single market will occur at the expense of trade with them.
   Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, the foreign minister of Iceland, which
currently holds the EFTA presidency, said he was ``immensely
satisfied'' with the outcome of Tuesday's meeting.
   He said the EFTA nations _ Austria, Iceland, Finland, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland and Liechtenstein _ hoped the talks could start
in early 1990 and be concluded by the end of the year.
   But EC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen was more
cautious, saying the talks must end before Dec. 31, 1992, the date
by which the EC is to complete its single-market project.
   The EC's two-way trade with EFTA, $217 billion, is only slightly
less than its combined two-way trade with the United States and
Japan, which amounts to $230 billion.
   Andriessen said the ministers singled out problems to be solved
in the negotiations for closer economic ties between EFTA and the
EC. The most important is the institutional aspect of the new
EC-EFTA relationship.
   He said each side ``should respect the autonomy'' of its own
decision-making and that this was ``not negotiable'' for the EC. At
best, he said, he could see ``a kind of osmosis'' between the two
blocs' decision-making institutions.
   Hannibalsson said each bloc would continue to monitor compliance
with its own laws after the two sides have expanded their economic
cooperation, creating what officials term a ``European Economic
Space.''
   The foreign ministers also agreed to widen cooperation among the
19 nations in such areas as research and development, the
environment, education, working conditions and social welfare,
consumer protection, programs for small and medium-sized
enterprises and tourism.
   Some cooperation in these areas has already begun. The 1990
European Year of Tourism, for example, is a joint EC-EFTA effort.
   Separately, the EC and EFTA nations signed an agreement under
which they will exchange information on compulsory technical
regulations. This accord takes effect July 1, 1990, and is designed
to prevent obstacles to trade arising from differences in national
technical standards.
   The ministers also signed an agreement to allow universities and
industries in EFTA and EC nations to develop partnerships, exchange
students and staff and take part in joint training projects. This
agreement comes into force Jan. 1.

<HEAD>EC To Propose Farm Reform Plan That Retains Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community will unveil on
Wednesday a proposal to reduce, but not eliminate, farm subsidies
over a period of five years.
   The plan, officials said Tuesday, represents the EC position in
crucial talks to reform agricultural trade in the current round of
talks within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
Geneva-based world trade body.
   The EC position was approved late Monday at a meeting of the 12
EC foreign ministers. It contrasts with that of the United States,
which wants to eventually eliminate all farm subsidies.
   ``With this proposal the EC is taking the initiative in the farm
negotiations,'' an EC Commission source said.
   In it, the EC maintains its opposition to a long-term
elimination of subsidies, calling instead for a ``progressive
reduction in support'' over five years with a review of the
situation at the end of that period.
   Under a U.S. plan presented to GATT, existing agricultural
subsidies would be converted into more visible tariffs that
gradually would be reduced.
   The EC came slightly closer to the U.S. proposal by recommending
a partial conversion of the trade curbs into fixed tariffs. But it
has said cuts in some price supports should be ``rebalanced'' by
raising others.
   The U.S. opposes this, arguing it cannot accept any increases in
trade barriers.
   A controversial element of the EC proposal is the suggestion
that countries receive a ``credit'' for subsidy cuts made since
1986, when the current Uruguay round of GATT talks began.
   The EC says it has built up large credits through changes it has
made in its farm support program over the last three years.
   The EC seeks a ``global'' approach, with all trade-distorting
subsidies _ from export refunds to price guarantees _ covered in
the negotiations. It wants an international agreement on a common
measure of support that would be the basis for subsidy cuts by all
GATT parties.
   For its part, the United States has been looking for commitments
on individual support measures.
