<HEAD>U.S Denies Purported CIA Agent Worked for Agency</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government has denied it was
behind a multi-million-dollar banking scandal that has rocked
Greece's governing Socialist party.
   The State Department, in a statement released to the Associated
Press on Sunday, also said the U.S. government never hired a
self-proclaimed CIA agent who made the allegation.
   A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy, who requested anonymity,
said the statement was given to the state-run television and radio
networks Saturday, but by mid-day Sunday it had received no airplay.
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's party, the Panhellenic Socialist
Movement (PASOK), faced a censure vote Monday brought by the
conservative opposition on grounds the government's alleged
involvement in a $200-million fraud, forgery and embezzlement
scandal threatens the country's security.
   PASOK, with 157 seats in the 300-single chamber Parliament, was
expected to weather the motion during a voice vote.
   The purported agent, Tom Mailis, told a parliamentary
fact-finding committee last week that fugitive banker George
Koskotas was a CIA employee trying to destabilize Greece's
government.
   Koskotas is jailed in Massachusetts pending an extradition
hearing. He faces charges in Greece in connection with the scandal.
   ``The United States government categorically states that the
reported allegations of Mr. Tom Mailis concerning his connections
with the U.S. government are completely without foundation,'' said
the State Department statement released through the U.S. Embassy in
Athens.
   The statement, issued ``as an exception to our general policy of
not commenting on such matters,'' added that ``neither he nor the
others he reportedly has alleged to work for the CIA now work or
ever have worked for the CIA.''
   On Saturday, Papandreou threatened the United States that there
would be ``consequences'' if banker-publisher George Koskotas was
not quickly extradited to Greece.
   Speaking before Parliament during a debate on the censure motion,
Papandreou did not describe the ``consequences'' but made a
reference to his government's decision to shut down one of four U.S.
military installations in Greece.
   He said talks on a new U.S. bases agreement were continuing,
``but their (bases) time of stay in Greece is running out daily.''
   The main conservative opposition New Democracy Party submitted
the censure motion Thursday on the grounds that alleged government
involvement in the scandal posed a ``danger for democracy and
Greece.''
   Koskotas, 34, former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled Greece
in November after being indicted in the scandal. He is jailed in
Salem, Mass.
   Time magazine, in an interview with the banker, quoted him as
saying Papandreou and senior government officials allegedly
authorized plans to embezzle millions from his bank. He also claimed
they received millions of dollars in payoffs.
   Papandreou, who said he will sue Time for running the interview
in its March 13 issue, has charged that there is a ``foreign and
domestic plot'' to overthrow his government.
   To back up the premier's claims of an international conspiracy
against him, the state-run television networks and pro-government
press have played up the allegations made by Mailis to a
parliamentary fact-finding committee investigating the scandal.

<HEAD>Reputed Chicago Crime Boss Dies After Heart Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joseph Ferriola, the reputed chieftain of
organized crime in Chicago, died Saturday following his second heart
transplant in recent weeks. He was 61.
   Ferriola died at 2:50 a.m. in Methodist Hospital, where he was a
patient of well-known heart specialist Dr. Michael DeBakey, hospital
spokeswoman Cindy Lea said. She said she had no further information.
   Ferriola had undergone two heart transplants in the last few
weeks, Chicago television stations WLS and WBBM reported Saturday.
His body rejected the first heart and was rejecting the second when
he died, WLS said.
   Federal officials said Ferriola emerged as the head of organized
crime in Chicago in 1986, after prison sentences were handed to
long-time reputed boss Joseph ``Doves'' Aiuppa and No. 2 man John
``Jackey the Lackey'' Cerone.
   Aiuppa, 81, and Cerone, 74, received 28{-year prison terms for
skimming profits from Las Vegas gambling casinos.
   In the early 1970s, Ferriola served a federal prison term for
taking part in a multimillion-dollar nationwide gambling syndicate,
Healy said.
   Ferriola lived in a 14-room mansion in the wealthy western
Chicago suburb of Oak Brook, the Chicago Tribune said.

   Fire roared through 500
acres of the Big Bend National Park on Saturday, forcing the
evacuation of about 100 campers, authorities said. No injuries were
reported.
   ``We speculate it's man-caused,'' said Big Bend National Park
spokesman Robert Rothe. ``We haven't had any lightning strikes in
the area.''
   Seventeen firefighters battled the High Chisos mountains blaze
which campers reported early Saturday afternoon. A fire crew of
Mescalero Apache Indians from Alamogordo, N.M. was expected Sunday
to help fight the fire.
   `I can look out the window and see the glow of the fire up in the
mountains,'' said Kim Alexander, an assistant manager at Chisos
Mountain Lodge located about 2,000 feet below and at least five
miles from the fire.
   ``The glow of the fire appears over Emory Peak,'' Alexander said.
Emory Peak, at 7,830 feet, is the highest point in the Chisos range.
   The fire burned woodlands, mostly oak, pine and juniper and
trails in the Chisos were closed, officials said.
   About 100 campers, mostly college students on spring break, were
evacuated from the High Chisos area, said park ranger Karen Boucher.
   Rothe said park officials believe the fire wouldn't spread much
Saturday night because of a combination of weather conditions,
including falling temperature and wind speed, and rising humidity.
   The blaze is the first in the 708,221-acre southwest Texas park
this year, Ms. Boucher said. Last year there were 27 brush fires,
she said, but only two scorched more than 300 acres.
   The Chisos Mountain Lodge was filled to capacity with more than
140 visitors Saturday night, Alexander said. He said officials told
him the fire presented no immediate danger to the lodge.

   Rebels attacked an eastern village
Saturday and in the battle six of the raiders and two local
officials were killed, the Sandinista government said.
   Terencio Lopez Marenco, the Sandinista party leader in the
village of Las Iguanas, 180 miles east of Managua, said two young
girls were wounded in the fighting early Saturday.
   He identified the slain government officials as 2nd Lt. Candido
Garcia, the village's civil defense chief, and Panfilo Lira, head of
the agricultural cooperative.
   Lopez Marenco said the rebels belonged to a group that recently
entered Nicaragua from Costa Rica.
   Last week the Defense Ministry accused rebel forces of making
more than 140 attacks against Nicaraguan military and civilian
targets this year in ``open violation of the cease-fire.''
   The rebels' radio station Radio Liberacion said Saturday that
Sandinista troops had violated the cease-fire 69 times in 1989.
   The Sandinistas and rebels agreed to a temporary cease-fire in
March 1988 but peace talks subsequently broke down. The government
then declared a monthly series of unilateral cease-fires beginning
in June 1988 and the insurgents tacitly accepted the truce.
   Both sides claim they have respected the cease-fires.

<TEXT>
   At first glance, Rep. Richard Cheney might seem
an unlikely candidate to run the Pentagon, but his selection by
President Bush won early rave reviews in Congress.
   In picking the six-term Republican from Wyoming, Bush moved
quickly on Friday to fill the void left by the Senate's rejection of
John Tower less than 24 hours earlier.
   And while the announcement caught most political leaders by
surprise, the Cheney choice at once fulfilled two objectives Bush
advisers had cited as critical: someone quickly available and
someone quickly confirmable.
   To allow the politically divisive Tower defeat to fester over the
weekend _ and to be churned over on Sunday television talk shows and
in newspaper columns _ would have not been helpful to the president.
   So far, the move-quick strategy seems to be working. Senate
leaders announced immediately that they would hold confirmation
hearings in the coming week.
   ``Congressman Dick Cheney is well known and highly respected by
the members of the Senate,'' the chairman of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and the panel's ranking
Republican, John Warner of Virginia, said in a joint statement.
   Although Cheney, 48, lacks direct defense experience, he is a
member of the House Intelligence Committee and was senior Republican
on the 15-member special panel that investigated the Iran-Contra
affair.
   Equally important, he served as President Ford's chief of staff.
   In selecting Cheney, whom Bush praised as a ``widely respected
man of principle,'' the president repeated what he had done in
filling many other Cabinet slots _ he reached back and picked
someone whom had served in a previous Republican administration and
with whom he had enjoyed a close working relationship.
   Cheney did not get wind of what was in store until Thursday _ as
the Senate was at work rejecting Tower _ when he got telephone calls
from chief of staff John Sununu and national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft.
   Bush himself didn't contact the candidate until just hours before
the official announcement.
   The president's choice makes sense, said Norman Ornstein, a
political analyst for the Conservative American Enterprise Institute.
   ``You wouldn't have thought of him initially because he's not a
defense specialist. But in terms of respect in Congress, he's near
the top of everyone's list.
   ``If Dick Cheney can't make it through the confirmation process,
no one can,'' Ornstein said. ``Bush had to find someone who could
sail through, and it was a wise choice.''
   Bush himself called Cheney ``a thoughtful man, a quiet man, a
strong man'' who ``approaches public policy with vigor,
determination and diligence.''
   And, judging from early reaction, most members of the Senate
appear to agree. Cheney has few detractors.
   ``I have the greatest respect for his broad range of experience
and knowledge,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a member of the
Senate Armed Services Committee who had been one of Tower's
strongest supporters. ``I look favorably on this nomination and hope
that he will be confirmed expeditiously.''
   ``An excellent choice,'' said Sen. Charles Robb of Virginia, one
of the last Democrats to announce opposition to Tower. ``Unless
there is a complete void in that area (defense), the confirmation
should move rapidly.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine praised Cheney as
a man who ``served with distinction'' in the House and promised
``prompt consideration by the Senate Armed Services Committee and
the full Senate.''
   For his part, Cheney said he had ``extensive views on defense
policy'' and said he was ``eager to get to work.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said there was a
consensus in the White House that the clock was ticking after the
Tower defeat. Bush was being ``encouraged by everyone to do it in a
hurry,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush himself said if he had made a mistake in handling the Tower
nomination, it was the long delay in sending it to the Senate.
   ``So when it became clear (Thursday) that the votes weren't there
... I began to think and talk to my top advisers here, get opinions
from them,'' said Bush.
   And when he finally talked to Cheney at 1 p.m. on Friday, the
president recalled: ``I said I want to make a decision fast on this,
because I know him well and have known him over the years well. And
so ... that's about the way it evolved.''

<TEXT>
   Sabino Augusto Montanaro, the former
Paraguayan interior minister who sought political asylum after the
ouster of President Alfredo Stroessner, arrived in Honduras Saturday
.
   ``I will be permanently grateful to the government and the people
of Honduras,'' Montanaro told reporters at the Tegucigalpa
International Airport.
   Montanaro, 66, sought asylum in the Honduran Embassy in the
Paraguayan capital of Asuncion on Feb. 3 after Stroessner was forced
from office in a bloody coup.
   He left the embassy early Saturday, two days after the new
Paraguayan government granted him a safe-conduct pass to leave the
country.
   Gen. Andres Rodriguez, who led the coup against Stroessner,
dissolved Congress after being sworn in as president and has said
national elections will be held May 1.
   Gen. Stroessner, who ruled Paraguay for 34 years, fled to Brazil
where he is living in exile.
   There were reports that as many as 300 people were killed during
the coup but Rodriguez has said the casualties, including dead and
wounded, did not exceed 50.
   Montanaro's flight on the Brazilian airline Varig left Asuncion
Saturday after a two-hour delay blamed on a false bomb threat.
   He was accompanied by his wife, Martha, his children Augusto and
Silvia, and the Honduran ambassador to Paraguay Roberto Suazo Tome.
   The Honduran government of President Jose Azcona Hoyo made no
comment on Montanaro's arrival.

   An escaped prisoner took six people hostage and
held police at bay for 12 hours with an assault rifle, but died
early Saturday when a fire and gun battle ended the standoff,
officials said.
   Gomard Olayan, 30, released five of the hostages, including a
police officer, and the sixth escaped 10 minutes after a tear gas
cannister started a fire in a second-floor apartment in the Honolulu
suburb of Waipahu.
   Police said it was not immediately clear whether Olayan died in
the fire, during the gunfight or by his own hand. He was armed with
a Soviet-made AK-47 assault rifle, authorities said.
   Olayan fired at least seven bursts of three shots each during the
standoff, said Sgt. Mike Kaainoa. No one was injured by the bullets,
police said.
   The standoff came to a head at 9:25 a.m. with a rapid exchange of
gunfire between Olayan and police. Police then fired tear gas into
the apartment.
   Police decided to open fire because Olayan had been shooting
sporadically out of the apartment throughout the morning, said Maj.
Robert Au, head of the detective division.
   ``We were afraid that some of these shots might injure someone in
the community,'' Au said.
   Olayan and 26-year-old Roy Frisbee escaped from the Oahu
Community Correctional Cetner on Thursday night by taking two guards
hostage with a handgun. Frisbee remained at large Saturday, police
said.
   Both escapees were awaiting trial on numerous charges, including
the illegal possession of firearms and terroristic threatening,
police said.
   Police said Olayan took three children and an adult hostage
around 10 p.m. Friday night. Police said the adult hostage was
Dennis Busano, Olayan's friend and father of the children.
   At 12:15 a.m. Saturday, Olayan released the four hostages in
exchange for a police officer and a man identified by witnesses as
Jonathan Perez, 26.
   Olayan eventually allowed the officer to leave, according to
Roselyn Ginger Wilheln, Perez's girlfriend.
   Perez had a leg amputated last month after a gunshot wound became
infected, according to his girlfriend, Ms. Wilheln said. He was
taken from the apartment by police within 10 minutes of the start of
the fire.
   Police and firefighters found Olayan's body in the bathroom of
the apartment. They entered the apartment at 10:33 a.m., about an
hour after the fire broke out.
   A nursing supervisor at St. Francis Medical Center said Perez was
in good condition. She did not specify Perez's injuries. Police said
Perez was arrested, but did not say what charges he faced.
   Residents of the Nani Gardens apartment complex were evacuated
and spent the night huddled in blankets at a nearby shopping center.

   Barry Levinson, director of the hit autism drama
``Rain Man,'' was selected best director of a feature film by the
Directors Guild of America, as it honored its own at bi-coastal
banquets Saturday.
   Other nominees for the DGA's achievement award for film direction
were Alan Parker of the controversial civil-rights film
``Mississippi Burning''; Robert Zemeckis, who engineered the
animated-live action blockbuster ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit'';
Charles Chrichton, director of the crime-caper comedy ``A Fish
Called Wanda''; and Mike Nichols, who brought the corporate
Cinderella saga ``Working Girl'' to the screen.
   The winner of the prestigious DGA trophy, as selected by the
guild's 9,000 members, almost always repeats as best director in the
Academy Awards. And because the Academy's best-directed film usually
receives the best picture Oscar, the DGA awards hold a special
significance for the film community.
   In the DGA television directing competition, Steve Miner of ABC
was voted best director of a comedy series for the pilot episode of
``The Wonder Years.''
   In other television awards, Marshall Herskovitz was voted best
director of a nighttime dramatic series for the ``Therapy'' episode
of the ABC series ``thirtysomething;'' Lamont Johnson was voted best
director of a dramatic special for his program ``Lincoln'' on NBC;
Jesus Salvador Trevino was voted best director of a dramatic daytime
show for the CBS schoolbreak special ``Gangs;'' Walter C. Miller won
for best director of a musical or variety program for CBS' ``100th
Birthday Celebration (Irving Berlin).''
   Other television awards went to Harry Coyle in sports for
directing NBC's presentation of the 1988 World Series; James Gartner
in commercials for a series of ads, including one for major league
baseball, and Merrill Brockway in documentaries for the PBS Great
Performances program ``On the Move.''
   ABC and CBS had each entered the evening with six nominations
apiece, with ABC's ``thirtysomething'' holding two nominations. NBC
trailed with three nominations in the five television directing
categories.
   The awards were presented Saturday night at New York's Plaza
Hotel, with a separate announcement scheduled to take place at the
Beverly Hills Hotel in California.

   All but one of the DGA nominees _ Zemeckis _ was also nominated
for the best director Oscar. In Zemeckis' place, the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated Martin Scorsese, director
of the much-debated ``The Last Temptation of Christ.''
   With only three exceptions, the DGA award winner has repeated as
the Academy Award winner.
   Steven Spielberg won the 1986 DGA award for ``The Color Purple''
while Syndey Pollack took the best director Oscar for ``Out of
Africa.'' The DGA's 1973 trophy was given to Francis Ford Coppola
for ``The Godfather,'' but Bob Fosse was awarded the Academy Award
for ``Cabaret.'' And in 1969, the DGA selected Anthony Harvey for
``The Lion in Winter'' while the Academy chose Carol Reed for
``Oliver.''
   Bernardo Bertolucci won both the DGA award and the Oscar in 1988
for ``The Last Emperor'' and Oliver Stone doubled in 1987 for
``Platoon.'' Both those films also won the best picture Oscar.
   Earlier this year, Clint Eastwood captured the Golden Globe best
director trophy for ``Bird,'' but he was not among the DGA or Oscar
nominees.
   In other awards competitions this season, the Los Angeles Film
Critics named David Cronenberg best director for ``Dead Ringers,''
the New York Film Critics selected Chris Menges for ``A World
Apart'' and the National Society of Film Critics picked Philip
Kaufman for ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being.''
   As previously announced, Sidney Lumet, director of such films as
``Serpico'' and ``Running on Empty,'' was named an honorary life
member in the DGA.

<HEAD>Sudan Cabinet Resigns to Form Broader Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DALIA BALIGH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has resigned under pressure
from labor unions and the military over its failure to end Sudan's
civil war.
   Newspapers said Sunday the outgoing Cabinet's junior partner, the
fundamentalist National Islamic Front, is expected to stay out of
the next government because of its objection to a proposal to freeze
Islamic law.
   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi handed his Cabinet's resignation late
Saturday to the State Council, the country's collective presidency.
   Ten days earlier, Mahdi and 65 heads of political parties and
unions signed a plan calling for a new government.
   The army, unions, and opposition political groups had issued an
ultimatum to form a broad-based government and start peace talks
with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army in the south.
   There was no word Sunday on when a new government will be named.
   The capital of Khartoum, tense since the army's ultimatum three
weeks ago, was quiet. However, helmeted riot police with shields and
batons stood guard on curbs and street corners.
   The independent daily newspaper Al-Khartoum said Mahdi's new
government will include eight seats for his Umma Party, five for the
centrist Democratic Unionist Party, and two for the powerful trade
unions and professional associations.
   It would be the first time the unions and associations have
shared power since a member of a doctors' group headed a
transitional cabinet for a year after the 1985 overthrow of
long-time dictator Gaafar Nimeiri.
   Al-Khartoum said parties from war-torn southern Sudan would draw
four portfolios, and independent parties and national parties from
western Sudan would get one each.
   The National Islamic Front will not be in the Cabinet, the
newspaper said. The Front has rejected the pact signed 10 days ago
by the other parties.
   The plan calls for immediate endorsement of a peace proposal
reached last November by the rebels and the Democratic Unionists.

<HEAD>2 Guerrillas Killed in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli soldiers killed two Arab guerrillas
early Sunday on the northern border of Israel's self-declared
security zone in southern Lebanon, the army said.
   No Israeli soldiers were hurt in the fighting, an army
announcement said.
   It was the third confrontation between Israeli soldiers and
guerrillas in south Lebanon since February 23. The two other
incidents were described by Israel as PLO attempts to carry out
attacks inside Israel and became an issue in the U.S. dialogue with
the PLO.
   An army announcement referred to the guerrillas as ``terrorists''
but did not indicate if they were Palestinian or Lebanese. A
spokeswoman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she had no
information on whether the guerrillas were trying to infiltrate into
Israel.
   The confrontation in Lebanon took place near the town of Hasbaya,
about five miles north of the Israeli border, the army said.
   Hasbaya is within the security zone set up by Israel to protect
its northern border in 1985 when it withdrew the bulk of its forces
from Lebanon after a three-year occupation.
   Seven Palestinian guerrillas were killed in the two earlier
battles, and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a
Marxist faction of the PLO, said they were members of their group.
   One confrontation took place on Feb. 23, and the second was on
March 2.
   Israel accused the Palestinian group of trying to infiltrate into
Israel in the two previous confrontation and called on the United
States to halt its dialogue with the PLO, saying PLO chief Yasser
Arafat had broken his pledge to stop terrorist attacks.
   U.S. officials criticized the PLO for the incidents, but it also
called for a halt to retaliatory Israeli bombing raids against
Palestinian positions in south Lebanon.

   Six protesters dressed as trees went to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's residence Sunday to urge her government
to do more to protect the world's rain forests.
   The members of the United Nations Association Youth Council
delivered 22 chestnut saplings, one for each member of the Cabinet,
and a letter welcoming the government's recent support for saving
the ozone layer.
   ``We are glad the government is concerned about the ozone layer
but we want to see more action on the crucial environmental question
of the destruction of the rain forests,'' said the council's
chairman, David Kennedy.
   ``Saving the rain forests is as crucial as saving the ozone
layer.''
   Britain was the host of a 120-nation conference last week that
ended with industrialized nations reaffirming plans to ban by the
end of the century synthetic chemicals known as chlorofluorocarbons.
   The compounds destroy the ozone shield that protects the Earth
from the sun's cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.

   Students and workers demanding the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo battled hundreds of riot police
with firebombs, clubs and rocks Sunday after they were blocked from
marching into the streets.
   Armored police vans with multiple tear gas launchers fired
volleys of choking gas into the crowds around Yonsei University in
eastern Seoul.
   ``Oust Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Thrust a knife into the Roh regime!''
protesters shouted as they charged police and pelted them with rocks
and firebombs that spewed blazing gasoline.
   About 2,000 troopers hurled rocks back as dense clouds of white
tear gas cloaked the campus.
   Police said some officers were injured, but they had no figures.
They did not report any arrests.
   The violence erupted when protesters tried to march out of Yonsei
after about 10,000 workers, dissidents and students held a campus
rally to denounce the Roh government and demand free labor unions.
South Korean law restricts some trade union activity.
   In speeches, dissident leaders bitterly attacked the Roh
government and big corporations that dominate the South Korean
economy. Speakers said the government and corporations were
subjecting people to lives of endless work and poverty.
   ``Rise up and march forth to let out our anger at the
suppressors,'' dissident leader Paik Ki-wan said as thousands
cheered and clapped.
   Thousands of protesters then marched to the school's main gate,
beating drums and jabbing their fists into the air.
   Protesters burned an effigy of Chung Ju-yong, founder of Hyundai
Corp., the nation's biggest company. Police broke up a protest at
the company's Seoul headquarters last week.
   Some students armed with clubs and firebombs then surged out of
several gates and climbed over the school's walls to attack riot
police blocking the way. Most protesters stayed on the campus and
did not attack police.
   The clash, one of the biggest anti-government protests in South
Korea in recent months, was confined to the main road in front of
the school and lasted about one hour.
   Riot police guarded government buildings and the Hyundai
headquarters in central Seoul to prevent attacks. There were no
reports of any incidents.
   Dissidents and radical students claim Roh is a front for military
rule and seek the overthrow of his government. Dissident leaders say
they want to end the domination of the government bureaucracy, the
military and big industrial corporations.
   Roh, a former general who took office in February 1988, has
introduced broad democratic reforms. But many South Koreans oppose
his government because of its ties to past authoritarian regimes.
   The dissidents have little public support, but they have been
showing new strength following the formation in January of a new
anti-government alliance. The anti-government students back the
alliance.

   About 70 British troops arrived Sunday
to join the advance contingent of U.N. peacekeepers preparing to
monitor Namibia's transition to independence.
   The British unit brought its own four-wheel drive vehicles and
drove in convoy to its temporary quarters, a South African army base
south of Windhoek. Tents reserved for the Britons had no mattresses
on the beds, and South African officers began a search to find some.
   Soldiers and U.N. administrative personnel from Australia,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Kenya, Poland, and Spain already
are in Namibia. Some 4,650 troops from more than 20 countries are to
arrive by the end of the month.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since World War I, is to
begin implementing independence next month, leading to elections in
early November.
   The South-West African People's Organization, which has waged a
guerrllia war against South African rule here for 23 years, is
favored to win most votes. It needs two-thirds of ballots to have
full control of a government.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the Soviet Union's longest-waiting
refuseniks, Yuli Kosharovsky, arrived in Israel to a festive welcome
Sunday after an 18-year struggle to gain his freedom.
   ``We welcome you with open arms and with a heart full of hope
that many, many of our brothers in the Soviet Union will come in
your footsteps,'' Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said as he greeted
Kosharovsky at the airport.
   Choking back tears, the refusenik said in Hebrew: ``All my life,
my greatest ambition has been to be an Israeli.''
   He said more than half a million of the Soviet Union's 2.5
million Jews would prefer to leave.
   In February, 2,425 Jews left the Soviet Union, but only 13
percent went to Israel. Most chose the United States.
   Kosharovsky, 48, arrived in Israel with his wife Ina, 42, and
their three children.
   Kosharovsky was a leading Hebrew teacher in the Soviet Union and
was arrested six times for his Zionist activities.
   He first was refused an emigration visa in March 1971 and applied
22 times before he got permision to leave.

   Soldiers backed by helicopter gunships
battled communist guerrillas in a southern Philippine town, leaving
17 people dead, the military reported Sunday.
   The army report did not identify those killed Thursday in clashes
in Lupon town, 634 miles southeast of Manila.
   The first clash, with 50 New People's Army rebels, lasted two
hours, the report said. Thirty minutes later, other soldiers from
the same battalion encountered about 200 rebels near the same site,
it said.
   Helicopter gunships fired rockets at rebel positions in the
second battle, which lasted five hours, the report said.
   In Manila, a bomb exploded outside the residence of Moslem Sen.
Mamintal Tamano just before midnight Saturday.
   It shattered windows but caused only minor injuries to a
neighbor, police said.
   Kao Ayo, a secretary of the Tamano family, said Tamano had no
idea who planted the bomb. ``The senator said he has no enemies,''
she said.
   Tamano is one of two Moslems in the 23-member senate. Five
million of the country's 62 million people are Moslems living mostly
in the southern Philippines, where Moslem separatist guerrillas have
been fighting for self-rule for more than a decade.

   Army troops in vehicles mounted with
machine guns patrolled this seaport Sunday after roving gunmen
killed five people and wounded at least seven, officials said.
   Rival student groups at Karachi University traded gunfire from
windows and rooftops for hours Saturday. The Edhi Trust ambulance
service said three students were wounded, none seriously.
   Police and witnesses said that since Friday, there have been
several incidents in which young men fired indiscriminately from
cars and motorcycles, killing at least five people.
   Officials said the attacks appeared to be random and that no
group claimed responsibility.
   Army troops were dispatched to enforce a curfew in violence-prone
districts of east and west Karachi.
   The city of 9 million, Pakistan's largest, has frequently been
the site of clashes between ethnic Moslem natives and those who
immigrated from India.
   Saturday's shooting at Karachi University involved students of a
fundamentalist Moslem party and of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's
Pakistan People's Party.
   The sniping lasted from about noon to sunset. The campus was
reported quiet Sunday.

<HEAD>A Woman's Voice Will Count Down the Final Seconds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since Alan B. Shepard made his
15-minute suborbital flight aboard the Mercury capsule Freedom 7 in
1961, counting down the final seconds to launch has been a man's job.
   On Monday, Lisa Malone changes all that.
   The 27-year-old public affairs specialist with NASA at the
Kennedy Space Center will replace Hugh Harris as the voice of
Shuttle Launch Control for the liftoff of Discovery. It will be the
first time a woman has served as launch commentator for a flight
carrying astronauts.
   Her job will be to guide the news media and the public through
the anxious minutes before the main engines ignite in a burst of
flame and smoke, until the shuttle clears the launch tower and
communications switch to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Her challenge to explain what is taking place behind the scenes
and to translate the technical chatter among launch managers into
``something that anybody can understand.''
   Malone is quick to contrast the significance of her new role with
that of female astronauts.
   ``I think what they're doing is a lot more trendsetting and
important than what a commentator does,'' she said, ``because
they're actually doing it instead of reporting on what's been done.''
   Nevertheless, Malone said, she likes to think her voice will be
an inspiration to young women.
   ``If that would inspire somebody to go on and achieve what they
want in life,'' she says, ``I think that is fantastic.''
   Malone has worked for NASA for seven years, rising to her
position of space shuttle specialist from a college work-study
program that started while she was earning a bachelor's degree in
journalism from the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa.
   She edited the space center newsletter, Spaceport News, for three
years before she was assigned to the space shuttle beat. Now, she
attends several daily meetings of launch managers to stay up-to-date
on the progress of work to get three orbiters and their external
fuel tanks and booster rockets ready for flight.
   To prepare for her debut, Malone provided launch commentary for
some unmanned Atlas Centaur and Delta launches and for the early
portions of some shuttle countdowns. She has watched numerous
launches from her seat at the firing room console beside Harris, who
is now deputy director for public affairs at Kennedy Space Center.
   She also hired a voice coach.
   Although she has learned the lingo and has carefully prepared a
script, Malone knows her biggest challenge will be the ``real-time
element of the job'' _ and how she'll react if there's an unexpected
problem during the countdown.
   ``You're going to be scrambling to try and figure out what it is
because you want to have the right story before you tell the world
what's going on,'' Malone said.

<TEXT>
   Jokes by fellow train passengers about
his cowboy garb and holstered revolver prompted a Swiss man to prove
the gun was real, police said Sunday.
   The 32-year-old man fired into the train's ceiling and through a
compartment door. After leaving the train, he put a final shot
through the window of a train station toilet, a police statement
said.
   No injuries were reported.
   Police detectives arrested the man but did not disclose his name
or address except to say he was from outside Zurich.
   He said he was inspired by the Western movie ``High Noon'' and
bought his outfit for a country music festival in Zurich, according
to police.
   Police reported on the Feb. 26 incident after authorities charged
the man with endangering life, property damage and illegal
possession of a weapon.

   Time passes slowly for Stefania Follini.
   The Italian woman has fallen into a routine of staying awake 23
hours, then sleeping for 10, after being holed up in a cave for two
months as part of a research project into the effects of isolation.
She has no sun, radios or clocks to guide her sense of time, and
little contact with other humans.
   ``Sunday, Feb. 12, 10 a.m.,'' Miss Follini writes on a computer
at a desk in her plastic habitat at one end of the cave.
   Actually, it's noon on Wednesday, March 8.
   On Jan. 13, the 27-year-old Miss Follini climbed 30 feet below
the earth's surface and into the 200-foot-long Lost Cave in the
hills west of Carlsbad to begin a four- to five-month isolation
experiment. An Italian research group is sponsoring the experiment,
along with various U.S. universities and the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   As she moves about in her two-room, 200-square-foot Plexiglas
house, Miss Follini resembles a laboratory rat in a cage.
   Researchers monitor her with three video cameras and microphones,
and they type in occasional messages to her computer, but Miss
Follini cannot see or hear another human.
   During her waking hours, she sometimes taps away at her computer
like a subject in a B.F. Skinner experiment as researchers in a
trailer above record the results of tests of her concentration,
memory and reasoning ability.
   One thing researchers are discovering in isolation experiments _
intended, among other things, to give them insight into how humans
might react on interplanetary space flights _ is that men tend to be
more cheerful in long isolation than women.
   Maurizio Montalbini, the experiment coordinator who once spent
six months isolated in a cave, alludes to that in a brief computer
conversation in Italian with his fellow native of Ancona, Italy.
   ``You should change your sex,'' Montalbini writes to the
glum-looking Miss Follini. ``You always seem like a sad one.''
   ``I feel sadder some times than others,'' she replies.
   After chatting via computer for a little bit, Montalbini asks
Miss Follini to take the series of computerized mental tests, which
she performs about once a week. Miss Follini, who had been
interrupted from reading a novel to take the medical measurements
and relay them by computer, becomes a little sarcastic.
   ``Great idea, like a dessert!'' she responds.
   An interior decorator by profession, Miss Follini has livened up
her 10-by-10-foot living area with colorful figures cut out of
construction paper and glued to the walls. Among the paper
decorations: wine bottles, a flower box and a ``window,'' covered
with blue paper lace curtains, that looks out onto a white paper
moon and stars. A brown paper cat sits beside the windowsill.
   Miss Follini spends much of her time kneeling on a blue mat,
reading. She brought 400 books with her: novels, histories, English
primers. She stays in shape by practicing judo moves.
   She is remarkably quiet.
   Even though researchers can hear her, she prefers to communicate
with them by computer.
   She does talk a little to her pets _ two mice she dubbed Giuseppe
and Nicoleta, and a salamander _ all found in the cave. She keeps a
vigil to prevent the rodents from gnawing at cables or eating her
food, which consists mostly of rice and beans she cooks on an
electric stove.
   Long-term space flight might be a lot like this, except for the
lack of gravity in space.
   Medical researchers are especially interested in finding out what
isolation does to one's emotional and mental well-being.
   ``Stefania is fine,'' says Andrea Galvagno, an Italian doctor who
alternates 24-hour monitoring shifts with Montalbini. ``As of now,
she hasn't expressed any desire that deals with the outside world.''
   But it appears Miss Follini's world isn't quite a utopia. She
occasionally attaches electrodes to her head before she falls asleep
so researchers can study her brain waves in various stages of sleep,
and the results show symptoms of mild depression.
   Galvagno says he and Montalbini sometimes joke around with Miss
Follini to buoy her spirits.
   Montalbini says Miss Follini's ability to concentrate has
deteriorated. In previous experiments, people in isolation alone
have improved their concentration, while members of groups isolated
in caves have lost their concentration.
   About this time, around 4:30 p.m., Miss Follini walks over to her
computer, types in ``Ciaoooooooo,'' waves to the video camera, dims
the lights _ they always stay on _ lies on the mat under a blanket
and stares at the camera a while.
   Presently she closes her eyes and falls asleep: Stefania Follini,
a brown paper cat, two mice and a salamander.

<HEAD>Plan to Publish `Mein Kamph' in Hebrew Stirs Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Holocaust survivor's Hebrew translation of
``Mein Kampf'' has touched off a controversy over whether the book,
which inspired the slaughter of 6 million Jews, should be published
in Israel.
   Author Dan Yaron argued Sunday that a Hebrew edition of the Adolf
Hitler's manifesto will educate young Israelis about the evils of
the Nazi regime. Other Holocaust survivors say it should never
appear on Israeli bookshelves.
   So far, Yaron has not found a publisher.
   ``It's not easy to get someone to publish a book that is
connected to Hitler,'' said Yaron, who spent the past 18 months
translating the first volume of ``Mein Kampf.''
   ``But 50 years after Hitler, we must be strong enough to look at
who he was,'' said Yaron, who fled his native Vienna in 1938 after
watching Nazi troops parade down the main street of the Austrian
capital.
   Yaron, a retired educator, said in an interview that young Jews
should read ``Mein Kampf'' as a warning against racist ideology. He
said, for example, that there were disturbing anti-Arab sentiments
expressed by extreme right Israeli politicians.
   ``The new generation needs ... to know about the dangers that can
occur,'' he said. ``There are (Israelis) who promote racism.''
   Yaron said the fact his parents were killed by the Nazis while
trying to escape from Austria has strengthened his determination to
see the book published in Israel.
   ``If people like my father ... would have had the internal
strength to read the book, they would have known, and things would
have ended differently,'' he said.
   Other Holocaust refugees vehemently disagree with Yaron, saying
publication would stir deep emotion in a nation that was founded in
part to shelter the survivors of the Nazi horrors.
   If it is published, ``there will be battles in the street,''
predicted Noah Klieger, a survivor of the Aushwitz concentration
camp, who covers Holocaust affairs for the daily Yediot Ahronot
newspaper.
   ``We need freedom of opinion, but there is a limit, and Hitler is
the limit,'' he said in an interview. ``The man who wrote this book
destroyed _ physically destroyed _ a third of the Jewish people.''
   Stefan Grayek, president of the World Federation of Jewish
Fighters, Partisans, and Camp Inmates, also opposes publication.
   ``Jews don't need to read about the worst anti-Semitism the world
has ever seen,'' he said. ``We don't need to revive Hitler,
certainly not in Israel, definitely not in Hebrew.''
   He said some Holocaust survivors were considering legal action to
stop publication. But he said the federation decided against doing
anything, believing there was no real interest in the book.
   If published, he said, ``I think ...the book will end up in a
warehouse and not people's bookshelves,'' Grayek said.
   The Yad Vashem national Holocaust memorial has refused a request
to publish the translation, a spokesman for Yad Vashem said.
   ``I question why anyone would publish the book,'' said spokesman
Menahem Fogel. ``It's going to upset a lot of people, and I can't
see it selling a lot of copies.''
   ``The book is available in its original language, and if
researchers want to gain access to the book it is best that they
study it in the original language,'' he said.

   The permit owners listed such problems as claustrophobia,

   More than 3,000 union members
and supporters held a rally and marched in front of the Boise

   The union members, from across Minnesota, North Dakota and

more than double production at this town on the Canadian border.
   ``The fact of the matter is that organized labor is going to

Saturday's rally.
   A Boise Cascade spokesman defended the hiring of non-union labor.

   An 81-year-old man struck a bank robber
with a karate-style chop after seeing him hit a female teller,
causing the robber to drop a bag of money and flee, authorities said.
   ``I don't believe in hitting ladies,'' said the elderly customer,
who asked not to be identified.
   The robber scooped up some $10 and $20 bills from the floor, but
left most of the money behind Friday as he ran out of a BancOhio
National Bank branch on the city's south side, said police Detective
Ted Shaw.
   Shaw said the robber handed a note demanding money to the teller
Friday afternoon. The robber said he had a gun, but no weapon was

   ``She (the teller) complied, but apparently it wasn't fast enough

   That was when the elderly customer at the next window punched the
robber.
   ``I didn't give it a thought,'' the man said. ``I just hit that
man because he hit that woman.''
   Police refused to disclose the amount taken. No one had been
arrested in the robbery by early Sunday.

<TEXT>
   When Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn came under
Republican attack during the debate over John Tower's nomination as
defense secretary, Majority Leader George Mitchell stepped forward
to deflect the blows.
   And when the Republicans switched gears and insisted that the key
issue was President Bush's prerogative of picking his own Cabinet,
Mitchell deftly rebutted by cautioning against
``self-righteousness.''
   ``Don't get too locked into your present views,'' the Maine
senator said after reciting chapter and verse a series of past GOP
votes against high-level Democratic appointees. ``You may get into
another one in not too long.''
   If George Bush had much at stake in the Tower fight that
culminated with rejection of the nomination, so did George Mitchell,
a 55-year-old Maine native of Maine whose rise to the pinnacle of
power in the Senate has been extremely rapid by congressional
standards. A former federal judge who was appointed to office in
1980, he won an underdog's race for a six-year term in 1982 and
parlayed that into a landslide re-election in 1988.
   He presided over the Democratic campaign committee that helped
oust the Republican majority in 1986 and two years later he won a
three-way race to become majority leader. He has stressed
cooperation with Bush in the early months of his tenure, yet also
outlined a Democratic agenda that includes ethics legislation,
environmental concerns and social issues such as raising the minimum
wage.
   Still, a miscue could have marred his first appearance in a
leading role for a party trying to maintain its standing during
lengthy Republican control of the White House.
   Mitchell walked a narrow line. He stressed throughout the debate
that he meant no political injury to Bush. Yet he also was the
careful keeper of the vote count that sealed Tower's rejection.
   He put his low-key debating style on display for the first time
in contrast to veteran GOP leader Bob Dole's more aggressive
approach.
   Moreover, Mitchell apparently emerged without unduly antagonizing
senators on the other side of the aisle.
   Dole said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that the Senate
probably will be back to normal within a month or two despite
bruised feelings over the Tower episode.
   ``I think you can say that the nomination is gone but not
forgotten,'' said Dole. ``The memories will be around for a while.
There will be some bruised feelings. But I think in probably 30 to
60 days we'll be back to normal. The scars aren't that deep.''
   One Democratic committee chairman, speaking anonymously, said
Mitchell's approach was to avoid the appearance of partisanship, yet
at the same time to support Nunn and the Democrats on the Armed
Services Committee who recommended rejection of Tower's nomination.
   ``I thought he acted calm and cool throughout. He made nobody mad
on the Democratic side,'' said Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., one of
three Democrats to vote in favor of confirmation. ``He never did any
real what you call arm-twisting.''
   In the same vein, Mitchell minimized the importance of the Tower
debate to his own political fortunes even as he acknowledged
judgments ``inevitably'' would be made on how he performed.
   After initially remaining in the background, Mitchell assumed an
increasingly prominent role in the confirmation struggle.
   Mitchell learned Monday night that the votes were in hand to
defeat Tower's nomination, and let the Republicans know by telling
reporters on Tuesday.
   The following day _ Wednesday _ Democrat Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
became the third Democrat to announce his support of Tower. But then
a string of three wavering Democrats quickly came to the floor and
declared their opposition. The effect was to blunt the impact of
Bentsen's long-awaited decision and seal Tower's defeat. It all bore
the marks of skillful behind-the-scenes stage managing.
   Mitchell and Nunn worked closely and several Republicans said it
was the decision by the highly respected Nunn to oppose Tower that
made confirmation difficult to achieve.
   Yet when Nunn himself came under attack from Republicans for
detailing investigators from a subcommittee he heads to check out
allegations against Tower, Mitchell came to his defense.
   ``We are not going to get in a position here where one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven people come over here and ask the same
question and the senator (Nunn) has to give the same answer over
again,'' said Mitchell.
   And he showcased his debating skills when he replied to
persistent Repulican claims that Bush was entitled to have the
nomination confirmed as a matter of presidential prerogative.
   If they serve long enough, he said, all senators of both parties
``will inevitably contradict ourselves. We will meet ourselves
coming around the corner on some issue.''
   He cited Repulican opposition to several appointments made by
former President Carter a decade ago and said: ``There was no talk
then about the president having his own way. There was no talk then
about the president winning the last election. There was no talk
then about the future of the confirmation process. There was no talk
then about the fairness of the process.''
   Mitchell also worked to thwart Dole's more aggressive approach to
the debate and his efforts to shake loose a few extra votes by
accusing the Democrats of treating Tower unfairly.
   When Dole suggested that Tower be given the right to come to the
Senate and respond to allegations against him, Mitchell immediately
replied that he would be willing to give it serious consideration.
By not rejecting the proposal outright, several Democrats said, the
Maine senator denied Dole the right to level a fresh charge of
unfairness.
   And when Dole finally made a formal proposal on the Senate floor
_ after the outcome of the struggle was clear _ Mitchell blocked it
and the Republicans did not pursue it.

   The spotlight of the John Tower controversy
proved hotter than Sam Nunn had anticipated and the Georgia senator
now yearns for a chance to lower his profile.
   ``I'd like to go down to Houston County and check titles on real
estate for about six months,'' Nunn told reporters at the annual
meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council.
   The reporters laughed and the senator smiled. But he looked like
a man who meant what he said.
   Like it or not, Nunn will have to reconcile himself to a
prominence most politicians would relish.
   For the first time in his public career, Nunn was the target of
partisan attacks from opponents who questioned his tactics and
motives as the leader of the opposition to the Tower nomination.
   It was a trial by fire that seems to have strengthened his
standing as a national figure. President Bush may not like the role
Nunn played in defeating his first choice to head the Pentagon, but
the president seemed as eager as Nunn to get the bitterness behind
him.
   Before the Tower debate, Nunn was seen as a figure apart from
politics. ``Respected'' was the word most often used to describe the
bespectacled Georgian who had carved out a reputation as the
Senate's foremost authority on defense issues.
   The past couple of years saw a shift in Nunn's approach. No
longer did he shy away from partisan jabs at the Republican
administration. He mulled a run for the 1988 Democratic presidential
nomination and campaigned extensively for Michael Dukakis in his
ill-fated effort to regain the presidency for the Democrats.
   But the Tower nomination was a much more dramatic step into the
thick of partisan politics. That battle over, the question he often
is asked is, what next?
   ``I have no plans or any inclination to run for president in
1992,'' he said. ``I'd like to have s much lower profile.''
   As chairman of the DLC, Nunn had the kind of forum he seems to
relish _ one that features an often dry discussions of issues.
   Without question, Nunn was the dominant figure at the two-day
meeting, despite the presence of three of the contenders for the
1988 Democratic presidential nomination _ Jesse Jackson, Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri.
   ``When the history of the 101st Congress is written, it will be
about Sam Nunn,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of
Maine. ``He represents the best that our democratic society has to
offer.''
   Mitchell's tribute to Nunn was all the more striking for being
just one of many voiced during the conference.
   But while Nunn was bombarded with the sort of flattery that would
prompt most politicians to begin thinking about their Cabinet
choices, a bid for the presidency would make the fight over Tower
seem gentle.
   Nunn represents his party's most conservative wing.
   While he commands unquestioned respect on defense issues his
support for the Reagan economic program would and his conservative
positions on other domestic issues would raise bitter opposition
from the party activists who still control the presidential
nominating process.
   The ideological split in the Democratic Party was dramatized by
the presence at the DLC meeting of Jackson, who symbolizes an
approach the DLC was created to combat.
   ``Reverend Jackson is a very credible spokesman for his point of
view,'' said Nunn. ``Obviously, he and I have some very fundamental
differences in philosophy.''
   Those differences will not easily be bridged.

   Its name is virtually synonymous with
planning. But 25 years after its founding as America's first planned
city, Columbia belatedly is allowing for the one thing besides taxes
that everyone must face _ death.
   Burying the dead wasn't on the minds of Rouse Co. officials in
1963 when they purchased 15,000 acres of farmland and mapped out a
city of the future. Consultants on recreation, education, sociology
and other fields were hired to prescribe ideal living conditions for
urbanites weary of depersonalized existence in Washington's
metropolitan sprawl.
   But somehow, with its focus on living well, Columbia never made
provisions for what comes afterward. This city of 70,500 souls had
no cemetery.
   ``My understanding is that it was overlooked in the beginning.
(Rouse Co. founder James) Rouse had very detailed plans. ... He
hired all kinds of experts. The one expert he forgot was a cemetery
expert,'' said Harvey Geller, who is one.
   Last year, The Rouse Co. turned over 28 acres in Columbia to
Geller and assigned him to create a graveyard.
   Last Monday, Geller watched as the first burial took place.
   ``We had enough road to accommodate them, luckily. We've only
cleared about five acres,'' Geller said.
   In fact, there isn't much to see of the Columbia Memorial Park _
just a circular driveway inside a low, curving stone wall. So far,
about 20 plots have been sold and two funerals have been held.
   Columbia's organizers have had little time to think about final
resting places. Amenities of gracious living that are in place or on
the drawing board include playgrounds, bike and jogging paths, a
shopping mall, cultural centers, an athletic club, golf course,
community pools and a bowling alley.
   In the 1960s, the city _ built in rural Howard County 20 miles
north of Washington _ acquired a reputation for addressing urban
problems through innovative, comprehensive planning.
   Columbia, which welcomed its first residents in 1967, is seeing
its population graying. The people who bought houses in Columbia in
their 30s and 40s are approaching retirement.
   About 60 percent of Howard County's senior citizens now live in
Columbia or in nearby Ellicott City, said Bob Callahan, executive
director of the Florence Bain Senior Center in Columbia. ``It was
built as a young persons' city, but what happened was the old folks
came to live near their kids,'' Callahan said.
   Al Scavo, a Rouse vice president who is overseeing the cemetery,
said it has taken two decades for a graveyard to become economically
feasible. ``I'm not sure it was overlooked. The market wasn't
here,'' he said.
   It's still not clear how large that market is. As they approach
their twilight years, even residents who love Columbia apparently
are not anxious to stay there eternally.
   The Rev. Tom Golueke of St. John's Catholic Church said none of
the 2,400 families in his parish has mentioned a desire to be buried
in Columbia.
   But having a cemetery in the community ``does give people some
type of roots,'' the priest said. ``I guess you know you've made it
as a city when you have a cemetery.''
   Columbia residents began to talk about a cemetery in the 1970s,
but no developer was interested. Rouse finally ended up doing the
first phase of construction itself and giving the land to Geller to
manage, Scavo said.
   The cemetery is expected to be able to support itself after the
25,000 graves are sold, probably in about 50 years. Cemeteries rely
on trust funds financed by plot sales to pay for perpetual
maintenance.
   The company _ a stickler for design rules _ had its own ideas
about how the tract was to look. Statues, elaborate mausoleums, even
simple white crosses were ruled out. Graves will be marked by bronze
plates set in the ground, with nothing above ground except
landscaping, a small chapel in a grove, and a communal mausoleum.
   Gail Saunier, executive director of the Columbia Forum, a citizen
watchdog group, said she thinks the cemetery's time has come.
   ``It was the one thing we didn't have,'' she said. ``If you feel
strongly about your community, you may want (to be buried there). I
think a lot of people do, and I think that will increase as Columbia
gets older.''

   A new government publication tries to fix the
proper name on every species of fish that might end up on an
American's plate so one diner's striped bass will no longer be
another's rockfish.
   Just off the government's presses is ``The Fish List: FDA Guide
to Acceptable Market Names for Food Fish Sold in Interstate
Commerce,'' intended to end the confusion that arises because fishes
swim under so many aliases.
   The book assigns a market name to each fish from sea, stream or
lake that is sold in America and gives the scientifically-acceptable
common name for each. It also tells how the fish is known locally,
often by different names in different places.
   Fish dealers may sell their wares under either market name or
common name, but none other.
   What some people call the Boston mackerel and others call the
common mackerel and still others know as the caballa, the booklet
shows, are all one fish with the scientific Latin name Scomber
scombrus.
   Scomber scombrus may be sold simply as mackerel, its market name,
or as Atlantic mackerel, its science-accepted common name.
   The booklet lists 1,042 species, all fish sold for food in the
United States.
   But, admits fish list compiler Mary Snyder, assistant to the
director of the Division of Regulatory Guidance at the Food and Drug
Administration, ``I have missed many. I get calls every day about
fish that aren't on the list.''
   Rockfish illustrate the name problem.
   ``People in the mid-Atlantic area call striped bass rockfish,''
said Mrs. Snyder.
   ``To the rest of the country the rockfish is a completely
different fish,'' she said. ``It is related to ocean perch, which is
a rough looking fish _ squatty and with rough scales and spiny fins.
What we here in the Washington area call a rockfish is cigar-shaped,
has stripes and is very different.''
   The government has long required the marketing of fish under
uniform, government-accepted names.
   What's new is the guidebook. It was produced by the FDA and the
Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service because,
Mrs. Snyder said, fish dealers who called for guidance sometimes got
inconsistent answers.
   What ``The Fish List'' establishes is how species with delicious
commercial names are sometimes known locally by names so unappealing
that anyone would be tempted to toss them back.
   Take the fish known to science as the Lethrinus spp. Its
commercial name is emperor, but it is known in some places as the
longnosed pigfaced bream, elsewhere as the rosefaced pigface bream
and in yet other places as the mu.
   What is sold as the grunt is known in some places as the brown
sweetlips. Some people call some anchovies the smig. Others call the
grenadier the rattail.
   Uniform commercial names combat marketplace deception. About a
month ago, the government seized 45,672 pounds of frozen fish
fillets imported from New Zealand. They arrived labeled orange
roughy, a tasty, expensive fish, when in fact they were merely the
smooth oreo dory, a cheaper fish.
   The book lists 24 species of croaker, 38 of snapper, 18 of eel,
62 of rockfish, 31 of grouper, 15 of grunt, 21 of anchovy, 34 of
shark, and 21 of mackerel _ including the jack mackerel, chub
mackerel, king mackerel, snake mackerel and the Japanese scad, Inca
scad or rough scad. These scads are mackerels, no matter what
they're called.
   When the consumer buys flounder, he may be buying peacock
flounder one time, tropical flounder another time _ or panther
flounder, Bering flounder, yellowtail flounder, Arctic flounder or
any of 35 other species of flounder.
   It doesn't matter, said Mrs. Snyder. They are so much alike in
taste and appearance that the customer wouldn't know the difference.
Only another flounder could tell one from another.

   Some people think they have space problems when
the hall closet won't take one more winter coat or when there's no
more room in the attic for grandma's collection of National
Geographics.
   That's nothing.
   The Field Museum of Natural History is trying to cope with 2
million beetles, 9.6 million insect specimens, 1.7 million fish,
381,000 birds, 2.4 million plants, a half-million fossils, 600,000
artifacts _ 20 million specimens in all with 400,000 more coming in
each year.
   ``We're approaching a sort of gridlock,'' said the museum's
geology department chairman, John Bolt.
   The botany department bulges with twice as many plant specimens
as it was designed to hold. And the geology department is cramming
so many fossils into storage drawers that some may get damaged.
   The museum, which says its holdings are widely used by
researchers, is planning to close two courtyards inside the building
for construction of more storage, and is considering building four
underground, two-story vaults.

   Organizers of the first St. Patrick's
Day parade here nine years ago weren't sure how popular it would be,
since South Dakota is populated mainly by descendants of
Scandinavians and Germans.
   But ``good Lord, they came out of the woodwork,'' says Bill
Reynolds, who helped plan event back in 1980. Organizers had figured
on maybe 20 parade entries. They got more than 350.
   Thousands of revelers are expected to converge on Sioux Falls
again Friday to celebrate what has become one of the city's most
popular holidays.
   Sylvia Henkin, chairwoman and owner of KSOO Radio Inc., was
instrumental in planning the first Sioux Falls parade.
   ``They called me the Jewish leprechaun,'' she recalls.
   She's not sure why the idea caught on, but she says the bitter
South Dakota winters may have had something to do with it.
   ``I think people sort of have cabin fever in this part of the
country after being winterized and locked up,'' she said. ``All you
need is a good excuse to celebrate and, my goodness, this is a good
excuse.''
   ``This thing has taken off by itself and mushroomed,'' Henkin
said. ``Really, the only thing we would need to do is blow a whistle
and it would take off by itself.''

   Pauline Hobgood and Raymond Smith married
more than 60 years ago and were divorced a quarter-century ago.
Smith, 81, remarried once and Ms. Hobgood, 80, remarried twice.
   But they remained friends, and on Saturday they were married
again in a ceremony before dozens of relatives and friends in the
Dumas Nursing Center.
   ``They're making my brother and I very happy by remarrying,''
said Norma Jean Stewart, the couple's daughter. ``The family has
always hoped they would get back together.''
   The ring used in the wedding was the same one Smith gave to Ms.
Hobgood in 1928.
   ``After the divorce, Mother always wore the ring on her right
hand,'' Stewart said.
   Ms. Hobgood said she and Smith ``never lost touch with each
other. One time, I even kept his money for him while he was in the
hospital.''
   Several days before the wedding, residents and staff members gave
Ms. Hobgood a bridal shower. The male residents, not to be outdone,
treated Smith to a bachelor party.

   Democrats in Congress didn't wait long to call
President Bush on his promise to raise the minimum wage.
   Democrats who saw their attempt to raise the $3.35 an hour wage
floor founder last year have renewed it with greater resolve,
setting up an early confrontation with Bush on a domestic issue that
reaches deep into the wallets of millions of Americans.
   Bush insists he will veto what may become the first piece of
major legislation to reach his desk if it doesn't match his plan,
despite agreeing that the minimum should be raised for the first
time in eight years.
   ``$4.25, that's it,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole told a
Senate committee earlier this month, drawing a line she says Bush
will not cross.
   But Democrats are putting their more ambitious increase on the
``fast track,'' using the minimum wage to take the lead on domestic
legislation after eight years of frustration under President Reagan.
   ``We're going to get this legislation achieved,'' said Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee. ``If it's the judgment that (Bush will) veto
it, we'll override it.''
   Quick action in the House and Senate _ and the concession by
Democrats that a sub-minimum wage they have long considered poison
could be part of a compromise _ has sparked hopes the minimum will
be raised for the first time since 1981.
   ``An increase in the minimum wage for the nation's lowest paid
employees is long overdue, and it is well past time for Congress to
act,'' Kennedy said earlier this month.
   Kennedy's committee recently passed his plan to raise the minimum
to $4.65 in three annual stages and a House subcommittee approved a
virtually identical plan on Thursday.
   The dollar difference is this: Democrats would take the minimum
to $3.85 an hour immediately and then add 40 cents a year for the
following two years. Bush would add 30 cents an hour annually for
three years.
   The main political battleground, however, is over Bush's desire
to add a second tier to leave the minimum at $3.35 an hour for the
first six months of employment for all newly hired workers. Bush
calls it a ``training wage,'' although opponents deride the term
because there are no requirements for any training.
   Kennedy, long opposed to a second scale, said last week he'd be
``glad to listen'' to a limited version.
   But he added, ``I'm not going to see the corruption of the
minimum wage by using the words `training wage' to throw older
workers out of work and displace those who want to work 40 hours a
week.''
   Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., chairman of the House labor standards
subcommittee, said he was drawing up his own version of the reduced
wage as an alternative to the Republican plan and may introduce it
on the House floor. An aide said Murphy is looking at a duration of
30 to 90 days for a sub-minimum, and would likely tie it to a
percentage of the standard minimum.
   Labor Department figures show slightly fewer than 4 million
people work for the minimum wage, about 15 percent of them heads of
households. Some 11 million others earn less than $4.55 an hour,
according to a report on the raise that failed last year, and so
could see fatter paychecks if the minimum is boosted.
   The last time the rate was raised was in 1978, when it was
boosted in four stages that ended with the $3.35 an hour standard in
1981.
   ``Inflation has eroded the current minimum by 38 percent,''
Kennedy said. The administration's plan would eventually raise the
minimum by 26.8 percent while Democrats want a 39 percent hike.
   Bush puts the argument in terms of jobs, saying 650,000 people
would be thrown out of work if the minimum is raised to $4.65. Mrs.
Dole said the raise to $4.25 would cost 450,000 jobs, but other
provisions would make up part of that loss.
   However, Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Education and Labor Committee, noted that since it was established
in 1938, ``each time the minimum wage increased, employment also
increased, with the two recession years the sole exception.''
   Frustrated by watching social programs suffer during Reagan's
administration, Democrats are keying their minimum wage plans to the
hope that Bush won't use his veto power.
   ``I take it seriously, but not very,'' Sen. Howard Metzenbaum,
D-Ohio, a member of the labor committee, said of the threat. ``I've
been around long enough to know that when a president threatens a
veto, sometimes it means he will veto and sometimes it means the
beginning of the negotiating process.''

   Four Roman Catholic parishes may start a
pilot project to encourage ``sacrificial giving,'' similar to the
practice of tithing, because parishioners aren't giving enough to
allow church employees to get raises, a church official said.
   Bishop Louis E. Gelineau and the diocese's council of priests are
considering a proposal to encourage a ``sacrificial giving'' program
in four parishes that would be modeled on the tithing practice, said
the Rev. William J. McCaffrey, vicar for planning and finance of the
Diocese of Providence.
   The average parishioner puts roughly 1.1 percent of his or her
take-home pay in the collection plate, McCaffrey said Saturday at a
day-long conference for religious education teachers.
   As a result, the diocese has been unable to raise salaries for
parochial school teachers and other workers to keep up with public
school salaries in the past three years, he said.
   Some Protestant denominations practice tithing, which requires
congregants to give up to 10 percent of their incomes to the church.

   All the budget talk now going on won't shrink
the deficit much unless White House and congressional leaders
conquer a pervasive feeling that it's politically best to let the
problem slide until next year.
   ``The smarter strategy would be to take the strong steps now,''
said Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee. ``But I'm not kidding myself. Right now the votes are not
there ... for that kind of package.''
   Fiscal policy experts agree it's better to reduce the deficit
while the economy is strong. Government statistics last week showed
unemployment at a 15-year low, and other signs are positive.
   A new round of negotiations on the fiscal 1990 budget, with White
House budget director Richard Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and senior members of the House and Senate budget committees,
began Thursday and will resume Tuesday.
   ``There is still a great deal of hope and we're working
together,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, senior
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
   But the politicians have proven themselves unable to act without
some kind of calamity that creates public pressure, such as the 1987
stock market crash that forced a modest, two-year budget agreement
between President Reagan and Congress.
   No such crisis now exists.
   People ``don't see the greater evil lying out there from
inaction,'' said Robert Reischauer, director of the non-partisan
Congressional Budget Office. The budget negotiators ``don't have any
outside pressure either from the American people or the economy to
bolster up their backbone.''
   Reischauer, who became CBO director two weeks ago, agrees with
the many economists who believe the deficit probably won't cause an
immediately perceptible crisis as it gradually gnaws away at
America's economic strength.
   ``In an abstract sense, the vast majority of the American people
think something should be done,'' he said. But unless there's a
crisis such as a Wall Street crash or runaway inflation, ``they are
not willing to admit that they or their programs should be a part of
the solution.''
   ``There's a key element missing from the budget debate. And
that's a reason to act,'' said Stan Collender, a former staffer on
the House and Senate budget committees who now monitors federal
economic policy for the firm of Price Waterhouse.
   The Gramm-Rudman law was designed to create artificial crisis and
force action, using the threat of across-the-board spending cuts if
Congress and the president failed to meet pre-set deficit limits.
   But those ceilings depend on White House forecasts for the
economy and government spending. And, critics say, President Bush's
fiscal 1990 budget falls back on President Reagan's habit of
manipulating those forecasts to minimize tough budget choices.
   For example, Bush's plan to bail out the savings and loan
industry was created to be ``off-budget.'' Tens of billions of
dollars of costs thus do not show up on the balance sheets, and the
administration can claim it is meeting the Gramm-Rudman goal of a
deficit no larger than $100 billion in the new fiscal year.
   ``Spending saves money. Up is down. Black is white ... This is an
all-time low water mark in terms of kidding ourselves,'' said Carol
Cox, head of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, who
also cited the Bush budget reliance on projections of sharply lower
interest rates _ at the same time rates are going up.
   With Bush unwilling to confront the deficit head-on, ``all of the
incentives are for Congress to buy additional smoke and mirrors'' to
avoid unpopular spending cuts or challenging Bush to a tax increase,
she said.
   ``I fearlessly predict the deficit next year won't be much lower
(than this year),'' she said.
   The deficit has actually gone up in the last two years despite
much-ballyhooed plans that were supposed to reduce it. The
government now expects red ink to exceed $170 billion this fiscal
year, although Gramm-Rudman called for $136 billion.
   Further hindering bold moves this year, especially from the
Democratic-controlled Congress, is political distrust.
   Darman told reporters last week he has assured Democrats the
White House would step forward and share blame for unpopular parts
in a budget package. But there is widespread doubt among the
opposition party that Bush would control such partisans as
Republican National Committee Chairman Lee Atwater and Ed Rollins,
who heads the House Republican campaign office.
   And Republicans in the Senate remember taking a gutsy stand to
reduce the deficit in 1985 with a plan that included cutting back
Social Security cost-of-living adjustments. Democrats hammered them
with that vote, and wrested away control of the Senate.
   ``I think after five years of almost continuous budget warfare
that has torn apart the Congress... this has become awfully
fruitless ground to plow,'' said Steve Bell, staff chief of the
Senate Budget Committee when the Republicans were in control.
   By relying on the rosy assumptions, Congress and the president
need to restrain spending growth or raise revenues by only about $13
billion out of a $1.16 trillion spending plan in order to avoid the
Gramm-Rudman automatic cuts.
   Bell, now with Salomon Brothers, predicts: ``A slide-through,
glide through budget resolution.''
   The participants in the talks won't say that themselves, but Sen.
Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said
last week that Darman and the White House were privately seeking ``a
minimalist approach.'' Sasser also said that Darman said privately
that he might look at a tax increase next year.
   Darman denied it, but many on Capitol Hill say Bush's budget,
which carefully avoided spelling out billions of dollars in spending
cuts, made clear that the White House was no more willing to tackle
the deficit than Congress.
   ``We ought to get rid of this budget year as quickly as we can
because then, maybe next year, we can really get serious,'' said
Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., a member of the House Appropriations
Committee.

   An Iranian newspaper Sunday blamed the FBI
for the bombing of a U.S. Navy captain's van and said Washington
tried to implicate Iran in the attack to justify deportation of
Iranian students.
   The English-language newspaper Kayhan International linked the
alleged U.S. plot to Western anger at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
order that novelist Salman Rushdie be killed for his new novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   U.S. officials said Saturday the bombing of the van, driven by
the wife of the Navy man who mistakenly ordered the destruction of
an Iranian passenger jet, was being investigated as a possible
terrorist attack.
   The bombing ``will not be the last attempt to implicate Iran''
over the Rushdie controversy, Kayhan International said in an
editorial summarized by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The newspaper noted that one day before Friday's bombing in San
Diego, a U.S. Senate hearing was held at which an FBI official said
thousands of ``zealous'' Iranian students in the United States pose
a great threat to Americans.
   Therefore, the editorial said, Iran was not surprised when ``the
Federal Bureau of Investigation said that it was investigating
possible Iranian involvement'' in the bombing.
   In Washington, FBI spokeswoman Kathy Kennedy denied the
allegation and added, ``we have never made any linkage to Iran since
this incident happened.''
   ``We haven't gotten to the point (in the investigation) where we
could make such a linkage,'' she said.
   IRNA quoted the newspaper as saying the explosion was designed
``to create the necessary climate in the United States that would
justify the expulsion of Iranians.''
   No one was injured in the blast that destroyed a van driven by
Sharon Rogers, the wife of Navy Capt. Will Rogers III. Mrs. Rogers
got out of the van when she heard a noise witnesses described as
``two loud pops.'' The van exploded and burned moments later.
   As commander of the guided-missile cruiser USS Vincennes, Rogers
ordered the destruction of what he thought was an Iranian F-14 jet
fighter July 3 after the craft failed to respond to warnings in the
Persian Gulf.
   The aircraft was actually an Iranian civilian jet, and all 290
people aboard were killed.
   Rogers later said he acted to protect his ship and crew. He was
backed by the Reagan administration, which also decided to
compensate the victims' families.
   Iran's Parliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, has alleged that
Western governments may carry out terrorist attacks and link them to
Iran in retaliation for Khomeini's death order against Rushdie,
which was issued Feb. 14.
   Many Moslems believe ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam, and
Iranian clerymen have put a $5.2 million bounty on Rushdie's head.
The author, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family, has
been in hiding since Feb. 14.
   At Thursday's hearing in Washington, an FBI official said about
15,000 ``zealous'' Iranian students are in the United States and
might try to seek revenge against Rushdie supporters.
   Oliver ``Buck'' Revell told a Senate subcommittee looking into
the impact of Khomeini's death order that the students are
particularly dangerous because they cannot be monitored and because
the State Department's standards for issuing visas are lax.
   
   The controversy over the death sentence led Iran to break
diplomatic ties with Britain on Tuesday. Britain in turn announced
it was expelling up to 30 Iranians.
   IRNA quoted Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashami as also
calling for an economic embargo of British goods.
   ``If we boycott Britain economically, we will strike the heaviest
blow on this old colonialist country and supporter of infidelity,''
he said Sunday.

<HEAD>Rory Zuckerman Playing To Growing Audiences Of Youngsters, Parents</HEAD>

   She once sang of broken hearts and lonely
nights to boozy lounge lizards, but Rory Zuckerman's singing career
really took off when she switched to children and the joys of eating
broccoli or splashing in a bubble bath.
   Known simply as Rory _ ``Zuckerman is too much of a mouthful for
kids,'' she says _ the 33-year-old mother from suburban Bethesda,
Md., is playing to growing audiences of youngsters and their parents
with her toe-tapping, finger-snapping tunes and gentle ballads, many
inspired by her sons Daniel, 5, and Max, 16 months.
   She and guitarist-arranger Tom Guernsey have produced their first
album, ``I'm Just a Kid!,'' containing 10 songs that blend jazz,
blues, Broadway show tunes, Motown, pop and 50s doo-wop in a musical
style that Rory calls ``kidrock.''
   Sales figures since the album was released last August on her
Roar Music label suggest that it's a big hit among kids caught in
the musical no man's land between cutesy nursery rhymes and MTV's
teen-oriented heavy metal. Their baby-boomer parents seem to like
it, too.
   Her national distributor, Alcazar Productions of Waterbury, Vt.,
says more than 3,000 albums were sold in the first three months,
already the fastest-selling debut by a children's singer. Sales,
mostly in book and toy stores, could top 200,000 in the first year.
   Rory's concert dates have taken her from Vermont to Little Rock,
Ark., and they're accelerating. She expects eventually to perform 50
to 75 out-of-town engagements annually.
   She and Guernsey just completed their second children's album and
will start work soon on a third. They're making plans to produce a
full-length music video. Rory has appeared on NBC-TV's ``Today'' and
several other network shows, and is a regular guest on radio talk
shows.
   It's all a far cry from the seven years when Rory sang Top 40
hits at nightclubs, shopping malls, high school proms and and motel
lounges, and recorded radio jingles for fast-food restaurants and
local auto dealerships.
   She played in some real dives, she recalls. Like bowling banquets
in American Legion halls and ``joints where bouncers had to take
customers outside,'' she said. Once, she dutifully sang requests all
evening for a drunk who threw up on her before he passed out.
   Worse, her career was going nowhere fast.
   After her marriage to Washington builder Shelton Zuckerman in
1981 and the birth of Daniel, Rory listened to children's music for
hours.
   ``I heard a lot of nice sounds, a lot of folk and nursery rhymes,
but nothing that was terribly creative,'' she said in an interview
between studio recording sessions.
   ``A lot of people assume that kids' music should be very quiet
and very sweet and dull,'' she said. But she learned from Daniel
that ``kids are much more sophisticated that we give them credit
for. And they can pick up the lyrics and rhythm of a song much
faster than adults do.''
   Rory and Guernsey, who has teen-age children and also was reared
on the 60s sounds of the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Doobie
Brothers, started composing their own stuff about two years ago to
try to fill the gap.
   The infectious rub-a-dub rhythm of ``Bubble Bath'' is a favorite
of her toddler Max. The Incredible Piglets, stage puppets created by
a Jim Hensen designer, echo Motown's Supremes as they extoll the
delights of broccoli, squash and even rutabaga. ``Eating veggies is
our thing,'' they squeal.
   From a clash between Rory and Daniel, stuck at home and bored on
a rainy afternoon, came the lyrics to another song (``You, you're
drivin' me crazy, even though I'm crazy for you'') that examines
family frictions through the eyes of both parent and child.
   She and Guernsey aren't preachy moralists, Rory said, but if they
have a message it's to urge parents to ``lighten up and not take
everything so seriously.''
   ``Quit putting flash cards in the crib, quit pushing your kids to
be rocket scientists at age 3,'' she said. ``Let them have fun and
be innocent as long as they can, and don't forget to be a kid when
you're an adult.''

   Barry Levinson passed along praise
to ``Rain Man'' stars Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise after being
named best director of a feature film for 1988 by the Directors
Guild of America.
   ``Unless you can get the performances on the screen, all else
will ultimately fail,'' Levinson said in accepting the award
Saturday night at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
   Levinson noted that he had originally been brought in just to
advise on the film's script, and then, ``I end up with a movie in my
lap.''
   ``Rain Man,'' the story of a scheming car salesman learning to
love his autistic savant older brother, has received eight Academy
Award nominations, including best picture and best director.
   The winner of the guild trophy almost always repeats as best
director in the Academy Awards. And because the Academy's
best-directed film often receives the best picture Oscar, the DGA
awards hold a special significance for the film community.
   Bernardo Bertolucci won both the DGA award and the Oscar in 1988
for ``The Last Emperor'' and Oliver Stone doubled in 1987 for
``Platoon.'' Both those films also won the best picture Oscar.
   In the DGA television competition, those honored included
directors of episodes of the ABC series ``The Wonder Years'' and
``thirtysomething''; and directors of three specials: ``Lincoln,'' a
drama on NBC, ``Gangs,'' a CBS daytime special, and ``100th Birthday
Celebration (Irving Berlin),'' a CBS special in the musical-variety
category.

   Carroll O'Connor, star of television's ``All in
the Family'' and ``In the Heat of the Night,'' was reported in
``very good'' shape Sunday, a day after heart surgery.
   O'Connor is expected to remain in Emory University Hospital's
cardiovascular intensive care unit for another day or two, then move
to a standard hospital room for another week of recovery, according
to hospital spokeswoman Judy Smith.
   His wife, Nancy O'Connor, said Saturday evening that the actor
was ``responding in character, with strength and wit.''
   On Saturday, doctors performed six grafts to repair damage around
his heart.
   O'Connor, best known as the irascible Archie Bunker in the 1970s
hit ``All in the Family,'' currently is starring as Police Chief
Bill Gillespie on NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night.''
   David Gerber, chairman of MGM-UA Television, the show's
producers, said production on the show is continuing, and 18 of this
year's planned 22 episodes were already complete before O'Connor's
hospitalization.

   Utah Sen. Jake Garn says he had to fight
hard to guard his dream, writing a novel expressing the joy and
beauty of space travel, from being tainted by steamy sex scenes.
   Garn said when he saw a draft of his book, which he co-wrote with
Stephen Paul Cohen, he was alarmed.
   ``I told them that if that's the way the book will be, then the
project ends right now. I told them all that had to come out,'' Garn
said in an interview published Saturday in the Deseret News.
   ``It wasn't just that I am a Mormon senator from Utah and may be
prudish. It just was not accurate. Astronauts ... are good people
and professionals, not guttersnipes,'' the conservative Republican
senator added.
   But Garn, who rode on an April 1985 Discovery space shuttle
mission as a congressional observer, said he is happy with the final
version of ``Night Launch,'' which will be released April 28.
   ``It still has one affair in it, but nothing explicit. The most
explicit thing is two French kisses, but that's nothing compared to
what's on soap operas every day,'' Garn said.

   A nine-member congressional commission recently
recommended a 50 percent pay raises for judges, government officials
and lawmakers. Nobody got a penny of it.
   A 14-member commission created by Congress labored for a year on
ways to reduce the federal deficit. It ended hopelessly deadlocked.
   Now an eight-member commission appointed by President Bush to
come up with ethical standards applying equally to all three
branches of government has reported that it can't be done.
   The ethics panel report released Friday is one more bit of
evidence that sometimes the commissions government creates to help
with its problems produce more rhetoric than results.
   ``As a mayor or a governor or a president or a legislative body
that is being criticized for something looks for something to do,
one of the easiest things to do is to study the matter, to create a
commission,'' said Donald Rumsfeld, a former secretary of defense
and a member of the deficit reduction panel.
   ``Some serve a useful purpose, some don't,'' he added.
   As Rumsfeld noted, Washington has no monopoly on the idea of a
study panel.
   Joe Pisciotte, a professor of government at Wichita State
University in Kansas, studied commissions created by the city of
Wichita.
   ``The term I would use for some of them is the politics of
avoidance, that if the governing body doesn't want to deal with a
particularly sensitive problem itself, it will create a board or
commission or task force and pass the heat, so to speak,'' Pisciotte
said.
   Although Pisciotte studied the phenomenon in his own back yard,
he thinks his conclusions also would apply to many federal
commissions.
   ``I think the pay commission was a prime example that was too
politically sensitive, too politically difficult ... so the people
who were ultimately responsible for that passed the heat,'' he said.
   As to why some commissions produce more results than others,
experts say there is no single answer.
   One of the most successful commissions in recent years was the
15-member National Commission on Social Security Reform, created by
President Reagan in 1981, which prepared the blueprint for a Social
Security rescue bill that barreled through Congress in a matter of
weeks.
   Contrasting this with the National Economic Commission that made
the deficit study, Rumsfeld said: ``The difference was that the
environment for a compromise solution on Social Security was
hospitable. They really felt that they needed some mechanism to come
together with a compromise package.''
   The National Economic Commission, on the other hand, was created
by Congress in the wake of the October 1987 stock market crash amid
considerable speculation that it would recommend some kind of tax
increase. By the time it wound up its work, the market had rebounded
and George Bush, who had criticized the panel during the campaign
and vowed to continue Reagan's opposition to any tax hike, was
president.
   ``The only reason that thing was appointed was that you had
President Reagan, who talked a great game and did some wonderful
things for the country, but added a trillion dollars of debt because
he basically was a compromiser and he didn't want to use the veto,''
said one Republican who has served on a number of government
commissions. He spoke on the understanding his name not be used.
   Kenneth Janda, a professor of political science at Northwestern
University, said he believes a legal requirement that the
commission's meetings be public added to its difficulties.
   ``To the extent that partisanship is a major variable, I think
that open hearings become a real problem, because if you make any
kind of tactical concession it can be interpreted by your rivals
within the party as giving away something,'' Janda said.
   However, William Agee of Boise, Idaho, president of the giant
Morrison-Knudsen heavy construction firm, who served on the equally
politically charged and equally open pay commission, said, ``I
personally believe that open meetings are OK. I think they serve a
useful purpose.''
   The Commission on Executive, Legislative and Judicial Salaries,
which came up with the 50 percent pay hike that lawmakers turned
down in the face of a public uproar, was created by Congress in
1967. It is commonly called the quadrennial commission because it
makes its recommendations every four years.
   In 1981, the commission recommended a 22 percent pay hike and
outgoing President Carter approved it. Reagan had given his
unofficial approval before taking office, but later changed his mind
and withdrew his OK. In 1985, the commission's recommendations did
result in a raise, bringing congressional salaries to $75,100 a year.
   Members of the current commission still defend their
recommendations, although Preston R. Tisch, a former postmaster
general, conceded that ``maybe the 50 percent was a little high.''
   ``We thought the administration was going to massage it a little,
which they didn't,`` Tisch said. ``That was a calculation on our
part.''
   Under the law, the president can disapprove a recommended
increase or approve it either in whole or in part. Reagan, still in
office when the commission made its report, approved it in full.
   The ethics panel was launched by Bush in January with
instructions to come up with standards ``equitable across all three
branches of the federal government.''
   It decided, however, that the basic law that prevents executive
officials from taking government actions affecting their financial
interests could not be applied to members of Congress for
constitutional and other reasons.
   In addition, it was unable to decide what categories of work
should be exempt from limits on outside earnings. So the panel
recommended that such determinations be left up to the president.
Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chief architect of an ethics bill vetoed
by Reagan last year, denounced this as ``just a terrible idea.''
   R. James Woolsey, former counsel of the Senate Armed Services
Committee and a member of the ethics panel, said, ``The current
commission had to work very quickly because we were asked to get the
job done essentially in a month, and I think given that deadline,
did a rather strikingly complete job.''

<HEAD>GAO Study Finds Financial Management Reforms Inadequate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's implementation of financial
management reforms called for in a two-year law reorganizing the
Defense Department has been inadequate, according to a report
released Sunday.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found
that although the Army has consolidated its financial management
structure, the Navy has made few changes and the Air Force violated
the law.
   The Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of
1986 required that the military departments designate a single
office within their civilian secretariats to conduct financial
management, which includes budgeting, accounting, cash management,
financial reporting, internal control and review.
   ``Offices within the military department secretariats and
military headquarters that parallel or duplicate these functions are
to be merged into a solitary office located within the civilian
secretariat,'' said Rep. J. Larry Hopkins of Kentucky, ranking
Republican on the House Armed Services investigations subcommittee.
   The GAO study determined whether the departments' reorganizations
satisfied the law and what effects the streamlining had on civilian
control.
   ``Although the Army has met the law's requirements, questions
over Navy compliance remain, and the Air Force, though complying in
principle, violated the spirit of the law,'' said Rep. Nicholas
Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the House subcommittee.
   The Army, according to the report, merged the office of the
comptroller into the office of the assistant secretary for financial
management. The authority of the civilian assistant secretary was
enhanced and the staff increased from 29 to about 220.
   The GAO found significant reliance on ``dual-hatting'' in the
Navy and also discovered that the Marine Corps Fiscal Management
Division handled financial management. The division reports to the
commandant, thus violating the law's requirment that financial
management be handled by a civilian secretariat.
   At the Air Force, the responsibility of financial management was
consolidated within the secretariat but at the same time the
position of civilian assistant secretary was eliminated and the job
of military comptroller was established. The comptroller was then
transferred from the secretariat to the Air Staff.
   ``The Air Force turned the law on its head,'' Hopkins said.
``Instead of strengthening civilian control, it bent the law by
giving authority for financial management to a three-star general.''
   The Defense Department, in response to the report, noted that the
secretary of the Air Force has more direct control over financial
management than ever before.
   The reorganization act was named after its chief sponsors, former
Sen. Barry Goldwater, R-Ariz., and the late Rep. Bill Nichols, D-Ala.

<HEAD>Despite Cuomo's Stance, New York May Be On Verge Of A Death Penalty</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New York state introduced the electric chair
to the world in 1890 and may be on the verge of commemorating the
centennial by putting it back into use after more than 25 years
without legal executions.
   ``Even the White House is interested,'' said state Sen. Dale
Volker, an upstate Republican who is chief sponsor of New York's
death penalty legislation in the Senate.
   Last week, after more than five hours of emotional debate, the
Democrat-controlled Assembly approved a death penalty bill, 97-48.
Of the five legislators who did not vote, two have voted for the
death penalty in the past and the other three have voted against it.
   That means the 150-member Assembly is within one vote of being
able to override a certain veto by Gov. Mario Cuomo, which requires
a two-thirds vote in each house _ that is, 100 votes in the Assembly.
   ``I think one of them will blink,'' predicted Vincent Graber,
chief sponsor of the bill in the Assembly, of the 51 opponents.
   The Republican-controlled state Senate has voted to override
Cuomo's vetoes of the death penalty since 1985 and is expected to do
so again this year.
   Cuomo, whose vetoes have stood for each of the past six years,
has vowed to ``make my case over and over again'' against the death
penalty in the next few months. Before Cuomo, Democratic Gov. Hugh
Carey delivered six years of vetoes.
   But Cuomo acknowledged: ``it's a difficult message. People are
angry and disgusted.''
   The violence brought by New York City's crack epidemic has
greatly increased public outcry for a death penalty in the state,
the nation's largest without capital punishment on the books.
   There were 1,586 murders in the city last year through Oct. 31,
compared with 1,691 in all of 1987. Statewide, Graber said during
the Assembly debate, there were 2,225 murders last year, up more
than 10 percent from 1987.
   Two weeks ago, a federal drug agent was gunned down in New York
City.
   And three men are on trial for the murder last year of Police
Officer Edward Byrne, who was guarding the house of a witness in a
drug case. Prosecutors say the hit was ordered by a jailed drug
kingpin.
   During last year's presidential campaign, Byrne's father gave his
son's badge to pro-death penalty Republican George Bush.
   Such carnage, plus a poll showing 73 percent of his constituents
favored the death penalty, prompted one long-time Assembly opponent,
Edward Abramson, to switch his vote last week. His represents a
district in Queens, the New York City borough where Byrne was killed.
   New York is one of 13 states without an operative death penalty
statute. Of the 37 with death penalty laws, only 13 have held
executions since the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for them to
resume in 1976; most of the others may have death sentences pending
on appeal.
   The bill being considered in New York would allow the death
penalty to be used against several types of murderers, including
contract killers and those who murder a police officer.
   New York's electric chair was last used on Aug. 15, 1963, when
Eddie Lee Mays, convicted of a 1961 bar shooting, became the 695th
person to die in it.
   Volker said he's been getting calls from all over the nation
about the New York situation. He said the White House asked the
state Senate's Washington office for information about the Assembly
vote.
   Legislators say they can already feel pressure building.
   ``I've already gotten calls from two police officers and a
detective,'' Assemblyman Vito Lopez, a Brooklyn Democrat who opposes
the death penalty, said the day after last week's vote.
   ``The next few weeks will be very rough,'' said Lopez. ``People
have talked about this being the time to take a vacation or move
away.''
   Lopez said he expects to vote again against the death penalty,
but he doesn't flatly rule out a change of heart.
   ``If my district substantially lobbied me (in favor of the death
penalty bill), ... then I would have to look at it,'' he said.

   A new outbreak of meningitis has been
reported in northwestern Nigeria and has killed at least 90 people,
Radio Nigeria reported Sunday.
   The News Agency of Nigeria said an outbreak in late February
claimed 500 lives in eastern Anambra state, and epidemics in the
central states of Kwara and Niger resulted in a total of 143 deaths.
   The broadcast, monitored in Abidjan, said the latest outbreak was
centered in the Yauri district of Sokoto state and 400 people had
been hospitalized.
   The radio did not say when the latest outbreak began. They
identified the disease as cerebrospinal meningitis, and health
officials were quoted as saying a vaccination program was launched.
   Meningitis can be caused by bacterial or virus infection and
there are many strains.

<HEAD>High Mercury Levels In Glades Fish Alarm, Puzzle Experts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Everglades game fish are suddenly showing mercury
levels among the highest ever recorded in the United States,
alarming experts who are searching for a cause.
   Last week, Florida's department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services issued health warnings against eating largemouth bass and
warmouth caught in western parts of Palm Beach, Broward and Dade
counties.
   Fish samples contained up to 4.4 parts per million _ more than
four times the amount of methyl mercury that the federal government
considers safe.
   The Everglades mercury is attracting attention because the
precious environment there is already reeling.
   ``That's one of the highest concentrations ever recorded in the
country,'' said Frank D'Itri, a Michigan State University expert on
mercury. To find concentration up to 5 or 6 parts per million in
fish, he said, he had to go back to 1970, and that was in a lake
contaminated by hundreds of pounds of mercury from a factory.
   New tests have been ordered all over southeastern Florida in the
wake of the unexpected findings.
   Scientists are puzzled by the discovery of methyl mercury in the
Everglades. While the poisonous metal has been found frequently in
the heavily industrialized Northeast, it hasn't been found much in
Florida's rural swampland.
   Mercury, which is especially dangerous to an unborn fetus, can
cause central nervous system damage that leads to deafness,
numbness, reduced vision, loss of coordination and trembling. Eating
enough Everglades fish to cause such damage would take months, but
over a long enough time, poisoning would show its effects.
   There are many theories on how the metal entered the environment,
according to scientists.
   Winds from other regions could have blown mercury-laden factory
smoke from as far away as Mexico into southern Florida. Or midnight
dumpers could have thrown residue from some electronic manufacturer
secretly into the Everglades. Another theory holds that fire,
drought and rain could combine to leech the heavy metal from
naturally occurring deposits in the soil.
   Some scientists lean toward a theory that the contaminant has
lain in the muck at the bottom of the Everglades since before
mercury was banned from pesticides two decades ago.
   ``This may have been something that has been down here for 20
years or so,'' said University of Miami epidemiologist Dr. Thomas
Briggle. ``It has been that long since there was a legal fungicide
using mercury.''
   The likely sources would have been the sugar-cane fields that dot
the area.
   Briggle speculates that the recent drought and water shortages
have forced the water district to move water around inside the
Everglades, disturbing the mercury-laden muck at the bottom of
canals.
   Once the mercury was back in the water, it entered the food chain
and was concentrated in the bass and warmouth predators at the top.
   Burkett Neely, director of the Loxahatchee National Wildlife
Refuge, has doubts about the old fungicide theory, however. He notes
the pattern of the findings _ none have been found north of the
agricultural areas in Lake Okeechobee _ suggest the contamination
began more recently at a specific point or points.
   In addition, while the drought is serious, other years have been
as bad. Yet as recently as three years ago, fish samples showed far
lower mercury levels.
   ``We had some kind of event in the last three years that has put
a lot of mercury into the system,'' Neely said. ``Something happened
at the north end of the Everglades and traveled south.''
   Contamination from agriculture is one possibility. Another, he
said, is the illegal dumping by someone using nearby U.S. Highway
27. ``There's no telling what's in those canals,'' Neely said.
   Although the fish show no ill effects, and people have now been
warned against eating them, there still may be victims, said Dan
Dunford, director of the Everglades office of the Florida Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission.
   Several animals, including otters, raccoons and such endangered
species as Everglades mink, wood storks and snail kites, could be at
risk from mercury in the fish they eat or in other prey.

<HEAD>Radio Kabul Says 3,000 Rockets Rain Down On Jalalabad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan guerrillas fired 3,000 rockets
Sunday on the city of Jalalabad, but government troops repelled the
onslaught and killed at least 380 attackers, according to Afghan and
Soviet news reports.
   Guerrilla reports said 45 to 90 insurgents died in the battle for
the city, the target of some of the heaviest fighting in the
decade-long Afghan civil war.
   Soviet television reported that the Afghan army claimed 14,000
guerrillas backed by 3,000 Pakistani advisers took part in the
attack.
   Afghanistan's Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said 386
guerrillas and 36 ``foreign advisers'' were killed. The official
Soviet news agency Tass said 380 guerrillas and 11 Afghan soldiers
were killed.
   Radio Kabul said civilian and government casualties from the
rocketing were slight. It gave no total count.
   The broadcast said two Pakistani helicopters landed outside
Jalalabad on Saturday and unloaded weapons and ``foreign advisers''
before heading back home.
   Official spokesmen in the United States and Pakistan have denied
sending their nationals to the country, where U.S.- and
Pakistani-backed Moslem guerrillas are battling a communist
government.
   The Soviet television report, based on an Afghan army news
conference, said Jalalabad was not out of danger even though the
attack had been turned back. ``Judging by everything, the Pakistani
military circles, which sent more than 3,000 of their advisers here,
will try to do everything in their power to capture Jalalabad,'' it
said.
   Also Sunday, the Communist Party daily Pravda reported that
Afghan guerrillas fired on Soviet border guards in the Soviet
republic of Tadzhikistan.
   The newspaper claimed the culprits were connected with Pakistan,
but it did not say when the incident occurred or if anyone was
injured.
   The Soviet Union ended nine years of military intervention in
Afghanistan on Feb. 15, when the last of its 115,000 soldiers who
had been sent into the country left.
   That left the Afghan government alone to fight the guerrillas,
who have vowed to take power.
   Jalalabad is Afghanistan's fifth-largest city and is 40 miles
west of the Pakistan border, on the main highway between Pakistan
and the Afghan capital, Kabul.
   Guerrillas say the city's fall will signal the early demise of
the ruling communists.
   Thousands of the guerrillas have been moving toward Jalalabad
from Pakistan to join the offensive. The Afghan government says
3,100 guerrillas have died in fighting around Jalalabad, according
to Radio Kabul.
   Much of the fighting has been concentrated around Jalalabad's
airport, which guerrilla sources say remains in government hands.
   Before fighting began, guerrillas warned civilians and government
militia troops living in Jalalabad of the offensive and urged them
to evacuate, said Mohammad Shoaib, a spokesman for the
Jamiat-i-Islami rebel group.
   Western journalists returning to Pakistan from near Jalalabad
said residents have started to evacuate the city.
   Reports from Peshawar quoted one aid worker as saying as many as
15,000 Afghans were on the move, most of them on foot and taking
their livestock with them, the British Broadcasting Corp. said.
   A moderate rebel group called the National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan said it captured 500 Afghan soldiers and officers from
the key garrison of Samarkhiel on the outskirts of Jalalabad. Some
were paraded before journalists Sunday at a rebel camp outside
Peshawar.
   In London, the BBC reported Sunday that the Soviet Union has
carried out its first airlift of food to Kabul since the withdrawal
of Soviet troops.
   The BBC quoted an unidentified Afghan spokesman as saying two
Soviet transport planes took in 10 tons of flour each.
   Also Sunday, the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency said guerrillas
shot down a government fighter jet, killing everyone aboard. It gave
no further details and there was no way to independently confirm the
report.

<HEAD>Christians and Druse Battle; Beirut Airport Shut Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA ABU-NASR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian army troops and Syrian-backed
Druse militiamen battled fiercely Sunday in hills above Beirut, a
day after authorities shut down Lebanon's only international airport.
   A police spokesman said the clashes erupted in the evening in and
around the strategic hilltop town of Souk El-Gharb. The violence
broke a cease-fire called at midnight Saturday to halt the worst
fighting around the capital in two years.
   There was no immediate word on casualties from Sunday's artillery
and rocket duels between Christian units and militiamen of Druse
warlord Walid Jumblatt.
   Six people have been killed and 32 wounded since clashes broke
out Wednesday.
   On Saturday, after Druse militiamen shelled the city's port and
the Defense Ministry compound, the Christian Cabinet ordered
Beirut's airport closed, saying it was unsafe.
   The order came as a rebuff to Jumblatt, the public works and
tourism minister in the rival Moslem Cabinet. He had vowed to keep
the airport operating.
   In retaliation, the Moslem Cabinet moved Sunday to block sea
traffic to Christian-controlled harbors.
   ``Because of escalating hostilities, maritime traffic to the
Beirut port and the port of Jounieh is henceforth declared unsafe,''
said a statement issued by the Moslem administration.
   There was no immediate indication of what measures were planned
to blockade the ports. The Moslems have no naval force but could
launch long-range artillery attacks on Jounieh, which is 12 miles
north of Beirut and the main port in the Christian heartland.
   Directors of Middle East Airlines, the state carrier, suspended
flights indefinitely after a five-hour meeting Sunday at the Beirut
airport.
   Hundreds of mostly Lebanese passengers crowded the airport
departure lounge, then returned to the city when the suspension was
announced.
   An airport official who requested anonymity said staff were still
reporting for duty because they did not know how long the airport
would be closed. ``It's a day-by-day affair,'' he said.
   Bulgaria's Balkan Airlines canceled its scheduled flight to
Beirut, the only regular Sunday international flight to the city,
the official said.
   Syrian, Soviet and Czechoslovakian carriers are the only other
foreign airlines that regularly use the airport.
   Most of Sunday's fighting focused on Souk El-Gharb, a mountain
peak 15 miles southeast of Beirut that commands a network of roads
leading from Druse-held territory to Lebanon's Christian section.
   Police said thousands of people huddled in basements and bomb
shelters all Saturday night as the battling troops shelled Beirut
suburbs and 21 residential districts on both sides of the front
lines in Lebanon's central mountain range. The fighting has
imperiled efforts by an Arab League foreign ministers' committee to
resolve a crisis that threatens the country with permanent partition
into sectarian cantons.
   The crisis erupted when President Amin Gemayel's six-year term
expired Sept. 22 and Parliament was unable to elect a successor.
   Gemayel named the army chief, Gen. Michel Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic, to lead an interim military Cabinet. Moslems and leftists
rejected the appointment and pledged allegiance to Salim Hoss, a
Sunni Moslem who governed under Gemayel.

<HEAD>Palestinian Leaders Denounce Reports Of Bush Mideast Proposals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER C. PUTNAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Palestinian leaders denounced on Sunday new
proposals reportedly planned by the Bush administration for easing
tension in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The Palestinians, attending a Mideast peace symposium in New
York, called on the administration to push instead for a permanent
solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, including creation of an
independent Palestinian state.
   Several left-wing Israeli legislators attending the three-day
symposium, which began Saturday, also predicted that the U.S.
initiatives described in a published report Sunday would fail if
they included only interim measures for quelling the Palestinian
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The New York Times reported in its Sunday editions that the Bush
administration plans to propose that both Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization take steps to ease tension in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   U.S. officials plan to ask Israel to release some of the
Palestinians arrested during the 15-month uprising, end or limit
detentions and reopen schools in the territories, the newspaper
said, quoting an unidentified senior administration official.
   The U.S. initiatives also would call on the PLO to halt violent
demonstrations in the Israeli-occupied territories, block
anti-Israeli raids from southern Lebanon and stop distribution of
inflammatory leaflets, the newspaper said.
   ``These demands are unbalanced, unfair,'' said Faisal Husseini,
director of the Arab Studies Center in East Jerusalem and a top
Palestinian leader in the occupied territories.
   He said the new U.S. proposals were flawed because ``they are
asking us to stop the demonstrations,'' while Israel was being asked
``the minimum.''
   Husseini and PLO officials at the symposium said the real issue
is ending Israel's occupation of the territories, captured from
Jordan and Egypt during the 1967 Middle East war, and creating a
Palestinian state.
   ``The intefadeh (the Arabic name for the uprising) is our only
weapon for continuing the peace plan,'' said Nabil Shaath, chairman
of the Political Committee of the Palestine National Council, the
PLO's legislative arm. ``What is not negotiable is the final result:
an independent Palestinian state side-by-side with the state of
Israel.''
   Afif Safieh, the PLO representative in the Netherlands, said the
reported new U.S. proposals were aimed at the wrong target.
   ``The target should not be how to decrease the level of tensions,
but how to practice, manage and plan the solution to the conflict,''
he said.
   Yossi Sarid, a member of the left-wing Citizens Rights Movement
in Israel's Knesset, or parliament, said the Bush proposals ``show
at least that the new administration has a sense of urgency'' about
restarting the Mideast peace process.
   But he said if the administration plans only ``an interim
agreement,'' without addressing the final status between Israel and
the PLO, the proposals will fail.
   Yair Tzaban, a Knesset member from the Socialist Mapam party,
said the proposals were incomplete.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ``is like the man riding a bicycle,''
he said. ``He can go either forward or backward, but he cannot stand
still because he will fall down. So we must push the peace process
forward.''
   The new Bush proposals will be presented Monday when Israeli
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens meets with the president, the Times
reported, while the suggestions for the PLO will be presented
through the American ambassador in Tunis, Robert Pelletreau Jr.
   The three-day symposium at Columbia University is the first to be
sponsored by Israelis and Palestinians in cooperation with U.S. Jews
and Arabs.

<HEAD>Adjustment Will Be Worse For Non-Union Eastern Workers _ Psychologists</HEAD>

   Striking Eastern Airlines employees have the
psychological benefit of venting their feeling while picketing, but
non-union workers who found themselves out of work overnight will
have a tougher time adjusting, psychologists say.
   Mitchell Lee Marks, an organizational psychologist who helps
major companies through mergers and cutbacks, said he has been
impressed by the commitment of Eastern's unions to the 60-year-old
carrier.
   ``Eastern means something to them,'' said Marks, a consultant in
the Los Angeles office of Mercer Meidinger Hansen. ``I am impressed
by the extent in which people want to buy into their company
psychologically.''
   The union's tactic of focusing attention on Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., as the bad guy in the
strike that virtually grounded the Miami-based airline is beneficial
for the employees, he said.
   ``What's fascinating about this case is it really comes down (to)
a personality battle. You don't hear people talking about the
economics of the situation,'' he said. ``That's part of the reason
they're rebelling against Lorenzo and not Eastern. It's this raider
Lorenzo who would come in and try to break them.''
   But all Eastern employees must face the changes that in less than
a week landed the nation's seventh-largest airline in bankruptcy
court.
   ``You lose all sense of control,'' said Robert Ziller, a
University of Florida psychology professor. ``But in a way they're
sustained by the fact they have a common opponent (Lorenzo). People
have been known to endure five years of bombing under those
circumstances.''
   Since many Eastern employees have long service with the carrier,
``they have to make almost a midlife, midcareer transition, which is
very, very difficult,'' said Douglas M. McCabe, an associate
professor of labor relations at the Georgetown University school of
business.
   An employee's standard of living ``gets cut drastically and
they're eating hot dogs. ... You're going from a very high standard
of living to one that's very low,'' he said.
   About 9,500 of the company's non-union workers ended up in the
worst psychological position of all when they were laid off without
notice last week, but some experts believe they will have an easier
time finding work because they have more flexible skills than the
pilots, machinists and flight attendants trained for a single job.
   Marks suggested group discussion sessions for non-union workers
to vent their feelings, an avenue union members have at the union
hall and on picket lines.
   Eastern workers will go through stages of denial, expecting the
strike to be over soon, to anger against Lorenzo and the strikers,
to planning strategy about staying with Eastern and job hunting, to
``acceptance, and you've got to go through those stages,'' Marks
said.
   McCabe expects a transition time of six months to a year while
people find new jobs.
   He and Marks likened the strike to recent mergers and corporate
cutbacks because of the similar labor adjustments.
   ``If you have a massive downsizing, you're truly changing the
organization. It cannot not change,'' said Marks, who acted as a
consultant as Delta Air Lines absorbed Western Airlines in 1987 and
helped with the creation of the Unisys corporation.
   ``There's a myth that some managers hold (that) the people will
be grateful that they survived,'' he said. ``But that's the farthest
from the truth because ... they're waiting for the other shoe to
drop.''
   Marks believes corporations have responsibility to help their
employees to adjust and employees need to take greater control of
their lives.
   ``The lesson to be learned for all employees is you've got to be
more responsible, to be more alert to what changes will come down
the pike,'' he said. ``The lesson to be learned by employers is to
send a message that their people matter.''

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha denied
Sunday that he is involved in a power struggle with his heir
apparent, and he said he is ready to resume work following a stroke.
   In his first televised remarks since his Jan. 18 stroke, the
73-year-old Afrikaner said he has a constitutional duty to continue
in office.
   He made no reference to calls for him to step down when he spoke
in a 15-minute, prerecorded interview on state television network's
evening news show.
   Two weeks after his Jan. 18 stroke, Botha resigned as leader of
the National Party and was succeeded by Education Minister F.W. de
Klerk, 52.
   De Klerk and other senior Nationalist leaders met Botha last week
amid reports a solid majority of the party's parliamentary caucus
wants Botha to retire promptly or cede a significant share of power
to de Klerk. More talks are expected this week.
   Botha, who showed no signs of ill-health during the interview,
said de Klerk ``was being misused by some people,'' but insisted
there is no personal conflict.
   ``That would be a terrible charge against he and I,'' said Botha,
noting he appointed de Klerk to key parliamentary posts in past
years.
   ``Why? Because I have faith in him,'' Botha said.
   He indicated he was displeased with suggestions a de Klerk
presidency would herald a new era of political reform.
   ``I originated the concept of reform,'' Botha said.
   ``Mr. de Klerk has always shared these sentiments with me,'' he
added. ``There are forces in this country seeking to exploit an
unfortunate situation to sow political confusion.''
   Botha said even before his stroke, he advocated steps to lighten
the presidential workload. But he gave no hint when he might retire
from the post he has held since 1978. He said it was too early to
say when he might call a general election, which must be held within
12 months.
   ``I am healthy now,'' Botha said. ``I want to talk to fellow
Cabinet members. I want to talk to leaders of other population
groups on South Africa's future.''
   ``I'm not looking for power for the sake of power ... I'm open to
advice,'' he said.
   Near the end of his interview, he summed up his basic message:
``Stay calm _we're living in dangerous times, in difficult times.''
   The Botha-de Klerk confrontation was front-page news in all major
newspapers Sunday.
   ``Botha the Defiant,'' said a banner headline in the Sunday
Times, the country's largest-selling newspaper.
   ``P.W. Stands Alone,'' said the Sunday Star.
   ``Mr. Botha's attitude is quite irrational,'' said a Star
editorial. ``The real interests of this country ... are certainly
more crucial than the quirks of a fading strong man reluctant to let
go of power.''

   Cafeterias at the nation's second-largest
school district will stop serving apples to students this week in
response to a report finding a cancer risk to children from a
chemical residue on some fruit.
   The ban also includes any apple products, including juice, pies
and applesauce, said Los Angeles Unified School District officials.
   The district's 592,000 students have eaten more than 5 million
apples each year, second only to the New York City school system,
where students consumed 13 million apples. New York schools enacted
a similar ban last week.
   ``That's a lot of apples, so we decided to do it in order to
protect the health and safety of students,'' said Los Angeles
district spokeswoman Eva Hain.
   The bans in Los Angeles and New York followed a Feb. 28 report by
the Washington-based National Resources Defense Council, which said
the chemical daminozide could increase the incidence of cancer in
children.
   Daminozide, sold under the brand name Alar, is sprayed on apple
trees in the spring and acts to keep apples on the tree longer. That
makes harvesting easier, improves the apples' color and firmness,
and extends their shelf life.
   Alar permeates the fruit's skin and cannot be peeled off or
washed away.
   Apple growers have criticized the report, contending that only 4
percent of the apples sold in the United States show any traces of
Alar and that those traces fall well below federal Environmental
Protection Agency levels.
   ``It's very disturbing that Los Angeles would arbitrarily make a
decision to ban apples based on the results of one report in which
the facts are not right,'' said Derl I. Derr, president of the
Virginia-based International Apple Institute, a trade organization
for the $1.2 billion-a-year industry.
   ``An apple a day is still healthy advice,'' Derr said.
   The federal EPA has moved to ban Alar eventually, but has said it
disagrees with the environmental group's contention that the risk
from using it is so great that an immediate ban is needed.
   The California Department of Food and Agriculture also criticized
the group's study.
   The Los Angeles school district will not serve apples or apple
products until it conducts its own laboratory tests, said Randy
Altenberg, deputy director of food services for the district.
   ``We are taking a cautious approach to a problem that could
affect the health of our schoolchildren,'' he said.

   Unseasonably warm weather covered much of the central part of the
nation Sunday and highs reached record levels in some spots, but
snow was scattered in the Northeast and part of the northern Plains.
   The unexpected warmth extended over the lower Mississippi Valley
and the lower two-thirds of the Plains.
   Early record highs included 60 at Casper, Wyo.; 92 at Lubbock,
Texas; and 93 at Midland, Texas.
   Snow fell during the afternoon from southern Maine to northern
sections of Rhode Island and Connecticut, and from east-central
through northwestern New York state.
   Snow also fell from south-central Minnesota across east-central
North Dakota.

<HEAD>Poll: Koch Popularity Hits New Low, Giuliani in Lead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch, his popularity at a new
low, would lose at every level of a mayoral election, and former
U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani would win, according to a poll
released Sunday.
   Among Democrats, Manhattan Borough President David Dinkins would
beat Koch in a primary if it were being held now, according to the
poll. The primary is set for September and the general election for
November.
   The telephone poll, conducted March 3-7 by the Gallup
Organization for New York Newsday, surveyed 1,012 New Yorkers.
   Six months before the primary, 50 percent of those polled
disapproved of how the three-term mayor does his job, up five points
in three months. Thirty-one percent approved of the mayor's
performance, down from 37 percent in December.
   Sunday's poll showed Dinkins leading a four-way Democratic
primary against Koch, Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin and real estate
developer Richard Ravitch. In the runoff poll, Dinkins would beat
Koch, 58 percent to 32 percent; and Goldin, 54 percent to 26 percent.
   Asked how they would vote in the November general election,
respondents chose Republican Giuliani, the popular former prosecutor
who has not announced his candidacy but has indicated an interest in
running, over Koch or Dinkins.
   Giuliani beat either Koch or Dinkins one-on-one, and both in a
three-way general election. Voters preferred Giuliani to Koch, 58
percent to 31 percent, and to Dinkins, 48 percent to 41 percent.
   The only declared Republican candidate, Former Ambassador Ronald
Lauder, son of cosmetics tycoon Estee Lauder, was not included in
the poll.
   In every ethnic division except Hispanics, Koch met with more
disapproval than approval. Koch, asked to respond, said, ``there's
nothing surprising in the poll.''
   Giuliani saw the numbers as ``encouraging, and they're a
reflection of support I've been getting when I walk along the
streets.''
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 6 percent. No
Democrat candidate got the 40 percent needed to avert a runoff
between the top two candidates. Dinkins had 37 percent, Koch 28
percent, and Ravitch 4 percent.

<HEAD>A Revival of `Measure for Measure' Opens at Lincoln Center</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs planned.</HEAD>

   ``Measure for Measure,'' the darkest of
Shakespeare's comedies, deals with sexual hypocrisy, political
intrigue and urban lawlessness.
   In other words, a perfect play for our times, a fact reinforced
by the clear, concise, modern-dress production that opened last week
at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater in Lincoln Center.
   The director is Mark Lamos, artistic head of the Hartford Stage
Company. Lamos built his regional theater reputation in Connecticut
on a series of dazzling interpretations of Shakespeare including a
debonair, 1930-ish ``Twelfth Night,'' a surrealistic and
phantasmagorical ``Pericles'' and a lavish ``Hamlet,'' starring
Richard Thomas. The latter looked like a series of staged photo
opportunities for the evening news.
   His ``Measure for Measure'' is more austere, almost antiseptic in
design and execution. Designer John Conklin's minimalist environment
consists of a white, graffiti-covered wall, a naked light bulb
hanging over the stage and a few pieces of what looks like
secondhand office furniture.
   A sense of dislocation prevails. Although the setting is Vienna,
it could be anywhere. An actor reads a German-language newspaper,
but the graffiti on the wall is in English. The costumes, also by
Conklin, are a mixture of Madison Avenue conservative and Soho chic.
   For a comedy, ``Measure for Measure'' mostly stays somber until
the end of the evening. Until then, audiences have to deal with the
machinations of the Duke who leaves his kingdom in the hands of
Angelo, a self-righteous bureaucrat.
   When Angelo orders Claudio to be executed for his sexual
escapades, he doesn't realize he will fall in love with the
condemned man's sister Isabella. Angelo offers a reprieve in
exchange for sexual favors from the woman. It takes the Duke,
disguised as a friar, quite a while to straighten out the mess.
   Len Cariou's paternal portrayal of the Duke is fine, but his
speaking voice is odd, slow and measured as if he were reciting a
foreign language lesson. Campbell Scott, looking like a young, eager
Wall Street lawyer, projects the coldness of the ambitious Angelo as
well as his frantic desire when the man realizes that he wants
Isabella. Bradley Whitford projects the passion of a young man
afraid to die.
   A sweet-faced Kate Burton makes a forthright heroine,
particularly when she is standing up to Angelo's lechery. She's also
beguiling as she gradually realizes she is falling in love with the
Duke. Their embrace at the end of the play is a triumph of the
romantic spirit that, until then, has been overshadowed by lust.
   Lamos minimizes the comic characters here, but there are some
expert comic cameos by Lois Smith as a blowzy, aging prostitute and
Jack Weston as Pompey, that experienced bawd turned apprentice
executioner. Weston seems as comfortable and proficient with
Shakespeare as he does with television sitcom, a remarkable
accomplishment.
   Several of the minor characters are at odds with Lamos' unfussy
direction particularly Reggie Montgomery as an overly mannered pimp
and Thomas Ikeda as a grating, one-note policeman.
   ``Measure for Measure'' always has been called one of
Shakespeare's problem plays because of its juxiposition of comedy
and tragedy. Both are very near the surface of this dissection of
sexual and governmental power. It's to the credit of the director
and his fine cast that the right balance has been found between the
two.

   Devout Roman Catholics, inspired by the
visions of a pipefitter from suburban New Orleans, and the curious
gathered in a vegetable field near this tiny southeastern Louisiana
town Sunday, hoping to see the Virgin Mary.
   Some of the estimated 3,000 people present said they did indeed
see what they came to see.
   ``I believe that I saw her, Jesus, Joseph and the angels and the
saints,'' said Shelly Ann Theresa, 28, from the New Orleans suburb
of Covington. ``I'm kind of nervous and overwhelmed.''
   Some took pictures of the sun with instant cameras and pointed to
the splotchy, multicolored images as evidence that holy apparitions
had appeared.
   ``See, here's the Blessed Mother,'' said Diane Deroche of Luling
as she pointed to a photograph she had taken.
   Theresa Thibodeaux of Hammond also held photos, taken earlier in
the day, of what she said were the gates of heaven.
   ``I'm expecting a miracle. I'm blind in this eye and I have
glaucoma in the other. My nephew is crippled and my uncle has
cancer,'' she said, beginning to sob. ``It may not be for me, but I
believe in my heart. You have to believe for a miracle.''
   Alfredo Raimondo, 52, is the man whose tales of miraculous
visions sparked the huge turnout at Tickfaw. A few weeks ago, the
Tunisian native, now a pipefitter from Chalmette, said the Virgin
Mary had appeared to him recently and told him to go to Tickfaw to
honor St. Joseph.
   Raimondo stayed sequestered in a mobile home on the edge of the
vegetable field early Sunday, but later emerged and began wandering
among the faithful, many of whom reached out to touch him as he
ambled through the crowd.
   ``I'm very happy,'' he said ``We're letting Joseph show us the
way. There are a lot of people here.''
   Not everyone was sure a miracle would happen.
   ``We wanted to see what was going to happen. We're going to Mass
here and anything else is extra,'' said George Rand.
   Outside Raimondo's trailer, families with lawn chairs and coolers
ate picnic lunches in the 80 degree sunshine, while someone led Hail
Mary prayers over a loudspeaker.
   Women knelt in muddy ruts among the cabbages and onions saying
prayers. Some had floral crosses by their sides.
   Others knelt before a St. Joseph's altar heaped with food,
flowers and a picture of the Last Supper.
   A large wooden cross had been erected in the field by Raimondo.
   A spokesman for the Archdiocese of New Orleans did not
immediately return a telephone call Sunday seeking comment on the
vision reports.
   Last summer, about 12,000 people gathered for a Mass on the
grounds of a charismatic church in Lubbock, Texas, where three
parishioners claimed to receive messages from the Virgin Mary.
   The three parishioners said they began receiving messages from
the Virgin Mary arlier in the summer, shortly after they returned
from a pilgrimage to Medugorje, Yugoslavia, where six youths claim
they have seen apparitions of Mary since 1981.

   A police officer was shot to death
when he pulled over a man for speeding and then tried to arrest him
on an outstanding traffic ticket, authorities said.
   Patrolman Richard Scott Rogiers, 29, a six-year veteran of the
force in this San Antonio suburb, was shot in the back of the head
early Saturday. He died early Sunday at Medical Center Hospital in
San Antonio, said a hospital spokesman.
   Police said they arrested Robert Sanchez, 34, a San Antonio
insurance salesman, about 45 minutes after the shooting.
   Investigators said Rogiers had stopped the driver of a Mercury
for speeding and ran a routine warrant check on the man's driver's
license. After learning the driver had an outstanding San Antonio
traffic citation, Rogiers returned to the Mercury and tried to
arrest the driver. Police on duty during the weekend would not give
details on the citation.
   A scuffle ensued and Rogiers was shot in the back of the head
with a small-caliber weapon, officers said.
   ``He was one you don't expect something like this to happen
because he's cautious, he's good,'' said Balcones Heights emergency
dispatcher Ben Hoeffner.
   When officers discovered Rogiers, his service revolver was still
in his holster and the driver's license belonging to the motorist
was tucked into his gun belt, the Light reported.
   Officers later found Sanchez hiding in a wooded area near the
residence listed on the driver's license.
   Sanchez, who reportedly had no previous criminal record, was
being held on attempted capital murder charges in lieu of $1 million
bail. Officials said the charge would be upgraded to capital murder
because of the death of Rogiers, who had a 2-year-old son.

<HEAD>Far Right Party Gains Seats, Kohl's Party Loses Control in Frankfurt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NESHA STARCEVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An extreme rightist party won
seven City Council seats in municipal elections Sunday that dealt a
crushing defeat to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats.
   The extreme-right National Democratic Party took 6.6 percent of
the vote, according to preliminary results, winning representation
in city government for the first time since 1968.
   In January, another far-right party, the Republicans, won seats
in the West Berlin legislature.
   Both parties want to sharply reduce the number of foreigners in
West Germany, and their success marks a major shift to the right
among a growing number of voters.
   About two hours after the preliminary results of the vote became
known, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the city hall
against the National Democrats. Police reported no incidents.
   Kohl's conservatives suffered heavy losses in other
municipalities in Hesse state, but their worst rout came in
Frankfurt, where they had governed alone since 1977.
   Preliminary results from the official state voting office, based
on computer projections, gave the Christian Democrats 36.6 percent
of the Frankfurt vote. That dropped their representation in city
government from 48 to 36 seats.
   The leftist Social Democrats, the mainstream opposition party,
won 40.1 percent and 40 seats, up from 37 seats won after 1985
elections. The anti-NATO Greens won 10.1 percent and 10 seats, up
from eight previously.
   The National Democrats did not run in the 1985 elections.
   The outcome ousted Frankfurt's Christian Democratic Mayor Wolfram
Brueck, who will be replaced by Social Democrat Volker Hauff, a
48-year-old former federal transport minister.
   The leftist Greens also scored major gains in the rest of Hesse
state, where 4.1 million voters were eligible to vote. The Social
Democrats were projected to score moderate statewide gains.
   The National Democrats campaigned hard in Frankfurt against the
large number of foreigners in the city. With 148,000 foreigners _ 25
percent of its population _ Frankfurt has the largest proportion of
foreigners of West German cities.
   The issue was used by the Republicans in the West Berlin
elections on Jan. 29. The Republicans won 7.5 percent of the vote
and 11 seats in West Berlin's legislature.
   The rightists were projected to score minor gains outside
Frankfurt.
   Michael Friedmann, a Jewish community leader and a Christian
Democrat, said the National Democratic gains will have ``serious
consequences.''
   ``This is the worst result of the election,'' Friedmann told
Hesse state television. ``This will damage West Germany's reputation
abroad.''
   The outcome in Frankfurt appeared to pave the way for a leftist
coalition in Frankfurt between the Social Democrats and the Greens.
   A similar coalition is expected to start governing in West Berlin
next week after an agreement between the Social Democrats and the
Alternative List, a leftist party similar to the Greens.

   A skydiver who jumped out of an airplane
with three fellow parachutists fell to his death in an accident
being investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration, officials
said.
   The body of Robert Sweet, 43, of Salem, N.H., was found in woods
in this southwestern Maine town near the New Hampshire border a
couple of hours after Saturday's jump, said Warden Mark Warren of
the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife.
   ``As far as we can determine now, it appears as if the chute
didn't open properly,'' Warren said. FAA Regional Duty Officer
Claudio Gualco said Sunday from Burlington, Mass., that the cause
had not been determined.
   Sweet and three fellow members of the Lebanon Skydivers took off
from their private airstrip here around noon in a Cessna 182, Warren
said. The others landed safely.
   An eight-member search team from the York County Sheriff's
Department and 80 volunteers combed the woods for more than two
hours before finding the body at 3:45 p.m.
   FAA investigators planned to try to interview the other three
skydivers on Monday, Gualco said.

   Italy's leading anti-Mafia crusader wants authorities
to tighten up policy on granting hospital stays to jailed mob bosses
who have been hospitalized up to two years, news reports said Sunday.
   Domenico Sica, the high commissioner against organized crime,
sent a letter to Sicilian magistrates urging vigilance when
considering such requests from convicted Mafia members, state radio
and newspapers said.
   La Stampa newspaper reported at least 14 convicted members of the
Mafia, the Sicilian organized crime group, are hospitalized in
Palermo.
   La Repubblica newspaper reported Sica as writing that some Mafia
``heads of clans'' have been in the hospital for two years while the
average hospital stay for inmates is two weeks.
   ``We maintain that there is something wrong with the mechanism of
admissions and diagnosis and it should be remedied as quickly as
possible,'' he was quoted as saying. He said many of the medical
tests could be done in jail.
   In November, the head of Palermo's paramilitary police force
complained that too many of his officers were taken off other duties
to guard convicted hospital patients.
   Sica was quoted as saying at least 100 police officers are needed
to keep Mafia members apart from each other in the hospital and
prevent them from conducting business.

<TEXT>
   A lawyer has accused a district attorney
of making him a target of an undercover operation to coerce him into
working against his own clients, in a case his supporters say could
endanger attorney-client relations.
   Robin Auld, 43, who faces criminal charges in connection with the
case, has filed notice he plans to sue 6th Judicial District
Attorney Victor Reichman. Auld contends Reichman set up the
undercover operation with the intent of trapping Auld and forcing
him to betray his own clients.
   Auld's lawyer, Hal Haddon, says the case threatens the country's
adversarial system of justice ``because a defendant has to be able
to believe his own lawyer isn't working for the DA.''
   He was charged last month with theft by receiving and of
possession a dangerous weapon. He said it was because he had
rejected Reichman's threats. He faces trial May 22 in Durango and
could get up to eight years in prison and lose his law license if
convicted.
   Reichman has declined to comment on the case against Auld, which
he has turned over to a special prosecutor from another district,
Keith Cross of Glenwood Springs.
   According to Auld's complaint, local law enforcement officials
assigned a deputy sheriff, Brent Pace, to pose as a criminal
defendant named ``Colton Young'' and approach Auld for legal help. A
false charge and phony affidavit were filed in court to make it
appear that ``Young'' really was in legal trouble.
   The officials supplied Pace with $500 in public money to pay half
of Auld's fee, the complaint said. After Auld won dismissal of the
misdemeanor charges against Pace, Pace offered to pay the remaining
$500 in legal fees in drugs, and when Auld refused, Pace offered him
guns.
   Auld said he eventually agreed to keep an Uzi machine gun as
collateral on the balance Pace owed, and he was immediately
arrested. He contends Reichman and Police Sergeant John Ball offered
him a deal in which no charges would be filed if Auld agreed to
``set up'' three of his clients for Reichman. Auld refused and
Reichman filed the weapons charges, the complaint said.
   Cross, the special prosecutor, would not comment on the case. But
in a preliminary hearing, he said that Auld believed the gun Pace
had given him was stolen because that's what Pace had said. He also
said Auld knew the weapon had been altered to make it an illegal,
automatic weapon, which Auld disputes.
   Two lawyers were among 15 people, several of them locally
prominent, who signed a public letter questioning Reichman's
treatment of Auld. Attorney Sam Maynes, one of the signers, said the
case ``goes to the very basis of the attorney-client relationship.
It's just not right and that's why I signed the letter.''
   Auld's lawyer, Hal Haddon, made a similar point, saying: ``What
stinks to me is setting up the defense bar and turning them against
their own clients. It destroys people's faith. You'd wonder if your
lawyer is working for the police.''
   Auld's notice of intent to sue, filed Feb. 14, said he will seek
at least $1 million, plus punitive damages, for damage to his
reputation, cost of his defense and loss of earning capacity. Named
along with Reichman are the sheriff and police department in
Durango, the city council, county commission and the Colorado
Department of Public Safety.

   Israeli soldiers on Sunday killed two
Palestinian guerrillas who entered Israel's self-declared security
zone in south Lebanon on a mission to infiltrate the Jewish state.
   The incident was likely to increase Israeli demands that the
United States halt its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   In the occupied West Bank, a Palestinian stabbed an Israeli
soldier in Bethlehem, and soldiers broke up a funeral for a
17-year-old Palestinian who died Sunday of wounds suffered in a
clash the previous day.
   The soldier was reported in fair condition and Israel radio said
his attacker was captured after being shot three times with rubber
bullets.
   Radio reports said the soldier was stabbed with a kitchen knife
as troops ordered youths to erase anti-Israeli graffiti and take
down outlawed Palestinian flags.
   The West Bank man who died was identified as Mohammed Shrain of
the Aida refugee camp. Witnesses said soldiers blocked off the camp
and fired tear gas and rubber bullets to block his funeral. The army
confirmed the death and said it placed a curfew on the camp.
   At least 395 Palestinians and 17 Israelis been killed during the
15-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   In the occupied West Bank, the army sealed with concrete the home
of a Palestinian who stabbed an Israeli soldier Sunday in the
biblical city of Bethlehem, Arab and Israeli news reports said.
   An army spokesman said the alleged assailant was caught and
confessed to the stabbing. The sealing or demolition of homes is
routine punishment for suspects in such attacks. Israel views the
punishment as a deterrent to future perpetrators.
   At least 12 Palestinians were reported wounded Sunday in clashes
with soldiers throughout the occupied territories.
   The army confirmed eight of the injuries.
   The fighting in south Lebanon erupted when two armed guerrillas
were spotted on the edge of the Israeli security zone near Hasbaya,
about five miles north of Israel's border.
   No Israeli troops were injured, Israeli military officials said.
   The radical Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, in a statement issued at Rashaya, Lebanon, said the
guerrillas were among a group sent on a military operation into
Israel. The others escaped, said a group spokesman, who insisted on
anonymity.
   The confrontation was the third between PLO guerrillas and
Israeli soldiers in less than three weeks. Israel cited the two
earlier encounters in calling on the United States to call off its
dialogue with the PLO.
   Israel maintains the fighting in the security zone is evidence
that PLO chief Yasser Arafat is violating his pledge to give up
terrorism. Arafat's pledge was behind the U.S. agreement in December
to open a dialogue with the PLO.
   Israel established the six- by 10-mile wide zone in south Lebanon
to protect its northern border when it pulled most of its forces out
of the region in 1985, ending a three-year occupation.
   Arafat, meanwhile, was quoted Sunday as saying he is willing to
go to Jerusalem to convince Israel's leaders to agree to an
international conference on Middle East peace. But he said he would
only do so with the agreement of other Arab states.
   Arafat spoke in an interview with Italy's La Repubblica
newspaper. He has made similar statements in the past.
   Also Sunday, the army said a colonel had been suspended from his
post for allegedly stealing a wristwatch off the body of a dead
guerrilla.
   The colonel was identified only as ``Col. R.,'' and the spokesman
said he was an ``experienced and a veteran fighter.'' He was
suspended from his post pending clarification of the legal
ramifications of the incident, the spokesman said.

   Four Scottish constables arrived Sunday to calm
families who say they can't put to rest loved ones killed by a
terrorist bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 until the victims' personal
belongings are returned to them.
   The senior police officers wanted to ease the pain and confusion
felt by many families of the 259 victims whose possessions have been
withheld during the investigation of the Dec. 21 plane explosion
over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Assistant Chief Constable Paul Newell said he and his fellow
officers also wanted to quell rumors.
   ``We got the feeling there was a great deal of misinformation
about what we were doing with the personal items,'' Newell said.
``We came to tell the relatives the truth right from the horse's
mouth.''
   More than 100 people gathered in Boston to hear the constables'
reassurances that many of the victims' personal belongings would be
returned and to examine maps of the rugged terrain where the
victims' bodies were found.
   ``It's a very traumatic thing for us,'' said Joe Horgan of West
Point, Pa., whose brother-in-law was on Flight 103. ``You run the
gamut of emotions, reliving the whole thing.''
   Horgan said the grieving families ``can't complete the healing
process until those possessions are returned.''
   Matthew Coyle, who lost one of his 20-year-old twin daughters in
the bombing, said he and his wife came from their home in
Wallingford, Conn., to try to make some sense of the tragedy.
   ``It's a step,'' he said. ``I'm not sure where it's taking us but
it's a step.''
   Jeanine Boulanger of Shrewsbury said that because officials had
not recovered her 21-year-old daughter's body, she had pinned all
her hopes on retrieving some of the college student's possessions.
   ``She was an actress, a singer, a dancer and a poet,'' Mrs.
Boulanger said. ``These items, her journal, they're the only
tangible things we have to hold on to.''
   Newell flatly denied rumors that investigators had destroyed
victims' property.
   ``Nothing but nothing could be further from the truth,'' he said.
``But we want to make sure to clarify that for people ... who right
now have nothing.''
   Police have found and catalogued more than 11,000 items strewn
over 40 miles of Scottish countryside. But even though ownership has
been established and the property has been eliminated from the
criminal inquiry, most families are still waiting.
   Newell said the first property was returned in mid-February via
the U.S. Consulate in Edinburgh and that the process was continuing.
   In addition to those on board, 11 residents of Lockerbie were
killed when the wreckage of the Boeing 747 fell to the ground after
an explosion. The plane was en route from London to New York.
   Investigators have traced the bomb to a portable radio packed
with the luggage, but have not yet established what person or group
was responsible.
   The Scottish officers also met over the weekend with about 120
families in New York. They were scheduled to travel to Detroit on
Monday and Canton, Ohio, on Tuesday before returning home.

<HEAD>Report Police Increase Security for Leading Britons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have increased security around leading
figures following reports of an IRA assassination squad at large in
Britain and a list of prominent people found at a bomb-making site
in London, Press Association reported.
   The domestic news agency says police think the Irish Republican
Army unit, identified by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd on Wednesday,
may be working from a list of political and public figures similar
to one found Dec. 21 in a south London IRA bomb factory.
   ``We can confirm that a number of names of people prominent in
public life in Britain were found on a list in the house in Clapham
in December,'' Scotland Yard said Saturday. ``Each individual named
has been given suitable security advice.''
   Scotland Yard did not disclose who was on the list found in
Clapham nor say how many names it contained.
   The discovery of a cache of Semtex explosive and firearms in
woods near the northern coastal resort of Scarborough on Tuesday as
well as 22 pounds of the explosive in a London reservoir led the
Anti-Terrorist Squad to issue the warnings to leading figures, Press
Association said.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and senior Cabinet ministers are
to address a Conservative Party meeting in Scarborough's Crown Hotel
on Friday.
   Scotland Yard never discusses the security of individuals or
reveals details of any armed escorts. Press Association, however,
said it understood that a number of people thought to be on the list
have been given round-the-clock protection.
   The IRA has been waging a violent campaign to drive the British
out of the largely Protestant province of Northern Ireland and unite
it with the predominantly Roman Catholic Republic Ireland.
   On Wednesday, Hurd said a small gang equipped with explosives and
guns was at large in Britain. The government and security services
say the unit might be planning a bombing campaign on the British
mainland.
   The group is thought to have been responsible for the Aug. 1 bomb
blast at army barracks at Mill Hill, north London, which killed one
soldier and injured nine, and another blast at Ternhill, Shrewsbury,
Feb. 20. Only one soldier was injured in that bombing.

   An audience of 4,000 booed the jury's
selection of a Norwegian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest and
callers jammed the switchboard of Norway's NRK broadcasting company
to protest.
   The 25-member jury in the Stavanger Forum hall picked three of
nine songs entered for a final round.
   Britt Synnoeve Johansen performed the winning song, ``Closeness
of Friends,'' and the audience booed. The song was written by Inge
Enoksen and Leif Groette.
   The audience favored Jahn Teigen, a three-time national winner,
and his song ``Optimist.''
   ``Closeness of Friends'' will be Norway's entry in the 1989

   ``It was quite unconfortable to be among the three finalists and
hear the audience loudly express they wanted others on stage,'' said
Ingeborg Hungnes of Molde who presented the song that placed third.

<TEXT>
   One of just two known sets of the records
of one of the last chapters of World War II is slowly falling apart.
   The brittle, yellowing records include copies of the briefs filed
by attorneys in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East
_ a panel of judges from 11 countries who tried Japan's military and
civilian leaders for war crimes.
   Printed on inexpensive paper and bound by string or paper clips,
they sit in two file cabinets in the rare book room of Gonzaga
University's Crosby Library.
   ``The quality of the paper and the printing is such that they
will decay over time,'' said Bob Burr, Gonzaga's library director.
   Burr, convinced the documents have great historical value, said
he is seeking grants to help preserve them. The documents include
the indictments and verdicts against 28 Japanese leaders and a
129-page list of atrocities committed against prisoners.
   They were apparently reproduced on a type of mimeograph machine,
using whatever paper was available in war-torn Japan between 1946
and 1948.
   The only other known copy of the tribunal records is in the
National Archives, unindexed and reproduced on the same cheap paper.
   The documents were donated to the university last year by Daniel
Mahoney, a retired Spokane attorney whose late father, Willis
Mahoney, was acting chief prosecutor at the trials' conclusion.
   The tribunal was the Japanese counterpart of the Nuremburg trials
of the Nazi high command. It convicted 25 Japanese leaders,
including War Minister Hideki Tojo, who was ordered executed along
with six others.
   Others were sentenced to prison for life or given long sentences.
   Although complete records of the 1946 Nuremburg trials have been
published, the records of the Far East tribunal have not, Burr said.
   ``It's an asset that's priceless,'' Mahoney said. ``I don't want
anything to happen to it.''
   His father, a lawyer, went to Japan in 1946 to assist chief
prosecutor Joseph Keenan, and became acting chief prosecutor when
Keenan fell ill.
   When the trials concluded, the elder Mahoney sent one set of
records to the National Archives and brought another set home to
Portland, Ore. He later gave the set to his son, with instructions
they eventually be donated to Gonzaga, where both Mahoneys attended
law school.
   ``I've read very little, but the little I've read is
fascinating,'' Mahoney said.
   Burr said he may seek grants to place the documents on microfilm,
a project that is tentatively estimated to cost as much as $20,000.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Clergy Predict Black-White Church Split Will Persist</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa's main Afrikaner
church is likely to remain estranged from its black and mixed-race
counterparts despite its latest and most explicit repudiation of
apartheid, two dissident white clergymen said Sunday.
   Beyers Naude and Nico Smith, ministers who left the white Dutch
Reformed Church to join its black offspring, wrote newspaper
articles suggesting an irrevocable split was likely because of the
white church leadership's reluctance to support concrete
anti-apartheid action.
   Naude and Smith were assessing a five-day conference they
attended last week, aimed at finding common ground among the church
branches on racial issues.
   During the conference the white church, to which President P.W.
Botha and most of his Cabinet belong, declared apartheid a sin.
   However, delegates from the white church did not endorse a
resolution advocating civil disobedience to oppose apartheid and did
not join in a call for the abolition of specific racial segregation
laws.
   Smith, who broke from the white church in 1982 and now is a
pastor in a black township, wrote in the Sunday Times that the
conference was ``in many ways a dialogue of the deaf.''
   ``Those belonging to the world of the oppressor could not hear or
understand the cries and anger of those living in the world of the
oppressed,'' he wrote. ``The white church was once again exposed as
a captive of the Afrikaner volk (people) and the Nationalist
government.''
   Naude, whose split with the white church dates back to the 1960s,
wrote in the Sunday Star newspaper that ``the already fragile thread
of fellowship may be irrevocably broken'' if whites react
unsympathetically to the strong anti-apartheid resolutions adopted
by the black and mixed-race delegates.
   One area of common ground established at the conference was
opposition to the 33-month-old state of emergency, during which the
government has detained thousands of black activists.
   Leaders of the white, black and mixed-race churches reportedly
plan to make a joint appeal to the government to lift the emergency
and halt detention without trial.
   Sunday was designated by activists across South Africa as
National Detainees Day, and church services were held in several
communities to express solidarity with those held without charge.

<HEAD>Big Sun Explosions Continue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLOMAN AIR FORCE BASE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three more large solar
flares, each with the potential to disrupt radio transmissions and
trigger aurora borealis, have erupted on the sun in a wake of an
unusually large blast, researchers say.
   A blast 36 times the size of Earth that occurred Thursday on the
sun's northeast quadrant was possibly the largest ever recorded,
researchers at Holloman Air Force Base said.
   Staff Sgt. Leroy Kirkegard said Saturday that the huge eruption
of gas from the surface of the sun was followed by another large
explosion Friday morning and three more on Saturday. He said the
flare Thursday measured a 4-brilliant rating, while the blast Friday
measured a 3-brilliant.
   Flares that are big enough to disrupt radio transmissions are
rated by astronomers from zero-brilliant to 4-brilliant, he said.
   The three blasts that occurred Saturday, also in the northeast
quadrant, each rated 2-brilliant, he said.
   ``That's uncommon _ to have that many big flares in the same
region in the same day,'' Kirkegard said.
   ``It's a very disturbed area _ probably two to three Earths in
diameter,'' said Tom Folkers, a technical specialist and telescope
operator at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Ariz.
   Thursday's solar flare extended some 70,000 miles into space,
said researchers at Sacramento Peak, just east of Holloman and
Alamogordo.
   ``The report I got from Sacramento Peak ... is it's the largest
one they've seen _ ever,'' said astronomer Tom Duvall at Kitt Peak.
``This is pretty exciting for us up here.''
   Air Force Maj. James B. Near Jr., commander of Holloman's solar
observatory in the Sacramento Mountains, said Friday the flare was
the size of 36 Earths.
   The violent eruptions created the potential to disrupt long-range
communications on Earth _ such as short-wave transmissions and
satellite links, researchers said.
   Folkers said ultraviolet radiation and X-rays hit the Earth's
upper atmosphere at noon Thursday, just eight minutes after the
solar blast. Such radiation travels at the speed of light, he said.
   Slower-moving particles are expected to pelt the outer atmosphere
for days as a result of Thursday's flare, he said.
   ``What happens when you have a solar flare is that the cosmic
particles hit the ionosphere and shatter it,'' Folkers said.
   The ionosphere, about 120 miles above the Earth's surface,
normally acts like a mirror, reflecting radio transmissions back to
the surface, said Folkers, who said he studies solar flares as a
hobby.
   After it is disrupted by the solar particles, the ionosphere
gradually reassembles and regains its reflective ability, he said.
In the meantime, he said, people listening to short-wave broadcasts
might notice that stations tend to fade out.
   He also said there may be more aurora borealis sightings in
coming days as the solar particles interact with the earth's
magnetic field.

   Thousands of pro-democrats demonstrated in Moscow
and Leningrad on Sunday, while thousands of Latvians rallied in
support of a grass-roots political organization, organizers said.
   Police arrested about 100 protesters in the Moscow and Leningrad
protests, one activist said.
   The demonstrators in Moscow, estimated at 1,500, unfurled the
white, blue and red flag of Russia that flew after the February
Revolution in 1917, during the eight months of shaky attempts to
found a democracy before the Bolsheviks took over, the activist said.
   An estimated 200,000 people marched in Riga, the Latvian capital,
to express support for the aims of the Latvian People's Front, which
has come under fire from a Russian nationalist group, one of the
protesters said.
   Boris Sokolov of the People's Front said the protest in the
Latvian capital was the biggest protest ever seen in that Soviet
republic.
   Thousands gathered in a downtown square to counter increasing
pressure on the People's Front from Interfront, a largely Russian
organization that has organized at least one strike to protest
People's Front moves to restore Latvian as the republic's dominant
language, Sokolov said in a telephone interview.
   Some people carried placards calling for Latvian independence and
favoring the language law. Participants agreed to send a message to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the Latvian parliament favoring
democratization, Sokolov said.
   The rally ended peacefully and no arrests were made, he said.
   The Democratic Union, a fledgling political party in a nation
that bans any alternative to the ruling communists, organized the
Moscow and Leningrad demonstrations. The People's Front, unlike the
Democratic Union, claims broad-based support and has worked with the
Communist Party and local authorities to pursue its reform program.
   The Leningrad protest, against allegedly undemocratic sections in
a new election law, drew 7,000 people and 1,500 police and crowd
control officers, said Yuri Mityunov of the Democratic Union in
Moscow. He said authorities detained 65 people.
   About 1,500 people attended the demonstration on Moscow's
Mayakovsky Square and 40 people were detained, he said. It was not
clear if charges would be filed.
   In the Volga River city of Kuibyshev, 300 people marched 2 miles
down city streets Sunday to mark the anniversary of the February
revolution, and 100 of them continued the meeting in a factory hall,
Mityunov said.
   They carried placards with such slogans as, ``Political
opposition is the guarantee of democracy.''
   The Kuibyshev protest proceeded unhindered after the organizers
threatened a group hunger strike and Western media coverage of any
repressive measures, Mityunov said.

   Embattled Navajo Chairman Peter
MacDonald ordered two tribal officials fired and locks on two
buildings changed, prompting a predecessor to say Sunday that the
move represented ``a police state.''
   MacDonald has been under fire since witnesses, including his son,
told a U.S. Senate select committee last month that he had taken
kickbacks and bribes from companies wanting to do business with the
nation's largest Indian tribe.
   The latest developments came after a meeting Friday by 44
dissident members of the 88-member Tribal Council. The dissidents
elected an interim chairman and vice chairman and placed Vice
Chairman Johnny R. Thompson on administrative leave.
   That same day, MacDonald's staff was ordered to fire James
Henderson, director of the legislative affairs office, and Henderson
aide Larry Foster, said Alyce Rouwalk, assistant area director for
the Navajo office of the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs.
   MacDonald has accused Henderson and Foster of siding with the
dissidents.
   Late Friday, tribal police were ordered to change the locks on
the council building and the legislative office, said Ms. Rouwalk.
   Former Tribal Chairman Peterson Zah said in an interview Sunday
on Phoenix radio station KFYI that MacDonald's move was uncalled for
and represented another case of ``excessive use of police force on
this reservation.''
   ``So in essence, the bottom line is we really have a police state
here,'' Zah said.
   Following the Senate committee hearings, the council voted Feb.
17 to place MacDonald on leave, but he has maintained he is still in
charge.
   MacDonald spokeswoman Pazbah McCullah said Saturday the chairman
had no comment on Friday's events. No one could be reached for
comment Sunday because tribal offices were closed.
   Approximately 150,000 of the Navajos' 200,000 members live on the
reservation, which includes much of northeastern Arizona as well as
parts of northwestern New Mexico and southeastern Utah.

   Skeeter Vaughan, a Cherokee Inidian whose
knife-throwing and tomahawk skills led him to a career as actor and
stuntman in movies and television, has died of a heart attack at age
66.
   Vaughan died Wednesday while dining with friends in nearby Port
Angeles, said his daughter, Cherokee Vaughan Dykes.
   Vaughan appeared in more than 100 movies, television shows and
commercials. His film credits included ``The Last of the Mohicans,''
``Revolution,'' and ``The Great White Hope.'' His TV work included
``Magnum P.I.,'' ``Gunsmoke'' and ``The Six Million Dollar Man.''
   Vaughan was also a charter member of the Hollywood Stuntmen's

   Vaughan, whose Indian name was Grey Otter, was born on a
reservation in California and grew up near Pendleton, Ore. He began
his show business career at age 12 in a traveling medicine show as a
knife and tomahawk thrower.
   In addition to Mrs. Dykes, he is survived by two other daughters,
a son and two granddaughters.

   About 2,500 veterans and supporters from nine
states marched Sunday at the Art Institute of Chicago to demand that
officials remove a U.S. flag placed on the floor in an art student's
exhibit.
   At one point, participants in the most recent of a series of
protests attacked about a dozen students holding a
counterdemonstration, swinging fists and throwing hot coffee. Police
intervened, and no one was injured.
   A veteran and four students were arrested, said Police Officer
Mark Halco.
   The veteran was charged with battery; two students were charged
with disorderly conduct and the other two were charged with criminal
damage to property for painting flags on the sidewalk in an effort
to force demonstrators to walk on the flag, Halco said.
   Police led the students to a corner two blocks away from the
demonstrators and surrounded them with barricades.
   The flag-waving protesters, led by local politicians and leaders
of veterans groups, chanted, ``One, two, three, four, get the flag
off the floor.''
   ``This symbol of our nation, it is sacred. It cannot be
desecrated,'' Tom Stack, organizer of the protest. ``The First
Amendment has limits.''
   Another group of about 20 counterdemonstrators, primarily artists
from the Chicago area, stood nearby under heavy police guard. They
carried empty picture frames on sticks, which they said showed the
exhibit being protested was essentially ``empty'' of artistic merit,
but that the rights of artists to free expression should be upheld.
   ``This is a misguided protest,'' Barry Casilly, 31, said of the
veterans' protest. ``They're trampling all over everything the flag
stands for.''
   The flag, part of an exhibit of 66 minority artists' work,
features the Stars and Stripes positioned in such a way that viewrs
are likely to step on it. The work also shows photos of flag-draped
coffins and South Koreans burning the flag.
   Protests began about a week after the exhibit, titled ``What is
the Proper Way to Display a U.S. Flag?'' opened Feb. 17. Veterans
and others have tried several times to remove the flag. A Circuit
Court rejected a lawsuit contending the work desecrates the flag.
   ``I just think it's a sin to have the flag on the floor,'' said
Vietnam veteran Michael Boorsma, 38, of suburban Batavia. ``It
bothers me tremendously.''
   Student artist ``Dread'' Scott Tyler on Saturday called his
exhibit revolutionary, and said he had no apologies.
   The exhibit opened for a few minutes Sunday morning, but was
closed after veterans repeatedly picked up the flag, said security
guard Alicia Lloyd.
   Veterans came to the demonstration from Illinois, Wisconsin, West
Virginia, Michigan, Indiana, Oklahoma, New York, Vermont, and
Arkansas. The crowd overflowed from the sidewalk in front of the
building, closing busy Michigan Avenue.
   State Sen. Walter Dudycz, who has demonstrated against the work
at the School of the Art Institute almost daily since the
controversy began, said he would co-sponsor legislation to toughen
laws against desecrating the flag.
   The Republican lawmaker and GOP mayoral candidate Edward Vrdolyak
distributed a list of corporate sponsors of the Art Institute, and
urged a letter-writing campaign to pressure them into cutting off
funding.
   ``We want them to know their money is supporting an institution
that is desecrating the American flag,'' Dudycz said.
   Vietnam veteran Terry Hueser, 43, burned his Art Institute
membership card and said he would no longer support the institution.

<TEXT>
   Police on Sunday recovered the last bodies
from the crash site of an Air Ontario jet. Investigators said the
plane's voice and flight recorders were destroyed, making it harder
to find the cause of the crash that killed 24 people.
   The chief investigator of the Canadian Aviation Safety Board, Joe
Jackson, would not rule out the possibility that snow and sleet on
the wings of the Fokker F-28 contributed to Friday's crash.
   Sixty-nine people were on board the Dutch-built jet when it took
off from Dryden for Winnipeg, Manitoba and crashed a half mile away
from the runway.
   ``All of the bodies that were in the burned-out fuselage have
been removed,'' said Ontario provincial police constable Bill
Brayshaw.
   Twelve more bodies were recovered Sunday, bringing the total of
bodies recovered to 22. Two of the 47 survivors died in hospitals.
   Police attributed the slow process of recovering the bodies to
the thigh-deep snow and rough terrain at the site.
   A temporary morgue was set up at the hockey arena in this
paper-mill town of 6,500 people 200 miles northwest of Duluth, Minn.
on the Trans-Canada Highway.
   Plans were made to send the burned bodies to Toronto on Monday
for identification.
   Investigators said Sunday that the plane's two black boxes melted
in the fire that followed the crash.
   ``It will make the investigation tougher,'' said Jackson. He said
the boxes were at the tail end of the plane, away from the main
fire, and he did not know why they were so badly damaged.
   As local churches in Dryden held memorial services for the
victims, Air Ontario denied allegations by some survivors that the
twin-engine jet crashed because it was overloaded or had too much
snow or ice on the wings.
   Paul McKnight, vice president of the regional commuter airline
based in London, Ontario, told reporters the plane was not
overloaded and the pilot was experienced in flying in bad weather.
   But Jackson did not rule out the possibility that the wings had
too much slush or snow.
   ``There are indications from various sources that the wings were
contaminated with snow and slush,'' said Jackson. ``We've been
trying to find material evidence to prove there was snow and slush
on the wings.''
   McKnight said the damage to the plane, which broke into three
pieces, was so extensive that ``it indeed was a miracle'' that 45
people survived.
   The plane's pilot, Capt. George Morwood, 52, of London, was one
of three crew members who died in the crash. The other crew member,
a stewardess, survived.
   Air Ontario said it would not release a passenger list until all
the fatalities were identified.
   The last fatal crash in Canada of a regularly scheduled
commercial flight was in 1979, when a Quebecair Fairchild 27 went
down in Quebec City, killing 17 people.
   Canada's worst air disaster occurred in 1985, when 256 people,
mainly American servicemen returning to Kentucky from the Middle
East, died in the crash of a chartered DC-8 in Gander, Newfoundland.

controversy has worsened relations between Moslem extremists and the
West and made his release seem unlikely.
   ``The situation has fallen apart again,'' Peggy Say said after a
prayer service for Anderson in his hometown in upstate New York.
``It seems like every time we get close, something unpredictable
happens.''
   Immediately after President Bush's inauguration in January, there
were signs that Anderson might soon be freed after nearly four years
in captivity in Beruit, Lebanon, according to Mrs. Say. She didn't
specify what signs, but said the political climate at the time was
more encouraging than it had been in many months.
   But she said she feared that the animosity that has arisen over
publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' by British author Salman
Rushdi has damaged the political climate and made the release of
Western hostages more remote.
   The Iranian government has called for Rusdie's death on the
grounds that the novel is blasphemous.
   ``The situation now is not very good,'' Mrs. Say said. ``But
we're not going to give up.''
   Anderson, 41, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beruit. He is the
longest held of 13 foreign hostages.
   About 100 residents of Batavia listened to a roll call of the
hostages in a high school gymnasium and heard Mrs. Say urge them not
to allow Anderson to be forgotten.
   Mrs. Say believes that if Anderson's captors think the American
people no longer care about the hostages, they will be killed.
   ``Terry is counting us to keep his cause alive,'' she said.
   Earlier, the Rev. David Scheider, principal of Notre Dame High
School, appealed for the nation to show support for the hostages.
Scheider said Anderson's plight should be viewed from a humanitarian
standpoint and not politically.
   Ex-hostages report that Anderson is being held in a closet
blindfolded and has been beaten by his captors.
   The service in Batavia was the first of a number of observances
as Anderson enters his fifth year of captivity. Another service is
planned Monday in Buffalo, N.Y., with Mrs. Say and the Rev. Lawrence
Jenco, who was imprisoned with Anderson for a time in the Middle
East.
   Ex-hostages and hostage families will gather in Washington on
Thursday for a service sponsored by the Journalists Committee to
Free Terry Anderson and a group known as No Greater Love.
   There also will be a service in Lorain, Ohio, Anderson's
birthplace. Anderson moved to upstate New York when he was 6 and
graduated from Batavia High School in 1965.

<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II sent a message Monday to the 48
members of the British Commonwealth, saying they had a particular
role in combating the global threat of pollution.
   It was the queen's Commonwealth Day message to the organization
of Britain and its colonies and followed speeches given last week by
Prince Philip, her husband, and Prince Charles, her son, on damage
to the Earth's resources.
   She said nothing during the past year underlined world
interdependence more forcefully than the growth in awareness of the
serious dangers man's own activities pose to the environment.
   ``The threat to the environment takes many forms, of which some
are so far reaching that it is difficult to grasp them,'' she said.
   ``We hear, for example, of the possibility of radical changes in
our climate leading, among other things, to a rise in the sea level,
with all that would mean for small islands and low-lying regions.''
   The Commonwealth's concern for resources means partnership not
only across the oceans but also between generations, she said.
   Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, addressed an
international conference in London last week and appealed for the
elimination of chlorofluorocarbon gases, which are destroying the
ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful radiation from the
sun.
   In a lecture last week Prince Philip spoke of the pressures of
having to produce increasing amounts of food to feed growing
populations and the strain that placed on the Earth's resources.

<HEAD>Municpal Elections in France Marked By Record Low Turnout</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French voted Sunday for new city councils in
elections marked by a record low turnout, slight progress for
leftist parties and the surprising emergence of the ecologists.
   The Socialists and Communists, who had squabbled for months over
the formation of joint lists of candidates, lost some of their
support to the greens, as the Ecologist Party is known.
   The traditional right and center-right parties, the Rally for the
Republic and Union for French Democracy, suffered in some areas at
the hands of the extreme-right National Front.
   Turnout was estimated at between 70-73.5 percent _ the lowest for
municipal elections since the end of World War II. Turnout in the
last municipal elections in 1983 was 78.4 percent.
   In municipalities where no list won an absolute majority a second
round of voting will be held next Sunday. That balloting will
include all lists that received at least 10 percent of the first
vote.
   With about 70 percent of the vote reported Sunday night, the
ecologists, never previously a force in France, were expected to win
between 4 and 5 percent of the vote nationally and more in some
areas, such as 12.8 percent in Strasbourg and 14 percent in St.
Brieuc.
   In Lille in northern France, where the mayor is Pierre Mauroy,
head of the nation's governing Socialist Party, the greens won 8.4
percent.
   Antoine Waechter, head of the ecologists, said his party was
``demonstrating that they are a political force that is implanting
itself here as they are in other European countries.
   ``Public opinion is becoming aware of the gravity of the
ecological crisis and the absence of will by successive governments,
no matter what their political color, to deal with it.''
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front leader who won 14.4 percent
of the vote in the first round of the presidential election last
spring, praised what he called his party's ``remarkable success.''
   ``The National Front has created the only novelty of this
election because in 1983 it counted only 0.11 percent of the vote
... today it could be credited with 7 percent on the national
level,'' Le Pen said.
   ``When you take into account that we did not present candidates
in all cities ... that's a remarkable success.''
   Municipal elections generally are fought on local issues but the
results can provide a sense of the national power of the parties.
Few significant changes were noted in Sunday's voting.
   Socialist Premier Michel Rocard said the vote confirmed ``the
great choices that the president and the government have proposed to
the country.''
   Marcel Debarge, a national secretary of President Francois
Mitterrand's Socialist Party, said there was ``an unspectacular gain
by the left, a certain loss by the traditional right and a stronger
than expected resistance by the National Front, which I regret.''
   Charles Pasqua, a leading figure in the conservative Rally for
the Republic, said his party would make no deals with the National
Front in the runoff elections.Le Pen called that attitude ``the road
to suicide.''
   Voting took place in 36,757 communities.
   In France's three largest cities, Paris, Marseille and Lyon,
there appeared to be no big shakeups.
   Conservative Mayor Jacques Chirac was in no danger of losing
control of Paris, though it appeared he would not sweep all 20 of
the city's districts as he did six years ago.
   Warfare in Marseille between two Socialist lists, one official
and the other unofficial, did not appear to benefit the right.
   In Lyon, conservative former Trade Minister Michel Noir was
virtually assured of ousting center-right Mayor Francisque Collomb.
   Disgruntled with a Socialist-Communist government, the French
used the 1983 municipal elections to protest, allowing the right to
take over many city halls previously held by the left.
   This time, with Mitterrand and Rocard still riding comfortably
high in the popularity polls, there seemed to be less of a protest
vote.
   The Socialist and Communist parties agreed to run joint lists of
candidates in only about 60 percent of towns with more than 20,000
residents. Conservative and centrist candidates shared a slate of
candidates in about 95 percent of those towns.

<TEXT>
   Police wielding bamboo canes pushed back
Tibetan women who tried to march to Parliament Sunday to protest
Chinese rule and violence in their homeland.
   About 20 women sustained scrapes and scratches, either from the
police officers' bamboo canes or from falling on the gravel when
they tried to push through a metal barricade. Parliament was not in
session at the time.
   Clashes between Tibetan demonstrators and Chinese police last
week in Lhasa, Tibet's capital, left 16 people dead and more than
100 wounded by China's official count. Western travelers said the
death toll was higher and could be 20 or 30.
   The killings occurred during protests that began a few days
before the anniversary of the March 10, 1959 uprising in Tibet that
was quashed by China.
   Sunday's demonstration in New Delhi was timed to coincide with
the 30th anniversary of the day thousands of Tibetan women staged
freedom marches in Lhasa as men stayed indoors out of fear for their
safety.
   On March 17, 1959, the Tibetans' spiritual and temporal leader,
the Dalai Lama, fled across the Himalayas to India, where he remains
in exile with about 100,000 other Tibetans.
   After New Delhi police thwarted Sunday's march about a mile from
Parliament, about 200 women staged a peaceful protest beside India
Gate, the huge stone arch honoring Indian soldiers who died in the
service of their British colonial rulers.
   As they chanted slogans calling for an end to Chinese rule, at
least a half-dozen of the women fainted in the midday sun and were
carried to shade trees by young women wearing T-shirts that read
``Free Tibet'' and ``Stop Repression in Tibet.''
   The Dalai Lama, revered by Tibetan Buddhists as their god-king,
has said he would accept Chinese control of military and foreign
policy in Tibet in exchange for greater autnomy.
   Tibetans say their homeland was independent before the Chinese
invasion in 1949, but China maintains it had been an integral part
of China for centuries.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Link Between Sex Hormones and Skeletal System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli researchers have found a link between
sex hormones and the skeletal system of animals, opening the way to
a better understanding of osteoporosis, the Weizmann Institute of
Science said Sunday.
   The findings could help explain the high incidence of the
degenerative bone disease in women following menopause, a statement
from the institute said.
   The institute discovered in recent experiments with laboratory
rats that the skeletal system responds to the animal's main sex
hormone, the institute's statement said.
   Osteoporosis is characterized by increased porousness and
brittleness in bones associated with the loss of calcium. It leads
to an increased risk of fracture.
   An estimated 15 to 20 million people suffer from the disease in
the United States alone, resulting in an annual total of 1.3 million
fractures with a mortality rate of 5 to 14 percent, according to
figures from the institute. There is no known cure, only methods of
slowing the progress of the disease.
   Although sex hormone deficiency has been associated with
osteoporosis and such hormones have been used for treatment, the
disease was believed to result from processes only indirectly
related to hormone deficiency, said institute spokesman Nehemiah
Myers.
   The research team was led by Professor Alvin M. Kaye of the
institute's hormone research and included his associates from Tel
Aviv University.
   The study is to be published in the ``Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences of the United States.''
   The research shows that bones of female rats respond biologically
to the female hormone estrogen but are unaffected by its male
counterpart, testosterone. In male rats, bone tissue is stimulated
selectively by testosterone.
   But Kaye added: ``the situation in bones is quite complex, and
the stimulatory effects of estrogen and testosterone here are
closely linked to other factors,'' including the level of vitamin D
metabolites.
   ``The interdependence of these reactions could help explain why
there has never been a clear association between the level of blood
estrogen and the appearance of osteoporosis,'' Kaye said.
   Osteoporosis is much more prevalent in women, who may undergo an
80 percent reduction in estrogen production following menopause, the
institute said. It noted that men show only a moderate lowering of
testosterone levels.
   Kaye is a professor of endocrinology at the institute, which is a
leading Israeli research facility in the natural sciences. It is in
Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv.

   Most people expect to find firearms at a shooting
range and art in a museum. But the new King County Police range will
combine the two with a sculpture made of guns.
   Artist Tom Brennan has melted down more than 100 firearms
confiscated by police to create the sculpture that will be mounted
outside the shooting range next month.
   John Hosford, executive director of the Citizens Committee for
the Right to Keep and Bear Arms and a retired police officer, called
Brennan's project a ``totally inappropriate use of public funds''
and said the artist is using weapons to create an image that ``guns
are bad.''
   Brennan makes no bones about it.
   The artist, who lives in a high-crime area in central Seattle,
said his piece takes items with ``bad vibes'' and turns them into
something pleasing and gentle.
   ``At least I'm taking some of these weapons out of circulation. I
would like to take more,'' the 37-year-old artist said of the
sawed-off shotguns, handguns and other objects in his sculpture.
   The $8,000 project for the range was funded by the King County
Arts Commission.
   King County Police Officer George Minnich, who for 20 years has
overseen the property room where confiscated guns are stored, said
all the weapons given to Brennan were unsafe or illegal and must be
destroyed by law anyway.
   ``It gives us a good place to get rid of them,'' he said.
   ``It's better than some other uses I've seen for them,'' agreed a
colleague, police Lt. Roy Weaver.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of 45 Moslem states and
the PLO meet Monday at a conference that will likely be dominated by
Saudi-Iranian clashes over ethics and politics.
   This kingdom has refused to suppport Iran's death order against
British novelist Salman Rushdie, and it is not expected to change
its position at the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
   The Saudis also are expected to clash with Iran over the question
of recognition of the Afghan guerrilla government.
   Arab diplomatic sources said Iran sent a delegation to Riyadh on
Saturday for meetings to set the agenda for the four-day conference
but that the delegation returned to Tehran without taking part in
the meetings.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said an Iranian delegation
headed by the deputy chief of the Islamic Propagation Organization,
Mohammad Ali Taskhiri, left Tehran Sunday to attend the conference.
   Conference Secretary-General Hamed al-Ghabid confirmed the
conference will take up the issue of Rushdie's controversial novel,
``The Satanic Verses,'' which some say blasphemes Islam.
   Saudi Arabia's 16 million people are mainly Sunni Moslems. Iran's
50 million people overwhelmingly belong to the Shiite Moslem sect,
long at odds with the Sunnis.
   Most Sunnis agree with Iran that ``The Satanic Verses'' should be
banned. But they have stopped short of supporting Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's call Feb. 14 for Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie, an
Indian-born Moslem who lives in Britain.
   Shiites comprise one-tenth of the world's 1 billion Moslems, and
the Iranians are clearly outnumbered in their bid to gain support
for the death threat.
   But Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Khomeini apparently wants to press ahead in an effort to persuade
Moslems to view and support his campaign as a defense of Islam
against the West.
   Two Iranian government envoys have been touring Islamic states
seeking support for Iran's stance on the Rushdie affar. Ahmad
Jannati was in Bahrain on Sunday, and Mohammad Yazdi was in Nigeria.
   The Rushdie affair is discussed daily by the Iranian media. Saudi
newspapers have made no mention of it.
   Fourteen nations have withdrawn their top diplomats from Iran in
protest of Khomeini's death sentence.
   The Saudis and Iranians have not had diplomatic relations since
April, when Saudi Arabia broke ties, citing terrorism and subversion.
   One reason for the rupture was what the Saudis called
Iranian-inspired riots during the 1987 annual Moslem pilgrimage to
Mecca. More than 400 people, most of them Iranians, were killed.
   Khomeini has long challenged the Saudi royal family's
guardianship of Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   On the Afghan issue, Saudi Arabia has been a key supporter of
Sunni Afghan guerrillas who fought the Soviets until the Red Army
withdrew from Afghanistan last month after nine years of
intervention.
   The Saudis have recognized the so-called interim Afghan
government an alliance of Pakistan-based Sunni guerrillas formed
last month, and are pressing other Moslem nations to do so. Sudan
followed suit on Saturday and several other Moslem states are
expected to act soon.
   Iran, however, has backed Shiite Moslem guerrillas in the Afghan
civil war. Those insurgents operate from Iran and are not
represented in the interim government.
   Pakistan, which has a large Shiite minority, sent its foreign
minister, Sahabzadah Yacoub Khan, to Iran Saturday. Arab diplomatic
sources said he was seeking to arrange a compromise between the
guerrilla factions.

   After trying to blame leftist
rebels, the military Sunday admitted responsibility for the Sept. 21
slaying of 10 peasants and said nine soldiers, including two
officers, will stand trial for the massacre.
   The slayings and subsequent cover-up were ``a grave violation of
normal operating procedures,'' said an armed forces statement.
   It said an intelligence unit major, a second lieutenant, two
staff sergeants, a corporal and four privates from the 5th Brigade's
Jiboa Battalion ``will be turned over to civilian judicial
authorities'' to stand trial.
   Col. Jose Emilio Chavez Caceres, a brigade officer relieved of
his command, will be reinstated because he was innocent of any
wrongdoing and was lied to by his subordinates, it said.
   ``I think it's a breakthrough,'' Ambassador William Walker said
of Sunday's developments.
   ``The high command of the armed forces is admitting that ...
their earlier versions have not held up under examination and were
wrong, scurrilous,'' he told a group of reporters.
   But Walker said it was too early to say if the massacre case
marked a real change in the military's traditional impunity in human
rights abuses.
   At first, the military claimed the peasants were rebels who
ambushed a Jiboa Battalion patrol and were killed in ``fierce
combat'' in the hamlet of San Francisco, near brigade headquarters
in San Vicente, a city 36 miles east of San Salvador.
   However, news reports quoting witnesses said a 33-man patrol
marched into San Francisco, rounded up the village's 15 families in
the schoolhouse, separated the 10 peasants and accused them of
collaborating with guerrillas.
   Witnesses said the seven men and three women were taken to a
nearby ravine, tied up, blindfolded and killed with hand grenades.
Some witnesses said they also heard bursts of rifle fire after the
explosions.
   The next day, the rest of the villagers found the bodies in the
ravine covered with a banner of the Farabundo Marti Liberation Front
rebel coalition, witnesses said.
   The military claimed the peasants were killed after being
detained for ``involvement in the activities of subversive
organizations'' and possessing explosives and propaganda.
   Sunday's statement said an investigation found the soldiers had
lied to their superiors and that Maj. Mauricio Beltran Granados, an
intelligence officer, had ordered the peasants killed.
   It was the worst mass slaying of civilians in four years in El
Salvador. The United States, which provides El Salvador with an
average of $1.5 million daily in military and economic aid, has been
pressing the government to bring those responsible to justice.
   During a visit in February, Vice President Dan Quayle insisted
that those responsible be sought and tried. Walker, who rarely
leaves the capital because of the war, visited the provincial judge
handling the case to stress U.S. interest in the affair.
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war
began more than nine years ago.

   Rescuers on Sunday called off their
search for a Minnesota pilot who ditched his small plane in the
frigid Atlantic Ocean four days ago.
   Todd Michaelson, 29, of Minneapolis, was the lone occupant of the
single-engine Piper Saratoga. He reported engine troubles Wednesday
afternoon and went down a short time later.
   ``The search has been reduced which means resources have been
stood down,'' said Maj. Phil MacMillan of the Halifax Search and
rescue centre. ``A general marine broadcast has gone out to all
shipping in the area to keep an eye out.''
   Two British and one Canadian patrol plane and a Canadian research
vessel continued to search an area about 900 miles northeast of
Newfoundland until darkness fell Sunday.
   Michaelson, who was delivering the plane to Ireland for Orient
Air International of Minneapolis, had a life raft and survival suit
with him. A flare thought to have been fired by him was spotted late
Wednesday night and searchers later found some debris believed to be
from his plane.
   Search officials on Friday stopped hunting for a second small
plane that ditched in the same area as Michaelson's Thursday
morning. The pilot, an American in his 40s, was not identified.

<TEXT>
   When Shellie Wilkes was interviewing for a
job with the Peoria City-County Health Department, she wondered how
she'd ever handle the grim task of telling people they had AIDS or
were exposed to the disease.
   ``I remember asking myself how can anyone stand that kind of job
every day,'' said Mrs. Wilkes, program coordinator in the sexually
transmitted disease division.
   ``It can be depressing,'' she said. ``But ... if we've helped
others avoid getting infected with AIDS, then it's all worth it.''
   In the last nine months, she and other health department
employees across Illinois have been tracking down people who have
had dangerous contact with AIDS patients _ either through sexual
relations or sharing of hypodermic drug needles _ to break the news
that they may have been exposed to the deadly virus.
   A state law that took effect last July requires everyone who
tests positive for the AIDS virus to notify their sex partners or
anyone with whom they shared needles.
   The law allows victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome to
simply give the names of their partners to their local health
department and let officials spread the word.
   Illinois has been a leading state in passing legislation to fight
AIDS, including a law requiring AIDS tests for people seeking
marriage licenses. The law has been blamed for sending many couples
to adjoining states to get married.
   In Chicago, notification of possible AIDS infection is not
spreading as quickly as health officials would like because of a
lack of manpower.
   ``We do the best we can but we've only got two investigators to
cover the entire city,'' said Brian Chapman, director of Chicago's
AIDS surveillance unit. ``We've made about 70 or 80 notification
attempts and been successful on about 40 or 50.''
   He said the need to protect confidentiality also makes the job
difficult.
   ``People with AIDS are losing their jobs, their families, their
incomes,'' Chapman said. ``We must protect them and be discreet.''
   Like Mrs. Wilkes, Chapman finds the job depressing at times.
   ``The emotions go from A to Z,'' he said. ``Some people are
absolutely shocked. Others are not surprised. It can get to you. But
you have to view it with a professional eye.''
   Mrs. Wilkes is motivated by the need to educate people about the
dangers and facts of being exposed to AIDS.
   ``We try not to give them a false sense of hope,'' she said. ``We
also tell them that they aren't necessarily infected with AIDS
simply because they've been exposed to it.''
   Illinois Department of Public Health statistics show 2,580 cases
of AIDS have been reported in Illinois, with the bulk of those,
2,329, in the metropolitan Chicago area.
   A random survey of health departments in central Illinois only
produced a handful of instances where the AIDS notification law has
been invoked, but officials expect that phase of their job to grow
with the number of AIDS cases.
   Peoria County had its first case reported in 1984 and there were
seven last year, bringing the total to 14 _ half of which have been
fatal.

War II saga ``War and Rememberance'' won best miniseries in the 15th
annual People's Choice awards Sunday night.
   ``I'd like to accept this award on behalf of all the working moms
and housewives,'' said Ms. Barr, whose ABC-TV situation comedy
chronicles the life of a blue-collar mother.
   The comedian received more votes than ``Murphy Brown'' star
Candice Bergen or ``China Beach'' actress Dana Delaney in the
nationwide Gallup Organization poll that determined the awards.
   ``War and Rememberance,'' the globe-spanning story of a family
during World War II based on Herman Wouk's novel of the same name,
was picked over ``Favorite Son'' and ``Elvis and Me'' for best
miniseries. The ABC-TV miniseries' disappointing ratings had led to
predictions that the miniseries format might be doomed.
   ```War and Rememberance' was an enormous undertaking and one that
required an almost unbelievable commitment from everyone involved in
the production,'' said miniseries star Robert Mitchum, who accepted
the award from Charlton Heston.
   Ms. Barr, who received her award early in the two-hour nationally
telecast awards ceremony hosted by Michael Landon and Michele Lee,
was also nominated as best female performer with Phylicia Rashad and
Cybill Shepherd.
   ``Roseanne'' joined ``The Cosby Show'' and ``Cheers'' in the
nominations for best comedy series, while ``Roseanne'' also picked
up a nomination for best new comedy series with ``Murphy Brown'' and
``The Wonder Years.''
   ``The Cosby Show'' also was nominated with ``M-A-S-H'' and ``Star
Trek'' as best all-time television show.
   In addition to Ms. Barr, entertainers racking up multiple
nominations included Tom Selleck, Bill Cosby, Tom Cruise, Bette
Midler and Meryl Streep.
   Cosby was nominated as best male performer along with Selleck and
Michael J. Fox, and best all-around male star with Cruise and
Selleck.
   All-around female star nominations went to Cher, Ms. Midler and
Ms. Streep.
   For motion pictures, ``Rain Man'' was nominated as best drama
with ``Die Hard'' and ``Young Guns,'' and ``Rain Man'' stars Dustin
Hoffman and Cruise shared best dramatic actor nominations with Bruce
Willis.
   Nominated for best comedy films were ``Big,'' ``Coming to
America,'' and ``Twins,'' and best comedy actor nominations went to
Danny DeVito, Tom Hanks and Eddie Murphy.
   Jamie Lee Curtis, Ms. Midler and Priscilla Presley were nominated
for best comedy actresses, while best dramatic actress nominations
went to Glenn Close, Ms. Streep and Sigourney Weaver.
   Nominated for best all-time movie were ``E.T.: The
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Gone With The Wind'' and ``The Sound Of
Music.''
   Michael Jackson, George Michael and Randy Travis got nominations
for best male musical performer, and Whitney Houston, Reba McEntire
and Barbra Streisand captured nominations for best female musical
performer.
   Best music video nominations were given to Bobby McFerrin's
``Don't Worry, Be Happy,'' Michael Jackson's ``Smooth Criminal,''
and Tone Loc's ``Wild Thing.'

<HEAD>Dame Joan Sutherland Sings Solo at Met</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No PMs Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dame Joan Sutherland, opera's most famous
coloratura soprano, who made her Metropolitan Opera debut in ``Lucia
di Lammermoor'' in 1961 to great acclaim, sang her first solo
recital at the Met on Sunday and again deserved the acclaim she
received.
   Her husband, conductor Richard Bonynge, was her deferential piano
accompanist.
   Dame Joan has spent most of her career in the bel canto opera
repertoire, singing soprano parts written to show off the sound of
the voice, its beauty, flexibility and accuracy, with much less
emphasis on the words.
   She chose that type of song and aria for her recital. She's still
a singer well worth hearing, who can be greatly enjoyed and
appreciated.
   For the most part, she didn't choose flamboyant selections and
she only chose two that are generally familiar. Those were Balfe's
``I dreamt I dwelt in marble halls'' and Offenbach's ``O mon cher
amant'' from ``La Perichole.''
   Many of the songs were extravagantly melancholy, like the first,
``Sad Likeness of my Phyllis'' by Bellini, with its line ``I have
shed bitter tears over your ashes.''
   Her one encore was ``There's No Place Like Home.'' As she sang
it, Dame Joan glanced up and around the opera house. The Met isn't
``ever so humble'' but it has been one of her special homes, where
she is always happily greeted, for almost three decades.
   It's interesting that even a simple tune like ``There's No Place
like Home'' sounds like an aria when Dame Joan sings it. Several of
the other songs in the recital were combinations of folk and art
songs. They sounded, sung by this singer, like classical art songs.
   Dame Joan didn't use her first two or three songs to loosen her
vocal chords. She sounded fine from the beginning. Her ``silver
flute'' voice has become a bit darker but not much; the difference
is heard more in added warmth. Her accuracy is phenomenal. She sang
perfect trills in some of the brief coloratura passages. The two
selections on the program with the most exciting coloratura were
Ricci's 1850 ``Io non sono piu l'Annetta'' and Massenet's 1888
``Autumn Thoughts.'' We particularly enjoyed Tosti's flowingly
melodic ``La serenata'' and the six Massenet songs.
   Other composers heard were Meyerbeer, Rossini, Donizetti, David,
Bizet, Chaminade, Godard and Gounod.
   Sometimes Dame Joan's tone sounds a bit hollow and sometimes she
scoops up to notes, which isn't new. But her tone is beautiful; she
isn't shrill or harsh.
   The capacity audience jumped up to award the singer a standing
ovation.

   The annual Calle Ocho festival drew crowds estimated
at more than 1 million people to the Little Havana section Sunday
despite a gang-related shooting and controversy over a ban on
singers who performed in Cuba.
   A boy was hospitalized in stable condition following the
shooting, which involved rival youth gangs three blocks from the
edge of the festival, police said. Four juveniles were arrested and
charged with attempted murder.
   Nearly 300 people were arrested at the festival, mostly youths
charged with fighting, drinking or disorderly conduct, police said.
One officer was slightly injured when he was hit above the left eye
with a bottle.
   More than a million people flocked to the 23-block Little Havana
area _ whose main street is Eighth Street, or Calle Ocho _ for Latin
music, dancing and food, according to police and the sponsoring
Kiwanis Club.
   Amid the fun, the weeklong dispute over the ban of singers Denise
de Kalafe, Andy Montanez and De Raymond seemed almost forgotten. The
bans drew sharp criticism from many in Miami, where hard-line
opposition to any contacts with Cuba is not as widespread as in the
past.
   Some remained upset Sunday night.
   ``I would like to see Andy Montanez right here,'' said Jose
Morese of West Palm Beach. ``It's not fair.''
   Food vendor Malee Buther said the controversy may have kept some
people away.
   ``Last year was so crowded, you had to push people to walk,'' she
said. ``This year there are not so many people.''
   Kiwanis officials tried to avoid further controversy involving
Wilfredo Vargas, a Dominican merengue idol who performed for 10,000
dancing fans in Bayside downtown Saturday despite disclosures he
performed in Cuba 10 years ago.
   Kiwanis officials claimed they lacked proof Vargas played in
Cuba, even as a local radio station played excerpts from his
``Habana Jam'' album.
   Vargas declined to answer questions about the issue, discussing
only his performance of fast, Dominican ballroom dance music.
   ``It was a contagious merengue and the people vibrated with the
sound,'' he said.

   John ``No Nose'' DiFronzo is expected to be the
next chief of the crime syndicate in Chicago following the death of
reputed crime boss Joseph Ferriola, published reports said Sunday.
   Ferriola died early Saturday at Methodist Hospital in Houston,
where he was a patient of well-known heart specialist Dr. Michael
DeBakey, hospital spokeswoman Cindy Lea said.
   The reputed crime boss had undergone two heart transplants in the
last few weeks, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.
   The hospital declined to provide details about Ferriola's
treatment. The newspaper said he rejected the first heart and was
rejecting the second when his kidneys failed.
   The Chicago Tribune cited unidentified official sources as saying
DiFronzo, the owner of a West Side auto dealership, was expected to
succeed Ferriola as top boss. The Sun-Times carried a similar report.
   The Sun-Times said DiFronzo gained his nickname in 1949 when a
Chicago policeman caught him breaking into a women's apparel store
and shot off part of his nose.

   The bomb that blew up in a van being driven by
the wife of a Navy captain who mistakenly ordered the destruction of
an Iranian airliner was a non-military device, possibly homemade,
the FBI said Sunday.
   The bomb was ``an improvised exploding device, that would suggest
it was not some kind of a manufactured, military bomb,'' FBI
spokesman Gene Riehl said.
   ``A pipe bomb would fit into that generic family,'' he said,
adding that it may have been homemade.
   The bomb set fire to a van being driven Friday by Sharon Rogers,
whose husband, Capt. Will Rogers III, commander of the USS Vincennes
in the Persian Gulf, gave the go-ahead last July to shoot down an
aircraft mistakenly believed to be an Iranian fighter. The plane,
identified only from its radar blip, was actually a civilian
airliner and all 290 people on board were killed.
   Mrs. Rogers was not hurt.
   The New York Times, in its Monday editions, quoted an
unidentified federal official as saying investigators have compiled
a description of a man of Middle Eastern appearance who was seen in
the Rogerses' neighborhood in the past several months.
   The official said the man approached passersby, asking, ``Where
does the captain live?''
   Riehl refused to disclose more of what the FBI's investigation
had found and also declined to comment on an Iranian newspaper
editorial that blamed the FBI for the bombing, saying it was
engineered to provoke anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
   ``We have no response to that at all,'' he said.
   The English-language newspaper Kayhan International linked the
alleged U.S. plot to Western anger at Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
order that British novelist Salman Rushdie be killed for his new
novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The bombing ``will not be the last attempt to implicate Iran''
over the Rushdie controversy, Kayhan International said in an
editorial summarized by Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   FBI spokeswoman Kathy Kennedy in Washington denied the allegation
and added, ``We have never made any linkage to Iran since this
incident happened.''
   The special agent in charge of the FBI's San Diego office, Tom
Hughes, and Dennis Usery, regional director of the Naval
Investigative Service, met Sunday with the Rogerses. They have been
under the continuous protection of NIS agents at an undisclosed
location since shortly after the bombing.
   ``It was a `How are you feeling?' type of thing,'' said Riehl.
``I think the meeting was more to reassure them a little bit or to
help them through their trouble.''
   Usery said the security surrounding the couple would continue
indefinitely.
   ``They are in good spirits,'' Usery said, ``and they are aware of
the necessity for security.''
   The Rogerses returned home briefly Saturday afternoon, presumably
to collect belongings.
   Chief Craig Huebler, spokesman for the San Diego Naval Base, said
the Navy was awaiting FBI findings to determine if the couple would
return to work Monday. Mrs. Rogers is a teacher.
   The captain remained in command of the Vincennes, whose home port
is San Diego. As commander, Rogers would be required to stay in the
San Diego area, Huebler said Sunday.
   FBI officials also met Sunday with representatives of NIS,
Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, San Diego Police and the county
Sheriff's Department.
   ``The (agencies') management staff have been meeting all day to
evaluate what has happened and discuss theories and possibilities,
obviously none of which are going to be made public,'' said Riehl.
``I think it's safe to say this (the meetings) will happen every day
until some resolution is come to.''
   Riehl said that under Justice Department guidelines, the FBI
would not discuss any aspects of the investigative process involving
possible ``prosecutive elements.''
   Federal investigators ended their work late Saturday at the
University City intersection where the van exploded. The van was
taken away Saturday evening, but Riehl refused to say where it was
being kept.
   Thomas Hughes, agent in the charge of the San Diego FBI office,
said Saturday that the agency faced a lengthy analysis to determine
what type of bomb was used, but he said fragments indicated it could
have been a pipe bomb.
   Government sources said the possibility of terrorism was being
investigated. Officials confirmed the Rogers family received
threatening calls about the missile strike on the airliner.
   Rogers had driven the van earlier Friday for a regular run to a
nearby donut shop and felt he may have been the target of the
bombing, said Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who talked with the
captain.

   Eastern Airlines rolled out planes for renewed
service on seven Latin American routes Sunday and continued to lure
bargain hunters to its Northeast shuttle in an effort to rebuild
despite a week-old strike.
   The company ballyhooed the reopening of the routes as a new start
for the airline, which filed for bankruptcy protection last week,
blaming its pilots for honoring Machinists' picket lines and
plunging the carrier into a cash crisis.
   Service to three more South American cities, two domestic routes
and Montreal will begin later in the week, the airline said.
   ``What we're really saying is it is the start of a new, smaller,
restructured and viable Eastern Airlines,'' said Eastern spokesman
Robin Matell.
   Eastern, just nine days earlier the nation's seventh-largest
carrier with 1,040 daily flights, planned to put 75 planes into the
air Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Grease-gobbling germs that eat themselves
to death while cleaning drains are the secret weapons of a fledgling
franchise business that bills itself as an ``HMO for restaurants.''
   Bio-Care Inc., which has more than 200 clients in California, is
gearing up for a nationwide grease-busting attack with the backing
of a venture capital arm of W.R. Grace &amp; Co., the New York-based
chemical and natural resources company.
   Bud McMahon, Bio-Care's founder and chairman, has big plans for
the little bugs his company uses, which he claims are safer to
handle than harsh chemical remedies.
   ``Every sink and toilet in the country is a potential client,''
he said. ``In our conservative projections, we figure we will
service about 10 percent of the 500,000 food service outlets in 60
months, and the company at that time will have a value well over
$200 million,'' he said.
   The only way to get that many clients that fast, he said, is
through a franchise organization. ``We have to open up the flood
gates to the entrepreneur in the areas who want to do this kind of
business.''
   Bio-Care is like an HMO, or health maintenance organization,
because it offers regular maintenance at a fixed price and will
correct any problems at no additional cost, McMahon said.
   ``It seems to be working fairly well,'' said Norman Fairchild,
kitchen manager at the TGI Friday's chain restaurant in San Mateo.
``We had enough problems before that we needed a service like this.
They come out once a week for 15 or 20 minutes and spray into the
drains in the restaurants and outside. They guarantee their work, so
it seems a good deal.''
   The bugs that eat the grease are a blend of naturally occurring
bacilli and pseudomonas bacteria that have been selectively adapted
for Bio-Care by Sybron Chemicals Inc.
   Sybron, a private company based in Birmingham, N.J., is the
nation's largest supplier of specialized bacterial cultures for the
pollution control industry. The company has sales of about $120
million a year.
   No genetic engineering was involved in creating the Bio-Care
formula. Instead, the bacteria were chosen and cultivated for their
ability to work together as they break down the types of foods that
usually clog drains.
   Several kinds of the bacteria were developed and patented more
than a decade ago. Others were mixed in to suit Bio-Care's focus on
cleaning up the gunk most often found in restaurant kitchen drains.
It took nearly three years to come up with a formula, test it,
refine it and produce a final product.
   The bacteria break down animal fats and food products, liquifying
and digesting them and turning them into carbon dioxide, water and
bacterial cells, the same way waste is normally disposed of in
nature. The Bio-Care bacteria keep eating and multiplying until
their food source is gone. Then they die off.
   ``They grow very rapidly as long as there's a lot of food around,
and can double as fast as every 20 minutes,'' said Mike Krupka,
marketing manager for Sybron's biochemical division. ``But then the
beauty of it is, once whatever is clogging the drain goes away or is
totally consumed, the bacteria run out of food and die off. They eat
themselves to death.''
   About 5 billion bacteria are in each gram in the teabag-like
``Bio-Sock'' packets used by Bio-Care to eliminate grease trap
overflow and reduce toxic odors associated with hydrogen sulfide
accumulation.
   ``These are all certified non-pathogenic bacteria, meaning they
don't cause disease,'' Krupka said. ``They are not used primarily to
get rid of clogs but rather for preventive maintenance. It keeps the
grease from accumulating in the pipes and it's not harsh or
dangerous to handle the way strong chemicals can be.''
   Clogged drains are more quickly cleared through a mechanical
process. Then the bacteria are used regularly to keep them clear, he
said.
   By April 1, Bio-Care plans to have franchise applications filed
in all 50 states. By the end of the year it expects to have 15
franchises in operation.
   ``We're going to grow it very slow so everybody has the
opportunity to never make mistakes; we're trying to make all the
mistakes now,'' McMahon said.

<HEAD>Channel One Plans Live Broadcast Of Space Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Channel One, the new television service that is
beaming daily news shows with commercials into six schools, plans to
produce its first live broadcast Monday with coverage of the space
shuttle launch.
   The special broadcast, which will contain no commercials, will be
sent to the six schools participating in a test of the new service
for use at their discretion, the program's creators said Friday.
   Channel One is produced by Whittle Communications LP, a
Knoxville, Tenn.-based media concern that has given about $50,000
worth of televisions, video equipment and satellite dishes to each
of the six test schools to receive its daily 12-minute news show.
Each show contains up to two minutes of paid ads.
   Some educators have denounced the project, which debuted March 6,
for permitting advertisers to intrude into the classroom.
   The space launch coverage will be separate from the daily news
show. It will feature live video supplied by NASA via satellite
along with commentary from the Los Angeles studio by the regular
Channel One news anchors and a space travel expert.
   The Discovery launch is tentatively scheduled for Monday morning.
   William S. Rukeyser, editor-in-chief of Whittle Communications,
said the plans for a live broadcast provide ``an exciting example of
what Channel One can do.''
   The six schools involved in the test are Eisenhower Middle School
in Kansas City, Kan.; Withrow High School in Cincinnati; Mumford
High School in Detroit; Central High School in Knoxville, Tenn.;
Billerica Memorial High School in Billerica, Mass.; and Gahr High
School in Cerritos, Calif.

<TEXT>
   The jury in the GAF Corp. stock manipulation
trial asked Sunday to review all charts, graphs and closing
arguments in its second day of deliberations in the Wall Street
fraud case.
   The panel is deciding whether GAF and its vice chairman, James T.
Sherwin, tried to illegally boost the share price of Union Carbide
Corp. in 1986 prior to the sale of a large block of the stock.
   The case is the first to reach the trial phase in a series of
prosecutions by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office emanating from
Wall Street's insider trading scandals.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin were indicted last July on
charges of stock manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud and
conspiracy. The company faces up to $12 million in fines while
Sherwin could be sentenced to up to 40 years in jail and fined $2
million.
   After a six-week re-trial, the jury received the case from U.S.
District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe and began deliberating Saturday,
when it re-heard testimony by the government's star witness, Los
Angeles broker Boyd L. Jefferies.
   The jury's request Sunday was viewed as a sign that it was not
pinning its decision on the credibility of Jefferies' testimony.
Jefferies said Sherwin asked him to raise Union Carbide stock to $22
a share or higher in October 1986.
   GAF sold 5 million shares of the stock in mid-November 1986. The
Wayne, N.J.-based chemicals manufacturer failed earlier that year in
a takeover bid for Carbide.
   Jefferies testified as part of a plea bargain with the government
after agreeing to plead guilty to two criminal securities law
violations in connection with his dealings with jailed arbitrager
Ivan Boesky.
   Jefferies is expected to testify in two key securities fraud
cases later this year.

<HEAD>New Health Study Set For Boeing Plant</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. officials and the union representing
Boeing production workers have authorized a new study of work
conditions at the company's Auburn plant, where dozens of employees
say they've fallen ill from working with chemicals.
   Company and union officials on Friday confirmed the new study.
   Last year, dozens of Auburn plant employees who worked with
phenolic resins complained of illnesses ranging from headaches and
nausea to memory loss. Twenty workers filed insurance claims.
   The illnesses were the subject of congressional hearings two
weeks ago in Washington, D.C.
   State and federal inspectors found the plant to be in compliance
with safety standards, but Boeing still halted use of the resins,
used to make plastic parts for aircraft interiors.
   ``We're not convinced nor do we know that's the only problem,''
said Tom Baker, president of District 751 of the International
Association of Machinists &amp; Aerospace workers, which represents
40,000 Boeing workers.
   Baker said questions still linger about whether low-level
exposure to the resins might cause health problems, even if chemical
levels in the air are within government limits.
   A committee of six company and union executives decided to
proceed with the new study recommended by occupational health
experts from the University of Washington and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology.
   Dr. Alan Ducatman, director of environmental medical services at
MIT, said he recommended an extensive study because nothing less
would properly test some theories as to why the workers were getting
sick. He declined to outline those theories.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder declined to discuss details of the
study, saying they have not been settled.

<HEAD>Futures Industry Leaders To Meet Under Cloud Of Federal Probe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of the futures industry will meet this
week in Boca Raton, Fla., the traditional sunny setting for their
annual gathering. But it will be clouded this year by a federal
investigation of trading fraud at the world's two largest futures
exchanges.
   Nearly two months have elapsed since the FBI ``sting'' operation
at the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
was disclosed. No indictments have been issued and the story has
been replaced on the financial pages by fresher controversies.
   Yet the scandal remains a major concern among the 1,100 brokerage
executives, money managers and exchange officers registered for the
Futures Industry Association's meeting, and talk of it is likely to
surface frequently in both private conversations and public
discussions during the three-day affair.
   ``People are calling me every day and asking `What's going on
with this thing?''' said John Damgard, president of the
Washington-based trade group. ``Hardly a day goes by that we don't
talk about what effect the investigation and the allegations are
going to have on the program.''
   But only the Justice Department knows for sure where the probe is
headed, and it's not talking.
   What is known is that hundreds of grand-jury subpoenas have been
issued, many of them to futures traders who have been questioned
about the opportunities for cheating customers while executing their
orders in the boisterous futures pits.
   Damgard said the government's investigation did not play a major
role in shaping the FIA meeting program. But neither has the
association shied away from scheduling sessions in which
probe-related issues are bound to arise.
   Thursday's conference-opening panel discussion on self-regulation
and trading practices may further illuminate the Chicago exchanges'
responses to the criticism that has buffeted the industry since the
investigation was revealed. Board of Trade Chairman Karsten ``Cash''
Mahlmann and Chicago Merc President William Brodsky will be among
the panelists.
   ``I think you will find the possibility that a guy like Cash
Mahlmann might discuss some of the changes the Board of Trade has
announced,'' said Robert Wilmouth, who will moderate the session and
who is himself president of the National Futures Association, a
congressionally mandated self-regulatory organization.
   The Board of Trade is planning a $1 million upgrade of its
computerized trade-surveillance system, which federal regulators
recently criticized as inadequate for detecting abuses, and both
Chicago exchanges are reviewing their trading rules.
   Futures are contracts to buy or sell a commodity or financial
instrument for a specified price at a future date.
   The FIA meeting also will include a speech Thursday by Wendy
Gramm, chairman of the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
which regulates futures trading. And it will give many in the
industry their first look at the Chicago Board of Trade's planned
off-hours electronic trading system.
   The investigation in Chicago is hastening the move toward
electronic trading, which will permit around-the-clock trading of
futures contracts and, some contend, provide a better audit trail
than traditional open-outcry trading.
   The Board of Trade revealed last month that it was working on an
electronic trading system to compete with Globex, a similar system
being developed by the Chicago Merc and London-based Reuters
Holdings PLC.

<HEAD>Illinois Central Agrees To Be Bought By New York Conglomerate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois Central Transportation Co., the owner of
the Illinois Central Railroad, has accepted a $436 million takover
bid from the Prospect Group, creator of a successful railroad in
Mississippi three years ago, the companies announced.
   The announcement came six weeks after the New York-based
conglomerate launched the unsolicited $20-a-share cash takeover
offer for the Illinois Central, a major carrier of freight between
Chicago and the Gulf of Mexico. The railroad originally gave a
neutral reaction to Prospect's bid.
   Prospect and Illinois Central said in a joint statement Friday
that the railroad had accepted the bid.
   Illinois Central, which has 21.8 million shares outstanding, is a
spinoff of the Chicago-based Whitman Corp. that began trading as an
independent company Jan. 3 at $11 a share.
   The railroad formerly was called the Illinois Central Gulf.
Whitman is the name adopted last year by the former IC Industries.
   ``The (Illinois Central) board has unanimously determined that
the Prospect offer and the merger ... are fair to, and in the best
interests of, the shareholders of Illinois Central,'' said Harry J.
Bruce, chairman and chief executive officer of the railroad company.
   Illinois Central's financial adviser, Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets Inc., found the offer to be fair to shareholders, the
statement said.
   W. Wallace McDowell Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of
Prospect, said the company looks forward to ``continuing the long
and fine traditions of the Illinois Central and working with the
company's many excellent employees and customers.''
   The Prospect Group owns MidSouth Corp., a regional railroad based
in Jackson, Miss., that has enjoyed great success since Prospect
created it three years ago, partly with the purchase of Illinois
Central track.
   ``It was one of these dream stories,'' Prospect spokesman Don
Dwight said Friday in a telephone interview from New York. ``It was
profitable in its first year (1987), with revenues of $55 million
and net earnings of $5 million, and it did much better in 1988, with
$80 million in revenues and $8.7 million in earnings.
   ``That was Prospect's introduction into railroads, and it
eventually led to the interest in acquiring Illinois Central,'' he
said.
   Illinois Central stock closed at $19.75 a share Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange, down 87{ cents. Prospect shares closed
unchanged at $9.12{ in over-the-counter trading.
   In addition to MidSouth, Prospect owns or is affiliated with such
diverse businesses as the Forschner Group Inc., the U.S. marketer of
Swiss army knives, based in Shelton, Conn.; several insurance
companies; and the Dallas-based National Spirit Group, which runs
cheerleader camps and owns the company that manufactures cheerleader
uniforms.
   Prospect recently sold Murray Bakery Products Inc., based in
Augusta, Ga., the largest supplier of cookies to the Girl Scouts of
America.

<HEAD>Boeing Says Commercial Jet Market Worth $516 Billion Through 2005</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes has increased its
estimate of the commercial jetliner market for the next 16 years,
saying it expects 8,417 aircraft worth a total $516 billion will be
delivered by the end of 2005.
   The new forecast is in Boeing's just-released Current Market
Outlook, which it publishes each year. The report applies to the
commercial jet industry as a whole and is not limited to Boeing
aircraft.
   The dollar value is 24.6 percent above last year's estimate of
$414 billion, while the estimated number of aircraft has grown by
1,509 from the 6,908 forecast in the 1988 report.
   Jack Howard, Boeing Commercial Airplanes director of market
research, said the revised estimates are based on prolonged air
travel growth fueled by continued growth in discretionary income and
the decrease in the real cost of travel after allowing for
inflation. The report predicts relatively stable fuel prices and no
recession for the foreseeable future.
   About 70 percent of the new planes will be needed for growth in
traffic, the report said, with the rest to replace aircraft going
out of service.
   While some industry analysts believe replacement sales will
accelerate because of concerns over aging aircraft, Howard said that
maintaining current fleets might be less expensive for airlines.
Replacement with new jets could drive up operating costs and
therefore the cost to the public, which could slow air travel
growth, he said.
   Boeing estimates that on average, airlines replace jets after 28
years, while others use a 25-year estimate. Howard said Boeing had
predicted that 250 to 300 planes would be retired in 1988, but in
fact only 60 were.
   ``The current fleets are very reliable,'' Howard said. ``Airlines
and air traveler confidence in the safety of these airplanes has not
been lost.''
   Still, Howard's report indicates that replacements through 2005
will be 20 percent higher in dollar value than last year's estimate.
   The report estimates stronger demand for airplanes in the 170-to
240-seat category, with the larger aircraft taking over domestic
routes that have outgrown medium-sized airplanes in domestic
service. It also predicts a strong increase in short- to
medium-range jets of more than 350 seats and a modest increase in
demand for large, long-range aircraft.

<HEAD>Dollar Strengthens, Stock Prices Lower In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar strengthened against the Japanese
yen Monday, while stock prices declined slightly.
   The dollar opened at 129.38 yen, up 0.50 yen from Friday's close
of 128.88 yen.
   Dealers said the U.S. currency's strength followed a similar
trend in New York on Friday, when the U.S. Labor Department reported
a continuing strong growth in domestic employment.
   However, the report that the U.S. unemployment rate fell to a
15-year low of 5.1 percent in February, from 5.4 percent the
previous month, created concerns that the U.S. central bank may
raise interest rates to cool down the economy in an ever-tightening
labor market.
   Higher interest rates tend to make the dollar more attractive to
foreign investors.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, a 45.33-point gainer Friday, shed 48.54 points or
0.15 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 31,653.24.

<HEAD>Study: Black Women Outpacing White Women In Drive For Equal Wages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Educational and career advances by black
women, combined with a lull in the earning power of black men, have
narrowed the salary gap between the two, a University of Michigan
researcher says.
   By contrast, white women are lagging in their attempt to close
the wage gap with their male counterparts, said Reynolds Farley, a
research associate with the school's Population Studies Center.
   ``This improvement in the earnings of black women compared with
those of black men is the result of greater educational attainment,
more occupational opportunities for black women and a virtual
stagnation of the earnings of black men in the last 15 years,''
Farley said last week.
   In 1986, he said, black women ages 25 to 54 earned an average of
$12,100 a year, or about 75 percent of the average black male's
yearly salary of $16,000. White women in the same age bracket
averaged $12,800, roughly half the average white male's annual pay.
   ``Compared with the incomes of most black men, the average black
woman's income has risen sharply since World War II,'' Farley said,
noting that in 1947, black women earned only 34 percent of a black
man's average salary.
   Farley conducted the study with Suzanne M. Bianchi, a demographer
at the U.S. Bureau of the Census' Center for Demographic Studies.

<HEAD>Pittston, Mine Union Agree To Public Debate In Labor Dispute</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Top officials of The Pittson Co. and the
United Mine Workers have agreed to publicly debate issues in a
contract dispute that has left coal miners in three Appalachian
states without a contract for more than a year.
   The Greenwich Fellowship of Clergy suggested the rare public
forum after a demonstration by coal miners outside Pittston
headquarters in Greenwich last month, and invited Pittston Chairman
Paul W. Douglas and Mine Workers President Richard Trumka to
participate.
   In separate letters Friday to the Rev. C. Edward Deyton, pastor
of Diamond Hill United Methodist Church in Greenwich and fellowship
chairman, Trumka accepted the offer and Douglas designated Gene
Matthis, chairman of the Pittston Coal Group in Lebanon, Va., as the
company's representative at the debate.
   No date has been set for the forum in Greenwich. Both Douglas and
Trumka said they hope it can be scheduled soon.
   In their original letters to Douglas and Trumka, the clergy
expressed hope that ``an evening of discussion ... would help bring
about a healthy reconciliation.''
   Members of the United Mine Workers have been working for more
than a year without a contract in Virginia, Kentucky and West
Virginia.
   Pittson, a diversified company that also is involved in air
freight and security systems, employs about 1,700 people in 20
mines. It has laid off about 4,000 miners in recent years due to
technological advances and the closing of mines.
   Miners threatened to strike Feb. 1, one year after agreeing to
work without a contract while negotiations continued, but accepted a
30- to 60-day cooling off period requested by the governors of the
three states.
   Pittston spokesman William J. Byrne Jr. was skeptical at first
about the forum, saying last week, ``I certainly have a hard time
understanding how Greenwich can be helpful in Appalachia.''
   Greenwich is one of Connecticut's most affluent communities,
located near New York City.
   Trumka said in his statement that the clergy had ``earned out
respect and appreciation'' for sponsoring the forum.
