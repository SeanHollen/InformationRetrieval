<HEAD>US Citizen And Belize Citizen Arrested After Emergency Plane Landing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. citizen and a Belize citizen
were being held after their small plane made an emergency landing
on the Caribbean coast, the Foreign Ministry said Wednesday.
   A ministry statement identified the American as Arthur Burton,
37, and the Belize citizen as Abimael Castillo Canur, 38. No
hometowns were given.
   The men were taken into custody after their Aerocommander plane
suffered a gas leak when it made an emergency landing Saturday at
Puerto Cabezas in Zelaya Norte province, 186 miles northeast of
Managua.
   ``Given the irregularity and strangeness of the case, Nicaraguan
authorities have decided to retain the crew members of the plane,''
the Foreign Ministry statement said.
   The two will remain in custody ``until we clarify their
identity, the ownership and nationality of the plan and the reasons
they were traveling without any documents,'' the statement said.
   It said neither man nor the plane carried documents and that a
flight plan had not been filed.
   A U.S. Embassy source in Managua, speaking on condition of
anonymity, would only say that a U.S. consular official had visited
Burton.
   The statement by the Nicaraguan government did not say where the
men were being held.
   The Foreign Ministry said the U.S. and Belize governments had
been notified of the case and asked for their cooperation in
clearing up the affair.

<HEAD>Government Joins Suit Alleging Fraud by Pentagon Contractor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government has joined a ``whistleblower''
lawsuit that accuses Litton Industries Inc. of overcharging the
Pentagon $25 million for computer work, according to court
documents unsealed Wednesday.
   The Justice Department decision to intervene in the suit by a
former Litton employee suggests government investigators believe
the allegations may have merit.
   Mary McMenimen, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in
Los Angeles, declined to comment on the action.
   The suit, filed last April by former Litton manager James
Carton, alleges that the company in effect charged the government
for work it did for commercial customers using the same computer
system.
   Litton spokesman John Thom denied wrongdoing by the Beverly
Hills-based company, which makes electronic navigation and control
gear for a variety of military planes and missiles.
   The suit alleges the company programmed computers to
under-record the amount of commercial work while properly recording
the volume of government work at the Litton computer services
division in the Los Angeles suburb of Woodland Hills.
   Overcharges on dozens of computer design and engineering
contracts from 1981 through 1987 amounted to at least $25 million,
alleged Carton's attorney, John R. Phillips.
   The action was brought under the False Claims Act, which
entitles those who report fraud against the government to get up to
25 percent of any damages awarded.
   Carton decided to file suit only after complaints to company
officials and a Pentagon fraud hotline failed to bring action,
Phillips said.
   ``He told everybody within the division ... and they didn't do
anything,'' the lawyer said. ``He talked to somebody at the hotline
in general terms but he was not persuaded or convinced that they
were really going to make a serious effort to do something about
this.''
   Thom refused to comment in detail on the allegations, but
maintained that joint government-civilian use of the computer
system saved the Pentagon money. That is because civilian work
could be scheduled during slack times in the government contracts
and help defray operating cost of the system, he said.
   ``We're going to fight it,'' Thom said. ``We think the charges
have no merit whatsoever.''
   The lawsuit doesn't specify which military systems might be
involved in the alleged overcharges.
   It doesn't name company officials responsible for the alleged
overcharging, but Phillips said Carton believed knowledge went at
least as high as top-division management.
   Carton, who was technical director at the division from 1984 to
1987, discovered the alleged cost-shifting while conducting a
profitability study on the company's 30 commercial accounts,
Phillips said. Commercial customers included businesses as diverse
as Kaiser Steel and Flynt Publications, publisher of hard-porn
Hustler magazine.
   Carton, 46, left Litton on friendly terms during a
reorganization of the division's management in early 1987 and now
works for another defense contractor, Northrop Corp., the attorney
said.
   In addition to its electronics work, Litton builds Navy ships at
its Ingalls shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss.

   Democrat Jill Long scored a surprise
victory over Republican Dan Heath Tuesday night in a special
election for the House seat that launched the political career of
Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Long received 65,160 votes, or 51 percent, to 63,388, or 49
percent, for Heath.
   She will be the first Democrat to represent northeast Indiana's
4th Congressional District since Quayle won the 1976 congressional
election and the 26th woman in the 435-seat House of
Representatives.
   It was the third try for a Washington political office by Long,
who lost a bid for the seat last November by a margin of nearly
50,000 votes and lost the 1986 Senate election to Quayle.
   ``I knew it was going to be a close race,'' Long said in her
victory speech. ``I believed we were going to win. The surprise
would have been if there had been a large margin of victory.
   ``I am committed to doing what I believe is right for northeast
Indiana and my country. I have long believed that Hoosiers are
independent, and when we put forth god candidates on either side,
we win,'' Long added.
   In his concession speech, Heath said, ``It's a hard pill to
swallow but I am a man and a good man and I did my best.''
   Heath claimed his record and credentials as a candidate had been
distorted in the campaign by negative advertising. ``I apologize to
no one and to no voter,'' he said. ``Winning this race was a quest
but not an obsession.''
   The polls closed at 6 p.m. EST, one hour after Heath and Long
ended a final day of campaigning at restaurants and plant gates
   Thundershowers, which had been predicted for the afternoon and
which Democrats had feared would reduce turnout among blue-collar
voters casting ballots after factory shift changes, failed to
materialize.
   With voting predicted to dip as low as 30 percent among more
than 200,000 registered voters, turnout efforts were more important
than usual, said party workers on both sides.
   Heath and Long renewed their campaigns before sunrise, each
opening election day with a coffee shop stop here.
   An independent poll taken in the week before the election showed
Heath with 44 percent and Long with 36 percent, with 20 percent
still undecided.
   The 4th District seat was vacated in January by Republican
incumbent Dan Coats, who resigned to take the Senate seat Quayle
occupied before becoming vice president.
   In 1976, district voters were the first to send Quayle to
Washington as a 28-year-old congressman. Quayle won re-election in
1978, then gave up the seat in a successful effort to defeat
three-term Democratic senator Birch Bayh.
   Quayle and First Lady Barbara Bush campaigned earlier for the
Republican candidate and former Democratic presidential hopeful
Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee campaigned for the Democrat.
   County election administrators decided to use paper ballots
rather than voting machines or computer ballots to cut costs in an
election that no one had budgeted. Allen County officials estimated
paper ballots would save $20,000.

   Peace activists hauled trees onto a
new rail spur used to transport U.S. Army tanks, officials said,
and police reportedly used truncheons to disperse protesters who
had blocked a nearby road.
   A U.S. official said Tuesday's protests did not disrupt the
transport of tanks along the rail spur near Bremen en route to
maneuvers.
   ``It's been pretty much business as usual here,'' said Capt.
Keith F. Jordan, spokesman for the Army's 2nd Armored Division
Forward unit in nearby Garlstedt.
   But activists, who asked not to be identified, said that at one
point West German police used truncheons to break up a group of
demonstrators blocking a road near the rail spur and that one
protester was slightly injured.
   A police official, who also asked not to be identified, said
late Tuesday that he had no information about the reported incident.
   Jordan said protesters placed small trees on the 5.2 mile rail
link during the night but the debris was easily removed.

<HEAD>Savannah River Plant Managers Say They Recommend Putting Off Safety
Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Managers of the Energy Department's nuclear
weapons complex near here said Tuesday they have recommended
putting off a series of safety tests until after one of its three
idle reactors is restarted.
   James Moore, president of Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which
takes over as operator of the government-owned complex Saturday,
said ultrasonic testing for cracks in the reactor vessel and piping
would be ``just an added burden'' that would not enhance safety.
   ``The concept of doing the ultrasonic is really to get a good
idea of the actual situation in the vessel to determine the
long-term capabilities of the vessel,'' he said. ``It's not a
near-term safety problem at all.''
   Then-Energy Secretary John Herrington said last year that he
would require ultrasonic testing of the plant's K reactor before it
could be restarted.
   All three active reactors at the plant have been shut down for
safety reasons since last April. They are the nation's only source
of tritium, a highly perishable gas needed to manufacture U.S.
nuclear weapons.
   The Pentagon has said that at least one of the reactors must be
restarted by the end of this year to avert a serious shortage in
tritium supplies.
   Moore, in an interview with The Associated Press in his
temporary office a few miles from the reactor complex, said
Westinghouse remained committed to carrying out the ultrasonic
testing.
   ``To put in an ultrasonic testing program...would really be
counterproductive in terms of all the other things going on,'' he
said.
   Energy Department officials at the weapons plant are reviewing
Westinghouse's recommendation to put off the testing. The
recommendation is part of a broad new plan that Westinghouse
presented to the department last week as a proposed blueprint for
restarting the K reactor, Moore said.
   Moore declined to reveal other details of the restart strategy,
which he said he would be discussing with Energy Secretary James
Watkins over the next few weeks.
   Watkins has instructed Westinghouse to give top priority to
getting the K reactor running again, but has stressed that
operations would not resume until safety could be assured. He has
not commented directly on the question of whether ultrasonic
testing is needed first.
   The company that has managed the Savannah River Plant since its
construction in the 1950s, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., has used
conventional tests with colored dyes to search for cracking in
reactor vessels and piping, and had said earlier this year that it
planned to start ultrasonic testing this summer.
   A leak from a crack in the vessel of another reactor at Savannah
River, the the C reactor, was discovered in 1984. That led to its
permanent shutdown a year later.

   Striking government workers used
slingshots to hurl fishing weights at police and were repelled with
tear-gas grenades in the latest battle over union demands for a
cost-of-living bonus.
   French Premier Michel Rocard offered to reopen negotiations in
Paris on a bonus to cover high costs on the Mediterranean island,
but several unions said the talks should take place in Corsica.
   The 400 to 500 demonstrators, some of them masked, hurled stones
and fishing weights Tuesday at the prefecture building in the
northern port of Bastia. They were charged by riot squads but
regrouped and attacked throughout the day, witnesses said.
   The workers are demanding a bonus to offset the high cost of
living on Corsica, estimated at 4.2 percent more expensive than the
French mainland.
   At least one demonstrator and three policemen were injured in
the clashes, Corsican officials said.
   Union leaders met with government officials on Saturday, but
talks broke down after just two hours. Rocard designated the
Cabinet minister in charge of the civil service, Michel
   Tuesday's violence was the latest in six weeks of intermittant
strikes and blockades or ports and airports which cut the
Mediteranean island off from the mainland.
   The blockades were lifted for four days but a cargo boat was
prevented from leaving the southern port of Ajaccio on Tuesday, the
French news agency Agence France-Presse reported.

<HEAD>Politicians Get 520 Pages of Speech Fodder in New Book of Quotes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians stumped for memorable quotations
to enliven their speeches need look no further than ``Respectfully
Quoted,'' a newly published book from the Library of Congress that
is crammed with 2,100 oratorical gems from the past.
   The book might give some comfort to Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
whose 1988 presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a
controversy over cribbed comments.
   If Biden recalls a famous line from President Kennedy's
inaugural address in 1961, he might be intrigued that Lebanese
writer Kahlil Gibran asked much earlier, ``Are you a politician
asking what your country can do for you, or a zealous one asking
what you can do for your country?''
   The book, a three-year project by Suzy Platt of the library's
congressional reference division, is a compilation of quotations
which members of Congress or their staffs over the past 75 years
have asked the library to verify for their exact wording and
origins.
   For the hapless politician scrambling to extricate himself from
trouble, there's this reputed quote from former Republican
presidential candidate George Romney: ``I didn't say that I didn't
say it. I said that I didn't say that I said it. I want to make
that very clear.''
   It was Theodore Roosevelt who cast this verbal harpoon at
President John Tyler: ``He has been called a mediocre man, but this
is unwarranted flattery. He was a politician of monumental
littleness.''
   Exasperation prompted former Rep. George E. Danielson, D-Calif.,
to declare that trying to get answers from Attorney General John N.
Mitchell during House hearings on the Watergate scandal in 1974 was
``like trying to nail a drop of water to the wall.''
   ``These quotations come from the real world of cut-and-thrust
politics,'' says Charles A. Goodrum, former assistant director of
the library's Congressional Research Service, which compiled the
520-page dictionary of political quotes. ``They show the
combination of spirit and humor that represents American political
activity at its best.''
   Ms. Platt amassed verified quotations which researchers began
recording on 3-by-5 cards nearly 50 years ago to avoid
time-consuming duplication of efforts. The CRS handles more than
1,500 requests for information from Congress every day.
   The researchers discovered that some widely used quotes, now
part of American folklore, are impossible to trace to the person
who first uttered them. Other quotes have been mistakenly
attributed to a few legendary orators, such as Abraham Lincoln.
   It has never been verified, they say, that Lincoln _ or P.T.
Barnum _ observed that ``you may fool all the people some of the
time; you can even fool some of the people all the time, but you
can't fool all of the people all the time.''
   Who said, ``Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing?'' The
library says it wasn't the late Vince Lombardi but Red Sanders,
football coach at Vanderbilt University.
   Goodrum said Congress no longer produces thundering, long-winded
orators of the likes of Daniel Webster, Henry Clay or John C.
Calhoun, and that television's insatiable hunger for 20-second
``sound bites'' is largely to blame.
   ``Today's politicians probably aren't as quotable as the
old-time orators who spoke in the measured cadences of the Bible
and Shakespeare,'' he said. ``Even though their quotes don't stand
up so they can be chiseled on marble as clearly, their speeches
reflect some very incisive thinking about the major issues of our
time.''

<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old man who faced execution
by lethal injection Friday for murdering a Las Vegas store clerk
during a 1986 robbery won a stay Tuesday from a federal judge.
   David Pellegrini had initially not wanted a stay but changed his
mind Monday. Assistant Federal Public Defender Pat Flanagan
immediately obtained the stay from U.S. District Judge Phil Pro of
Las Vegas.
   Pro told Pellegrini he should return to the state courts and
file any post-conviction appeals possible at that level before
filing any more federal court petitions.
   Pellegrini was sentenced to die for the slaying of Barry
Hancock, 27, who was handcuffed and shot in the head.
   Flanagan sought a stay on grounds a prosecutor improperly
suggested during a penalty hearing that there could be more victims
if Pellegrini ever got out of prison.
   The defender also claimed authorities conducted an illegal
search of Pellegrini's apartment, where the murder weapon, bullets
and blood-spattered clothes were found.
   The same issues were raised in a state Supreme Court appeal,
which was rejected last November when the high court held that the
record provided substantial support for the verdict and the penalty.

<HEAD>Baker Sees Hostile Relations Until Cuba Changes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker rejects
speculation that U.S.-Cuban relations are about to improve, saying
American policy will not change until Cuba ends repression at home
and ``unacceptable behavior'' abroad.
   Baker's views are outlined in a confidential memo drawn up to
counter suggestions that Cuba's pledge in December to withdraw its
troops from Angola will improve the climate between Havana and
Washington.
   ``U.S. policy has not changed in the wake of the southern Africa
accords,'' Baker said in the memo.
   The memo has been distributed to diplomatic posts abroad and to
selected government agencies. The document is dated March 1989 and
is stamped ``confidential.'' A copy was made available to The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
   The memo indicates that no changes are planned from the
hard-line Cuba policy of the Reagan administration. Under President
Reagan, the United States tightened the U.S. trade embargo against
the island and waged an international campaign against alleged
human rights abuses by the regime of Fidel Castro.
   ``No modification of U.S. policy is contemplated in the absence
of significant changes in Cuban repression at home and unacceptable
behavior abroad inimical to U.S. interests,'' Baker said.
   Baker rejected the arguments of some, including Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., that U.S.
policy toward Cuba over three decades has failed and should be
changed.
   ``Cuba provides the U.S.S.R. major political, strategic and
intelligence benefits that it otherwise would not have,'' Baker
said.
   ``Cuba continues to engage in military adventurism abroad and to
support subversive movements in the Western Hemisphere to the
detriment of peace, stability and democratic processes.
   ``Further, the Cuban government persists in its internal
repression and violation of the basic human rights of its citizens.
Cuba has not changed its basic policies.''
   Baker said Cuba is involved in a public diplomatic effort to
reinforce the impression that there will be an improvement in
relations with the United States. He said an end to the trade
embargo, imposed by the United States in 1960, ``would benefit
greatly the failed Cuban economy and enhance Cuba's image and
prestige.''
   It also would undercut U.S. efforts to encourage other countries
to maintain economic and political distance from Cuba, he said.
   Baker said Cuba ``has steadfastly failed to offer any concrete
proposals of its own to satisfy longstanding and well-known U.S.
concerns.''
   As described by U.S. officials, Cuba has demonstrated a more
accommodating attitude toward the United States over the last 18
months, and there has been an improvement in the ability of the two
countries to work out differences on non-strategic issues, such as
immigration.
   Cuban officials have disclosed that the head of the Cuban
Interests Section in Washington, Ramon Sanchez Parodi, will be
replaced shortly by Jose Antonio Arbesu, a vice chief of Cuba's
America Department, a party organism that oversees Cuba's relations
with other nations in the Western Hemisphere.
   Former Assistant Secretary of State Elliott Abrams said Monday
that the Cuban shift indicates a willingness to intensify
discussions with the United States on issues that have divided the
two countries.
   He noted that Arbesu had been instrumental in the negotiations
leading to the agreement on Angola.
   But two current State Department officials, both insisting on
anonymity, said they did not see Arbesu's appointment as a
political signal.
   Sanchez Parodi has been in Washington since September 1977 and
is one of the longest serving heads of diplomatic missions in
Washington.
   Baker said Cuba continues to support ``radical political
movements and violent subversive groups'' in Latin America.
   ``Cuba provides a wide range of support for the FMLN insurgent
armies in El Salvador and guerrilla groups in Guatemala,'' the
secretary said.
   ``Cuba has close relations with and provides extensive military
and economic assistance to the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua
which, in turn, provides material support to guerrillas throughout
Central America.''
   Baker added that Cuba has exploited American differences with
Panama's government by using the dispute to promote Latin American
solidarity against the United States.
   In South America, Baker said, Cuba has been supporting
subversion in Chile and Colombia and to a lesser extent rebel
groups in Peru and Ecuador.

   The Soviet Union says U.S. refusal to stop
arming rebels in Afghanistan could lead to a wider conflict in
Southwest Asia.
   Two Soviet diplomats, at a news conference Tuesday, urged
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to reconsider a Soviet
proposal for a mutual arms embargo.
   ``So far, the American side is reluctant to accept our
proposal,'' Oleg Derkovsky, a counselor at the Soviet embassy here,
said.
   He said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is likely
to renew the appeal when Baker goes to Moscow in May.
   Derkovsky said fighting between the rebels and the Afghan
government is escalating and could involve India and Iran, as the
two countries seek to protect their interests.
   The Soviet diplomat said the two countries were concerned that
Pakistan might try to arrange a federation with Afghanistan should
the rebels succeed in overthrowing President Najibullah's
government.
   ``People have to be very careful of avoiding incidents that
could lead to a larger conflict,'' Yevgeny Kutovoy,
minister-counselor of the embassy, said.
   The two diplomats accused the United States and Pakistan of
illegally arming the rebels and said the United Nations should
conduct an inquiry and consider posting monitors at the country's
borders.
   The diplomats also recalled predictions that Najibullah would
collapse ``like a house of cards'' after the Feb. 15 departure of
Soviet troops.
   The Soviet-backed Afghan leader and his army ``have shown most
convincingly they are prepared to uphold on their own the country's
sovereignty,'' Kutovoy said.
   Soviet troops backed the government in Kabul against the
U.S.-armed rebels for nine years. The war has continued since their
departure.
   Kutovoy accused Pakistan of training and arming rebel forces in
``extensive subversive and terrorist activities'' to overthrow
Najibullah's government. He said Pakistani officers were directing
attacks and that Pakistani servicemen have been captured deep
inside Afghanistan.
   Pakistan's involvement calls for a special investigation by the
United Nations and U.N. monitoring of the Geneva accords of last
April which barred outside intervention in the Afghan war, Kutovoy
said.
   At the same time, Kutovoy and Derkovsky criticized the Bush
administration for its decision to maintain U.S. arms shipments to
the rebels through Pakistan.
   The U.S. military aid ``is contradictory to the Geneva accords,
and does not help the peaceful solution of the situation in
Afghanistan,'' Kutovoy said. ``The continuation of the shipments to
the parties in Afghanistan is a source of the continuation of the
fratricidal conflict in that country.''
   Derkovsky, meanwhile, said the Soviets are no longer arming
Najibullah's government and that the weapons left behind with the
departure of Soviet troops are not outlawed by the Geneva accords.
   But, he said, ``any supply of weapons to the opposition forces
in Afghanistan through the territory of Pakistan is a clear-cut,
flagrant violation'' of the accords.
   ``Any weapon coming to Afghanistan through Pakistan is a
violation,'' Derkovsky said. ``If it comes from heaven, it's OK. If
it comes through the territory of Pakistan, no way, it's a
violation.''
   Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, said she
had no comment on the Soviet allegations or on whether the United
Nations should conduct an inquiry.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ignoring a new moderation in
neighboring Poland and Hungary, this country's Communist government
has silenced or muted voices critical of its rule.
   To a flurry of publicity in the West and protest even from the
East bloc, playwright Vaclav Havel was arrested Jan. 16 and
subsequently sentenced to eight months in jail.
   At least seven leading activists who are less known abroad but
important in the emerging, younger dissident groups at home have
also been jailed.
   Dozens of other critical voices have been muted by what
dissidents term not only the most sweeping crackdown in a decade
but a skillful, carefully targeted repression.
   Last year, it appeared to other activists that the authorities
had at last loosened up on Charter 77, Eastern Europe's oldest
human rights movement, and were prepared to tolerate a measure of
more active dissent.
   Leading activists such as Havel and fellow Chartist Jiri
Dienstbier and Jiri Ruml began publishing Lidove Noviny (People's
News), an underground monthly they estimated quickly gained a
readership of 4,000 and even seemed a candidate for legal
registration.
   A year later, those hopes are dashed.
   Underground journals, starved of equipment and money, cannot
reach more than a few thousand readers, making activists dependent
on foreign radio stations _ widely listened to in Czechoslovakia _
to spread their news.
   ``Our great problem is the problem of information,'' said
Charter 77 signatory Ladislav Lis. The situation has worsened, he
noted, with the passage of new laws this month imposing stiff fines
or jail terms on anyone circulating any documents deemed
anti-Communist.
   Dissidents see various factors behind the change of tactics by
the authorities.
   One is that the Vienna conference reviewing implementation of
the 1975 Helsinki Final Act has ended. At that forum,
Czechoslovakia found itself under fire for repression of known
dissidents.
   Now, the authorities assure Western diplomats they will
implement the Vienna accords _ they appear willing, for instance,
to make it easier for millions of citizens to travel to the West _
but are not giving rein to groups they view as anti-Communist
enemies.
   Probably the biggest factor in the changed tactics is the
response to mass anti-government protests that occurred in August,
October and January.
   Prague, a charming city of winding alleys, towers and steeples,
is the only capital in Europe where riot police appeared on the
streets six times in five months, using tear gas, batons, dogs,
water cannon and even armored personnel carriers to disperse
peaceful crowds.
   Thousands of intellectuals signed at least three different
petitions to the government protesting the police actions and the
detention of Havel and other dissidents.
   The crackdown on known dissenters since has signaled the
authorities' determination not to allow Charter 77 a voice in
politics.
   Instead, an official committee was created in December to
monitor human rights. Two officials, Vladimir Flegel and Zbynek
Vokrouhlicky, said in an interview they have already solved 65
cases where citizens previously were refused permission to travel
abroad.
   But the committee has not spoken out against the police
brutality in January and against toughened penalties on violating
public order, an indication of authorities' desire to maintain
control over political and social activity.
   Yet change could be in the offing.
   There have been few if any reprisals against the intellectuals
who signed the petitions, an indication that at least some of the
country's Communist leaders realize they cannot isolate the brains
they need to revitalize an increasingly stagnant economy.
   A well-informed source who asked not to be identified reported
that at a meeting in mid-March, senior party leaders and economists
discussed a plan to open the economy and allow some political
liberalization.
   The plan _ the work of economist Valtr Komarek, who drew
attention late last year with highly critical analyses of the
Czechoslovak economy _ was rejected when first put to party leaders
last December.
   Now, the source reported, it appears to have at least partial
support from party leader Milos Jakes, who Western diplomats
believe is under some pressure from the Kremlin to open up to
reform.

<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters on Tuesday rejected a proposal to increase
the sales tax half a penny to finance an $8.4 billion expansion of
the growth-burdened Phoenix area's mass transit system.
   With ballots from 923 of 1,093 precincts counted, the tax
increase had 114,618 votes, or 38.5 percent, to 182,833 votes, or
61.5 percent, against.
   ``Obviously this train is not leaving the station,'' said Mayor
Terry Goddard.
   The 30-year tax increase would have paid for a system which had
been hailed by some as the metropolitan area's salvation from
traffic jams and hazy skies and condemned by others as a white
elephant.
   County Recorder Helen Purcell had predicted a 30 percent
turnout, or around 265,000 registered voters, for the vote on
Proposition 300, the seed ballot for the ValTrans system.
   Approval would have raised the sales tax in most of the county
to 7 percent by July 1.
   Proposition 300 asked voters to fund a 103-mile elevated
railway, 23 miles of rush-hour train service along regular tracks,
freeway lanes for multiple-passenger vehicles and a bus system
expanded from 350 buses to 1,500.
   The Regional Public Transportation Authority had projected a
$44-per-year cost to the average household. But a study by the
Arizona Tax Research Associations put the cost at $82 to $107.
   ValTrans was pushed as a way to reduce both air pollution and
the nation's second-highest rates for auto insurance, to unclog
city streets and to help families get rid of second or third cars.
   Opponents said Phoenix was too spread out for mass transit.
   ValTrans was the second version of Proposition 300 put before
voters in 3{ years.
   The first, approved by more than two-thirds of the voters in
October 1985, created the RPTA to plan for growth. It also
instituted a 20-year, half-cent sales tax for 231 miles of freeways.
   So far, three miles have been completed and 22 miles are under
construction.
   RPTA planners said ValTrans' first impact would have been more
buses and routes beginning in September. The 10-year, rush-hour
train service between Chandler and downtown Phoenix would have
begun in 1991.
   The initial 24 miles of the light-rail system between Glendale
and Tempe would have opened in 1995.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has made a few changes to the
White House grounds, but the woodshed out back remains.
   You won't find it by the new horseshoe pit Bush had installed,
or the ``Beware of Dog'' sign he posted by the Rose Garden.
   The woodshed is invisible, fabricated by onetime budget director
David Stockman during a contrite 1981 news conference.
   Just as Stockman claimed he was ``taken to the woodshed'' by
President Reagan for his public criticism of the president's
economic policies, so was White House counsel C. Boyden Gray
rebuked for publicly raising questions about a day-old bipartisan
agreement on Nicaragua endorsed by the president.
   In both cases, the dressing-down may have been more for show
than for real, and parallels can be drawn between the two incidents.
   Gray, in an interview with The New York Times, suggested the new
agreement with Congress on Central America diluted the
constitutional powers of the president.
   The statement questioning a presidential decision was highly
unusual coming from a White House subordinate, and the
reverberations were almost immediate.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater _ asked at his
daily news briefing if Gray had yet been to the woodshed over his
remarks _ said the official, in fact, had just met privately on
that very matter with both Bush and chief of staff John Sununu.
   ``They had a polite discussion about how things work in the
White House,'' Fitzwater said.
   And Bush, asked for his reaction to Gray's criticism, said
pointedly: ``I shared my reaction with Boyden, which is the way I
handle things.''
   Stockman found himself in hot water when his skepticism about
the ability of Reaganomics to make a dent in the budget deficit
found its way into an article in the Atlantic Monthly.
   And one of the first people Stockman sought out for advice was
Bush, according to no less a source than Bush himself.
   In his 1987 biography, ``Looking Forward,'' Bush said, ``A
forlorn figure in a dark blue suit showed up at my office seeking
advice.''
   It was Stockman. Bush said the youthful budget director told him
that he believed his comments to writer William Greider had been
off the record, which Bush said seemed a little naive because
Stockman also told him Greider had a tape recorder going.
   ``When Dave finished telling his story, my advice was that he go
down to the Oval Office as soon as possible, get an appointment
with the president, and give him the same account he'd just given
me. `Admit you've made a mistake and apologize,' I advised him.
   ``My thought was that everyone's entitled to one mistake,'' Bush
wrote.
   Stockman, in his 1986 book, ``The Triumph of Politics,'' claims
he wasn't scolded by Reagan in the Oval Office meeting that
followed. In fact, he wrote, Reagan asked him to stay on, saying
``I need your help.''
   Stockman, who resigned his White House job four years later, saw
his book become a best seller and went on to become a Wall Street
financial consultant, said he created the ``woodshed story'' to
appease other White House aides.
   Stockman said the line about him having been called on the
carpet by Reagan was demanded by an enraged chief of staff, James
A. Baker III, who told him it was the only way he could save his
job.
   Baker, now the secretary of state, also figures prominently in
the recent episode.
   Gray's voicing of concerns about the constitutionality of the
Central American agreement marked the second time the White House
counsel had challenged Baker, who was the chief architect of the
accord. Earlier, Gray raised conflict-of-interest questions about
stocks Baker held in a New York bank because it was a Third World
creditor. Baker sold his holdings as a result.
   Any conversation between Baker and Gray at the woodshed remains
unreported. Meanwhile, White House officials are taking the flap in
stride, even with a measure of humor.
   ``First of all, I want to announce that Boyden Gray concurs in
the constitutionality of the Easter Egg Roll,'' Fitzwater said at
the outset of his briefing on woodshed day. ``I checked with him
myself.''

<HEAD>Accident Blamed on Drunken Driver Leads to Strong Recommendations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials are calling for
tougher drunken driving laws and want the oldest one-fifth of the
nation's school buses off the road, in response to the United
States' worst alcohol-related highway accident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, ending its inquiry
into the May 1988 head-on collision that killed 24 children and
three adults aboard a Kentucky church bus, adopted a long list of
recommendations for federal and state officials Tuesday.
   Flames spread through the bus after it collided with a pickup
truck that was going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near
Carrollton, Ky. Authorities said the pickup driver had a blood
alcohol content of .26 in tests 90 minutes after the accident, and
a board investigator said Tuesday he likely was at .29 when the
collision occurred, which is nearly three times the legal level of
presumed intoxication.
   All 27 deaths aboard the bus, which belonged to the First
Assembly of God in Radcliff, were attributed to smoke inhalation,
the board said. Forty people escaped, most with injuries. The bus
was returning from an amusement park near Cincinnati.
   The NTSB's acting chairman, James L. Kolstad, said the May 14
collision ``may be one of the most influential highway accidents
the board has ever heard.''
   The board said the accident clearly was caused by ``the
alcohol-impaired condition'' of the pickup truck driver, Larry
Mahoney, 35, of Worthville, Ky., who is free on $540,000 bail
awaiting a November trial on 27 counts of murder.
   But the board also said characteristics of the 11-year-old
former school bus contributed to the accident's severity. The
vehicle's unprotected fuel tank, flammable seat covers and a rear
door partially obstructed by the last row of seats were all noted
in the report which was adopted after a daylong session.
   The Ford bus was assembled by Sheller-Globe Corp. of Toledo,
Ohio. Last July, both Ford and Sheller-Globe reached out-of-court
settlements for undisclosed amounts with families of nearly all the
victims' families. Neither company admitted any liability.
   The board recommended that states set a date for phase-out of
buses not meeting 1977 federal standards. If adopted nationwide,
the rule would affect 77,000 school buses, about 22 percent of
those now in use. It would also affect thousands of former school
buses used by church groups and other organizations.
   The 1977 standards required strengthened fuel systems, stronger
seats, toughened roof and body joints and more accessible exits.
   The five-member board also asked states to toughen their
drunken-driving laws to allow police to revoke drivers' licenses,
to prohibit plea-bargaining in drunken-driving cases and to end the
practice of giving convicted drunken drivers reduced licensing
penalties if they enroll in treatment programs.
   Among safety improvements suggested by the NTSB, which has no
enforcement powers and can only recommend actions to other federal
agencies and the states, were making seatcovers out of fire
retardant material, putting more exits on school buses and making
their fuel tanks more resistant to puncture in severe accidents.
   The board noted that a three-inch tear in the fuel tank on the
Kentucky bus led to the fire that engulfed the vehicle.
   But the board said it was unclear whether such strengthening
measures would have prevented the fuel tank rupture, which it said
was probably caused by a spring broken loose in the collision. It
also noted that flame-retardant requirements did not change under
the 1977 rules.
   The bus involved in the crash was built two weeks before the
stiffened federal school bus safety requirements took effect April
1, 1977.
   Among specific board recommendations were:
   _That the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration require
more fire-retardant material in bus seatcovers.
   _That school buses be made to meet the same standards for exit
doors imposed on public transit buses, including the installation
of either more exits or pop-out windows.
   _That the safety administration evaluate and revise, if
necessary, its standards on the placement of school bus fuel tanks,
plus adding various protective structures around the tanks, in
addition to cages required under the 1977 law.
   _That the Federal Highway Administration conduct a test of
increasing the number of ``wrong way'' signs on divided highways to
determine the signs' effectiveness in reducing wrong-way accidents,
which the board said kill an average of more than 270 people a year.
   _That church groups and other private organizations purchase
only buses that meet the post-1977 standards.
   Micky Sadoff, president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving,
praised the recommendations but said she was saddened that the
board focused more on bus safety than drunken driving.
   ``We wouldn't want to put down bus safety in any way,'' she
said, but added, ``The equivalent of a fully loaded 747 crashing
every week for a year equals the number of fatalities on our roads
due to drunk driving.''
   The board said 51 percent of the 46,000 annual fatalities are
attributable to alcohol use.

   President Bush says proposals to legalize
narcotics are ``180 degrees wrong'' and the entertainment industry
should stop depicting drugs as a humorous or harmless diversion.
   ``We have to change the way this problem has been looked at,''
the president said Tuesday during a question-and-answer session
with about 100 civic class students at a high school in a Virginia
suburb of Washington.
   Inching further away from his once ironclad opposition to
tighter gun controls, Bush also said ``maybe there's a need for
more laws'' to restrict the semiautomatic assault-style weapons
that are used in drug-related violence.
   And he backed away from his earlier support of the proposal for
a 51 percent pay increase for members of Congress _ an idea that
died under a tidal wave of public opposition.
   ``In retrospect,'' Bush said, ``it was too big a bite at once
and the country didn't support it at all. So to accommodate the
needs, the legitimate needs for a raise, it has to be done
differently.''
   Fielding a question on foreign policy, Bush said the United
States is ``the only country that can be a substantial catalyst for
peace' in the Middle East.
   Bush will hold separats at the White House next week
with Egyptian President Hosni Mu and Israeli Foreign Minister
Yitzhak Shamir. ``We will be probing as best we can and making
suggestions to them as to what the U.S. can do in trying to bring
about peace in the Middle East,'' Bush said.
   The president talked with students during a surprise visit to
James Madison High School in the Virginia suburb of Vienna, about
15 miles from the White House. The school had only 90 minutes'
warning he was coming.
   To the delight of hundreds of chatting teen-agers in the school
cafeteria, Bush had lunch with them, eating pizza and french fries
and sipping milk through a straw.
   In the school library, Bush perched on a stool and answered
questions for 30 minutes.
   Bemoaning ``this stupid abuse of drugs,'' Bush said that ``for a
while in this country, it seemed to be we condoned those things we
should condemn.''
   ``And we went through a period where the treatment, for example,
of the use of cocaine in movies was done in a humorous vein or some
kind of, well, harmless, but made the user look like some kind of
silly idiot,'' he said. ``But nothing ... condemnatory.
   ``And so, we've got to mobilize the entertainment media and say,
look, don't put out great emotion in favor of or treat these _ in
favor of cocaine or other drugs.''
   Bush said he recognizes that students are under pressure from
their peers to experiment with drugs. He suggested that schools try
to educate students ``about the damage that comes from substance
abuse.''
   He said that ``people used to talk about legalizing narcotics.''
Without naming names, he said, ``And that was some very serious
people. And I just think it's 180 degrees wrong.''
   Answering a question about international terrorism, Bush said,
``It's like dealing with fog _ you can't get hold of it very well.''
   In another development, Bush said he was still seeking
clarifications from Japan on building the advanced FSX jet fighter
and that efforts to nail down an agreement were ``going back and
forth a little.''
   Administration officials said the final go-ahead on the joint
project was being delayed by haggling with Japan over who will own
the technology and how many planes would be U.S.-built.
   It is possible that a Japanese-set Friday deadline for a final
decision may be missed, said the officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity. However, officials also sought to dispel the idea
that the project was unraveling and said a deal was still
considered likely.

   Dick Thornburgh says his thoughts were on
securing his first state budget when he began the day March 28,
1979, but instead he wound up dealing with the nation's worst
commercial nuclear accident.
   Now U.S. Attorney General, Thornburgh had been Pennsylvania
governor 72 days when a stuck valve at the Three Mile Island plant
allowed vital cooling water to drain from the Unit 2 reactor's
radioactive core.
   Although the plant was just 10 miles from the Capitol in
Harrisburg, it could have been on the other side of the planet as
far as Thornburgh's understanding of nuclear energy was concerned.
Nuclear jargon ``was like a foreign language to me,'' he said
Tuesday in a speech at the National Press Club.
   Still, Thornburgh was a quick study, and is widely credited for
his calm handling of the accident.
   In Tuesday's speech, as in a speech he gave four years ago at
Duke University, Thornburgh said he learned that a manager ``should
not be afraid to scramble the organization chart, as we did during
Three Mile Island.''
   He compared his handling of the accident to President Kennedy
during the Cuban missile crisis, ``when his own brother's advice
weighed more heavily with him than that of the secretary of State
or the Joint Chiefs of Staff.''
   No one was hurt during the accident, although radioactive gas
was released into the atmosphere and pregnant women and
preschoolers were advised by Thornburgh to evacuate within five
miles of the plant.
   Thornburgh said he learned another lesson at TMI: ``respect but
do not depend on the news media.'' While much of the reporting of
the accident was reliable, he said some was ``downright
outrageous.''
   Thornburgh added a postscript to Tuesday's speech, saying the
1986 accident at Chernobyl that killed at least 31 people ``might
have been prevented if the people of the Soviet Union were as free
to question their authorities'' as were Americans in 1979.
   After TMI, Thornburgh served a second term as governor beginning
in 1982, then headed the Institute of Politics at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government before becoming attorney
general last August.
   On other matters Tuesday, Thornburgh:
   _Said the question of whether special investigations should be
required for members of Congress suspected of criminal wrongdoing
would be resolved ``at an early date.''
   An order signed by Thornburgh's predecessor, Edwin Meese III,
called for attorneys general to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate serious allegations against congressmen and senators.
   ``I'm no great fan of independent counsels, period,'' Thornburgh
said, adding that a review of Meese's order was nearing completion.
   _Said he was unaware of a contingency plan for any federal
takeover of the police department in the District of Columbia,
which has been plagued by drug-related murders.
   _Sidestepped a question on the appropriateness of a suit against
random drug testing filed by Executive Office employees. While
declining to give an ``offhand'' opinion of the suit, Thornburgh
said he was encouraged by recent Supreme Court rulings upholding
U.S. Customs Service drug testing and post-accident drug testing by
railroads.
   ``The validation of drug testing by the Supreme Court does send
in my view a very positive signal _ gives a green light _ to those
in the private sector who want to use sound drug testing programs
to ensure a drug-free workplace,'' he said.

<HEAD>With USS Stark Death Claims Settled, Claims for Injured Begin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon is preparing claims on behalf of
the 21 sailors injured in a missile attack on the USS Stark now
that Iraq has agreed to compensate the families of the 37 killed in
the 1987 incident.
   The United States also intends to ask Iraq for compensation to
cover the $82.9 million repair bill for the guided missile frigate,
which was badly damaged when two French-made Exocet missiles were
fired at the ship as it steamed through the Persian Gulf.
   ``We intend to move quickly to file those claims'' now that Iraq
has agreed to pay $27.3 million for the dead, a Defense Department
official said Tuesday after the State Department announced the
settlement with Iraq.
   Among the 60 claims still to be filed against Iraq are several
on behalf of two seamen seriously injured in the fiery attack, and
others on behalf of servicemen who suffered light burns and other
injuries, officials said.
   The officials said the United States wanted to see the outcome
of the claim for the dead before submitting those for the survivors.
   ``The government of Iraq has undertaken to make prompt payment
of the full amount,'' said a defense official. ``Payments will be
made to the families as quickly as possible after the receipt of
the funds.''
   Iraq's agreement to settle the claim was viewed by the State
Department as a ``good sign,'' said one diplomat. ``Further lack of
progress in the case could have affected relations,'' he added,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States renewed its ties with Iraq in 1984 after a
17-year break and has sought to maintain a steady improvement
despite some tensions.
   Iraq apologized for the missile attack, which occurred at the
height of the Iran-Iraq ``tanker war,'' saying the pilot mistook
the Stark for an enemy Iranian vessel. After an investigation, the
United States accepted the explanation.
   The U.S. claim was presented 11 months ago but it took a trip to
Baghdad last week by one of the department's top trouble shooters,
legal adviser Abraham Sofaer, to nudge the Iraqis into action.
   Officials said the American team was called in to see Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz on Monday ``and told that this was what
(Iraqi) President (Saddam) Hussein had decided.''
   ``There were no negotiations,'' one source continued. ``They
just announced this was what they were prepared to pay.''
   The U.S. team decided it was better to settle for slightly less
than the original claim of $29.6 million in order to prevent
further delays, the officials said.
   Each family will get an average of $740,000 according to a
formula that takes into account the servicemen's remaining
dependents.
   After the attack, the Stark spent several months undergoing
temporary repairs in Bahrain before returning with its surviving
crew members to their home base in Mayport, Fla., near
Jacksonville, in August 1987.
   The Stark later sailed to the shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss.,
where it was built, for extensive repairs. It returned to fleet
duty in Mayport in September 1988.
   Settlement of the Stark compensation brought to mind the
unsettled claims of 290 victims of another Persian Gulf attack _
those killed when the USS Vincennes mistakenly shot down an Iranian
airliner over the gulf last year.
   The United States says it has not gotten specifics about those
killed and therefore has been unable to determine the compensation.
   ``We've tried a number of channels to obtain information,'' but
nothing has been accomplished over the past several months, said a
U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Regional Expenses of Raising Soybeans Vary Within Both US, Brazil</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study by the Agriculture Department says
that Brazil and the United States both have some cost advantages in
the production of soybeans, but that the expenses vary greatly from
region to region in each country.
   Brazil is the chief competitor of American farmers in the
lucrative world soybean market and is expected to harvest a record
crop this year. Argentina also has been expanding production.
   The United States has a big lead in global soybean output,
producing 41.9 million metric tons of the world's 93.4 million tons
forecast for the 1988-89 harvest. Brazil's harvest is currently
indicated at 21 million tons, and Argentina's 8.5 million.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of soybeans.
   Questions have been raised about costs of production and whether
American farmers can continue to compete with the growing output in
the Southern Hemisphere countries, particularly Brazil.
   The study by the department's Economic Research Service offered
no final answer to the debate but did pinpoint a number of regional
cost differences in each country.
   For example, the study showed that American farmers generally
have an edge with lower ``variable'' costs of production, which
includes expenses for fertilizer, weedkillers, seeds and labor. But
``fixed'' costs are higher than in Brazil. Those include general
farm overhead, taxes, insurance and interest payments.
   In the United States, using 1986 figures, the soybean regions
with the lowest variable costs are the Corn Belt, Lake States and
Northern Plains regions, with production costs averaging in a range
$50 to $60 per ton. Those areas account for about 70 percent of the
U.S. soybean area.
   But when the Southeast and Delta regions are included, the
average variable cost jumps sharply to $110 per ton.
   ``Given the substantial portion of U.S. soybean area outside the
Corn Belt-Lake States region, use of data from this region alone
may be inappropriate for making comparisons with Brazil and
Argentina,'' the report said.
   Looking at Brazil, the analysts noted that the traditional
soybean area is in the south, including the states of Rio Grande do
Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana and Sao Paulo. These states accounted
for about 92 percent of Brazil's soybean area in 1977 _ but less
than 64 percent in 1986.
   ``Therefore, it is no more correct to talk of the traditional
region as typical of Brazilian production than it is to talk of the
Corn Belt-Lake States region as typical of U.S. production,'' the
report said.
   Variable costs of production range from $102 per ton in Sao
Paulo to $203 in Bahia, one of the regions of soybean expansion.
   ``In absolute terms,'' the report said, ``these cost figures
indicate that Brazil's cash expenses are high relative to the
United States and that Brazil's soybean expansion has occurred
despite high variable costs of production.''
   The report added: ``One obvious hypothesis is that the low cost
of land is driving the expansion of soybeans in Brazil.''

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought 550,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for delivery in
the 1988-89 marketing year that began on Sept. 1, the first in
almost three months.
   Although Moscow has been buying U.S. wheat regularly under an
export subsidy program, it was the first significant corn purchase
since Jan. 4, officials said Tuesday.
   The corn, which is not subsidized under the export program, is
scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the sixth year of a
long-term grain supply agreement between the Soviet Union and the
United States.
   Officials said the latest sales brought total corn sold to the
Soviets for 1988-89 to more than 10.7 million tons. Additionally,
sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans,
1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 550,000 tons of
corn would be about 21.7 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.61 per bushel at the
farm level, according to USDA estimates, meaning that the latest
sale could have a farm value of around $1.4 million.

   Citrus and apples from the Empalme area of
Sonora, Mexico, must be treated as a precaution against exotic
fruit flies before entering the United States, according to a new
Agriculture Department rule.
   Peaches from the area are banned completely from entering the
U.S. market. The restrictions took effect on March 24 but were not
officially announced until Tuesday.
   Larry B. Slagle, acting administrator of the department's Animal
and Plant Health Inspection Service, said federal inspectors ``have
confirmed an infestation of Mexican fruit flies in the municipality
of Empalme.''
   Citrus fruit from Empalme must be fumigated before shipment to
the United States. Apples have to undergo a cold treatment to kill
possible pests. But Slagle said there is ``no acceptable
treatment'' for peaches.

<HEAD>Illegal Contributions to Glenn Campaign, Ford Group, Prompt Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bekins Co. and 11 of its employees were fined
$18,250 for making illegal contributions to Sen. John Glenn's 1984
Democratic presidential campaign, federal records show.
   The contributions, amounting to $3,750, broke the law because
the company paid the employees for making them, according to
Federal Election Commission records made available Tuesday.
Corporations are not allowed to contribute to presidential or
congressional campaigns.
   ``Most of the 15 employee-contributors were reimbursed, some
through `grossing up' of their annual incentive bonuses and some
through their expense accounts,'' said a report by the commission's
general counsel. ``Some employees who received reimbursement did
not even know they were reimbursed.''
   The contributions began after Irwin Jacobs, chairman of Bekins'
parent company, Minstar Inc., asked Bekins' president at the time,
Albert Labinger, to solicit contributions for the Glenn campaign,
the report said.
   Jacobs also was a member of the Glenn campaign's finance
committee.
   Some of those who were asked to give money to the campaign said
that they felt pressured to do so, the commission's report said.
   The company agreed to pay a $4,000 fine, and Labinger agreed to
a $4,500 fine, and Roger Lee, who was Bekins' chief financial
officer at the time, agreed to pay a $5,000 fine.
   Ronald Hartman, the company's general counsel, was fined $2,000
and Richard Morse, a vice president for personnel, paid a $1,000
fine, the commission said. Seven other employees each agreed to pay
$250 fines.
   On a separate matter, a political action committee organized to
support the causes of former President Ford agreed to pay a $1,500
fine for accepting $15,000 from state organizations that could have
received the money in ways that are legal at the state level but
are not allowed in federal campaigns.
   The Gerald R. Ford _ New Leadership Committee received $5,000
contributions each from the re-election campaign of Texas Gov. Bill
Clements, the 1986 Idaho gubernatorial campaign of David Leroy and
the 1986 campaign of Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden.
   Idaho and Kansas permit corporations to give money directly to
political candidates and Texas allows individuals to give unlimited
amounts to candidates, the commission said.
   In addition to prohibiting corporate contributions to federal
campaigns, the national law also limits individuals to giving no
more than $1,000 per election to any one candidate.
   The commission found that the Ford committee broke the law by
mingling that money with cash intended to support candidates for
federal office.
   Both the Ford case and the Bekins case were settled in the past
few months, but the files had remained sealed until Tuesday.

   Ringo Starr is back at work at Abbey Road studios
for the first time since his treatment for alcohol abuse, and all
he had to do was act naturally.
   ``Ringo looked terrifically healthy and well when he arrived at
Abbey Road. He was bright-eyed and very entertaining all day,''
said country singer Buck Owens.
   The former Beatle recorded a new version of his 1965 hit, ``Act
Naturally,'' with Owens, who wrote the song.
   Starr, 48, and his wife, 38-year-old actress Barbara Bach, spent
five weeks undergoing treatment at a clinic in Arizona last year.
   The Owens-Starr duet will be the title track of an album to be
released this summer.
   ``Ringo must be the most down-to-earth famous person I have ever
met,'' Owens said Tuesday. ``I know a lot of people who have had
his kind of problems. But it is not everyone who has the intestinal
fortitude to stand up and tell the world: `I've got a problem and
I'm going to get some help.'''

   The Pointer Sisters are looking for a
new record label and are talking with Motown Records, said June
Pointer.
   Their last two albums _ ``Hot Together'' and ``Serious Slammin''
_ sold poorly because they didn't get the proper attention from
RCA, leading to the group's split with the label, said Ms. Pointer,
who performs with her sisters, Bonnie, Anita and Ruth.
   She recalled during an interview that her parents, the Rev.
Elton and Sarah Pointer, who didn't allow pop music in their home,
were troubled by their daughters' choice to embark on a show
business career.
   But their 1973 debut album went gold, and by 1976, the sisters
became the first black women to perform at the Grand Ole Opry with
their first Grammy winning song ``Fairy Tale.'' They received two
Grammys in 1983, for the singles ``Jump'' and ``Automatic.''
   Although their father died in 1979, their parents saw the group
make those first stabs at success and gave their daughters their
blessing to perform, Ms. Pointer said. ``After the turnaround, when
we had health insurance and money in the bank, then they could come
to the shows and enjoy themselves,'' she said.

   A Spanish court has acquitted flamenco star
Lola Flores of tax fraud charges, handing the government a setback
in its highly publicized campaign to crack down on tax evaders.
   But court officials said Tuesday the Madrid Provincial Court
ruled Flores could be subject to administrative sanctions for
failing to file tax returns between 1982 and 1985. The officials
did not say how much she would have to pay.
   About $1.3 million had been sought in back taxes and penalties
from Flores and up to two years in prison.
   During her trial this month, Flores said she did not have money
to pay off the tax ministry, adding she never thought she would be
prosecuted for what she called an innocent mistake.
   Flores, 66, starred as a Gypsy girl in numerous films in the
1940s and 1950s that popularized abroad the image of a poor but
happy Spaniard dancing the flamenco.

   Retired football star Dick Butkus was
going to use the 50-yard line of University of Illinois' football
field to announce a $22.7 million hotel-restaurant project.
   But he changed his game plan amid accusations of favoritism,
making the announcement instead at a campus faculty center.
   The Trade Centre South project, a half-mile southwest of campus,
will hold a 140-unit hotel and a 120,000-square-foot office
building. Butkus' restaurant will be connected to the hotel.
   Butkus, 46, said Tuesday he chose Champaign for his first
restaurant because he still has ties to the community, though he
lives on the West Coast.
   ``I'm from Chicago and still an Illinois guy,'' the former
Chicago Bears linebacker said. ``Champaign has always been good to
me.''
   But his hopes of announcing the project at Memorial Stadium,
where he played ball more than 20 years ago, were blocked when
restaurateurs complained and university officials ordered the news
conference moved.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Halts Campbell Execution By Hanging</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man convicted in three slayings won a reprieve
from death from a federal appeals court 33 hours before he was
scheduled to become the first person executed by hanging in the
nation since 1965.
   Richard Bauer, a prison administrative assistant, said Charles
Rodman Campbell responded to a letter informing him of the ruling
by laughing and saying, ``It's about time.''
   A three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Tuesday agreed to stay the execution after Campbell's attorneys
filed a notice of appeal and briefs with the court earlier in the
day.
   ``We're surprised and disappointed,'' said assistant state
attorney general James Hansen, who said the court ruled without
hearing the state's arguments.
   ``We were just getting ready to fax the documents when we got
the ruling.''
   Even if the appeal fails, Hansen said the earliest date for
execution could be a year from now.
   Campbell had exhausted his bid for a stay in state courts. A
federal appeal was rejected Monday by U.S. District Judge John
Coughenour in Seattle, who said he found no merit in Campbell's
claim that his trial lawyers ineffectively represented him.
   ``I am very, very pleased,'' said defense attorney Al Lyon.
``That goes without saying. It has been a lot of late, late
nights.''
   Campbell had been scheduled to hang just after midnight Thursday
morning at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla.
   He would have been the first person executed by hanging in the
United States since Kansas put four men to death in 1965, including
Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith, whose story was told
in Truman Capote's book ``In Cold Blood.''
   Hanging is Washington's official form of execution, although a
prisoner may opt for lethal injection. Campbell so far has decided
not to choose injection.
   Campbell, 34, was convicted of three counts of aggravated
first-degree murder for the 1982 throat slashings of Renae
Wicklund, 31; her 8-year-old daughter, Shannah, and a neighbor,
Barbara Hendrickson, 51.
   At the time of the killings, Campbell was on work-release from a
prison sentence for a sexual assault on Ms. Wicklund in 1976. She
and Mrs. Hendrickson had testified at his trial in 1978.
   The last person executed in Washington state was Joseph Chester
Self, hanged June 20, 1963, for killing a Seattle cab driver. He
was the 73rd man executed in state history.
   Campbell is one of seven men on Washington's death row.

<HEAD>GM Recalls More Than 600,000 Cars for Pollution Control Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors has recalled more than half a
million 1984 Oldsmobiles and Buicks because of problems with a
pollution control switch.
   The Environmental Protection Agency, in requesting the recall,
said the thermal vacuum switch failed to open and close at the
proper times, allowing gasoline vapor to escape into the atmosphere.
   The vapor, combined with other pollutants and heated by the sun,
forms smog, the EPA said.
   The problem has brought at least 3.5 million General Motors
Corp. cars and trucks back for repairs.
   GM recalled the 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Delta 88,
Ninety-Eight, Toronado and Custom Cruiser; and the 1984 Buick
LeSabre, Estate Wagon, Electra and Riviera. The cars are all
equipped with the five-liter engine.
   The company estimated the number of cars involved at 672,117
vehicles, about 37,000 more than the EPA estimated.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Slightly, Shares Up To New High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar edged up against the Japanese yen
Wednesday, while share prices rose to a new high on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 133.25 yen, up 0.35 yen from Tuesday's
132.90-yen finish. The currency opened at 133.50 yen and moved in a
range between 133.10 yen and 133.50 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
793.96 points Tuesday to score the largest single-day gain this
year, added another 430.92 points, or 1.33 percent, to finish
trading at 32,737.28, yet another high.
   The market's main index continued to rise after Tuesday's sharp
gain, boosted by a strong buying mood, dealers said.
   Investors have been buying stocks actively since Tuesday, which
marked the start of the new business year, when a rise in buy
orders is common, said one dealer with a major securities firm,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   On the foreign exchange market, traders said the dollar was
bullish despite joint intervention overnight by the U.S. and
Western European central banks to halt the currency's recent rise.
   Although there was no incentive to buy the yen, the dollar was
lower toward the end of Wednesday's morning session due to
dollar-selling by speculative investors looking for a profit, said
a trader with the Bank of Tokyo, also speaking anonymously.
   Another trader said the dollar was unlikely to keep rising
because participants have begun speculating that the Finance
Ministry and the Bank of Japan will call for dollar-selling and
prepare to intervene in the market.
   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama indicated possible central bank
intervention early Wednesday at a press conference, after a special
Cabinet meeting, and repeated his comments Tuesday that the current
yen-dollar rate should ``be viewed with caution.''
   The yen-selling trend has been widely attributed to the ongoing
Recruit stock trading scandal.
   On Tuesday, Tokyo prosecutors arrested a second public official,
former Vice Minister of Education Kunio Takaishi, in connection
with the scandal, bringing to 13 the number arrested to date.
   Recruit Co., a fast-growing information-service conglomerate,
sold bargain-priced unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary to
more than 150 government officials, politicians and business
executives who later reaped large profits after the value of the
shares soared in over-the-counter trading.
   Prosecutors have charged that the transactions constituted
bribery in return for favors.

   Hollywood's brightest stars were trying hard
to keep their cool amid the competitive atmosphere of tonight's
61st Academy Awards ceremonies.
   The extravaganza takes place against a feverish backdrop of
ticket scalping, thievery, political demonstrations and last-minute
preparations.
   Tickets for the ceremony were selling for more than $2,000 and
Oscar guards were looking for someone who stole 40 passes for the
show.
   Scores of fans who arrived early were eagerly awaiting the
arrival of their favorite stars. Minutes after Oscar bleachers
opened Tuesday afternoon, dozens of spectators streamed in.
Thousands were expected by the show's opening.
   One early arrival, Samuel Scott of Los Angeles, said: ``It's
like a family get-together because each year you see the same
people. ... You discuss differenictures that you've taken and
what you've been up to. I don't g tired of it.''
   Predictions for best picture, best actress, best supporting
actor and best supporting actr
   Any variety of upsets were considered possible.
   Only actor Dustin Hoffman and director Barry Levinson of ``Rain
Man'' will enter the Shrine Auditorium as heavy favorites to win
statuettes.
   One of the evening's tightest racebest supporting
actress _ will be decided the earliest when Melfith and
Don Johnson present thst trophy.
    best supporting actress award are
Frances McDomand for ``Mississippi Burning''gourney Weaver
for ``Working Gir nominees are Joan Cusack for ``Working
Girl,'' Geena Davis foand Michelle
Pfeiffer for ``Dangerous Liaisons.''
   The fate of ``Rain Man,' road drama of aove that received the most
nominations _ nine, will become clearer
when the original score trophy is presented ter. If
Hans Zimmer wins that pand the film claims the art direction
Oscar three categories later, ``Rain Man'' likely will go on to
dominate.
   Yet ``Rain Man'' faces strong challenges from ``Dangerousiaisons,''
the saga of sexual gaship and deceit in
pre-Revolutiy France, the baseball film ``Bull Durham,'' thecivil rights
drama ``Mississippiaction-adventure
spectacle ``Die Hard.''
   The major awards _ best actress, best actor and b picture _
will be handed out near the conclusion of producer Allan Carr's
elaborate Oscar prentations. The spectacle is being broadcast
nationally by ABC-TV starting at 9 p.m. EST.
   Alfavored to win best actor, he competes
against a highly respected field: Gene Hackman for ``Misi
Burning,'' Tom Hanks for ``Big,'' Edward James Olmos for ``Stand
and Deliver'' and Max von Sydow for ``Pellehe Conqueror.''
   And while ``Rain Man'' is eo win best picture, the
other nominated films aly not long shots: ``The
Accidental Tourist,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Mississippi
Burning'' and ``Working G'' are considered to be strong films.
   The mictable race is probably best actress, with Glenn
Close (``Dangerous Liaisons'') heading the list. Also nominatare
Jodie Foster (``The Accused''), Miss Griffith (``Working Girl''),
Meryl Streep (``A Cry in the Dark'') and`Gorillas in
the Mist'').
   Some things Oscar-related, however, are usually more
predictable, and that inclcrises and near crises
that accompany the elaborate self-congratulatory exercise.
   This year, such developments include the 60 tickets
from the headquarters of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts
Sciences. A man identifying himself asresentative of 20th
Century Fox collected 40 reats for the awards ceremony and
20 seats for thGovernors Ball. The academy has printed
duplicates for the Fox tudio.
   As the producers prepared the show, protesters pickeed the
studios of MGM-United Artists, demanding an apology for the comic
depiction of stuttering in ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' which garnered
three nominations.
   ``If younldren across the country are watching this film,
they really won't understand how the person who stutters is abused
verbally and shamed by everyone around him,'' said Mark Power, a
member oNational Stuttering Project advird.
   Other protesters were expected to focuse Last
Temptation of Christ,'' which a variety of Christian leaders
denounced last year for its depiction of Jesus as doubting and
sexually tilm received one nomination _ for director
Martin Scorsese.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Aminullah was playing near the airport
when a blazing point of light descended from the sky and burned his
face, arms and legs.
   The device doctors say will leave Aminullah scarred for life was
one of the thousands of flares unleashed daily by airplanes over
Kabul to deflect the heat-seeking missiles fired by anti-communist
guerrillas.
   The flares, which arc out of the sky trailing a plume of white
smoke, are a common sight _ as much a part of the Kabul panorama as
the snow-capped mountains surrounding the city of mud-brick houses
and open sewers.
   But they are still a mystery to Aminullah and his mother, Gul
Babu, a widow with three other children.
   ``There is no special warning program about the flares,'' said
Dr. Lal Mohammad who attends burn victims at the Indira Gandhi
Children's Hospital. ``We tell the women who bring their children
here to spread the word to the others.''
   He said as many as six children are admitted each week to the
Gandhi hospital with severe burns caused by the flares that are
fired or dropped by Afghan military and civilian planes and Soviet
cargo planes. No statistics are available on the total number of
flare victims in the Kabul area.
   Aminullah, who like many Afghans does not use a family name, sat
on a table in the burn ward, his arms held stiffly in front of him
as doctors applied solutions.
   The top half of his face, from the scalp to the bridge of his
nose, was a brown crust with glistening red cracks. Burned tissue
had been removed from his cheeks and chin, which were a translucent
pink.
   He cried as a doctor snipped at flaps of dangling burn tissue.
   Eight other children in the room had similar burns and were
varying states of recovery.
   Mohammad said most of the flare victims suffered second-degree
burns and their wounds usually were not life-threatening.
   But to be a child in Afghanistan is not easy, even in peacetime.
   According to the United Nations Children's Fund, 30 percent of
all children born in the country die before the age of five.
Diseases claim most of the youngsters.
   In 1960, when there was relative peace in this nation of
constant political and tribal feuds, harsh winters and 75 percent
illiteracy, the child mortality rate was 38 percent.
   Government-operated television shows the children of war almost
every night as it denounces the U.S.-backed guerrillas who are
fighting to overthrow the Marxist government of President Najib.
   The decade-old war has claimed an estimated one million lives
from the pre-war population of 15 million.
   The government seldom fails to say that victims of a guerrilla
attack ``included many women and children.''
   On Sunday, the government said the guerrillas had rocketed a bus
on the Jalalabad-Kabul highway, killing all the passengers
``including women and children.'' No death toll was given but
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said the bus was
carrying at least 22 people.
   Amani said Monday an unknown number of the passengers survived,
but no death toll was given.
   On Tuesday, foreign reporters were taken to the Gandhi Hospital
to see survivors of the attack.
   Hospital staffers said they were treating two survivors _
10-year-old Shafiullah and Abbasi, 4 _ but adult victims were taken
to other hospitals. The total number of dead and injured was not
known.
   Shafiullah and Abbasi received shrapnel wounds in their legs,
according to Dr. Ashraf, head of the 250-bed hospital's orthopedic
section.
   Shafiullah was whimpering into the pillow. The doctor said he
had just learned that his mother and two brothers died in the
attack.
   Ashraf said Abbasi's uncle and cousin were killed.
   Relatives of the victims said the boys were not on a bus.
Instead, one said, they were riding in a convoy of trucks carrying
people out of Jalalabad, where the guerrillas have been besieging
government forces for three weeks.

<HEAD>Roh Orders Major Shakeup Of Military, Replacing 49 Generals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo ordered 49 top
generals transferred or retired after army hardliners criticized
him for seeking ties with communist nations and not suppressing
dissidents, officials said today.
   Roh, a former general who played a key role in the military's
seizure of power in 1980, replaced several hardliners in key
security posts with generals loyal to him, according to Korean
press reports.
   Many of the generals being replaced were allies of former
authoritarian President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Defense Ministry officials said a major shuffle had been ordered
in the army's high command but would not elaborate, declining to
say how many of the 49 generals would be retired or moved to other
posts.
   Details of the shakeup appeared today in all Seoul newspapers,
which also said a further shakeup of the army's divisional
commanders was expected to be announced in coming weeks. Dong-a
Ilbo, a leading national newspaper, said a Cabinet shuffle was also
expected.
   In a separate development, the national news agency Yonhap
reported that the heads of at least two South Korean intelligence
agencies may be fired for failing to prevent a visit to communist
North Korea by a top dissident leader.
   The military shakeup, expected to be carried out in April, came
after reports that hardliners in the government and military were
unhappy with what they saw as Roh's failure to curb anti-government
radicals and his drive to build ties with communist countries.
   Several of the changes involve key security commands in Seoul
which are seen as vital to defending the government against any
internal military threat. The army has been a major force in South
Korean politics and twice seized power in the nation's 40-year
history.
   Opposition parties said the shakeup would prevent the military
from meddling in politics. Kim Dae-jung's Party for Peace and
Democracy said hardliners had been trying to ``deter the military's
political neutrality.''
   Roh, who won presidential elections in December 1987, has
attempted to pursue a moderate policy and helped introduce broad
democratic reforms. But the government has not won the broad
support Roh has sought.
   Roh announced March 20 that he was indefinitely postponing a
promised referendum on his tenure, charging that leftist radicals
were attempting to stage a revolution. He also ordered a major
crackdown on the radical groups to end a spate of violent protests.
   But some political observers said it was unclear if Roh could
have won the referendum and a defeat would probably have forced him
to call new elections.
   Indications of the hardliners' unhappiness with Roh had been
increasing in recent weeks. A leading Cabinet hardliner,
Administration Minister Kim Yong-kap, resigned this month after
criticizing the government as not adequately suppressing
anti-government dissidents.
   Then, last week, the commandant of the country's military
academy, Lt. Gen. Min Byong-don, failed to salute Roh at annual
graduation ceremonies and made a speech criticizing government
efforts to establish ties with communist nations.
   Min is among generals to be retired under the shuffle,
newspapers said.
   Such staunchly anti-communist generals are reportedly unhappy
with Roh's drive to build political and trade relations with
communist nations so as to east the confrontation with North Korea.
   The South Korea has never had relations with communist nations.
   This week, senior generals issued an unprecedented statement
demanding that leading dissident Moon Ik-hwan be punished for
making an illegal visit to North KoreaMoon reportedly met Monday
with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to discuss reuniting the two
Koreas.
   The two Koreas are bls and Kim Il Sung ordered the
1950 invasion that started the Kan War. The Seoul government
said Moon was trying to undermine its authority anarned he would
be arrested if he returned home.   A number of eportedly involved in the
shuffle were hardliners appointed by Chun just beforehe left power
iRoh and Chun had been close allies, but their relations were
strained after Roh distanced himself from Chun's authoritarian rule
in 1987.

<HEAD>Explosion in South Lebanon, Israelis Cite Guerrilla Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RAS AL BAYADA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 Palestinian
fighters are massing in southern Lebanon in a major buildup that
could threaten Israeli settlements near the border, Israeli
military commanders say.
   The officers spoke to journalists visiting Israeli's
self-designated security zone on Tuesday, when Palestinian fighters
blew up an Israeli outpost and a second guerrilla squad was
reported captured in the zone.
   Lebanese police said a remote-controlled explosion leveled a
two-story building used by the Israeli army and its allied militia,
known as the South Lebanon Army, on the eastern edge of the Israeli
buffer zone.
   A police spokesman said two SLA militiamen were injured and an
armored personnel carrier was destroyed in the blast at the
Zumarraya crossing point into the Israeli zone, 1.8 miles north of
the Lebanese town of Hasbaya.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing rules,
said guerrillas of the radical PLO faction Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine were responsible.
   Israeli officials described the target as a bunker and said only
one SLA militiaman was injured in the blast.
   Israeli military commanders said Palestinian fighters were
staging a major buildup just north of the Israeli-controlled zone.
   Brig. Gen. Nehamiya Tamari, commander of troops stationed along
the 100-mile-long Israeli border, estimated the number of
guerrillas to be about 5,000, of whom about 600 to 700 were in
refugee camps around the Lebanese city of Tyre.
   ``The importance is not their numbers, whether it's 5,000 or
6,000, but the type of threat that they pose,'' he said. ``If they
make it hard for people to live (in northern Israel), we will have
to make some kind of decision about an operation.''
   Other commanders also referred to the Palestinian threat and
said that in the past three months, 29 guerrillas were killed in 10
attempts to infiltrate Israel.
   Israeli sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested
that a successful Palestinian attack on civilians across the border
could prompt Israel's army to launch a ground operation to uproot
the Palestinians in the Tyre area, 14 miles north of the border.
   Capt. Avi Hai, an Israeli officer who briefed the journalists,
also warned of possible retaliation by Israel's army.
   ``The IDF (Israel Defense Force) will hit and hit hard
Palestinian centers if these centers will turn into a threat to the
northern border,'' he said.
   Israel invaded south Lebanon in 1978 to drive out Palestine
Liberation Organization guerrillas and in 1982 staged a major
invasion north to Beirut to force PLO chief Yasser Arafat from his
power base in Lebanon.
   The 1982 war in Lebanon led to a three-year occupation of the
Lebanese south, which ended in 1985 with Israel creating the six-to
10-mile zone to protect its northern settlements.
   Tuesday's tour of the region was the first such army-sponsored
trip in more than six months. Reporters traveled in four trucks
guarded by two armored personnel carriers, four jeeps and a
truckload of soldiers.
   At Ras Al-Bayada, the entrance to the security zone on the coast
six miles from the border, Israeli officials displayed the weapons
carried by the two guerrillas captured Tuesday near the town of
Bint Jbail.
   Included were two U.S.-made anti-tank weapons, two Soviet-made
AK-47 assault rifles, nine clips of ammunition and three hand
grenades.
   Israel radio said one of the captured guerrillas was a member of
Arafat's Fatah PLO faction and the other belonged to the
Syrian-based Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   On a mountain ridgeline west of Ras Al-Bayada, an Israeli
officer identified only as Lt. Col. Udi pointed out the sprawling
Rashadiya refugee camp near Tyre, where he said many Palestinian
guerrillas were hiding.
   He said the guerrillas lacked the long-range artillery needed to
strike either the security zone or Israel itself. Israel's northern
army commander, Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, said only one rocket attack
against Israel had been reported so far this year, compared to 26
last year and 80 in 1986.
   The largest weapons the guerrillas have are 107mm Katyusha
rockets and 60mm heavy mortars, neither of which could span the six
miles separating his outpost from the guerrilla camp, Udi said.
   ``In order for them to strike us, they would have to advance out
of their camps,'' said Udi, standing behind a coil of barbed wire
at the edge of a deep, jagged ravine that provided a natural
barrier to any attack.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Share prices closed at another record high on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange today, while the dollar continued to rise
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 793.96 points
Tuesday in its largest single-day rise this year, added another
430.92 points, or 1.3 percent, finishing the day at 32,737.28.
   Buying interest remained strong mainly because of the beginning
Tuesday of the new Japanese business year, said an analyst with
Nomura Securities in Tokyo. ``Japanese investors still expect the
Nikkei to rise higher, which also boosted buying,'' the analyst
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Trading was active, with volume on the market's first section
estimated at 1.3 billion shares, up from Tuesday's 1.2 billion.
Among the gainers were steels and chemicals.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 133.25 yen,
up 0.35 yen from Tueday's 132.90-yen finish. The U.S. currency
ranged between 133.10 a0 yen during the day.
   After opening at 133.llar then began edging down
in late morning trading because of it-taking, a trader with
Mitsubishi Bank said.ipants stayed on the sidelines in the afternoon
following a comment from Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita that
dollar-buyad been ``overdone,'' said the trader, who askeddentified by
name.
   Speaking at a regular news conference, Sita said the central
bank would intervene jointly with other countries if necessary to
discourage a further rise by the dollarnst the yen.
   The Mitsubishi Bank trader saiis unlikely to
continue its rise because a wait-and-see mood was growing in the
market and slowing down the dollar-buying.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's leading young chess player
and his father have met with an FBI official and asked for
political asylum, according to a grandmaster and fellow Soviet
defector who aided them.
   Gata Kamsky, 14, and his father, Rustam Kamsky, sought asylum
Tuesday and were staying in the New York area, said Grandmaster Lev
Alburt, a former U.S. chess champion who defected from the Soviet
Union a decade ears ago.
   World champion Garri Kasparov and other experts have said Kamsky
is likely to reach the highest echelons of world chess.
   ``America finally has a potential super-grandmaster, who, five
years from now, could challenge for the world championship,'' said
Larry Parr, a former editor of Chess Life and Review.
   Gata Kamsky was the youngest member of a prominent Soviet chess
delegation participating in the New York Open tournament, which
ended Tuesday.
   ``His decision was made, in my judgment, even before he came
here,'' Alburt said. ``It was finalized while he was here. When I
learned about his plans I called the Jamestown Foundation in
Washington and they brought me in touch with a person in the FBI in
New York. He interviewed them before the game and offered
protection.''
   After speaking with the FBI official, Kamsky, who tied for first
place in the championship of Leningrad two years ago, went on to
beat Patrick Wolff, an American international master, in the final
round.
   Alburt, 43, said the other Soviet players at the tournament were
unaware the Kamskys were about to defect.
   The Jamestown Foundation, founded in 1983, promotes high-level
defections from the Soviet Union and provides career counseling and
other help to defectors. Alburt said it had helped with the
defection of Arkady Shevchenko, the former Soviet representative at
the United Nations.
   The chief of the Soviet delegation, Alexander Roschal, a
prominent chess journalist, was not at the tournament site when the
news broke.
   A member of the delegation said on condition of anonymity that
Kamsky had always been treated well by the Soviet sports
authorities.
   ``I can't understand why his father did this,'' the Soviet said.
   Alburt said Kamsky's parents were divorced, and his father had
remarried. They hoped the elder Kamsky's second wife would
eventually gain permission to join them in the United States, he
said.
   Since the formation of the international chess federation in
1948 and the creation of the modern world championship, seven of
the eight titleholders have been Soviet. The exception was American
Bobby Fischer, who became champion in 1972 but refused to defend
his title in 1975 and has never competed since.
   Kamsky joins a celebrated list of leading Soviet and East
European chess players who have defected to the West.
   They include Viktor Korchnoi, a former world championship
finalist who lives in and plays for Switzerland; Alburt; and
International Master Igor Ivanov, Canada's second-ranked player.
   In August, Romania's top player, Grandmaster Mihai Suba, was
granted political asylum in London during a competition. He
competed in New York with a Union Jack by his board.
   Other leading Soviet players have emigrated legally or left in
other ways.
   Former world champion Boris Spassky, who lost his championship
crown to Fischer, married a Moscow-based French diplomat and now
represents that country.
   In November in Salonica, Greece, Elena Akhmylovskaya, the Soviet
Union's second highest ranked woman player, eloped with the captain
of the American men's team, John Donaldson, and now lives with him
in Seattle.
   The $165,000 New York Open is widely considered America's
premier international chess event.
   John Fedorowicz of New York won the $18,000 first prize in the
top section, which included 45 grandmasters and Judit Polgar of
Hungary, the highest ranked 12-year-old in history. Miss Polgar,
also widely tapped as a future champion, finished a half point
ahead of Kamsky and defeated him in their individual game.

<HEAD>Law Officials Warn of Sharp Rise in Crime</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's leading law officials today drew a bleak
picture of a nation beset by rising violent crime, rampant
profiteering in scarce goods, official corruption and increased
juvenile delinquency.
   In annual reports to the National People's Congress, China's
legislature, the officials also acknowledged thousands of instances
where false confessions were extracted through torture or frameups.
   Ren Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, said
Chinese courts sentenced 368,790 people last year, 13 percent more
than 1987.
   In sharp contrast, courts acquitted just 2,039 defendants.
   Ren said 113,533 convicted offenders were sentenced to death or
prison terms of five years to life. He said 101 embezzlers and
bribe-takers were sentenced to death or life in prison.
   China does not give specific figures for executions, although
the number is believed to be well over 1,000 a year.
   Ren said murder cases in 1988 were up 9.1 percent, robbery cases
43.1 percent and cases of serious larceny 63.8 percent. He did not
give a breakdown of the crimes.
   ``While public order is generally stable across the country,
many problems and unstable factors still remain,'' he said. He
called for ``heavy blows'' against those who ``gravely jeopardize
public order.''
   Despite harsh punishments, China has been plagued by a crime
wave in recent years resulting from greater social mobility, less
government controls over people's lives and growing income
disparities as the nation switches to a market-oriented economy.
   Liu Fuzhi, the country's chief prosecutor, said his offices
arrested 8,777 on charges of corruption and handled 40,000 cases of
infringement of people's rights by government officials or law
enforcement officers, a rise of 7.8 percent from 1987.
   Among these, there were 4,700 cases where police were guilty of
extortion, torture, frameups and unlawful detentions. Liu said 227
cases led to disability and death.
   Ren also said youths between the ages of 14 and 18 accounted for
8.9 percent of convicted offenders in 1988, up 13.8 percent.
   He said there were 74,923 convictions for economic offenses such
as profiteering in scarce or price-controlled goods, hoarding
scarce commodities and reselling prized imports like autos and
stereos for big profits.

<DATELINE>BRASELTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actress Kim Basinger has purchased
Braselton from the family that founded it in 1876, and a real
estate broker said she might establish a movie production company
in the tiny northeast Georgia town.
   Herbert B. Braselton Sr. said Tuesday that his family agreed to
sell 1,800 acres of property _ including the town's industrial
park, shopping center and bank _ for $20 million to Miss Basinger,
a native of nearby Hart County.
   The deal's closing will come later this year, Braselton said.
   ``I've worked with Kim on this for quite some time, about 18
months,'' said Charles Morris, the Braselton real estate broker who
handled the deal.
   Morris said Miss Basinger has expressed an interest in
developing Braselton into a tourist center, and possibly
establishing a movie production company.
   Attempts to contact Miss Basinger and her representatives were
unsuccessful Tuesday.
   Braselton, a town of 500 people about 40 miles north of Atlanta,
has been virtually controlled by the Braselton family since William
Harrison Braselton founded it in 1876.
   The property first was offered for sale five years ago for $14
million. But the price jumped after Chateau Elan winery and a
Mitsubishi plant located in the area.
   ``We're relieved we found somebody we think will do good for the
community,'' Herbert Braselton said. ``There were tears shed this
morning, when we told the employees. We hate to divest ourselves of
a longtime loved entity, but it has to happen. We've all gotten
old, and it's time for younger people to take over.''
   He said the family wanted to sell because most of the Braseltons
are elderly and none of the younger family members wanted to hold
onto the land.
   But they had turned down numerous offers for the town, he said.
   ``The primary difficulty was the terms,'' Braselton said.
``People wanted 40 years (to pay). To people in their 70s and 80s,
that doesn't interest them. We got a cash deal.''
   The 34-year-old Miss Basinger grew up in Athens but left at age
17 for New York City to become a model. From there, she went into
acting, starring in such movies as ``The Natural,'' and ``9{
Weeks.'' She also stars in the soon-to-be-released film ``Batman.''

<HEAD>Judge Upholds Stabbing Victim's Right To Die; Assailant Will Not
Appeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An assailant who tried to have his victim
kept alive on a life-support system said he will not appeal a
judge's decision rejecting his request, even though he may face a
murder charge as a result.
   Noel Pagan of Wellesley, Mass., wanted to prevent Mark Weaver's
mother from removing the feeding tube that has kept Weaver alive
since a 1985 stabbing in Lewiston. Pagan, 29, served three years in
prison for aggravated assault but still could face a murder charge
when Weaver dies.
   Probate Court Judge Dana Childs ruled Tuesday that Pagan could
not intervene in the case because his interest in preventing
Weaver's death has nothing to do with the family's request that
Weaver die peacefully.
   ``Mr. Pagan's only claim to being an interested party stems from
the possibility that when Mark Weaver suffers death following the
withdrawal of treatment, Pagan may be charged with Mark Weaver's
murder,'' the judge wrote.
   Weaver's mother, Sylvia Lane, said she would proceed with plans
to remove the feeding tube Thursday.
   Weaver, 26, has been kept alive with the tube for nearly four
years since his stab wounds left him in a vegetative state.
   Lane said she was pleased with the judge's decision Tuesday
because it was her son's wish that he not be kept alive
artificially.
   ``I don't see how he (Pagan) had any right to decide what
happens to his victim,'' she said.
   Pagan's attorney, Robert Mullen, said he had told his client
that an appeal would mean the case ``would drag out for months, and
I couldn't tell him when it was going to stop.''
   He said Pagan had agreed that it was in nobody's interest to
appeal the ruling.
   The attorney general's office said it will not decide whether to
file charges until after the death.
   ``Until there's a death, there's no cause of death,'' spokesman
David Cheever said Tuesday.
   State Deputy Attorney General Fernand LaRochelle said Monday
that Pagan could be charged with murder if Weaver dies because it
would not be the same crime as assault. The Constitution protects
defendants from being prosecuted twice for the same offense.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar was steady in European trading
early today ahead of the release of U.S. leading economic
indicators for February. Gold prices were lower.
   The market was apparently cautious about the possibility of
central bank intervention after the banks' aggressive actions
Tuesday, dealers said.
   Yet central banks also appeared to be waiting for the 2:30 p.m.
release of the U.S. economic data, dealers said. Central banks
wouldn't want to use their reserves to push down the dollar if a
bearish leading indicator had the same effect for them, they said.
   In London, the dollar rose against the pound. One British pound
cost $l.6905 dollars today, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's
$1.7030.
   Other midmorning rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Tuesday's late rates:
   _1.8922 West German marks, up from 1.8850
   _1.6515 Swiss francs, up from 1.6415
   _6.3910 French francs, up from 6.3625
   _2.1330 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1215
   _1,386.25 Italian lire, up from 1,379.50
   _1.1943 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1925
   Earlier in Tokyo the dollar closed at 133.25 Japanese yen, up
0.35 yen. In London, the dollar traded lower at 133.10.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $383.35, down from late
Tuesday's $387.50. At midmorning, the city's bullion dealers fixed
a recommended price of $383.30.
   In Zurich, the bid price for gold was $383.50 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's late $388.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold dropped $7.65 to close at a $384.99 a
troy ounce.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid $5.83 a troy ounce,
down from $5.91 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>World War II Vet Faces Charges For Painting Over Swastika Grafitti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNION CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A World War II veteran who got tired of
waiting for housing officials to clean away swastika grafitti in
his building has been charged with criminal mischief for painting
over the symbols, police said today.
   Jack Stahl, a 25-year resident of the Hillside housing project,
said he made complaints for seven months about the grafitti to the
city's Housing Authority. But he said nothing was done to remove or
cover the swastikas.
   A police official said today the charge was lodged against Stahl
in December by the housing agency and that Stahl was due in
Municipal Court on Thursday.
   If convicted, he could be sentenced to a maximum six months in
prison and a $1,000 fine, the New York Daily News reported today.
   Stahl, a 59-year-old truck dispatcher, said he decided to paint
over the Nazi symbols himself because he was touched by the
reaction of an elderly Jewish resident to seeing a swastika in an
elevator.
   ``I said, `Why are you crying?''' Stahl said.
   ``She pointed to the swastika and said a relative of hers had
died in the Holocaust. I could see how she hurt,'' said Stahl, who
according to the newspaper is not Jewish.
   ``Enough is enough. After being yessed to death by Housing
Authority officials who promised to take care of the problem for
seven months, I decided I had to take the matter into my own
hands,'' he said.
   Stahl said that about 20 minutes after painting over swastikas
in the elevator and in an eighth floor hallway, someone slipped a
notice under his door ordering him to report to the Housing
Authority office.
   He said he was met there by by Virgilio Cabello, the Housing
Authority director, who told him he would face charges.
   Cabello's secretary told the newspaper he had no comment.

<HEAD>Medical Manufacturer Agrees To Pay $764,000 In Penalties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A medical equipment manufacturer has pleaded guilty
to criminal charges of selling thousands of defective pacemakers
and corrosive batteries and has agreed to pay $764,000 in penalties.
   Cordis Corp., which last week agreed to pay $5 million to settle
a separate civil-fraud claim brought by the government, pleaded
guilty Tuesday to 12 felony counts and 13 misdemeanors in the
second case.
   Four executives of the Miami-based concern still face a criminal
trial set for September over the defective pacemakers.
   Cordis, which sold its pacemaker division in 1987, was accused
of distributing 2,200 faulty pacemakers and 6,000 batteries prone
to corrosion between December 1983 and October 1985.
   Charges filed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration claimed
the pacemakers, which are planted under the skin to regulate
heartbeat, could stop without warning. But no reports of medical
emergencies are known because of the Cordis devices.
   Negotiations for the plea began last year between the Justice
Department and Cordis. A first accord between the two sides was
rejected last October by U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus.
   The company's offer to plead guilty to 24 counts and pay
$264,000 in fines and costs was insufficient, Marcus said at the
time.
   But Marcus accepted the new deal, which included another felony
charge _ with a $500,000 penalty for intent to defraud the FDA by
failing to provide required notice of the devices' adverse field
reports.
   Sentencing in the criminal case against Cordis was set for April
25. Marcus is not bound by the restrictions of the plea agreement.
   The $5 million settlement the company agreed to last week came
in a civil claim by the Veterans Administration. The VA sought
reimbursement for an undisclosed number of the defective pacemakers
it had bought.
   The Justice Department said Tuesday's civil settlement was one
of the largest Medicare recoveries ever.
   According to Cordis lawyer Daniel G. Hall, the company had paid
$1 million towards its settlement before Tuesday's agreement. He
said the remaining penalty plus interest would be paid within three
years.
   Cordis sold its pacemaker business to the Australian medical
device manufacturer Telectronics. Cordis now concentrates on making
catheters for diagnosing and treating heart problems and gauges for
monitoring pressure on the brain.
   The company reported net losses of $56.1 million in 1987, but a
major restructuring after the sale of the pacemaker operation
brought the company net earnings for 1988 of $2.4 million from
sales of $132 million.

<HEAD>Tornadoes Strike Texas; Thunderstorms Hit Across Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A severe thunderstorm system churned up several tornadoes and
prompted flooding, high winds and golf ball-size hail across much
of eastern Texas, while rain and thunderstorms hit many other areas
of the nation.
   At least eight tornadoes touched down in eastern Texas, and
rising waters in Rusk and Cherokee counties southeast of Dallas
prompted officials to close roads and evacuate at least two
apartment complexes, and officers rescued stranded motorists in
low-lying areas.
   ``This is the worst I've ever seen in my whole life and I've
been here a long time,'' said Ruby Taylor, dispatcher at the
Cherokee County Sheriff's office.
   Flood waters on a part of U.S. Highway 69 were as deep as 5 feet
Tuesday evening, sending motorists scurrying to the roofs of their
cars and into nearby trees, Ms. Taylor said.
   Downtown Jacksonville had received more than 7 inches of rain
during that time, while the Cherokee County Airport reported 8.2
inches of rain.
   No injuries or major damage from the storms were reported.
   Showers and thunderstorms also hit the lower Mississippi Valley,
western Tennessee, the Ohio Valley, western Pennsylvania, New York
state and the northern two-thirds of New England.
   Rain was scattered along the northern Pacific Coast into the
Pacific Northwest. Snow fell from south-central Montana across
western Wyoming and from northeast Minnesota across upper Michigan.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms along a
cold front reaching from the southern and central Appalachians to
central Texas, central Oklahoma and eastern Kansas; possibly severe
thunderstorms from eastern Texas and the central Gulf Coast to the
lower Ohio Valley and the middle Mississippi Valley; rain from the
upper Ohio Valley to New England and from the Dakotas across the
northern and central Rockies to the northern Pacific Coast; and
generally cloudy skies over the upper Mississippi Valley and the
Great Lakes.
   Predicted highs: upper 30s and low 40s from eastern North Dakota
across upper Michigan to northern New England; upper 40s and the
50s from the northern Pacific Coast across the northern two-thirds
of the Rockies and the rest of the Great Lakes; 70s and lower 80s
from Southern California across the southern Plains to the southern
and middle Atlantic Coast; and 60s elsewhere.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 9
degrees at Marquette, Mich., to 76 in Florida at Fort Lauderdale,
Homestead and Key West.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's dismissal
of his designated successor and the resignation of two key Foreign
Ministry officials indicates a resurgence of radical fundamentalism
in the Islamic republic.
   The removal of Ayatollah Hussein Ali Montazeri leaves open who
will succeed Khomeini, now 88 and ailing, when he dies.
   By dumping the 64-year-old Montazeri as his political and
religious heir, Khomeini has moved to curb so-called liberal
figures in the Tehran hierarchy and strengthen the hand of
hardliners led by Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi.
   The political future of Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani,
leader of the so-called pragmatists, is also now in question.
   Montazeri, who has in recent weeks openly criticized the
shortcomings of the Islamic revolution and called for greater
freedoms, announced his resignation Tuesday after Khomeini asked
him to step down.
   He wrote to Khomeini: ``The survival and stability of the
Islamic republic rests on obeying your orders.''
   Montazeri's removal, and the resignations of deputy Foreign
Minister Mohammad Javad Larijani and U.N. Ambassador Mohammad
Jaafar Mahallati in recent days, took place against the backdrop of
a determined drive by Khomeini to swing Iran back to radical
fundamentalism.
   He has sought to revitalize flagging revolutionary fervor in
post-war Iran by confronting the West over Salman Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   Khomeini's actions also served the purpose of seriously damaging
efforts by Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to
rebuild bridges with the West and end Iran's isolation.
   These events have dealt a serious blow to efforts to ease Iran's
political, religious and social restrictions following the Aug. 20
cease-fire in the costly eight-year war with Iraq.
   It also effectively robs the liberal faction of one of its most
influential figures.
   Montazeri has recently been aligning with Mehdi Bazargan, leader
of the Freedom Movement, Iran's token opposition which has been
largely stifled for several years.
   Bazargan, the republic's first prime minister who resigned over
the takeover of the U.S. embassy in November 1979, has said that
under moves to permit political parties he plans to expand his tiny
movement nationwide and even field a candidate in the presidential
race ``if circumstances permit.''
   There has long been speculation that Iran would likely be ruled
by a triumverate of key leaders, including Rafsanjani, after
Khomeini dies, with Montazeri little more than a figurehead.
   Eighteen months ago, Khomeini rewrote his political will, to be
opened after his death, heightening speculation he sought to
diminish Montazeri's powers in the succession.
   Montazeri's recent criticism of the revolution's achievements
while the country celebrated the republic's first decade _ the late
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted in 1979 _ came amid an
intensifying power struggle between Rafsanjani and the hardliners.
   Montazeri initially rejected Khomeini's order that Moslems seek
out and kill Rushdie, but later came out in support the religious
decree.
   Khomeini, apparently at Rafsanjani's urging, unconditionally
accepted a July 1987 U.N. Security Council cease-fire resolution
after wavering for almost a year.
   Ending the war was a major boost for Rafsanjani and his allies.
   Khomeini proclaimed his death sentence on Rushdie Feb. 14, the
day after Rafsanjani announced he would run in the presidential
elections, a move the hardliners saw as a bid by the speaker for
supreme power in the post-Khomeini era.
   Whether coincidence or not, Khomeini's action was a serious blow
to Rafsanjani.
   President Ali Khamenei's second four-year term expires in
September. Under the constitution he cannot run for a third term.

   Fishermen sporting black armbands told
oil industry, federal and state officials that they fear their
livelihood _ the Prince William Sound fishery _ may be imperiled by
the nation's largest oil spill.
   John Booren, who fishes in the sound, said fishermen know this
year's catch will fetch little money, even if oil damage is
contained.
   Just the publicity will destroy the market for the area's fish,
he said.
   A high school gymnasium, which is the largest meeting place in
this town of 2,500, was packed Tuesday night as fishermen, many
with families in tow, voiced their anger and apprehensions.
   ``Some of the old-timers tell me this is the biggest crowd
they've seen here since the town turned out to protest the
pipeline,'' City Manager Don Moore said.
   The town opposed construction of the 800-mile trans-Alaska oil
pipeline in the 1970s, Moore said.
   He spoke in a hallway as a state fish and game official offered
yet more bad news on the spread of oil from a grounded tanker that
leaked 240,000 barrels of crude into the sea Friday 25 miles from
Port Valdez. Cordova is about 50 miles to the southeast.
   Moore said many fishermen are bitter because their initial
offers to help contain the spill went unanswered.
   He said Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which has the
responsibility for immediate response to oil spills in the sound,
had issued emergency telephone numbers prior to the spill.
   When our fishermen called to offer assistance, nobody would
answer the phone at Alyeska, he said. The company has said some
employees were off in observance of Good Friday the day of the
spill.
   The fishermen now are taking the lead in trying to protect
sensitive areas, including three fish hatcheries on islands in the
sound.
   ``I want you to know that we are not going to be able to stop
much of the damage,'' said Dennis Kelso, the state commissioner of
environmental conservation. ``This is a very serious spill and a
very environmentally complex area.''
   Alyeska President George Nelson and Exxon spokesman Don Cornett
were treated with relative restraint by the crowd.
   ``What's your way of life worth to you?'' a woman shouted at
Cornett.
   ``Not very much tonight,'' he replied.
   Cornett said he would not try to duck legitimate damage claims
filed by fishermen hurt by the spill.
   Steve Zimmermann of the National Marine Fisheries Service said
many sea otters will suffer from the spill, but that news was
greeted with applause.
   Fishermen have complained the otter population has reached an
intolerable level. They say the animals eat fish otherwise
available for harvest by the fishing fleet. So they expressed
pleasure when Zimmerman said:
   ``Some of them are going to go to sea otter heaven in the next
few days.''

<HEAD>Egg Experiment On Recent Shuttle Mission Raised Many Questions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A fertilized egg experiment aboard
the recent Discovery flight raised more questions than it answered
after half of them returned dead, the shuttle's pilot says.
   The experiment included 16 chicken eggs fertilized two days
before the March 13 blastoff and another 16 fertilized nine days
prior to launch.
   Although all of the older eggs hatched Saturday, the others were
found dead when the shuttle returned March 18. Both the hatched
chicks and the dead ones are being studied to determine how
weightlessness affected them.
   ``What looked like a very simple experiment may turn out to have
generated thousands of questions now instead of providing any
answers to anything,'' Discovery pilot John Blaha said Tuesday at a
news conference. ``It's certainly a great mystery as to why this
happened.''
   Dr. James Bagian, another astronaut on the flight, said the
experiment raised questions as to whether plant or animal life can
begin in zero gravity.
   Bagian said the chicken eggs and another experiment in which he
observed plant growth were designed to determine if cell division
is somehow ``impeded or mutated'' by a lack of gravity.
   ``Is there a certain point in the differentiation of cell types
where they are vulnerable to the effects of the loss of gravity?
Maybe gravity plays up to now an unknown role but a very essential
role in that the older ones (eggs), at nine days, are past that
crucial gate, if you will, and they are developing normally,''
Bagian said.
   If the experiment shows that ``life cannot begin anew in
orbit,'' that would have great implications for long space stays in
the future, Bagian said.
   ``You may have to supply a gravity environment for a period of
time.''
   During the flight, the crew _ which also consisted of commander
Michael Coats and astronauts James F. Buchli and Robert Springer _
took 3,000 still photographs and shot nearly three miles of movie
film in an effort to document environmentally damaged areas of the
Earth.
   On Tuesday, the crew showed several spectacular views they
captured, including shots of a sunset, Sri Lanka, the Caribbean Sea
and the Himalayas. But they also talked about how deforestation,
air and water pollution and the effects of droughts can be observed
from space.
   ``I think all of us that have flown come back with a very
protective feeling about our planet,'' said Coats. ``All of us come
back, I think, with a renewed appreciation of the fact that we've
got to protect this planet, there's no place else to go.''

   Diners atop a 26-story hotel were ruffled
by the sight of a predator munching pigeons outside the window, but
managers applauded their guest's good taste after discovering its
pedigree.
   ``We thought it was a hawk,'' Sheraton Tacoma Hotel sales
director Barbara Faulkner said of the bird who liked to bring its
own lunch up to the restaurant windowsill.
   After a number of complaints, hotel managers called the Point
Defiance Zoo to find out how to get rid of the messy eater. But
when they found out it was a rare peregrine falcon, an endangered
species protected by the federal government, they offered it the
best perch in the house.
   On Monday, the hotel issued a news release proudly announcing
the falcon's choice of Tacoma accommodations, suggesting it was
attracted by the hotel's ``unobstructed view of the city and Mount
Rainier.''
   John Houck, curator of mammals and birds at Point Defiance, said
the falcon probably regards the hotel as a convenient cliff.
   ``He's bopping the pigeons along the railroad yards,'' Houck
said. ``There's a lot of pigeons down there, and it's pretty easy
to make a living, picking them off and taking them back to the
ledges of the Sheraton to eat.''
   The Audubon Society says tall buildings and easy pigeon pickings
attract a number of the birds to city life.
   The bird has deserted the restaurant window ledge for the top of
the big red ``S'' on the side of the hotel, but Ms. Faulkner says
the staff wants it to stick around.
   ``He really has very good taste,'' she said.

<HEAD>Pravda Calls Vote A Victory For Reform Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda today called
the parliamentary elections in which party leaders lost in the
Soviet Union's three largest cities a victory for reform efforts.
   ``Voters did not simply vote, like it was earlier, but they
really made a choice, giving their preference to candidates whose
pre-election platforms suited them better,'' Pravda said.
``Choosing people's deputies, the country voted for perestroika.''
   While official results of Sunday's balloting for 1,500 seats in
the Congress of People's Deputies parliament will not be released
for days, party and government officials in Moscow, Leningrad and
Kiev were voted out by a frustrated public, as were at least 37
local officials around the country.
   One loser was Yuri Solovyev, a non-voting member of the ruling
Politburo who was running unopposed in Leningrad.
   The losses could actually benefit Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev because the balloting emphasizes voters' frustrations
with their local party leadership and desires for further reforms.
   There were notable winners, including Telman Gdlyan, a federal
investigator who headed the embezzlement and corruption cases
against officials in the Soviet Central Asian republic of
Uzbekistan, the official news agency Tass said today.
   Gdlyan's platform included a toughening of the Soviet Union's
criminal codes, Tass reported. Gdlyan captured 87 percent of the
vote in a race against four other candidates, the news agency said.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a
news briefing Tuesday that the losses could not be considered a
defeat for the Communist Party because about 80 percent of party
members won their races.
   But he said local party organizations would have to review why
party members lost.
   Reports from the Byelorussian capital Minsk and from Armenia,
two areas where there has been tension over citizens' demands for
reform, indicated voters rejected top leaders or just stayed away
from the polls.
   Pravda said the city party leader in Minsk, V. Galko, and a
first deputy premier of the republic, Y. Khusainov, failed their
election bids. Voters also rejected Communist Party leaders of the
Gomel and Mogilev regions _ two southern areas affected by the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear disaster.
   Many citizens of Minsk were angered last fall by tough police
action against groups seeking to build a memorial to the victims of
Stalin's purges and a nascent People's Front grassroots
organization.
   In Armenia, voters stayed away from the polls to voice their
frustration with a lack of choice, the government newspaper
Izvestia said Tuesday.
   ``At the very climax of the campaign people asked a question for
which they did not receive a convincing answer,'' Izvestia said.
``Why did a group of leaders of the republic, nominated as
candidates, have no opponents? And many, as a sign of protest,
refused to take part in elections without a choice.''
   In many parts of the Soviet Union, 85-95 percent of the voters
participated, but in Armenia the figure was 72 percent. And only 53
percent of the voters of the earthquake-devastated capital Yerevan
went to the polls.
   Armenia has been the site of frequent turmoil since February
1988 when a dispute arose with neighboring Azerbaijan over control
of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

   A Syrian shell struck U.S. Ambassador
John McCarthy's residence while he was in its bomb shelter,
damaging the living quarters but causing no casualties, the
American Embassy said today.
   ``Damage was confined to the living and dining areas and no one
was injured in the attack,'' an embassy statement said.
   An embassy spokeswoman said the attack occurred late Tuesday and
that McCarthy was in the bomb shelter. The residence in the
Christian Yarze district is midway between the presidential palace
and the defense ministry.
   Meanwhile, a cease-fire declared today by Christian army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun after three weeks of fierce artillery
clashes with Syrian troops and their Moslem militia allies
collapsed a few hours later.
   A police spokesman said one man was killed and four wounded in a
Syrian rocket barrage of Christian east Beirut earlier in the day.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 122 people killed and
376 wounded since March 8, when Beirut's worst civil war clashes in
four years broke out.
   Aoun's headquarters said Syrian gunners were shelling the
presidential palace, the Defense Ministry and neighboring
residential districts in Christian east Beirut.
   Aoun, who heads a Christian military cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, said he ordered his 20,000 troops to stop shooting at
midnight in response to an appeal from the Arab League.
   There was no public response from the Syrian command or Druse
warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia,
Aoun's main adversaries in the latest round of Lebanon's 14-year
civil war between Christians and Moslems.
   A communique issued by Aoun's headquarters said, ``Despite the
army's adherence to the cease-fire ... the Syrian batteries poured
shells on eastern (Christian) areas as people were emerging from
bomb shelters to buy food and take stock of the damage caused to
their homes.''
   The communique said that Aoun's troops were not returning fire.
However, sniper fire from positions in east Beirut hit several
streets in both Moslem and Christian sectors.
   The shellings have triggered an exodus of residents from Moslem
west Beirut and its southern Shiite Moslem slums. Long lines of
cars packed with beds, mattresses and suitcases continued to stream
from the city's Moslem sector heading south.
   United Nations sources said at least 35,000 Moslem families have
sought refuge with relatives and friends in areas policed by U.N.
peacekeeping forces in south Lebanon.
   The confrontation was sparked when Aoun clamped a blockade March
6 on illegal ports operated by Moslem militias along Lebanon's
Mediterranean coastline. The ports were draining about $100 million
a year from the five government harbors in lost tax revenues.
   In retaliation, Jumblatt, Maj. Gen. Samit Khatib's 22,000-strong
Moslem army and the Syrians besieged the 310-square-mile enclave
where about 1 million Christians live.
   Syria, the main powerbroker in Lebanon, keeps about 40,000
troops in the country under a 1976 Arab League mandate to end the
civil war.
   Israel, which maintains a self-designated security zone in south
Lebanon, has pledged not to interfere in the Beirut fighting.

   Thousands of radicals battled riot
police with firebombs and rocks today following rallies in support
of a top dissident's visit to communist North Korea to discuss
reunification.
   Hundreds of riot police fired tear gas and hurled rocks to drive
back the protesters in the southern cities of Taegu and Kwangju
where dissident groups rallied in support of Moon Ik-hwan's visit,
police and witnesses said.
   The South Korean government has said Moon will be prosecuted if
he returns to the south. His visit has sparked major controversy in
South Korea, with the government charging that dissidents are
trying to undermine its authority.
   Students gathered at Chonam University in Kwangju to denounce
President Roh Tae-woo's government and demand unification. Yonhap,
the South Korean news agency, said about 5,000 students took part
in the protest.
   Police opened fire with tear gas when the protesters attempted
to march into the streets.
   About 5,000 radical students and workers attended a rally at
Kyemyong University in Taegu, where dissident leader Paek Ki-wan
said Moon went to North Korea to speak for farmers, workers and the
poor.
   He said the Roh government was not interested in unification.
   Aboput 2,000 protesters then attempted to march into the streets
and clashed with riot police blocking the way, police said.
   Police in Taegu and Kwangju said they had no immediate reports
of arrests or serious injuries.
   In Jinju on the southern coast, about 800 students clashed with
police in another anti-government protest, but officials said the
demonstration was not linked to Moon's visit.
   The protest came as South Korean leaders, angered by Moon's
visit, were reconsidering efforts to improve relations with the
north. Officials have charged the north is trying to undermine the
Seoul government by having independent contacts with South Korean
dissidents.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and other government leaders met
and agreed to take a ``cautious stand'' in future detente with
North Korea, a government official said, requesting anonymity.
   Yonhap quoted a ``highly-placed'' government source as saying
President Roh Tae-woo is considering a cabinet reshuffle to hold
security officials responsible for failing to stop the visit.
   Moon met North Korean President Kim Il Sung Monday in Pyongyang,
the communist capital.
   Officials in Seoul say he will be arrested when he returns
because he violated South Korean law, which forbids unauthorized
contact with North Korea.
   In a related development, newspapers in Seoul reported today
that the government may call off a scheduled visit to North Korea
by Chung Ju-yung, founder of one of South Korea's largest business
conglomerates, the Hyundai Group.
   Chung was to visit Pyongyang in April for talks on joint
ventures with the north, which include a resort development in
North Korea's Diamond Mountains on the east coast. He visited
Pyongyang in January.
   Both South and North Korean governments approved the visit.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anomymity, said
South Korea would continue efforts to ease tension on the Korean
peninsula and maintain limited contact with the north, but
officials were reviewing the impact of Moon's trip on the
inter-Korea dialogue.
   Roh's government has been trying to improve relations with the
north to ease tension on the peninsula and broaden its trade with
other communist nations.
   The two Koreas technically are still at war nearly four decades
after the Korean War ended, with their border sealed, although
there have been government-level talks on and off since the early
1970s.

   Voter rejection of a tax increase to pay for a
vast expansion of the area's mass transit system will lead only to
a worsening of the city's air pollution and traffic congestion,
disappointed supporters say.
   ``I'd say get ready for Los Angeles,'' said campaign coordinator
Bill Meek.
   Voters in Maricopa County on Tuesday rejected a proposed
half-cent sales tax increase by 224,309 votes, or 61 percent, to
143,622 votes, or 39 percent. Approval would have raised the sales
tax in most of the county to 7 percent.
   The 30-year tax increase would have paid for an $8.4 billion
system dubbed ValTrans that had been hailed by some as the
metropolitan area's salvation from traffic jams and smog and
condemned by others as a waste of money.
   The project called for a 103-mile elevated railway, 23 miles of
rush-hour train service, freeway lanes for multiple-passenger
vehicles and expansion of the bus system from 350 buses to 1,500.
   ``Obviously this train is not leaving the station,'' said Mayor
Terry Goddard.
   The Regional Public Transportation Authority had projected a
$44-per-year cost to the average household, but a study by the
Arizona Tax Research Associations put the cost at $82 to $107.
   Politicians leading the drive ``have lost credibility and touch
with their constituents,'' said Tom Smith, a founder of Voters
Against Senseless Transit.
   ValTrans was also pushed as a way to cut auto-insurance rates
and allow families to get rid of second or third cars.
   But opponents said that the Phoenix area is too spread out for
mass transit and that construction of freeways should have priority.
   Goddard called the defeat of the project a major setback but
said voters turned down the specific proposal and not mass transit
in general. He said air pollution and traffic still have to be
confronted.
   ``We're going to have a couple, three more years where we're
falling behind in terms of dealing with these problems,'' he said.

   NASA has agreed to back loans of up to $92
million to build a factory to produce a critical rocket fuel
ingredient that has been in short supply since an explosion leveled
the manufacturer's plant last May.
   NASA and Pacific Engineering and Production Co. said Tuesday the
agreement will pay for an ammonium perchlorate plant under
construction near Cedar City, Utah.
   The agreement came a month after a shipment of the fuel oxidizer
made by PEPCON was seized aboard a ship bound for Iran. NASA,
however, said the space agency had no information to suggest the
company knew the shipment was headed to Iran.
   The loan actually is being provided by a bank, but NASA and the
Department of Defense are, in essence, guaranteeing it by agreeing
to purchase at least 20 million pounds of ammonium perchlorate a
year for the next seven years.
   The government stepped forward to help secure the loan because
the 1988 blast at the company's plant in Henderson, Nev., left only
one U.S. supplier of the oxidizer used for the space shuttle and
military rockets.
   Construction of the $73 million Utah plant has continued under
interim financing, and the facility is expected to open in mid-May,
said C. Keith Rooker, executive vice president of PEPCON's parent,
American Pacific Corp.
   A 286,000-pound shipment of the oxidizer was seized Feb. 25 in
Rotterdam aboard a freighter bound for Iran. The 1,144 30-gallon
drums were enough to fuel 300 military missiles and were valued at
about $350,000, officials said.
   The shipment had been owned by a West German company, D.A.
Dampf, which obtained it from a Swiss company that had purchased it
from Girindus Corp. of Tampa, Fla., officials said. Girindus made
the initial purchase from PEPCON.
   Rooker said his company had investigated Girindus before selling
it the oxidizer and was satisified it was an ``honest and
reputable'' buyer.
   ``We never had any reason to know or suspect however remotely
that any material we manufactured or sold was going to Iran,'' said
Rooker.
   A federal judge in Houston ruled Tuesday that Girindus must
forfeit the shipment to the government. He said Customs agents had

   Authorities proclaimed a day of
mourning today for two police officers killed in bloody clashes in
Kosovo province that left at least 21 people dead and 74 injured.
   A spokeswoman for Kosovo's information office, Marija Gasi, told
The Associated Press, ``Today the situation in Kosovo is normal.
There has been no single extraordinary event.''
   However, Radmilo Bogdanovic, interior minister of the republic
of Serbia, described the situation as ``dramatic and changing from
hour to hour.''
   ``The security forces are making great efforts to restore peace
and order,'' Bogdanovic told Serbia's Parliament.
   The protests in Kosovo, which is part of the republic of Serbia,
began last week after Kosovo's Parliament approved constitutional
changes giving Serbia control of the provincial police, courts and
civil defense. Serbia's Parliament approved the changes Tuesday.
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million
citizens, say the changes threaten autonomy they won under the 1974
constitution.
   Protesters hurled stones at riot police, who responded with tear
gas. Two policemen, one an ethnic Albanian and one a Serb, were
shot and killed Monday. Officials said 19 protesters died Monday
and Tuesday.
   Sources in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, said there were
unconfirmed reports two more demonstrators died during the night
following clashes in the village of Zur, near the border of Albania.
   Police in Zur shot to death an 18-year-old Tuesday, and the
state-run Tanjug news agency reported 14 people injured in the
village, which was sealed off by police.
   The entire province was placed under an 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew
Tuesday.
   Bogdanovic estimated that on Monday, the worst day of bloodshed
and rioting, there were 14,000 mainly young ethnic Albanians on the
streets of Kosovo, battling 2,400 police.
   The Interior Ministry said 146 demonstrators were detained
Monday and Tuesday.
   There were rumors that several prominent ethnic Albanians,
including businessmen, government officials and university
professors, were questioned by police in connection with the
violence. They could not be confirmed.
   The deputy head of Pristina's university, Muhamed Bicaj, said he
heard of one philosophy professor being questioned by police
Tuesday night. The man was allowed to go home afterward, Bicaj said.
   Serbia says the constitutional changes are needed to protect the
province's Slav minority, which alleges harassment by ethnic
Albanians. At least 30,000 Slavs are estimated to have left Kosovo
since the last ethnic riots erupted there in 1981. At least nine
people died in the protests.
   The anniversary of those riots is Saturday. Officials hoped a
heavy police presence in Kosovo, in addition to tanks and other
military vehicles, would prevent new protests.
   Tanjug said 76 people were injured in the latest unrest, two
more than the figure released by the Interior Ministry.
   According to the ministry, 25 policemen were injured _ five
seriously _ and 49 demonstrators were hurt. It accused ethnic
Albanian ``nationalists and separatists'' of fomenting unrest and
sniping at police from buildings and rooftops.
   There have been frequent allegations since 1981, particularly in
Serbia, that Kosovo's ethnic Albanians have an organized
underground movement that wants to unite the province with Albania.
Ethnic Albanians deny such intentions.
   In addition to the ethnic tension, Kosovo has been hard hit by
the country's economic crisis. It is the poorest region of
Yugoslavia, where inflation is expected to hit 400 percent in April
and unemployment is 15 percent. In Kosovo, about 30 percent of the
population is unemployed.

   An 82-year-old man accused of robbing a
bank and making his getaway on a 10-speed bicycle may be the
``salt-and-pepper'' bandit wanted in nearly a dozen holdups in the
last two years, police said.
   ``We have had involvement with those I consider to be the `Over
The Hill' gang, where the suspects may be in their 70s. But this
may be the oldest one I've experienced,'' said Bob Pence, FBI agent
in charge in Colorado.
   Jack Kelm of Greeley, was arrested Tuesday in a bank robbery in
which a man in a stocking mask held employees at gunpoint and
pedaled off on a stolen bicycle with an undetermined amount of
cash, said Capt. Terry Lauhon.
   A man whose children apparently had seen the holdup man take off
a stocking mask followed him in his car and caught up with the
suspect in a store, took a starter's pistol from him and held him
for police, authorities said.
   Pence said Kelm also is a suspect in 10 robberies attributed to
the elderly ``salt-and-pepper'' bandit ``due to the description of
Mr. Kelm, ... due to the method and due to the locality and due to
the style if you will.''
   The bandit, who struck in Fort Collins, Loveland, Greeley and
Longmont, started in 1986 by robbing two cafeteries, then moved on
to banks and supermarkets.
   Pence said Kelm may have escaped from a Florida chain gang about
40 years ago, and authorities are delving into old files to confirm
that.
   Kelm was ordered held on federal bank robbery charges.

   China today ruled out the possibility of an
amnesty for political prisoners, saying it did not think such a
move was necessary.
   Wang Hanbin, vice chairman of the National People's Congress,
made the announcement shortly after seven human rights activists
from Hong Kong presented China's legislature with a letter calling
for the release of political prisoners.
   They specifically demanded the release of democracy advocate Wei
Jingsheng, who was arrested 10 years ago today and sentenced to 15
years in prison for ``counterrevolutionary crimes.''
   On Tuesday, Chinese customs officers held the Hong Kong human
rights activists at the Tanjin airport for three hours and seized a
petition calling for an amnesty signed by 24,000 people outside
China.
   The activists say they are concerned about future Chinese
treatment of Hong Kong, which returns to Chinese ownership in 1997.
   Since January, intellectuals in China have written four open
letters urging an amnesty and democratic change. So far, about 200
people have signed the petitions, which mark the 40th anniversary
of the founding of Communist China.
   One of the leaders of the Democracy Wall Movement of 1978, Wei
was jailed after he called for democratic change in China.
   ``We demand to meet with Wei Jingsheng and other political
prisoners in China, anytime, anywhere,'' said Emily Lau, a
journalist and a member of the Hong Kong group.
   In his statement to reporters, Vice Chairman Wang acknowledged
China has in the past released prisoners, such as war criminals and
members of the old Kuomintang army, defeated by the Communists in
1949.
   ``That was given to those who had turned over a new leaf in
life, and was in line with the country's specific conditions
then,'' he said.
   Referring to the country's 40th anniversary, he said, ``the
congress is not considering giving, nor does it think it necessary
to offer, special pardons to prisoners on the occasion.'' The
congress closes its annual session next week.
   Amnesty International, a London-based human rights group,
estimates thousands of Chinese prisoners have been jailed for their
beliefs.
   China maintains it has no political prisoners.
   Chinese customs agents seized the Hong Kong petition on Tuesday
when the human rights activists arrived in Tanjin, a city near
Beijing.
   The Hong Kong group, which returned home today, urged China to
release its petition, which was signed mostly by Chinese from Hong
Kong. But people from 34 countries also signed the petition.
   A Chinese customs official said the seizure was made because the
group was carrying ``an unreasonable amount of printed matter into
China.''
   He said he didn't know when the petitions would be returned.
   Hong Kong, a British colony since the 19th century, returns to
China in 1997. China has guaranteed to keep its liberal economic
and political system in place for 50 years but many Hong Kong
intellectuals are skeptical.
   The Tianjin incident marks one of the first times the question
of human rights in China has become intertwined with Hong Kong's
future.
   ``Without democracy in China, there cannot be possibilities for
democracy in Hong Kong,'' said Lau Tinchi, a member of the Hong
Kong group. ``The 1997 question before us is tied with the question
of whether democracy can be realized in China.''

<HEAD>Huge Bomb Defused In Belfast Business District</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Office buildings along one
street of Belfast's business district were evacuated for several
hours today while soldiers defused a 500-pound Irish Republican
Army bomb, police said.
   The bomb was discovered in a parked car one week after a
business organization told its members terrorists planned to target
them to destabilize the province's economy.
   The bomb was defused safely and no one was injured, said a
spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Northern Ireland's
police force.
   The device was found in Upper Queen Street after the outlawed
IRA telephoned a Belfast newspaper to say a bomb would go off in 15
minutes, said the police spokesman, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Police would not say what type of explosive was in the bomb.
They did say it was home made.
   The IRA is fighting to oust the British from the province and
unite it with the mainly Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   Last week, the Confederation of Business Industry's Northern
Ireland office warned its members to be vigilant, said its
director, Alistair MacLaughlin.
   He said the confederation ``had a warning from police that
paramilitary organizations were taking a greater interest in
economic targets.''
   ``We're not trying to be alarmist,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``We're just saying to members to be vigilant.''
   MacLaughlin refused to elaborate on the warning, or to say how
many members are in the confederation's Northern Ireland branch.

   A small homemade bomb exploded in front
of the U.S. consulate in Sao Paulo, but caused no injuries or
damage, the consulate and police said today.
   The bomb, which was placed at the entrance to the consulate
garage, went off when a car ran over it Tuesday, Kathy Brion, the
consulate's press spokeswoman, said. She said the bomb made a
``dull popping noise'' when it exploded.
   Miss Brion said she did not see any connection between the bomb
and a small rally held later Tuesday to protest U.S. policies in
Central America.
   The car, owned by a private company with offices in the
consulate building, was not damaged by the bomb, according to a
police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said police were looking for a man who approached a consulate
security guard on Monday night and demanded his gun. The man
reportedly threatened to return with a bomb when the guard refused,
the officer said.

   A paraplegic adventurer who nine months ago
crashed his single-engine airplane into the wilds of Greenland and
survived with just a cut on his face has died in his bed at home
after a bout with the flu.
   Clark Harrison, who died Tuesday of respiratory failure, was 64.
   Harrison, a pilot, author, politician, banker and real estate
broker, was paralyzed from the chest down by a sniper's bullet in
Germany during World War II.
   Harrison used a wheelchair and believed himself to be one of
only a few paraplegic veterans from his era to have lived into his
60s. He said he wanted to show young people with spinal cord
injuries what they can do with their lives.
   He served as a director for Shepherd Spinal Center, an Atlanta
rehabilitation hospital for paralyzing spinal disorders, since its
founding in 1975.
   He got his pilot's license at age 55 and, at age 60, flew a
hand-controlled single-engine airplane solo on an 8,600-mile round
trip to Anchorage, Alaska, to raise money for Shepherd.
   He was trying to raise money for the Shepherd Center for
Independent Living when he attempted his solo trans-Atlantic flight
last July to Germany, where he had hoped to visit the battlefield
in Stolberg where he was wounded.
   But his plane ran out of gas over Greenland and he crashed
nosefirst into a ditch in the rugged wilderness.
   He wrote a book about his adventure, ``The Barefoot Pilot,''
although he had not yet found a publisher, said Martha Foster, a
spokeswoman for Shepherd.
   Survivors include his wife, Emily Frances Harrison, two sons and
five grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

   No more sob stories, a city board ruled _ a
developer must lop the top 12 floors off a Manhattan high-rise.
   The Board of Standards and Appeals on Tuesday unanimously denied
a zoning variance to Parkview Associates, which had offered to
build about 40 low-income senior citizen apartments if it could
leave the building intact.
   The builder has said it stands to lose $10 million by
dismantling the fought-over floors.
   But the board ruled, ``There are no unique physical conditions
peculiar to and inherent in the particular zoning lot which give
rise to ... unnecessary hardship in complying with the provisions
of the zoning resolution.''
   Parkview, which erected the 31-story tower after city officials
misread a zoning map that limited buildings to 19 floors, had gone
all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court to avoid dismantling the 12
stories that were topped off in 1986.
   Parkview attorney Jay Segal said he would meet with the
developer in the next few days to decide whether to comply or
appeal to state Supreme Court.
   ``This is a very strong message: zoning is not for sale. No more
indulging developers,'' said Genie Rice, president of a
neighborhood group that led opposition to the building. ``You can't
decide to go ahead with a project and then buy your way out.''
   The fight began in 1986, when Ms. Rice discovered the building
violated zoning laws. A state appeals court later ordered the upper
floors removed, saying that Parkview must share the blame for not
discovering the city's mistake.
   The U.S. Supreme Court left that ruling intact last year.
   Dismantling of the extra floors would be the same process used
to tear down old buildings; protective scaffolding is placed
outside and workers pry off the brick facing, break the concrete
floor into chunks and cut through metalwork.

   Police in Alexandria, Va., were tracking down
suspected drug dealers and abusers who live in public housing after
the federal government granted an unprecedented exemption making it
easier to evict them.
   ``The police are out on the street now arresting people and
getting their addresses,'' Mayor James P. Moran said Tuesday after
being told that the Department of Housing and Urban Development had
granted the District of Columbia suburb an exemption from federal
housing grievance regulations.
   Moran said the exemption, requested after the killing of a
police officer and a drug-seeking gunman outside a housing project
a week ago, was needed to eliminate time-consuming and costly
regulations that discouraged local officials from pursuing
evictions.
   Without the exemption, HUD regulations required local government
officials to allow tenants threatened with evictions to appeal
first to a federal administrative panel and then to the courts.
   ``Our review of the Virginia statutes indicated a system of
opportunities for two full trials ... a full range of due process
guarantees,'' HUD general counsel-designate Frank Keating said in
explaining the agency's decision.
   Although the exemption is directed at Alexandria, Keating said
``the law is the same throughout the state (of Virginia) and if
other housing authorities had chronic drug activity'' they could
expect to be exempted as well.
   However Keating said the exemption would be limited to evictions
involving ``drug and drug-related activity.''
   Last month, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp sent a memo to the directors
of the nation's 3,300 public housing authorities asking them to
report on steps they were taking to combat the drug trade on their
properties.
   Kemp pledged ``to assist you and law-abiding residents in
eliminating this plague from public housing.''
   ``We're not going to take any chances on evicting anybody that
might prove innocent,'' said Mayor Moran, explaining that the city
would pursue evictions only in those cases where they have current
evidence ``of criminal activity either committed by or condoned by
the the public housing leaseholder.''
   ``We're going to take advantage of it in both responsible and
expeditious way to be a model for other housing authorities,'' he
said.
   Moran said police had a list of 45 people in the city's public
housing units who were targeted.
   The city sought the exemption at a meeting with HUD officials on
Monday in the wake of a hostage-taking and fatal shootout at a
public housing development in the Old Town section.
   Last week Jamie Martin Wise, 34, an escapee from a Washington,
D.C., halfway house entered an apartment in the development,
demanded crack cocaine and held five people hostage.
   Wise later released four of the hostages but emerged from the
building with the fifth hostage at gunpoint. Wise was shot by a
police sharpshooter and fatally wounded police Cpl. Charles W. Hill
before succumbing to his own wounds. Another officer was wounded.
   Moran said the city was granted the exemption after
demonstrating to HUD officials that state law would insure tenants
facing eviction would receive due process without the inclusion of
some federal regulatory requirements.
   He said tenants would retain their rights to appeal evictions in
federal and district court with the options of a trial by jury or
civil discovery.
   ``There's a substantial protection already in the law,'' Moran
said.
   But a lawyer who won an injunction in federal court last January
against new HUD regulations that included granting exemptions to
the grievance procedures disagreed.
   ``I think HUD doesn't have the right to grant the waiver,'' said
David Bryson of the National Law Housing Center in Berkeley, Calif.
   ``There is a serious question whether their granting the waiver
would be in contempt'' of the injunction, said Bryson.
   ``The injunction that the judge entered does not cover these
specific issues. It had to do with (withholding) the publication of
the new grievance procedures until a number of features were
incorporated with tenant input,'' Keating countered.
   Maria Foscarinis, an attorney for the National Coalition for the
Homeless, an homeless advocacy group, said, ``The concern with drug
activity in public housing is understandable but the response seems
a little out of proportion.''

<TEXT>
   Two armed Czechoslovak teen-agers
hijacked a jet in Prague today and reportedly demanded it fly to
the United States. They surrendered and freed their hostages _
including a Hungarian diplomat _ after the plane landed in
Frankfurt.
   No injuries were reported among the 10 passengers and at least
four crew members aboard the hijacked Hungarian plane when it
reached Frankfurt, officials said.
   The hijackers released 82 passengers at Prague airport after
speaking with Lajos Taba, the Hungarian consul-general, the
Hungarian news agency MTI said. It said Taba traded himself for the
passengers and was among those freed in Frankfurt.
   The gunmen surrendered less than three hours after seizing the
Soviet-made Tupolev-154 owned by Hungary's Malev Airlines.
   MTI said the hijackers demanded to be taken to the United
States, but West German officials said the gunmen's motives were
not known.
   The hijackers, who were armed with guns and carried a fake hand
grenade, gave up at Frankfurt Airport when U.S. officials prevented
the plane from taxiing onto adjoining U.S. military base.
   A witness said a policeman collapsed during a shootout at Prague
airport when the hijackers took a hostage and forced their way onto
the aircraft.
   Hans Neitze, chief spokesman for Frankfurt police, said: ``We
found the emptied casing of a bullet, and we assume that there was
at least one shot fired on the aircraft.'' He offered no further
details.
   Criminal investigator Roland Desch said the hijackers initially
demanded to be flown ``overseas'' but were convinced by the
airliner's crew that the plane could not fly that far. The plane
then went to Frankfurt.
   ``As far as I know, all passengers are safe. It ended without
bloodshed,'' airport spokesman Hans Rainer Otto said. Frankfurt
police spokesman Karl-Heinz Wagner also said there were no injuries
among those aboard the plane.
   Wagner said the youths were Czechoslovak citizens aged 15 and 16.
   ``We still don't know what their motive was,'' Wagner said,
adding the two youths were being questioned by police. He said the
hijackers were armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a rifle and
carried a fake grenade.
   Wolfgang Schwalm, a spokesman at Frankfurt airport, said the
hijackers gave up after officials refused to accept them at the
U.S. Air Force's Rhein-Main Base, which is located at the airport.
U.S. officials confirmed that.
   ``The pair wanted to go to the American side of the airport,''
he told reporters. ``The Americans declined accepting them, and at
that point the hijackers gave up.'' Desch said a military truck was
driven onto the tarmac to prevent the jet from reaching the U.S.
base.
   A U.S. Air Force spokesman, Eberhard Bock, said the jet was
halted on the taxiway.
   ``Two men got off the plane and they were held by U.S. military
security police until the German police arrived and took over,''
Bock said.
   The jet had been en route to Amsterdam, said Hungarian radio,
which was monitored in Budapest. It did not say where the flight
originated.
   Witnesses at Prague's airport said two hijackers forced their
way into the VIP lounge and took a female airport employee hostage.
   They then broke the glass wall of the airport building to get
onto the tarmac where they aimed their guns at a policeman, said
the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There was shooting and the policeman collapsed, but it was not
clear whether he had been shot, the witnesses said. The two men
forced their way onto the plane but left their hostage behind, the
witnesses said.

<TEXT>
   An important radio telescope as wide as
a football field collapsed because a 50-inch steel plate had
weakened, said engineers investigating the loss of the nation's
most precise astronomical instrument.
   The 25-year-old telescope, which resembled a 300-foot-wide
satellite dish, collapsed Nov. 15 as the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory used it to map the universe.
   Until a replacement is built, mapping work will shift to a
140-foot-wide telescope at the observatory in Green Bank, said Jim
Condon of the observatory's headquarters in Charlottesville, Va.
   ``It's an annoyance, but it's not fatal,'' he said. Officials
hope to have the replacement built by 1993.
   A panel of engineers hired by the National Science Foundation
said Tuesday the 600-ton dish collapsed because of a ripped steel
plate.
   ``It's kind of like this: If you have a pyramid on three pillars
and you crack one of the pillars, it's going to come at you,'' said
Ludwig Oster, National Science Foundation astronomy director.
   Scientists who inspected the structure annually failed to detect
stress on the plate because the lattice support structure under the
dish obscured the trouble spot, according to an engineers' report.
   The document did not blame anyone for failing to discover the
problem.
   The foundation said it will cost $70 million to replace the
telescope, but that the new one will be larger, sturdier and more
flexible. The original telescope, which could be adjusted only on a
north-south axis, cost $850,000.

   A black detainee escaped today
and took refuge in the U.S. Consulate, officials said. Six other
former detainees sought refuge in the British Embassy and demanded
an end to restrictions on their activities.
   Police said Simon Ntombela, a teacher and anti-apartheid
organizer who has been on a hunger strike, eluded six guards and
escaped at daybreak from Shifa Hospital in the port city of Durban.
   Gene Friedman, a U.S. Embassy spokesman, said late this
afternoon that Ntombela had reached Johannesburg, 360 miles away,
and was at the U.S. Consulate.
   ``We have been in touch with the South African government with a
view toward resolving this case as expeditiously as possible,''
said Friedman. He did not say how Ntombela reached the consulate.
   Ntombela, 27, was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital
since September. He fled as the government announced new steps to
prevent such breakouts.
   Seven other detainees who escaped from hospitals since September
quickly sought safety in foreign diplomatic missions. The
government allowed all seven to remain free.
   Shortly before midday today, six black activists entered the
British Embassy in Pretoria and said they would stay until the
government lifted restrictions imposed on them following their
release.
   The embassy issued a statement saying the six ``cannot stay
indefinitely on British government premises and should leave.''
   ``We are nevertheless prepared to draw to the attention of the
South African government once again to the issue of restrictions,
but we do not believe that the visitors' case is being furthered by
their continued stay in the embassy,'' the statement said.
   One of the six was Donsie Khumalo, a regional official of the
Congress of South African Trade Unions, the main black labor
federation. He was released last week after staging a hunger strike
to protest being held without charge.
   Like many other freed activists, Khumalo, 39, is barred from
various political activities, required to report to a police
station twice daily, and confined to his house at night.
   The other activists who entered the embassy compound were
involved with anti-apartheid organizations in the Pretoria area.
   Colleagues of the six said their intention was to encourage
Britain to pressure South African authorities to lift restrictions
on all former detainees.
   Their move coincided with a visit by British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher to neighboring Zimbabwe. She was expected to
discuss the South African political situation with officials from
Zimbabwe and Mozambique.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok, said Ntombela's escape proved ``that stricter control
will have to be placed on persons hospitalized and who are in
custody. A central facility for this purpose will have to be made
available.''
   Mellet said detainees who go on hunger strikes in the future
will be placed in Grootvlei Prison in Bloemfontein and, if they
require hospital treatment, will be sent to Pelomini provincial
hospital outside the city.
   Bloemfontein is a relatively remote provincial capital in
central South Africa, where detainees would have more difficulty
escaping and where publicity about the hunger strike campaign might
be reduced.
   An estimated 600 detainees have gone on hunger strikes since
January to protest being held without charge. The government says
most detainees have been freed since the fasts began, but human
rights activists say several hundred remain in detention.
   The detainees are held under a state of emergency declared
almost three years ago to quell anti-apartheid unrest in black
townships.
   South Africa's system of apartheid establishes a racially
segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs while the 5 million whites control the economy,
schools and health services.
   Ntombela's lawyer, Dahya Pillay, said Ntombela was detained in
Johannesburg Sept. 2 and was admitted to hospital in early March
for treatment of depression. Ms. Pillay said he began a hunger
strike March 13.

<HEAD>Court Improperly Barred Oklahoma Taxes on Off-Reservation Businesses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court improperly barred Oklahoma
officials from taxing bingo games and cigarette sales at a motel
run by the Chickasaw Indian tribe outside its reservation, the
Supreme Court ruled today.
   In an unsigned opinion, the court sent the case back to state
courts in Oklahoma to decide the dispute.
   The fact that the tribe may have grounds under federal law to
claim immunity from the taxes does not give the federal courts
initial authority to rule in the dispute, the high court said.
   The justices overturned a ruling by the 10th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals that barred Oklahoma from imposing the taxes. But
today's ruling does not decide whether, in fact, Oklahoma may
impose the taxes.
   The motel run by the Chickasaws is located within the city
limits of Sulphur, Okla., and was purchased by the tribe from the
federal Small Business Administration in 1972.
   The federal government retains title to the land on which the
motel sits, holding it in trust for the tribe.
   Oklahoma officials said an Indian tribe should not have complete
immunity from state laws in areas off the reservation.
   The 10th Circuit court ruled against the state in June 1987,
saying tribal sovereign immunity bars such suits against Indian
tribes unless Congress specifically authorizes them.
   The Supreme Court in December 1987 temporarily set aside the
ruling and ordered further study by the appeals court in light of
the justices' 1987 ruling in a California case that restricted the
transfer of state court suits to federal courts.
   The justices in the California case barred a federal court from
presiding over a suit by workers who said they were fired illegally.
   The 10th Circuit court, after restudying the Chickasaw case,
again ruled in favor of the tribe last year.
   In today's ruling, the Supreme Court said the 10th Circuit court
ruling is ``plainly inconsistent'' with the justices' decision in
the California case.
   There were no recorded dissents.
   The case is Oklahoma Tax Commission vs. Graham, 88-266.

   Motorists who lobbed everything from
cherry bombs to bras into bridge toll baskets to protest higher
taxes and tolls can just drive on through starting Sept. 1.
   All road and bridge tolls in Jacksonville will be lifted as a
result of a new half-cent sales tax that went into effect Jan. 1,
the Jacksonville Transportation Authority said Tuesday.
   Until the toll plazas are torn down, motorists will be directed
to drive through without stopping.
   A year ago, citizens voted to replace the city's bridge and road
tolls with a sales tax. But the tolls continued after the tax went
into effect.
   Before the tolls are removed, transportation officials must
refinance state bridge bonds using sales tax revenue instead of
toll collections.

<HEAD>Rains Flood Eastern Texas, Herald End to Warm Spell</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rain today cooled a warm spell from Texas to New England after
causing flash flooding that swamped cars in eastern Texas.
   Despite widespread showers and thunderstorms, high temperatures
today were forecast to be 10 to 20 degrees warmer than normal from
southern New England across the Carolinas and into Georgia and
Alabama. But not for long.
   Boston, whose 81-degree high on Tuesday broke a 1946 record by 4
degrees and inspired many to take their lunches out to parks or
head for the banks of the Charles River, was expected to reach only
40 degree by Thursday.
   On Tuesday, water up to 5 feet deep on a highway between Tyler
and Lufkin sent motorists scurrying up trees and onto the roofs of
their cars, said Ruby Taylor, a dispatcher at the Cherokee County
sheriff's office.
   ``This is the worst I've ever seen in my whole life and I've
been here a long time,'' she said.
   Parts of Cherokee County have received more than 11 inches of
rain this week. Officials closed roads there and in adjacent Rusk
County and evacuated at least two apartment complexes in Henderson.
No injuries were reported.
   Tornadoes touched down this morning in Texas west of
Nacogdoches, south of Lufkin, and at Huntington, and at Anacoco,
La. Authorities said downed trees were blocking roads in affected
areas, hampering efforts to assess damage.

<HEAD>Louvre Under Glass Opens to Public</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of controversy and public debate, a
renovated and sparkling Louvre museum opened today, crowned by a
tall glass pyramid at its new entrance.
   After President Francois Mitterrand cut the ribbon at the
inauguration ceremony and toured the collection, hundreds of people
crowded in for a look.
   ``It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said Martine
Bieri-Duminy, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid, designed by
American architect I.M. Pei, being built.
   ``In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it.
They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said.
   The dark, dingy Louvre most tourists remember is now a thing of
the past. In its place is what is called the ``Grand Louvre,'' a
splendid ultramodern and high-tech facility.
   The six-year, $850 million overhaul is the first part of a vast
project to turn the Louvre, once a medieval fortress and then a
royal palace, into the world's largest museum _ a distinction now
held by the American Museum of Natural History in New York.
   The Louvre project will be completed when the museum's northern
wings, occupied by the Finance Ministry for the past 100 years,
open to the public in 1993.
   The Grand Louvre is a unique blend of grandeur, history and
convenience.
   Visitors who once wandered looking for the museum's entrance
can't miss the new one _ a 70-foot, transparent pyramid soaring out
between the Louvre's main wings and flanked by three small pyramids
and fountains.
   At the ground-level entrance are escalators and a graceful
spiral staircase leading down to a vast, light-drenched lobby
featuring ticket windows, the museum bookstore, boutiques,
restaurants and a 400-seat auditorium.
   The lobby itself can handle 6,000 people time without crowding.
Escalators leading to other parts of the museum branch out from the
lobby, like spokes in a wheel, and shorten the routes to works like
the Mona Lisa and Winged Victory.
   The baroque architecture of the Louvre built under Napoleon III
looms large against the ever-changing Paris skyscape.
   ``I used to pray for sun,'' Pei said in an interview.
``Afterward, I realized that the pyramid is even more transparent
on a gray day when it takes on the moodiness of the Paris sky.''
   A visit to the Louvre is a trip back in time. Visitors now have
direct access to the vestiges of the medieval castle built by King
Louis Philippe in 1200 to protect Paris from invaders from England.
   Also on show is a history of the Louvre documented by thousands
of artifacts dug up in the Napoleon courtyard. They bring to life
the daily routines of Parisians from the 15th to the 19th centuries.
   With about 650,000 square feet of additional floor space,
hundreds of paintings will have been dusted off and displayed for
the first time.
   On view for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by
Charles Le Brun (1619-1690) titled ``L'Histoire d'Alexandre.''
   When the Grand Louvre is completed in 1993, it will house about
4,000 items, nearly double what it displays today.
   Pei's pyramid, in specially manufactured slightly tinted glass,
was the most controversial aspect of the renovation.
   ``Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' Pei said. ``Not many people
would have bet on this project.''
   Backed strongly by Mitterrand, who initiated the project, Pei
perservered. The public was won over when a full-size model was
erected on the spot.
   ``All through the centuries, the Louvre has undergone violent
changes,'' Pei said. ``The time had to be right. I was confident
because this is the right time.''

   The Supreme Court today barred states from
denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their
Sabbath even if the refusal is not based on a religious sect's
doctrine.
   The justices, in a unanimous 9-0 decision, said Illinois
officials violated a Peoria man's religious freedom by denying him
unemployment benefits.
   The high court previously had barred states from denying
unemployment benefits to people who refuse certain work because of
religious scruples. But in all previous cases, the workers' refusal
was based on the teachings of an established religious group such
as the Seventh-day Adventists or the Jehovah's Witnesses.
   Justice Byron R. White wrote for the court, ``Never did we
suggest that unless a claimant belongs to a sect that forbids what
his job requires, his belief, however sincere, must be deemed a
purely personal preference rather than a religious belief.''
   The ruling means, for example, that a Methodist or Roman
Catholic might be eligible for unemployment benefits after refusing
to work on Sunday even though neither church bars Sunday work as
part of its official doctrine.
   In another ruling, the court overturned a federal appeals court
ruling barring Oklahoma from taxing bingo games and cigarette sales
at a motel run by the Chickasaw Indian tribe outside its
reservation. The justices' unsigned opinion sent the case back to
Oklahoma's state courts for a decision.
   In the case dealing with work on the Sabbath, William Frazee of
Peoria was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits after
turning down in 1984 a temporary job assignment that would have
required him to work on Sunday.
   Frazee said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of
Christianity is that non-emergency work on Sundays is forbidden.
   The Illinois Department of Employment Security ruled that
Frazee's rejection of the job offer disqualified him from receiving
unemployment benefits.
   State officials, while not questioning Frazee's sincerity, said
a refusal to work due to religious scruples must be based ``on some
tenet or dogma accepted by the individual of some church, sect or
denomination'' _ and not based merely on personal religious
convictions.
   Frazee sued, and Illinois courts ruled against him. But the
Supreme Court today said the state courts were wrong.
   White rejected arguments by state officials that a victory for
Frazee would lead to Americans seeking Sundays off because they
want to shop, play sports or even watch football on television.
   ``We are unpersuaded that there will be a mass movement away
from Sunday employ if William Frazee succeeds in his claim,'' White
said.
   ``There may exist state interests sufficiently compelling to
override a legitimate claim to the free exercise of religion,'' he
added. ``No such interest has been presented here.''
   The case dealing with Sabbath work is Frazee vs. Employment
Security Department, 87-1945. The Chickasaw case is Oklahoma Tax
Commission vs. Graham, 88-266.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Murder Charge: Police Lied to Obtain Search Warrant</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing a detective during a drug
raid cannot be tried because police lied to obtain the search
warrant, a judge ruled today.
   Superior Court Judge Charles M. Grabau dismissed the murder
charge against Albert Lewin, ending a case that has raised question
about whether police routinely lie in obtaining warrants.
   ``A fair trial is not possible,'' the judge told a jammed
courtroom. ``The conduct was egregious ... and the evidence is
tainted.''
   Lewin, 33, was charged in the slaying of Detective Sherman
Griffiths during a raid Feb. 17, 1988. Griffiths, 36, was trying to
break into an apartment when he was hit by a bullet fired through
the door.
   Police later admitted that they had obtained the search warrant
on the word of an informant who didn't exist. Lewin did not match
the warrant's description of the cocaine dealer police said
occupied the apartment.
   Detectives Carlos A. Luna, 32, Hugo Amate, 31, and Paul
Schroeder, 33, have been suspended while under investigation for
possible perjury.
   The court had no choice but to dismiss the case, said Max Stern,
Lewin's attorney. ``It was not a lie it was hundreds of lies,'' he
said. ``And in an effort to reinstate the case, it was just more
lies.''
   But prosecutors had argued that because there was strong
evidence against Lewin and because police had admitted their
misconduct, the case should be tried.
   Grabau ordered Lewin held for 24 hours while prosecutors decide
whether to appeal his decision.

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on our wasteful ways:
   The report (from the Worldwatch Institute, an environmental
research group that has surveyed the Earth's condition annually
since 1984) says unchecked pollution, land mismanagement and
population growth have pushed the world to the brink of a
drought-fueled global food shortage.
   The institute's report offers only one hope: a growing awareness
of the environmental hazards at hand.
   So let's think about the effects of spraying that aerosol can,
of using plastic over recyclable paper products, of letting
companies discharge their waste into the ocean, of running the
water unnecessarily, of driving alone instead of using mass
transportation, of paving over all the farmland, of wasting good
food.
   Until we start to change our wasteful ways, the world will
remain on its grim path.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on planting trees:
   Planting a tree seems like such a little thing. How could it
become one way that the average person can save Earth from
overheating? ...
   Los Angeles has launched a campaign to encourage the city and
its citizens to plant from two million to five million trees in the
next five years.
   The trees would cool sidewalks and buildings, provide attractive
screening of freeways and concrete buildings, and _ most of all _
absorb carbon dioxide that is believed to be the major cause of an
impending worldwide warming trend. ...
   Since Los Angeles turns out more carbon dioxide, as well as many
other harmful chemicals, than just about any other city in the
world, it is a good place to start a campaign to plant trees.
   Trees, like other vegetation, consume carbon dioxide as fuel and
give off oxygen as a byproduct. ...
   Last week the Environmental Protection Agency threw its weight
behind tree-planting. ...
   The agency recommended stopping the net global deforestation by
planting at least as many trees as are felled.

   The Journal, New Ulm, Minn., on the minimum wage proposals:
   The House of Representatives is on a collision course with
George Bush over the issue of minimum wage.
   The House passed a bill ... that sets the minimum wage at $4.55
per hour, 30 cents higher than Bush's proposal. The bill does
include a subminimum wage provision for first-time workers, a
provision that Bush also supports.
   Bush has vowed to veto the bill, and it appears the House does
not now have the votes to override his veto.
   The Senate version of the bill calls for raising the minimum
wage to $4.65 per hour and doesn't include a subminimum wage,
though that could be included as a compromise.
   Congress should take care in adjusting the minimum wage. There
is a danger, economists agree, that hiking the wage will result in
fewer jobs, especially for people just starting out in the job
market.

   Democrat and Chronicle and Times-Union, Rochester, N.Y., on the
Alaska oil spill:
   The largest oil spill in U.S. history is more than a tragedy,
it's an outrage.
   The 11-million-gallon spill last Friday, from the tanker Exxon
Valdez, was not only predictable but predicted. And with routine
care, it could have been prevented.
   The tanker collided at least twice with rocks in the
hard-to-navigate waters of Prince William Sound, 25 miles south of
Valdez, the southern terminus of the Trans Alaska Pipeline. ...
   The corporate attitude has always been, ``Get off our backs; we
know what we're doing.''
   Clearly, the companies have lost the argument, but
environmentally conscious citizens can't take much comfort in
I-told-you-so's _ not when the price is 11 million gallons of
spilled oil that could damage coastal waters for years to come.

   The Houston Post on Newt Gingrich as House Republican whip:
   Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives have sent out a
message: No more Mister Nice Guy.
   By choosing Georgia bulldog Newt Gingrich as minority whip, the
vastly outnumbered Republican members turned away from traditional,
moderate leadership and toward confrontational politics.
   Gingrich _ replacing Dick Cheney of Wyoming, who left Congress
to become secretary of defense _ has a well-deserved reputation as
a partisan fighter.
   In addition, there is no love lost between Gingrich and House
Speaker Jim Wright.
   But there is too much work ahead for all the members to allow
rancor and back-biting to dominate this session. Gingrich will best
serve his party, his colleagues and his country, by keeping this in
mind.

   The Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I., on drug testing:
   In a time when substance abuse has become such a problem that
the federal authorities have seen fit to appoint an anti-drug czar,
it was inevitable that testing employees for illicit drugs would be
included in the government's arsenal of weapons.
   And in a system where every policy is measured against
constitutional standards, it was equally certain that the Supreme
Court would someday have to rule on the legitimacy of such testing
programs.
   That process has now produced its first major pronouncements. ...
   In our view, these decisions are reasonable attempts to
determine the circumstances under which federal employees' rights
of privacy must give way to their employees' duty to protect the
public.

   The Hemet (Calif.) News on drug testing:
   In its first ruling on mandatory drug tests, the U.S. Supreme
Court appropriately put public safety ahead of privacy rights.
   It upheld federal regulations requiring testing of railroad
crews after train accidents. The rules were put in place to deter
employees from using drugs and alcohol. ...
   In a separate case, ... the court also upheld a Customs Service
policy of testing employees or applicants seeking jobs involving
seizing drugs or carrying firearms. ...
   Some 40 cases remain in the pipeline, several of which probably
will reach the high court. One involves the testing of air traffic
controllers, who surely ought to fit the court's definition of
workers who may be tested for public safety reasons.

   The Bellingham (Wash.) Herald on Soviet reforms:
   The longer perestroika _ economic reform _ and glasnost _
greater openess _ are allowed in the Soviet Union, the more a
revolutionary political notion is reaffirmed.
   Give people the opportunity, and inevitably they yearn to be
free, to control their own lives instead of having them controlled
by government. ...
   Many Western observers doubt that the new Soviet revolution can
succeed. They may be right. Some Communist Party officials are
abrogating power and privileges grudgingly; some Soviet citizens
fear change. ...
   If Soviet authorities continue to give the people a legitimate
voice in choosing what that change will be, count on them to do
what people almost always do: opt for more freedom. ...
   When people are allowed to flourish they have more to give back;
if they aren't, they'll rebel when given a chance.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on the Soviet elections:
   For the first time since 1917, the Soviet Union held a contested
election Sunday, and its architect, Mikhail Gorbachev, professed
satisfaction. Instead, he has reason for concern.
   Evidence from the quasi-democratic balloting for a new
parliament suggests the party apparatus, after seven decades of
autocratic rule and a virtual monopoly on propaganda, enjoys shaky
loyalty from the ordinary worker.
   Only 1,500 of the 2,250 seats in the Congress of People's
Deputies were up for grabs, of which 384 were one-candidate
``races.'' No fewer than 750 deputies, including Gorbachev, were
appointed to the congress by the party leadership and official
organizations it controls.
   Nevertheless, the results of many real contests must alarm the
Kremlin. In the Baltic states, nationalists who demand autonomy or
independence from Moscow did well. In Moscow and other cities, a
handful of radicals who favor a multi-party system, anathema to
Gorbachev, were elected.
   If, as much of the world believes, a regime's legitimacy derives
from the people's consent, Grobachev has a lot of fast talking to
do.

   The Miami Herald, Tuesday on following the Soviets' election
lead:
   It wasn't the no-holds-barred, y'all-come kind of election that
American's take for granted, but the Soviet vote on Sunday was
historic nonetheless.
   Observers barely recognized the nation that for 70 years has
accepted Lenin's view that elections are too cumbersome a mechanism
for a revolutionary government. ...
   Could such a thing happen in Havana? Of course _ if Fidel
Castro's boot were lifted from the people's necks.
   And why not? If the state's economic policies can be the subject
of an electoral debate in Moscow, and if two opponents who are
military officers can contend for and against the Soviet draft, why
not in Cuba?
   And if bold reporters can ask candidates about such state-set
perquisites as the size of their apartments in Moscow, why not in
Nicaragua? Angola? ...
   Those reasons are no longer good enough in Marxism's
unchallenged capital, Moscow. They cannot for much longer hold sway
among Moscow's imitators.

   The Arizona Daily Star, Tucson, Ariz., on Salvadoran elections:
   El Salvador's newly elected president understands the importance
of winning favor with a generous U.S. Congress. So, be skeptical,
Congress.
   Alfredo Cristiani's talk about wanting to run a ``government at
the people's service'' could reflect a sincere desire to bring
peace to his embattled country.
   Or it could be a cynical attempt to keep the bucks flowing from
the north. This country has sent $3.5 billion in mostly military
aid to El Salvador in this decade; U.S. aid exceeds El Salvador's
national budget.
   That money bought a lot of sorrow. The eight-year civil war cost
about 70,000 lives.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte will be turning the government of
El Salvador over to an elected successor. That could be seen as a
component of establishing a democratic tradition in Central America.
   But all those American dollars have neither ended the civil war
nor improved the living conditions for the 1.3 million El
Salvadorans. ...
   Nor has the money bought much political change. ...
   So, be careful, Congress. Make sure American dollars aren't used
to buy more misery in Central America.

   Green Bay (Wis.) Press-Gazette on safer Navy training:
   To its credit, the United States Navy will put into practice
training reforms recommended after the March 1988 death of Appleton
(Wis.) recruit Lee Mirecki.
   Unfortunately, the Navy was forced to make training safer by the
horrible circumstances of Mirecki's death. The 19-year-old recruit
was literally frightened to death when instructors forced him to
continue a swimming exercise at a base in Florida.
   The Navy covered up the incident. Anonymous calls from recruits
to Mirecki's family sparked an investigation that resulted in
negligent homicide and battery convictions against an instructor.
   The training reforms, recommended by the General Accounting
Office after its investigation, stress safety. More important, they
prohibit the sort of intimidation by instructors that figured in
Mirecki's death.
   The reforms are overdue. The Navy must make sure they become
permanent.

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Star on the Bush puppies:
   The joy at the White House with First Dog Millie and her six new
puppies is understandable.
   The Bush family loves dogs, apparently, and that is a good
example for Americans who think the family pet is something to be
tied in the backyard for endless hours or left to run through the
neighbor's petunias. ...
   But what kind of other example is the First Family making with
this ``miracle of birth''?
   Naturally the puppies all are spoken for, with new homes
awaiting them. But that isn't the case for so many other puppies
not born in the White House. ...
   People should neuter their pets to avoid bringing more unwanted
animals into the world. If they want to adopt a new one, there are
plenty awaiting homes at all the animal shelters and humane
societies.

<HEAD>Belgian Actress Madeleine Ozeray Dies at 80</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Madeleine Ozeray, the Belgian actress
whose career spanned a half century of French cinema, has died in
Paris at age 80, a newspaper said today.
   The daily Vers l'Avenir did not say when the actress died or
give the cause of death. She will be buried Thursday in Bouillon,
her birthplace in southern Belgium, the newspaper said.
   Miss Ozeray's first major roles came in the 1930s, when she
starred in such classic French movies as ``Une Silhouette dans
Knock,'' made by actor-director Louis Jouvet, her companion for
many years.
   In the 1970s, she played in such hit movies as ``La Race des
Seigneurs,'' with Simone Signoret, and ``Le Vieux Fusil,'' with
Romy Schneider and Philippe Noiret.
   Miss Ozeray's last film was ``Les Gens de l'Ete,'' directed by
Claude Chabrol in 1981.
   Three years ago, French Culture Minister Jack Lang made Miss
Ozeray a Commander of Arts and Letters, France's highest cultural
distinction.
   Born and raised among the wooded hills of the Ardennes, Miss
Ozeray moved to Brussels at age 15. By age 23, she was a success in
the theater there.

   Democrat Jill Long, the upset winner in
a special election for the House seat once held by Dan Quayle,
received a congratulatory call today from the vice president.
   ``He wished me well and congratulated me and offered to assist
in any way because he's committed to the Fourth District,'' said
Long, whose victory after two previous failed campaigns ended a
13-year Republican hold on the district.
   Long, 36, a business professor, received 65,160 votes or 51
percent to 63,388 votes or 49 percent for Republican Dan Heath.
   Republican party chairman Lee Atwater said in Washington he was
``ashamed'' the GOP had lost. ``I have no excuses. We should have
won that race. I am very surprised we lost it,'' he said.
   Atwater paid the winner a backhanded compliment when he said she
``ran a campaign I would have been proud of'' that included plenty
of attacks against Heath.
   The victory was the Democrats' first in the northeast Indiana
district since 1974 and ended a string of seven GOP victories, some
marked by 2-1 margins, that Quayle began in 1976.
   Long told Quayle she had learned valuable lessons in her Senate
campaign against him in 1986.
   At her first news conference as representative-elect today, Long
said she didn't regard the election as a test of strength between
national Republicans and Democrats, despite the help from
Washington for both campaigns.
   ``This was just a race between two individuals in northeast
Indiana,'' she said.
   ``It's a hard pill to swallow, but I am a man, and a good man,
and I did my best,'' said Heath, who claimed Long had distorted his
record with negative advertising painting him as a privileged
lawyer and a bureaucrat.
   The Democrats seized an unexpected opportunity presented when
incumbent Dan Coats resigned in January to take the Senate seat
vacated when Quayle became vice president.
   Running a familiar candidate against a relative unknown,
Democrats poured at least $250,000 into the campaign in less than
two months and former Democratic presidential hopeful Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. of Tennessee stumped for Long.
   Heath, 36, received as much support from Republicans but was
tied to the unpopular administration of Mayor Paul Helmke, whom he
served as safety director.
   Heath lost despite campaign visits by Quayle, Barbara Bush and
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   Long lost the November general election by nearly 50,000 votes
to Coats, a former House aide to Quayle who took over the seat when
Quayle mounted his first successful Senate race in 1980.
   Two years earlier, Quayle drubbed Long to win his second Senate
term.
   Long ran those races with minimal funding and was criticized by
some party regulars for not campaigning aggressively, but she said
the experience paved the way for Tuesday's victory.
   ``I think I had generated or built a lot of support in 1986 and
again last year in two very tough races,'' she said. ``I think by
holding news conferences and traveling throughout the district, I
was able to get my message out.
   ``And that is that I will be an independent voice for northeast
Indiana and my country.''
   Long said she expected to be sworn in Monday, giving Indiana
Democrats a 7-3 advantage in the state's delegation in Congress.
   Campaign officials in both parties had predicted a light voter
turnout with estimates ranging as low as 25 to 30 percent, but
nearly half the district's 267,000 registered voters cast ballots.

   Authorities cut off
food, water and power at a prison farm today where armed inmates
were holed up for a fourth day with hundreds of people who were
visiting when the prisoners revolted.
   ``It's the only way we can pressure them,'' Carlos Ramos
Moncada, inspector general of prisons, said of the mutinous
inmates. ``If we don't they could stay inside for days or weeks,''
he told reporters as he entered the prison.
   He said supplies and power was cut off before dawn to the area
of the prison controlled by scores of rebellious inmates.
   Witnesses said Tuesday that as many as 100 inmates and about 600
visitors had depleted food stocked in the area under their control.
   Authorities are unsure whether visitors still inside are
hostages or are there to support and protect the rebels.
   Negotiations with the prisoners, who took over the Pavon prison
farm on Easter Sunday, came to a standstill Tuesday. The inmates
were told to lay down their arms and let the civilians leave or
face the cutoff of food, water and power.
   ``We're at an impasse,'' the Rev. Antonio Lopez Martin, chaplain
of Guatemalan prisons said late Tuesday. Lopez is part of the
delegation negotiating with the inmates at the facility outside
Guatemala City.
   The bodies of four guards and three inmates who were killed in
Sunday's takeover have been recovered, authorities said. Five
others are believed dead, said prison spokesman Conrado Monroy, but
their bodies have not been found on the grounds of the
2{-square-mile prison, Guatemala's largest.
   About 20 inmates not among the rebels were transported to
another prison on Tuesday. They were seen leaving the prison,
handcuffed by twos. Another half dozen visitors who had been inside
since Sunday also made their way out.
   Most of the prison's 1,350 inmates were not involved in the
rebellion, officials said. The facility is designed to house 800
people.
   The prison seizure resulted from a frustrated escape attempt,
authorities said, when inmates commandeered about 75 M-1 rifles and
ammunition from the prison arsenal.
   About 1,000 army and police troopers were stationed around the
facility. But President Vinicio Cerezo has said force will not be
used unless the inmates try to shoot their way out.
   The rebels have demanded amnesty for crimes committed since
Sunday, reduced sentences, better food and treatment and removal of
the facility's current authorities.
   The main sticking point in negotiations appears to be the
government's inability or unwillingness to guarantee amnesty for
crimes committed during the rebellion.
   The government has offered not to harm inmates involved in the
uprising and says it will intercede on their behalf before the
Supreme Court, the only authority constitutionally empowered to
award pardons.
   Most of the rebels were serving terms of up to 30 years for
murder, kidnapping and other felonies.

<HEAD>Man Slashes 10 Paintings in Museum</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DORDRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man with a large knife today
slashed 10 17th century Dutch paintings, including several by
pupils of Rembrandt, a museum official said.
   ``It is an enormous disaster,'' spokesman Willem de Paus said of
the incident at the Dordrechts Museum in this western city.
   The attacker, a 61-year-old unemployed man who was not
identified in line with Dutch judicial practice, was being held by
police in nearby Papendrecht. Works by Albert Cuyp, Nicolaas Maes,
Ferdinand Bol, Jacobus Levecc, and Jan Victors were damaged in the
attack.
   ``He was apparently very frustrated that he was out of work, and
he wanted to vent his anger,'' De Paus told The Associated Press in
a telephone interview.
   Among the damaged paintings are a 1656 family group by Bol, a
self-portrait from 1685 by Maes, and a conversion of Saulus done by
Cuyp in 1650, according to De Paus.
   The man entered the museum at about 1:45 p.m., said De Paus. He
inflicted ``very bad damage'' to 10 paintings on display in three
rooms before being spotted by a guard via a closed television
circuit, the spokesman said.
   Two guards tried to overpower the man, but he escaped by
threatening them with the knife, according to De Paus. He
surrendered later.
   ``They're really very heavily damaged. From some of them he cut
whole chunks, and others have large diagonal slashes,'' De Paus
said, adding that it was ``too early'' to establish whether the
paintings were beyond repair.
   He estimated the value of the paintings at ``many millions of
guilders (dollars).''
   In December, three paintings by Vincent van Gogh were stolen
from the Kroeller-Mueller museum in the eastern Netherlands. The
works were not recovered.
   In May, three paintings, among them a Van Gogh and a work by
French impressionist Paul Cezanne, were taken from Amsterdam's
Municipal Museum. They were found 11 days later.
   The incidents have raised grave doubts about security in Dutch
museums, where a government austerity drive has resulted in a
decrease in museum staffing.

   The nation's first
licensed, private spaceship blasted off into the morning sky today
on a suborbital flight lasting 15 minutes.
   The Consort 1 payload of scientific experiments went through
more than seven minutes of near weightlessness after the 8:42 a.m.
launch. The craft climbed 198 miles above Earth and landed about 50
miles north of the launch pad.
   ``We've been working a long time to put up a successful
launch,'' said a jubilant Bill Vance, vice president of finance and
administration for Space Service Inc., which launched the
commercial rocket. ``It's the first of many, and we think its a
real breakthrough.''
   Spectators cheered as the slender, white rocket shot into the
cloudless sky, leaving a white vapor trail.
   The 100 people who gathered 1{ miles from the launch pad didn't
hear the rocket's whoosh until it dropped its first stage, six
seconds and more than a mile into the flight. The rocket
disappeared from view in 25 seconds.
   The voyage was a small step by the standards of previous space
travel but a giant leap for the fledgling private spacecraft
industry, observers inside and outside the government believe.
   In the 1990s, private companies are expected to begin putting
satellites into orbit as the federal government gets out of the
business.
   The federal government began to realize the potential of the
private space industry after the successful September 1982 launch
of the Conestoga 1 rocket with a dummy payload from Matagorda
Island, Texas, officials said.
   But Space Services Inc., the Houston-based company responsible
for both the Conestoga and Consort rockets, had to deal with 18
federal agencies in its quest to fire Conestoga 1 because there was
no precedent for the flight.
   That prompted the federal government to assign the Department of
Transportation the task of licensing private launches and helping
cut red tape. The Consort 1 is the first commercial ship licensed
by the department.
   The government felt more pressure to foster private launches
after the disaster of the space shuttle Challenger in January 1986,
said Ray Whitten of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's office for commercial programs.
   The Transportation Department expects to process 10 launch
licenses this year, said Carol Lane, director of the agency's
commercial space transportation department.
   Five companies are offering launch services and Florida, Hawaii
and Virginia are considering offering private spaceports, she said.
   Space Services sees suborbital flights like the Consort 1 as
only a beginning and plans orbital flights in the future, spokesman
Mark Daniels said.
   ``The orbital business is where we'll make the big bucks,'' he
said.
   Consort 1 is estimated to cost $1 million to $2 million. Daniels
said he expects to see Space Services generate annual revenues of
$100 million to $500 million once it starts sending satellites into
orbit in the next decade.
   The Consort 1's 650-pound payload was assembled by the
University of Alabama-Huntsville's Consortium for Materials
Development in Space, one of 16 commercial development consortiums
sponsored by NASA.
   It includes experiments designed to measure how liquids mix in
weightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, how liquids coat
glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and how finely
powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce alloys.
   The experiments have applications in medicine, the manufacture
of metal alloys and in construction of space stations.
   Consort 1 was boosted into space by a modified Terrier Navy
rocket; the second stage is a Black Brant rocket. The entire
vehicle stands about 52 feet and weighs 6,000 pounds at liftoff.

<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III
acknowledged today that after twice urging Oliver North to tell the
truth, North withheld critical details about the diversion of Iran
arms sale money to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   Testifying at North's trial on 12 felony charges, Meese was
asked by prosecutor John Keker whether the White House national
security aide had mentioned the involvement of arms dealers Richard
Secord or Albert Hakim in the diversion.
   ``No sir,'' Meese replied when asked about Secord, then Hakim.
   Meese also acknowledged that North hadn't mentioned the role of
Swiss-based attorney Willard Zucker, who worked for Hakim and
Secord.
   The ex-attorney general also said North hadn't mentioned how the
price of the arms sold to Iran had been marked up by 270 percent,
with some of the excess going to the Contras.
   Meese said he told North he shouldn't conceal anything both at
the beginning of the interview and just before disclosing that he
knew of the diversion plan from a memo North prepared.
   Keker's questioning followed testimony Tuesday in which Meese
agreed with defense attorney Brendan Sullivan that the Nov. 23,
1986 interview was more like a ``chat'' between ``co-workers.''
   Today, Sullivan in his closing question to the former attorney
general made the point that North had told the truth on the central
point of the interview by telling Meese that the diversion had
occurred.
   North is charged with falsely telling Meese that the National
Security Council had no involvement with the diversion and that
Israel determined the amount of money funneled to the Contras. In
fact, North and other U.S. officials were directing the secret
operation.
   Meese testified Tuesday that his interview with North was part
of an ``administrative inquiry,'' not a criminal investigation.
   Under questioning by U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell,
Meese said North's obligation to answer questions was as a ``loyal
member of the administration'' and that he was under ``no legal
compulsion'' to do so.
   Meese agreed with Sullivan that the Reagan administration was
worried that the political fallout from the diversion could cause
``the toppling of the president himself.''
   Meese's discovery of the diversion came during a weekend inquiry
he conducted for Reagan. Earlier disclosure of the administration's
secret weapons sales to Iran had already produced an uproar.
   Meese, who informed President Reagan of the diversion on Nov.
24, 1986, said he didn't know if the word ``impeachment'' itself
was used in discussions, but that there was anxiety over ``the
tremendous consequences.''
   Meese said he was concerned that administration opponents might
get hold of the information and make it public, so he urged quick
action to limit the political damage. He held a news conference the
next day to announce the news.
   ``I felt it vital that there not be any appearance of a
coverup,'' said the former attorney general.
   North was fired and his boss, national security adviser John
Poindexter, resigned. Also, the Tower commission was created and
independent counsel Lawrence Walsh was appointed in December 1986.
   ``They were the actions taken because they were the appropriate
actions to take in any event,'' said Meese. ``But one of the
concerns was from preventing this from being used by political
opponents of the president.''
   Meese described interviewing North on Nov. 23, 1986, a Sunday,
seeking confirmation of a memo found the previous day at North's
National Security Council office. The memo by North outlined a plan
for the diversion.
   The NSC aide told Meese the diversion had already occurred from
an earlier arms shipment to Iran.
   ``Your worst nightmare had come true?'' North lawyer Brendan
Sullivan asked Meese.
   ``Yes,'' Meese replied.
   ``You knew that spelled trouble?'' asked Sullivan.
   ``Yes, I did,'' responded Meese.

   Retired Air Force Gen.
Richard H. Ellis, former commander in chief of the Strategic Air
Command, has died of cancer at age 69.
   Ellis, who died Tuesday at Malcolm Grove Medical Center, had a
35-year military career. After retirement, he was named in 1982 as
chief U.S. delegate to the U.S.-Soviet commission monitoring
compliance with arms control agreements.
   Ellis was SAC commander at Offutt Air Force Base in Bellevue,
Neb., from 1977 until his retirement in 1981.
   Born in Laurel, Del., Ellis began his active military career as
an aviation cadet in 1941. During World War II, he flew more than
200 combat missions in the western Pacific. He was made deputy
chief of staff of the Far East Air Forces in 1945.
   After the war, he returned to civilian life and earned a law
degree from the Dickinson School of Law in 1949. He was recalled to
active duty in 1950 during the Korean War.
   He was executive officer to the Air Force chief of staff from
1961 to 1963. Ellis was appointed vice commander in chief of U.S.
Air Forces in Europe in 1970 and vice chief of staff of the Air
Force in 1973.
   He is survived by his wife, Margaret, of McLean, Va.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan has reversed course and will take $215,000 in severance
pay from his previous job as a medical school president.
   Sullivan said in a statement released Tuesday evening by his
office that the severance, which was part of his contract as
president of the Morehouse School of Medicine, has been approved by
the Office of Government Ethics.
   ``I have made this agreement in the full faith that it in no way
presents ethical difficulty, or appearance of difficulty, with
regard to my services as HHS secretary,'' he said.
   Sullivan had previously decided to forgo the money because he
said he wanted to avoid even the appearance of potential conflicts
of interest with his connection to the medical school, which
receives federal grants. He said such questions could hamper his
effectiveness and damage Morehouse's image.
   Even though the Office of Government Ethics had informally
approved the severance pay as money earned before he came to the
federal government, Sullivan said he was concerned by news reports
at the time that raised conflict questions about his connection to
Morehouse.
   But his sacrifice raised concerns on Capitol Hill. Members of
Congress said that while his decision was admirable, they were
concerned it could set a precedent and discourage others from
taking government jobs.
   Indeed, Sullivan's announcement came one day after a New York
Times editorial also bade him to reconsider and take the money,
saying ``unjust sacrifice can weaken standards as much as lax
enforcement.''
   At the White House, press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said today
that President Bush was pleased by the decision. Fitzwater said a
Senate committee which reviewed Sullivan's nomination ``felt he was
entitled to some money so there was no question'' in terms of an
ethical problem.
   When Sullivan decided to forfeit the money, Bush was on the
defensive about ethics issues, with questions being raised about
then Defense Secretary-designate John Tower's relationships with
defense contractors, White House ethics chief C. Boyden Gray's
links to a communications corporation, Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Jack Kemp's acceptance of speaking fees
exceeding House limits, and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter's
acceptance of a lavish reception from a tobacco company.
   The secretary, the highest-ranking black in the Bush
administration, said in an interview earlier this month that he
would ``readily reverse'' his decision because ``I'm not a wealthy
man.'' Sullivan saw his annual pay drop from $172,000 last year to
$89,500 in his new job.
   He had said, however, that he would wait until the Senate
Finance Committee completed its review of the matter.
   Though the committee has not formally acted, the panel's staff
drafted a letter encouraging Bush to ``see to it that Dr. Sullivan
reconsiders his decision'' because ``we think others will be
influenced by what he has done,'' said a committee source who spoke
on the condition of anonymity.
   With Sullivan's reversal, the wording of the letter _ to be
signed by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, committee chairman, and Sen.
Bob Packwood, R-Ore., ranking member _ would probably be changed to
support the secretary's change of heart, the source said.
   Sullivan earlier had said the severance clause in his contract
entitled him to $297,000. HHS spokesman Campbell Gardett said the
$215,000 agreed to by Sullivan and the medical school ``was an
amount he felt was fair for him and Morehouse.''
   Sullivan is taking an unpaid leave of absence as a professor of
medicine at the medical school, which he founded.
   Earlier, he had asked the White House for permission to take a
paid sabbatical from the school, but the request was denied because
Morehouse's sabbatical policy did not meet the federal government's
standards.
   The White House was concerned the school did not apply its
sabbatical policy uniformly, which could make it appear that the
school, while receiving federal money, was illegally subsidizing
the pay of a federal official.

   A lawyer well-versed, no doubt, in Oliver
Wendell Holmes and John Marshall cited that great legal authority
``Mister Ed'' in getting drunken driving charges dismissed against
his horse-riding client.
   ``A horse is a horse, of course, of course,'' attorney Irving
Bloom told Magistrate Denise S. Thiel, who agreed that a horse is
not in the motor vehicle code.
   Ronald Nestor, 34, of Fairfield, was charged with drunken
driving and driving without lights after he and the Arabian
appaloosa he was riding were struck from behind by a pickup truck
Dec. 11.
   Police said Nestor's blood alcohol level at the time was 0.11,
just above the legal limit of 0.10.
   The horse was killed, and Nestor required 15 stitches above his
eye. The truck driver was not seriously hurt.

<HEAD>Move Over, Goodyear Blimp: Soviets Selling Ads on its Rockets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies tired of using blimps and
billboards for their advertising might want to hitch their products
to a star _ a red star.
   The Swiss advertising agency Punto S.A. has signed a deal with
the Soviets to find Western firms who want to plug their products
via the Sovet space program.
   Andrea Capra said Tuesday he signed a contract with Soviet
authorities in October to sell advertising space on their
spaceships, launch pads and cosmonaut uniforms.
   An official at the Soviet trade mission in Bern confirmed that
the Soviets were working with the Bienne-based firm. ``There were
negotiations last year which ended in success,'' said the Soviet
official, who asked not to be identified.
   The main exposure would be on the ground at space launches,
which the Soviets have indicated they want to open increasingly to
Western TV crews, Capra said. The footage could be shown on TV as
part of international news coverage or used later for publicity
purposes, he added.
   Advertising would likely be painted on rocket sections, which
fall into the sea after launching, he said. But under the accord,
cosmonauts also could wear publicity stickers on their in-flight
suits ``like Formula One'' racers.
   A prime ``billboard'' would be the Mir manned space station,
which has space for two company or product logos, Capra said.
   ``We're in concrete negotiations with three multinationals,''
Capra said. He declined to identify the companies.
   The first Soviet space shot with advertising could take place as
early as this fall, he said. He said he launched the idea ``because
it simply seemed more original than advertising on American space
shuttles.''

   The wife of one of China's most famous jailed
dissidents has not been allowed to see him for more than three
years and says he has been forced to sleep on bricks in a
mosquito-infested cell.
   Kang Tong said the last time she visited Xu Wenli, his teeth
were falling out, his hair had turned white and the skin hung loose
on his face. Xu is 46.
   She keeps a crumpled piece of paper in her coat pocket with the
date she last saw her husband: Oct. 10, 1985.
   Her daughter, Xu Jin, a 16-year-old with a pony tail and pink
cheeks, doesn't need the reminder; she knows the date by heart.
   Despite regulations guaranteeing inmates one visit a month, no
relatives have seen Xu since 1985. Still, from the six or seven
letters that are allowed to be sent every year, they know he's
alive.
   ``We both just want him home,'' Kang said in an interview this
week. ``Our family needs a husband's help and a father's love.''
   An electrician by profession, Xu was jailed in 1981 and
sentenced to 15 years for ``counterrevolutionary activities.'' His
crimes included taking part in the Democracy Wall Movement of 1978
during which he published an unsanctioned periodical calling for
political change.
   In his mimeographed journal, April 5th Forum, Xu argued a
multiparty system was not anti-Marxist and would help the socialist
cause.
   The movement was tolerated by China's new leader, Deng Xiaoping,
until he consolidated his power. Then came the crackdown.
   Since January, more and more Chinese intellectuals have begun
calling for the release of political prisoners such as Xu and Wei
Jingsheng, who was arrested 10 years ago Wednesday for helping lead
the democracy movement. The government says no release is planned
and denies it holds political prisoners.
   Kang remembers well her October 1985 visit to the Beijing No. 1
Prison.
   Xu came to the window wearing his black prison overalls, No. 001
stitched to his shirt pocket.
   ``His hair was almost all white and his skin was loose on his
face. His teeth were all rotting. It was pitiful to know that this
man was once a free man,'' she said.
   Soon thereafter, an essay by Xu was smuggled out of prison.
Titled ``My Self-Defense,'' Xu gave details of his arrest and
prosecution.
   Without explanation, Kang was not allowed any more visits.
   ``I wrote to the jail, I went to the jail to plead to see my
husband but they wouldn't let me,'' she said. ``They told me that I
knew the reason.''
   In May 1986, Kang needed to consult with her husband about an
experimental operation planned for their daughter's left leg, but
the prison refused.
   Miss Xu went herself to plead with the warden, but he turned her
down.
   ``He said, `Go ask your mother the reason why,''' said the girl,
who has since undergone two operations and hopes to have her cast
removed in May.
   After the essay was smuggled out, life became increasingly
difficult for Xu, his wife said, citing his letters and reports
from sympathetic friends with sources in the jail:
   Prison authorities moved him from an 86-square-foot room to a
43-square-foot cell. Guards took away his bed and forced him to
sleep on bricks. Lights were kept on constantly. In the winter, he
froze. In the summer, he was ravaged by mosquitoes because the
prison refused to accept the netting his wife sent.
   Family packages are returned.
   ``Every Spring Festival holiday, I'd go to the jail and wait at
the gate with a bundle for him,'' Kang said. ```No way, if that's
for Xu Wenli,' the guards said.''
   There have been small joys, however.
   Miss Xu's school is just blocks from the jail, and when the wind
was right he could hear the students singing.
   ``Today you had a singing competition at school,'' Xu wrote in
one letter. ``I thought I heard your voice.''
   ``The next time, I sang extra hard for him,'' Miss Xu said.
   But Kang soon took her daughter from the school because the sons
and daughters of many of the prison guards taunted her. ``Even my
teacher kept asking me if my papa had come home,'' Miss Xu said.
``One day, I told him `yes' and he scolded me for lying.''
   Kang said recent letters indicate Xu's treatment has improved
somewhat. He is using paper she sent him and acknowledges receipt
of their letters. The prison also allowed him to write to his
mother.
   ``He doesn't know she died in 1987,'' Kang said. ``I won't tell
him because I'm afraid it will hurt him so.''
   Kang, a teacher in a business school, said she and her daughter
were getting by OK on her monthly salary of around 100 yuan, about
$27.
   ``The real problem is with our spirits,'' she said, ``always
dreaming of something that never happens. It leaves us empty
sometimes.''
   Kang said her husband did nothing to deserve his punishment.
   ``All he did was talk,'' she said. ``It's such a brutal thing to
do to a man, just for a few words.''

<HEAD>South Korean President Takes Tough Line Against Opponents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One year into his term, President Roh
Tae-woo has started to take a tough line against opponents, calling
off a referendum on his performance and cracking down on both
dissidents and government hardliners.
   Roh, who has tried to follow moderate policies and portray
himself as a populist, has not gained firm control of South Korea's
turbulent politics. But the former general shows no sign of trying
to backtrack on democratic reforms despite cracking down on the
opposition he faces from the left and the right.
   While there are no signs that Roh could lose power, South
Korea's chronic political unrest is likely to continue as the
nation struggles to adjust to a democratic system after decades of
authoritarian rule.
   Roh said radical groups were plotting to stage a violent leftist
revolution when he stunned the nation March 20 by indefinitely
postponing a referendum on his performance. A referendum would lead
to political chaos, he said.
   ``The people are worried. Leftist forces are trying to ...
overthrow the free democratic system,'' Roh told the nation.
   He ordered police to suppress the often violent demonstrations
staged by radical students, strikers, farmers and other groups. A
government report said there were more than 7,000 protests in 1988.
   The government vowed further action after top dissident Moon
Ik-hwan made a secret visit March 25 to communist North Korea for
talks on reuniting the two nations. Enraged officials said
dissidents were trying to aid North Korea.
   Some political analysts said Roh called off the referendum
because he feared he could not win, and a defeat probably would
have forced the government to call new presidential elections.
   ``If Roh could have been sure of winning there is no reason he
would not have gone ahead and swept away any doubt about his right
to be president,'' said an administration source, who declined to
be named.
   Roh, who won presidential elections in December 1987 with 36
percent of the vote, is mistrusted by people suspicious of his
close ties to former authoritarian President Chun Doo-hwan. Many
Koreans, however, are tired of politics after years of upheaval and
don't want new instability, analysts say.
   Roh has shielded Chun against opposition demands the former
president be made to account for corruption and human rights abuses
under his rule. The two took power with military backing in 1980.
   Dissidents and radical students who have called for Roh's ouster
are not seen as a major threat despite frequent violent
demonstrations, most analysts say, because the radicals lack
significant public support do to their extremism and violence.
   The United National Democratic Movement, a new dissident
alliance that claims Roh is a front for military rule, has failed
to gain strong public support, and turnout for its rallies has been
small.
   Roh ordered a crackdown on the radicals after criticism from
conservatives about the administration's failure to end violent
protests. ``Hardliners in the military have voiced strong concern
over the way Roh has handled leftists and violent laborers and
students,'' said political analyst Park Moo-jong.
   The main opposition parties also have not played a big role. The
two main opposition parties headed by Kim Dae-jung and Kim
Young-sam remain locked in a bitter rivalry that reduces their
ability to work against the government.
   Roh also has started to move against hardliners within the
government and military who have been critical of his moderate
policies and worried that he may not be able to maintain public
order.
   Government officials said Wednesday that hardline generals in
key posts were being retired or moved to lesser posts in a shakeup
involving 49 generals. The military, which took power twice in the
past, has been a major political force in South Korea's 40 year
history.
   The government reportedly is divided into moderates loyal to Roh
and rival hardliners unhappy that rapid democratic reforms are
threatening their hold on power and allowing opposition groups to
flourish, causing social unrest.
   Roh is seeking ties with communist nations to ease tension with
North Korea; hardliners are clinging to the anti-communism that
dominated South Korean policy for decades.
   Roh moved against his hardline critics after a series of
incidents showed right wing opposition within the government was
growing.
   Cabinet minister Kim Yong-kap, regarded as the leading hardliner
in Roh's government, resigned in March to protest what he said was
a growing threat from leftists. ``I turned in my resignation to
give a warning to people against the worsening political
situation,'' the former general said.

   The Coast Guard searched Wednesday for a
cruise liner crewman who jumped overboard with a life jacket, then
refused all rescue attempts and swam away.
   Nathaniel Francis, 27, who had been hired only Tuesday to work
on the Cunard Princess, disappeared overboard 2 a.m. Wednesday,
said Coast Guard spokesman Joe Dye.
   ``We haven't a clue'' why, Dye said. ``But he did don a life
jacket first.''
   The Princess launched a small boat to rescue Francis, Dye said.
   ``They threw out a life ring, but he avoided it,'' he said.
``Apparently he kept swiming underwater, trying to avoid all
attempts to rescue him.''
   About 7 a.m. the would-be rescuers lost sight of Francis, and
Coast Guard helicopters and a cutter began searching about 10 miles
south of Marathon.
   Neither Francis nor his life jacket was spotted again by
afternoon, the Coast Guard said.

   President Bush said today he will send
Congress ``in the next few days'' his recommendations for pay
raises for top federal officials, members of Congress and judges.
   Bush made the commitment as the private National Commission on
Public Service suggested pay raises for federal officials virtually
as high as the increases that Congress killed in February.
   Neither Bush nor White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
indicated what Bush's recommendation would be.
   ``This is very timely,'' the president told members of the
commission, which is headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker. ``In the next few days, I'll be making some very specific
proposals.''
   Fitzwater reiterated to reporters Bush's view that there should
be pay raises for federal executives, judges and members of
Congress, although he said no decisions had been made about
recommendations to Capitol Hill.
   Fitzwater said that in the meeting, Bush had pointed out that
``it was important for the president to speak out and to set a tone
and prevent a morale problem in the civil service.'' But the
spokesman also said ``I'm not aware of a morale problem.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, however, said he considered it
unlikely that members of Congress would be willing to consider
another pay raise this year.
   ``Will something get done this year? I doubt it,'' said Coelho,
D-Calif., in a telephone interview. ``Something needs to be done
but I'm not at all optimistic.''
   The private study panel headed by Volcker today recommended pay
increases of approximately 50 percent over two years for these
federal officials.
   The pay increases suggested by Volcker's commission roughly
parallel those called for by a congressionally created panel and
endorsed by Bush as well as his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   Those increases were rejected by Congress in the face of intense
public criticism centering on the proposed pay raise for the
lawmakers.
   The private commission also recommended that Congress prohibit
its members from receiving speaking honoraria and other outside
income related to their public responsibilities, saying that
otherwise the increase would be more likely to be ``perceived by
the American people as excessive.''
   ``Not only does such income create lingering doubts about the
need for an across-the-board increase, but it also undermines
public trust in national institutions,'' the panel said.
   The commission, which includes former President Gerald R. Ford
and former Vice President Walter F. Mondale among its 36 members,
also suggested pay increases for lower-ranking government workers.
   It recommended that these raises be phased in and the cost of
them absorbed through reductions in employment or the elimination
of government programs. The commission recommended that pay for
civil service workers be varied depending on the cost of living in
different parts of the country.
   Volcker said that based on talks with some members of Congress,
``I do find some renewal of interest in the subject'' of pay
increases.
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., a member of the commission, said he
detected on Capitol Hill ``a feeling that something needs to be
done in all areas.''
   But he said some lawmakers strongly oppose the commission's
recommendation that speaking honoraria for lawmakers be outlawed
and that their salaries perhaps be considered separately from those
of judges and executive branch officials.
   ``Don't underestimate a few committed souls,'' Robb said.
   Douglas Fraser, former president of the United Automobile
Workers and a member of the commission, said that organized labor
generally supports the commission's report, but disagrees with the
proposal that pay vary from locality to locality. ``It creates in
many cases gross inequalities,'' Fraser said.
   George King, director of public relations for the National
Treasury Employees Union, said the commission's report ``really
doesn't address the lower-grade or rank-and-file federal
employees.''
   ``It holds out the false hope that pay increases for these
people can be absorbed in current agency budgets or through
reductions in force,'' King said.
   He said that his organization, which claims to represent 144,000
federal workers, seeks annual pay raises of 6 percent, or 3 percent
above inflation, whichever is larger, and advocates
agency-by-agency bargaining.
   The commission was formed after a conference held in Washington
in 1987 by the liberal Brookings Institution and the conservative
American Enterprise Institute.
   It reported that the purchasing power of executive, judicial and
legislative salaries has fallen by 35 percent since 1969 and
recommnded that they be restored to the 1969 purchasing power
level. This would require an increase of about 50 percent.
   The commission recommended that 25 percent of the increase be
granted now and the rest by the beginning of the new Congress in
1991. If Congress is unable to act on its own salaries, even though
they are phased in and accompanied by a ban on speaking fees, the
commission recommended that the president submit separate pay
raises for judges and senior executives.
   If increases for senior political employees are delayed, the
president and Congress should raise a current limit on top-level
career employees even if this means that they make more than the
political appointees who are above them, the commission said.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh today said
127 people have been charged in investigation he said smashed a
billion-dollar international money-laundering ring with links to
the Medellin drug cartel of Colombia.
   Thornburgh called it ``the largest money-laundering crackdown
ever carried out by the federal government.''
   Authorities seized a half-ton of cocaine and $45 million in
cash, jewelry and real estate, and have identified more assets for
potential seizure, he said.
   ``There is no more effective way to deal with the business of
drug trafficking than to take the profit out of it. That's what has
happened with Operation Polar Cap,'' Thornburgh said at a news
conference.
   Federal authorities also obtained conspiracy indictments against
two South American banks, Banco de Occidente of Panama and Banco de
Occidente of Colombia, on charges they were involved in laundering
more than $1 billion in drug proceeds generated in the United
States.
   Appearing with Thornburgh was FBI Director William Sessions,
Drug Enforcement Administrator John Lawn and other federal
authorities. Lawn said the sophisticated and complicated
money-laundering operation laundered $1.2 billion in two years.
   Thornburgh called it ``a very hostile takeover of a major
money-laundering operation.''
   Lawn said federal investigators in Atlanta were told by
drug-world leaders that the money-laundering scheme they were
operating undercover was processing the money too slowly and
described a faster Los Angeles-based operation that could launder
their money in 48 hours.
   He said it was called ``La Mina,'' or ``The Mine,'' and that
authorities began investigating that operation. He said it involved
transfers of drug-proceeds and laundered money through several
cities and Panama, Colombia and Uruguay.
   The Justice Department said that among the indictments resulting
from the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealed
today in Atlanta and eight people arrested Tuesday evening in New
York.
   Bruce Pagel, an attorney in the department's narcotics section,
said most of the 127 people charged in the investigation had been
arrested but that authorities were still pursuing some.
   The department said the Atlanta indictment traces the
establishment of the money-laundering enterprise directly to
leaders of the Colombian Medellin cartel, which authorities say is
the source of 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in this country.
   Federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in Atlanta, Miami,
New York and San Francisco, and additional arrests were expected in
New York, Los Angeles and Miami, the department said.
   Thornburgh said there was no evidence of illegal activity by
U.S. banks, and that the banks cooperated in the investigation.
   Lawn said authorities also hoped to make an arrest today in
Panama with the help of the Panamanian Defense Forces. Thornburgh
said federal authorities continued to cooperate with the force,
despite the pending federal drug indictment against Panamanian
leader Manuel Noriega.

<TEXT>
   A new tabloid hits the streets this fall,
offering St. Louis the prospect of an old-fashioned newspaper war.
   The established paper already has served notice it won't concede
so much as one reader to the upstart.
   Ralph Ingersoll II on Tuesday announced plans for a ``visually
dynamic'' paper called the St. Louis Sun. He said it will be
published seven mornings a week and will be competitive with the
111-year-old St. Louis Post-Dispatch from day one.
   ``The Sun will be profitable in the second year of its
operation, and it will continue to grow,'' he predicted. Ingersoll
Publications Co. publishes more than 40 daily newspapers and more
than 150 non-daily papers in the United States and Europe.
   The Post-Dispatch, owned by the Pulitzer family since its
inception, has been the city's only daily newspaper since the St.
Louis Globe-Democrat folded under financial strain in 1986.
   ``Competition is the way of life in the American system,'' said
Joseph Pulitzer Jr., Post-Dispatch chairman. But he added, ``We'll
beat the pants off them.''
   Ingersoll, chairman and chief executive of Ingersoll
Publications, will start his venture with the help of a top
Post-Dispatch executive, who resigned from that paper Tuesday
morning. Thomas M. Tallarico, 44, a senior vice president and
general manager of the Post-Dispatch since 1986, will be publisher
of the Sun.
   ``The Post-Dispatch's mission will remain the same, as will its
character,'' said Editor William F. Woo. ``Competition focuses,
competition sharpens and competition quickens. All of those things
are good _ for newspapers or any other business. But I am not
prepared to concede one single reader to Ralph Ingersoll.''
   Ingersoll would not divulge start-up costs but said the first
run of the newspaper will be 200,000 copies. He said the newspaper
could be profitable with a circulation of fewer than 100,000.
   Weekday paid circulation for the Post-Dispatch is about 378,000
with 554,000 copies on Sundays.
   ``It has been an old saw that big cities can really only have
one successful newspaper,'' Mayor Vincent C. Schoemehl Jr. said.
``I think a new sense of competitiveness, new technology and a new
aggressiveness in the media industry makes that old saw sawdust.''
   ``It can only help to have another public voice,'' said Charles
Klotzer, editor of the St. Louis Journalism Review. ``The big thing
is, are they going to get the big advertisers? But as a whole, it's
very encouraging.''

   Buses and trains ran on schedule
Wednesday as transportation workers ended a one-day strike for
higher wages that snarled traffic in Brazil's second-largest city.
   Workers agreed to a 20 percent salary increase and six-hour
shifts within four months, said Luis Martins, president of the Bus
Workers Union. They had demanded a 30 percent wage rise in addition
to the reduced shift.
   Employees of the government-run commuter trains returned to work
without winning their demands for a six-hour shift and bonus pay.
But Luis Barreto, director of the Train Workers Union, said
negotiations would continue Wednesday.
   The strikes stranded more than 5 million commuters Tuesday and
caused major traffic jams throughout the city.

   Federal regulators said Wednesday they had
seized control of most of MCorp, an $18 billion, Dallas-based bank
holding company, pumping in $300 million in what will likely become
the third largest commercial bank rescue ever.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. packaged 20 MCorp subsidiary
banks into a new, government-owned institution with $15.4 billion
in assets and $11.6 billion in deposits. Left alone were five
still-solvent subsidiary banks and a trust company.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the FDIC, which insures
commercial bank deposits up to $100,000, said the agency will seek
buyers for the new institution.
   He declined to estimate how much government aid will ultimately
be required, saying he did not want to reveal the figure to
potential bidders.
   Private analysts have said they expect the failure will cost the
FDIC, already depleted by a post-Depression record of 221 bank
failures last year, $1 billion to $2 billion.
   That would make the transaction the third most costly commercial
bank rescue, after Continental Illinois of Chicago in 1984 and
First RepublicBank of Dallas in 1988, which required initial
government pledges of $4.5 billion and $4 billion, respectively.
Both, like MCorp, were holding companies.
   The FDIC insurance fund suffered its first loss ever in 1988,
declining from $18.3 billion to $14 billion. Seidman said the fund
should break even this year, even with spending for MCorp.
   As part of legislation to bail out the savings and loan
industry, President Bush is proposing to build up the commercial
bank insurance fund by nearly doubling the deposit insurance
premium paid by banks.
   Earlier this year, when the FDIC was trying to sell MCorp in its
entirety, the agency had set an April 3 deadline for offers, but
Seidman said that may be extended.
   ``We are going to proceed with the sale as promptly as
possible,'' he said.
   In Dallas, MCorp said the five remaining banks and the trust
subsidiary ``form the nucleus of a new beginning for MCorp,'' which
intends to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   ``While the nature of MCorp has been altered dramatically, a
solid, healthy core remains,'' Chairman Gene H. Bishop said.
   Seidman said the failed banks opened for business today and ``as
far as the customers are concerned it will be business as usual.''
   MCorp, which has 86 offices, lost $903 million from its banking
operations last year. It is the last of the large Texas banks
needing to be recapitalized, either through federal rescue or
private merger. The bulk of the assets were in the subsidiaries in
Dallas, $6.4 billion, and Houston, $3.2 billion.
   Until last year, many analysts had thought MCorp, which had not
invested as heavily in energy projects as other Texas banks, might
survive. But heavy losses on real estate loans evenutally dragged
it under.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, the chief regulator
of nationally chartered banks, said the failures were triggered by
demands beginning Monday on the lead bank in Dallas, both from
depositors and from the other banks in the holding company.
   On Tuesday, ``it became clear as the day wore on that the
(Dallas) bank was not going to be able to meet the demands of
depositors,'' Clarke said. Five of the banks had been insolvent on
their; 15 more failed after the Dallas bank could not meet their
demands for deposits. The demands of all outside customers were
met, he said.
   Federal action was complicated by the fact that regulators
legally could not take control of the five MCorp subsidiary banks
that remain solvent. A legal battle is developing between private
creditors and the FDIC over assets held by the holding company.
   Regulators claim holding company assests should be used to defer
federal costs in rescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks, but MCorp
has resisted.
   Seidman declined to say how large the claim against the holding
company is except that it is ``substantial.'' The insurance fund
last year had been trying to force the holding company to inject
$400 million into 18 of its banks.
   For future cases, the FDIC is seeking legislation from Congress
that would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back up
sister institutions that fail.
   The FDIC's move came a week after creditors of MCorp forced it
to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
The holding company had halted payments on $466 million in debt
last October but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing their
claims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement with
the FDIC.
   The FDIC appointed James Gardner, chairman of MBank Dallas, as
president of its new government-owned institution. The agency said
it will seek a new chairman from outside the MCorp system.
   Reportedly among those interested in buying MCorp is A. Robert
Abboud, chairman of Houston's First City Bancorporation, which was
itself rescued by the FDIC in 1987 with $1 billion.
   Other likely bidders are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the
Pritzker family of Chicago and a group led by Harry Gray, former
chairman of United Technologies Corp.
   The 20 MCorp banks seized are MBank Abilene, MBank Alamo, MBank
Austin, MBank Brenham, MBank Corsicana, MBank Dallas, MBank Denton
County, MBank Fort Worth, MBank Greenville, MBank Houston, MBank
Jefferson, MBank Longview, MBank Marshall, MBank Midcities, MBank
Odessa, MBank Orange, MBank Round Rock, MBank Sherman, MBank
Wichita Falls and MBank The Woodlands.
   The five banks remaining solvent are MBank Brownsville, MBank
Corpus Christi, MBank Waco, MBank El Paso and MBank New Braunfels.
A sixth subsidiary, MTrust Corp., also remains solvent.

<HEAD>Drop in Economic Forecasting Gauge Adds to Evidence of Slowdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Wednesday that its
chief economic forecasting gauge dropped 0.3 percent in February,
corroborating other signs of a slowdown in the economic expansion.
   Last month's decline in the Index of Leading Economic
Indicators, a composite of forward-looking business statistics, was
matched by a comparable dip last September and was the biggest drop
since a fall of 0.8 percent last July.
   Analysts said February's decline was consistent with other
recent signals that the economy may be losing steam _ welcome news
to those who say growth must slow in order to keep inflation from
spiraling.
   ``This should reduce concern about the economy overheating,
while the decline is not sharp enough to give any signal of a
recession,'' said Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist for the
National Association of Manufacturers.
   Others, however, are concerned that the economy will slow too
much and that the Federal Reserve Board's yearlong campaign to
raise interest rates and dampen inflationary pressures will stifle
growth altogether.
   ``The monetary tightening that we have experienced and some
monetary tightening that is probably still to come are going to
cause a downturn,'' said economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch
&amp; Co. in New York. ``I think that we're going to have a recession
by the end of the year.''
   Steinberg said Fed policy-makers are ``doing what they have to
do'' to cure inflation, with a recession likely to be the
unintended side effect.
   Last month's drop in the leading index added to a series of
government reports on the economy's performance in February that
pointed downward, including decreases in manufacturing employment,
housing construction and orders for durable goods.
   In other evidence of a weakening economy, the Commerce
Department reported Wednesday that sales of new, single-family
homes in February plunged 9.4 percent to their lowest level in more
than a year.
   Analysts blame the slow sales pace on the pinch of higher
mortgage interest rates which forced some lower-income buyers out
of the market.
   ``The first people forced out of the market in times of rising
rates are first-time buyers who barely qualify to buy a home,''
said John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of
Realtors.
   The leading index, designed to foretell economic activity six to
nine months into the future, had advanced 0.6 percent in December
and 0.7 percent in January after vacillating during much of 1988.
   Economist John Hagens of the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
said the latest decline in the index was not enough evidence to
signal a future recession, but is ``consistent with our view that
we are going to have a period of prolonged slowing of growth
beginning in the second half of this year and carrying through the
first half of next year.''
   Whether the slowdown turns into a recession will depend on how
deftly the Fed maneuvers as it tries to slow growth just enough to
bring inflation under control, Hagens said.
   In February, eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading
index declined, with the biggest negative factor being a drop in
manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment.
   The other negative factors were a drop in building permits, a
decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a contraction
in the money supply, a dip in an index of consumer expectations, an
increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits, faster vendor
deliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline in
manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   Two indicators made positive contributions: an increase in
prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand, and rising
stock prices. One indicator was unchanged last month: the length of
the average work week.
   The various changes left the index at 145.2 percent of its 1982
base of 100.
   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater noted that the index stands 3.5 percent ahead of where it
was a year ago, adding: ``One month's figures don't provide a real
basis for judging any change in that trend.''
   The traditional signal of an oncoming recession is three
straight declines in the leading index. The components of the
composite index were revised last month to improve its forecasting
abilities, but when the new index is applied retroactively, it
flashes two false recession signals since the last economic
downturn in 1981-82.

   Poor inner-city schools are ``war zones'' in
which little works but police action, says Joe Clark, who
brandished a baseball bat to keep students in line at his Eastside
High School in New Jersey.
   Clark, principal at the school in Paterson, was carrying the
trademark bat when he appeared Tuesday for a speech at Wayne State
University.
   ``A person would have to be crazy'' to become Detroit's next
public school superintendent, Clark said. Superintendent Arthur
Jefferson has announced his retirement in June from the nation's
sixth-largest public school system.
   Clark, portrayed in the hit feature film ``Lean On Me,'' is on
sabbatical while officials investigate an incident earlier this
month, in which male strippers performed for a student assembly.
   Clark said he thrives on controversy.
   ``I'm just like a tea bag,'' he said. ``You can tell how strong
a person is when you put him in hot water.''

   Readers of a popular Soviet weekly have named
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ``Man of the Year'' in a poll that
also showed most of them think a new world war is next to
impossible.
   The Tass news agency said Wednesday that more than 200,000
readers responded to the Literaturnaya Gazeta poll on ``Soviet
society's burning social and economic problems.''
   According to Tass, nearly 80 percent considered world war
impossible or highly improbable, and 71 percent strongly favored
the cuts in military spending ordered by Gorbachev.
   Readers of the weekly, with a 6.3 million circulation, described
the Soviet military withdrawal from Afghanistan, completed Feb. 15,
as the ``Event of the Year,'' Tass said.

   Actor Paul Newman is finding it harder to
rid himself of an irksome lawsuit than it was to handle Jackie
Gleason in a game of straight pool.
   Westport delicatessen owner Julius Gold sued Newman and his
partners, claiming they promised him an 8 percent share of the
actor's food company, Newman's Own.
   The 18-day trial ended in a mistrial in July, and the judge
refused to grant a request by Newman's lawyer that the lawsuit be
dismissed.
   Newman went to the state Appellate Court, which ruled that he
could not appeal because there had been no jury verdict.
   On Wednesday, a lawyer for the star of ``The Hustler'' and
dozens of other films was in the Connecticut Supreme Court, once
again seeking dismissal of the lawsuit. The court took the request
under advisement.

   The Western, which seemed to have choked
dust on the parched plains of late-night reruns, is making a
mini-comeback, says John Ireland, the poker-faced gunfighter who
starred in many of the old films.
   ``Time was,'' said Ireland, ``when you'd see a guy on one
channel saying, `Put 'em up,' and could change channels and another
guy would answer him.''
   But people lost interest in the 1950s cowboy series' such as
``Rawhide,'' ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Wagon Train,'' when out of the West
came the police show.
   Cops do most of the TV killing of bad guys these days, Ireland
said, but the popularity of the miniseries ``Lonesome Dove'' and a
recent movie based on television's ``Bonanza'' indicate a rebirth
is occurring.
   Ireland, 75, is one of the featured guests at the fourth annual
``Riders of the Silver Screen,'' a three-day celebration beginning
Thursday in Knoxville.
   Events include old Western movie showings, a re-created gunfight
at the 1982 World's Fair site and a Western star look-alike contest.
   Ireland had major roles in ``Gunfight at the OK Corral'' and
``Red River,'' among others. Recently he appeared in Charles
Bronson's ``Messenger of Death'' and assumed the role of Ben
Cartwright for the TV movie, ``Bonanza.''

<HEAD>IRS Says Half of Americans Still Haven't Filed Tax Returns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Heading into the final three weeks of the tax
preparation season, more than half of Americans still had not
mailed their tax returns, the Internal Revenue Service said
Wednesday.
   Through last Friday, the IRS had received 53.1 million returns,
up 0.7 percent from 52.8 million during the same period a year ago.
The IRS expects 109 million individual returns will be filed this
year _ although several million of them will not come in by the
April 17 deadline.
   Nearly 32 million returns are expected in the final two weeks of
the season, but the IRS isn't worried about a crush. That
represents almost 30 percent of the total, about the same as in
past years, the agency said.
   While filings are up slightly, the IRS is processing returns 3.3
percent faster than a year ago. The agency said 42.4 million
returns have made their way through the system, compared with just
under 41.1 million during the same period last year.
   More than 74 percent of the processed returns have been
certified for refunds totaling $25.6 billion, an average refund of
almost $816. At this time last year, 75 percent of filers had
refunds approved; those refunds average $817.
   ``Refunds are still going out within six weeks, but those who
file closer to the deadline will probably have to wait longer for
their refund,'' the IRS said.
   The statistic that pleases IRS most is one showing that the
number of taxpayers filing returns electronically is more than
double last year's. Through March 23, the IRS had received 981,107
electronic returns, compared with 464,284 at the same time a year
ago.
   Electronic filing is available in most states this year but only
for returns that are due a refund. The return must be filed through
a professional preparer who has been licensed by the IRS.
   Such a return saves the IRS considerable paperwork and
processing expense and can produce a refund within two or three
weeks.
   Another trend that was spotted early this year is continuing:
fewer taxpayers are calling the IRS with specific tax questions. At
this time last year, the IRS toll-free phones had received 20.6
million calls; that is down to 19.3 million this year.
   The IRS has no way of knowing whether that dropoff was caused by
widespread publicity about the agency's high error rate in
answering questions, which in some areas has approached 50 percent.
   The number of taxpayers taking advantage of another type of
telephone assistance, Tele-Tax, exceeds 15 million this year,
compared with 5.4 million at this time a year ago.
   Tele-Tax, whose toll-free numbers and subject list are included
in the back of the instruction packages mailed by the IRS, offers
tape-recorded advice on more than 140 tax topics.

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fishermen in a mosquito fleet of small
vessels worked with booms, rakes and shovels to save their
livelihood today while accusing Exxon of botching the cleanup of
the nation's worst-ever oil spill.
   The last-ditch effort concentrated on the southwest portion of
once-pristine Prince William Sound. Fishermen said they hope to
protect important salmon hatcheries.
   One estimate put the season's losses at more than $150 million
as a result of the spill, which occurred Friday when the Exxon
Valdez ran onto a reef and leaked 240,000 barrels of the 1.2
million aboard the tanker.
   ``There is definitely a sense of hopelessness, that can't be
avoided,'' said Jack Lamb, acting president of the Cordova District
Fishermen United. ``Exxon did screw up, no doubt about it. But what
we're trying to do is maintain our focus and get this thing cleaned
up.
   ``Our feelings have to be set aside to get this cleaned up. Then
we can start dealing with the companies.''
   In Washington today, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
today cited ``good cooperation'' in the effort to stop the oil
slick in Prince William Sound and suggested a federal takeover of
the cleanup may not be necessary.
   Fitzwater said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner talked
with President Bush from Alaska and reported that ``things were
more positive than they might have believed.''
   Skinner is in Alaska with Adm. Paul Yost, commandant of the
Coast Guard; and William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency. Bush sent them because of conflicting reports on
whether Exxon was doing enough.
   Exxon was assisted by the state, the Coast Guard and local
fishermen in trying to clean up the slick and protect hundreds of
pristine islands in its path.
   Since the tanker ran aground Friday, the 10.1 million gallons of
crude oil have moved more than 40 miles, contaminating some beaches
and marine life in the wildlife-rich sound.
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi conceded earlier this
week that the cleanup ``is not proceeding well _ believe me, that
is an understatement. We've got a mess on our hands.''
   Gov. Steve Cowper today said Exxon's response to the spill was
so late and inadequate that authorities are losing hope of cleaning
up the mess.
   ``Just about all we can do is to act in specific areas. For
instance we're trying to save the hatchery areas,'' he said on
ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Cowper, a Democrat, said it was the oil company's legal duty to
respond first to the spill, ``and they didn't do a good job, to put
it charitably.''
   ``I think clearly in the beginning the response was very poor,''
he said. ``Then the weather got bad for a day or so. I think now
the effort's being coordinated farily well, but it's pretty late.''
   Mayor John Devens said, ``I think the hatcheries are saveable. I
think that's where the effort has to be placed now. ... We think
we've probably lost our herring season. We're likely to lose a good
bit of our salmon season. ... The value, just the fishing season is
going to be in excess of $150 million.''
   The San Diego Union, meanwhile, reported today that the Exxon
Valdez was built without a dual bottom, which can lessen the risk
of a puncture causing a leak.
   ``It's a question of economics. It's much cheaper to build a
single-skin ship,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Woody Loveland, who was the
Coast Guard's chief marine safety officer in San Diego when the
Valdez was built.
   Many tankers were constructed with protective hulls in
anticipation of regulations requiring them, Loveland said, but the
design feature was dropped for some ships when it became evident
such a requirement would not be enacted.
   Though industry sources agree that double bottoms prevent spills
under certain circumstances, their effectiveness remains open to
debate when ships run hard into rocks or other obstructions as the
Valdez apparently did.
   Richard S. Golob, publisher of Golob's Oil Pollution Bulletin,
said most tankers have single bottoms. ``A double bottom, although
it provides an additional level of safety, does not necessarily
provide a cure-all in the event of a major accident,'' he said.
   In the fishing village of Cordova, 50 miles to the southeast,
angry residents packed a high school gymnasium Tuesday night for a
meeting with state and Exxon officials. Many of the town's 2,500
residents had opposed using Valdez as the southern terminus for the
Alaskan pipeline.
   Resident Marla Adkins said the oil industry had promised to have
adequate equipment on hand to handle any spills.
   ``What happened here is not what we were told would happen 10
years ago,'' she said.
   Fisherman John Booren said he feared publicity about the spill
would destroy the market for the area's fish, even if the damage
were contained.

<TEXT>
   Students supporting a dissident's
visit to North Korea fought riot police in two cities Wedneday, and
the Seoul government accused its northern rival of inciting
communist revolution.
   Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo cautioned communist leaders in
the North Korean capital of Pyongyang against continuing contacts
with South Korean dissidents outside official channels.
   ``If North Korea continues to use our sincere effort toward
unification for anti-South Korea political manipulation, it will
not escape from all responsibility arising therefrom,'' he said.
   The Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, adviser to the dissident United National
Democratic Movement, arrived in Pyongyang on a secret visit
Saturday, violating the requirement for prior government approval.
   Thousands of students tried to march from campuses into the
streets of the southern cities of Taegu and Kwanju, and hundreds of
riot officers fired tear gas to stop them, police and withesses
said.
   Protesters shouted ``Unification!'' and ``Down with Roh
Tae-woo!''
   Lee accused North Korea of trying to undermine President Roh's
government by expanding contacts with South Korean dissidents, and
accused it of incidting communist revolution in the South.
   He issued the statement after Premier Kang Young-hoon and other
senior government and party officials met to discuss Moon's visit
to North Korea.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they agreed to continue efforts to ease tension on the divided
peninsula but would do so in a ``cautious'' manner. Roh's
government has tried to improve relations with North Korea and
increase trade with other communist nations.
   Moon, 71, arrived in Pyongyang by way of Japan and China. His
supporters say the visit opens a new phase in reunification efforts
and criticized prosecutors' plans to arrest him on his return home,
expected next week.
   Roh's government says dissidents are trying to undermine its
authority.
   About 5,000 students from 13 colleges gathered at Chonam
University in Kwangju to denounce the government and demand
reunification, said a report by the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   Another 5,000 students and workers attended a rally at Kyemyong
University in Taegu, where dissident leader Paek Ki-wan declared
that Moon went to North Korea to speak for farmers, workers and the
poor. Paek claimed the government was not interested in unification.
   Officials in Seoul said Moon, who met President Kim Il Sung of
North Korea on Monday, may face charges that could put him in
prison for 10 years.
   Seoul newspapers said the government may cancel a scheduled
April visit to North Korea by Chung Ju-yung, founder of the Hyundai
Group, one of South Korea's largest business conglomerates.
   Chung has been negotiating joint ventures with North Korea,
including a resort development in the Diamond Mountains on the east
coast. He visited Pyongyang in January with the permission of both
governments.
   The two nations have held a series of political and sports
talks, including a meeting Tuesday on a possible joint team for the
1990 Asian Games in Beijing.
   They remain technically at war and the border has been sealed
since the conflict of 1950-53, but government-level talks have been
held irregularly since the early 1970s.

   The National Museum decided not to borrow the mummies after a

Yub.
   However, pictures and information about the mummies will be

   The council told the museum the exhibition of embalmed bodies

   The jet, carrying 534 passengers and a crew of 15, suffered no
major damage, the official said.
   The plane had arrived from Kagoshima, 600 miles southwest of
Tokyo, the official said. He did not give its destination or say
whether the plane continued its journey.

   The state House today debated whether
to censure rather than impeach Treasurer A. James Manchin for his
handling of an investment fund that lost $279 million.
   Delegate James Pitrolo, Manchin's chief defender, asked for
censure, telling fellow lawmakers they were ``standing here today
on the threshold of history. You will decide how we will be judged
for the rest of our political lives.''
   The House Judiciary Committee, in a 17-7 vote Monday,
recommended 18 articles of impeachment against Manchin. If the
House impeaches Manchin and the Senate convicts him, he will lose
his job and possibly his pension, estimated at $2,128 a month.
   ``I have not harmed the people of this state in any way at all.
There has been no proof of malfeasance. I do know that justice will
prevail,'' the 61-year-old Manchin, a two-term Democrat, said
Tuesday.
   Before Pitrolo spoke, Democratic Delegate Ramona Cerra told the
House she received three threatening telephone calls Tuesday night.
She did not detail the nature of the threats or say from whom they
came.
   The House also was to consider a censure motion against Auditor
Glen Gainer, 60, a four-term Democrat. He and Manchin served on the
Board of Investments, which had general supervision of the fund.
   Some delegates predicted a wide margin in favor of impeachment,
which requires a simple majority, but Pitrolo said the vote would
be close.
   ``I'm giving them an option to look at the evidence and arrive
at a decision that while the evidence is not strong enough to
warrant impeachment, there was evidence that some sort of action
should be taken,'' Pitrolo said.
   Delegate Marc Harman, who is leading the impeachment effort,
called it ``a heart and mind issue, an emotional issue.''
   The impeachment resolution said Manchin failed to supervise the
state's consolidated investment fund, which was under the control
of his office. It accused him for delegating too much authority,
making improper investments, paying out interest that was not
earned and covering up the losses.
   Senate President Larry Tucker has notified the Senate to be
ready to hear the case in late May if the House votes to impeach.
   Twenty-three of the 34 senators would have to vote to convict.

<HEAD>Study Projects Little Change from Census Adjustments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study concludes that skewing the Census
Bureau's national headcount, as has been proposed in various forms
by lawmakers and special interest groups, would make little
difference in the allocation of House seats.
   Population shifts since 1980 are expected to result in the shift
of 18 or more seats, various experts agree.
   But even combining the various suggested adjustments would shift
a maximum of just four additional seats among California,
Pennsylvania, Kentucky and Minnesota, population analyst William P.
O'Hare reports.
   ``It appears that none of the adjustments to Census figures that
are being urged upon the bureau are likely to make a big difference
in the overall apportionment of Congress,'' O'Hare reported in the
latest issue of ``Population Today,'' the newsletter of the private
Population Reference Bureau.
   The census, taken every 10 years, is required by the
Constitution to redistribute the 435 House seats, keeping them
relatively even in population. Because the number of House members
is limited, whenever a state gains a seat, another state must lose
one.
   Last year the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census
Bureau, decreed that the 1990 results would not be adjusted.
Various interest groups, however, continue to push the idea.
Several lawsuits and congressional bills have been filed seeking to
force changes.
   The main dispute over adjusting the count centers on either
increasing the totals to add minorities presumed to have been
missed or reducing the total to subtract illegal aliens or people
who are ``imputed.''
   Imputed people are those counted despite the fact that Census
officials do not actually contact them. For example, when neighbors
say someone lives at a house even though the census taker
repeatedly cannot locate those people, that person is counted.
   The suit contending minorities are undercounted was filed in
U.S. District Court in Brooklyn by New York; Los Angeles; Chicago;
Dade County, Fla.; the NAACP and groups representing Hispanics and
the nation's mayors.
   A separate suit, seeking to remove the effect of illegal aliens,
was filed in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh by the Immigration
Reform Law Institute on behalf of 42 members of Congress,
Pennsylvania, Kansas, Alabama and the Federation for American
Immigration Reform.
   An analysis of the 1980 census concluded that more than 5
percent of blacks and Hispanics were missed, considerably more than
the number of whites who were said to have been uncounted. Thus,
interest groups have urged increasing the minority count in each
state by a predetermined percentage.
   Such a move would be expected to benefit states with large
minority populations, but O'Hare's calculations said that would not
be the case.
   ``Interestingly,'' concluded O'Hare, ``minority undercount
adjustment, the modification of the census figures which has
received the most attention, would not result in the movement of
any seats between states.''
   On the other hand, he calculated that eliminating illegal aliens
from the count would result in the transfer of one House seat from
California to Pennsylvania.
   ``This is not surprising when you realize that the 1980 census
figures for California included an estimated 1 million illegal
aliens,'' O'Hare commented. Taking them out of the California
population would cost that state a House seat; Pennsylvania would
be next in line for that seat.
   Some states are more difficult to count and thus have more
imputed people than others, O'Hare found. He estimated that
subtracting imputed people from the count would cost Kentucky a
seat. Once again, the gainer would be Pennsylvania.
   O'Hare also calculated the results of various combinations of
these adjustments:
   _Adding in allegedly uncounted minorities and subtracting
estimated illegal aliens would move one seat from Minnesota to
Pennsylvania.
   _Adding in minorities and subtracting the imputed people would
transfer seats from Kentucky and Minnesota to Pennsylvania and
California.
   _Subtracting both illegal aliens and imputed people would move
one House seat from California to Pennsylvania.
   _Making all three adjustments would move one seat from
California to Pennsylvania.
   The various changes calculated by O'Hare would be in addition to
reallocartions of House seats caused by discernable shifts in
population since 1980.
   While the exact shifts won't be known until after the census,
the Population Reference Bureau and the private Election Data
Service have projected changes based on recent Census Bureau
population estimates.
   Both groups anticipate the shift of 18 seats from northern
states to the South and West, mirroring the flow of population.
   Gainers are expected to be: California, 5; Texas, 4; Florida, 3;
Arizona, 2; Georgia, 2; North Carolina, 1 and Virginia, 1.
   Expected to lose seats are: New York, 3; Pennsylvania, 3;
Illinois, 2; Michigan, 2; Ohio, 2; Iowa, 1; Kansas, 1;
Massachusetts, 1; Montana, 1; West Virginia, 1, and Wisconsin, 1.

   Watergate won't be erased from the
archives of the Richard M. Nixon Library, the library's executive
director promises.
   ``It won't be a museum on Watergate, but we're not going to shy
away from it, either. It's part of what interests people about
Nixon,'' Hugh Hewitt said Tuesday.
   Hewitt, a former Nixon assistant and official in the Reagan
administration, is trying to raise $25 million for the presidential
library, the first built entirely with private donations.
   It is expected to open in the spring or summer of 1990 in this
community 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   ``My most difficult role will be persuading those who don't want
to understand the Nixon legacy,'' he said. ``He started the
Environmental Protection Agency, he launched the war on cancer,
concluded the Vietnam War, opened China and strengthened NATO. He
was the central historical figure of the post-World War II era.''

   A pilot for a Japanese airline committed suicide
Wednesday, four days after he was involved in a minor landing
accident with his plane, police said.
   Itsuji Shimohira of Japan Air System, a domestic airline, hanged
himself as a way of taking responsibility for the accident, said a
police official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Shimohira's Japanese-made YS-11 plane scraped its tail on the

   Although six U.S. presidents have called him
Santa Claus, the courts say a jolly, bearded man's neighbors are
not obliged to tolerate his plastic reindeer and Christmas
paraphernalia all year long.
   Robert George can still invite terminally ill children to visit
``Santa's Dreamworld'' in his garage, but the thousands of lights
and decorations on the lawn have to go _ except for the month
before Christmas.
   ``To me it's a big victory,'' said George, 64.
   George has been battling Glendale over complaints from neighbors
irritated by the huge number of visitors, as many as 15,000 each
year, to his three-bedroom house 15 miles north of Los Angeles.
   The American Civil Liberties Union intervened on George's behalf
after a ruling in November 1987 restricting activities at his house.
   Lawyer Carol Sobel said a ruling by the 2nd Appellate District
Court on Monday defended George's constitutional rights.
   The court upheld limits on the number of decorations at George's
house and the months they could be illuminated, but said he could
be Santa Claus 12 months of the year.
   The retired Nebraska barber has been recognized as the
presidential Santa Claus since 1956, when Dwight D. Eisenhower
invited him to the White House. He made his last White House
appearance during Jimmy Carter's presidency.

   The Benevolent and Loyal Order Of
Pessimists has decided to nix its plans for an annual convention.
   It wouldn't have been any fun, and besides, ``Traditions require
too much optimism,'' says President Jack Duvall.
   The group has been meeting each year since 1975 on a weekend
closest to April 15, income tax day and also the anniversary of the
sinking of the Titanic, which Duvall calls ``a monument to
optimism.''
   ``We just don't think you should get unrealistic hopes up,''
Duvall said. ``You'll only make yourself unhappy.''
   Duvall, which is not his real name, said he didn't want to
divulge his identity or have his picture taken because he was
worried about losing his job.
   The club, which he says has a worldwide membership in the
``mid-three digits,'' formed by happenstance.
   A group of about a dozen friends met 14 years ago in a small
restaurant in Tiffin, Iowa to celebrate a friend's 30th birthday,
Duvall said. Also meeting at the restaurant was a group of
optimists.
   ``After a few drinks some words were exchanged and we decided
the world really needed a pessimists group to counteract the
influence of these bizarre optimists and their strange rituals.''
   At the annual conference, winners of the ``Pessimist of the
Year'' award get ``a nice trophy in the shape of the rear end of a
horse,'' Duvall said.

   An edible Eiffel Tower is the piece de
resistance of a French exhibition that features the cookie as art.
   The exhibition, which opens April 5 at the French Institute,
shows paintings, photographs and cartoons commissioned since 1983
by the BSN Group, a French food company.
   The collection was built around Firmin Bouisset's original 1897
painting of ``The Little Schoolboy.'' It ranges from a Marc Riboud
photo series of a cookie-clasping Marcel Marceau to Italian artist
Lanfranco Antonello's intricate collage, made of dried leaves,
depicting a pastry shop.
   The 7-foot-tall wooden tower, studded with cookies stuck to
colorful frosting, was done by Dorthee Selz of Paris, a creator of
edible art.
   ``It's like architecture for me,'' said Selz. She confided, ``I
don't eat cookies too much.''
   Bowls of cookies will be strategically placed around the exhibit
until April 29, when art-lovers will be allowed to devour the
tower. Until then, if any wayward nibbling occurs, ``I don't want
to know about it,'' said Selz.

   Two Czechoslovak teen-agers shot
their way onto a jetliner Wednesday in Prague and ordered it to the
United States, but the crew convinced them it couldn't fly that far
and they gave up in Frankfurt.
   They surrendered when American military would not let them enter
the U.S. Air Force base adjacent to Frankfurt's commercial airport.
   Police said no one was hurt and the incident ended peacefully
less than three hours after its violent start in the Czechoslovak
capital, where nearly all passengers were freed.
   Witnesses at Ruzyne Airport in Prague said the teen-agers took a
woman hostage, crashed through a glass wall of the VIP lounge,
fired several shots and threatened a stewardess.
   About 100 people were reported to be on Tupolev-154 of the
Hungarian airline Malev whevening newscast, the ZDF television network
mentioned
``unconfirmed reports'' that they wanted to stay in West Germany.
   Neitzel said the passengers still aboard the plane when it
landed in Frankfurt were three Hungarians, four Czechoslovaks, a
Dutch citizen, two Canadians and a Romanian, as well as the crew of
four.
   Hungary's news agency and CTK, the official Czechoslovak agency,
said the flight crew convinced the young hijackers the plane could
not cross the ocean and they then demanded to be taken to
Barcelona, Spain.
   After entering West German airspace, however, the youths told
the pilot to land at Frankfurt because they wanted to deal with the
Americans at nearby military facilities, said Hans-Ulrich Ohl, head
of the federal flight safety office in Frankfurt.
   U.S. military authorities refused to allow the Hungarian jet
onto Rhein-Main Air Base. Roland Desch, a police investigator, said
a military truck was driven onto the taxiway to prevent the from
entering the base.
   Karl-Heinz Wagner, another police spokesman, said the teen-agers
carried a sawed-off shotgun, a rifle and a fake hand grenade.
   Airport spokesman Wolfgang Schwalm said they ``wanted to go to
the American side of the airport. The Americans declined to accept
them, and at that point the hijackers gave up.''
   An air traffic official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the hijackers ``wanted to deliver a letter'' to American
authorities, but ``the Americans didn't want to have anything to do
with them.''
   Eberhard Bock, a U.S. Air Force spokesman, said: ``Two men got
off the plane and they were held by U.S. military security police
until the German police arrived and took over. It never was in our
hands because the plane stopped short of the military section of
the airport.''
   Asked whether U.S. military authorities had refused to become
involved in the hijacking incident, as Frankfurt police had said,
he replied: ``That is true. Acting base commander (Col. Joseph)
Petrazio decided that the plane would not be allowed to taxi onto
the military section.''

   The death toll from clashes between
police and ethnic Albanians in a southern province climbed to 23 on
Wednesday when two wounded demonstrators died, the state news
agency said.
   There were reports of attempted strikes and scattered street
protests, but the region was relatively calm for the first day in
about a week. A dusk-to-dawn curfew remained in force, and state TV
showed army tanks and jets on maneuver in Kosovo province.
   Police sources and witnesses, meanwhile, said the ferocity of
the clashes in the province on Monday and Tuesday caught security
forces off guard.
   Radmilo Bogdanovic, Serbia's interior minister, told officials
in Belgrade on Wednesday that only 2,400 police were deployed
Monday against an estimated 14,000 ethnic Albanian demonstrators in
Kosovo.
   Although ethnic tension between Serbs and Albanians had been
simmering for some time, few expected the protesters and police to
open fire on each other with handguns and automatic weapons as they
did in cities, towns and villages.
   One police officer said in an interview Wednesday that he was so
frightened by the violence he stole a license plate from a wrecked
civilian vehicle and put it on his police car so he could escape
the fighting.
   Other officers, who also demanded anonymity, said demonstrators
commandeered a bulldozer to attack security forces.
   Near Pristina, ethnic Albanians strafed a police helicopter from
a minaret during the fighting Monday and Tuesday, police and
witnesses said.
   In the town of Decani, where about 1,000 people battled police
for two hours Tuesday, demonstrators injured 14 policemen by
shooting from rooftops and the windows of buildings, the state news
agency Tanjug said Wednesday.
   In all, 23 people were killed and 74 injured. That official
death toll is the highest reported from ethnic unrest in Kosovo
since the end of World War II. In 1981, at least nine people died
in ethnic riots whose anniversary will be celebrated on Saturday.
   The latest protests in Kosovo, which is part of the republic of
Serbia, began last week after Kosovo's Parliament approved
constitutional changes giving Serbia control of the provincial
police, courts and civil defense.
   Serbia said the changes are needed to protect the province's
Slav minority from persecution at the hands of ethnic Albanians.
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up 85 percent of Kosovo's 1.9 million
citizens, say the changes threaten autonomy they won under the 1974
constitution.
   Tanjug reported scattered attempts at strikes and street
protests Wednesday, the first day of relative calm in the province
since Kosovo's Parliament passed the disputed constitutional
changes Thursday.
   Tanjug said police dispersed about 150 youths and detained 18
who tried to march to the center of the west Kosovo town of Pec. No
injuries were reported.
   Police patrols thinned slightly in Pristina by late Wednesday.
   Two policemen _ a Serb and an ethnic Albanian _ were buried in
two Kosovo villages while police kept guard with Soviet-made T-55
tanks.
   Alia Shexholija, the Communist Party chief in the Kosovo town of
Podujevo, was quoted in the Belgrade daily Politika Ekspres as
saying the security forces reacted ``too mildly'' at the start of
Monday's clashes.
   Police were not equipped to face such aggression and didn't even
have bullet-proof vests, he said. Other papers reported that one
injured officer died because his colleagues were unable to evacuate
him quickly.

   President Bush on Wednesday embraced a private
commission's report calling for federal pay increases as ``very
timely'' and said he will promptly ask Congress to raise the pay of
top executive branch officials, senators, representatives and
judges.
   Bush spoke after receiving the recommendations of the National
Commission on Public Service, a 36-member panel headed by former
Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. The group called for steps
to make government jobs more attractive, including a pay raise
nearly as large as the one Congress killed last month after public
outcries over its magnitude.
   Neither Bush nor White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
indicated what Bush's recommendation would be. It would have to be
enacted by Congress.
   ``This is very timely,'' the president told members of the
commission. ``In the next few days, I`ll be making some very
specific proposals.''
   Volcker would not speculate on whether he believed Congress
would endorse an increase, but said that based on talks with
lawmakers, ``I do find some renewal of interest in the subject.''
   House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., was more pessimistic,
saying, ``Will something get done this year? I doubt it. Something
needs to be done but I'm not at all optimistic.''
   The commission's pay proposal is similar to one made in the
final weeks of the Reagan administration by a congressionally
created commission that assesses federal pay every four years. Both
then-President Reagan and Bush endorsed that proposed 51 percent
increase, but it foundered on public opposition to a congressional
pay raise.
   The Volcker Commission plan proposes some new wrinkles.
   For one thing, only 25 per cent of the increase would be
effective immediately. The rest would wait until a new Congress
convenes in 1991.
   For another, members of Congress would have to give up the
speaking fees, or honoraria, with which many supplement their
incomes.
   ``Not only does such income create lingering doubts about the
need for an across-the-board increase, but it also undermines
public trust in national institutions,'' the panel said.
   The commission also recommended pay increases for rank-and-file
federal employees, but suggested they be absorbed into existing
budgets by reductions in force and elimination of programs. It also
suggested that the pay rates vary from locality to locality, based
on the cost of living.
   Spokesmen for organized labor reacted coolly to this proposal.
   John N. Sturdivant, national president of the American
Federation of Government Employees, endorsed the report ``as far as
it goes,'' adding, ``Unfortunately, it is a jigsaw puzzle with some
of the most important pieces missing.''
   He said that besides giving raises to executives, non-management
federal workers must also have their salaries raised to the level
of their private sector counterparts
   ``Only after such action is taken can locality pay play a
realistic role in bringing equity to federal workers,'' Sturdivant
said.
   Douglas Fraser, former president of the United Automobile
Workers and a member of the commission, said that organized labor
generally supports the commission's report, but disagrees with the
proposal that pay vary from locality to locality. ``It creates in
many cases gross inequalities,'' Fraser said.
   Among other recommendations:
   _The president should ``set the highest standards of ethical
conduct for those who hold the public trust, and act quickly and
firmly to remove those who violate that trust.''
   _ The financial disclosure process, ``while a key protection
against conflicts of interest, should be streamlined to ease the
burdens on potential appointees.''
   _The number of presidential political appointees should be
reduced from the current level of about 3,000 to about 2,000 and
career officials should more frequently be considered for
sub-cabinet appointments.
   _The president and Congress should establish a public service
scholarship program open to 1,000 students who would receive
tuition and costs in return for a commitment to a specified term of
government service.

   The Imam of the Brussels Mosque and his
aide were shot and killed today, police said. The attack followed
threats on the Moslem leader prompted by his comments about Salman
Rushdie and his book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Killed were Imam Abdullah Ahdal, a 36-year-old Saudi, and his
aide, Salem Behir, 40, of Tunisia. Behir oversees the mosque's
social service and library.
   No arrests were made, and there was no claim of responsiblity
for the killings.
   A police spokesman said both men were shot in the head at about
6:30 p.m. in Ahdal's office inside the mosque, which is in a park
near the European Community's headquarters.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the imam
received threats after he made a statement on Belgian television
about Rushdie, whose novel is considered blasphemous by many
Moslems.
   A television reporter said the station received angry telephone
calls after Ahdal's Feb. 20 appearance. Callers said his remarks
had been improperly translated from Arabic.
   Although Ahdal's remarks were considered moderate, the reporter
said he had condemned the British author's book.
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini order Moslems to seek
out Rushdie and kill him because of his novel. The author has been
in hiding since Khomeini issued the death decree Feb. 14.

   The Bush administration is leaning against a

White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday.
   Although no final decision has yet been made on additional steps

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, part of a high-level

grounded tanker Exxon Valdez, gave a preliminary report to
President Bush by phone, Fitzwater said.
   ``It was a brief conversation, but Secretary Skinner reported
good cooperation between the various authorities involved,''
Fitzwater said.
   He said Skinner reported ``things were more positive than they
might have believed.''
   Skinner is at the site with Coast Guard Adm. Paul Yost and
William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency. They are due back on Thursday and will give a report to the
president, Fitzwater said.
   Exxon, which is charged by law with the cleanup operation, was
being assisted by the state, the Coast Guard and local fishermen in
trying to contain the growing 100-square-mile slick and protect
hundreds of pristine islands in its path.
   Bush on Tuesday had said there were ``conflicting reports'' on
whether Exxon was doing enough to try to contain damage from the
oil spill, and said that a federal takeover of the cleanup was one
option.
   However, Fitzwater told reporters on Wednesday that ``I would
guide you a little bit away from that. The preliminary feeling is
that the resources are there, on the job,'' and that the cleanup is
probably as effective is it would be under federal supervision.
   However, he said ``there have been conflicting reports'' on
Exxon's role. ``That's why they're up there,'' he said, referring
to the federal officials.
   The spill was caused after the oil tanker ran aground on Friday,
spilling more than 10 million gallons of oil.
   ``The various parties there are working together, the governor's
office, Exxon and local fishermen are making a lot of efforts to
bring in local citizens to help with the cleanup effort,'' the
White House spokesman said.
   The three officials flew over the spill on Tuesday after their
arrival, then met with Exxon officials and with Alaska Gov. Steve
Cowper, a Democrat, who had criticized Exxon's response as slow and
inadequate.
   The U.S. team, Fitzwater said, ``didn't have any conclusions to
report at this point other than to say there was good cooperation
among the cleanup parties involved there, that everyone appeared to
be dedicated and working as hard as possible.''
   Bush has said that the oil spill would not diminish his support
for a plan open a pristine arctic wildlife refuge to oil drilling.
   Fitzwater on Wednesday reiterated the administration's support
for oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, on
Alaska's northern reaches.
   ``He's saying his general policy hasn't changed. He doesn't want
to signal any kind of other peripheral changes at this point until
we know what we've learned from the oil spill,'' Fitzwater said.
``It may well be we could learn things that would be applicable.''

   Local politics overwhelmed even heavy
White House campaigning in a special congressional election in
which Democrats wrested away the seat once held by Vice President
Dan Quayle.
   Jill Long, a business professor, used two county tax issues in
her successful race against GOP opponent Dan Heath, a former city
official.
   Long's 1,700-vote margin Tuesday reversed her fortunes from last
fall, when she lost the district race by 50,000 votes.
   ``(Heath) wanted to take the George Bush tax pledge, but he had
been in an administration involved in a tax raise,'' said Brad
Senden, a consultant to Long's campaign. ``So he was immediately
involved in a contradiction.''
   Heath was safety director under Fort Wayne Mayor Paul Helmke,
who recently engineered the passage of a 0.2 percent city income
tax and sought annexation of a Republican-dominated county
township, a move that would mean higher property tax rates.
   Long used both issues in her advertising, claiming the
administration's tactics belied Heath's campaign promise not to
support tax increases.
   In his concession speech, Heath conceded the attacks hurt his
candidacy. ``There are times when one must be sacrificed on the
altar of good government, whether it be (tax) or annexation,'' he
said.
   Long said her victory was not a rebuff for the White House or
Quayle, who campaigned for Heath. ``This was just a race between
two individuals in northeast Indiana,'' she said.
   Quayle called Long with congratulations, and ``offered to assist
in any way because he's committed to the Fourth District,'' she
said.
   Later, Long seemed to back away even from her campaign's tax
issue attacks, saying the city administration's chief failure was
not seeking broader resident involvement in the decision. ``It's a
style of management rather than the issue itself,'' she said.
   Long had lost by landslide margins in 1986 and in her 1988
effort to oust GOP incumbent Dan Coats. Some Democrats wrote off
her political career after the second loss, but Long said she
realized Coats, a former House aide to Quayle, might be appointed
to fill his Senate seat. ``We kept our campaign headquarters open
and assembled a team of private advisers,'' she said.
   Long had no opponents in the party nominating caucus, while
Heath, then relatively unknown even in the city, was running in a
field of nine candidates.
   Long becomes the first Democrat to hold the northeastern Indiana
seat since J. Edward Roush lost to Quayle in a 1976 re-election
campaign. Long said her thoughts had not turned to the re-election
effort that begins soon in a shortened 19-month term.

<TEXT>
   With songs, bells and balloons, Oklahoma is
celebrating the 100th anniversary of the biggest land run in
history.
   The big blow-out will come April 22 and mark the actual
anniversary of the scramble by an estimated 40,000 people for 2
million acres of Indian Territory opened to white settlement.
   On Tuesday, school children and others in more than a half-dozen
cities and towns watched a horseback rider re-enact the dispatching
of President Benjamin Harrison's March 23, 1889, proclamation
offering the free land.
   Planners figured that a century ago it probably took until March
28 for the news to travel to Oklahoma from Washington, D.C.
   The observance should help people understand that Oklahoma
history did not begin with the land run of 1889 and that Indians
settled the area first and made it hospitable, Cherokee Chief Wilma
Mankiller said.
   The celebration ``was pretty dad-gummed nice,'' Charles Owens,
chairman of the Crescent Centennial Commission.
   ``We had over 100 direct descendants of '89ers, those who had
made the run,'' Owens said. ``They registered with their name and
the name of the ancestor who made the run.''
   Then, each of those decendants ``took one stroke'' on the
centennial bell that stands outside Centennial Headquarters in
Crescent, a town of 1,700, he said.
   From there, the proclamation was carried by horseback to
Guthrie, Stillwater, Norman, Kingfisher, El Reno and Oklahoma City.
In Guthrie, the original state capital, the Langston University
choir and band offered patriotic music on the steps of the Scottish
Rite Temple.
   Camp Fire boys and girls released hundreds of balloons carrying
messages announcing the opening of the Unassigned Lands.
   In El Reno, on the other side of that once-forbidden zone, the
centennial rider was intercepted by ``the cavalry'' and accused of
being a Sooner _ one of those who didn't wait for the official
opening. U.S. marshals threw the rider in jail as part of the
spectacle.
   More balloons were released at Norman, and at Kingfisher, a
girl's choir in period dress sang original songs and the American
Legion fired a 21-gun salute.
   Coincidentally, the nation's second-largest Indian tribe, the
Cherokees, are planning a more somber observance this weekend of
the 150th anniversary of a forced march to Oklahoma from their
homes in the Southeast. The march along a path known as the Trail
of Tears ended in March 1839.

   Sales of new, single-family homes slumped in
February to the lowest level in more than a year, the government
said Wednesday, and analysts expect further declines as rising
mortgage rates push more people out of the market.
   Sales dropped 9.4 percent in February to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 626,000 after advancing 2.5 percent in January, when
unusually mild weather brought out more buyers.
   The drop in sales was accompanied by an 8.9 percent increase in
the median price of the homes sold, which analysts said showed that
lower-income purchasers were the ones who left the market.
   ``The first people forced out of the market in times of rising
rates are first-time buyers who barely qualify to buy a home,''
said John Tuccillo, chief economist of the National Association of
Realtors.
   Last month's median price for a new home was $123,100, meaning
half the homes sold for more and half for less. The average price,
which is pulled up by sales of very expensive homes, was up 9.2
percent to $150,200.
   Analysts said that because the housing market is particularly
sensitive to interest rates, it is among the sectors of the economy
most directly affected as the Federal Reserve Board tries to
restrain growth and dampen inflationary pressures by driving rates
upward.
   Housing construction and sales of existing homes also were down
sharply during February, according to earlier reports from the
Commerce Department.
   ``The housing sector is stumbling,'' said economist Bruce
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York. ``It's an indication
that higher mortgage rates are taking a toll on the housing sector,
one which is likely to intensify over the next couple of months.''
   Fixed-rate home mortgages last week were averaging 11.22
percent, up from 9.99 percent a year earlier, according to a
national survey by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   One-year adjustable rate mortgages also were up sharply, with
lenders asking an average initial rate of 9.3 percent last week, up
from 7.52 percent a year earlier, Freddie Mac said.
   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said the decline in home sales reflected the higher
interest rates and ``probably some slowing in the economy.''
   It was the biggest decline since a 9.5 percent drop last
November and left sales at the lowest rate since the 576,000 level
of January 1988.
   Tuccillo said that with mortgage rates expected to continue
rising through the spring, new home sales likely will decline
further over the next few months and then start to pick up.
   Dave Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, said sales for all of 1989 are expected to be down 6
percent from last year, but the situation could be worse if the Fed
tightens credit too severely.
   ``Our association is very uptight about what the Fed has been
doing,'' Seiders said. ``When the Fed moves to slow down an economy
like this, they almost always overshoot.''
   The biggest drop in new home sales last month was recorded in
the Northeast, where sales dropped 19.9 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 101,000. The Northeast market has weakened
after several years in which strong sales resulted in overbuilding
and inflated prices.
   Sales last month were off 14.4 percent in the South to an annual
rate of 214,000, down 1.4 percent in the West to 210,000, and down
1 percent in the Midwest to 101,000.

   An effort by the Army and the Italian gunmaker
Beretta to correct a fault in the military's new 9mm pistol has
taken twice as long as expected and deliveries of the handgun won't
resume until May, service officials say.
   ``We have a design approved, but the production didn't get up
and running as quickly as we had hoped,'' says Lt. Col. John Reitz,
an Army spokesman at the Pentagon.
   ``We don't expect deliveries with the new design to begin until
May,'' Reitz said in a recent interview.
   In the meantime, the Army has decided to reduce by two-thirds
the number of times gun already in use may be fired before
replacing the chamber slide mechanism, the defective part.
   Noting an accident earlier this year in which a chamber slide
shattered, the Army reduced from 3,000 to 1,000 the number of
firings allowed before the slide was replaced.
   The change is expected to have little effect for the time being
``because most personnel fire the pistol fewer than 100 times per
year,'' the spokesman said.
   Beretta USA, which operates a manufacturing plant in Accokeek,
Md., beat out seven competitors in 1985 for the right to provide
9mm guns to replace the military's venerable Colt .45. The Army,
which has designated the 9mm pistol the M-9, is serving as the
executive buying agent for all the services and awarded Beretta an
initial contract worth $75 million for 315,000 pistols.
   Beretta USA is a subsidiary of the Italian arms maker Armi
Beretta SpA and has so far delivered more than 140,000 pistols. It
agreed last August to suspend deliveries, starting in September,
until it corrected the problem of cracking slides.
   At the time, company and Army officials announced that the
gunmaker had agreed to change the way it made the metal slides by
forging them with an improved heat process to ensure their
strength. The company also agreed to fit each gun, including those
already produced, with a pin device to capture any slide that did
crack.
   The pin device would keep the slide or fragments from being
thrown back into the shooter's chest or face in the event of a
failure.
   When that agreement was hammered out last summer, Beretta and
Army officials said deliveries of the improved gun would begin in
January.
   ``It's just taken longer than we thought,'' Reitz said.
   Reitz said the production delay was not having much of an impact
on the services because ``the troops still have their older
weapons; there's no shortage.''
   Ralph Cole, a spokesman for Beretta USA, said Wednesday the
company planned to begin delivering in April new slides and safety
pin devices for guns already in use. He agreed with Reitz that
deliveries of complete pistols would not resume until May, but
declined to detail the reasons for the additional delay.
   The January accident was the fifth in which a chamber slide on a
Beretta cracked, sending fragments toward the shooter. In this
case, Reitz said the incident left a Marine only slightly injured
but prompted the Army to establish the new safety standard for gun
useage.
   The slide bolt on the Beretta is thrown backward after a shot is
fired as part of the process of loading a new round into the gun's
chamber.
   In a related development, the Army spokesman said the Navy's
SEAL commando forces had ``backtracked'' and decided not to switch
to the Beretta 9mm, in part because of concern over the slide
failures.
   ``The Army agreed with that decision because of the special
circumstances that apply,'' Reitz said.
   ``First of all, their level of usage is just incredible, as much
as 30,000 rounds a year. And they're dragging the guns in and out
of the water. So the Navy decided to look at other pistols and the
Army is going to do the same when it comes to our Special
Operations Forces.''

<HEAD>U.S. Agrees To Compromise On European Demands For Farm Subsidies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, threatened with the
collapse of international trade talks, has accepted a compromise on
its controversial proposal to eliminate farm subsidies, agriculture
officials said Wednesday.
   The U.S. compromise may help break a stalemate with the European
Economic Community that has derailed talks among 100 nations on
liberalizing trade in everything from corn to computer chips.
   The controversy centers around the 12-nation EEC's rejection of
a U.S. demand for elimination of farm supports, which the United
States contends distort international trade. The sides were unable
to reach a compromise at a meeting of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade in Montreal last December and postponed further
negotiations until April 5 in Geneva.
   Other members of GATT, which regulates international commerce,
have refused to take any action on other pressing trade problems
until the two economic giants settle their agriculture clash.
   The United States has agreed to European language that would
call for a ``progressive substantial reduction'' of support for
farmers, but not total elimination, said Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter.
   Another Agriculture Department official, speaking on condition
he not be identified, said the EEC had indicated to U.S.
negotiators that it would accept the compromise language proposed
by the Swiss chairman of the GATT, Arthur Dunkel.
   ``What we have tried to do is state it in a manner that might be
a little more palatable politically to our European counterparts,''
Yeutter said in an interview on National Public Radio.
   Yeutter, who represented the United States at the Montreal talks
in his previous capacity as trade representative, denied the new
formulation constituted a compromise for the United States.
   ``As I indicated, it may be slightly more palatable in Western
Europe, and if so we're glad to have it be accepted on that
basis,'' Yeutter said. But that formulation ``will get us to the
ultimate objective of getting rid of the trade-distorting kind of
practices in agriculture around the world,'' he said.
   The EEC, facing concerted pressure from a larger and more
powerful farm lobby than the United States has, contends it too
would like to reduce agricultural subsidies but it cannot accept a
U.S. demand for their total elimination.
   The United States says that as long as the Europeans support
their farmers, it too must prop up American farmers so they can
compete on world markets. U.S. supports, which go mostly for
production, reached about $26 million in 1987 and dropped slightly
last year because of the drought.
   The U.S. position on farm supports has been gradually eroding
since last year, when former President Reagan dropped his original
goal for the worldwide elimination of farm subsidies by the year
2000.
   The United States then took the position that it was not setting
any date for elimination of the supports but was seeking instead a
commitment from all GATT members for eventual elimination.
   In the absence of such a commitment, the United States intends
to press the EEC at the Geneva meeting to reduce its export subsidy
for farmers. Yeutter said the United States has had to keep up with
the Europeans by increasing export supports for farmers and ``it's
really sheer economic madness.''
   Another potential sticking point in Geneva is a new EEC demand
that the United States freeze current limitations on the size of
farm lands used for production. The United States asked farmers to
idle some lands last year because of the drought.
   Yeutter said he would reject the EEC demand.
   ``The European community is trying to lock us into that position
forever and we just can't afford to have that take place,'' he said.
   Agriculture Department officials say they will decide by June 1
whether to maintain the existing limitations on farm production,
depending on their determination of the past winter's drought
damage.

<HEAD>Detainee Takes Refuge at U.S. Consulate after Escape from Hospital</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black detainee on a hunger
strike escaped in his pajamas from a hospital Wednesday and took
refuge at the U.S. Consulate 360 miles away.
   Six other black activists were encamped at the British Embassy
in Pretoria, demanding that police lift restrictions imposed on
them after their release from detention. The embassy said it hoped
the six would leave, but they were given blankets to spend the
night.
   Simon Ntombela, a teacher and anti-apartheid organizer, escaped
at daybreak from Shifa Hospital in the port city of Durban, police
said. Late in the afternoon, U.S. diplomats said Ntombela had
reached the consulate on the 11th floor of a Johannesburg office
building, apparently after taking a commercial flight from Durban.
   ``We have been in touch with the South African government with a
view toward resolving this case as expeditiously as possible,''
said Gene Friedman, a U.S. Embassy spokesman.
   Ntombela, 27, was the eighth detainee to escape from a hospital
since September. He fled as the government announced plans to
prevent future breakouts by moving hunger strikers to Bloemfontein,
a relatively remote provincial capital.
   Three detainees who escaped in September holed up in the U.S.
Consulate in Johannesburg for five weeks, and four detainees
escaped to the West German Embassy in Pretoria this month. All
seven were allowed to go free.
   Ntombela, detained since September, was hospitalized in early
March for treatment of depression and began a hunger strike March
13, his lawyers said.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha said police were studying Ntombela's
case and a decision would be made later as to whether he could go
free.
   Botha said the five men and one woman who entered the British
Embassy at midday Wednesday would not be arrested if they left,
even though some had violated their restrictions.
   The British Embassy said the group ``cannot stay indefinitely on
British government premises and should leave.''
   One of the six was Donsie Khumalo, an official of the Congress
of South African Trade Unions, the main black labor federation. He
was released last week after staging a hunger strike to protest
being held without charge.
   The detainees are held under a state of emergency declared in
June 1986 to quell anti-apartheid unrest in black townships.
   Like many other freed activists, Khumalo, 39, is barred from
various political activities, required to report to a police
station twice daily, and confined to his house at night.
   Colleagues of the six said they sought to encourage Britain to
pressure South African authorities to lift restrictions on all
former detainees.
   Their move coincided with a visit to neighboring Zimbabwe by
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has been urging
negotiations to resolve South Africa's racial conflict.
   Brig. Leon Mellet, a spokesman for Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok, said detainees who stage hunger strikes in the future
will be placed in Grootvlei Prison in Bloemfontein and, if they
require hospitalization, will be sent to a nearby hospital.
   Bloemfontein, in central South Africa, is far from other cities.
Detainees held there would have more difficulty escaping and
publicity about the hunger strike campaign might be reduced.

<TEXT>
   President Najib asked the United
Nations on Wednesday to establish checkpoints along the
Afghan-Pakistani border to prevent arms and troops from reaching
Moslem guerrillas, a spokesman said.
   Najib made the request in a letter sent to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani.
   Amani also said guerrillas aided by Pakistani troops continued
rocket and artillery fire in and around the city of Jalalabad,
where guerrillas have surrounded government forces since March 6.
   Amani said the 11th and 18th divisions of Pakistan's army were
inside Afghanistan. In the last 24 hours, they had fired long-range
weapons at Afghan government forces.
   Kabul says the Pakistanis are sending a steady stream of troops
and weapons to help the guerrillas, who have been fighting the
Soviet-backed government for nine years.
   Pakistan, like the United States, supports the guerrillas but
denies having troops in Afghanistan.
   Neither the border post proposal nor the accusation against
Pakistan is new, but the allegations have increased in vehemence
and frequency since Feb. 15, when the last Soviet soldiers who had
been backing Najib's troops left the country.
   Amani said there was no doubt the government was ``dominant'' in
the fight for Jalalabad, 75 miles east of Kabul. He claimed that in
the 24-hour period ending Wednesday evening, government forces
killed 137 opposition fighters and injured 56. Afghan army troops
suffered no casualties, he said.
   Amani said five civilians were killed and 11 were wounded in
Jalalabad.
   The Soviet Union's official Tass news agency said in a dispatch
from Kabul that the cities of Herat, Ghazni, and Khost also came
under heavy artillery fire from opposition forces and that four
children in tose cities were killed.
   The figures could not be verified.
   Jalalabad is the guerrillas' first offensive since the Soviet
pullout and would be the biggest city they have captured. If it
falls, it would be a major blow to the morale of the government and
a big boost to the rebels.
   The government has not provided a death toll from the Jalalabad
fighting, but reports issued since it began add up to more than
2,600, with about 90 percent said to be guerrillas. The guerrillas
give far lower numbers.
   In the letter to Perez de Cuellar, Najib said the U.N. Good
Offices Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan, established to monitor
the departure of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, should take up
duty on the border.
   Amani said the proposal was urgent because the mission's mandate
expires Nov. 15.
   The force of 40 unarmed men from 10 nations does not have a
mandate as a peacekeeping force. Its job since the Soviet pullout
has been to take complaints from Kabul and Islamabad about alleged
violations by the other side.
   The Soviet withdrawal was brought about by a U.N.-sponsored
agreement signed in Geneva in April. As part of the accord,
Afghanistan and Pakistan agreed not to interfere in each other's
internal affairs.

   Gata Kamsky, the 14-year-old Soviet chess
prodigy viewed as a possible future world champion, defected from
his native land for the freedom to make choices about his chess
career and his future, another Soviet defector said Wednesday.
   Kamsky and his father, Rustam Kamsky, were at federal
immigration service offices in Manhattan, going through the
paperwork to gain asylum, said Lev Alburt, a chess grandmaster who
defected from the Soviet Union 10 years ago and since has won the
U.S. championship.
   Alburt disclosed Tuesday that Kamsky and his father asked for
asylum at the end of play Tuesday in the New York Open chess
tournament at the Penta Hotel.
   He said the Kamskys were taken in tow by Allen Kaufman,
executive director of the American Chess Foundation, and two FBI
agents, one of whom was fluent in Russian. Neither of the Kamskys
speaks English.
   Spokesmen for the FBI and the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service have not confirmed the defection, citing a
policy of saying nothing about asylum cases for the protection of
the defectors.
   The Soviet U.N. ambassador, Alexander M. Belonogov, had no
comment.
   Alburt, 43, said he had spoken to the Kamskys before they asked
for asylum.
   ``The bottom line for virtually all defection is the people
don't want to stay in the huge prison that any Communist country
is,'' he said. ``They want to be free, but in each case it may be a
different kind of freedom.
   ``In their case, it was freedom to travel to chess tournaments,
freedom to choose college, and so on.''
   Young Kamsky, a two-time Soviet national junior champion, was
heralded as a whiz kid last summer in a dispatch by Tass, the
official Soviet news agency.
   It described him as reading and writing at age 2 and being
placed in the fourth grade when he started school. It said the
father is a photographer and also coaches his son.

<HEAD>Pravda Says Voters Struck a Blow For Gorbachev's Reforms</HEAD>

   The Communist Party newspaper Pravda said
Wednesday that Soviet voters struck a blow for reform in
legislative elections, which many official candidates lost, and
three dates were announced for runoff contests.
   The newspaper said Sunday's election, the first in 70 years to
give voters a choice, was a vote for the new policies of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``Voters did not simply vote, like it was earlier, but they
really made a choice, giving their preference to candidates whose
pre-election platforms suited them better,'' Pravda said.
``Choosing people's deputies, the country voted for perestroika.''
   The official news agency Tass said candidates in 275 districts
failed to win the majority needed for a seat in the new
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies.
   ``Elections will be held May 14 in 199 electoral districts in
which neither of the two candidates running for parliament seats
won the majority,'' it said.
   In 76 districts with three or more candidates, none of whom got
a majority, runoffs will be held April 2 and April 9 between the
top two candidates in each race, the agency said.
   Sunday's vote was for 1,500 of the parliament seats. The other
750 were filled by the party and official institutions without
elections.
   Official results will not be released for several days, but the
news reports Wednesday added details about the rejection of party
and government officials.
   Those in the three largest cities _ Moscow, Leningrad and Kiev _
felt the sting of a frustrated public, as did at least 37 top local
officials around the country.
   Among the losers was Yuri Solovyev, a 59-year-old candidate
member of the ruling Politburo who ran unopposed in Leningrad but
was kept from a majority by voters who crossed his name off the
ballot.
   Tass gave the first detailed report Wednesday on Solovyev's
failure and said 11 other government candidates also lost in 21
races. It said Solovyev got 44 percent of the vote.
   Leningrad Mayor Vladimir Khodyrev told Tass his city's
candidates lost because the public was poorly informed about their
activity and voted on the basis of rumors and gossip.
   The poor fortune of official candidates could help Gorbachev by
emphasizing public frustration over the leadership and the slow
progress of reform.
   Reports from Byelorussia and Armenia, where citizen demands for
reform have created problems for the party establishment, indicated
the voters either rejected top official candidates or did not vote.
   Pravda said the losers included V. Galko, city party leader in
Minsk, the Byelorussian capital, and a first deputy premier of the
republic, Y. Khusainov. Voters also rejected party leaders in the
southern Gomel and Mogilev regions, which were affected by the 1986
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the neighboring Ukraine.
   Many citizens of Minsk were angered last fall by tough police
action against a new People's Front grassroots organization and
groups seeking to build a memorial to victims of Stalin's purges.
   In Armenia, voters stayed home to express frustration over a
lack of choice, the government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   ``At the very climax of the campaign, people asked a question
for which they did not receive a convincing answer,'' the newspaper
said.
   ``Why did a group of leaders of the republic, nominated as
candidates, have no opponents?,'' it said, and added: ``Many, as a
sign of protest, refused to take part in elections without a
choice.''
   In many parts of the Soviet Union 85 percent to 95 percent of
voters participated, but in Armenia the figure was 71.9. Only 53
percent voted in Yerevan, capital of the republic.
   Pravda said losers in the Soviet Far East included the party
leaders in Khabarovsk region and the Birobidzhan Jewish autonomous
region, the regional party leader in Chita, Siberia, and the leader
in the Tuymen oil-producing region of northwestern Siberia.

<HEAD>New Law Would Bar Police From Pretending to be Reporters</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A legislator Wednesday introduced a bill that
would make it illegal for police to impersonate journalists while
entering Arab villages to make arrests.
   The proposal comes amid a dispute between reporters and the
police after two reported instances last week in which plainclothes
policemen were seen with ``Press'' or ``TV'' signs in the windows
of their unmarked cars.
   Reporters usually put the signs in the windows to prevent
protesters from throwing rocks or firebombs on their vehicles while
covering the Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Parliamentarian Avraham Poraz, a member of the liberal Shinui
Party who proposed the bill, said the policemen's camouflage
practice could harm freedom of the press in Israel, curtailing the
usually outspoken media.
   ``It's important for journalists to be everywhere and have
access to information,'' he said.
   ``People come to journalists and tell them all kinds of things.
If they start thinking the journalist is really a policeman, they
won't talk ... and that could damage freedom of the press,'' Poraz
said.
   After last week's incidents involving police masquerading as
reporters, Police Inspector-General Krauss said the practice was
legal and would continue.
   But when Israeli journalists and foreign correspondents
protested, he agreed to limit the practice, requiring his personal
permission for using the tactic.
   The English-language Jerusalem Post criticized Krauss' position
in an editorial Wednesday.
   ``What the police inspector-general has sanctioned, in
principle, is the delegitimization of the press in its role as
observer of the Palestinian uprising,'' the newspaper said. ``That
this should be allowed in a democratic society is inconceivable.''
   Roni Shaked, head of a committee of journalists who cover the
territories, also argued the police practice endangers reporters.
   ``The security forces and police defend themselves with weapons
and steel helmets, and we have only our pens and the `Press'
signs,'' he said.
   Palestinian youths regularly stone cars with yellow Israeli
license plates, but they sometimes spare cars with ``Press'' signs.
   Reporters frequently have complained that Israeli security
agents and police masqueraded as journalists to move about the
occupied territories and make arrests.
   Authorities have denied the tactic was used, but the issue came
to a head last week when a British TV crew filmed the two police
with the ``TV'' sign on their car, then watched them arrest a
teen-age Palestinian girl.
   The idea also has apparently caught on among followers of the
anti-Arab former legislator, Rabbi Meir Kahane, who placed a
``Press'' sign in the window of their van, according to a
photograph in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper.
   In introducing his bill, Poraz noted that while impersonating
doctors or lawyers is illegal, no such protection exists for
journalists. His bill makes an exception for national security
cases, but even then a court's permission would be required.

<TEXT>
   A 31-story high-rise that sparked a three-year
fight between activists and a developer must have its top 12 floors
razed to comply with local law, a city agency has ruled.
   The Board of Standards and Appeals unanimously rejected
arguments by Parkview Associates that its Upper East Side building
receive a variance allowing it to override zoning laws.
   Parkview's attorney, Jay Segal, said Wednesday the firm would
not decide for at least a week whether to appeal Tuesday's decision
in the state Supreme Court. The firm has 30 days in which to
appeal. Supreme Court is New York state's trial-level court.
   Parkview, which has said it stands to lose $10 million by
dismantling the fought-over floors, had taken the fight to the U.S.
Supreme Court last year to avoid lopping off the 12 stories it had
topped off in 1986.
   Activists, who began the fight against the building, hailed the
decision as a warning to developers in Manhattan.
   ``This is a very strong message: zoning is not for sale. No more
indulging developers,'' said Genie Rice, president of the
neighborhood group Civitas. ``You can't decide to go ahead with a
project and then buy your way out.''
   Parkview had continued work on the building for two months in
the summer of 1986 while its permit was reviewed.
   The builder had offered to build about 40 low-income senior
citizen apartments in East Harlem in return for a zoning variance
leaving the building intact.
   The fight over the building began when Ms. Rice discovered the
building had been constructed in violation of local zoning laws
setting the limit for new buildings at 19 stories.
   Parkview Associates bought the site in 1982 and received a
construction permit for 31 stories in 1985 when city officials
misinterpreted a zoning map.
   When the case went into the courts, the New York state Court of
Appeals ruled the original permit was invalid and that the building
owner must share in the blame. ``Reasonable diligence'' by Parkview
would have discovered the correct zoning, the court ruled.
   The U.S. Supreme Court, without comment, left that ruling intact.
   If Parkview is unable to overturn the board's ruling, the
process for dismantling the extra floors would be the same used for
tearing down old buildings.
   Protective scaffolding is placed outside the building, with
workers going from the top down prying off the brick facing,
breaking the concrete floor into movable chunks and torching
through metalwork.

   After Congress resoundingly rejected a 51
percent pay raise last month, House Speaker Jim Wright was asked if
the issue would surface again.
   ``I hope not real soon,'' he said. ``I can count.''
   Seven weeks later, Wright and his colleagues are being asked to
count again. Most seem unwilling to do that.
   ``Will something get done this year? I doubt it,'' House
Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif., said Wednesday. ``Something
needs to be done but I'm not at all optimistic. And next year is an
election year; it's even worse.''
   Coelho, the Democrats' chief vote counter, was reacting to a new
raise proposal by a commission that studied the salaries of members
of Congress, federal judges and senior government executives.
President Bush welcomed the recommendations and said he would soon
offer specific proposals to the Congress.
   The commission, headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker, proposed raises of approximately 50 percent over two
years, not much different than the package killed last month after
a firestorm of citizen opposition.
   Rank-and-file members of Congress now are paid $89,500 a year; a
50 percent raise would boost congressional salaries to $135,000.
   Capitol Hill's initial reaction could best be summed up as
``thanks but no thanks.''
   Hardly a surprise, given the events of late January and early
February, following a proposal that congressional salaries be
raised by 51 percent.
   Opponents, notably radio talk show hosts, took little note of
the fact that the package also covered judges and managers of many
of the government's most important and sensitive programs. The
nation's anger was directed at Congress.
   The talk show hosts and their callers portrayed the lawmakers as
greedy do-nothings. Angry constituents flooded the Capitol mail
room with letters and tea bags to protest. Polls showed
overwhelming public opposition to the raises, which were due to
take effect automatically.
   Facing all that, Wright decided the pay plan should go to a
vote. The outcome was as inevitable as death and taxes.
   Afterward, Wright said it was time to move on. Bush seemed to
concur.
   ``What you don't want to do is come in and when the wounded are
still lying on the battlefield start fighting another battle,'' he
said then.
   Bush apparently believes now that the wounds have already healed.
   Coelho said Bush's leadership is vital to any hopes of passing
pay raises for members of Congress, federal judges and government
executives. But he quickly added that the president would have to
get Republicans in line before the Democratic leadership would
embrace a new pay plan.
   ``Everybody does their own thing around here instead of doing
what is in the best interests of the institution,'' Coelho said.
``You can get a lot of mileage out of opposing pay hikes if you're
thinking about running for the Senate from Iowa.''
   That was a shot at Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, a leading opponent
of the pay raises voted down last month.
   Coelho didn't say it, but hopes of winning a pay raise could
rest on getting Ralph Nader in line too.
   Nader led the talk show assault on the last pay raise package
and was quick to criticize the new one.
   ``President Bush should apply his flexible freeze philosophy to
the salaries of top government officials,'' the self-styled
consumer advocate said.
   Coelho, asked if any new attempt at pay raises would likely meet
the same fate as the last, replied:
   ``Sure. The Ralph Naders and the talk show hosts will prevail,''
   It's not that a majority of the lawmakers don't think they
deserve a hefty raise.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., drew a standing ovation last
month when he insisted, ``Each member of the House, Democrat and
Republican, is worth $135,000.''
   The question now is whether enough of the lawmakers think it's
worth trying again to convince the American public of that.
   Coelho doubts it.
   ``I count the votes and I don't count enough of them on either
side of the aisle,'' he said. ``We have a tendency to shoot
ourselves in the foot. We certainly have on this one.''

<HEAD>Scientists See Little Chance to Regain Contact with Mars Probe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

   Officials worked around the clock Wednesday to
restore contact with a space probe circling the Martian moon
Phobos, but hopes were fading that they could save the $500 million
project.
   A commission has been formed to determine the cause of the
failure of Phobos II and present its conclusions in a week, said
Sergei Zavgorodny, an official at Glavkosmos, the Soviet space
agency.
   In an interview with the newspaper Izvestia, Glavkosmos head
Alexander Dunayev said scientists were awaiting the commission's
findings before taking further action.
   Scientists at Moscow's Space Research Institute, which developed
the project to explore Mars and Phobos, its biggest moon, met
throughout the day Wednesday.
   One expert emerged and gave a gloomy assessment of the future of
the spacecraft, whose companion probe Phobos I became lost in space
in September after a ground controller sent an erroneous computer
command.
   ``The situation is bad and honestly, there are fewer and fewer
hopes. Chances to regain contact with the probe are very small,''
said Alexander Zakharov, a project scientist.
   A Soviet TV commentator suggested that Western news reports
claiming the problem was ``catastrophic'' were exagerrated and
cited successful studies by the craft of solar radiation and the
surface of Mars itself conducted before the communication failure.
   The report on the evening news program ``Vremya'' featured
detailed maps of the Martian surface compiled photos taken by the
spacecraft.
   Ground control has received sporadic radio signals from the
spacecraft, an unmanned spacecraft launched in July, but no regular
contact, he said.
   Izvestia said the problem occurred Monday when ground
controllers were trying to reorient the spacecraft to take
photographs of the Martian moon. After the maneuver, it said,
controllers were unable to contact the craft despite repeated
attempts.
   Dunayev said there were seven or eight possibilities as to why
communications failed. He did not elaborate, and efforts to reach
him were unsuccessful.
   Loss of Phobos II would be a severe setback for the $480 million
international Phobos project led by the Soviet Union. Twenty-two
countries and the European Space Agency have contributed technology
or experiments to the project, and the United States was helping
track the two craft with NASA's Deep Space Network.
   Loss of communications apparently would prevent Phobos II from
dropping two small landing craft onto the surface of the Martian
moon. Soviet news reports in January said the spacecraft was to
approach the moon next month to analyze its soil with a laser and
then release two landers.
   Roger Bonnet, science director of the Paris-based European Space
Agency, said ``there is some hope'' of regaining contact with
Phobos II. ``It's not zero,'' he added in an interview.
   ``It's a disappointment. But the Mars phase was a great success.
We obtained unique information on the surface of Mars, its
atmosphere, its magnetic field and its environment,'' Bonnet said.
   In Washington, NASA spokesman Jeff Vincent said the Soviets had
not asked the United States for help but that the agency's tracking
network is monitoring the craft. ``There is nothing we can do for
them,'' he said.
   Tass announced Jan. 30 that Phobos II went into orbit around
Mars the previous day after a six-month, 111 million-mile voyage
from Earth and was studying the planet's climate and soil.
   Soviet space officials have said the mission would help them
prepare a manned mission to Mars early in the 21st century.
   Phobos II was launched July 12 in a program to unlock mysteries
of the red planet and Phobos, Tass said. In December, Tass said
some instruments aboard Phobos II failed, but most were fixed and
the problems would not prevent the completion of its program.
   Phobos I was lost only three months after it was launched July
7, and ground controllers have been unable to communicate with it.

   Two police officers were buried in
Kosovo province on Wednesday in ceremonies that illustrated the
stark ethnic differences that divide the people of the troubled
region.
   In one village, an ethnic Albanian police officer was laid to
rest in an unmarked grave after a procession where the only women
allowed to be present were the victim's mother, wife and daughter.
   In another village, a Serbian officer was buried by a priest
following a church service attended by thousands of men and women.
   The only things the services shared were a deep sense of
mourning and a large police detail that frisked those attending for
concealed weapons.
   ``Perhaps the killing of an ethnic Albanian and a Serb will
serve to sober nationalist passions that have erupted in our
land,'' said a policeman guarding one of the funerals. He refused
to give his name.
   Officer Jetulah Kuchi, an ethnic Albanian, and officer Miroljub
Tanaskovic, a Serb, both died of gunshot wounds suffered during
clashes earlier this week between ethnic Albanians and police.
   Kuchi, 31, a father of four and the commander of the police
station in Podujevo, was buried in Suva Reka village in a Moslem
funeral.
   Most of the 200 mourners were ethnic Albanian men, wearing
traditional dome-shaped white hats and filing past his photograph
moments before the coffin was lowered into an unmarked grave _ in
keeping with Moslem customs.
   His mother, wife, and daughters were the only females allowed to
accompany the coffin, while other women relatives remained at home,
weeping loudly.
   Albanian men and boys lined the narrow, winding, unpaved streets
leading to the Moslem cemetery in Suva Reka, 40 miles south of
Pristina, as policemen carried the coffin on its last journey.
   Patrolman Tanaskovic was laid to rest hours later in a different
cemetery in accordance with the rites of the Serbian Orthodox
church.
   At least 5,000 Serbian men and women gathered around the
yellow-and-orange striped Orthodox church in Preoce, six miles
south of Pristina, to pay their last respects to Tanaskovic.
   The 34-year-old patrolman, married with one child, reportedly
died when a sniper shot him in the town of Titova Mitrovica. A
bearded Orthodox priest conducted part of the burial ceremony.
   People attending both funerals were frisked. In Suva Reka, at
least five Soviet-built T-55 stood guard to prevent further
demonstrations.
   At least 23 people were killed this week in clashes in Kosovo
province after the legislature in Kosovo, which is part of Serbia,
approved constitutional changes giving Serbia more control over the
province.
   Serbs said the changes were needed to protect them from
persecution at the hands of the ethnic Albanians, who are in the
majority. Ethnic Albanians said the changes robbed them of autonomy
they won in a 1974 constitution.

   Syrian forces blasted Lebanon's Christian
enclave with rocket fire Wednesday, ignoring a cease-fire called by
the army commander. The main Christian militia threatened to strike
back with ``double cruelty.''
   ``We are adhering to the truce despite the random Syrian
shelling that has targeted even hospitals,'' the army commander,
Gen. Michel Aoun, told a news conference. ``But our patience has
limits.''
   Aoun said the Syrian leadership was ``acting in a terrorist
way,'' and he said he would complain to the U.N. Security Council
and the Arab League.
   Salvos fired from multibarreled rocket launchers thundered over
the Lebanese capital all day, despite the truce Aoun proclaimed at
midnight in response to an Arab League appeal. The shelling
intensified at nightfall.
   ``We warn the aggressors who are entrenched inside residential
districts against this massive escalation,'' said the Lebanese
Forces, the Christians' main militia. ``If it continues, we will be
compelled to retaliate with double cruelty to stop these criminal
practices.''
   Police said two people were killed and 16 others were wounded in
the Syrian bombardment of east Beirut. Since the fighting began
March 8, 123 people have died and 388 have been injured.
   The U.S. Embassy said ambassador John McCarthy's residence in
the Christian suburb of Yarze was struck by a Syrian shell Tuesday
night, damaging the living quarters but causing no casualties.
   An embassy spokeswoman said McCarthy was in the bomb shelter at
the time.
   Col. Joseph Shidiak, who commands a police unit protecting
diplomats, said the Belgian and Turkish embassies near the
presidential palace in suburban Baabda and the residence of British
ambassador Alann Ramsay in Rabieh also were hit by Syrian rockets
this week. No casualties were reported.
   A communique by Aoun's headquarters said the latest bombardment
caught residents of east Beirut as they were emerging from shelters
to buy food and take stock of the damage from six straight nights
of attacks.
   Militiamen in Shweifat, just south of Beirut, from where Syrians
and allied Druse fighters have been firing into the Christian
heartland, appeared disgruntled.
   ``We do not like to kill our Lebanese brethren,'' said a fighter
with Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party,
who identified himself only as Abu Antar.
   ``We don't like this dirty war. Civilians are dying on both
sides,'' he said. ``The fighting can last for as long as we and
they have ammunition.''
   Police said at least 250,000 people have fled west and south
Beirut in recent days.
   The shelling has damaged power plants, leaving some areas in
total darkness and others with only a few hours of electricity a
day.
   The fighting began after Aoun clamped a blockade on illegal
ports operated by Moslem militias. These facilities have been
depriving the government of an estimated $100 million a year in tax
revenues.
   Syria keeps about 40,000 troops in northern and eastern
provinces as well as Moslem west Beirut under a 1976 Arab League
mandate to end the 14-year-old civil war.
   Christian leaders say Syria can no longer play the role of a
neutral peacekeeper because of its bias toward Moslems.
   The Moslem-Christian rift deepened six months ago when President
Amin Gemayel's six-year term expired and Parliament was unable to
elect a successor.
   Before he stepped down on Sept.22, Gemayel named Aoun head of an
interim military cabinet.
   Moslems and Syria rejected the appointment.

   Democrats rejoiced Wednesday over Jill Long's
surprise victory in a normally Republican congressional district in
Indiana while both political parties turned their attention to
elections next month in Alabama and Wyoming.
   Neither Democrats nor Republicans claimed any important national
trend in Tuesday's returns from Indiana, in which Long defeated
Republican Dan Heath by about 1,700 votes to capture the House seat
once held by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   But Republican Party Chairman Lee Atwater said he was
``ashamed'' at the loss of the seat that had been a safe one for
the GOP, and conceded that the race looked ``very tough'' next week
in a heavily Democratic region of Alabama. Other Republicans
insisted their candidate was an underdog in the Wyoming race, even
though the seat has been in GOP hands for a decade.
   Democratic spokesman Mike McCurry said his side holds the upper
hand going into the final week of the Alabama campaign. He said if
Atwater is ashamed of the outcome of the Indiana race, he'd be
``apoplectic'' if the Democrats followed up with wins in Alabama
and Wyoming.
   In strict numerical terms, the outcome of the three races will
make scant difference in the House, where the Democratic majority
will stand at 259-174 when Long is sworn in next week.
   But that didn't stop the party professionals from scrutinizing
the Indiana returns or vying for public relations advantage in the
two elections to come.
   ``It's hard to read this as a referendum on George Bush but on
the other hand absent a strong national Republican agenda, these
local candidates don't have much to stand on,'' McCurry said.
   ``Obviously, we regret the loss,'' said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater. He said that the race ``reflected a lot of local
issues. ... But I don't think we would read much more into it.''
   Long, who received congratulations from Quayle in a telephone
call, told reporters the contest was ``just a race between two
individuals in northeast Indiana.''
   Long, a 36-year-old business professor who had twice been
defeated in congressional campaigns, will take the House seat given
up by Republican Dan Coats, who was appointed to the Senate after
Quayle was elected vice president.
   Alabama's election next Tuesday pits Democrat Glen Browder
against Republican John Rice to fill the seat vacated by the death
of longtime Democratic Rep. Bill Nichols.
   The Wyoming election April 26 is to choose between Democrat John
Vinich and Republican Craig Thomas to succeed Dick Cheney, who
resigned from Congress when he was confirmed as defense secretary.
   Republicans have won five of the last six presidential
elections, but ``haven't figured out how to translate national
strength into state and local strength,'' said McCurry, spokesman
at the DNC.
   The GOP used personal campaigning by Quayle, Coats and Barbara
Bush in an unsuccessful effort to hold the Indiana seat, and Heath
aired a television commercial featuring the president.
   But several Republicans said Long was successful because she was
better known to the voters, ran an aggressive campaign and
capitalized on key local issues _ particularly her complaints about
a local tax increase.
   ``The Republican Party is not going to regain control of
Congress by running against (House Speaker) Jim Wright and
injecting George Bush into every race,'' said Mark Helmke, a
Republican consultant with longtime ties to Indiana.
   Atwater said, ``I have no excuses. We should have won that race.
I am very surprised we lost it.''
   Atwater added that ``we didn't have the best candidate. We
didn't run the best campaign and on some issues, we got snookered.''
   John Buckley, spokesman at the Republican Congressional Campaign
Committee, said the result in Indiana and the possiblity of a
follow-up Democratic triumph in Alabama ``puts more visibility on
Wyoming.'' He said his organization would spend the maximum allowed
by law _ $104,000 _ on the race there, and claimed the underdog's
role for Thomas.
   Vinich narrowly lost a bid to defeat Sen. Malcolm Wallop in
November and is better known to the voters, he said.
   As for Alabama, ``we have a very tough row to hoe,'' and he
noted that 70,000 votes were cast in the Democratic primary to pick
a general election candidate and only about 18,000 in the
Republican primary.
   At the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Rep. Beryl
Anthony of Arkansas issued a statement recommending that
Republicans spend more time protecting their own seats than
``wasting time with their grandiose plans to target Democrats they
have no chance to win.'' That was a reference to a recent
declaration by Republican campaign boss Edward Rollins that Wright
would be a major target of Republican efforts in 1990.

<HEAD>Courts Allows Unemployment Pay for People Shunning Sabbath Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States may not deny unemployment benefits to
people who refuse to work on their Sabbath _ even if the refusal is
not based on a religious sect's doctrine, the Supreme Court said
Wednesday.
   The court ruled unanimously that Illinois officials violated a
Peoria man's religious freedom when denying him unemployment
benefits.
   ``I'm thrilled,'' said William Frazee after learning of his
legal victory. ``I am thankful for the Lord's faithfulness.''
   In a series of previous decisions, the justices had barred
states from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse
certain work because of religious scruples.
   But in all previous cases, the workers' refusal was based on the
teachings of an established religious group such as the Seventh-day
Adventists or the Jehovah's Witnesses.
   Writing for the court Wednesday, Justice Byron R. White said the
court's previous rulings never suggested that people who refrain
from work because of religious scruples are ineligible for
unemployment benefits unless they belong to a religious group that
forbids such work.
   The ruling means, for example, that a Methodist or Roman
Catholic might be eligible for unemployment benefits after refusing
to work on Sunday even though neither church bars work on the
Sabbath as part of its official doctrine.
   Frazee was disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits
after turning down a temporary job assignment in 1984 that would
have required him to work on Sunday.
   Frazee said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of
Christianity is that non-emergency work on Sundays is forbidden.
   The Illinois Department of Employment Security ruled that
Frazee's rejection of the job offer disqualified him from receiving
unemployment benefits.
   State officials, while not questioning Frazee's sincerity, said
a refusal to work due to religious scruples must be based ``on some
tenet or dogma accepted by the individual of some church, sect or
denomination'' _ and not based merely on personal religious
convictions.
   Frazee sued, and Illinois courts ruled against him. But the
Supreme Court said the state courts were wrong.
   White rejected arguments by state officials that a victory for
Frazee would lead to Americans seeking Sundays off because they
want to shop, play sports or even watch football on television.
   ``We are unpersuaded that there will be a mass movement away
from Sunday employ if William Frazee succeeds in his claim,'' White
said.
   Ironically, Frazee now is employed with the state Department of
Employment Security.
   He said he still opposes Sunday work ``unless one is involved in
an essential service.''
   ``If I were a doctor, ambulance driver or the like I would have
no qualms but those jobs preserve and protect life,'' he said.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled in an Oklahoma case that state, not federal, courts have
the initial authority to rule on a state's efforts to tax bingo
games and cigarette sales conducted by Indians outside a
reservation.
   _Ordered a federal appeals court to restudy the case of
convicted a Georgia murderer who is seeking to overturn his death
sentence for a 1974 killing.

<HEAD>This Tape Will Self-Destruct</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reminiscent of the ``Mission Impossible''
television series, a major film company plans to test-market a
videocassette that will self-destruct after the movie has been
watched a et number of times.
   MGM-UA Home Video has decided to test the ``disposable'' tapes
this summer in an undisclosed city, according to Herb Fischer, vice
president of sales and marketing.
   The mission of the new videocassette _ should studios decide to
accept it _ will be to encourage the production companies to sell
video rental stores more copies of a movie for the same price they
would pay for tapes with unlimited play. That would make it easier
for movie renters nationwide to find a hot new release at their
video stores.
   ``It saves you going back three times to get the same film,''
said Steve Roberts, president of the Los Angeles-based S. Roberts
Co.
   The company is consulting on the project for Rank Video Services
America, a manufacturing duplicating company based in Torrance,
Calif., that licensed the patent to the new product.
   Although these tapes will not go up in smoke when the limited
number of plays are completed, they will erase themselves and
cannot then be re-recorded, said Roberts.
   ``It becomes inoperative as a normal cassette,'' said Bob
Pfannkuch, chairman of Rank Video Services America. He said the
technology for this type of videocassette has been around for three
to five years.
   However, it will be the first test-marketing of this type of
tape that could have a profound influence in the $8 billion
videocassette industry. The first title has not yet been selected.
   Introduction of the new tapes, which will have green cases to
distinguish them from the typical black cases, could meet strong
initial demand for popular movies, said Roberts.
   He said retailers lose from 5-20 percent of their potential
business because frustrated customers who cannot find their
first-choice movie leave without renting anything.
   A retail outlet currently pays more than $60 for a movie title
and cannot afford to stock it in depth. However, with the
disposable tapes programmed at 20 plays, that retailer could buy
the same movie for about $30, he said.
   ``The goal of this is not to replace the traditional black
tapes,'' said Roberts, who explained that retailers would still buy
the permanent tapes but would also purchase the green disposable
movies for ``depth of copy.''
   However, the head of a nationwide organization of independent
video retailers said the reported problem of overwhelming demand
for popular movies has been overstated.
   ``Our consumer surveys show that customers are generally happy
and that 60 to 70 percent of the time they get their tape,'' said
John Power, president of the non-profit, 2,500-member American
Video Association, based in Chandler, Ariz.
   ``The disposable tape in theory is being promoted in a way that
could sound attractive to retailers,'' Power said Wednesday. But
retailers are concerned that marketers could eventually decide to
make all their videocassettes disposable, something his
organization would find intolerable, Power said.
   The price of the disposable tapes will be set as they are passed
along from studios to wholesalers and finally to retailers. Roberts
said rental fees probably will not be affected, but customers will
have to be more cautious about rewinding.
   The disposable tapes can be rewound up to 20 minutes into the
movie without triggering the counter that marks the number of
plays. After that, any rewinding would count as a play, said
Roberts.
   None of the principals involved would reveal any other specifics
of the technology involved in the disposable tapes, other than to
explain that the movies would be preset to play a number of times
ranging from 15 to 60.

<HEAD>Congress Asked for $1.1 Billion More for Veterans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has asked Congress for
a $1.1 billion supplemental appropriation for the Veterans Affairs
Department for the current fiscal year, the department announced
Wednesday.
   Some of the money already had been announced by members of
Congress, including a $303 million request for the department's
medical care arm.
   Officials said last fall that the more than $10 billion
allocated in the regular appropriation was not going to be enough
to maintain care for veterans whose income is enough to put them at
the end of the line for care in the 172 hospitals of the veterans'
system.
   At the time, the shortfall was estimated at $600 million to $1
billion.
   The department has been raiding supply and equipment accounts to
pay salaries while the administration decided how much money to
seek. Approval of the $303 million will end those bookkeeping
raids, the department said.
   Of the balance of the request, $701 million is for increased
pension and other benefit payments to meet the 4.1 percent increase
mandated by Congress effective Dec. 1. Such a supplemental
appropriation is an annual routine.
   Some $22 million of the increase would be allocated to
readjustment programs and $130 million to loan guarantee programs.
   Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said he expected ``swift
approval'' of the request, which would bring his department's
spending this year to $29.2 billion.

<HEAD>US Wants Contras to Return Home to Do Political Battle with Sandinistas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department acknowledged Wednesday
that it is encouraging leaders of the Nicaraguan Contras to return
to their homeland and do battle with the leftist Sandinista
government in the political, rather than military, arena.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Bush
administration ``supports the willingness of individual resistance
leaders, or the leadership as a whole, to voluntarily return to
Nicaragua to participate in the political process.''
   She said ``it is important to test the Nicaraguan government's
intention'' to carry out its promises of democratization, and
called on ``the international community'' to ``lend its full
support and protection'' to those who return by monitoring their
treatment inside Nicaragua.
   A five-nation regional peace agreement calls for political
reforms inside Nicaragua leading to a free and open campaign and
national elections in February 1990, and one of the seven Contra
political directors said he and three colleagues are likely to
accept that challenge.
   ``We need a unified candidacy'' to mount an effective opposition
to the ruling leftist Sandinista party, said Alfredo Cesar, a
member of the Nicaraguan Resistance political directorate.
   Cesar said he would return to Nicaragua in May if promised
changes in election and communications law are accomplished and if
the presidents of the five Central American countries come up with
a suitable plan for eventual repatriation of Contra fighters.
   He said he would not himself seek election, but would work to
bring together the many political parties in the splintered
opposition behind a candidate who can bridge the broad spectrum of
political beliefs in the country. ``We need someone who is above
politics,'' he said, but declined to name who might fit that
description.
   And he said, based on private conversations with other members
of the directorate, three others in the Contra political leadership
also were likely to return and involve themselves in the campaign
leading to national elections next February. The other three
probably will not go back, he said.
   The Bush administration, seeking to implement a new bipartisan
policy approach to Central America worked out with Congress last
week, is pressing the rebel leaders to return to Nicaragua and is
cutting by at least half the money the United States now spends to
support the rebels' political activities in exile.
   Cesar said that means U.S. support will drop from $400,000 a
month to about $200,000, necessitating the laying off of employees
and the possible closing of some offices.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater confirmed the new policy
direction Wednesday, saying, ``We'd like to see the focus go now to
the political and diplomatic affairs of Nicaragua. ... We would
like to see the leadership integrated back into the political
society there.''
   As a further step toward translating the new policy into action,
President Bush will meet at the White House next week with Costa
Rican President Oscar Arias, the author of a regional peace accord,
said Fitzwater.
   Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts,
will stop in Washington en route to Canada to discuss the status of
the regional peace process and how the new administration policy
fits in.
   In addition, Bush plans to meet in the next few weeks with
Alfredo Cristiani, the president-elect of El Salvador who won
election last week as the candidate of the rightist Arena party,
Fitzwater said.
   Under the new policy, the Contras are being urged to join the
internal political opposition in their country and become
contenders in next year's elections.
   ``Even though it's only at the suggestion level, it's a very
strong suggestion,'' Cesar said in a telephone interview. ``The
message is that they will no longer support political activities in
exile. The only ones they will support are ones conducted inside
Nicaragua as part of the political opposition there.''
   Cesar said that message was delivered to the rebels at a State
Department meeting when the seven members of the directorate were
in Washington two weeks ago. It was repeated in stronger terms when
a State Department delegation traveled to Miami to meet again with
the group last Friday _ at the same time Bush was announcing a new
policy toward Nicaragua at the White House.
   ``The whole idea behind that is that political activity should
be transferred inside Nicaragua, which is where the testing arena
is now'' said Cesar.
   The new policy, arrived at after weeks of meetings with
congressional leaders, calls for a 10-month renewal of humanitarian
aid to the rebels troops now based in border camps just inside
neighboring Honduras.
   But it also commits the United States to support a peace process
undertaken by the five countries in the region and permits the
rebel aid to be used to relocate the fighters into their homeland
when political conditions there improve.

<HEAD>Bush Says Parents Don't Deserve Tax Break for Paying Private School
Tuition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday that parents
don't deserve a tax break for paying tuition to send their children
to private schools. ``Can't afford to do that,'' he said.
   ``Everybody should support the public school system and then, if
on top of that, your parents think that they want to shell out in
addition to the tax money, tuition money, that's their right,''
Bush told a student group. ``But I don't think they should get a
break for that.''
   He said ``it is the obligation of all taxpayers to support a
public education system.''
   The Reagan administration had supported the idea of tuition tax
credits for parents who send their children to private schools, but
dropped the idea in a major overhaul of the tax system.
   Bush made his comments in a question and answer session with 75
students spending a week in Washington as part of a program to give
youths an inside look at government. The program is sponsored by
Close Up, a non-partisan, educational foundation.
   Joseph Thill, a student at the Hawaii Preparatory Academy, told
Bush that his parents pay his tuition but also have to pay taxes
for public education, and asked whether they should get a tax break.
   ``No, no they shouldn't,'' Bush replied.
   Bush said he wanted the public education system ``to be the
best, and I think in many ways it is the best, although I am
disturbed when I see some kids underachieving, not being able to
identify where the United States is on the globe or something of
that nature.''
   He said he had been intrigued by the concept of tuition tax
credits for private institutions including parochial schools.
   However, he said, ``can't afford to do that'' because of the big
budget deficit.
   Bush also said that the federal government should not be the
``final arbiter'' on educational matters, insisting that role
should be filled by states and local communities.
   On another subject, Bush, who has said he wants to wipe out
illiteracy within eight years, said, ``I don't think the federal
government can eliminate it.'' He said it will require resources
beyond government, including help from corporations and others.

   The United States on Wednesday welcomed a call
by the Arab League for a cease-fire in Lebanon and urged all
warring groups to comply.
   ``We strongly support that call, and we share the Arab League's
concern about the grave situation in Lebanon,'' said a State
Department statement. ``The shelling must stop and the land and sea
blockades must end.
   Syrian gunners and their Druse allies have been trading
artillery fire with Christian army units in Beirut since March 8 in
the worst sectarian fighting the country has known in four years.
   The Christians, headed by Gen. Michel Aoun, have blockaded
southern ports used by Moslem militias, and the Moslems have
retaliated with a counter-blockade of the Christian enclave in the
north.
   The United States views the lifting of the blockades as vital to
restoring some calm to Beirut so the sides can negotiate a
cease-fire.
   ``All parties to the fighting must negotiate their differences
with one another. Further civilian casualities and suffering must
be avoided at all cost,...'' the statement said. Lebanese police
say 122 people have been killed in the fighting and 376 injured.
   The U.S. statement reiterated U.S. willingness ``to assist'' the
Arab League's peace initiative ``however we can.'' U.S. officials
say assistance would be in the form of using what influence the
United States has to get the warring parties to talk to each other.
   ``We can't do it for them,'' said one official. ``We can push
them to get into the same room, we can urge them, but we can't
solve their problem,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The United States is also consulting with other countries who
wield some influence on Syria and on the Lebanese Christians, he
said.

<TEXT>
   The rapid growth of U.S. aquaculture that
began a decade ago slowed in 1988, largely because of less
expansion in the catfish industry, the Agriculture Department said
Wednesday.
   Overall, U.S. production of edible and non-edible aquaculture
products increased only 40 million pounds last year, compared with
a 1987 growth of more than 100 million pounds, the department's
Economic Research Service said in a preliminary report.
   ``Slower growth in the catfish industry, which accounts for
about 45 percent of U.S. aquaculture production, was principally
responsible for the less rapid total expansion,'' the report said.
   The slowdown in catfish was partly offset by stronger growth in
some other aquaculture products such as salmon, tilapia and striped
bass.
   Despite the throttling back in catfish production, total 1988
output grew 5.2 percent to a record 295 millon pounds, the report
said. Catfish growth was more than 32 percent in 1987 and 11
percent in 1986.
   Catfish production was accompanied by a 23.6 percent increase in
prices paid farmers by processors in 1988. Those price averages
ranged from $1.61 per pound in California to 71 cents in Louisiana.
   ``However, higher feed and energy costs led to a 20 percent to
25 percent increase in production costs, which meant that net
returns (to farmers) were only 5 percent to 10 percent higher,''
the report said.
   Trout producers surveyed by the agency sold 58.9 million pounds
with a value of $63.6 million between Sept. 1, 1987, and Aug. 31,
1988, the report said. Producers also sold more than 361 million
trout eggs worth $2.8 million.
   Production of pen-raised salmon was estimated at six million
pounds in 1988, a 70 percent increase from 1987. The report said
domestic salmon production ``will probably continue to see large
gains'' in the next few years.
   Imports of fish and shellfish products last year were estimated
at $4.5 billion, down from $5.4 billion in 1987.
   ``This marks the first decline in the value of imported fishery
products in six years,'' the report said. ``At the same time, U.S.
exports of fishery products have increased from $1.5 billion to $2
billion.''
   The higher export value resulted from the decline in the value
of the U.S. dollar overseas, making U.S. products less expensive in
foreign markets, the report said.

   ``First time they've been out of that room'' where they were

``Everybody knows its better to have five girls than five boys,''
she joked.
   ``It's really been wonderful, very interesting,'' the president
said.
   The Bushes have decided to give the puppies away to some of

basis.
   Mrs. Bush said the children claiming the puppies will have the
right to name them, and that so far, only one _ ``Pickles'' _ has

<TEXT>
   The World Bank is planning to spend $186
million on rebuilding its headquarters, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   William Brannigan of the bank's information staff said he hopes
work can start by the end of this year to remodel the headquarters.
One of the four buildings to be replaced dates back to 1941.
   The bank's main entrance faces the main building of its sister
organization, the International Monetary Fund. They are just below
Pennsylvania Avenue on 19th Street, three blocks west of the White
House.
   The bank plans eventually to put 1,900 permanent employees to
its new buildings from offices it now rents elsewhere in
Washington, in addition to the 3,000 workers in the old ones.
   When the six-year project is completed, it will save $30 million
a year on rent, Brannigan added. He eplained the job will be done
slowly to disrupt the bank's work as little as possible.
   The new headquarters will have 1.5 million square feet. A
competition is being held for the design.
   The bank is owned by governments, with nearly 20 percent of the
shares held by the United States. It is the biggest source of
lending to Third World countries and approved more than $19 billion
in loans last year. The bank turns a profit by borrowing money on
world markets and putting it out at higher rates of return, both
from borrowing governments and from business investments.

   A court-appointed physician will re-examine
former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos because the results of
his first physical could be outdated, a prosecutor said Wednesday.
   ``This is just to confirm the reports of his health and to
update our own information because the other exam was so long
ago,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella, the lead
prosecutor in the government's criminal racketeering case against
the ousted leader.
   Marcos, 71, has been hospitalized at St. Francis Medical Center
here since Jan. 15 for treatment of respiratory and heart ailments.
He remained in guarded condition Wednesday in the hospital's
intensive care unit.
   Marcos and his wife, Imelda, are accused of stealing more than
$100 million from their homeland and stashing much of it in the
United States.
   Mrs. Marcos pleaded innocent to the charges and is free on $5
million bail, but Marcos' ill health has prevented his arraignment.
His attorneys say he is too sick to ever stand trial and have asked
U.S. District Judge John Keenan of New York for Marcos' conditional
removal from the case, meaning he would only be prosecuted if he
recovers.
   Keenan has yet to rule on that request.
   Court-appointed physician Francis Weld, of New York's Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center, examined Marcos in October found him
fit to stand trial. Weld said Marcos appeared to be faking some
symptoms and that he could not account for some of the pain Marcos
claimed to be suffering.
   Since then, Marcos has suffered several bouts of congestive
heart failure, a lung collapse and other respiratory ailments. He
was hospitalized briefly twice before his latest hospitalization,
which began Jan. 15.
   Last month, lung specialist Dr. George Druger said Marcos had a
50 percent chance of ever leaving the hospital and a 10 percent
chance of living another year.
   LaBella said Weld would probably re-examine Marcos in Honolulu
on April 1, although defense attorney John Bartko said the date had
not been agreed upon.

   A research and lobbying group opposed to
abortion asked Bush administration officials on Wednesday to
investigate the use of abortion as a means of choosing the sex of a
baby.
   The Family Research Council cited news reports as showing ``a
significant trend'' toward sex-selection abortions and said ``the
evidence suggests that it is overwhelmingly female fetuses'' that
are being aborted.
   The group sent letters to Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
and Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan, asking that
the practice be investigated as a possible violation of civil
rights.
   ``For unborn female babies to be aborted solely because they are
female is a grotesque form of discrimination that should not be
permitted in a society committed to equal rights,'' said the letter
signed by Gary L. Bauer, who joined the council as president last
year after serving as President Reagan's domestic policy adviser.
   He said that at the least the government should cut off federal
funding of any medical facility allowing abortions on the basis of
sex.
   ``Our society should not tolerate discriminatory medical
practices aimed at minorities or women in any of those
institutions. Clearly, abortions based on the sex of the child is a
fatal form of discrimination,'' he said.
   The sex of a fetus can be determined through amniocentesis or a
newer test called chorionic villus sampling, or CVS, which can make
the determination earlier than amniocentesis.

<HEAD>Astronomers Say Star May Have Exploded Near Sun During Solar System
Birth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unusual chemical composition found in
Halley's Comet suggests that a star may have exploded near the sun
during the formation of the solar system some 4.6 billion years
ago, according Arizona State University astronomers.
   Susan Wyckoff, Arizona State professor of physics and astronomy,
said Wednesday that a spectrum analysis of elements in Halley's
Comet shows that its ratio of carbon isotopes is unlike any tested
elsewhere in the solar system.
   This suggests, she said, a supernova exploded near the sun and
contaminated the gas cloud that later condensed to form the planets
and other objects orbiting near the sun.
   ``If this hypothesis is correct, it means that when the sun
formed, it didn't form as an isolated star,'' said Wychkoff. ``Like
many other stars we know in the galaxy, the sun may have formed in
a group or cluster of stars.''
   One or more of the other stars in the cluster could have become
a supernova. In such stellar explosions, she said, new chemical
elements are formed and ejected. If this occurred near enough to
contaminate the cloud from which the Earth and other parts of the
solar system formed, then traces of those chemical isotopes would
be found on those bodies.
   Halley's Comet would have escaped this supernova contamination
because it is believed to have formed in a region called the Kuiper
belt, which is about 100 times farther from the sun than Pluto, the
outermost of the planets.
   Wyckoff said the possibility of a supernova around the time of
the solar system formation is speculation based on the difference
in the ratios of the isotopes carbon 12 and carbon 13. The ratio is
89 parts of carbon 12 to one part carbon 13 in Earth and lunar
samples, in meteorites and in the atmospheres of the planets
Jupiter and Saturn.
   However, the carbon ratio in Haley's Comet was found to be only
65-to-1, she said.
   The most logical explanation for this difference, said Wyckoff,
is that the sun had a companion star that exploded. She cautioned,
however, that more sampling is needed to confirm this speculation.
   ``The 65 is found only in Halley's comet, but it is the only
comet that has been looked at,'' said Wyckoff. ``The 89 ratio is
found in virtually every other object that has been looked at.''
   The astronomer said these ratio differences could also be
explained if Halley's Comet formed outside the solar system and
then, through some gravitation perturbation, became trapped in an
orbit of the sun. Wyckoff said this is considered ``improbable''
because of the great distances between the sun and other stars.
   Wyckoff said the speculation will be tested this summer when
another periodic comet, called Brorsen-Metcalf, makes its near-pass
by the sun.
   She said astronomers will use the same technique used on
Halley's to sample the chemistry of the cloud boiling out from
Brorsen-Metcalf as the comet zips past the sun.
   Wyckoff said astronomers can sample the chemistry of a comet by
using a powerful telescope to capture light reflected from the
cloud around the object and then breaking this light into its
wavelengths through a sensitive instrument. Each chemical isotope
has a specific spectrum signature, enabling experts to measure the
chemical ratios, she said.
   The comet study is being conducted by Wyckoff and Peter A.
Wehinger of Arizona State; Eric Lindholm of Princeton, Jean-Marc
Zucconi and Michel C. Festou of France, and Australian astronomer
Bruce A. Peterson. A report on the finding is published in the
April 1 issue of the Astrophysical Journal.

   China will grant an exit visa to a former diplomat
whose pregnant Italian wife has been staging a protest in a camper
outside the Chinese Embassy, a diplomatic counseler said Wednesday.
   Patrizia Riccardi has been been living in the camper for more
than a week to try to persuade Chinese authorities to give a visa
to Zhu Juwang, who quit his post at the United Nations in Geneva.
   China contends Zhu, 28, resigned voluntarily and that they
replaced his diplomatic passport with an ordinary one after his
marriage to Ms. Riccardi last year in Beijing. The second passport
was confiscated after he wrote a letter to the United Nations that
the Chinese contend is scandalous.
   In the letter, he reportedly says he was forced to quit his job
because of his marriage to a foreigner.
   Zu Zuginshun, who identified himself as a diplomatic counselor
at the embassy, said officials in Beijing told the embassy they
would lelt Zhu leave when the embassy informed central authorities
that Zhu's father-in-law in Naples had found him a job.
   The father-in-law phoned the embassy Tuesday about the job, Zu
said.
   He said Zhu did not want to resign the embassy job and wanted
another post.
   ``The problem is all resolved,'' Zu said in an interview. ``He
can leave at any moment.''
   An hour after the interview, a friend of Ms. Riccardi said she
had not been told yet of any decision.
   Earlier in the week, an official at the Italian Embassy in
Beijing said the Chinese informed the embassy they were discussing
the matter with the United Nations in Geneva and New York and would
issue Zhu a passport once the question about his resignation is
clarified.

<HEAD>Mideast Missile Race Said to Threaten Israeli Superiority</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A missile race in the Middle East is eroding
Israel's aerial supremacy and ``could dramatically change the
balance of power'' in the region, Jane's Defense Weekly said
Wednesday.
   It said Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia have missiles that
could reach Israel and ``Libya is rushing to catch up, introducing
even more unpredictability.''
   Arab countries are pursuing billion-dollar arms programs
emphasizing missile development, Jane's said.
   Israel has possibly 100 nuclear weapons and its survival always
has depended on air supremacy, the respected military affairs
weekly reported.
   ``The acquisition by Iran and major Arab military powers of
increasingly sophisticated missiles capable of carrying nuclear
warheads is eroding Israel's technological superiority,
particularly its traditional supremacy in the air,'' it said.
   According to Jane's, this has forced Israel ``to consider
fundamental changes in its military strategy.''
   Through U.S. aid and participation in research on space-based
defense, ``Israel is trying to develop an anti-missile missile,''
Jane's said, and its launch last year of a satellite with potential
stretagic applications ``alarmed the Arabs.''
   It said ``the equation changed significantly last year'' when
Saudi Arabia disclosed it had Chinese-made DF-3A (CSS-2) missiles
with a range of nearly 1,700 miles and capable of carrying
1.3-megaton nuclear warheads or 5,290 pounds of high explosive.
   ``The DF-3As were intended as defense against Iran, although
they can easily reach Israel,'' the weekly said.
   Growing arms industries in Brazil, Argentina, China, Israel and
some Arab countries undermine efforts by major industrialized
nations to limit Third World access to missile technology and
restrict systems to a 180-mile range and 1,100-pound payload,
Jane's reported.
   Iraq and Egypt are working with Argentina to develop a missile,
based on Argentina's Condor-II system, with a range of 625 miles
and a 3,300-pound warhead that could carry nuclear or chemical
weapons, it said.
   The weekly said Libya was reported to be negotiating with Brazil
for Oteiba missiles, which have a range of 235 miles, and cited
reports that China is helping Iran build a plant to manufacture
500-mile-range missiles. Iran already has Chinese-made C-801 and
C-601 anti-ship missiles, it said.
   Iran, Syria, Iraq, Jordan and Libya have Soviet Scud missiles
with 190-mile range, Jane's said, and ``some, with Egyptian and
North Korean assistance, have extended their range with strap-on
boosters.''
   Iraq was believed to have done that in the late stages of its
war with Iran, in which a truce was reached last August.
   Syria has more than 100 Scuds plus an estimated 36 Scarab
missiles that could reach Israeli cities, the magazine said.
   Israel's nuclear-capable Jericho-I missiles have a range of 375
miles and it has tested an advanced version with an estimated range
of 1,000 miles, the magazine said. It added that the Israelis also
have about 150 U.S.-made Lance missiles with a range of 60 miles.

<HEAD>10 Paintings Vandalized In Dutch Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DORDRECHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A knife-wielding man Wednesday
slashed 10 Dutch paintings from the 17th century, including several
by pupils of Rembrandt, a museum spokesman said.
   ``It is an enormous disaster,'' said Willem de Paus, a spokesman
for the Dordrecht Museum, estimating the damage at ``many millions
of dollars.''
   The attacker, a 61-year-old unemployed man, slashed paintings by
Albert Cuyp, Nicolaas Maes, and Ferdinand Bol in the latest among
several recent thefts and acts of vandalism in Dutch museums.
   The man, who was not identified further under Dutch judicial
practice, was being held in nearby Papendrecht after he gave
himself up to police. His motive was not known.
   De Paus was unable immediately to identify the paintings by
title.
   The man entered the museum about 1:45 p.m. and inflicted ``very
bad damage'' to the paintings displayed in three rooms before he
was spotted by a guard via a remote television camera, De Paus said.
   Two guards tried to overpower the attacker, but he managed to
escape by threatening them with the knife, according to De Paus.
   ``They're really very heavily damaged, from some of them he cut
whole chunks, and others have large diagonal slashes,'' De Paus
said. It was ``too early'' to establish whether the paintings were
beyond repair, he said.
   The damaged paintings were from the core of the museum's
collection, Paus said.
   In December, three paintings by Vincent van Gogh were stolen
from the Netherlands' Kroeller-Mueller museum. The works have not
been recovered.
   In May, three paintings, among them a van Gogh and a work by
Paul Cezanne, were stolen from Amsterdam's Municipal Museum. They
were recovered 11 days later.
   The incidents have raised concern over security in Dutch
museums, where government budget cuts have seriously reduced
staffing levels.

<HEAD>Doctor: Duarte Should Survive Cancer Until Term Ends</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Napoleon
Duarte's cancer is worsening but he should live long enough to hand
over power to his successor on June 1, his doctor said Wednesday.
   Duarte, 63, has completed his eighth round of chemotherapy at
Walter Reed Hospital in Washington and already has outlived the
prognosis given when his terminal liver cancer was diagnosed last
year, said Dr. Jose Luis Saca.
   ``Duarte's condition is worsening, but he should live out his
presidency,'' Saca said in an interview.
   He is to hand power over to President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of
the rival Republican Nationalist Alliance on June 1.
   Duarte went to Washington for treatment the day after the March
19 election in which Cristiani's rightist party trounced Duarte's
Christian Democratic candidate, Fidel Chavez Mena.
   ``There has been a deteriorating of the president's health,''
Saca said.
   Doctors at Walter Reed diagnosed Duarte's cancer during
exploratory surgery in May. He was given about six to eight months
to live.
   ``The president has surpassed the statistics,'' Saca noted.
   Saca said the cancer has spread in the president's liver but not
to other organs. He said doctors who examined Duarte this month
``found that the damage to the liver was quite extensive.''
   Despite his illness, Duarte should be able to govern until the
inauguration, Saca said.
   Saca said Duarte's disease ``is irreversible and only God knows
how long he will live. We can only alleviate the pain. But I
believe that he has the ability to keep working.''
   Duarte was elected to a single, five-year term in 1984. The
Legislative Assembly would appoint an interim successor should
Duarte die before the end of his term.

   A skeleton thought possibly to be

art student who disappeared nearly nine years ago.
   Police said the bones found in thick undergrowth at Beachy Head
cliff on England's south coast on Saturday were those of Jessie
Victoria Earl, who was 22 when she disappeared in May 1980. She
lived in nearby Eastbourne and was last seen by a neighbor.
   Lord Lucan is still sought on a murder warrant issued after his
wife's nanny, Sandra Rivett, was battered to death at his London
home in 1974.
   A car borrowed by the earl was found abandoned at Newhaven near
Beachy Head, 18 miles south of Uckfield, where he was last seen.
   Police said they have reopened files on Miss Earl, whose remains
were identified from dental records.
   They said a pathologist told detectives there were no obvious
signs of violence but he was unable to give a cause, a place or a
time of death.

<HEAD>Canal Commission Chairman Cancels Board Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal Commission chairman announced
Wednesday he was canceling a board meeting because of harassment by
Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega against waterway employees.
   The meeting of the five Americans and four Panamanians on the
board that oversees the canal's operations was scheduled in
Baltimore on April 5 and 6. All of the members, known as directors,
are appointed by the U.S. president.
   ``This decision is the result of the numerous unprecedented
actions'' by Noriega against canal employees, said chairman William
R. Gianelli.
   ``If Noriega keeps putting this pressure on canal employees, it
could endanger the operations of the canal,'' said Michael Rhode,
the commission's secretary. ``We believe the canal should be kept
out of politics,'' he added in an interview.
   Rhode said the Panamanian directors had not participated in the
board's quarterly meetings since January 1988.
   This January, the Panamanians came to the meeting and read a
statement saying they would not take part as long as the United
States continues to recognize Eric Arturo Delvalle as their
country's president, Rhode said. Delvalle was ousted by Noriega in
February 1988.
   The absence of the Panamanians has not affected operations of
the board and the running of the waterway because the U.S.
directors are in the majority, Rhode said.
   But Gianelli feels the canal's administrator, Dennis McAuliffe,
and his senior staff cannot come to the Baltimore meeting ``at this
critical time,'' Rhode said.
   Noriega is under indictment in Florida on drug trafficking
charges and the United States has refused to recognize the
authority of his ally, President Manuel Solis Palma.
   As the Bush administration vowed to continue efforts to force
Noreiga to step down, the Panamanian government began to take steps
against the canal workers, such as denying them license plates for
their cars.
   The 1977 Panama Canal Treaties give the United States primary
responsibility for canal operation and defense until Dec. 31, 1999,
when Panama assumes responsibility and sovereignty over the
waterway.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Evidence Shows Great Lakes Fish Can Be Harmful</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is conclusive evidence that eating
chemically tainted Great Lakes fish can cause health problems in
humans, a researcher said Wednesday at a workshop assessing the
impact of pollutants on nature.
   At greatest risk are infants born to women who eat fish once a
week caught by non-commercial anglers, said Wayland Swain, former
director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Great Lakes
research laboratory in Grosse Ile, Mich.
   Citing several previous studies, Swain said such infants tended
to be born early with low birth weights, small head circumferences,
neuromuscular problems and impaired responses to visual stimuli.
   Researchers have found that toxic PCBs contained in the fish can
be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, said Swain,
vice president of the Eco Logic consulting company in Ann Arbor,
Mich.
   Although the research is not new, Swain said he is the first to
compile studies on the problem.
   He presented his report to the workshop organized by the
International Joint Commission, made up of representatives of the
United States and Canada. The panel acts as an advisory committee
to governments of both nations on issues relating to the Great
Lakes.
   Other researchers at the two-day workshop discussed health
problems in wildlife caused by PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls,
toxic chemicals used in electrical and industrial equipment but
banned in the United States since the early 1970s.
   Problems cited include reproductive difficulties and physical
deformities in birds, snapping turtles and otters that live in the
Great Lakes region.
   PCBs ``are generally very resistant to degradation,'' both in
the environment and in the human body, Swain said.
   Despite the national ban, they have remained in the environment
and are collecting at the bottom of all the Great Lakes, he said.
   ``There are a number of clean-up efforts proposed and some of
them have been started,'' he said.
   ``My impression is, given the effects we're seeing across the
animal species and in the human organism, we need to accelerate''
those efforts, Swain said.
   He said his report is based on studies that include a continuing
investigation by Wayne State University researchers in Detroit of
313 mothers and infants.
   The researchers are investigating whether the health problems
noted in infants of mothers who eat Great Lakes fish continue into
early childhood.
   Swain said a similar study of Taiwanese infants ``found effects
durable into early childhood.''
   Children of Taiwanese women who ate PCB-tainted rice oil ``did
less well on all scales of intelligence'' than children who were
not exposed to the chemical, he said.
   Swain said researchers need to determine which of 209 possible
PCB-related chemicals are the most toxic.
   ``Only a relatively few of them are the real culprits in
producing the toxicity problem,'' he said.
   Fish caught by sports fishermen are the most likely to be
affected, Swain said.
   ``Human consumption of fish sold commercially is generally
controlled and regulated through the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug
Administration) so we don't presumably come in contact with
contaminated fish,'' he said.
   Fish caught by anglers, of course, are not regulated.
   The workshop was organized to give participants _ about 100
scientists from Great Lakes states and provinces _ a chance to
compare research and to encourage more cooperation in identifying
environmental problems and their solutions, said commission
spokeswoman Sally Cole-Misch.

<HEAD>GAO Reiterates Questions About Bush Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has provided ``a reasonable
framework'' for rescuing the thrift industry, but his plan relies
on economic assumptions that may prove too optimistic, the General
Accounting Office reiterated Wednesday.
   Those rosy predictions, about such factors as interest rates,
the economic outlook and the growth of deposits, mean the plan's
costs ``are likely to be somewhat higher than those currently
forecast,'' the GAO said in a report that repeated the conclusions
its officials offered in congressional testimony earlier this month.
   The independent congressional agency also disagreed with the
administration's plan to finance the multibillion-dollar bailout
separate from the federal budget.
   Financing the rescue plan as part of the budget is desirable,
the GAO said, because that would allow financing at the cheapest
available rates. The agency said the off-budget strategy could add
$1 billion to the overall bailout cost during the next decade and
$4.5 billion over 30 years.
   The House and Senate banking committees are considering Bush's
plan, under which the administration proposes to shut down or merge
about 350 insolvent institutions and meet commitments from last
year's rescue of 205 others.
   Bush also proposed placing new capital requirements on thrifts,
and splitting up the responsibilities of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, which operates 12 regional banks.
   The administration has estimated the plan will cost $150 billion
to $200 billion through 1999, including financing costs. The
Congressional Budget Office, using the administration's own
economic assumptions, forecasts a $205 billion figure.
   Without coming up with its own price tag, GAO said it questioned
assumptions in the rescue plan that interest rates will fall
sharply from levels at the end of 1988. Higher-than-expected rates
could increase financing costs and hurt shaky institutions.
   The GAO also said a recession, which some economists believe is
likely in the next several years, could increase the number of
failing thrifts.
   And it said deposits may grow more slowly than the plan assumes,
cutting premium income. The plan could cost an extra $7 billion
over 10 years if deposits grow at only 3 percent a year instead of
the assumed 7 percent, according to Rep. Rep. Paul Kanjorski,
D-Pa., who requested the GAO study.

   The army Wednesday sealed off the occupied
lands for 24 hours and put the entire Gaza Strip under a curfew as
troops and police braced for violence on the annual ``Land Day''
protest by Arabs.
   Arabs on Thursday will mark Land Day, commemorating a
confrontation in their villages in Israel's Galilee on March 30,
1976, when six people were killed after the army and police opened
fire on demonstrators protesting government seizure of Arab land.
   This year's Land Day protest is drawing widespread concern in
Israel. Officials and newspaper editorials have warned of an effort
by leaders of the 15-month uprising in the occupied territories to
bring their protest into Israel itself.
   Ariel Sharon, Israel's right-wing trade minister, said Wednesday
that Israelis will not tolerate Arab violence within their country.
   ``Those radicals among the Israeli Arabs must understand it will
not be possible to push the Jews endlessly to the wall,'' he said.
   Last year, 30,000 Israeli Arabs marched on Land Day in support
of the Palestinian revolt. There were no major incidents inside
Israel, but four Palestinians were shot to death in clashes in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The underground Palestinian leaders have called for a general
strike Thursday, and leaflets distributed in Gaza urge Palestinians
to ``make the land anniversary an occasion to escalate the uprising
and burn the land under the Zionists.''
   The army sealed off the occupied lands for 24 hours beginning at
midnight Wednesday (5 p.m. EST), banning all Palestinian travel to
and from the West Bank and Gaza. The measure was to prevent Land
Day violence, a spokesman said.
   He said the entire Gaza Strip was placed under curfew as of 8
p.m. Wednesday (1 p.m. EST) that forced the Palestinian population
of 650,000 to stay indoors.
   ``When tension rises, we have no other choice but to respond
with wide-ranging curfews,'' army Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan
Shomron said. ``If necessary, the army will act very decisively.
   ``I hope the residents understand ... that to think we're just a
stone-throw away from a Palestinian state is only an illusion.''
   Thousands of extra troops were sent to the occupied lands. In
the West Bank town of Bethlehem, hundreds of soldiers were seen
taking up positions along main roads.
   Also in Bethlehem, a Palestinian died when an unidentified
object exploded inside his house, the army said. Arab reports
suggested the man, whose name was not given, might have been making
a bomb.
   In scattered stone-throwing clashes, three Palestinians were
wounded by army gunfire, Arab hospital officials said. At least 412
Arabs and 18 Israelis have been killed since the Palestinian
uprising began in December 1988.
   The army said reporters would only be allowed to travel to the
occupied lands Thursday accompanied by military officials.
   Inside Israel, leaders of the 810,000 Israeli Arabs also have
declared their own general strike.
   They say the main purpose is to protest unfair treatment, such
as inadequate municipal funding, but agree that Land Day protests
are also a show of support for the Palestinian rebellion.
   ``We are citizens of Israel and part of the Arab Palestinian
people. This is a form of support for their uprising,'' said
Mustafa Abu Rias, municipal council head in the Galilee village of
Sakhnin. ``We are acting under the symbol of support for the
uprising. Two states for two people!''
   Anticipating trouble, police forces have canceled all vacations
and launched a special operation to counter any Land Day problems
inside Israel.
   ``We have about 5,000 men, including 4,500 police and border
police and 500 soldiers,'' said Police Commissioner David Krauss.
``We will have sufficient forces to deal with every deviation and
disturbance.''
   Last week, members of new police ``Special Patrol Units'' and
100 high school students held a mock battle in the northern town of
Afula in preparation for Land Day. The students chanted slogans and
threw rocks and fake firebombs.
   Arab activists made preparations, too.
   Palestinian flags flew from mosque roofs and utility poles. New
pro-PLO slogans were scrawled on walls in several Galilee villages.
In Kafr Kanna, three vehicles were set ablaze, and police said they
suspect Arab nationalist motives were involved.
   Youths in Sakhnin, where three people died in the 1976 riots,
said they have prepared ``bottles and other things'' in case police
intervene in Land Day demonstrations.

   The disabled Exxon Valdez had complied with
all modern construction standards for oil tankers, but it tore open
in Alaskan waters because no design is immune to the consequences
of human error, a Coast Guard official said Wednesday.
   A spokesman said, however, that the Coast Guard plans no
disciplinary action against any of the tanker's officers unless the
results of an investigation by another federal agency of the oil
spill show it is warranted.
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
looking into the nation's worst oil spill said they were focusing
on actions of the ship's captain, Joseph Hazelwood. Exxon officials
said he had left the bridge to his third mate when the ship hit a
charted reef Friday and spilled 10.1 million gallons of oil into
Prince William Sound.
   ``It's a very new ship. I don't see any deficiencies at all,''
said Joseph Angelo, assistant chief of the Coast Guard's Merchant
Vessel Inspection and Documentation Division.
   The safety board is investigating because the Coast Guard, which
is responsible for tracking vessels in the sound, could be a
subject of the inquiry, said Coast Guard spokesman Capt. Randy
Peterson.
   Angelo said the 967-foot Exxon Valdez, built in 1986, meets all
the latest construction and equipment requirements, including the
installation of ballasts designed to protect against oil spills.
   ``The current standards that exist for the most modern tankers
are good,'' said Angelo. ``But no matter what you do, you can't
cover every possible aspect if human error is involved.''
   The Coast Guard supervises the design and construction of major
merchant marine vessels and conducts annual inspections of vessels
flying the U.S. flag, he said. It has authority over more than 500
major ships and thousands of smaller vessels.
   The Exxon Valdez, one of 72 oil tankers that have loaded crude
oil from Alaska's North Slope, was last given an inspection
certificate in November 1988, Angelo said. Its certificate expires
in 1990, with an interim inspection slated this November.
   The Exxon Valdez was constructed with a single bottom rather
than the double bottom used in some ships built in the late 1970s
when the government was considering requiring the added layer as a
protection against oil spills, he said.
   Instead, an international standard for oil tankers was adopted
which requires water-filled ballasts around portions of the ship
rather than the double bottom. The ballasts offer some protection
against oil spillage if a ship either hits bottom or is in a
collision.
   The Exxon ship has several ballasts, but the impact was too
severe for them to prevent damage. Exxon authorities have said the
tanker has five holes in its starboard side, the largest of which
is 6 by 20 feet.
   Coast Guard spokesman Peterson said officials would await the
results of the NTSB investigation before deciding whether
disciplinary action might be taken against Hazelwood or any other
officer of the Exxon Valdez. When it ran aground, the ship was
being operated by its third mate, Gregory Cousins, who records show
was not licensed in Prince William Sound.
   The Coast Guard, which licenses all maritime officers and issues
merchant marine documents to other members of ships' crews, has the
power to take away licenses for negligence, misconduct or
incompetence, said licensing official Frank Flyntz.
   Flyntz said Hazelwood, since his license allowed him to operate
the largest ships, was a highly qualified ship's master who had
passed extensive training and licensing procedures.
   Licenses for merchant ships' officers have to be renewed every
five years.
   Coast Guard records show that Hazelwood's license was issued for
the third five-year period in New York on Dec. 12, 1986, declaring
him ``master of ocean steam or motor vessels of any gross tons.''
He also was qualified as a radar navigator and was licensed for
Prince William Sound.
   Cousins, whom Flyntz described as ``a highly qualified
individual,'' was licensed last Jan. 12 in New Orleans as a second
mate, one degree higher than the post he had on the Exxon Valdez.
He also was qualified as a radar navigator, which would include the
ability to use radar to spot the shoreline and other ships but not
an underwater reef. He is not licensed for the sound.
   Pilotage licenses have arduous requirements, Flyntz said,
including the ability to take a blank piece of paper and map the
waterway with all navigational marks, shipping channels and depths
from memory.

   A Houston procurement firm has been fined
$13,500 for allegedly violating federal anti-boycott regulations by
agreeing to require a shipper not to move goods on vessels
blacklisted by the Arab League, the Commerce Department said
Wednesday.
   The fine was imposed on Daiichi Jitsugyo Inc., a U.S. subsidiary
of Daiichi Jitsugyo Ltd. of Toyko, whose Houston office purchases
oil and gas drilling equipment.
   Daiichi allegedly agreed to require a shipper moving equipment
to Oman to agree not to ship goods on vessels blacklisted by the
Arab League. It also allegedly failed to report that it received
boycott-related requests.
   Most Arab League countries boycott goods and services from
Israel and maintain lists of people and companies doing business
with Israel.
   Daiichi agreed to pay the civil penalty but did not admit or
deny guilty.
   In an earlier case, the firm in 1980 agreed to pay a $9,000
penalty for allegedly furnishing prohibited information and
violating the reporting requirements of the anti-boycott law.
   The Export Administration Act prohibits U.S. individuals and
companies from providing information about their business
relationships with boycotted countries and from refusing to do
business with others because of foreign boycotts.
   The anti-boycott provisions were adopted to keep U.S. firms from
participating in foreign boycotts which are not supported by the
United States or which are directed toward countries friendly to
the United States.

   The nation's first
private spaceship blasted off Wednesday for a 15-minute sub-orbital
flight that sponsors hope will usher in the age of the U.S.
commercial space industry.
   ``It's the first of many, and we think it's the real
breakthrough,'' said Bill Vance, whose company, Space Services
Inc., launched the Consort 1.
   ``I thought it was terrific,'' said Carol Lane, director of the
Transportation Department's division that licensed the Consort 1.
``It's a great beginning.''
   The rocket's payload of six scientific experiments underwent
near-weightlessness for a little more than seven minutes during the
flight.
   The rocket rose 178 miles and fell to earth about 58 miles north
of its launch pad at White Sands Missile Range.
   Houston-based Space Services, which employs 14 people, is the
same company that pioneered private space exploration by launching
the Conestoga 1 from Matagorda Island, Texas, with a dummy payload
in September 1982.
   The company dealt with 18 government agencies to get permission
to launch Consort 1. It even had to obtain an export license from
the State Department because the dummy payload landed in
international waters in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The Reagan administration, in an effort to open outer space to
private enterprise, directed the Transportation Department to
process and issue launch licenses and help cut red tape with other
federal agencies.
   ``It's been a six-year countdown. We've been in a long hold,''
said Vance, Space Services' vice president for finance and
adminstration. ``When we went up in '82, there was no
infrastructure for commercial launches to happen.''
   Space Services plans similar suborbital launches in the next
couple of years, and is applying for a license to be the first
private contractor to send a satellite into orbit.
   ``In fact, we see the sounding (suborbital) rocket business as
where we'll get a foothold in the industry and the orbital business
is where we'll make the big bucks,'' Space Services spokesman Mark
Daniels said.
   ``I think there's a big future for this,'' said Space Services
management analyst Jim Davidson.
   The Transportation Department's 22-employee commercial space
transportation department expects to process 10 launch licenses
this year, Lane said.
   Five companies are offering private launch services, and
Florida, Hawaii and Virginia are considering offering spaceports
for private companies, she said.
   Consort 1 cost $1 million to $2 million. The rocket consisted of
a modified Terrier Navy rocket booster, with a Black Brant sounding
rocket as a second stage. A 17-inch-wide, 11{-foot-long capsule
held the payload. The entire vehicle stood 52 feet tall and weighed
6,000 pounds at liftoff.
   Consort 1's payload consisted of experiments that normally are
carried aboard the space shuttle as ``Getaway Specials.'' But the
experiments didn't need to undergo days of near-weightlessness.
   The six experiments were assembled by the University of
Alabama-Huntsville's Consortium for Materials Development in Space,
one of 16 commercial development consortiums sponsored by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The payload included experiments designed to measure how liquids
mix in weightlessness, how plastic foam forms and cures, how
liquids coat glass surfaces, how epoxy reacts in weightlessness and
how finely powdered metals bond under high temperature to produce
alloys.
   The experiments have applications in medicine, the manufacture
of metal alloys and in construction of space stations.
   University spokesman Dave Dooling said a preliminary look at the
contents showed the flight was successful.
   ``The scientific team and the SSI team are both extremely happy
with the results,'' Dooling said. ``We think this is an outstanding
beginning, not only for space exploration, but for space
experimentation.''

<HEAD>Japan To Sign Contract Despite Uncertainty Over FSX Cooperation</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-FSX</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan said it will sign a contract by Friday with
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to develop its next-generation fighter
jet, but negotiations continue with the United States over
co-production, an official said.
   The Defense Agency official said on condition of anonymity that
the agency decided to sign a contract with Mitsubishi on Thursday
or Friday even if Tokyo and Washington do not reach a final
agreement on the FSX project by then.
   Takaaki Yamada, vice president of Mitsubishi's aircraft
division, called the decision ``a step forward in the FSX joint
development project.''
   A group of Japanese legislators meanwhile said on Wednesday that
Japan might want to build the FSX aircraft on its own.
   U.S. and Japanese officials have been meeting this week in
Washington to conclude an agreement on joint development of the
plane.
   Japan says agreement must be reached by Friday so money for it
can be included in Japan's budget for the fiscal year beginning
April 1.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday U.S.
officials are not sure if accord will be reached by then. He said
the delay is due directly to President Bush's insistence on
safeguards to protect U.S. technology.
   Bush said Tuesday he still wants to clarify the agreement.
Administration sources said the questions remaining involve who
will own technology resulting from the project and what percentage
of the fighter's development should be done in the United States.
   Persisting disagreement over the FSX agreement has generated
annoyance in Japan over U.S. objections to an accord originally
reached last year.
   On Wednesday, 43 legislators from the governing Liberal
Democratic Party presented a petition to the government urging it
to proceed with development of the fighter with or without U.S.
help.
   ``We have decided that joint development of the next fighter is
important for the security of our country ... (and) should go ahead
immediately under the agreement since it is crucial to our national
defense,'' the petition said.
   ``However, if there is a concern on the U.S. side, we should
scrap the agreement and develop the jet independently.''
   Under the FSX agreement signed late last year, St. Louis-based
General Dynamics would join Mitsubishi as a subcontractor in
developing the FSX as an advanced version of its F-16 fighter.
   Bush said last week he endorsed the pact for joint development
of the FSX fighter, which was concluded by the Reagan
administration, but wanted some changes to protect U.S. technology.
   Proponents say the agreement was the best deal the United States
could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to buying
U.S.-made F-16s.
   U.S. opponents of joint FSX development complained it amounts to
a giveaway of advanced aircraft technology that Japan could use to
compete with the United States in the world civilian aircraft
market.
   Japanese opponents argued that Tokyo should scrap the accord and
go ahead with its original plan to develop the jet on its own.
   ``Japan has the ability to develop the FSX independently,'' the
Defense Agency official quoted a member of Japan's Defense Security
Investigation Committee as saying Wednesday.
   ``We should cope with the U.S. objection by preparing a
blueprint for independent development'' of the fighter.

   President Bush on Wednesday announced his
selection of Michigan businessman Peter F. Secchia, a longtime
state Republican party leader, to be U.S. ambassador to Italy.
   Secchia, 51, who would replace Maxwell M. Rabb, is chairman of
the board of directors of the Universal Companies, Inc., a
privately held company with interests in forest products,
restaurants and real estate.
   Michigan's national GOP committeeman since 1980, Secchia was
co-chairman of Bush's 1988 Michigan campaign and he is a close
associate of former President Gerald R. Ford.
   The grandson of Italian immigrants, Secchia first visited Italy
as a U.S. Marine in 1956 and has been there several times since on
vacations and as a member of the Christopher Columbus Quincentenary
Jubliee Commission.
   He currently lives in East Grand Rapids, Mich.
   Bush also announced his intention to nominate Cameron Monjo as
U.S. ambassador to Indonesia. He would succeed Paul Dundes
Wolfowitz.
   Since 1987, Monjo has been U.S. ambassador to Malaysia and is a
former deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific affairs.
   Bush also announced that he would retain Henry Anatole Grunwald,
66, as U.S. ambassador to Austria, a post he has held since 1987.

<BYLINE>Utah Governor Calls Special Session On Fusion Funding, ^By MICHAEL
WHITE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Utah officials, excited by the prospect
that two scientists may have unlocked the secret of the sun with
basic chemistry, have pledged $5 million to expand the experiments
into nuclear fusion.
   And the resigning head of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration confirmed in Washington on Wednesday that he will
head up the project.
   University of Utah President Chase Peterson said the $5 million
will sustain the research while the university and state officials
negotiate with 200 private corporations that have indicated an
interest.
   The chairman of the university's chemistry department and a
British professor announced last week that they had done what has
stumped scientists for more than 30 years _ creating energy by
fusing atoms in glass flasks at room temperature. Scientists around
the world greeted the announcement with enthusiasm and skepticism,
including one who warned that if the so-called cold fusion had
occurred it could pose a serious radiation threat.
   The implications of such a discovery are enormous _ cheap, safe,
simple electrical power in an era dominated by petroleum-fueled
political tensions.
   Potential applications range from ``100 horsepower power plants
small enough for a car'' to 50-megawatt generating plants, said
James Brophy, university vice president for research.
   ``We know the science is true. We don't know about the
engineering and economics,'' he said.
   Gov. Norm Bangerter announced Tuesday that the Legislature will
convene April 7 to appropriate the funds. House and Senate leaders,
who had balked on the appropriation until the experiments were
confirmed, were sold on the idea after Peterson outlined the
process during a closed meeting earlier Tuesday and promised that
the agenda for the special session would be limited to fusion.
   Because the university has applied for patents on the fusion
process, lawmakers are hoping that the state will realize a
financial windfall by licensing private corporations to use the
technology.
   ``The numbers are staggering in terms of what this thing will
bring in if the patents hold,'' said House Speaker Nolan Karras.
   House Majority Leader H. Craig Moody said Wednesday he had no
doubt the Legislature would approve the funding. ``It's not a
matter of if it will happen, but when,'' he said.
   The cash will help the university lure ``five to 15 world
experts'' in fusion and engineering, Peterson said.
   James Fletcher, 69, the NASA chief who has already been
recruited, is a physicist who was the university's president from
1964-71.
   ``If they do'' verify the experiment, Fletcher said, ``it is
really something gangbusters. That would be the best thing that's
happened since I guess the atomic bomb _ and that was bad, but in
terms of breakthroughs it would certainly be a bigger factor than
the transistor when that was built.'' ``But the jury is still out.
We still have to verify it,'' he added.
   University officials said Edward Teller, recognized as the
father of the hydrogen bomb, may visit the campus sometime next
week.
   Fusion occurs in the sun and in hydrogen bombs.
   ``The real question is, how do we stay out in front of the world
on this. This identifies Utah as a center now'' for cold-fusion
research, Peterson said at the news conference.
   Electrochemists Stanley Pons of Utah and Martin Fleischmann of
the University of Southampton in England announced last Thursday
that they had sustained fusion for more than 100 hours in a flask.
   They said they generated four watts of electricity for every one
watt they used to power their device.
   Pons and Fleischmann's research will be published in May by the
Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry, and an article has been
submitted to the British science journal Nature, said university
spokeswoman Barbara Shelley.
   Peterson acknowledged the process could prove invalid or without
practical application. But he said he believed the research was
solid. He said several scientists, whom he did not identify, had
reviewed the Pons and Fleischmann article and were optimistic the
experiment did in fact produce fusion.
   John Soures, a University of Rochester fusion researcher, said
that if the Utah experiment actually produced energy, it also
emitted dangerous levels of neutron particles.

   The Supreme Court heard arguments Wednesday on
whether sculptor James Earl Reid of Baltimore was an employee or an
independent contractor when he created ``Third World America,''
depicting the plight of the homeless, for a Washington-based group.
   In 1985, with a handshake, the Community for Creative
Non-Violence, a homeless advocacy group, commissioned a sculpture
of a man, woman and infant huddled on a steam grate. The group
auctioned donated works of local artists to pay Reid $15,000 for
expenses and assistants. Reid donated his time.
   When the group planned to take the sculpture on a tour of
several cities to raise money for the homeless, Reid objected,
saying the work was too fragile. He urged the group to have the
work cast in bronze or make a master mold, but the group declined.
   Reid, who had the sculpture while making some repairs, refused
to return it, and registered it under his name.
   The Community for Creative Non-Violence filed suit claiming
exclusive copyright ownership. A federal judge ruled the sculpture
was ``a work made for hire'' and the group had the copyright.
   But a federal appeals court overturned that decision, saying the
group owned the work but must share the copyright and any profits
with Reid.
   Robert Alan Garrett, the organization's attorney, told the
Supreme Court that in an employment relationship the employer has a
right to control the product, and that Congress has recognized such
a relationship can exist without a written contract.
   Garrett said organizations have been relying on such laws in
their dealings with artists.
   Joshua Kaufman, Reid's attorney, argued that an agreement
doesn't constitute employment unless there's a written contract and
the employee receives all the benefits of employment.
   ``If employers don't provide benefits, they're not entitled to
fruits'' beyond the product, he said.
   ``This whole issue attacks the spirit of creativity,'' Reid said
after the arguments. Referring to the statue displayed nearby, Reid
said: ``The work that you see is mine _ my spirit, my vision, my
artistry.''
   Garrett, however, said the group provided Reid with the idea,
its specifications and the group's ``experience with the homeless.''
   The case is Community for Creative Non-Violence vs. James Earl
Reid, 88-293.

<TEXT>
   A group of senators Wednesday called on Health
and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to extend a program
that provides the drug AZT to AIDS victims who cannot afford the
costly treatment.
   The program is due to expire Friday.
   ``Without swift action by the administration, lifesaving
treatments will be abruptly terminated for thousands of people with
AIDS,'' said the letter signed by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and 11 others.
   Two weeks ago, the Senate turned back a Kennedy-sponsored bill
to extend the program when three Republican critics refused to let
the measure be acted on without debate or consideration of
amendments.
   Kennedy's bill would require the Department of Health and Human
Services to redirect $5 million in federal AIDS funds to the AZT
program for use through September.
   Currently nearly 7,000 AIDS victims are receiving AZT under the
program. The average cost of the drug treatment is $600 a month.
   Georgia and Kansas have already run out of federal funds
allocated to them under the program, and Idaho, Kentucky and Utah
are due to run out of money at the end of this month, according to
the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an AIDS advocacy group.
   Programs in other states, including Texas and California, which
account for about a third of all enrollees, will have spent all
their federal money by the end of June. Other states have enough to
hold them through the end of August, the AIDS group said.
   If the program expires, 2,875 people would be affected by the
end of June and 4,767 by the end of September, the AIDS group said.
   HHS has reprogrammed $10 million under the program since it was
renewed last September. However, the senators said the department
had been authorized to redirect $15 million, and they added: ``It
was the desire of Congress when this program was continued that the
Department of Health and Human Services fully fund the program
through the reprogramming of available AIDS funds.''

<HEAD>Psychologist: Schools Need To Help Kids Cope When Parents Split</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With divorce as common as it is, schools should
familiarize children with its painful reality, the new president of
an organization of school psychologists said Wednesday.
   Even if a child is not going through a divorce, he or she may
have friends who are and needs to know how to react to their
troubles, said Howard M. Knoff, associate professor of psychology
at the University of South Florida.
   Knoff, speaking at the annual convention of the National
Association of School Psychologists, said 40 percent of all current
marriages in the country will end in divorce and 40 percent to 50
percent of all children born in the past decade will at one time or
another live in a single-parent family.
   Knoff said the knowledge that a child is not alone in his or her
difficulties, and that parents are still available for support, is
essential to coping with divorce.
   Children commonly feel they are somehow to blame for the breakup.
   ``These reactions often involve depression, withdrawal,
grieving, fear and decreased academic and other school
performance,'' Knoff said.
   He recommended more counseling and teaching about divorce,
especially for children whose parents are splitting up.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Says Pay Raise Needed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said
Wednesday he's concerned about a ``very serious threat of erosion''
in the caliber of people seeking federal law enforcement jobs
because of low pay.
   ``I can't speak highly enough of those who are engaged in the
federal law enforcement effort in general today, but I'm extremely
concerned about the failure to keep abreast of the pay and benefit
needs of these employees,'' Thornburgh said during a luncheon
meeting with reporters.
   He said he was ``stunned'' that federal agents such as those who
work for the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration who were
considered ``the elite'' in the 1970s, have now reversed roles with
their state and local counterparts.
   ``That's not all bad,'' he said, because it means ``state and
local law enforcement agencies are attracting the type and caliber
of personnel that they need to do their job....
   ``But it does mean that there is a very serious threat of
erosion in the quality and quantity of the type of people that we
need in federal service,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``I've pledged to my people that I'll be a very outspoken
proponent of their needs,'' he said.
   Thornburgh said he was concerned not only for the FBI and DEA
agents, but also for U.S. Marshals, prison officials and law
enforcement personnel in other areas such as the Treasury
Department.
   In fact, the FBI and DEA fare reasonably well compared with such
Treasury Department agents as those in the Secret Service and the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   FBI agents start at just over $31,500 and can go as high as
$45,000 after about seven years, according to FBI spokesman Greg
Jones. The only people who earn more are in management, except for
those in New York. There, under a five-year congressionally
authorized demonstration project, agents earn 25 percent more than
their salary would be anywhere else because of the high cost of
living in New York, he said.
   At the DEA, non-management agents start at about $24,000 and can
reach in the upper $50,000 range, according to DEA spokesman Con
Dougherty.
   Secret Service Director John R. Simpson told a Senate panel
earlier this month that his service was offering $18,000 to
incoming agents, and recently had lost a three-year agent to the
Suffolk County police force in New York, where he'll earn $55,000 a
year.
   Meanwhile, Stephen E. Higgins, director of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, told the Senate hearing that starting salaries in his
bureau were $15,000 to $18,000.
   On other issues, Thornburgh said:
   _He is ``impatient'' to get his staff in place and has ``short
lists'' of candidates for virtually all the agencies his department
oversees, such as the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the
Marshals Service and others. ``The short list, in some cases,
includes the incumbent,'' he said, but he would not disclose for
which agencies or when announcements would be made on the
appointments.
   _He plans no more audits of any agencies such as those that
severely criticized the operations of the INS and the Marshals
Service because those audits were leaked to the news media. ``I'm
never going to run another audit again,'' he said.
   ``They're supposed to be management tools and not hammers to be
used to embarrass people,'' he said.
   _His two top aides, Robert Ross and Murray Dickman, have been
the main people involved in screening of possible judicial
candidates, and that function will remain in his personal office.
They are working with people from the White House counsel's office
in that effort, he said.
   Asked whether he would be concerned about a judicial candidate's
membership in restricted private clubs, Thornburgh said it was a
``political question and that's something that I think the
president and his staff are going to have to face with regard to
what the opinions are on the (Senate) Judiciary Committee.''

<HEAD>Moslem Leader, Aide Shot Dead At Brussels Mosque</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIPPE NEURAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Moslems in Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg and his aide were shot and killed
Wednesday, five weeks after the imam distanced himself from Iran's
death sentence for author Salman Rushdie.
   Imam Abdullah Al Ahdal, a 36-year-old Saudi Arabian and moderate
Moslem, and Salem El Behir, a 40-year-old Tunisian who headed the
Brussels mosque's social services and library, were shot at close
range in the imam's office in the mosque, police said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, and no arrests were
made. Police said there were no witnesses and that no one heard the
gunshots.
   The two men each were shot twice, once in the head and once in
the neck, police said. Unconfirmed reports said three hooded men
were seen jumping from a van, entering the mosque and then coming
out again.
   The bodies were found by members of the Islamic community early
Wednesday evening.
   On Feb. 14, Iranian revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issued a death sentence for Rushdie for ``The Satanic
Verses,'' a novel many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   In a Feb. 20 interview on RTBF, Belgium's French-language
television network, Ahdal agreed that Rushdie's book was
blasphemous.
   But he said of Khomeini's death sentence: ``One should not have
done that. Rushdie should have first appeared (before an Islamic
tribunal). He should have explained himself, defend himself. He
should have been asked to repent.''
   In democratic societies ``everyone has the right to speak his
thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' Ahdal said.
   Claude van Engeland, an RTBF reporter, said Wednesday the
network had received angry phone calls after the interview from
callers who claimed Ahdal, who spoke in Arabic, was improperly
translated.
   Ahdal's mosque, in a park near the European Economic Community
headquarters, is part of the London-based World Islamic League.
   After the killings, police cordoned off the building.
   At one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the
building and threatened a reporter with a handgun. Several police
officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her.
They said later she was Ahdal's widow.
   Rushdie, a Briton who was born in India to a Moslem family but
no longer practices religion, is in hiding in Britain. Moslems
object to ``The Satanic Verses'' because of a brothel scene in
which prostitutes take the names of the Prophet Mohammed's wives
and because it suggests Mohammed wrote the holy Koran instead of
receiving it from Allah.
   Members of the Islamic community told reporters outside the
building their mosque takes a very conciliatory tone.
   ``We respect everybody,'' one said on condition of anonymity.
``We do not take radical positions.''
   Ahdal had been in Brussels for six years heading the Moslem
community in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. His aide had
been here for about 10 years.
   Mohammed Sulim, a professor of Islamic religion, asked the
Moslem community to remain calm.
   He said, ``We are a few days from the Ramadan,'' which Moslems
mark with a month of fasting during the day.
   ``These are days for prayer. One must not seek revenge. The imam
was a tolerant man, a generous man, he lent his money to several
people.''

<HEAD>Planned Parenthood Criticizes USAir On Discounts for Anti-Abortionists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Planned Parenthood criticized USAir Wednesday
for giving discount fares to an anti-abortion group whose Los
Angeles convention ended in 700 arrests, but an airline spokesman
said politics is not the basis for discounts.
   ``It raises serious legal and moral questions when an airline
grants consumer discounts to an organization that is, by its own
admission, going to break the law by preventing people from
exercising their rights to reproductive health care,'' said David
Andrews, Planned Parenthood acting national president.
   Andrews said the discounts encourage the group, Operation
Rescue, in its efforts to ``disrupt the rights of American
citizens.'' Planned Parenthood advocates voluntary family planning
and says people have the right to choose whether to have children.
   The anti-abortion group blockaded a Los Angeles women's clinic
Saturday in defiance of a federal court order. Police in riot gear
arrested 725 Operation Rescue protesters, citing most for
trespassing. Most of those detained were released.
   The Los Angeles incident was the largest of several Operation
Rescue actions against abortion clinics in several cities.
   USAir spokeman David Shipley confirmed that Operation Rescue
members got discount fares for their Los Angeles convention but
said he did not know how much they were.
   He said the airline routinely offers discounts of 30 to 40
percent to any large group holding a meeting or convention,
including Planned Parenthood. The discount is based on the group's
size, the season and the market, and not on its beliefs, Shipley
said.
   ``We can't make judgments based on political, social or other
factors. We're an airline. We carry people,'' he said.

<HEAD>Retired Gen. Richard Ellis, Former SAC Commander, Dead at 69</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Gen. Richard H. Ellis, a former head
of the Strategic Air Command who also served as the Air Force's
vice chief of staff, has died of cancer. He was 69.
   Ellis, who died Tuesday at the Malcolm Grow Medical Center at
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., ``was a true military professional and
an accomplished diplomat who served his country with distinction in
time of war and peace,'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said Wednesday.
   ``As commander-in-chief of the SAC,'' said Nunn, chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee, ``Dick Ellis understood that our
nation's security is underpinned by a strong nuclear deterrent. As
ambassador in Geneva, heading our delegation to the U.S.-Soviet
Standing Consultative Commission, he understood the significant
contribution which arms control can make to our security.
   ``General Ellis was also a friend and a valued counselor. This
nation will miss him greatly.''
   Ellis, after retiring from the Air Force, was named in 1982 as
chief U.S. delegate to the U.S.-Soviet commission monitoring
compliance with arms control agreements.
   Ellis was a highly decorated command pilot, flying more than 200
combat missions as a bomber pilot in the western Pacific during
World War II.
   He was born in Laurel, Del. A 1941 graduate of Dickinson College
in Carlisle, Pa., Ellis joined the military in September 1941 as an
aviation cadet at Maxwell Field, Ala., and received his commission
and pilot wings in April 1942.
   During World War II, he was assigned to the 3rd Bombardment
Group in Australia, New Guinea and the Philippines.
   Ellis was released from active duty after the war and earned a
law degree from the Dickinson School of Law in 1949, practicing in
Wilmington, Del.
   He was recalled to active duty in October 1950 after the
outbreak of the Korean War, and spent the next 31 years with the
Air Force.
   At the time of his retirement in 1981, Ellis had served four
years as the commander-in-chief of the Strategic Air Command, the
organization responsible for America's land-based nuclear missile
and bomber forces.
   Prior to assuming that command, he worked as the
commander-in-chief of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and before that,
from November 1973 to August 1974, as the Air Force's vice chief of
staff, or No. 2 officer in the Pentagon headquarters' chain of
command.
   He earned his fourth star and the rank of full general on Sept.
30, 1973.
   Earlier in his career, Ellis had served as the head of the 315th
Air Division at Tachikawa Air Base in Japan, as well as at posts in
Turkey, Italy, Spain and England.
   A 1980 recipient of the Air Force Association's highest honor,
the H.H. Arnold Award, Ellis also had earned the Distinguished
Service Cross; the Distinguished Service Medal with three oak leaf
clusters; the Silver Star; the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf
clusters; the Distinguished Flying Cross; the Air Medal with four
oak leaf clusters, and the Purple Heart.
   The Air Force said Wednesday Ellis would be buried at Arlington
National Cemetery, but added the arrangements were still incomplete.
   He is survived by his wife, Margaret, of McLean, Va.; two sons,
and a daughter.

   A lawmaker from the governing Motherland
Party shot and killed an opposition deputy in the Parliament
building Wednesday, the city prosecutor said.
   A third lawmaker said he had argued with the gunman over this
week's elections and that the gunfire was intended for him.
   Prosecutor Akin Oncul said Deputy Idris Arikan was detained and
will appear at a hearing on Thursday. Arikan allegedly shot
Abdurrezzak Ceylan, who died while undergoing surgery on the chest
wound.
   The semi-official Anatolia News agency said a ballistic report
indicated the bullet was fired from Arikan's gun.
   But Arikan issued a statement saying that Ceylan, a member of
the True Path Party, was shot by another deputy, Zeki Celiker, an
independent.
   ``I drew my gun to protect myself. A ballistics report will
prove that the shot was not fired from my gun,'' Arikan said.
   Oncul said Celiker was interrogated after the incident but was
not detained.
   Celiker said he was questioned as a witness, and that the
gunfire was intended for him.
   ``Arikan drew the gun on me when we were arguing, Ceylan held
his arm, I walked away and then heard the shooting,'' Celiker said.
   Oncul said Arikan and Celiker handed over their guns for
ballistics tests.
   Two reporters, Kenan Harunoglu and Anatolia reporter Ismail
Bezgin said they heard the shooting.
   ``I saw Ceylan on the floor bleeding and Arikan walking around
with a gun in his hand and muttering to himself,'' Bezgin said.
   No one is allowed to enter Parliament armed, but Halim Aras,
deputy speaker of Parliament, said it is not always possible to
search deputies for arms.
   Arikan and Celiker were from the southeastern province of Siirt.
Ceylan, 37, also was from the province and had been a member of
Parliament since 1983.
   Anatolia said Arikan and Celiker argued over the results of
Sunday's local elections in which the Motherland Party suffered
defeats nationwide.
   The news agency said Arikan held Celiker responsible for his
party's defeat in Siirt, where the Social Democrat Populist Party
won the mayor's race in the provincial capital when rightists'
votes were split between Arikan's Motherland Party and Ceylan's
True Path Party.
   Celiker belonged to True Path before becoming an independent.
   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli ordered police to take
extraordinary security measures in Siirt to prevent clashes after
the slaying.
   ``This is a very ugly incident. I hope the reason is not
political. Not a bullet was fired under this roof in half a
century,'' said former Premier Suleyman Demirel, leader of the True
Path.
   Premier Turgut Ozal telephoned Demirel on Wednesday and
expressed his regrets over the killing.

   Canada announced Wednesday a review of the
investigation that concluded ice on the wings was the probable
cause of the 1985 Gander air crash that killed 256 Americans,
nearly all of them servicemen heading home for the holidays.
   Transport Minister Benoit Bouchard told a news conference that
confidence in the the Aviation Safety Board was ``jeopardized'' by
internal division over the three-year investigation into the
nation's worst air disaster.
   He said retired Supreme Court Judge Willard Estey will review
the investigation and present his report in 90 days.
   After disputes that often became public, the safety board issued
the report in December approved by five of its nine members
concluding that ice on the wings was the probable cause of the Dec.
12, 1985, disaster in Gander, Newfoundland.
   Four members issued a minority report that said an in-flight
fire or explosion was the most likely cause of the crash. Killed
were 248 U.S. soldiers heading home to Fort Campbell, Ky., from
Mideast peacekeeping duties and eight American crew on the Arrow
Air charter DC-8.
   The new review will look only at how the board's investigation
was conducted. It will not come to any conclusions about the crash
itself, stopping short of the full judicial review demanded by
critics of the investigation.
   The safety board was formed in 1984 so an independent agency
would investigate accidents rather than the Transport Ministry.
   Bouchard said the government still intends to create a new
agency to investigate all types of transportation accidents, as had
been speculated for some time.
   He also named a judge to handle the investigation of the March
10 crash of an Air Ontario Fokker F-28 jet at Dryden, Ontario,
although the safety board already had started its own work.
   The crash, whic killed 24, was the first fatal crash of a
regularly scheduled commercial flight in Canada in 10 years.
Justice Virgil Moshansky of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench was
named to investigate it.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After years of bitter debate, President Francois
Mitterrand on Wednesday reopened the Louvre as a gleaming,
high-tech museum capped by a controversial glass pyramid at the
main entrance to the medieval palace.
   Visitors poured in for their first look at the six-year, $850
million overhaul designed by American architect I.M. Pei and still
in progress. When renovations are finished in 1993, the
centuries-old building will be the world's largest museum.
   ``The interior of the pyramid is even more extraordinary than
the exterior. I think the modernism goes very well with the
classical style,'' said Franck Domingue, a Parisian who fought his
way inside the museum that is now known as the ``Grand Louvre.''
   ``It's light, it's beautiful, it's superb,'' said Martine
Bieri-Duminy, who lives nearby and watched the pyramid go up.
   ``In the beginning, people in the neighborhood were against it.
They thought the pyramid would spoil the architecture,'' she said.
But now that it is completed, ``it's good for the Louvre, it's good
for Paris, it's good for France,'' she said.
   Visitors who once lost their way in dark, dusty painting
galleries on their way to the ``Mona Lisa'' or ``Winged Victory''
are sure to appreciate the spacious and air-conditioned interiors
illuminated by skylights.
   The days of searching for the Louvre's entrance also are over.
It's hard to miss the 70-foot transparent pyramid rising gracefully
between the museum's two main wings in the center of the Napoleon
courtyard.
   Flanked by three smaller glass pyramids and night-lighted
fountains, the pyramid crowns a vast, underground lobby featuring
ticket windows, boutiques, an expanded bookstore and a 400-seat
auditorium with top-quality acoustics.
   From there, escalators branch out like the spokes of a wheel,
connecting the pyramid to other portions of the museum and reducing
the distance visitors once had to trek from one end of the U-shaped
Louvre to the other.
   ``The sense of orientation is the primary concern when
redesigning an encyclopedic museum,'' Pei said in an interview.
``The pyramid is the center of gravity, and one radiates from there
to the Italian, French and antiquities collections very easily.''
   The view from below is breathtaking. The baroque achitecture
added to the Louvre in the 19th century looms against the
ever-changing Paris skyscape.
   ``I used to pray for sun,'' Pei said. ``Afterward I realized
that the pyramid is even more transparent on a gray day when it
takes on the moodiness of the Paris sky.''
   The pyramid links visitors to the underground vestiges of the
first Louvre castle built by King Philippe Auguste in 1200 as a
military stronghold to protect Paris from English invaders.
   From specially built wooden walkways, visitors can stroll among
the restored ruins, including the base of the castle keep and
rounded turrets of the thick stone wall that once surrounded it.
   Remodeled as its royal habitants demanded more comfort and
luxury, these vestiges were unearthed during recent excavations
under the Cour Carre and are displayed under soft, yellow lighting.
   Also on display is a history of the Louvre itself, documented by
thousands of artifacts dug up in the Napoleon courtyard. They bring
to life the daily routines of Parisians over the centuries.
   Lovers of 15th century and 17th century French art will enjoy
airy high-ceilinged galleries on the third floor overlooking the
Cour Carre and the pyramid. The paintings have been cleaned,
reframed and hung at eye-level against gray walls illuminated by
skylights.
   ``This is a gigantic transformation,'' said Pierre Rosenberg,
the Louvre's head curator of paintings. ``The real issue is
creating rooms where one can both learn and enjoy.''
   One hundred paintings have been taken out of storage. On view
for the first time since 1963 are four mammoth murals by Charles Le
Brun titled ``L'Histoire d'Alexandre.''
   When the Grand Louvre is completed in 1993, it will house 4,000
items, nearly double what it displays today. With 650,000 square
feet of additional floor space, hundreds of paintings will have
been taken out of storage and shown publicly for the first time.
   Pei's pyramid _ in specially manufactured, slightly tinted glass
to be cleaned twice a month by Alpine climbers _ was the most
controversial aspect of the renovation project initiated by
Mitterrand.
   ``Five years ago, I had my doubts,'' Pei said. ``Not many people
would have bet on this project.''
   But Pei and Mitterrand held firm, and the tide turned in their
favor when a full-size cable model was erected on the spot.
   ``All through the centuries, the Louvre has undergone violent
changes,'' Pei said. ``The time had to be right. I was confident
because this is the right time.''

   Actress Doris Day was unable to present
the best original score Academy Award at Wednesday night's Oscar
show because she suffered a deep leg cut while walking in a garden
here, a spokeswoman said.
   Miss Day, who turns 65 on Monday, was scheduled to present the
award along with actor-dancer Patrick Swayze and composer Marvin
Hamlisch, but told Oscar show producer Allan Carr on Wednesday
morning that she would be unable to attend, said her publicist,
Linda Dozoretz.
   The actress, who received an Oscar nomination 30 years ago for
the romantic comedy ``Pillow Talk,'' was walking through the
gardens of the hotel she owns in this seaside northern California
community when she cut her leg on a sprinkler. The cut required
stitches, Dozoretz said.
   She said the actress was resting comfortably, but was upset that
she would miss the show. Ms. Dozoretz said clips from Miss Day's
films were expected to be part of a retrospective of the 1950s
segment of the Oscar show.
   During the Golden Globe Awards in January, Miss Day received the
Hollywood Foreign Press Association's honorary Cecil B. DeMille
Award for outstanding contributions to the entertainment industry.

   First Lady Barbara Bush is being treated for a
mild eye irritation that has been diagnosed as a thyroid disorder
known as Graves Disease, her office said Wednesday.
   ``Other than mild eye discomfort, Mrs. Bush has felt fine and
kept her usual active schedule,'' her press office said in a
statement.
   The statement said Mrs. Bush sought treatment after ``mild
swelling and irritation of the eyes and some loss of weight.''
   Mrs. Bush has been taking medication for four days, and has
``noticed marked improvement in her eye symptoms,'' the statement
said.
   Sondra Haley, a press aide to Mrs. Bush, said the condition,
which included swelling and watering in her eyes, was ``completely
under control.''
   ``It's not serious. It was more of an eye irritation,'' Ms.
Haley said.
   The statement said the disease is caused by the production of
excess amounts of hormones from the thyroid gland.
   It said the diagnosis was confirmed by blood tests last Friday
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center which showed ``slight elevations
of two thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothryonine.''
   Medical tests on the first lady included a thyroid scan and an
electrocardiograph, the statement said.
   Mrs. Bush is under the care of White House physicians and an
expert in tyroid disorders at Walter Reed, the statement said.
   She has been taking methimazole, a drug that blocks the
production of thyroid hormones, the statement said.
   Grave's disease is a disorder that causes the thyroid gland to
over produce the thyroid hormone. The specific cause of the disease
is not known, but it is thought to be related to a reaction of the
immune system. The symptoms can include an enlarged thyroid gland
(goiter), fatigue, heart arrythmias, insomnia, skin conditions and
fatigue. Some patients also develop swelling in tissues of the eye,
resulting in irritation, pain and light sensitivity.
   The disease can be controlled by a variety of drugs.

to subpoena for Reagan after 5th graf, ``Reagan's lawyer''</HEAD>

   A former Justice Department official testified
at Oliver North's trial Wednesday that in the early frantic search
for facts about the Iran-Contra affair, no one bothered to ask the
boss _ President Reagan _ about a possibly illegal 1985 arms
shipment to Iran.
   ``Did anybody think to ask this man whether he approved the
transfer of missiles?'' asked North's lawyer Brendan Sullivan,
pointing to an easel where he had written in 2-inch-high letters:
``PRES.''
   ``The questioning of the president was going to come after we
had questioned everybody else,'' said Charles Cooper, a former top
aide to then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   Sullivan's intense cross-examination of Cooper underscored the
defense's effort to have the former president appear in court to
testify for the former White House aide. North has subpoenaed
Reagan but U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell has not ruled
whether he will enforce the summons.
   Reagan's lawyer filed a paper with the court Wednesday insisting
that North's defenders say precisely why they want him as a witness
and what questions they will ask.
   The Justice Department filed court papers seeking to quash
North's subpoena for Reagan's appearance, suggesting written
interrogatories as an alternative.
   ``Unlike any other citizen, a President and a former President
both have a duty to protect the Presidency and to assure that
national security and international pece are not compromised
unnecessarily,'' said the department. ``Because ... it is he who
speaks for the nation, any hurried statement and any answer to a
surprise question pose a risk to the nation.''
   The department said the court ``should consider whether answers
to written interrogatories would provide'' North ``with all of the
essential facts necessary to a fair trial.''
   The issue of whether Reagan administration officials knew that
Hawk missiles were aboard a November 1985 flight to Iran was raised
at a Nov. 20 1986 White House meeting attended by Cooper, National
Security Adviser John Poindexter and his aide, North; CIA director
William Casey and CIA official Robert Gates, Cooper said. Meese was
there for part of the meeting.
   Cooper said the topic was testimony Casey was to give the next
day to the House Intelligence Committee. Cooper said North proposed
that Casey say no one in the U.S. government knew that the shipment
contained arms.
   Cooper said he learned after the meeting that Secretary of State
George P. Shultz remembered hearing about the Hawk shipment a year
earlier and telephoned Meese about the discrepancy.
   After Cooper did some follow-up work by talking to people at the
CIA, wasn't it time to ask Reagan about the November 1985 shipment,
Sullivan asked the witness.
   ``I don't know whether it was time to do so, but we did not do
so,'' Cooper said.
   Reagan was asked by the Tower commission what he remembered
about the shipment in which U.S.-made Hawks were flown from Israel
to Iran in an attempt to gain freedom for five American hostages
held in Lebanon.
   The commission, headed by former Republican Sen. John Tower of
Texas, quoted Reagan as saying he objected to the shipment and as a
result, the Hawks were returned to Israel. However, in another
meeting with the commission, Reagan said he could not remember any
meeting or conversation in general about Hawks and that he did not
recall anything about calling back the missiles.
   In the filing with the court Wednesday, Reagan attorney Theodore
B. Olson said he wants to know from North ``the specific evidence
sought by him from the former president'' _ and whether it is
information essential for his defense and not available from other
``less intrusive means.''
   Under an order issued by Gesell, North submitted to the judge a
sealed statement of what testimony he wants from Reagan. But, Olson
said in a filing with the court, he hasn't been allowed to see it
and therefore can't respond.
   Meese, one of the last prosecution witnesses, wound up his
testimony Wednesday, his second day on the stand. He was the 25th
prosecution witness in the trial, now in its ninth week.
   It was because of discrepancies over the 1985 shipment, Reagan
authorized Meese on Nov. 21, 1986 to conduct a fact-finding
inquiry, which led to the discovery in North's office the next day
that Iran arms sale money had been siphoned to help the Contras.
   Meese said he summoned North to his office on Nov. 23, a Sunday.
The former attorney general testified that after twice urging North
to tell the truth _ the national security aide withheld critical
details about the diversion.
   North is charged with falsely telling Meese that the National
Security Council had no involvement with the diversion and that
Israel, a conduit for the arms, actually determined the amount of
money funneled to the Contras. In fact, North and other U.S.
officials were directing the secret operation, investigators later
determined.
   Meese testified that North did not mention the involvement of
co-defendants Richard Secord or Albert Hakim in the affair. And he
acknowledged that North hadn't mentioned the role of Swiss-based
attorney Willard Zucker, who set up dummy companies for the
Iran-Contra operation.
   The ex-attorney general also said North hadn't mentioned how the
price of the arms sold to Iran had been marked up by 270 percent,
with some of the excess going to the Contras.
   Although the judge has not indicated whether he will direct
Reagan to comply with a subpoena issued by North's lawyers _ which
would be an unprecedented appearance for a former president _
Gesell has made a number of courtroom references to a possible
Reagan appearance. At one point, he said preparations should be
made in the event Reagan should appear.
   And while Meese was testifying, Gesell stopped a question about
Reagan's opinion, saying: ``You've asked to have the president
here. He's coming, he knows what his views were.''
   Whether that Reagan appearance would be in person or merely on
videotape is one of many issues concerning Reagan yet to be
resolved.
   Prosecutors already have the former president's answers to
written questions and Gesell ordered the attorneys Wednesday to say
whether they object to providing those to North.

   A judge Wednesday dismissed a murder charge
against a man accused of killing a policeman because members of the
city's elite anti-drug squad lied to get the search warrant for a
drug bust that ended in gunfire.
   State attorneys said they would appeal the Superior Court
judge's decision and try to have the murder charge against Albert
Lewin reinstated.
   Judge Charles M. Grabau told a packed courtroom that he had no
choice but to dimiss the case against Lewin, 33, who was accused of
shooting Detective Sherman Griffiths during the Feb. 17, 1988, raid.
   ``A fair trial is not possible,'' Grabau said. ``The
Commonwealth's conduct was egregious ... and the evidence is
tainted.''
   But Assistant District Attorney Paul Leary said his office would
continue battling for the case's reinstatement despite the
conflicting and fraudulent evidence submitted by prosecutors and
detailed in the judge's 30-page ruling.
   ``We say the lie doesn't reach the level of egregiousness the
judge believes it does,'' Leary said. ``It's in our interest to go
right to the Supreme Court.''
   Leary said authorities would seek Thursday to keep Lewin in jail
without bail while they pursued the case, which has raised
questions about whether police routinely lie to obtain search
warrants.
   Defense attorneys have said the case proves a pattern of police
abuse in obtaining search warrants and could result in new trials
for dozens of convicted drug dealers who were arrested after
possibly illegal searches.
   But Leary said his office set little store by the case's broader
implications.
   ``I'm fighting to have this case reinstated,'' Leary said. ``I'm
not too concerned about any other cases.''
   The slain detective's family condemned the judge's ruling,
charging him with making a ``gutless'' decision.
   ``We are devastated and outraged by the judge's ruling,'' said
the victim's brother, Tommy Griffiths.
   Griffiths, a 36-year-old member of the police department's elite
Drug Control Unit, was trying to break into an apartment in the
city's Dorchester section when Lewin allegedly fired a bullet
through the door and killed him.
   Officers had obtained a search warrant based on testimony by an
informant named John. Grabau dismissed the case last month after
detectives failed to produce John in court, saying they could not
find him. Further, Lewin did not match the search warrant's
description of the cocaine dealer police had sought.
   Last week, the detectives admitted lying about the existence of
John, who they said was actually a composite of two other
informants.
   The judge agreed to consider reinstating the murder charge
against Lewin after the detectives submitted affidavits clarifying
the informants' joint role in the arrest. On Wednesday Grabau said
a fair trial was not possible.
   The ``pattern of misconduct from the date of the tragic death
... to the present has been pervasive, egregious, deliberate and
intentional,'' he said.
   Assistant District Attorney Francis O'Meara has argued the
detectives lied to protect their sources from vengeful drug dealers
and to increase their chances of getting a search warrant.
   But Max Stern, Lewin's defense attorney, said the explanation
did not excuse the detectives' repeatedly fraudulent actions.
   ``It was not a lie. It was hundreds of lies,'' Stern said. ``And
in an effort to reinstate the case, it was just more lies.''
   Three detectives, Carlos A. Luna, 32, Hugo Amate, 31, and Paul
Schroeder, 33, have been suspended with pay while under
investigation by Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon for
perjury.

<HEAD>Extend Talks On Reforms And Legalizing Solidarity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition and the government will not
meet their Monday target date for concluding talks on political and
economic reforms and legalizing Solidarity, Lech Walesa said.
   Walesa, chairman of the banned independent union movement, and
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak decided after a 12-hour
meeting Wednesday that April 5 is the earliest possible date for a
final agreement in the 8-week-old round-table talks.
   ``It is going quite difficultly, but it is not hopeless,''
Walesa said early Thursday as he returned to Warsaw from the talks
in a government residence south of the capital.
   ``We are moving slowly toward the end, although there are some
hard subjects,'' he said. ``We agreed on 80 percent'' of the
problems.
   Kiszczak and Walesa could meet again early next week, Solidarity
advisers indicated.
   Walesa and about a dozen advisers looked discouraged as they got
off a small bus in front of the headquarters of the Roman Catholic
Church episcopate.
   An official statement on the meeting, issued by the state-run
PAP news agency, said Walesa and Kiszczak ``agreed that the working
teams will continue work so as to hold the final round-table
plenary conference on April 5.''
   The talks, which began Feb. 6, were scheduled to have their last
working-group sessions on Thursday, and the Communist Party Central
Committee was to meet Friday on ratifying the agreement.
   But the results of the meeting between Kiszczak and Walesa left
doubts on whether the agreement would be ready by then.
   Walesa and Kiszczak said earlier they wanted to sign the final
accord at a plenary session of the negotiators on April 3.
   Solidarity adviser Bronislaw Geremek said the opposition side
spent the Easter weekend studying written agreements reached so far
but that some problems remained in the areas of politics, the
economy and trade unions.
   The general outlines of the far-reaching agreement were reached
some time ago.
   In exchange for legalization of Solidarity _ outlawed after the
martial-law crackdown of 1981 _ and other opposition groups, the
opposition would agree to participate in Parliament elections in
June that would guarantee the Communist Party and its allies 65
percent of the 460 seats.
   A presidency and a Senate of about 100 members would be created.
The opposition would be expected to win the Senate, which would be
picked in a completely open, democratic popular vote.
   The Communist Party would be expected to get the presidency,
elected jointly by the Parliament and the Senate, owing to the
party's strength in the larger Parliament.
   In addition, the opposition would have access to the mass media,
including a daily newspaper and two weeklies and at least one
program on national TV and radio.
   In economic reforms, authorities would agree to a formula of
indexing workers' wages to compensate for Poland's unabating
inflation, more than 60 percent last year.
   Authorities agreed to the talks in August during the year's
second nationwide wave of crippling industrial strikes. Officials
have expressed hope that agreement with the opposition will provide
political and labor stability so that economic reforms have time to
work.
   They also hope that the accord will help persuade the West to
invest in Poland and help the country finance its $39 billion
foreign debt.
   Among the difficulties that remain in the talks are the
opposition's demand that all workers dismissed for
Solidarity-related activities in the past be rehired, the details
of the formula of wage indexation, and differences on the size and
the powers of the Senate and the powers of the new presidency.

   Federal authorities have smashed a
billion-dollar international operation laundering drug money and
forced Colombia's Medellin cartel to alter the way it handles drug
profits, the Justice Department said Wednesday.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, FBI Director William Sessions
and other top law enforcement officials said their ``Operation
Polar Cap'' has ended with charges against 127 people and two Latin
American banks. Most of the charges related to cocaine possession
and distribution and money laund ering.
   But Justice officials said one of the defendants, Eduardo
Martinez, eluded capture in Panama by the Panamanian Defense Forces
after he holed up in a bank there Wednesday. U.S. authorities had
relied on the defense forces for assistance, despite the fact it is
headed by Panamianian Gen. Manuel Noriega, who is himself under a
federal indictment for drug trafficking.
   Charles Saphos, chief of the Justice Department's narcotics and
dangerous drug section, said the Panamanian Defense Forces had
detained Martinez's private plane that he had flown to Panama City
as well as his pilots are are ``hoping he'll come back'' so they
can arrest him.
   Thornburgh called the investigation ``the largest
money-laundering crackdown ever carried out by the federal
government.''
   Agents seized a half ton of cocaine and $45 million in cash,
jewels and real estate, and filed civil actions in an effort to
seize as much as $412 million more in assets of the banks, Banco de
Occidente of Panama and Banco de Occidente of Colombia, that are
deposited in U.S. bank accounts.
   The operation, reaching across the United States into South
America and to England, had direct ties to the Medellin drug cartel
of Colombia and laundered $1.2 billion over two years, Justice
Department officials said.
   The cartel is responsible for as much as 80 percent of the
cocaine flowing into the United States, according to federal drug
officials.
   ``There is no more effective way to deal with the business of
drug traffickig than to take the profit out of it. That's what has
happened with Operation Polar Cap,'' Thornburgh said at a news
conference.
   ``I think it's fair to describe this operation as a very hostile
takeover of a major money laundering operation,'' he said.
   U.S. officials said the laundering operation played a
significant role in the handling of the cartel's illegal drug
proceeds and was known within the drug world as ``La Mina,'' or
``The Mine.''
   Agents learned of the ring while operating an undercover
money-laundering operation of their own in Atlanta as part of a
joint investigation by federal agencies, including the Internal
Revenue Service and Drug Enforcement Agency.
   Authorities said that undercover agents received complaints from
alleged drug-world figures that they were moving too slowly in
their laundering, or processing the money into seemingly legitimate
accounts.
   The agents were told La Mina could get the money by wire from
Los Angeles to Panama within 48 hours, according to court documents
released with the indictments.
   Federal agents then expanded their investigation into that
operation, using electronic intercepts, surveillance and pursuit of
financial paper trails.
   Thornburgh said that while it is difficult to determine how much
impact the federal action will have on the Medellin cartel,
``common sense tells me when you disrupt an operation that has
laundered over a billion dollars in two years, you're going to
force some adjustment in their operation.''
   DEA administrator John Lawn said that one indication of the
effect was seen immediately by drug agents. When La Mina was forced
out of business, he said, ``the phone was ringing off the hook'' at
the undercover money-laundering operation that was continuing in
Atlanta, with requests for use of their services.
   The Atlanta agents were so busy they laundered $4 million in
three days, he said.
   ``If there were other facilities within the United States for
the laundering of money, they would not have come back to a minor
money-laundering operation that was causing them trouble with
getting their money moved quickly,'' Lawn said.
   Arrests began in Los Angeles in February, where federal agents
charged that large amounts of money was being laundered through
jewelry dealers who allegedly used phony gold shipments to cover
the transactions.
   Thornburgh told reporters during a luncheon meeting in his
private dining room that Martinez, of Medellin, Colombia, was holed
up in a bank in Panama that was surrounded by Panamanian Defense
Forces. He had been scheduled to meet with undercover agents in
Panama on Wednesday.
   However, later in the afternoon Martinez somehow managed to
escape from the bank, said Bruce Pagel, a trial attorney with the
Justice Department's narcotics section.
   ``I don't know what the logistics were,'' Pagel said. ``The last
information I had was he was not in custody and ... they are not
expecting to take him into custody at the moment.''
   Lawn said the Panamanian forces had continued to cooperate with
DEA despite Noriega's indictment.
   ``Obviously, they are circumspect in dealing with them,''
Thornburgh said of DEA. ``These are not naive individuals. On the
other hand, they're faced with the necessity of having to deal with
law enforcement in Central and South America, and I assume they're
doing the best they can.''
   Martinez is described in the indictment as an associate and
agent of Geraldo Moncada, whom the government accused of
organizing, supervising and managing for the Medellin cartel the
importation, sale and distribution of cocaine in the United States,
and in particular, in New York.
   The Justice Department said that among the indictments resulting
from the investigation were charges against 29 people unsealed in
Atlanta and eight people arrested Tuesday evening in New York.
   Federal agents were seizing accounts at banks in Atlanta, Miami,
New York and the San Francisco-San Jose area, the department said.
   An indictment charges that the general manager of Banco de
Occidente of Panama, William Guarin, and other bank officers
authorized the use of the bank to accept wire transfers on behalf
of the cartel. Thornburgh said there was no evidence of illegal
activity by U.S. banks, and that the banks cooperated in the
investigation.

<HEAD>Police Search For Missing Man With $33 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police issued an international alert
for an executive who vanished with $33 million in cash and left the
country's largest search and rescue operation near collapse,
authorities said Wednesday.
   John Friedrich, head of the non-profit National Safety Council,
made headlines nationwide when he disappeared late last week.
   Australian media said he apparently had no passport, was not
listed on voter rolls and did not have a social security number.
   Police said they were not sure if Friedrich was the man's real
name. His wife, Shirley, pleaded on national television for her
husband to ``come home and clear up this mess.''
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke on Wednesday said there was no evidence
Friedrich, 44, had any links with overseas intelligence services,
as suggested in news reports.
   ``There have been so many fanciful claims made, including that
this missing person is a CIA agent,'' Hawke said. ``I've had all
these things checked out, and I'm assured there is no substance in
these things.''
   Federal police said Interpol, the Paris-based international
police network, was on the alert for Friedrich after he was
reported seen in Auckland, New Zealand, and in West Germany.
   ``We've got no solid evidence as to whether he's alive or dead,
or if he's in Australia or has fled the country,'' a police
spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity. ``He just vanished.''
   The National Safety Council was founded in 1927 and is based in
the state of Victoria. Aside from the military, it is the country's
largest search and rescue organization with 29 airplanes and
helicopters.
   But the council has debts of $180 million, and the government
has refused to bail it out.
   Police said the organization's debts were not the result of
criminal activity by the council.
   Newspapers said Friedrich duped banks in Australia and overseas
into providing loans based on false invoices for equipment that was
supposed to serve as collateral.
   The reports detailed how Friedrich engineered the phenomenal
growth of the council, transforming it from a one-aircraft
operation into an organization with 450 employees.
   Questions were raised as far back as 1975 about the search and
rescue operation's finances, according to reports.
   Aides said Friedrich always sent a deputy to board meetings in
his place and arranged for couriers to deliver financial documents
at the last minute so they would be signed without much study.
   Board president Max Eise said in an interview with the Sydney
Morning Herald newspaper that Friedrich once lied about where he
was born and then said, ``I'm a non-person.''
   Some politicians have called for a Royal Commission of Inquiry,
the highest form of investigation, into Friedrich's activities
following police reports that he might be an illegal immigrant.
   A police spokesman who spoke on condition of anonymity said an
investigation was hampered by conflicting dates on Friedrich's
credentials, including his marriage certificate.
   Friedrich received the Order of Australia, the country's highest
award, last year. A spokesman for Governor General Bill Hayden said
Wednesday he could be stripped of the honor if it is found he is
not an Australian citizen.

   State Treasurer A. James Manchin, one
of West Virginia's most popular political figures, was impeached
Wednesday for losing $279 million in state funds through bad
investments.
   The state House of Delegates voted 65-34 to approve 17 articles
of impeachment against Manchin, whom Delegate Stephen Bird called
``the most popular man in West Virginia.''
   The vote sends the case to the state Senate. Senate President
Larry Tucker said a three- four-week trial on the treasurer's
removal probably will be held in late May.
   Earlier, the House voted 39-60 against a move to censure and
publicly reprimand the 61-year-old Democrat, a lesser rebuke
favored by Manchin's supporters.
   The House did approve the censure of state Auditor Glen Gainer
for his role in the losses, the bulk of which occurred from April
to June of 1987. Manchin and Gainer serve with the governor on the
Board of Investments, which supervises investments managed by the
treasurer's office.
   ``When you consider the leadership of the House ... that's
behind all of this, and how they've been twisting arms and pushing,
I'm not surprised at the outcome of this vote,'' Manchin said. ``I
have committed no wrong. I'm going to stay around as long as I
can.''
   One of Manchin's supporters, Delegate Pat Bradley, referring to
Manchin's popularity, said voters ``know he's not a financial
genius. What they do know is he is a leader.''
   Bradley said Manchin would fight the attempt to oust him.
   Manchin testified during 10 days of hearings before the House
Judiciary Committee that he knew little about investments. He said
he was betrayed by subordinates he hired to run the consolidated
investment fund that lost the $279 million.
   The committee approved the articles of impeachment Monday.
   Delegate Marc Harman, a Republican who headed the impeachment
move, said the evidence against Manchin met the state
constitutional standard of impeachment for ``maladministration,
incompetency, neglect of duty, and high crimes and misdemeanors.''
   The articles specifically charge Manchin with failing to
supervise the fund, delegating his power and authority, making
improper investments, paying out funds that were not earned, and
covering up the losses.
   ``Delegation does not mean abdication,'' Harman argued. ``You
simply cannot delegate to the point where you have no
responsibility.''
   If convicted by the Senate, Manchin would be removed from office
and would be ineligible to run again. A conviction also would
likely lead to the loss of his pension, estimated to be at least
$2,128 a month.
   The last time a West Virginia treasurer was impeached and
removed from office was in 1876.
   
   Manchin, who has spent 40 years in state government, was first
elected state treasurer in 1984 and was re-elected last fall.

<HEAD>Alaskan Oil Tragedy Revives Bitter Memories Of Santa Barbara Spill</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Tanker Spill, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The oil that is defiling Alaskan waters has
revived painful memories for those who saw the California coast
blackened by greasy sludge 20 years ago in a calamity that helped
spawn the environmental movement.
   ``It's the same thing all over again, only on an even larger
scale,'' said lawyer-environmentalist Robert Hopps, who was a high
school senior when the Santa Barbara oil spill occurred on Jan. 28,
1969.
   ``The message is you cannot trust the oil companies. You cannot
believe their representations regarding the safety of oil
operations,'' Hopps said Wednesday by phone from Santa Barbara,
where he recently ended his term as president of Get Oil Out, or
GOO, which was formed after the spill.
   About 10.1 million gallons of oil have flowed into Alaska's
once-pristine Prince William Sound in the nation's worst oil spill,
which happened when the supertanker Exxon Valdez ran onto a reef
Friday.
   The Santa Barbara spill occurred because of the blowout of an
improperly cased well on an offshore drilling platform operated by
Union Oil Co. of California.
   The California Coastal Commission, marking the 20th anniversary
of the spill, recalled that it ``spewed more than 3.25 million
gallons of oil over 800 square miles of water, covered 100 miles of
coastline and beaches with a thick tarry black goo, smothered
thousands of birds, fish and other sea life, and helped trigger a
new age of environmental awareness.''
   A spokesman for Union _ now Unocal Corp. _ has disputed those
statistics, contending that only 30 miles of coastline were
affected by a spill of no more than 840,000 gallons. However, the
Western States Petroleum Association has said at least 2.1 million
gallons spilled.
   Unocal, which paid about $16 million in settlements as a result
of spill-related lawsuits, also disputes claims that oil still
leaks from the spill site. It says the leakage is the result of
natural oil seepage from the sea floor.
   Unocal and other oil companies still drill for oil off Santa
Barbara. In 1969, there were 10 oil platforms in Santa Barbara
Channel; at the beginning of this year there were 22, with
applications pending for six more.
   The petroleum association said the environment has recovered
from the Santa Barbara accident, which spurred the oil industry to
institute safer technology and tougher controls for oil drilling
and production.
   Michael Neushul, a biology professor at the University of
California at Santa Barbara, agreed that, based on limited studies,
the spill ``wasn't an ecological disaster.'' He said that the Santa
Barbara Channel appears to have recovered from the deaths of at
least 9,000 birds, 8.8 million barnacles, 30,000 mussels and 51,800
limpets.
   However, Hopps, commenting earlier this year on the 20th
anniversary of the spill, sharply disagreed. ``If that was not an
ecological disaster, there is no such thing as an ecological
disaster,'' he said.
   Neushul said studies in Santa Barbara have not proved that the
fishing industry there was harmed. However, he said the result may
be different in Alaska, where salmon spawning areas could be badly
damaged.
   The Alaskan accident will bolster environmentalists because it
highlights ``the now-familiar ineptitude of the oil companies and
government agencies responsible for environmental protection,''
Neushul said.
   The latest spill made him think, ``God, how can these (Exxon)
people be so stupid?'' Neushul said. ``The key to oil spills is
don't spill it in the first place.''
   Hopps said memories of the 1969 accident ``are almost constantly
there _ like a nightmare one expects to live with the rest of their
life.''
   ``I saw hundreds of birds covered with oil head to toe, some
already dead, others dying. ... I remember beaches inches thick
with oil. And I remember for years afterward swimming in the ocean
and getting tar and oil on my body.''
   Lois Sidenberg, a GOO co-founder who now is the group's vice
president, said when she learned of the Alaskan oil spill, ``the
first thing I thought of was getting a Scotch Old Fashioned.''
   She remembered that in 1969, ``when you went down to the shore
and looked, all you could do was cry. It was such a devastation of
a beautiful area.''
   Alaskans should ``get on the president and tell him not to
permit any expansion of oil development,'' Sidenberg said.
   Asked what he would say to Alaskans about their spill, Hopps
replied: ``It's like asking somebody who's lost a loved one what
you want to share with somebody under similar circumstances. They
have my sympathy and my understanding, but the deed is done.''

   Investigators used gardening tools and
metal detectors Wednesday to search woods where the bodies of seven
women have been found since last summer.
   Police and a search dog discovered the seventh body Tuesday in
Freetown, and District Attorney Ronald A. Pina said it certainly
was related to the other corpses uncovered in the area, which is
centered around a highway intersection.
   Superior Court Judge Courtland A. Mathers granted on Tuesday
Pina's request to extend a grand jury investigation into the deaths
of the women.
   The first six, whose skeletal remains were found between July
and December last year, had been involved in prostitution or drugs
in New Bedford's Weld Square area, according to family members and
police.
   Investigators identified the seventh body Wednesday as Robin
Rhodes, 29, who had been missing from the New Bedford area for
about a year.
   Pina said Rhodes had a history of heroin addiction, but no
record for prostitution.
   A forensic expert said the six women died between October 1987
and April 1988. Three more New Bedford women have been missing for
more than a year.
   A police dog searched the area where the last body was found
last fall, but was distracted by the scents from several reporters
and cameramen in the area and the search was called off, police
said.
   Police resumed searching with dogs on Monday because the weather
was warmer and state police believed the area merited further
examination.
   ``Information from our investigation indicated that we needed to
be out and searching those areas again,'' Pina spokesman Jim Martin
said.
   Police Detective Gardner Greany said investigators were
searching for items the killer, or killers, may have stepped on and
pushed into the ground.
   ``The killer could have stepped on a piece of metal, a key or
something ... and it might be helpful,'' Greany said.
   Pina obtained a subpoena forcing Kenneth C. Ponte, a lawyer who
investigators say knew at least three victims, to appear before the
grand jury earlier this month.
   Police have charged a New Bedford man with three roadside sexual
assaults that allegedly occurred in the area of the slayings. The
man, Neil Anderson, is free on $15,000 cash bail pending trial.
   Police will not say whether either Anderson or Ponte is
suspected in the slayings. Martin said investigators were ``not in
a position to request an indictment'' at this time.

   The Department of Transport said Wednesday night
it asked for a report into how a substance used to train dogs to
sniff out explosives was left on a British Airways jetliner for
weeks after an anti-terrorist training exercise.
   Independent Television News, which broke the story, identified
the substance as several pounds of explosives and said the Boeing
747 was believed to have made several journeys with passengers on
board before it was found.
   But Inspector Andrew Nielsen of Surrey county police said the
``dog training aid'' left on the plane after the exercise at
London's Heathrow airport was incapable of exploding.
   ``At the very worst it could flare up if ignited by fire. Nobody
at any time has been placed in any danger,'' he said.
   British Airways press officer Derek Ross said cleaners found the
substance under a seat at the rear of the plane.

   Three men were convicted Wednesday in the
exeuction-style murder of a rookie policeman whose death became an
issue in last year's presidential campaign and helped set the
national agenda in the war on drugs.
   Scott Cobb, 25, was convicted of second-degree murder and
weapons charges for his role in the death of Officer Edward Byrne,
who was shot five times while he sat in his patrol car guarding the
home of a witness in a drug case.
   About two hours later, a second jury convicted Todd Scott, 20,
and Philip Copeland, 23 of the same charges. Two juries were
required because Scott and Cobb implicated one another in
videotaped statements made after their arrests.
   The verdicts from both juries were met by cheers and applause in
the courtroom from police officers and friends and family of the
slain officer.
   Byrne's shooting became an issue in the presidential election
when his father, Matthew Byrne, presented then-Vice President
George Bush with his son's police shield.
   Bush, who said it was the most emotional moment of the campaign
for him, showed the shield to audiences around the country when he
spoke about the need to crack down on illegal drugs.
   Cobb shook his head listlessly as he listened to the jury
announce its verdict after two days of deliberations in state court.
   Scott and Copeland, who grinned as his verdict was read, both
told reporters, ``I'll be back,'' as they were escorted from the
courtroom.
   Queens District Attorney John J. Santucci hugged and
congratulated Matthew Byrne, a former police officer who is now a
lawyer.
   The defendants each face a maximum sentence of 25 years to life
on the murder charges and five to 15 years on second-degree
criminal possession of a weapon.
   Judge Thomas Demakos set sentencing for Cobb on April 24 and for
Copeland and Scott on April 25.
   Cobb's attorney, Michael Fishman, said he would file an appeal
after sentencing.
   Prosecutors charged that the three defendants, along with
another man, David McClary, executed Byrne on directions issued
from Rikers Island by jailed drug lord Howard ``Pappy'' Mason.
   Byrne, 22, was shot at point-blank range as he sat alone in a
parked police car in a drug-riddled Queens neighborhood early the
morning of Feb. 26, 1988.
   Prosecutors said Mason ordered the slaying in retaliation for
his conviction and imprisonment on a weapons charge earlier the
same week.
   ``It was a declaration of war against our society and a message:
`Oppose us and die,''' Assistant District Attorney A. Kirke Bartley
said in his closing argument Monday.
   The trial began on what would have been Byrne's 23rd birthday.
   Byrne was guarding the home of Arjune, a drug-case witness who
lived in the crack-ravaged neighborhood. Police assigned 24-hour
protection to the Guyanese immigrant's home after drug dealers
firebombed it in an effort to intimidate him.
   Arjune, who is now in the federal witness protection program,
testified that he saw Scott and Cobb from his bedroom window just
minutes after hearing five gunshots on the street below.
   Other prosecution witnesses detailed a meeting in a Queens
kitchen where the killing was planned, while a former drug
addict-prostitute, Rachel Moore, placed all three defendants in the
area of Byrne's car when he was killed.
   Cobb and Scott both took the witness stand in their own defense.
Each admitted they were there when Byrne was killed but denied any
involvement in its planning or execution.
   The fourth defendant, McClary, 22, will be tried later. Scott,
an admitted drug dealer, identified him as Byrne's killer during
testimony.
   In the wake of Byrne's slaying, police established the Tactical
Narcotics Team, or TNT, which established a heavy police presence
in the area. TNT has since been extended to other drug-riddled
neighborhoods.

   Ten thousand riot police firing tear
gas stormed the Hyundai shipyard before dawn Thursday and battled
striking workers who had been occupying parts of the sprawling
facility for three months, police said.
   Police fired hundreds of tear gas shells before charging the
yard at Ulsan on the coast about 150 miles southeast of Seoul,
according to Yonhap, the national news agency.
   Riot police in green combat fatigues and visored helmets knocked
down barricades erected by the strikers at the country's biggest
shipyard, it said.
   About 1,000 of the attacking police used boats to get into the
shipyard from the sea.
   Police officials said about 200 strikers were arrested and 700
more strikers were surrounded by riot troopers in a company
dormitory. At least one police officer was injured, the officials
said.
   ``Why are police using force to stop our right to strike? We
have been trying to talk to management, but there has been no
response,'' one of the strikers said in a TV interview aired on the
Korean Broadcasting System.
   The government ordered police to end the strike by militant
workers who had repeatedly stalled operations at the shipyard.
Senior government ministers in a meeting in Seoul on Wednesday
ordered police to occupy the shipyard.
   About 1,000 militant members of an independent labor union had
been staging protests at the yard, which employs about 22,000
workers. Strikers are demanding higher pay and recognition of their
union.
   The government intervened after repeated requests from Hyundai.
   Authorities deployed 14,000 riot police around the shipyard and
started to move in after midnight. Some strikers left the shipyard
as police began blocking the main gates.
   Hundreds of strikers wearing construction helmets and armed with
iron bars held off police for about five hours by threatening to
ignite a pile of 60 propane gas containers. Some strikers were
armed with homemade flame throwers made from welding kits, but
police said they were not used.
   Strikers set fire to two of the propane gas tanks when police
attacked, but troopers put out the fire with a fire engine and
there was no explosion, police said.
   President Roh Tae-woo's government has warned it will deal
severely with militant workers who have staged a series of often
violent strikes.
   The government had urged companies to settle labor disputes
peacefully without official interference. But government officials
now fear the strikes will damage the national economy.
   Hyundai has refused to recognize the militant union, and clashes
broke out previously at the Ulsan yard between strikers and
pro-management workers. The company said the protests were costing
up to $6 million a day in lost business.
   Korean news reports said most workers at the shipyard wanted to
work.

<TEXT>
   The United States is willing to help
the leftist Nicaraguan government if its members hold free
elections 1990 and still retain power, U.S. Ambassador Deane Hinton
said Wednesday.
   ``We are willing to help them economically,'' Hinton said at a
news conference. ``The new administration of President Bush is
ready to give more carrots instead of sticks.''
   Hinton's comments seemed to go much further than any the Bush
administration has made so far on Central American policy.
   The administration, in its public statements, has not been
specific about rewards it would offer Nicaragua's Sandinista
government if it lives up to its promises of democratization.
   Privately, however, the State Department holds out the prospect
of economic aid and normal relations if the country meets its
commitment, including holding free and fair elections next February.
   Despite his comments, Hinton said the Nicaraguan government
remains the major obstacle to peace in Central America ``because
the Sandinistas keep supplying weapons to the Salvadoran rebels.''
   Hinton also said the aid package Bush has proposed for the
rebels opposed to the Nicaraguan government would not endanger the
peace accords signed by the five Central American presidents on
Feb. 14.
   Bush on Friday announced a bipartisan accord that would allot
$45 million in non-military to the rebels, known as the Contras.
   Congress still must approve the aid, which would end next
February.
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega has said the proposal
violates the Central American peace accords.
   Ortega and the presidents of Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica
and Guatemala have agreed to come up with a plan by mid-May to
disband the Contra force, now living in Honduran border camps.
   An estimated 11,000 Contra fighters and their family members
have lived in the camps since the U.S. government cut off military
aid in February 1988.
   Nicarguan Embassy sources in San Jose, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Nicarguan
Foreign Minister Miguel Descoto will denounce the Contra aid
proposal when he meets with fellow Central American foreign
ministers in San Jose on Thursday and Friday.
   The foreign ministers are to discuss progress made since the
Feb. 14 accords and the Contra aid proposal.
   Guatemalan Foreign Minister Mario Palencia arrived in San Jose
on Wednesday and told the AP he did not believe U.S. aid would hurt
the accords.
   ``We are sure the U.S. government is working in good faith to
support a peaceful solution to the Central American crisis,'' he
said in an airport interview. ``The new humanitarian aid for the
Nicaraguan Resistance is not an intervention.''

<HEAD>Actor Bernard Blier Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bernard Blier, one of the most enduring and
versatile actors in French cinema, died Wednesday night at the age
of 73, his son, film director Bertrand Blier, announced.
   He said his father died in the Paris suburb of St. Cloud after a
long illness.
   On March 4, Blier received a Cesar award, the French equivalent
of an Oscar, honoring the body of his work _ about 150 films in a
career that spanned more than half a century. The formerly rotund
actor appeared weakened and thin as he accepted the award.
   In his lengthy career, Blier played nearly every type of role.
   From his first film in 1937, Raymond Rouleau's ``Trois, Six,
Neuf'' (Three, Six, Nine), followed by six other movies that same
year, Blier was rarely without work. He made his last movie in
1988, Moshe Mizrahi's ``Mangeclous.''
   ``My work is my joie de vivre,'' Blier once said. ``Never do I
go to the studio like one goes to an office.''
   Born on Jan. 11, 1916, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where his
biologist father was on assignment for the Pasteur Institute, Blier
even as a child longed to act. He studied at one point under the
actor Louis Jouvet, who reportedly told him: ``You'll start your
career at the age of 50.''
   Blier captured the public's eye and scored his first real
success with two movies made just after World War II: ``Quai des
Orfevres'' by Henri-Georges Clouzot and Yves Allegres' ``Dede
d'Anvers.''
   Among Blier's most notable films were ``Hotel du Nord'' (North
Hotel) directed by Marcel Carne (1938); ``Avant le Deluge'' (Before
the Deluge) by Andre Cayatte (1953), and ``Calmos'' and ``Buffet
Froid,'' made in 1975 and 1979, respectively, under the direction
of his son.
   Blier also made about 30 movies in Italy.

<HEAD>Heavy Rains Cause Flooding in Texas; Snowmelt Floods in Michigan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Torrential rains swept across eastern Texas on Wednesday,
bursting an earthen dam and causing widespread flooding. There was
flooding in northern Michigan, where melting snow filled rivers to
overflowing.
   In the Midwest, heavy snow fell from northeastern North Dakota
to northern Minnesota. Eleven inches of snow fell at Petersburg,
N.D.
   A low-pressure system that moved from south central to eastern
Texas produced powerful showers and thunderstorms, dumping heavy
rains overnight from eastern Texas into Louisiana and Arkansas.
   Over 14 inches of rain fell in 24 hours at Longview, Texas,
about 60 miles west of Shreveport, La. More than 12 inches fell at
Atlanta, Texas, and Chalk Hill, Texas, and more than five inches at
Texarkana, Ark.
   An earthen dam burst at Nix Lake, near Henderson, Texas, and the
floodwaters pushed a car off Texas Highway 43, killing a man. Other
people were left stranded in trees until rescuers arrived in boats.
   Numerous roads were closed across northeast Texas due to high
water. Across the border in Texarkana, Ark., some homes had 2 feet
of water inside and cars were washed off roads.
   As the thunderstorms moved eastward into Mississippi, between 2
and 3 inches of rain fell near the Mississippi River. Winds damaged
a house and toppled trees at Vicksburg, Miss., and similar damage
was reported elsewhere across Mississippi and Alabama.
   Flash flood watches were posted from Texas and Oklahoma to
Louisiana and Mississippi.
   Six counties in north-central Michigan declared states of
emergency as rivers topped their banks and runoff from melting snow
washed out roads.
   A flood watch also was posted for areas of New York state east
of Lake Ontario, where rainfall and melting snow were expected to
cause streams and rivers to overflow, as well as in parts of
northern New England.
   Rainfall also was expected to move into western Pennsylvania and
cause rivers to rise. A river flood watch was posted for Thursday
and Friday along the Allegheny, Clarion and upper Ohio rivers.
   Rain fell across much of the lower Ohio Valley.
   In the West, rain showers and snow showers were scattered over
the northern Intermountain region.
   Warm weather continued along the East Coast. Temperatures
climbed into the 80s from the Gulf Coast to the middle and southern
Atlantic Coast states.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 21
degrees at Duluth, Minn., to 93 degrees at Brownsville, Texas. The
nation's low was 15 degrees at Marquette, Mich.
   The forecast for Thursday called for scattered showers and
thundershowers from eastern portions of the southern plains to the
lower and middle Mississippi Valley, the Gulf Coast states, the
Ohio Valley, the Great Lakes and Atlantic Coast; rain over much of
the Pacific Northwest; and snow mixed with rain over northern New
England and upper Michigan.
   Highs were expected to be in the 30s from North Dakota to
northern Minnesota, northern portions of the upper Great Lakes, and
northern New England; the 40s and 50s from the Pacific Northwest to
the northern and central Rockies, South Dakota and Nebraska,
southern Minnesota and the middle Mississippi Valley, northern
portions of the Ohio Valley, southern portions of the upper Great
Lakes and all of the lower Great Lakes to the middle Atlantic
Coast; the 80s from Southern California to southern Arizona, Texas
except the panhandle, the Gulf Coast, Florida and southern Georgia;
the 90s over the desert Southwest; and in the 60s and 70s in much
of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>First Bats, Now Cats at University of Central Florida</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Central Florida, finally
rid of its bats, turned its attention Wednesday to 100 stray cats.
   Many of the felines, frequently pregnant, have been there since
the early 1970s, living on handouts and hunting mice and birds.
   The biggest concern over proliferating kitties is the continuing
fear that they'll give people rabies. Animal advocates don't agree,
saying rabies in cats is extremely rare.
   But administrators feared a cat bite could bring legal action
and considered extermination. Caring students resisted, perhaps
remembering tabbies back home.
   School attorney Ashmun Brown met Wednesday with Humane Society
Director Frank Andrews and Heather Harden, president of UCF Campus
Action for Animals, formed a month ago.
   They drafted a plan to capture the cats, find them homes, and
get them temporary lodging.
   ``I'm praying that we can finally get moving on this,'' said Ms.
Hardin, a UCF junior majoring in anthropology. ``These animals have
suffered long enough.''
   Ms. Hardin negotiated agreements with area veterinarians to
provide free vaccination and sterilization, and her group compiled
a list of potential adoptive owners.
   The school's last animal ``crisis'' occurred in the fall, when a
bat colony turned up in the gym.
   The flying mammals made a terrible mess, drove basketball
players, volleyball teams and even weightlifters into the street,
and even disrupted a graduation ceremony.
   A bat expert contacted in late December put wire-mesh plugs into
tiny cracks and crevices, enabling bats to leave but preventing
them from returning. They gradually moved on to other locales.

<HEAD>Accused Mass Murderer Told Police He was `Drunk and Crazy'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man told police he was ``drunk and crazy''
and didn't remember firing weapons in the 1987 shopping center
rampage that killed six people and wounded 10, according to a
videotape played for jurors Wednesday.
   ``I know I must have got in some trouble tonight. I don't know
what happened, but whatever it was I'm sorry it happened,'' William
Cruse told interrogators 90 minutes after his capture in Palm Bay.
   ``I don't remember firing at all,'' Cruse said. ``I don't
remember what happened. That's the honest truth.''
   Asked why he left home that day, Cruse told police ``I was drunk
and I was crazy. I wasn't in my right mind and that's for sure.''
   Cruse is charged with six counts of first-degree murder, 24
counts of attempted first-degree murder and two counts of
kidnapping.
   Prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty, played about an
hour of the 2{-hour interview to counter defense claims that Cruse,
61, was temporarily insane the night of April 23, 1987.
   When told he fired on people at two shopping centers, Cruse
said, ``I don't believe it. You think I did that?''
   Cruse said he didn't set out with the intention of doing any
harm. Asked if he knew he had done something bad, Cruse replied,
``I must have. I'm here.''
   When an officer told him: ``You shot some policemen there,''
Cruse said, ``Pardon me?''
   Two police officers were among those killed.
   Prosecutors say Cruse armed himself with a semiautomatic rifle,
a shotgun and a handgun and shot at just about everything that
moved during a seven-hour siege.
   At one point while talking about weapons, Cruse blurted, ``I'm
sorry I bought the damn things.''
   Assistant State Attorney Wayne Holmes said the videotape was
shown to show Cruse's demeanor after his arrest.
   The state maintains that the former librarian was angry, not
legally insane, when he opened fire at the two Palm Bay shopping
centers.
   Duing the interview, Cruse described himself as ``kind of
wasted.''
   He said he used to be able to drink wine and beer and go to bed
and sleep it off, but not anymore. ``I've got to stay away from the
wine and beer because it drives me crazy,'' he said.
   The state planned to present two psychiatric experts of its own
in rebuttal to defense mental health specialists who labeled Cruse
a paranoid schizophrenic.

<HEAD>Pravda: Moldavian Demonstrators Infected with `Nationalist Virus'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Demonstrators impatient for change under new
Soviet policies are wrongly turning to violence in Moldavia, Pravda
said Wednesday.
   Thousands of demonstrators with signs reading ``Down with the
Government'' gathered March 19 in Kishinev, the tiny western
republic's capital, the Communist Party daily said.
   A week earlier, more than 20,000 staged a similar protest and
several police officers were seriously injured, it said.
   The grass-roots political groups that organized the protests
seek changes in the republic's language and economic and
environmental policies, as well as a crackdown on widespread crime
and corruption, Pravda said.
   Pravda criticized the Moldavian Communist Party leadership for
adjusting too slowly to the republic's changing political life and
letting the protests get out of hand.
   But it also branded some of the local activists ``aspiring
politicians, ambitious men, and simply unbalanced and socially
immature people.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has allowed greater autonomy for
the Soviet republics under his reform policy of perestroika.
However, Pravda said the Moldavian activists were allowing their
impatience for change to be infected with the ``virus of
nationalistic narrow-mindedness.''
   On Feb. 25, the republic's Party chief, Semyon Grossu, condemned
nationalist activists for going too far but endorsed a demand to
change the Moldavian alphabet to Latin script as it is in Romania.
   Moldavian and Romanian are the same spoken language, but
dictator Josef Stalin imposed the Cyrillic, or Russian alphabet, on
the Moldavians after Soviet troops occupied the region during World
War II.
   Grossu said work is under way to gradually reinstitute the Latin
script still used in neighboring Romania.
   Moldavia has retained close ties with Romania despite repeated
attempts by Moscow to link it more closely with Russia. The region
of 4.2 million people has passed from Turkish to Russian to
Romanian and back to Soviet control over the past century.

<DATELINE>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fiery explosion tore through a
$15 million automated rocket fuel mixing building at Hercules
Aerospace on Wednesday, damaging the building but causing no
injuries, officials said.
   The early morning blast jolted the western Salt Lake Valley and
lit up the night sky, but eight to 10 workers at the site remained
protected in a distant bunker, company spokesman Jack DeMann said.
   By midday, investigators and officials from Hercules Inc.'s
headquarters in Wilmington, Del., the Air Force and the state
Division of Occupational Safety and Health were probing the
wreckage of the mixing building and adjacent structures, said
spokesman Ted Olsen.
   ``It could be weeks before the cause is determined,'' he added.
   He said static electricity, friction and potential problems with
the mixture all would have to be considered as possible causes.
   The explosion occurred at 12:05 a.m. in a new section of the
plant while 25,000 pounds of HTPB propellant was being prepared for
a Delta II space rocket booster motor, DeMann said.
   The fuel is mixed in giant bowls by stainless steel blades that
leave it with the consistency of heavy batter. The fuel then is
poured into rocket cases and cured until it becomes solid.
   Hercules fire crews responded but, acting on company policy, did
not try to fight the fire, DeMann said. It died out quickly.
   The building in which the fuel was mixed is made of concrete and
reinforced steel with an interior wall separated by 10 feet of
earth from an exterior wall.
   The explosion at the 7,000-acre Hercules complex, which is about
20 miles southwest of downtown Salt Lake City, was the first in 14
years, DeMann said.
   A similar blast on Dec. 29, 1987, killed five workers at Morton
Thiokol's Wasatch Operations in northern Utah.
   The mixing buildings at the Hercules plant are used to make
solid fuel propellant for the Delta II, the Titan IV, the Trident
II, and the MX and small ICBM missiles.
   Olsen said the incident likely would have little impact on the
Delta program since a new mixing building already was under
construction at the site.

   A military plane carrying a general,
election officials and a TV news crew ditched on a sand bar in the
South China Sea on Wednesday, but all 12 people aboard were saved,
officials said.
   Philippine air force station commander Col. Santiago Medrana
said the twin-engine Nomad plane was found off tiny Ramos Island on
the southern tip of Palawan in the western Philippines. He said the
nine passengers and three crew were not hurt.
   ``The aircraft was able to land on a sand bar,'' Medrana said in
a telephone interview. ``The plane was intact and capable of
flying.''
   The plane left Puerto Princesa, capital of Palawan, on a flight
to supervise local elections on the Spratly islands, about 500
miles to the west.
   Maj. Antonio Babijes, chief of the Manila Rescue Coordinating
Center, said the pilot later radioed he was returning to Puerto
Princesa, and search operations began after the plane failed to
return.
   Passengers included Brig. Gen. Napoleon Angeles, commander of
the western military district, five officials of the Commission on
Elections, and a three-member crew from Manila television station
GMA.
   The Spratlys are claimed by the Philippines, China, Taiwan,
Malaysia and Vietnam.

   Oscar producer Allan Carr promised the
Academy Awards' opening number would be the most exciting 15
minutes in television history.
   It seemed like hours.
   For the record, the man who took ``La Cage Aux Folles'' to
Broadway tried to fulfill his promise with a Snow White lookalike
trilling ``Proud Mary'' to Hollywood brat packer Rob Lowe.
   That was after the dancers, encased in glittery, golden
five-pointed stars, trooped onstage.
   As Oscar audience members stared blankly, a Snow White
impersonator with a voice reminiscent of another cartoon heroine _
Betty Boop _ strolled through the Shrine Auditorium singing spoofs
of popular songs rewritten with Oscar-oriented lyrics.
   A groan swept through the crowded Oscar press room minutes later
when a somber Lowe, cast as Prince Charming, tried to sing and
dance. He came up a few octaves and steps short.
   All of this took place in a recreation of the Cocoanut Grove,
the nightclub where the Academy Awards were originally presented.
   Amid a bevy of sequined hoofers, crooner Merv Griffin introduced
various Cocoanut Grove diners, including veteran actors Vincent
Price, Alice Faye, Dorothy Lamour and Roy Rogers.
   Dancer Cyd Charisse unreeled a few classic tango steps.
   When the number mercifully ended, Lily Tomlin strode down a
grand staircase at center stage.
   ``Well I told them that I'd be thrilled to do the Oscars if they
could just come up with an entrance,'' she said. ``And think of it,
more than a billion and a half people just watched that. And at
this very moment they're trying to make sense of it.''
   As she made her entrance, Miss Tomlin intentionally lost a shoe.
She joked about it, recalling the late Ed Sullivan's propensity for
calling a really great show a ``really great shoe.'' A dancer from
the chorus line crawled down the steps behind her, recovered the
shoe and tossed it offstage.

   ``Pelle the Conqueror,'' an austere tale
about a father and son forging a new life in harsh Danish farm
country, brought Denmark its second consecutive Oscar for foreign
language film Wednesday night.
   The Scandinavian country won its first Academy Award last year
with ``Babette's Feast.''
   ``Oh it's so exciting,'' said a nervous Bille August, the
director and writer. ``I made a film about a poor immigrant from
Denmark and here I am standing in my tuxedo and this shiny thing,''
he said holding up his statuette.
   The story is told through the eyes of Pelle Hvenegaard, a
Swedish boy who accompanies his widower father, played by Max Von
Sydow, on a perilous adventure early in the century. Pelle finds
his new home exciting and forbidding as he draws inner strength
from his and his father's sufferings.
   ``I think it means a lot to Danish film,'' August said when
asked about the significance of the award. ``It is very important
to people in film in my country.''
   Thirty-one countries submitted entries in this year's Academy
Awards. Selection of each nation's entry is made by a jury composed
of filmmakers from that country and only one film, which need not
be released in the United States, is accepted.
   The Foreign Language Film Award Committee screened all entries
before voting to nominate five films.

   Federal safety officials are calling for
tougher drunken driving laws and want the oldest one-fifth of the
nation's school buses off the road, in response to the United
States' worst alcohol-related highway accident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board, ending its inquiry
into the May 1988 head-on collision that killed 24 children and
three adults aboard a Kentucky church bus, adopted a long list of
recommendations for federal and state officials Tuesday.
   Flames spread through the bus after it collided with a pickup
truck that was going the wrong way on Interstate 71 near
Carrollton, Ky. Authorities said the pickup driver had a blood
alcohol content of .26 in tests 90 minutes after the accident, and
a board investigator said Tuesday he likely was at .29 when the
collision occurred, which is nearly three times the legal level of
presumed intoxication.
   All 27 deaths aboard the bus, which belonged to the First
Assembly of God in Radcliff, were attributed to smoke inhalation,
the board said. Forty people escaped, most with injuries. The bus
was returning from an amusement park near Cincinnati.

   The Bush administration is cutting funding in

   The administration wants Contra leaders to return to Nicaragua
to test promises made by the leftist Sandinista government of an
open political process, said Alfredo Cesar, a member of the rebels'

   The United States has been spending $4.8 million a year to

in Miami and Central America.
   Under the new policy, the Contras are being urged to take part
in the national elections scheduled by the Sandinistas for February

   Politicians stumped for memorable quotations
to enliven their speeches need look no further than ``Respectfully
Quoted,'' a newly published book from the Library of Congress that
is crammed with 2,100 oratorical gems from the past.
   The book might give some comfort to Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del.,
whose 1988 presidential hopes were torpedoed partly by a
controversy over cribbed comments.
   If Biden recalls a famous line from President Kennedy's
inaugural address in 1961, he might be intrigued that Lebanese
writer Kahlil Gibran asked much earlier, ``Are you a politician
asking what your country can do for you, or a zealous one asking
what you can do for your country?''
   The book, a three-year project by Suzy Platt of the library's

which members of Congress or their staffs over the past 75 years
have asked the library to verify for their exact wording and

<HEAD>Church ``Elite'' Divided On Social-Political Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ``elite'' of American Christianity, those in
the upper echelons of power and influence, are found in a new study
to be sharply divided in their social-political views.
   They also assume different priorities for their common faith.
   On economic and military issues, both mainline Protestant and
Roman Catholic leaders are on the left and fundamentalists on the
right. On family-sexual issues, mainliners remain on the left, but
Catholics join fundamentalists on the right.
   ``The ideological polarization is immense,'' says social
scientist S. Robert Lichter of Washington, who made the study with
two colleagues. He added in a telephone interview:
   ``The differences seem to define the left and right poles of
American political discourse. What surprised me is that the
mainline Protestant leaders are so far to the left, and Catholic
leaders also are to the left on economic issues.''
   The study involved replies to extensive questionnaires by 178
influential figures of mainline Protestantism, Catholicism and
Protestant fundamentalism, compiled through nominations by
denominations and religious journals.
   Lichter, co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs,
conducted the study with social scientists Stanley Rothman and
Robert Learner of Smith College's Center for the Study of Social
and Political Change.
   Leaders of mainline Protestantism, an establishment that
historically has set the tone for American society, were found
``liberal on every dimension,'' although members are fairly
conservative, as shown in other studies.
   Eighty percent of them say they are political liberals, as do 59
percent of Catholics, compared to only 13 percent of
fundamentalists, differences paralleling recent voting records.
   Catholic and mainline leaders are ``much more critical of
capitalism,'' about a fourth of them saying the U.S. should ``move
toward socialism,'' with big corporations ``taken out of private
ownership and run in the public interest.''
   In contrast, only 4 percent of fundamentalist leaders feel that
way.
   Only slight majorities of mainline Protestant and Catholic
leaders _ 52 and 64 percent respectively _ believe private
enterprise is fair to workers, compared to an overwhelming 91
percent of fundamentalists.
   More than 80 percent of mainline Protestants and Catholics favor
government action to reduce the income gap between rich and poor,
compared to only 43 percent of fundamentalist leaders.
   The fundamentalists also are more hawkish than either mainline
Protestants or Catholics, with majorities of fundamentalists saying
the U.S. should be more forceful with the Soviet Union, compared to
only minorities of Protestants and Catholics.
   Most fundamentalists also think it is sometimes necessary to
undermine a foreign government and that the U.S. military should be
the strongest no matter what the cost, with only about a fourth of
Catholics and Protestants agreeing.
   But on most sexual-family issues, the alignments change. Only
small minorities of Catholics and fundamentalists _ 22 and 17
percent respectively _ say women have a right to abortion, compared
to 67 percent of Protestants.
   Also most Catholics and fundamentalists, 64 and 83 percent, say
women with young children should not work unless necessary,
compared to 28 percent of Protestants.
   Majorities of all three groups consider adultery wrong and also
consider homosexual relations wrong, but only fundamentalists
predominantly say homosexuals should not teach in public schools.
   Majorities of Catholic and Protestant leaders say preference
should be given in hiring blacks and women, but only a minority of
fundamentalists say so.
   Concerning Christian priorities, most Catholics and Protestants
_ 54 and 57 percent _ and 95 percent of fundamentalists say
bringing people to faith in Jesus should be the main church focus
in the United States.
   That also should be the main church focus abroad, say 90 percent
of fundamentalists, compared to only 51 percent of Catholics and 46
percent of Protestants, about a fourth or more giving priority to
improving the lot of the poor.
   The choices here, as in other areas, were related to political
ideology, the report says.
   It notes that the vast majority of self-described conservatives
select faith in Jesus as the church's top domestic priority,
compared to a minority _ 41 percent _ of liberals.
   ``Catholic leaders resemble their mainline Protestant
counterparts except on issues of sexual morality, on which they
agree more closely with the fundamentalists,'' the report sums up,
adding:
   ``The views these leaders hold on the public face of the church
are closely related to their own political values. Thus, religion
and politics seem as intertwined in the lives of America's
religious leaders as they are in the life of American society.''

<TEXT>
   Amid two weeks of protests in February against racial incidents
at Penn State University, a young white man grabbed a black student
by the arm and punched her in the eye. ``Why don't you protest
this,'' he said.
   During the past two years, 160 U.S. colleges have reported
incidents aimed at black, Hispanic, Asian and homosexual students
and faculty, said Howard J. Uhrlich of the National Institute
Against Prejudice and Violence.
   ``Between 20 and 25 percent of all minority students on campus
have been victimized at least once during an academic year,''
Uhrlich said, citing verbal harassment, cross-burnings, hate
literature, beatings, brawls, anti-homosexual graffiti, swastikas
and racially motivated slurs.
   ``The heart of the problem for many large campuses like ours is
that a majority of our white students grew up in suburban areas or
small comunities. They have had no positive experiences with
minorities,'' said Grant Ingle, acting director of human relations
at the University of Massachusetts, where a 1986 argument over the
World Series erupted into a racial brawl.
   Pressured by student minority groups, colleges increasingly are
naming provosts for minority affairs, recruiting and retaining more
non-white teachers and creating programs to improve understanding.
   _A minicourse titled ``Race and Rutgers'' began this semester to
explore race relations at the New Jersey university since the 1960s.
   _William Chace, president of Wesleyan University in Middletown,
Conn., sent students a letter in January that discussed racial
relations on campus and the film ``Mississippi Burning'' about the
1964 murders of civil rights activists.
   _Stanford University President Donald Kennedy reported in
February on an incident in which two students were barred from
campus housing for two quarters for defacing a Beethoven poster
with caricatures of a black person and leaving it near a black
student's door.
   _Eighty-eight percent of the freshman entering the University of
Wisconsin this fall will have to fulfill a new ethnic studies
credit requirement.
   Some minority students, calling attention to the issue with
protests and sit-ins, have labeled these efforts window-dressing.
They charge that colleges have not responded quickly enough and
have not issued stiff enough penalties.
   Other critics question administrators' commitment to diversity.
   ``Some universities have created a (minority affairs) office or
program and say they solved the problem. I see on many campuses
where the minority affairs officer doesn't have any power,'' said
Reginald Wilson, senior scholar at the American Council on
Education in Washington, D.C.
   ``Yet when you ask people on campus who is responsible, they
point to that person,'' Wilson said. ``Generally, the colleges that
seem to be responding, unfortunately, are the ones where something
has happened.''
   Since the October 1986 World Series brawl at the University of
Massachusetts, the school has instituted a tougher conduct code
that more clearly defines what disciplinary action can be taken. It
also has reinstated a freshman orientation program that encourages
racial harmony.
   ``Our World Series event was the most visible major racial clash
on a U.S. campus. I think we've been forced to do more in response
than others,'' said James Langley, an associate vice chancellor.
   Today's students ``did not live through the civil rights
movement. Some don't know the significance of Martin Luther King
Jr. Some don't even know who he was,'' Langley said. Despite
effforts to recruit minorities and to keep the issue in the
forefront, ``We have a situation that needs close watching. This
campus is not settled. It's not calm,'' he said.
   ``This university has not had any true commitment to
diversity,'' said Traci Davis, 20, of Springfield, Mass., a membe
of a minority-rights group on the Amherst campus. She said the
university needs to redouble its efforts.
   Penn State a year ago hung posters at its 22 campuses
proclaiming: ``Racism Has No Place at Penn State.'' The posters,
which included telephone numbers to report incidents, were a way
for the university to acknowledge that there some people thought
racism was a problem on campus, said Patricia Peterson, assistant
vice president for campus life.
   Black students, who said five black women were accosted by
whites as they walked downtown near the campus, demonstrated in
February. Chanting ``Racism no. Racism must go,'' they demanded
stiffer penalties for racist acts.
   ``Right now they (administrators) are doing surface changes,''
said Yvette Dudley, president of the NAACP chapter at Penn State.
``They say they are open to changes, but we haven't seen any
structural changes.''
   Nearly a year after implementing the Madison Plan, a blueprint
for increasing minority participation on the University of
Wisconsin campus, the Interfraternity Council expelled a fraternity
in November for incidents that included a slave auction where
pledges donned blackface and afro wigs in skits that mimicked
contemporary black entertainers. That action came a week after a
university committee announced it could not punish the fraternity.
   ``The university still hasn't developed an effective plan for
disciplining students,'' said Charles J. Holley, past president of
the Black Student Union.
   Not all the incidents involve race.
   The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force in Washington, D.C.,
last year surveyed gay student groups on U.S. campuses. More than
70 percent of the 80 to 90 groups that responded reported some or
much discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation,
said Kevin Berrill, a task force director.
   ``I think most colleges aren't doing anything,'' Berrill said.
``A couple of schools have taken steps, but most administrators are
not dealing adequately with the problem. They have their heads in
the sand.''

<HEAD>In Uncertain Climate, CDs Thriving</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belying their long history as a simple, stodgy
savings tool, certificates of deposit have lately become a hot _
and not so simple _ investment.
   At a time when the bloom is off the boom in mutual funds and
many small investors are shunning the stock market, CDs have
received an added boost from the sharp rise in interest rates over
the past several months.
   Banks and savings institutions have been slow to raise the
interest rates they pay on money market accounts.
   But in many areas of the country, they are competing feverishly
to attract depositors with generous yields on CDs carrying
maturities in the six-month to one-year range.
   Brokerage firms, meanwhile, are offering wide selections of CDs
from banks across the country, in a bid to open or keep accounts
for customers who aren't interested in the other merchandise on
their shelves.
   At least two newsletters now compile and publish information on
the highest yields available for savers interested in buying
out-of-state CDs by mail.
   Just to keep the pot bubbling, there is the problem of insolvent
savings and loans that the government is now struggling to solve.
   Even with federal deposit insurance covering deposits of up to
$100,000, CD buyers are now putting increased emphasis on checking
into the financial health of an institution before they entrust it
with their money.
   Many investment advisers these days are recommending that savers
buy CDs from a brokerage firm.
   A broker can offer convenience and a wide selection of CDs,
quite possibly with yields higher than what local banks are willing
to pay.
   The brokers typically collect their fees from the institutions
issuing the CDs, so the buyer has no commission to pay.
Furthermore, a broker may offer to buy back a CD from you before it
matures, eliminating the customary penalty for early withdrawal.
   ``A broker would rather see you invest in stocks, bonds or
something he or she would make a higher commission on,'' says
Robert Heady in his newsletter 100 Highest Yields, published in
North Palm Beach, Fla.
   ``But if your mind is made up on CDs, getting them for you is
better than watching you walk out the door.
   ``The problem is that many brokers don't look closely at the CD
choices. They're made at corporate headquarters.''
   Heady argues that you cannot assume brokers have thoroughly
checked the financial status of all the issuers of the CDs they
have for sale.
   He also says many brokered CDs pay only ``simple'' rather than
``compound'' interest.
   What's the difference? Over time, compounding significantly
increases your actual yield _ the amount of money your investment
earns. The more rapid the compounding, the greater the benefit.
   To illustrate this point, notes the Boston-based United &amp; Babson
Investment Report, a one-year CD with a stated interest rate of 10
percent compounded daily would pay you more than a similar CD at
10.5 percent simple interest.
   If you are inclined to buy an out-of-town CD directly by mail,
Norman Fosback, editor of the newsletter Income &amp; Safety in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., offers these suggestions:
   ``Telephone an institution and verify that the quoted rate is
still in effect, and that the institution will pay interest from
day of deposit without a `hold.'
   ``Ask for a preassigned account number. Mark your check `For
Deposit Only,' and send a covering letter with full instructions,
including your telephone number.''

<HEAD>Republicans Face Long Odds in Fight for House Majority</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The good news, according to the million-dollar
campaign manager, is that Republicans are at rock-bottom strength
with the 174 House seats the party now holds. In the era of nearly
invincible incumbents, that also is their bad news.
   While that means Republican strength probably won't go much
lower, it also means the odds are prohibitive against any swift
comeback from 34 years without a House majority.
   Ed Rollins, who was a White House political adviser to Ronald
Reagan and managed his landslide re-election campaign in 1984, is
the man assigned to find the way back. It involves the political
equivalent of heavy lifting, but it pays well _ $250,000 a year,
probably over the next four years.
   That price tag was not popular, stirring resentment among some
of its presumed beneficiaries, since House members are earning
$89,500 and didn't dare to vote themselves a raise this year.
   Rollins is the new co-chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, the party's House campaign organization.
He says his goal is to make Republicans competitive for the 218
seats that make up a House majority, which they haven't had since
the 1954 elections. According to Rollins, that would put the GOP in
position to reclaim the majority in the mid-1990s.
   They start at what Rollins calls a low point, 174 out of 435
seats. That's down from 192 after Ronald Reagan's election in 1980.
Rollins figures there are 160 safe GOP seats, in districts so
securely Republican that they'd stay that way even if the national
campaign organization shut down and did nothing to help.
   But seats that look safe come with no guarantees, as
demonstrated Tuesday when the Republicans lost the Indiana House
seat once held by Vice President Dan Quayle. Democrat Jill Long
took over a seat that had been Republican since 1976. That gives
the Democrats 259 House seats, with two vacancies awaiting special
elections.
   Republicans are trying return the favor next week in Alabama,
where a special election will fill the seat left vacant by the
death of Rep. Bill Nichols, the longtime Democratic incumbent.
   That overall margin probably insulates the Republicans against
significant House losses in 1990. The party holding the White House
usually has suffered House setbacks in mid-term elections, because
the president's party normally gained swing seats on his coattails
in the previous election. But President Bush had no such coattails
_ the GOP lost three House seats in 1988.
   So there is no realignment pending in 1990, in either direction.
But the sheer size of the Democratic margin and the better than 9
out of 10 liklihood that an incumbent will be re-elected confront
Rollins and the Republicans with a mountain to be scaled on the way
to anything approaching House control.
   Rollins already has started Republican groundwork for the
reapportionment that will follow the 1990 census, which is expected
to shift 18 House seats out of the Northeast and parts of the
Midwest, most of them to the southern and southwestern states that
have become Republican territory.
   But there will be redistricting to reflect population shifts
even in states that do not lose or gain seats. Rollins says
Republicans will have the technical and legal know-how, and the
political message to take advantage of the changes.
   There's no way to guess the outcome, but the last time a
reapportioned House was elected along with a president, in 1972,
Republicans won nearly two-thirds of the open seats.
   Rollins talks of emerging from the next two elections with net
GOP gains of 30 seats, saying that would put a re-elected President
Bush within range of a House majority for administration programs
during a second term. He said it would be a philosophical majority,
like the coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats that
gave Reagan his early House victories.
   If Rollins can deliver that kind of progress, he'll not only
earn his money, he probably should put in for a bonus.
   He advocates a strategy based on confrontation rather than
compromise, telling reporters that Republican House leaders always
should think in campaign terms. ``We are in combat,'' he says. That
hard line fits the style of Republican National Chairman Lee
Atwater and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, newly-elected as the No.
2 man in the minority leadership.
   It doesn't mesh with President Bush's ideas about bipartisanship
in administration dealings with the Democratic Congress. But
Rollins doesn't argue; he says whatever works to keep the president
popular works to the advantage of GOP candidates.
   Rollins says confrontation be part of a two-track strategy, with
Republicans going after Democrats back home in their House
districts even while the Bush administration seeks bipartisan
support for its proposals in Washington.
   But when Bush needs Democratic votes there is going to have to
be some political bargaining.
   And if that leads to a call from the White House asking GOP
political operators to lay off Democrats who may side with the
administration?
   ``I hope Mr. Atwater is the one who gets that call,'' said
Rollins.

<HEAD>Algerian Party's Power Monopoly to be Contested in Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GOLDSMITH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweeping political and economic reforms
have been unleashed in Algeria by nationwide riots last year in
which hundreds died.
   Following a constitutional referendum that opened up the
one-party system, at least 19 political groups are planning to
contest the monopoly of the National Liberation Front in
legislative and municipal elections due this fall.
   The riots in October _ largely directed against the one-party
system instituted at the end of French colonial rule in 1962 _ left
176 dead by official count; government opponents cited figures of
500 or more killed. But they brought changes that fundamentally
transformed the structure of the state.
   The main architect of these changes was President Chadli
Bendjedid, who was re-elected to a five-year term in December
without opposition.
   Immediately following his election, Bendjedid opened a campaign
for a new constitution, which eliminated ``socialism'' from the
basic principles of the Algerian state and paved the way for the
introduction of a multi-party system. The constitution was approved
Feb. 24 by 73.4 percent of those voting.
   In the current period of transition, the 19 groups _ ranging
from the Communist Party and Islamic fundamentalists to
Western-oriented liberal and social democratic parties _ are
adopting their statutes and future programs.
   Abderezak Bouhara, executive secretary of the National
Liberation Front, said there was no reason why a ``renewed and
revigorated party'' could not confront the democratic opposition of
other groups for the defense of what he called Algeria's
``socialist achievements.''
   ``The front is perfectly capable of playing the democratic
game,'' he added.
   But Ali Belhadj, leader of the Islamic Salvation Front and
regarded as one of the unconditional extremists of the Islamic
movement, said, ``We are for the full and unrestricted application
of Islamic sharia law. Our only constitution is the Koran, and the
place of women is in the home.''
   Other political opinions ranged widely. The Rally for Culture
and Democracy demands that Amazigh, the language of the Kabyle
people who have lived in Algeria since before the Arabs arrived, be
recognized as a national language of Algeria. The leader of the
Social Democrats, Abderrahmane Adjerid, said, ``We do not only want
to distribute wealth but to create it, notably by encouraging
private enterprise.''
   Some time later this year, an extraordinary congress of the
National Liberation Front will take account of the changes and
adopt a policy for the future. Until then, President Bendjedid
remains the party's president and one of his close allies,
Abdelhamid Mehri, its secretary-general.
   An anomoly of the the present period of transition, the ruling
party remains dedicated to socialism and one-party domination.
   In fact, rejecting views vigorously expressed by Mehri, the
party congress took a position against the new constitution. This
reflected the views of the party stalwarts who feared for their
entrenched jobs and positions.
   But the party was greatly weakened shortly afterwards by the
simultaneous resignation of all its army members. Many government
officials are said to be looking to one of the 19 new parties for
their future political allegiance.
   The new constitution requires that any political group that
requests it be officially recognized and allowed to take part in
the future elections. The only condition is that the party should
uphold the constitution itself.
   The National Liberation Front's official organ, Revolution
Africaine, foresaw a plot to liquidate the party, beginning with
the ``probability of an abandonment of the party by its
president,'' Bendjedid himself.
   The chairman of one of the budding new parties said the
president would form his own party and take into it all those loyal
to him.
   Sources close to the president, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said it was ``not unlikely'' that those loyal to
Bendjedid would seek to establish a new party. They said the
president himself intended to remain above the political turmoil.
   Some sources said the simplest solution to the National
Liberation Front's problems would be to change its name. But
Revolution Africaine commented that there was ``genuine risk of the
disintegration of the state and a danger for the construction of
socialism in our country.''
   This official party view runs close to an open statement of
opposition to Bendjedid.
   It is not clear whether the president's adroit maneuvering will
enable him to continue in control of the party long enough to take
charge of a new, more liberal, political grouping likely to win
majority support in the Algeria of the future.

   In 1949, a time of intense West-West
suspicion and hostility, the United States, Canada and 10 European
nations created the NATO alliance to thwart what they saw as a
military threat from Stalin's expansionist Soviet Union.
   Now, 40 year later, the world has changed, the West European
allies are soothed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev's words and actions.
They have become less committed to the United States and they
foresee a stronger, independent Western Europe.
   ``Some of the glue of the last 40 years is losing its potency,''
said John Cross, deputy directaor of the International Institute
for Strategic Studies in London. ``It will need to be replaced by a
renewed sense of purpose and vision of the way ahead.''
   And so, this is the state of North Atlantic Treaty Organization
as it marks its 40th anniversary April 4.
   ``We have to adjust ... to new developments,'' NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said in an interview.
   ``That of course is a phase which you could call a crossroad _
not changing our basic course but giving it a new vitality, perhaps
even new speed and adjusting to new challenges.''
   President Bush and other NATO leaders are expected to take a
fresh look at the alliance's role at a summit May 29-30 at NATO's
headquarters in Brussels.
   ``The alliance is at a point where it's less a problem of
managing a crisis but rather a problem of managing change,'' said
Ole Bierring, Denmark's ambassador to NATO.
   Jane Sharp, senior researcher at the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute in Sweden, said, ``Most of the problems
associated with NATO are byproducts of its success.''
   The key challenge facing the 16 nations of today's NATO still
comes from the Soviet Union.
   President Gorbachev's agenda of glasnost and perestroika and his
promises of reductions in troops and military spending have
diminished the perception of that threat _ at least in the public's
eyes.
   ``It is very, very appealing,'' said Gen. Wolfgang Altenburg of
West Germany, chairman of NATO's military committee.
   ``Since '45, the publics in Europe have lived under the
impression that, `Well, the war's over but it may start again.' But
now all of a sudden those nations which were considered to be the
big threat are apparently no longer a threat.''
   The alliance also faces changes among its members.
   Americans, seeing a prosperous Europe, question whether
Europeans should carry more of the defense burden. Europeans,
enjoying wealth and a stronger sense of identity, wonder why they
should put up with foreign troops and extensive maneuvers on their
soil.
   ``This whole question of burden-sharing is more or less the
question of which role Europe plays in the future,'' said
Secretary-General Woerner.
   Europe's future is being guided in part by ``1992,'' the plan by
the dozen nations of the European Economic Community to eliminate
trade barriers and form a single market by then. All but one _
Ireland _ belongs to NATO.
   Some defense officials worry the public euphoria over Gorbachev
will lessen support for defense spending and other commitments.
   The allies have just entered into new negotiations to try to
lessen the East's strength in conventional weapons.
   NATO wants the Soviets and their Warsaw Pact allies in Eastern
Europe to make much greater cuts to bring the two sides roughly to
equal strength.
   The starting positions of the two sides, unveiled in Vienna,
Austria, in early March, contain surprising similarities, leading
to optimism about an eventual accord.
   But the talks have also added fuel to possibly the most
controversial issue in NATO _ whether the alliance should modernize
short-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons.
   At the heart of the debate is a plan, pressed by the United
States and Britain, to upgrade the Lance surface-to-surface
missile. Military analysts say the Lance, introduced in 1972, will
become obsolete in 1995.
   The missile has a range of a little more than 60 miles. Its
replacement would have a range of more than 250 miles, just under
the limits of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty,
which eliminates U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of
about 300 to 3,400 miles.
   Gen. John Galvin, the American who is NATO's top military
commander in Europe, argues that modernizing the Lance will enable
NATO to make sharp cuts in nuclear artillery.
   The United States wants a firm commitment from the allies before
it urges Congress to approve money to produce the missile.
   But strong resistance in West Germany, where most of the weapons
would be based, has cast doubt.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany said recently he wants to
delay a decision on the production of the new missile until 1991 or
1992 _ after next year's important elections. He also wants an
agreement that deployment plans would be scrapped if progress were
made on cutting the East's conventional arms.
   Galvin said recently any discussions on reducing short-range
nuclear forces should be delayed until ``after we were satisfied
with the successes of the (conventional arms) agreement.''
   Alton Keel, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, insisted American
support for NATO remains strong.
   But he cautioned U.S. political backing could be put at risk if
the perception grew in the United States that Europeans were not as
committed.
   ``It's not now at risk ... but it could be,'' he said.

   Here is a description of NATO in capsule form.
   HISTORY _ The NATO treaty was signed April 4, 1949, in
Washington, D.C. Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France,
Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and
the United States aligned themselves against any military threat
from the Soviet Union. Greece, Turkey, West Germany and Spain
joined later. France, Spain and Iceland are not part of NATO's
integrated military structure.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   OBJECTIVE _ NATO seeks to maintain enough military forces to
deter an attack from the seven nations of the Soviet-led Warsaw
Pact in Eastern Europe while at the same time striving for
disarmament and detente. The key point of the treaty establishing
NATO says: ``The parties agree that an armed attack against one or
more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an
attack against them all.''

<HEAD>Churches Win Right To Sue Government For Spying Injuries</HEAD>

   Religious leaders are applauding a court
decision in which churches won the right to sue the government to
protect themselves against spying on their activities.
   The outcome could lead to an injunction against such snooping if
it is found to be common or might be repeated.
   Calling the decision ``beautiful,'' the Rev. James Andrews,
chief executive of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), commented:
   ``It makes a start on a much needed corrective. What it says is
that we are a democratic country, and government agents can't go
into your house, my house or God's house without a warrant.''
   If they do, they can be held liable, a federal appeals court
ruled in mid-March in a suit stemming from a 1985-86 sanctuary case.
   Bishop Herbert W. Chilstrom, head of the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America, said the decision clears the way for churches in
seeking ``to protect the integrity of their ministries from
government interference.''
   Seventeen religious groups, Protestant, Roman Catholic and
Jewish, had backed the suit challenging government infiltration of
congregations as undermining their ministry and abridging religious
freedom.
   The U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco,
asserting that churches have standing to sue on the basis of
injuries claimed from government surveilance, declared:
   ``When congregants are chilled from participating in worship
activities, when they refuse to attend church services because they
fear the government is spying on them and taping their every
utterance, all as alleged in the complaint, we think the church
suffers organizational injury because its ability to carry out its
ministries has been impaired.''
   Those crippling disruptions were reported by four Arizona
congregations, three of them Presbyterian and the other Lutheran,
as a result of undercover operations by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.
   Its paid informants were key witnesses in the 1986 conviction
and suspended sentencing of nine church workers including two
Catholic priests, a nun and a Presbyterian minister for helping
provide sanctuary to Central American refugees.
   Over a 10-month period, the appeals court related ``several INS
agents wearing `body bugs' infiltrated'' the four congregations,
attending services, recording prayers, discussions, Bible readings.
   As a result of the surveilance, carried out without warrants,
the court says the churches claimed these effects:
   Some ``members have withdrawn from active participation...a
Bible study group has been cancelled...support for the churches has
declined, and congregants have become reluctant to seek personal
counseling and are less open to prayers and confessions.''
   Chilstrom said ``the trust which binds a community together was
ruptured by unnecessarily invasive action by government.''
   Afterward, the four congregations, joined by their parent
bodies, the Presbyterian Church U.S.A., and the Evengelical
Lutheran Church in America, filed suit for damages and a
restraining order against the INS.
   Without seeking to justify the sanctuary movement, they charged
the secret government surveillance crippled their religious
functioning and also violated constitutional guarantees of free
exercise of religion.
   They asked that the INS be prohibited from such surveilance in
the future without ``prior established and compelling government
interest.''
   A district court in Arizona had thrown out the case without
trial, saying constitutional protections of religious rights apply
only to individuals, not church organizations, since ``churches
don't go to heaven.''
   Reversing that decision, appeals court Judge William Norris said
churches do come under constitutional protections, observing:
   ``It is the churches whose services have been invaded by the
government and whose congregants are the targets of the
surveilance,'' with a ``concrete threat'' that their ``religious
expressions are being recorded and put on file by the government.''
   Andrews said in an interview from Presbyterian headquarters in
Louisville that the decision means the government ``cannot hide
behind its status to avoid dealing with the issue of whether it was
doing something wrong.''
   He said the decision is important to all religious bodies,
adding:
   ``It doesn't say that churches can do anything they want just
because it's in a church building, but that the same procedural
protections of law apply there as well as anywhere else.''
   The appeals court said it was unable to assess the likelihood of
future INS surveilance of churches, and returned that issue to the
district court, along with the churches' request for an injunction
against such activity.
   Assuming the government won't carry the case to the U.S. Supreme
Court, Andrews said ``there'll now be a trial and a legitimate
opportunity to find out whether this surveilance is standard
procedure or what.
   ``The government will have to answer the question which it
didn't have to answer before _ whether it still is doing these
things. If we find out it's still occuring, we could get an
injunction against it.''

   A Southern Baptist layman who helped mobilize
the ``Christian right'' in politics warns against being linked to a
``cultural conservatism'' that doesn't involve belief in God.
   E.E. McAteer, a Tennessean who left a longtime business career
to become head of the conservative Religious Roundtable here, said
in a recent mailing that the movement ``has its roots firmly
planted in the Judeo-Christian ethic.''
   He adds that ``to embrace people who do not believe in God is
morally wrong and will result in the building of a political tower
of Babel.''
   Paul Weyrich, director of the Committee for the Survival of a
Free Congress, said in a subsequent mailing that cultural
conservatism is not ``some sort of godless philosophy'' that
considers God irrelevant, but he added:
   ``I welcome the help of all people who reach the same moral
conclusion even if they have not reached it on the basis of the
faith.''
   McAteer said he fears ``an attempt to use evangelical Christians
for purely political purposes.''

   Parodying the time-worn excuses people
give for not attending church, a pastor wrote in his parish paper a
satirical piece called, ``Ten Reasons Why I Never Wash,'' including:
   ``I was made to wash as a child.
   ``People who wash are hypocrites...they reckon they are cleaner
than other people.
   ``There are so many different kinds of soap, I could never
decide which one was right.''
   The information office of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
distributed the piece, written by the Rev. Sidney Laing of Dublin,
Ireland. It also included these reasons:
   ``I used to wash, but it got boring so I stopped.
   ``I still wash on special occasions, like Christmas and Easter.
   ``None of my friends wash.
   ``I'm still young _ when I'm older and have got a bit dirtier I
might start washing.
   ``People who make soap are only after your money.''

   Michael Corrigan heard the horror
stories in high school: Attend a large university and you'll be
just a number.
   Still, Corrigan had his heart set on the University of Michigan,
with a main campus enrollment of about 35,000. ``I wasn't scared
about the size of the university so much as I didn't want to not be
able to see my teacher when I wanted to if I was having a problem
or trouble with my work.''
   Then he found out he could have it both ways.
   Corrigan signed up for The Pilot Program, a ``living-learning
community'' that offers a personal approach to education through
small classes taught by instructors who are resident advisers in
the dormitory where the students live.
   The 26-year-old program, emulated at other schools, draws
freshmen and sophomores from all majors and cultural backgrounds.
Because of its size _ 400 students _ they also must take some
courses with the rest of the population.
   ``People who studied education in the '60s thought a lot about
the potential for combining academic life with the rest of life,''
said director Richard Meisler, known in the academic community for
his book, ``Trying Freedom: A Case for Liberating Education.''
   Pilot co-founder Donald R. Brown, now director of Michigan's
Center for Research on Learning and Teaching, said the
living-learning concept originated with monasteries, and at the
college level with Oxford-Cambridge. And while many small schools
operated with that theory in mind, the University of Michigan had
no large, public university to turn to for a model.
   ``None of the specific details were simply lifted, they were
really invented,'' he said, adding that the school's Residential
College, founded in 1967, evolved simultaneously. That program,
which also survives, is a four-year program which operates as a
full college with its own faculty.
   Out-of-classroom contact between students and instructors can be
a positive factor in student performance, said Russell Edgerton,
president of the American Association for Higher Education.
   Students would benefit more if tenured professors could
participate, Edgerton said, ``But the costs are just astronomical.
That's why students pay a lot more to attend small, liberal arts
colleges.''
   Administrators say the cost of educating a Pilot student is
comparable to that for other students, because the cost of
individualized attention is made up for by the lower cost of
graduate assistants and more efficient use of space. No extra fees
are charged for participation in the program.
   Edgerton said a current trend in education is ``federated
learning communities,'' in which a group of students takes three
classes with a common theme, such as poverty or hunger. The three
professors would work together on developing course material and
would team teach.
   At Indiana University's Collins Living-Learning Center, courses
usually are designed by a professor and only one faculty member
lives with the students, said Director Ernest Bernhardt-Kabisch.
   John Fowler, director of the Sewall Residential Academic Program
at the University of Colorado, said the 18-year-old program
experimented with resident graduate instructors but decided more
resident advisers were needed. The change was made not for
academics, but because students needed more supervision.
   Like the Ann Arbor program, retention rates are much higher than
in the whole university, and there are fewer students on academic
probation, he said.
   ``It's not easier. Get that out of your mind right now,'' said
Falesa Ivory, 21, a senior psychology major from Chicago who says
her Pilot grades were comparable to her other marks.
   The Pilot Program has not compiled detailed statistics on
student performance compared to the university at large. However,
co-founder Brown said the school's housing department kept track of
each unit's performance in areas such as academics, intramural
sports and vandalism during the 1960s.
   The unit the first Pilot students moved into had one of the
lowest grade-point averages and one of the highest vandalism rates.
After a few years, Pilot students were among the highest in
academics and lowest in vandalism.
   A 1981-84 study conducted showed that while minority students at
Michigan had higher dropout rates than other students, those in the
Pilot Program had an 80 percent to 95 percent retention rate. The
university at large had a 70 percent retention rate, said David
Schoem, a former director.
   In the Pilot Program, many of the courses may be used toward
general education requirements. Students may find them more
interesting because they deal with specific themes.
   Raouf Mama, resident director for academics, teaches an English
composition course focusing on human relationships as they appear
in literature.
   Jim Hartman, who is pursuing a master's degree in environmental
education, teaches a course called Planet Management, focusing on
issues like world hunger and politics. Their final exam might be to
develop a dorm program or display on a specific crisis. One group
of students discussing homelessness decided the best way to learn
about it was to hit the streets.
   Hartman, also the hall's resident director for activities, said,
``For me, the thing about learning is if you can participate and be
creative, have some power in your learning, then you have a better
chance of learning.''

   The baby boy was found at the bottom of a
motel trash bin. His face was swollen, his body still, strangled in
the first hours of life and dumped by three people who sped off in
a late-model Chevy Nova.
   ``It's such a waste of life,'' said Gardena police Detective
Bill Moreno, who is trying to trace the mother by a serial number
on the video-game box into which the infant was stuffed. ``Who
would do something like that?''
   The mother who abandons her child is often unwed, perhaps has
lost a job, is addicted to drugs or has mental or physical
problems, experts say. ``Baby blues'' _ postpartum depression _
also can play a part.
   ``I was isolated. I felt very alone. I didn't feel there was
anybody out there in the world that could possibly understand what
I was going through,'' explained Gayle Marcuerquiaga, who left a
newborn girl in a neighbor's trash.
   An estimated 20,860 children were abandoned in 1986 in the
United States, ranging from babies dumped in the trash to toddlers
left in foster homes and not reclaimed, according to the American
Humane Association.
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg because nobody keeps any
hard figures,'' said AHA spokeswoman Katie Bond. It's hard to tell
if abandonment is increasing, she said, because it represents only
1 percent of child abuse and neglect _ and those reports have
climbed 212 percent since 1976.
   But Alex Morales of the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a
private, non-profit agency which places some forsaken babies in
foster homes, said, ``There is an increase and a change in the
flavor of what's behind it. It seems to be very related to
substance abuse problems that the adults are having.''
   ``It's an act of desperation,'' said Thomas Hicklin, assistant
professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at University of
Southern California.
   Mrs. Marcuerquiaga, 28, who is appealing her attempted murder
conviction and three-year prison term, calls her Sparks, Nev.,
family typically American. She was a young mother juggling work,
family, children, and financial ruin.
   She believes abandoning her baby last April culminated a series
of events that included her father's death and a back injury that
put her husband Jim out of work. Her job as a manicurist didn't
bring in enough to support their sons, ages 8{ and 4. The couple
separated for six months, and she got pregnant during a one-night
stand. Yet she refused to believe she was pregnant until the child
was born as she sat over the toilet, and even then the child was
not real.
   ``If it were a child to me, that would not have happened,'' she
said of the abandonment. The infant was put up for adoption because
Mrs. Marcuerquiaga did not want her to grow up with knowledge of
her first few hours. ``I felt if we brought her home, she would
have to live with this, and she deserves better.''
   In some cases, children have been left where there is a
possibility someone will rescue them, such as doorsteps, churches,
hospitals.
   A newborn boy was found in March 1988 outside a Mission Viejo
urgent care center with a bag of diapers, a $20 bill and a note
saying: ``Hi, my name is Brett. Please find me a good home.''
   Last November, a woman pinned a note to the yellow sleeper of
her infant son and left him on the steps of a Roman Catholic church
here. The note, in Spanish, said: ``I have no job. I have no money.
I am from El Salvador.''
   In January, a newborn boy dressed in a T-shirt and diaper was
left on the doorstep of a home in the upscale Los Angeles suburb of
Simi Valley. ``We were just thankful that we were home,'' said
Valerie Carrillo. ``It was a shock to open up and see something so
special on the doorstep.''
   The Rev. Alberto Villalobos, who answered a bell at the door of
St. John of God Catholic Church in Norwalk, Calif., in March 1988
to find a week-old boy, said the 22-year-old unwed mother was
driven by fear. ``Nobody knew she was pregnant.''
   The baby had been left with the note: ``Please take care of my
child. Give him a good home. I can't, because I don't have one.''
   ``From what I know, she was a young person down on her luck who
did what she thought was best for the child,'' sheriff's Sgt.
Douglas Dickinson said of the decision not to file charges. The
mother was not identified.
   An abandoned child becomes a ward of the county or, in some
areas, the state. While authorities search for the parents, the
child is put in a foster home, where it might live for up to 1{
years before it can legally be adopted.
   Psychologists and social workers say most abandoned children who
are permanently adopted into good homes will not suffer any special
problems. But Hicklin said ``some children think maybe they're to
blame or something's wrong with them _ they must not be right or
worthy of their mother's love.''
   Finding parents willing to love a throwaway child is not
difficult. Most waiting lines are years long for couples who want
to adopt an infant. Each case of abandonment lights up switchboards
nationwide with would-be parents.
   ``People are clamoring for babies,'' said Ray LaMotte,
spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Children's
Services. ``They can walk in and hand the baby to us. No one needs
to know their name.''
   All the newborns abandoned in the Los Angeles area in the last
year were unclaimed by parents. With older children, mothers
sometimes do return.
   A woman who abandoned her 3-month-old daughter at a Visalia
hospital in January, saying she couldn't pay her medical bills,
later returned for the baby and was offered help by county mental
health workers.
   One of the more publicized cases is that of Christina LoCasto,
who gave birth to a daughter, Alyssa, July 13 on a United Airlines
jet bound from New York to San Francisco. An airline worker later
found the child stuffed into a bathroom waste bin, suffering from
hypothermia and cuts on her back.
   Mrs. LoCasto, 24, of Staten Island, N.Y., pleaded innocent in
July to one felony count of child endangerment. Custody of the
child has been given to her paternal grandparents, and Mrs. LoCasto
and her husband Louis, who apparently was unaware of the pregnancy,
visit six hours weekly under supervision.
   Mrs. LoCasto is in therapy while awaiting an April 13
preliminary hearing, said her attorney, Richard Bennett. If she
changes her plea to guilty, she will face no more than a year in
county jail.
   ``She doesn't want to go to jail,'' said Assistant District
Attorney Steve Wagstaff. ``But we're not going to agree to that
until we find the answer to the question: Why did she do this?''
   Sharon Elliott survived an undetermined amount of time before
being found Christmas Eve 1931 along an Arizona desert highway by a
couple changing a flat tire. Tucked inside a black pasteboard
hatbox, the tiny red-haired waif drew nationwide attention and
became known as the ``hatbox baby.''
   Ms. Elliott, 57, theorizes she was born to an unwed woman
fearful of a disapproving society, or perhaps the couple who found
her had known the mother and made up the story of finding the child
in the desert.
   She is happy to have been adopted, but there is a hard edge in
her voice when she considers throwaway kids. ``There's so many
places you can take a child. Don't just dump them like a load of
trash.''

   Fidela Pizarra thinks she might make
enough money to start rebuilding the home she lost in a typhoon.
   Helen Rodica no longer has to beg in the streets to feed her
family.
   Their new beginnings come from Marie de la Soudiere, a
Frenchwoman who barks orders _ and encoura in the
small, second-story office of Thread ofgement _ at them Hope for Economic
Advancement, or THEA.
   They are among 40 women from impoverished squatter settlements
who are making nightgowns being sold in boutiques in the United
States and a half dozen other places in the world.
   De la Soudiere brought the women together last year.
   THEA's goal is to provide a decent livelihood for destitute
women who cannot qualify for government jobs or who ``fall through
the cracks'' of state welfare and assistance programs.
   It is among hundreds of cooperatives, most supported by foreign
and local charity organizations, that provide jobs for thousands of
Filipinos who otherwise face lives of abject poverty.
   De la Soudiere, who worked with international relief
organizatioa major tax reform that is
likely to strip away some of the benefits of buying and selling
expensive artwork.
   Despite the egalitarian ideology of the Swedish welfare state,
private wealth has blossomed over the last decade, bringing new
money to old and modern art. Big companies also boost their
prestige by displaying the best of Swedish collections in their
corporate headquarters.
   All this has created a boom in the art market, and in art prices.
   ``Swedes have a lot of purchasing power right now,'' said Hans
Dyhlen, director of the Swedish branch of Sotheby's. ``Art is seen
both as an interesting and a relatively secure investment. People
buy art as a form of security planning.'' But buyers, he said,
aren't very discriminating in their taste.
   Dyhlen said the competition on the art market increased five
years ago, when a third big quality auction house, Beijers, was
established in Sweden. ``There's a lot happening on the Swedish art
scene right now. A lot of young artists have exhibitions, and get
their works sold.''
   Bukowski's auction house sold works last year worth 368 million
kronor ($61.3 million), about four times its sales in 1983.
   Goran Hellstrom, of Bukowski's information department, said
prices of high quality work have risen dramatically, and he had a
kinder view of local tastes. ``People are more quality conscious
now then five years ago,'' he said.
   Under current tax law, artwork is exempt from capital gains tax
after five years of ownership, a break that is unavailable to
sellers of stocks or real estate.
   ``I guess there have been just too many investments in art for
the sake of evading taxes,'' Sven Karldstedt, a tax official, said.
But whether or not the benefits of art ownership will be reduced in
the tax reform is a political question.
   Last November, a little-known Swedish real estate tycoon, Hans
Thulin, made a splash in the U.S. modern art world. Within one week
he bought Jasper Johns' ``White Flag'' and ``Rebus '' by Robert
Rauschenbert for a total of $13.3 million. A week later he paid
nearly $2 million at a Swedish auction for Nils Dardel's ``Dying
Dandy.''
   Although the business magazine Affarsvarlden listed Thulin among
Sweden's 100 wealthiest families, Stockholm's tabloids reported
that he declared zero wealth in his 1986 tax declaration, and paid
no income tax in 1986 or 1987.
   The average worker pays about half his salary in taxes to
underwrite social welfare benefits such as free education and
health care.
   But the high taxes also generate what Swedes call ``tax
planning,'' the search for legal or illegal ways to evade taxes.
   For the small investor, some companies advertise shares in
paintings which are stored away for selling after the five-year tax
break takes effect, said Karl-Gustav Fernlund, a member of the
governmental committee working on the tax revision.
   Fernlund said such companies were one reason why art investments
have started to attract attention.
   Hellstrom said any tax on profits in art would primarily affect
the quality auction houses and art dealers, which keep all
transactions on file, and favor less serious dealers. He also said
a tax could scare away buyers from the national market and
encourage them to invest abroad, despite a 25 percent import tax on
artwork brought into the country.
   The broadened interest in art, for whatever reason, has
benefited Swedish artists. In a country of 8.4 million, 3,200

   Nearly five decades ago, Nazis seized
valuable 200-year-old amber artworks from a Russian palace as
Soviet and German troops battled ferociously on the outskirts of
Leningrad.
   Four years later, the ``Amber Room'' treasures vanished inside
Nazi Germany in one of the world's greatest unsolved mysteries.
   And now, thriller writer Heinz G. Konsalik has retold the tale
in the best-selling novel ``Das Bernstein Zimmer'' (``The Amber
Room''), a work that combines fact with some highly imaginative
fiction.
   Since 1945, stumped Soviet officials as well as private German
treasure hunters have been looking for the collection of amber wall
panels, figures and garlands taken from the famous Catherine Palace.
   The long search has turned up dozens of clues about the fate of
the amber treasures _ from suspicions the Nazis hid the collection
inside a brewery cellar, to indications the artworks went down with
a German ship sunk by a Soviet submarine in 1945.
   Last year, an anonymous man repeatedly called East German
officials saying he knew where the collection was, but refused to
disclose the location. So far, all the guesses, rumors and even
well-researched hypotheses have led nowhere.
   In his book, Konsalik fuses the history of the Amber Room
collection with speculation about what may have happened to the
treasures.
   Parts of ``Das Bernstein Zimmer'' are wilder and more
imaginative than most rumors about the collection's ultimate fate,
and the writer himself warns not to seriously take those sections
of the book.
   In the novel, a greedy American G.I. in occupied Germany steals
the Amber Room collection, goes on a murder spree to keep it from
anyone else, transports it to the United States and four decades
later blows the whole thing up while fantasizing that he's Peter
the Great.
   Once again, in his new work, Konsalik has found all the
ingredients necessary for winning a broad readership: espionage,
intrigue, war, murder and romance.
   But the author says he thinks the main appeal of ``Das Berstein
Zimmer'' is the still unsolved question: Where is the treasured
collection? ``There is great interest in this subject because the
Amber Room remains such a mystery.'' The novel recounts the greed
of Nazi leaders who ordered that the Amber Room treasures be seized
as German troops attacked Leningrad in 1941, the futile Soviet
efforts to prevent the collection from being taken to Germany and
the artworks' disappearance in East Prussia during the chaos that
preceded Hitler's defeat.
   For two centuries, the beauty and splendor of the Amber Room
mesmerized those privileged enough to see its treasures inside the
renowned Catherine Palace in Pushkin, just outside modern-day
Leningrad. The Catherine Palace was the summer residence of
Russia's royal family.
   Ironically, the Amber Room had German origins. In 1707, under
instructions from Prussian King Friedrich Wilhelm I, German and
Danish artists created decorative panels of brilliant amber for the
Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin.
   Peter the Great fell under the amber collection's spell during a
visit to Berlin, and Friedrich Wilhelm decided to give it to the
Russian czar to help secure the friendship of a valuable ally,
according to historical accounts.
   The collection was loaded aboard sleds and transported in the
winter of 1716-17 to Petersburg, which is now known as Leningrad.
The panels and other amber treasures were later installed in a room
inside the Catherine Palace.
   In 1941, as German and Soviet troops fought savagely on the
outskirts of Leningrad, a special German team removed the
collection from the Catherine Palace and transported it safely to
the East Prussian city of Koenigsberg where it was placed in a
museum. Four years later, the Soviets had turned the tables and
were defeating German troops within the Third Reich. Nazi leaders
had the Amber Room collection packed up and ready for transport to
keep the artworks out of Soviet hands. But from that point on,
there are only traces of what happened to the treasures.
   Konsalik thinks the Amber Room collection has been lost for
good. ``There are many trails leading to various places, but I
don't believe it will ever be recovered.''
   More than 91,000 hardcover copies of Konsalik's ``Das Bernstein
Zimmer'' have been sold since the book appeared in print earlier
this year, according to his publisher, Hestia Verlag.
   His work is often ignored by West Germany's highly demanding
book critics, who concede his popularity but question the literary
quality of novels. But he has written 122 works, and his books have
been translated into 26 languages. He has sold an estimated 72
million copies of his books worldwide.
   With that kind of popularity, Konsalik has no trouble shaking
off suggestions that he is not a ``serious'' writer.
   ``These people are far more important to me than a dozen or so
critics,'' he said about those who buy his books.

   Spring came gently this year to Gallaudet
University, with no outward sign of the tumult that catapulted the
nation's only university for the deaf to international prominence
and led to the naming of its first deaf president.
   But a year later, the spirit of the ``Deaf President Now''
protest lives on _ in newfound pride and assertiveness among the
deaf, in heightened awareness and understanding among the hearing.
   ``The euphoria is still here. The energy is still here,'' said
I. King Jordan, Gallaudet's president. ``The sense of purpose, the
sense of community _ it's better than it was ever before. It gets
better all the time. Something fundamental has changed in the
beliefs that deaf people have about themselves and that hearing
people have about deaf people.''
   Jordan won his post March 13, 1988, after students, joined by
faculty, staff and alumni, shut down the 125-year-old school for
five days and forced the board of trustees' initial choice to
resign. She was Elisabeth Ann Zinser, a hearing woman who did not
know sign language; she was gone within a week.
   Lofty pronouncements emanated by the dozens from protesters
riding the exhilarating crest of victory last spring. ``God made
the world in seven days and we have changed it in seven days,''
deaf chemistry professor Charles Giansanti said then. Nothing will
ever be the same, said countless others.
   Visionaries or fools? The developments of the past year point to
the former.
   Enrollment at the 2,400-student university is up 52 percent.
Congress, which provides most of the Gallaudet budget, boosted its
contribution 6.2 percent. The two congressmen on the Gallaudet
board are learning to sign. The new deaf chairman of the board
developed a plan to recruit deaf board members. Jordan, in constant
demand to speak, has become an inspirational symbol revered by deaf
people all over the country.
   Perhaps the most fundamental change is a shift in attitude.
   ``People have developed a lot more confidence in themselves,''
said Greg Hlibok, student body president and part of the intense
quartet that led the insurgency. ``Their pride has increased. Their
view of the future _ they look forward to much more than people did
five years ago. There's a wider range of perspective.''
   Off campus, the story is similar. ``More people are aware of
deafness,'' Hlibok said through an interpreter. ``Before, they
looked at us as a problem. Today, they look at us as people with a
problem _ deafness. That's all.''
   The board chairman, IBM executive Philip Bravin, said
Gallaudet's week in the limelight was enough to propel much of the
private sector from discomfort to openness toward the deaf.
   Referring to his and Jordan's speaking engagements around the
country, Bravin, who also won his job as a result of the
insurgency, said that ``countless times we have run into people
saying that their job or working conditions changed for the better
overnight as a result of DPN (the Deaf President Now movement).
That's a very positive thing to hear. It's not limited (to a few
corporations) but (is) very global.''
   Again and again, one is told of students landing jobs they were
never able to get before _ whether because of their own insecurity
or an employer's intolerance.
   One girl, told that a pizza delivery job had been filled, passed
by the store next day and saw the ``help wanted'' sign again in the
window. She confronted the supervisor and got the job. ``She felt
that empowerment that a year ago she might not have felt,'' said
Jordan.
   Since the protest, students have ``a general attitude of `I can
win, I can succeed, I can achieve what I want,''' said career
center director Sue Pressman. At the same time, she said, employers
have become more receptive to hiring deaf graduates and many more
companies are participating in Gallaudet career fairs.
   ``You do still find a lot of attitudinal barriers,'' she said.
``But the deaf protest allowed us to go in and work with those
people. Employers are looking to Gallaudet for the answers. They're
willing (to hire deaf people). They want us to help them. They're
looking to us to show them the way.''
   The same heightened interest is evident in Gallaudet's
internship program, which has expanded rapidly since the protest.
``The one big thing is (that) we have name recognition now. We
never had that before with private companies, and it's an important
entree,'' said program director Anne Nissen.
   Nissen said she used to have to give a long explanation of
Gallaudet, often with little to show for it.
   ``People were always courteous, because you're not rude to
people who are explaining a disability, but they didn't follow
up,'' she said. ``Now there's a lot of curiosity and eagerness to
be attached to a famous place. We have milked that.''
   New participants in the internship program include Sears,
Roebuck and Co.; Saks Fifth Avenue; Northern Telecom; MCI
Communications Corp.; AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, and several Big Eight
accounting firms. Students are doing more challenging work, Nissen
said, and are more likely to complain promptly if a job turns out
to be busywork.
   Students say they're being treated better not only on the job
but in other aspects of daily life as well. ``When I used to go to
a restaurant and ask for paper and pen to order some food, people
tended to have a negative attitude,'' said Hlibok. ``Now there's a
willingness. They're eager to help.''
   The other big change, the four protest leaders said through an
interpreter, is that the nation's deaf community no longer sits on
its hands when its interests are at stake. ``This was our first
movement,'' said Jerry Covell. ``Deaf people now feel that we're
entitled to our opinion.''
   Tim Rarus recalled his doubts in organizing a Capitol Hill rally
to demand telecommunications devices for the deaf on phones at
federal agencies. ``I thought, deaf people aren't going to show
up,'' he said. ``But they did. We got a good crowd.''
   Hlibok said another successful rally was held in New York to
protest threatened budget cuts for state schools for the deaf.
``There's an unwritten rule since the protest'' at Gallaudet.
``When something happens that's a crisis in the deaf community,
deaf people are going to act,'' he said.
   ``That didn't happen before the protest. We asked ourselves,
`Should we or shouldn't we?' But, now, if something's wrong, we're
going to speak out right away.''
   Hlibok, Rarus, Covell and Bridgetta Bourne all said they plan to
attend law school in the next few years and serve the deaf or
disabled community in some fashion. They are acutely conscious of
their legacy _ not only to the school, but to the larger deaf
community as well.
   ``We made history,'' Covell said simply. ``Now small deaf
children will look to that and will learn something from it. We
were oppressed and finally we said, `Enough.' They will do better
than we did. They'll continue what we haven't finished.''

   Ordinary people, extraordinary paintings.
   Call Thomas Hart Benton a failed artist as one critic does.
Quibble over whether regionalism was a legitimate movement in
American art history. Accuse him of betraying himself by turning
away from fashionable modernism to paint realistically.
   But because his paintings about everyday people appeal to
everyday people does not mean they are unsophisticated, says Henry
Adams, curator of American Art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art.
The paintings _ his murals especially _ are bold, colorful and
dramatic. They have, as Adams says, the tendency to pop off the
wall.
   April 15 marks the 100th anniversary of Benton's birth. Were he
still alive, the artist could celebrate with his fans at Kelly's, a
popular saloon and the kind of place where Benton would be pleased
to have his pictures hang. An afternoon bourbon party is held each
Sunday in his honor.
   Or he could attend the opening of the first major exhibition of
his work since his death. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art will
display 90 of his paintings beginning April 16.
   Benton spent much of his life among the intellectual and
creative in the world's most exciting cities. His home was once a
gathering place for such luminaries as the poet Carl Sandburg, and
folk singers Burl Ives and Pete Seeger, a place where bourbon oiled
conversation and Rita Benton set a memorable table.
   He was happiest, though, trudging across the South and the
Southwest, sketching farmhands, saloon girls and factory workers.
   ``I like people and primarily I paint for them,'' the artist
said at the height of his acclaim in 1936. ``If they can see
something in these paintings out of their own lives, I don't care
what they think or know about art.''
   The exhibition, the first traveling show staged by the Nelson,
will close June 18 in Kansas City and open Aug. 4 at the Detroit
Institute of Arts, Nov. 17 at the Whitney Museum of American Art in
New York and April 29, 1990, at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art.
   By necessity, the show's organizers ignored the irony of putting
Benton's work in a museum. Museums, the artist once said, are
graveyards generally run ``by a pretty boy with delicate wrists and
a swing in his gait.''
   That 1941 diatribe to reporters in New York _ which got worse _
also included some thinly veiled criticisms of figures at the
Nelson. It made all the papers, and Benton was fired from his
teaching job at the Kansas City Art Institute. And by 1948, he was
excluded from a list of the 10 best American painters drawn up by
Life magazine.
   ``You are constantly trying to figure out whether he was a fool
or a genius. The answer is, of course, he was both,'' says Adams,
whose Benton biography will be published as the exhibition opens.
   Benton loved bourbon and books, Rita, his harmonica and family
musicales, bourbon, ordinary Ozarks folk, telling stories, stirring
up things, locomotives and bourbon; but most of all he loved to
paint.
   Paint he did until the day he died, every day in the studio out
back, usually 10 hours a day.
   Rita found him dead of a heart attack in front of his last
mural. It was for the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville which
had upset him because he had not quite got the Wabash Cannonball
right. He was 85, and had just finished the work that afternoon _
Jan. 18, 1975. His wife died three months later. She couldn't live
without him, their daughter, Jessie, said.
   ``He got up every morning excited about life and eager to go to
work,'' Adams said. ``This was someone always very alive, always
very excited about the next project. There was an intensity in the
way this man lived. They had a way of making things that seem
ordinary to us, the moon or a dead tree stump, seem like something
special.''
   Time Magazine put him on the cover Dec. 24, 1934, calling him
one of the leaders in a new movement in American art called
Regionalism.
   Benton accepted the label _ in some ways it was a gimmick, Adams
says _ and declared himself free of modernist and abstract
directions artists in New York were taking. That, his detrators
say, was bad.
   Benton showed promise in the 1920s when he experimented with
abstraction, but betrayed himself by abandoning it, said critics
Clement Greenberg and Hilton Kramer.
   ``The person whom we are celebrating here today, in my view, was
a failed artist,'' said Kramer, editor of The New Criterion in New
York.
   Kramer said that art should be judged for its aesthetic
qualities, not its cultural themes. Benton fails when judged
aesthetically, he said.
   ``Now in the 1980s, we are celebrating the second coming of
Thomas Hart Benton,'' Kramer said. ``He is being seen as a very
model of success. But, in my view, this won't succeed. I find it
mostly myth that he was a great American artist who somehow gave
American art its quintessential essense.''
   The tumult of the times in which he lived influenced Benton's
painting. A time of great political, social and economic change
yielded themes of growing industry, of injustice and of the
agrarian, rural life that was being left behind.
   Criticism of Benton's painting, then, often had to do with his
subjects. He was at times labeled a fascist and a communist, a
racist and anti-Semitic. However, he was most likely a New Deal,
liberal Democrat, according to Adams.
   ``His role as a painter was to make the invisible visible. There
is always a message to what Benton is doing, usually an ambiguous
one. He didn't want people to look at a painting and come away
feeling smug because they knew what he meant,'' Adams says.
   Benton's greatest works were murals painted for the states of
Indiana and Missouri. The Indiana mural was commissioned for the
World's Fair in 1933 and now hangs at Indiana University. The
Missouri mural, finished in 1936, is in the House Lounge in the
Capitol at Jefferson City.
   Shortly before he died, Benton said, ``If I have any right to
make judgments, I would say that the Missouri mural was my best
work.''
   ``A Social History of Missouri'' took 18 months to plan and six
months to paint.
   Benton, who stood only 5-foot-2, was quick with his fists as a
boy in rough-and-tumble Neosho, Mo., and quick with his wits later
in life. Self-taught mostly in things other than art, he had ``a
Renaissance range of interests,'' Adams said.
   ``I have run into my father's critics all my life,'' said Jessie
Benton. ``But also I've run into people who adore the paintings in
a mystical way, even more then I do.
   ``I think people should remember him as a man who put life into
art. And art into life.''

   The ``bad old days'' before abortion was
legalized were not so bad, say anti-abortion advocates who contend
women's lives would not be imperiled if abortion should be outlawed
once again.
   They argue that better antibiotics, intensive care units and
surgical techniques were already halting the serious bleeding,
infections and other complications of illegal abortions before the
U.S. Supreme Court overturned state bans on abortions in 1973.
   ``Legalization of abortion in the United States apparently did
not save a single woman's life,'' asserted Dr. John Willke of
Cincinnati, president of the National Right to Life Committee.
   He contends that before 1973 there were not many illegal
abortions and says that very few women died from abortions.
   Federal health officials agree that statistics show the death
rate from complications of illegal abortions was declining before
1973.
   But supporters of women's right to abortion dispute that a
renewed ban on abortions would not have serious health
consequences. They note there are no statistics on the number of
women who suffered non-fatal health problems from illegal abortions.
   The debate over abortion is intensifying as the Supreme Court
prepares to hear arguments April 26 over Missouri regulations that
restrict the availability of abortions. Both sides expect the court
to use the case to reexamine the landmark Roe vs. Wade decision
that legalized abortions in 1973.
   Opponents of Roe-Wade, including the Bush administration, are
asking the court to declare there is no constitutional right to
abortion and return to the states the power to restrict or outlaw
abortions.
   In a telephone interview, Willke said ``nobody has the slightest
idea'' how many illegal abortions took place before 1973.
   However, he said, the number of abortion-related deaths was more
concrete because ``a perforated uterus _ which is evident on
autopsy _ a massive infection, a hemorrhage ... (make it) pretty
obvious what has happened.''
   Willke said that in the 1950s, an average of 250 women a year
were reported to have died in the United States due to illegal
abortions. But by 1966, while abortion was still illegal
everywhere, the annual number of reported deaths had dropped to 128.
   In 1972, the year before Roe-Wade, 5 million pregnancies and 39
abortion-related deaths were reported.
   After 1973, when the ban ended in all states, ``illegal abortion
presumably disappeared,'' Willke said. ``If, in fact, the
elimination of illegal abortion eliminated back alleys, there
should have been a perceptible drop in the number of women dying.
That didn't happen. The line didn't even blip from 1967 to 1973 and
1974. ... It just kept going down at the same slow rate. There was
no evidence of a decline in mortality from legalization.''
   Dr. Hami Atrash, acting chief of pregnancy epidemiology at the
federal Centers for Disease Control, said, ``The trend has been
going down since 1940, just like for any other cause of death.''
   The CDC did not begin keeping thorough records on
abortion-related deaths until 1972. It has two sets of slightly
inconsistent figures covering some years before 1972 that
essentially back up the anti-abortion group's figures.
   Sandy Smith, a spokeswoman for the CDC's National Center for
Health Statistics, said it was possible some doctors falsified
death certificates to protect victims of illegal abortions.
   ``There's no way to know,'' said Atrash. ``Even today, some
people say women die of abortions and they're not reported.''
   The CDC also does not have figures on how many women suffered
severe bleeding, infections, hysterectomies and other complications
from abortions but survived.
   David Andrews, acting president of the Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, said statistics from the time ``are not
terribly reliable because it was an illegal procedure and nobody
kept count.''
   ``But people who lived through that period know that women were
dying, women were maimed, many women lost their fertility'' due to
botched abortions, Andrews said.
   Willke predicted that if abortion should become illegal again,
about 100,000 women a year would have the procedure anyway.
   An estimated 1.5 million abortions have been performed annually
since 1973.
   ``I do know that this time around, illegal abortions will be
considerably safer than they were,'' Willke said. ``People who do
them have had a great deal of experience.''
   Andrews disagreed.
   ``Doctors who are capable of providing the service ... would not
risk their professional careers,'' he said. ``What you would get
would be inadequately trained, back-alley practitioners _ probably
people who are not doctors _ who simply have as their goal the
exploitation of women.''
   Willke says the best ways to address the problem of unwanted
pregnancies would be to grant tax incentives for adoption and place
non-white children with white adoptive parents.
   He contends a significant percentage of all abortions are
``birth control abortions.''
   ``People know they have this backstop so they take chances,'' he
said. ``... When you can't get abortions, you're more careful _ or
you don't do it (have sex).''

   Women seeking alternatives to ``back alley''
abortions found a scattering of oases even before the U.S. Supreme
Court legalized abortions 16 years ago.
   Most of the attention focused on New York, which quickly became
a mecca for women who wanted to end their pregnancies after the
Legislature erased a ban on abortions in 1970.
   New York wasn't the first state to ease abortion restrictions,
but it was the only one that did not limit abortions to state
residents and it was one of only three that did not require the
consent of a parent or spouse.
   Women seeking abortions began flooding into the state.
   The first legal abortion in the state was performed July 1,
1970, and by the time the Supreme Court made abortions legal
nationwide on Jan. 22, 1973, nearly 400,000 women had traveled to
New York to terminate pregnancies.
   They found clean facilities, counseling and a matter-of-fact
candor that contrasted sharply with the shadowy world of illegal
abortions.
   Abortion clinic staff members, some sporting pink carnations in
their lapels for easy recognition, met flights at airports and
escorted patients into vans or limousines.
   The Alan Guttmacher Institute says legal abortions were
performed for 48,000 women from other states in 1970, 155,000 in
1971, 172,000 in 1972 and 84,000 in 1973. New York residents had
41,000 abortions in 1970, 101,000 in 1971, 110,000 in 1972 and
120,000 in 1973.
   The rush tapered off after the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade
decision. But supporters of the right to an abortion fear the
current court may reconsider that ruling when it hears arguments in
a case involving Missouri abortion rules April 26.
   About 80 clinics and hospitals were licensed to perform
abortions in New York City. Each year, they aborted as many
pregnancies as there were live births in the city, said Jean
Pakter, who was director of the health department's Bureau of
Maternity Services and Family Planning.
   Polly Rothstein, director and co-founder of the Westchester
Coalition for Legalized Abortion, recalled limousines from posh,
private clinics ``meeting patients at airports and bringing them to
abortion clinics in New York, for no questions asked, safe
abortions.''
   A visit to one such clinic as an observer in 1972 ``was an
eye-opener for me,'' she said.
   ``It was a blessing _ just a blessing for people to have it done
by a doctor in a sterile clinic. Breaking the law, the sneaking
around, the anxiety attached to it _ `Will I get it? Will I get
it?' _ was removed,'' she said.
   ``We were seeing women coming from all over the country,'' said
Libby Antarsh, then director of the Eastern Women's Center. ``Many
of the women who came _ really, there were a lot of young girls _
had never been to New York. Some had never flown or been out of
their small towns. They were terrified.
   ``The waiting room was enormous, but on Saturdays not an inch of
floor space was visible,'' she said. ``The patients and visitors,
mostly jeaned, smoking, young, scared, blond, from (states like)
Ohio, were everywhere.''
   The center provided abortions seven days a week, with a sliding
fee scale that topped at $150, and ran a free van service to and
from LaGuardia Airport.
   ``There was a counselor on board as well as a driver. We would
meet the flights, try to calm them down, talk to them about what
they might expect for the day,'' said Ms. Antarsh. ``You can
imagine the tension and feelings of those young women.''
   The patients went home the same day, she said. ``It was easier
for young women to have an unexplained absence for (just) a day. On
a Saturday, they could fly in the morning, come home at night and
no one would know about it.''
   New York City designated Planned Parenthood's family planning
hotline as an official abortion information number. It was posted
on bulletin boards of college campuses and social work agencies
around the country.
   ``We sat down at these phones and they never stopped ringing,''
said Marcia Lawrence, director of communications for Planned
Parenthood of New York City. ``There was never a point during the
day when all five buttons were not lit. They were calling from
everywhere, every state in the union.
   ``We always tried to give the woman the strength to truly see
clearly what it was she honestly wanted to do. That was our job as
we saw it, not to push her in either direction,'' she said.
   ``But when someone has hitchhiked from Nebraska to New York, you
cannot really say, `Are you sure you really want this abortion?'
She has clearly indicated that she wants it.''
   Teen-agers were told to ask a trusted adult to call Planned
Parenthood, help them arrange transportation and ensure adequate
medical follow-up.
   The flood lasted into the first few months of 1973, until other
states responded fully to the Supreme Court's ruling.
   It was, said Ms. Lawrence of Planned Parenthood, ``as though
heaven had opened up and said, `You have a second chance to make
everything right and get it back to where it was before.' ... It
made an enormous difference not to be made to feel like a criminal
when they were trying to make a moral choice in the best, fullest
sense.''

<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mile and a half from the White House, on a
glorious spring morning, a young man astride an expensive bicycle
has staked out a corner in an open air drug market, awaiting the
day's trade.
   The mayor, making his rounds, encounters questions about drugs
and murders wherever he goes; a meeting with the black press turns
rough.
   In a Washington courtroom, defendants in phosphorescent orange
jumpsuits, the shoestrings removed from their shoes, shuffle before
a judge.
   But also in the newly-dubbed ``murder capital'' _ 358,300 yellow
daffodils bob in the breeze, nannies push strollers along the
streets, residents marvel about the rising value of their homes _
and worry about the gypsy moth.
   During two days last week, AP reporters were dispatched to
different quarters _ far different, though not far apart _ to
observe life in the city in the spring of its travail.
   Here are their reports:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>At the Drug Market on a Sunny Morning</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   It is 9:20 a.m., the end of the morning rush hour on a glorious
spring day, and the drug markets in one of the District of
Columbia's toughest neighborhoods are open for business. A few
blocks away, cars stream down Massachusetts Avenue, carrying
lawyers, lobbyists, consultants to work.
   Here, a young man astride an expensive 10-speed bicycle has
staked out a corner. The light changes to green, but he stays put.
It changes again; he remains in place. A nonverbal offer from a
driver to let him cross the street is waved off.
   This is the Columbia Heights section of town, which a study has
identified as the most murderous in the most murderous city in the
nation.
   A survey of 714 killings during a 42-month period found that
this section _ bounded by 14th, 16th and Harvard streets and
Florida Avenue Northwest _ had more slayings, 21, than any other
census tract in the city.
   At the nearby Spanish Embassy, employees are afraid to walk
alone to their cars at night. The White House is 1{ miles away.
   Not much going on here: Just guys hanging out, no school, no
jobs.
   But there is unusual attention to a car driving slowly by, an
expectant look, a look indicating that business might be done.
   There's a fair amount of shaking of hands, a normal, friendly
gesture that could also be a drug deal consumated.

<HEAD>`It Is a Frightful Thing to See All This'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The doctors and technicians at the Washington Hospital Center's
``MedStar'' cluster get one minute's alert that a gunshot victim is
on the way.
   Other emergency rooms, including a separate one in the same
hospital, handle more routine cases. Medstar is for when it's bad.
   At 7:15 p.m., a young man picked up in one of the city's drug
corridors is wheeled in from an ambulance. He's got a bunch of
bullet holes and no blood pressure.
   The bottoms of his feet are turning yellow.
   At a speed that must be possible only because the team has done
this so many times, the man's clothes are cut off and he is hooked
up to life supports and fluids are pumped in. The doctor carves a
long gash across the left side of his chest and uses a metal device
to pry it open for heart massage.
   With youth on his side, blood pressure returns and his heart, in
plain sight, is beating strongly. Seasoned observers give him a 5
to 10 percent chance. Within 25 minutes, he's out of Medstar and in
the operating room.
   The Easter weekend had been quiet, and as they cleaned up the
Medstar crew speculated on the quick re-emergence of violence.
   ``The warm weather brings all this out,'' said paramedic Mary
Ann Melville. ``Brings them out on the street. A little aggravation
... Bang, Bang.''
   A homicide detective arrived with the patient, and the nurses
track him down. Some blood-moistened undershorts have a bullet hole
in them, and might be needed as evidence.
   ``When we cut their clothes off, we try not to cut through the
bullet holes,'' says Diane Pickel, a nurse on Medstar's two
helicopters.
   Some of the paramedics speaking among themselves. Their
discussion reveals how weary they are of all the shootings.
   Steve Chappell, a flight paramedic handling the ambulance and
helicopter communications on this night, says he can no longer
count on a ``down time.''
   The shootings ``used to be a nocturnal disease,'' he said. But
now, ``It's night and day. Trauma doesn't tell time anymore.''
   Rev. Jesse Mayes, of the Van Buren United Methodist Church,
rotates the overnight shift with other community clergy. ``It's a
frightful thing to see all of this,'' said Mayes, who comforts the
families as best he can.
   The attending physician, Dr. Mario Golocovsky, is back in
Medstar by about 8:15. How did the fellow make out when he went
upstairs?
   ``He didn't,'' Golocovsky said.
   The police identify the victim as Kevin Harden, 20, shot in an
alleyway with a semi-automatic.
   Clean-up work is interrupted by a family's wailing, heard
through the automatic double-doors. Members of the young man's
family have gathered on the ambulance ramp, and the chaplain must
be summoned to help comfort them _ elsewhere.
   Shortly after 10 p.m., another 20-year-old man arrives with
gunshot wounds to his chest.

<HEAD>A Day with the Mayor: The Subject Never Goes Away</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For Mayor Marion Barry Jr., the questions these days are the
same, whether he's talking to white businessmen or black reporters.
What is he doing about the murders? And does he count drug dealers
among his friends?
   As Barry, the first militant black civil rights leader to be
elected mayor of a major American city, struggles to deal with the
crisis in Washington, an undercurrent of rumors about his own
alleged drug use undercut his credibility.
   While speaking at the Capitol Press Club, Barry faced the same
kind of questions from the group's mostly-black press corps that he
complains the ``white media'' concentrate on.
   ``Mr. Mayor, if you had it to do over again, what mistakes would
you acknowledge?'' asked Ethel Payne, who has worked for 30 years
as a political columnist for the weekly Washington Afro-American.
   After refusing to admit having made any errors, Barry asked
Payne for her opinion of him.
   ``I think you have a whole pile of stuff to contend with.''
   Barry smiled uneasily; an uncomfortable silence settled over the
room.
   Barry is under federal investigation for his ties to a drug
suspect, Charles Lewis. Last December, city police abruptly called
off an attempted undercover drug buy from Lewis, a former city
employee. Barry was in Lewis' hotel room at the time and had been
there often. Subsequently, Lewis was arrested in the Virgin Islands
on charges he attempted to sell crack cocaine to undercover FBI
agents.
   Barry has vehemently denied ever using drugs. He said he never
saw Lewis use drugs.
   ``The media is mixing up two scandals, the drug problem and all
these things about me,'' he told the Capitol Press Club.
   Earlier, a weary Barry tried to lecture on drugs at a school in
the Shaw neighborhood, one of Washington's most depressed
communities.

   The youths figeted and talked among themselves. But they wer
held spellbound by the next speaker, Glen Harris, a local radio
personality, who railed against drug use.
   ``Glen sounded like he cared a little bit more about us,'' said
11-year-old Umi Brown. ``He sounded more sincere.''
   Barry began his day at a fence-mending session with a prominent
local business group whose members, including many past political
supporters, have become increasingly nervous about the city's crime
wave.
   While Barry stood by his side, William Sinclain, president of
the Greater Washington Board of Trade, discussed a board resolution
that criticized Barry for his inability to control crime.
   Barry maintains he is not letting any of these negatives get him
down.
   ``My spirit is strong, my vision is clear,'' he told the black
reporters' group.

<HEAD>The Police Chief: `I don`t Know What We're Going to Do!'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The view of the police chief: ``Washington, D.C. is a safe city.
It has a lower crime rate than 16 cities of comparable size.''
   ``Those murders,'' says Chief Maurice Turner, referring to the
record number of homicides in Washington, ``are occurring between
the people who use drugs, who buy drugs, who sell drugs, who abuse
drugs.''
   He made those comments during a taping for public television
station WETA. Deluged with press questions later, Turner conceded
that, despite 4,300 arrests last year, his department has been
unable to curb drug-related violence and may have to wait out the
bloody turf wars.
   ``I don't know what the hell we're going to do!'' he exclaimed.
   ``Miami went through this experience. Detroit went through this
experience. We're no different than any other community,'' said
Turner.
   But police and criminologists in those cities say the district's
drug battles are far deadlier.
   ``Eventually, the turf will be divided,'' predicted Turner.
``They (the prevailing dealers) will go out and sell their drugs.
People will pay their drug bills on time. And we're not going to
have all of these shootings we have now.''
   In the meantime, he said, the community must work together to
reinforce strong values in young people.
   School board member Calvin Lockridge and local magazine
publisher Bill Regardie have charged that Mayor Barry has used
drugs. About that, Turner says this: ``I've never asked the mayor,
has he used drugs. I've never had any evidence that the mayor uses
drugs. If I ever saw the mayor with drugs, he would be arrested.''

<HEAD>Shuffling to the Bench, in Laceless Shoes and Glowing Jumpsuits</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Judge Ricardo Urbina looked sternly down at Gilbert Spencer.
``The stuff you gave to the man on the corner for your friend _ you
knew that was cocaine?'' he asked.
   ``Yes,'' Spencer replied.
   A routine morning in D.C. Superior Court. The charge: attempt to
distribute cocaine. The plea: guilty.
   ``Your honor,'' Spencer's attorney began. Spencer is 53, she
said. His prior offenses were minor. He had been a window cleaner
for 34 years.
   The prosecuting attorney demurred; Spencer had a number of prior
arrests, two prior drug convictions and had said he didn't think he
had an addiction problem.
   Did Mr. Spencer care to speak? ``I don't know too much about
courts,'' he said. ``I have a 15-year-old daughter. She has nobody
to direct her. ... I know I did wrong.''
   Urbina barely paused before issuing sentence. Twenty to 60
months in jail, all but seven months suspended. Three years of
probation, contingent on full-time employment and extensive drug
testing _ once a week for the first year, twice a month for the
second and at the discretion of the probation officer for the third.
   ``Good Luck,'' said the judge.
   ``Thank you, sir.''
   Next.
   David Ray, dressed from head to toe in the phosphorescent orange
jumpsuit issued by the D.C. jail, was charged with probation
violations.
   ``Your honor,'' Ray's attorney began. It's true Ray missed
appointments and urine tests. But he had moved and was receiving
mail late, and he had been hospitalized several times after being
pushed out a third floor window.
   ``He assures me, your honor ... that he is drug-free at this
point. In light of the circumstances, I simply ask you to allow him
to continue on probation,'' the attorney said.
   ``I think we need more evidence,'' Urbina says. The hearing was
rescheduled until hospital records and the probation officer could
be present.
   Three flights down, those locked up over the Easter weekend
filed three-by-three into the basement arraignment chamber.
   A fierce-looking young man with a bandage nearly covering his
eye was released, contingent on drug screening and avoiding certain
company.
   ``Stay away from Miss Stubbs,'' warned hearing commissioner Paul
Buxbaum. ``If you have anything to do with her, even a phone call
to her place, I'll lock you up.''
   Defendant after defendant shuffled up to the judge.
   ``No paper, the government drops the charges,'' the clerk said
over and over.
   ``Thank God,'' a woman in a red down coat breathed as she filed
out of the room.

<HEAD>A Slow Night with an Ambulance Crew</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The man in a red University of Maryland sweatshirt and black
knit cap covering his dreadlocks sat dazed on the curb in front of
a pizza outlet. Dozens of onlookers, police and ambulance workers
scurried around him.
   ``The mother------ shot me,'' he muttered over and over.
   ``Where were you shot?'' asked a paramedic after a cursory check
revealed little.
   ``In my arm,'' said the man, finally indicating that it was his
upper right arm.
   Paramedic Joseph Housley of Medic 1 sliced off the man's sleeve
and he and fellow paramedic Paul Bullock found the bullet hole.
There was no exit wound, so they knew the bullet was somewhere
inside.
   They strapped him onto a board and hoisted him into the
ambulance.
   As Bullock prepared to insert an intravenous feeding to keep up
his blood pressure, Housley put a stethoscope to his chest, trying
to determine what internal damage had been caused.
   The man, whose gnarled hands and numerous scars indicated he'd
seen lots of rough times in his 34 years _ although he said he'd
``only got shot once'' before _ wasn't in the mood to cooperate. He
kept talking when Housley ordered that he only breathe.
   He admitted that he'd had ``lots of beers,'' but balked at
Housley's questions on drugs, questions that could determine what
kind of medical treatment was called for.
   ``Look, I'm not the cops,'' Housley cajoled quietly. ``I'm not
going to turn you in.''
   He turned up the heat. ``I need to know if you do drugs, ever,
anything. Ever smoke pot? Do horse? Play with needles? Do any
Ecstacy?''
   The man denied all.
   Another ambulance worker discovered rolling papers in the man's
pocket.
   ``If you don't smoke pot, what are you doing with all these
papers in your pocket?'' Housley asked, smiling ruefully and
shaking his head.
   ``Just to have,'' the man replied.
   ``Just to have,'' Housley echoed quietly.

   Fishermen mobilized to protect untainted
beaches and estuaries from the nation's worst oil spill as the Port
of Valdez reopened to tankers lined up to load North Slope crude
oil.
   Cleanup officials said they had abandoned hope of controlling
the spill with mechanical skimmers or chemical dispersants and
planned instead to rely on burning the oil, which formed a long,
black bruise on the brilliant blue waters of Prince William Sound.
   President Bush said at the White House that the federal
government would consider taking over the cleanup from Exxon Corp.,
owner of the damaged tanker that spilled the crude, and he sent
three top officials to Alaska ``to take a hard look at where this

Corp.'s truck-trailer and maritime businesses for $232.5 million,
the two companies said.
   Fruehauf said Tuesday it will sell the trailer business, two
shipping dry docks in Florida and one in Maryland and its 80
percent interest in CEMCO, a maker of ship loading cranes, to FRH
Acquisition.

<HEAD>Sources: Milken Indictment May Precede SEC Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is close to indicting Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. bond financier Michael Milken and several
other employees of the investment firm on securities fraud charges,
sources say.
   Prosecutors have told lawyers for Milken and others their
clients could be indicted this week, before civil fraud charges
against the investment firm are settled, the sources said Tuesday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The long-awaited criminal indictment of the high-yield, or
``junk,'' bond wizard would mark a major change of the government's
strategy in its more than two-year investigation of the Wall Street
giant.
   Defense attorneys had expected the indictment to follow a
settlement between Drexel and the Securities and Exchange
Commission of civil fraud charges, including insider trading,
brought last year. The complaint names Drexel; Milken; his brother,
Lowell; two other Drexel employees; and industrialist Victor Posner
and his son, Steven.
   But with negotiations stalled, Drexel balking at
government-ordered sanctions and the Milkens mounting legal
challenges to the firm's proposed settlement, the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office reportedly has decided to proceed with the case.
   Sources close to the situation said lawyers were told that the
Milkens and at least two other Drexel employees would be indicted
this week. The sources cautioned that prosecutors had made similar
statements in the past about pending indictments that never
materialized.
   ``A number of the attorneys have been told that it's going to be
this week,'' said an attorney for one of the targets.
   The sources said the government continues to call witnesses
before a federal grand jury investigating Drexel's activities.
   Milken last year received a target letter from the government
indicating he would be indicted. The charges are expected to
parallel the 184-page SEC complaint, which detailed 21 alleged
fraud schemes between 1984 and late 1986.
   Many of the charges detail alleged wrongdoing between Milken and
Ivan Boesky, the now-jailed financier who paid $100 million to
settle insider trading charges and tipped off prosecutors to other
alleged fraud deals.
   The SEC settlement is a crucial pre-condition to a criminal plea
bargain in which Drexel is to plead guilty to six felonies and pay
the government $650 million. Drexel agreed to the pact in December
to avoid racketeering charges that could have crippled the firm.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce Baird, who heads the office's
securities fraud division, declined to comment on the Milken case.
Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the company would not discuss
negotiations in progress. A public relations firm hired by Milken
declined to comment.
   Once Milken is indicted, the government would have 70 days to
bring its case to trial unless a judge grants a delay or attorneys
file motions further stalling the case.
   One attorney said the government has indicated it would bring a
second wave of superceding indictments, contending that a first set
of charges would be used as a pressure tactic to induce Milken and
other defendants and witnesses to negotiate.
   An indictment also would shift focus from the SEC negotiations,
in which Drexel has accused the government of requesting unfairly
stringent measures against the firm and Milken.
   Negotiations reportedly stalled earlier this month when Drexel
Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph balked at a government demand
to fire Milken before the settlement is completed.
   Drexel already has agreed to fire Milken and withhold his
multimillion-dollar 1988 pay as part of the criminal settlement.
Milken is challenging the provision in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan, saying it violates his rights.

   As the paralyzing strike against Eastern
Airlines dragged through its fourth week and directors of its
parent Texas Air Corp. prepared to meet again today, there was
speculation that Eastern's future could be decided imminently.
   The board of directors of Trans World Airlines Inc., meanwhile,
met Tuesday amid mounting expectations that its owner and chairman,
Carl C. Icahn, could be poised to put a long-awaited bid for
Eastern on the table.
   And there were indications that another group, led by outgoing
Baseball Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, was outlining proposals
to buy Miami-based Eastern, which has been in bankruptcy protection
from creditors since March 9.
   The Ueberroth offer, to be financed by Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., would be for $512 million and would give the Eastern unions a
30 percent equity stake in the airline in exchange for wage
concessions, The New York Times reported in today's editions.
   Ueberroth has declined comment.
   Icahn and his associates were unavailable for comment on the TWA
board meeting late Tuesday and Texas Air refused even to
acknowledge that its board was gathering. But there was speculation
that the Texas Air directors could decide to remove Chairman Frank
Lorenzo, who has been under siege from Eastern's unions, or to take
Texas Air private.
   Observers also speculated that Minneapolis banker Carl R.
Pohlad, a Texas Air director, could join a bid by Ueberroth.
Pohlad, who owns baseball's Minnesota Twins, reportedly brought
Ueberroth in to negotiate the purchase of Eastern. Pohlad owns 12
percent of Jet Capital Corp., Texas Air's holding company. Lorenzo
owns 48.7 percent of Jet Capital.
   In Miami, meanwhile, Eastern previewed its first post-strike
training class for pilots Tuesday. The six-week course began Monday
with fewer students than the airline projected.
   ``They had more or less hinted around that they were going to
have 50 pilots, but in reality only 35 people showed up,'' Air Line
Pilots Association spokesman Hank Weber said in Miami. ``That's a
drop in the bucket.''
   Also Tuesday, unionized workers at four New York City-area
commuter railroads asked a federal appeals court to overturn a ban
against their striking in sympathy with Eastern employees. The
court did not act immediately.
   An offer from Ueberroth for $300 million to $500 million may be
presented to the Texas Air board in the next few days, airline
industry and baseball sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Ueberroth's term as baseball commissioner ends Saturday.
   The board was to hold regularly scheduled meetings Tuesday and
today, said a source close to the company. But other sources said
substantive discussions probably wouldn't begin until today.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent in Houston said the company
wouldn't comment on whether a board meeting was being held.
   Indications of Ueberroth's interest came as takeover specialist
Icahn was reportedly resuming talks with Eastern's unions about a
possible takeover.
   Icahn has publicly expressed interest and has been supported by
Eastern's unions.
   Icahn was meeting again with union officials to discuss a
possible takeover and hopes to use union concessions to persuade
Eastern's creditors to let him take control, said Brian Freeman, an
investment banker with close ties to the Machinists union.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee Harold Jones, administering Eastern's
Chapter 11 reorganization in New York, said Tuesday he was
continuing to interview about a dozen candidates for Eastern
bankruptcy examiner. He said he hoped to recommend a candidate to
U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Burton Lifland by late this week or
early next.
   Jones declined to name the candidates under consideration.
   He called Ueberroth ``an interesting individual'' who has public
stature. ``He's an interesting force to bring into the mixture,''
Jones said, noting that any proposed sale of Eastern would have to
be approved by the bankruptcy court.

<HEAD>Northwest Says Group Interested In Takeover; Stock Price Soars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of Northwest Airlines says
its board of directors has adopted a ``poison pill' anti-takeover
defense to thwart a possible takeover attempt by an undiclosed
investment group.
   NWA Inc. stock soared Tuesday to a price near its 52-week high
after company officials revealed the proposal.
   The company said the investment group, which holds a 4.9 percent
stake in NWA, recently notified Northwest of its ``interest in
exploring the possibility of a negotiated leveraged acquisition.''
   But it said, ``The company's board of directors has determined
that the interests of the company, its employees, customers and
shareholders will be best served by maintaining the company as an
independent entity and has no intention of pursuing the indication
of interest'' from the investment group. NWA spokesman Kevin Whalen
said he could not comment beyond the company's statement.
   Trading of NWA stock was temporarily halted on the New York
Stock Exchange immediately after the announcement was made. When
trading resumed, the price jumped from $60.75 a share to $69.50 in
heavy trading and closed Tuesday at $70.25, up $9.62{, near its
52-week high of $72.87{.
   Despite Wall Street's enthusiasm, analysts reacted cautiously,
noting that a formal offer for the nation's fifth-largest airline
had not yet been announced.
   ``I hate to be skeptical, but I've seen too many (groups)
indicate some special interest and then they dump their shares,''
said Louis Marckesano, an airline stock analyst for Janney
Montgomery Scott of Philadelphia. ``If the group is legitimate and
they have a legitimate offer in mind, they should come in with a
tender offer.''
   Kurt Rivard, a securities analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. of
Minneapolis, said there is ``less than a 50-50 chance this company
will be acquired.''
   ``But that doesn't mean someone won't try to make a run at
them,'' he added.
   A leveraged buyout would leave the company with too much debt
and impair the airline's ability to keep its fleet modern, Rivard
said. Growing government resistance to consolidation of the airline
industry reduces the chances of a successful buyout bid from a
competitor of Northwest, he added.
   Whalen said he could not comment on whether the investment group
has made a formal offer for a friendly takeover of the airline.
Northwest would not reveal the identity of the investment group.
The group's identity would be made public under Securities and
Exchange Commission rules if it obtains 5 percent or more of
Northwest's stock.
   The price of NWA stock, like the stock of other airline
companies, has been volatile in recent months amid takeover
speculation. Several companies and individuals have been rumored as
possible suitors for Northwest, including Carl Icahn, Donald Trump
and American Airlines.
   Jim Halvorson, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
said Tuesday that the union had not been told the identity of the
investment group.
   ``We have no notion at all,'' he said.
   Guy Cook, chairman of the Machinists Local 143, which represents
nearly two-thirds of Northwest's 35,000 employees, said that union
would do whatever possible to prevent the airline from being taken
over by someone who would break it up and sell it off.
   Monday's action by Northwest's board of directors sets up an
anti-takeover defense that would make Northwest less attractive to
a hostile suitor intending to break up the company, said Bob
Gibbons, a company spokesman.
   Under the ``poison pill'' plan, shareholders will have the
chance to buy one one-hundredth of a share of a new series of
preferred stock for $225 when a person or group acquires 15 percent
of common stock or announces a tender offer that would result in
ownership of 15 percent or more of the voting power.
   The initial takeover price for a hostile suitor wouldn't
increase because of the new stock, but the acquiring person or
group would not be able to reap benefits from the sale of assets
following the takeover, Gibbons said. Under the ``poison pill,''
the new owners would have to distribute income from the sale of
assets to holders of the preferred stock, Gibbons said. He said
many other American companies have similar anti-takeover defenses.
   ``This is a plan designed to ensure that our constituents are
best served by any offer that we may get,'' Whalen said.
   NWA reported 1988 record earnings of $135.1 million, or $4.63 a
share, up 31.1 percent from $103 million, or $3.59 a share, in
1987. In August 1986, Northwest acquired rival Republic Airlines
for $884 million.

<TEXT>
   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened
unexpectedly to $3.73 billion in February as exports fell faster
than imports, the government reported Wednesday.
   Most economists had expected the deficit to narrow slightly.
   The seasonally adjusted February shortfall compared with a
deficit of $3.57 billion in January and a gap of $2.56 billion in
February 1988, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
   With February's trade in invisible items _ which covers
services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer
payments _ estimated to be in surplus by $850 million, Britain's
current account showed a deficit of $2.88 billion in February. That
compared with a revised deficit of $2.72 billion in January.
   Exports totaled $11.61 billion in February, down 7.4 percent
from $12.53 billion in January and up from $10.55 billion in
February 1988.
   Imports totaled $15.34 billion in February, down 4.7 percent
from $16.1 billion in January and up from $13.1 billion in February
1988.
   Since the beginning of 1989, Britain's merchandise trade balance
has been in deficit by $7.3 billion, compared with a deficit of
$5.03 billion a year earlier.
   The current account has been in deficit by $5.6 billion so far
this year, compared with a deficit of $3.88 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Appeals Court To Decide If Railroad Workers Can Strike In Sympathy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court reserved ruling on a
request by unionized workers at four metropolitan area commuter
railroads to overturn a ban against their striking in sympathy with
Eastern Airlines employees.
   Lawyers for the railroads argued Tuesday before the three-member
panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that the Railway
Labor Act requires the railroad employees to stay on the job until
they go through a series of mediation steps.
   Until the 2nd Circuit decides otherwise, U.S. District Judge
Robert Patterson Jr.'s injunctions against sympathy strikes remain
in force.
   At issue is whether unionized workers at the Long Island Rail
Road, NJ Transit, Metro-North Commuter Railroad and Amtrak may
honor picket lines set up by machinists who struck Eastern on March
4.
   Both the unions and the railroads agree that if all or most
union workers honored the machinists' picket lines, the four
railroads would have to shut down, throwing transportation
facilities into chaos for more than 400,000 daily commuters in the
New York metropolitan area.
   On March 20, Patterson barred the railroad unions from honoring
the picket lines and ordered union officials to tell their members
to go to work if any picket lines went up at railroad facilities.
   ``We have been stripped of the most fundamental right that labor
has: to withdraw its services and to call upon other workers to
withdraw their services,'' Joseph Guerrieri Jr., lawyer for the
unions, told the appeals panel.
   He claimed that because the railroad workers have no dispute
with their own employers they would not have to go through the
numerous steps required by the Railway Labor Act before walking off
the job in a sympathy strike.
   But Bernard Plum, lawyer for the LIRR and Metro-North, said the
Railway Labor Act encompassed all disputes and to claim workers
could strike if they said there was no dispute ``defies logic.''

<HEAD>Terex Unit Buys Fruehauf Trailer Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt-ridden Fruehauf Corp. is selling its truck
trailer business, but the familiar name still will be on the road,
the buyer says.
   ``We plan to continue in the trailer business. We plan to
continue the Fruehauf name,'' said Marvin Rosenberg, secretary of
Green Bay, Wis.-based Terex Corp., said Tuesday.
   Detroit-based Fruehauf said it will sell its trailer operation,
two shipping dry docks in Florida and one in Maryland, and its 80
percent interest in CEMCO, a maker of ship loading cranes, to a
Terex subsidiary for $232.5 million.
   The subsidiary, FRH Acquisition, will pay $169.4 million in cash
and assume about $63.1 million in long-term debt in a transaction
expected to be closed May 15, Fruehauf said.
   Fruehauf, still battling debt from a 1986 leveraged buyout, also
will be entertaining offers for its major remaining business,
Kelsey-Hayes Co., a maker of aluminum wheels, anti-lock braking
systems and other auto components, Fruehauf spokesman David A.
Hladik said.
   Anthony G. Viscogliosi, a securities analyst at Roney &amp; Co. in
Detroit, said Kelsey-Hayes will be an attractive acquisition target.
   Suitors could include German, Japanese or other foreign
companies that want a foothold in the U.S. automobile equipment
market and currently enjoy a currency-exchange advantage,
Viscogliosi said.
   Rosenberg declined to comment on what changes Terex plans for
Fruehauf employees and plants.
   Elsewhere, efficiency has ruled when the maker of heavy-duty,
off-road earth-moving equipment has acquired troubled companies and
brought them to profitability, he said.
   ``We have focused on manufacturing efficiencies, looking at
their strengths, where their profits lie, and making sure they are
not overburdened with large overcapacity,'' he said.
   Other Terex units such as Northwest Engineering Co. in Green
Bay, Unit Rig Inc. in Tulsa, Okla., and Koehring Cranes and
Excavators Inc. in Iowa were in financial trouble when acquired,
Rosenberg said. ``They are all now profitable.''
   Viscogliosi said shocks and adjustments are likely but predicted
a favorable outcome.
   ``I would think it would be a plus in terms of morale for the
employees. They're finally going to get out from under,'' he said.
   Fruehauf had been reviewing several acquisition proposals,
including one from Varity Corp., a Toronto farm equipment maker
that used to be called Massey-Ferguson, that was withdrawn Feb. 27,
Hladik said.
   Negotiations between Terex and Fruehauf intensified in the past
week and were concluded Monday night, Rosenberg said.
   Fruehauf has sold off divisions and recently proposed a
recapitalization plan in the wake of the 1986 leveraged buyout that
created more than $1 billion in debt.
   Fruehauf managers arranged the buyout with the financial help of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., which obtained a 31 percent voting interest,
to avoid a takeover bid by New York investor Asher Edelman. Edelman
sold his Fruehauf stock at a profit and also received a $21 million
payment from the company.
   Fruehauf, which employs about 15,800 people, reported losses of
$41.5 million on revenue of $1.96 billion in 1987 and losses of
$56.5 million on revenue of $2.09 billion in 1988.

<TEXT>
   Makers of apple sauces and juices presented
test results today showing the products to be virtually free of
Alar, a chemical that environmentalists say heightens the risk of
cancer in children.
   The Processed Apple Institute, which represents most of the
producers of apple sauces and juices, said today tests covering
4,623 samples and a cross-section of brand names revealed only
eight cases in which detectable levels of Alar were found in the
product.
   Larry Davenport, executive director of the Atlanta-based trade
association, said a detectable level meant a trace of at least 1
part per million in the sample, or 20 times below the tolerance
level established by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   ``We're talking about truly insignificant levels here,''
Davenport said Tuesday in a telephone interview.
   There has been widespread concern reported among parents in
recent weeks over the health effects of chemicals used on apples.
   A report by the Natural Resources Defense Council, a private
environmental group, concluded last month that children are
especially at risk from such chemicals because they eat a much
larger volume of apples and other fruits and vegetables compared to
their weight than do adults.
   New York Agriculture Commissioner Richard McGuire, whose state
ranks second behind Washington in apple production, today termed
apples ``totally safe,'' with alar found on only about 20 percent
and, in those cases, well below levels that cause concern.
   ``The issue is larger than alar,'' McGuire said on ``CBS This
Morning.'' ``Let me say that the concern of agriculture in general
is the removal of many of the other pesticides, many of the other
chemicals that we use in agriculture, which makes it possible to
feed the poor people of the world.''
   Asked whether growers can by without alar, McGuire said: ``They
certainly can, and if across the country they do they'll have
poorer quality apples, a short supply in the late winter and spring
months until the next season comes around.''
   But Jay Feldman of the National Coalition Against the Misuse of
Chemicals, contended on the CBS broadcast that ``alar is
dangerous,'' especially in combination with many other chemicals
used on foods.
   ``We're, in a sense, assaulting an American through his or her
daily diet when we sit down at the dinner table,'' he said.
   Alar, technically known as daminozide, was singled out by the
NRDC study, although industry and government officials have said
only from 5 percent to 10 percent of apples are sprayed with the
chemical. Alar regulates growth and increases shelf life.
   Daminozide has been found to cause cancer in test animals, and
the EPA has said it intends to ban its use. But the regulatory
process could take several years.
   Davenport said that the test results assembled by the institute
were from tests conducted on apple sauce and juice from 1987 to the
present in four states _ New York, Oregon, Massachusetts and
Washington _ by regulatory agencies, independent testing
laboratories and processors.
   Of the 4,623 samples, eight had traces of Alar of at least 1
part per million with the highest residue being 1.3 parts per
million, said Davenport. He said the samples represents brands
across the board, including all the major brands such as Mott,
Seneca, and Tree Top.
   ``This study confirms that ... the industry has successfully
screened Alar from its products,'' said Hugh Ewart, chairman of the
processor group's technical committee.
   Most apple processors began putting growers on notice in 1986
that they did not want apples that had been treated with Alar, but
Davenport said traces of the chemical continue to be found because
the chemical stays in the trees.

<HEAD>TWA Placing $3.6 Billion Airbus Order</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trans World Airlines has announced plans to
update and expand its fleet with the purchase of up to 40 Airbus
Industrie jetliners in a deal worth more than $3.6 billion _ the
latest in a series of big aircraft purchases by U.S. airlines.
   TWA, the nation's eighth-largest air carrier, said Tuesday it
had placed firm orders for twenty A330-300 wide-body aircraft, with
options to purchase 20 more of the twin-engine planes.
   The two companies said in a statement TWA could convert up to
half the ordered planes and half the optioned jets to A340s,
Airbus' four-engine, long-range wide-body aircraft.
   TWA had been expected to announce an order since last October,
when it said it would lease or buy 60 new narrow-bodied aircraft.
The airline's chairman, Carl Icahn, said Tuesday the company also
plans to buy narrow-bodied planes in the future.
   Business has been booming recently for domestic and foreign
aircraft manufacturers. Over the past two months, American Airlines
announced up to $14 billion in aircraft purchases planned through
1994, including planes by U.S. companies Boeing Co. and
McDonnell-Douglas Corp. and the Dutch manufacturer Fokker.
   In January, Braniff Inc. said it would buy up to 100 Airbus 320
jets in a deal that could reach $3.5 billion.
   Icahn said in an interview that TWA's new planes would be used
to expand its fleet and replace older aircraft. Icahn said the
carrier's planes have an average age of 12.5 years.
   TWA's unions have complained in recent years about its aging
planes, contending that Icahn had agreed to upgrade the fleet in
acquiring the airline in 1986.
   But Icahn denied Tuesday that the Airbus purchase resulted from
any union pressure to revitalize the TWA fleet.
   Airbus Industrie said it expected to begin delivering the A330s
to TWA in late 1994 or early 1995.
   TWA said it would use the planes, which seat 301 passengers
each, on major North American and trans-Atlantic routes.
   Airbus Industrie, owned by a European consortium, is a major
competitor of Boeing and McDonnell-Douglas.
   Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Craig Martin said his
company had competed for the TWA order with its 767 widebody
twin-jet plane.
   In the past, TWA has been a good Boeing customer, buying the
company's 727s, 747s and 767s in its fleet. It currently has no
Boeing planes on order.
   William Whitlow, who follows Boeing for the investment firm Dain
Bosworth Co. in Seattle, said, ``I suspect that Airbus maybe had
some fairly attractive terms in terms of price and financing.''
   ``Boeing's not going to win them all,'' he said, referring to
Boeing announcements so far this year of orders for 102 aircraft
worth more than $8.2 billion, on top of last year's record orders
for 636 jets worth $29.7 billion.
   Phil Friedman, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said
he doubted Boeing's backlog of orders was a factor in the TWA
purchase.
   ``They would have been able to get 767s by 1994,'' when the
A330s are scheduled to be delivered, he said.
   McDonnell-Douglas had no comment on the TWA-Airbus deal, said
Don Hanson, a spokesman for the company's Douglas Aircraft division.
   But, he added, ``TWA has been a good customer of ours for our
MD-80s and we expect that good and fruitful relationship to
continue...''
   The narrow-body MD-80s are among TWA's newer planes.
   Icahn took TWA private last October. In the third quarter of
1988, the company reported earnings of $88 million, up from $57.1
million a year earlier, while its revenue rose to $1.27 billion
from $1.21 billion.
   The company has not yet released fourth-quarter figures, but a
TWA source said earnings rose during the period.

   Stock prices rose early today as the dollar held
its ground against further intervention by major central banks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which rose more
than 30 points in the first two sessions this week, was up 4.70 at
2,280.24 as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Rising issues outnumbered declining ones about 7 to 4 on the New
York Stock Exchange, with 561 higher, 322 lower and 535 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.51 million shares as of 10
a.m. EST.
   The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators
fell 0.3 percent in February, following a revised 0.7 percent
increase in January. The announcement had little apparent effect on
the market, which has been paying more attention to the value of
the dollar.
   The central banks of the United States and West Germany were
reportedly selling dollars today to put a lid on the currency's
recent rise. The dollar's strength has come about from expectations
that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to stem
inflation. High rates are attractive to foreign investors.
   The governor of Japan's central bank was quoted as saying that
dollar buying has been ``overdone'' and that the Bank of Japan
would intervene if necessary to stem the dollar's further rise
against the yen. The powerful bank has been absent from coordinated
intervention so far.

<HEAD>Coffee Producers Meet Ahead Of Key Talks with Consumers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from major coffee producing
countries will meet here later this week to discuss strategy for
talks with consuming countries on the future of international
cooperation to stabilize world prices.
   The 25 producing countries belonging to the Inter-African Coffee
Organization will meet here Thursday and Friday, and the 11-nation
group of producers of the top-quality mild arabica type of coffee
will meet separately on Friday.
   Delegates from both groups said Wednesday that a joint meeting
of all 50 International Coffee Organization producer members was
unlikely ahead of Monday's start of two weeks of talks with the
body's 25 key consuming countries.
   This joint meeting is the last scheduled attempt to negotiate a
new international price-stabilization agreement to replace the
present one which expires at the end of September.
   Producers were expected to make proposals for the new pact at
the joint meeting, said Jorge Ortega, Mexico's permanent coffee
representative here.
   Ortega also is the spokesman for a third group of mild arabica
coffee producers known as the ``others.'' Members of this group
include Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and
Peru.
   His group's meeting will ``probably translate into a proposal''
aimed at increasing its share of the market under a new pact,
Ortega said.
   Delegates said that a fight to increase market share would bring
the ``others'' into conflict with most African countries and with
Brazil.
   They produce types of coffee less popular with consumers, but
are anxious to hold on to present market shares.
   The United States and the European Economic Community want any
new coffee pact to increase the participation of ``other'' milds in
the market.
   Like the present coffee agreement, any new deal would probably
use export quotas to regulate supply and prices.

   The U.S. Justice Department is dropping
its opposition to Consolidated Freightways Inc.'s acquisition of
Emery Air Freight Corp., saying it is unlikely a more acceptable
buyer for the troubled company can be found.
   The decision Tuesday removed antitrust obstacles to the deal,
under which Consolidated, based in Menlo Park, Calif., agreed last
month to buy Wilton-based Emery for $230 million.
   The Justice Department recently asked Emery to contact more than
20 parties the company identified last year as potential buyers to
see if any were interested, because of concerns the Consolidated
deal would curtail competition in the overnight air-freight
industry.
   In a statement issued from Washington, Charles F. Rule,
assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division,
said the department still believed the acquisition would likely
prove anticompetitive, noting that the industry is dominated by
only four carriers.
   But, Rule said, ``After a thorough investigation, we concluded
that if the department tried to challenge the proposed acquisition,
Emery would be successful in establishing a failing firm defense
under the antitrust laws.''
   Under the failing firm doctrine, an otherwise anticompetitive
acquisition is not unlawful if two requirements are met: The
company being acquired must show that it will not be able to meet
its financial obligations through the use of existing assets and
that it probably would not emerge from a restructuring or
reorganization as a viable competitor.
   The company must also show that no other buyer that would
represent less of a threat to competition is willing to purchase
its assets.
   ``We are pleased we have cleared this last regulatory
requirement,'' Patricia Bertrand, an Emery spokeswoman, said today.
``Both companies ... are anxious to get the merger completed.
   Consolidated extended its tender offer until midnight Friday.
   Industry analysts said it could have spelled the end of Emery if
the Justice Department had blocked the sale.
   Emery lost $51 million last year after losing $48 million in
1987.
   ``Emery is going to get acquired or it is going to go
bankrupt,'' said Mike Walker, an analyst with Legg Mason Wood
Walker Inc. in Baltimore.
   ``Emery is a mess,'' he said. ``It's losing a lot of money and
if Consolidated Freight cuts it loose, it will lose a lot more
money.''
   None of the companies being contacted had previously made an
offer for Emery and analysts doubted that another buyer would be
found.
   ``It's a very troubled company,'' said George G. Morris, an
analyst with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc. in Cleveland. ``There
weren't any people stepping up to the plate out of the 20 surveyed.
I would doubt very much anything will be changed.''
   Morris noted that Consolidated is getting all of Emery for $230
million, just two years after Emery bought Purolator Courier Corp.
for $348 million.
   ``That should tell you something about the company and how it's
been doing,'' he said.
   Emery's operations are to be merged with those of Consolidated's
CF Air Freight Inc. unit into a new company to be called Emery
Worldwide.
   Walker said the acquisition would give Consolidated 40 percent
to 50 percent of the overnight air-freight business compared to its
current 20 percent share.
   ``There's more than enough competition out there,'' he said.
``Consolidated Freight is acquiring a very good market position,
but they are not acquiring a monopoly.''
   Consolidated agreed to buy all outstanding Emery common stock
for $7.75 a share in cash and all outstanding Emery preferred stock
for $21.10 a share in stock.
   As of Tuesday, Consolidated said that 89 percent of the common
shares and 75 percent of the preferred stock had been tendered.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Creep Higher On Stronger Export Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices crept higher
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting increased
export demand apparently prompted by a sharp decline in prices
earlier this week.
   Soybean futures were supported in early trading by indications
that the Soviet Union had made a substantial purchase of South
American soybean meal earlier in the week.
   Corn and wheat futures opened fractionally lower following the
Agriculture Department's announcement late Tuesday that the Soviets
had bought 550,000 metric tons of U.S. corn _ much less than the 2
million metric tons that had been rumored during Tuesday's session.
   But grain futures quickly turned higher on news of increased
export demand for wheat, including interest by Sri Lanka, Turkey
and Peru.
   Some traders also remained optimistic that the Agriculture
Department would announce further corn sales to the Soviets.
   In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.29 a bushel; corn was \ cent
lower to } cent higher with May at $2.73} a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1{ cents higher with May at $1.98{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with May at $7.64} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .73 cent higher with April at 78.05
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent higher with
April at 82.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .20
cent higher with April at 42.02 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .08 cent to .18 cent higher with May at 38.15 cents a pound.
   Livestock futures finished mostly lower on Tuesday while pork
bellies advanced.

   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
today called inflation ``a perpetual concern'' and praised recent
actions by the the nation's central bank to nudge up interest rates
to combat rising prices.
   Volcker, speaking with reporters at the White House, voiced
particular praise for the policies of the current Fed chairman,
Alan Greenspan.
   ``The inflation rate has been going up some, and I think we
ought to deal with it,'' said Volcker.
   As Fed chairman, Volcker earned a reputation as the government's
chief inflation fighter in the early 1980s when he pursued a policy
of tight credit that drove up interest rates in a successful effort
to break the back of inflation spiraling in the double digits.
   For the first two months of 1989, inflation at the consumer
price level has been rising at an annual rate of 6.1 percent. At
the wholesale level, prices have been rising at a 12.6 percent
annual rate.
   Volcker, who stepped down from the Fed in 1987 when his term as
chairman expired, said, ``The economy has been doing pretty well,
it keeps growing. What more can I say?''
   Asked directly about inflation, Volcker said, ``When you talk to
me, I think inflation is a perpetual concern. So I'm delighted to
see the concern about inflation openly expressed. I'm delighted to
see what Mr. Greenspan has bene saying about it.''
   Greenspan has argued that higher interest rates are needed in
the short run to keep a lid on inflation _ a position that has put
him at odds with President Bush, who has said he does not share
quite the degree of concern over current inflation that Greenspan
does.
   ``I think Mr. Greenspan is well able to take care of himself in
making those judgments'' on interest rates, Volcker said.
   He also expressed support of current steps taken by ``the
Federal Reserve, generally.''
   Volcker was at the White House to discuss with Bush the final
report of the National Commission on Public Service, which has
recommended pay increases of approximately 50 percent over two
years for top federal officials. Volcker is chairman of the
commission.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday announced a new
incentive program with interest rates as low as 2.9 percent, 2
percentage points lower than the program it replaces.
   The last time automakers' financing companies offered interest
rates as low as 2.9 percent was in mid-1987.
   Robert Rewey, Ford's vice president for North American sales,
said the nation's No. 2 automaker made the move because car and
truck sales during the first 80 days of the year fell below
projections.
   Rewey said Ford had lowered its annual sales prediction for the
industry to 15 million cars and trucks from 15.4 million he talked
about in early February. Sales during the first 80 days of the year
worked out to an annual rate of 14.6 million vehicles, he added.
   Although consumer confidence in the economy remains high, Rewey
said, car buyers have been hesitating because of recent moves by
the Federal Reserve and large banks that have pushed up interest
rates.
   ``There has to be concern of the very rampant move of interest
rates in the first quarter (of 1989),'' he said at a news
conference.
   The prime lending rate, a benchmark rate on which many other
interest charges are based, has increased by 1 percentage point to
11.5 percent this year.
   Ford's new incentive program, which expires May 31, offers
consumers the option of cash rebates, ranging from $300 to $4,000
or financing as low as 2.9 percent for a two-year loan, depending
on model.
   The deals are being offered on various cars carrying Ford,
Lincoln and Mercury nameplates and on some Ford trucks.
   General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Corp. also offer rebates or
low interest rate incentives on a variety of their cars and trucks.
Some of the GM offers expire as early as Monday. Chrysler's
incentives run indefinitely.
   There was no immediate move by GM or Chrysler to match Ford's
new incentive package.

   What this country needs is an Emily Post for
facsimile machines, electronic mail, voice messaging, squawk boxes
and car phones.
   Technology has outraced etiquette in these new forms of business
communication, producing such modern plagues as junk fax and the
dead-end phone calls to machines known as ``voice mail jail.''
   Consider these horror stories of bad manners and simple
ineptitude:
   _An overzealous sandwich shop operator faxed his menu to a top
New York state official at the very moment the official was trying
to send an urgent memo to Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   _The Wall Street Journal's Chicago bureau had a scoop fall into
its lap when someone accidentally sent a secret takeover proposal
to its fax machine.
   _The Iran-contra affair unraveled, Watergate-like, when
investigators discovered a treasure trove of electronic mail
messages sent by Lt. Col. Oliver North and his compatriots on an
internal computer system. Unknown to the North group, every message
had been stored on computer tape.
   _In Los Angeles, according to the New York Times, a man pressed
the wrong buttons on his phone and sent a private voice love
message to his entire department.
   These cases may not all involve questions of etiquette in the
narrow sense, but they do show that the business world has not
worked out a comfortable modus vivendi with its own new machinery.
   True, technology is beginning to solve the problems it created.
For example, Forbes magazine says future software will be able to
screen sales pitches from legitimate electronic mail by looking for
telltale words like ``insurance'' and ``financial planner.''
   Still, the time has come for a seasoned practicioner of good
manners and good sense to spell out certain rules of behavior.
Because no one like that has stepped forward, here are some
suggestions for now for 10 Tentative Communication Commandments:
   I. Thou shalt not send unrequested material by fax machine. If
thou must disobey this commandment, thou shalt at least keep thy
junk faxes short and send them during off hours.
   II. Thou shalt not have a machine answering thy company's main
phone line, even if it does have a pleasant voice. People will hang
up.
   III. Thou shalt provide an escape route from ``voice mail jail''
so a caller entrapped in thy system can get back to a human
operator at any time.
   IV. Thou shalt not clutter thy neighbors' electronic mailboxes
simply because it is easy to code them in on messages.
   V. Thou shalt remember when firing off a message by voice or
electronic mail that words can sting and ill-considered words could
come back to haunt thee.
   VI. If thou insists on sending a back-stabbing message, thou
shalt make sure it is going to the intended recipient and not to
the person whose back is being stabbed.
   VII. Thou shalt not put a caller on a speaker phone,
broadcasting his or her voice around the room, unless the caller
agrees to this invasion of privacy.
   VIII. Thou shalt prevent embarrassment by informing the caller
on a squawk box who else is in the room listening to the
conversation.
   IX. Thou shalt not discuss sensitive matters by car phone unless
thou art willing to have others listening in by scanner.
   X. Above all, thou shalt never, in all thy days, refer to
talking as ``real-time interfacing.''

<HEAD>Airline Buccaneer Donald Burr: People Express Founder Ready to Make
A Move</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Donald C. Burr built one of the biggest airlines
from scratch using ultra-cheap fares to draw millions of customers,
only to see his empire collapse six years later. Now he could be
ready to make a comeback.
   Burr, 47, founder of defunct People Express Airlines, has
started to talk to the press after two years of shunning public
view. He has re-emerged at a time when Eastern Airlines, paralyzed
by a strike and in bankruptcy protection from creditors, is
tottering on extinction.
   Could Burr be putting himself forward as a ``white knight''
manager to help rescue Eastern, or gearing up to start a new
airline to replace it? He's dodging the question, but
circumstantial evidence indicates the answer is yes.
   Burr's formal agreement not to compete against former boss Frank
Lorenzo has just effectively expired. Lorenzo, steely chairman of
Texas Air Corp. which controls Eastern, bought a battered People
Express from Burr in September 1986 for $300 million.
   At its zenith in 1985, Newark, N.J.-based People Express was a
wildly successful product of airline deregulation, offering
discount fares to 150 cities and pulling in more than $1 billion a
year in revenue.
   ``I'm trying to find a way to reinvent the (airline) product
again,'' Burr said in an interview.
   Besides lecturing at universities and writing a book about
People Express during the past two years, Burr said he has
informally looked at a few potential new airline deals.
   Industry sources say he spoke with Lorenzo before the Eastern
strike about the possibility of running the carrier. Burr would
only say that he's had ``conceptual'' talks with the Texas Air
chief. Lorenzo has refused to comment.
   What if the rebellious unions at Miami-based Eastern approached
him to help take over or run the airline? ``I'd have to consider
it,'' he said.
   Burr talks with evangelical enthusiasm about the airline
industry, whether he's reminiscing about triumphs and travails of
People Express or looking forward to the next chapter of
deregulation. It's a talent he's honed on the lecture circuit,
where he commands $10,000 a speech.
   ``The airlines are on the verge of unprecedented
profitability,'' he said, perched on the edge of a chair at the
Harvard Club in midtown Manhattan. ``I would love to see the
airline industry evolve toward high-commitment service
organizations.''
   Burr's career path, and life, have been closely intertwined with
Lorenzo's __ he even served as best man at Lorenzo's wedding in
1972. They are only a year apart in age and were both born in May
under the sign of Taurus, the bull. Yet their personalities seem
poles apart.
   With his boyish good looks and disarming ebullience, Burr is a
study in contrasts with the gaunt, fierce-looking Lorenzo, who has
become a leading target of organized labor because of his avowed
anti-union strategies.
   Burr, born in suburban South Windsor, Conn., has been described
by people in the industry as a preppie entrepreneur. Lorenzo, 48,
grew up in tough, street-wise Queens, N.Y.
   People familiar with the two personalities find it difficult to
imagine Burr working for Lorenzo, which he did twice, and fencing
with him in one of the most brutally competitive businesses of the
1980s.
   They both attended Harvard Business School, where Lorenzo got
his MBA in 1963 and Burr received his in 1965. Burr then went to
work as a financial analyst for National Aviation Corp., a New York
investment company, while Lorenzo was an analyst for Trans World
Airlines Inc. and later for Eastern.
   Burr was elected president of National Aviation in 1971 _ two
years after Lorenzo created Jet Capital Corp., the aircraft leasing
company that was to become the core of Texas Air. In 1973, after
Lorenzo acquired ailing Texas International Airlines, he recruited
Burr, whose National Aviation had been an investor in Lorenzo's
takeover.
   Burr became president of Texas International, where he helped
Chairman Lorenzo introduce discount ``Peanut Fares'' that
revolutionized the industry and made the airline the
fastest-growing U.S. carrier.
   In January 1980, Burr left Texas International to take advantage
of the 1978 deregulation of the industry that let airlines set
their own fares and fly where they wished.
   He started his own low-cost airline, People Express, which
created an enormous new market of air travelers with a
pay-on-board, lug-your-own bags approach that made his planes the
Greyhound buses of the sky.
   After a quick takeoff and supersonic growth, People Express
eventually crashed as big competitors undercut Burr's discount
fares to prevent him from taking away their customers. After it was
sold to what was now Texas Air in September 1986, Burr went back to
work for Lorenzo, but not for long.
   He is careful not to join the Lorenzo-bashing that has become so
popular. The strongest thing Burr will say about Lorenzo is he's a
``low-cost warhound.''
   Burr says he's too busy thinking about what he calls
``reinventing the product'' to dwell on the past. But as for
whether he's preparing to fill a void created if Eastern
disappears, Burr is evasive.
   ``I'm after the same thing I've been after my whole lifetime,''
he said.

<HEAD>Eds: Leads with seven grafs to UPDATE with today's trading. Picks

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices were mixed in early
trading today, with crude oil regaining some of the ground lost in
Tuesday's selloff.
   By noon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract
for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, was
up 11 cents at $20.02.
   On Tuesday, the May crude oil contract had settled at $19.91 a
barrel, down 62 cents from Monday's close.
   In reaction to the Alaskan oil spill that temporarily closed a
major port, the contract had gone up 38 cents a barrel Monday to
close at $20.53, the highest level since Aug. 14, 1987, when it
settled at $20.57.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange today,
heating oil for April delivery was down 0.24 cent to 54.80 cents a
gallon and the April unleaded gasoline contract was up 0.52 cent at
59.20 cents a gallon after two hours of trading.
   Analysts blamed Tuesday's decline largely on profit-taking and
concerns about whether OPEC ministers will ease production
restraints during their meeting in Vienna this week.
   The April contract for wholesale home heating oil plunged on
Tuesday by 2.54 cents closing at 55.04 cents a gallon, after rising
1.06 cents Monday.
   April unleaded gasoline, which gained 1.73 cents in the previous
session, settled down 1.07 cents to 58.68 cents a gallon.
   Monday's rally was triggered by the accident off the Alaskan
port of Valdez, where an Exxon Corp. tanker ran aground and spilled
an estimated 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William
Sound. The accident forced the closing of the port, temporarily
cutting U.S. crude supplies by a quarter.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst at Elders Futures Inc., said the
market sold off Tuesday because prices had risen too high, too fast
in the previous session.
   ``I think the market was overbought,'' he said. ``People are now
cashing in.''
   Also depressing oil prices were worries that the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries might loosen its production quota to
help slow recent price increases at its regular meeting in Vienna.
   ``It introduced an era of uncertainty that didn't exist
before,'' said William Byers, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.
   OPEC ministers were upbeat about the strong crude market but
reluctant to predict that longer-term prices would continue their
recent climb, which has seen WTI rising by some $5 a barrel since
last October.
   The 13 member nations agreed last fall to limit their total
output to 18.5 million barrels a day in the first half of this year
to support a price of $18 a barrel.

<TEXT>
   The government's chief economic forecasting
gauge dropped 0.3 percent in February after posting sharp gains
during the previous two months, the Commerce Department said today.
   February's decline in the department's Index of Leading Economic
Indicators was the first drop since a similar dip last September
and the largest since a 0.8 percent drop last July.
   It was in line with widespread expectations that the economy
will slow this year.
   The leading index, designed to foretell economic activity six to
nine months into the future, had advanced 0.6 percent in December
and 0.7 percent in January after vacillating during much of 1988.
   With labor markets tight and factories operating close to peak
capacity, analysts say some slowdown is needed to keep the economy
from overheating and inflation from spiraling.
   However, analysts are divided over whether the Federal Reserve
Board can successfully engineer a controlled slowdown that
restrains economic growth just enough to ease inflation without
causing a recession.
   The Fed for a year has been pushing up interest rates in order
to relieve inflationary pressures, and it intensified those efforts
after sharp price increases were recorded in January and February.
   At the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater pointed to the index's increase at an annual average rate
of 1.5 percent since August 1988 and 3.5 percent since February
1988.
   ``The trend is still upward and one month's figures don't
provide a real basis for judging any change in that trend,'' he
said.
   In another report today showing the impact of higher interest
rates, the government reported that sales of new, single-family
homes plunged 9.4 percent in February to the lowest level in more
than a year.
   The Commerce Department said sales retreated to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 626,000 in February, following a 2.5
percent increase in January and a 3.7 percent gain in December.
   Fitzwater also sought to minimize the housing statistics,
saying, ``Monthly housing sales vary substantially.''
   He said the figures also reflected higher interest rates and
``probably some slowing in the economy.''
   Irwin Kellner, chief economist for Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co. in New York, said in advance of today's report that the jagged
behavior of the leading index suggests ``the economy has been
slowing down from its overheated pace and that the economy is
continuing to slow down as we work our way into the second quarter
of 1989.''
   Kellner said that despite the Federal Reserve's efforts to
prolong the life of the economic expansion even as it restrains
growth, ``the odds are growing each day'' that the central bank
will push the nation into a recession.
   In February, eight of the 11 indicators that make up the leading
index declined, with the biggest negative factor being a drop in
manufacturer orders for new plants and equipment.
   The other negative factors were a drop in building permits, a
decline in manufacturers' orders for consumer goods, a contraction
in the money supply, a dip in an index of consumer expectations, an
increase in initial claims for unemployment benefits, faster vendor
deliveries to companies signaling slower demand and a decline in
manufacturers' unfilled orders.
   Two indicators made positive contributions: an increase in
prices for raw materials indicating stronger demand, and rising
stock prices.
   One indicator was unchanged last month: the length of the
average work week.
   The various changes left the index at 145.2 percent of its 1982
base of 100. Over the past 12 months, the index has risen 3.5
percent, after climbing 2.4 percent over the previous 12-month
period.
   The economy began the new year with strong momentum, but a
number of government reports on its performance in February pointed
downward, including drops in retail sales, housing construction,
orders for durable goods, manufacturing employment and factory
operating rates.
   Economist David Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua,
N.Y., said that with evidence of an economic slowdown likely to
mount, the Fed probably will ease its grip on the money supply by
mid-year.
   ``The probability is very good that we will avoid a recession,''
Levy said.
   The traditional signal of an oncoming recession is three
straight declines in the leading index. The components of the
composite index were revised last month to improve its forecasting
abilities, but when the new index is applied retroactively, it
flashes two false recession signals since the 1981-82 economic
downturn.
   The economy grew a robust 3.9 percent in 1988, the best showing
in four years, but most private analysts expect the gross national
product to expand only by about 2.7 percent this year, slowed by
higher interest rates and a worsening of the trade deficit.
   President Bush is counting on a 3.2 percent GNP gain to allow
the administration to reduce the federal budget deficit without
raising taxes, but few economists believe the administration's GNP
forecast is realistic.

<HEAD>London Shares Close Mixed, Shrug Off Wider Trade Gap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices managed to shrug off news of a
widening British trade gap Wednesday, recovering in the afternoon
to end the day mixed.
   Equities dipped sharply immediately after release of a report
showing the current account deficit widened in February to 1.696
billion pounds ($2.88 billion) from a revised 1.599 billion-pound
($2.72 billion) shortfall in January.
   But after more consideration, analysts attributed the
worse-than-expected report to erratic items and predicted the trade
report wouldn't add to pressure for higher British interest rates.
The market had been expecting a February current account deficit of
1.45 billion pounds ($2.47 billion).
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 1.2 points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,071.7. The index plunged
as much as 13.9 points following the trade report, but then moved
to a maximum 3.3 points up in the afternoon.
   The Financial Times 30-share index finished 2.5 points lower at
1,705.5. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 0.46 point to
close at 1,180.90.
   Volume was light, with 449.8 million shares changing hands,
compared with 346.9 million shares on Tuesday.
   Dealers also attributed the market's recovery from its lows to a
lack of selling pressure.
   ``People aren't prepared to sell. And if there isn't any selling
pressure, the market can't go down,'' one trader said.
   Internationally oriented stocks once again were among the major
gainers, helped by the dollar's continued strength, despite
concerted intervention by major central banks to push the U.S.
currency lower.

<HEAD>Largest Buyout Proposal Prices Magnet At 630 Million Pounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what would be Britain's largest management
buyout ever, directors of Magnet PLC have offered to purchase the
maker and retailer of home improvement products for a total of
630.4 million pounds ($1.07 billion) in cash.
   The offer values Magnet's ordinary shares at 552.6 million
pounds ($939 million), or 300 pence ($5.10) each. The remainder of
the total price is being offered to buy out the existing Magnet
convertible stock.
   Shares in Magnet finished at 309 pence ($6.35) on London's Stock
Exchange, up 20 pence (34 cents).
   Meanwhile, Magnet stockholders are being offered new shares that
are convertible into stock of the buyout vehicle, known as DMWSL
033 PLC.
   Conversion of the new stock, which would amount to a 20-percent
stake in DMWSL, would take place if the company is sold or
refloated on the stock market.
   Magnet Chairman Tom Duxbury, who would take over as chairman and
chief executive of DMWSL, has in recent years steered the company
from being a supplier to the building trade to being a retailer.
   This change of strategic direction, coupled with an uncertain
outlook for British consumer spending in coming months, is expected
to have an adverse impact on the company's stock price in the
short- to medium-term, Duxbury said in a statement.
   The cash portion of the buyout offer represents a 47-percent
premium over the Magnet share price of 204 pence ($3.47) just prior
to the January announcement that a management buyout was being
considered.
   Magnet had profit before tax of 57.5 million pounds ($98
million) on revenue of 375.6 million pounds ($639 million) in 1988.

<HEAD>Regulators Seize Much of MCorp, Second-Largest Texas Bank</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Subs last graf to correct Gardner's first name to James sted

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators today seized control of 20
subsidiary banks of MCorp, Texas' second largest banking company,
and pumped in $300 million in government money.
   The action put all but five MCorp subsidiary banks under
government ownership. Regulators transferred $11.6 billion in
deposits of the failed banks to a new, government-owned
institution, Deposit Insurance Bridge Bank of Dallas.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which insures commercial
bank deposits up to $100,000, said the failed banks opened for
business today and service to customers would continue
uninterrupted.
   ``As far as the customers are concerned it will be business as
usual for all 20 banks,'' said L. William Seidman, chairman of the
FDIC.
   Seidman would not estimate how much the government will
ultimately have to spend to restore the banks to health, saying he
did not want to reveal that figure to investors expected to bid on
the banks.
   However, private analysts have said they expect the failure will
cost the FDIC, already depleted by a post-Depression record 221
bank failures last year, $1 billion to $2 billion.
   That would make the transaction the third most costly commercial
bank rescue, after First RepublicBank of Dallas in 1988 Continental
Illinois of Chicago in 1984.
   ``We are going to proceed with the sale as promptly as
possible,'' Seidman said, but he added that the agency may extend
its April 3 deadline for offers.
   MCorp, which has 86 offices, lost $903 million last year. It is
the last of the large Texas banks to needing to be recapitalized,
either through federal rescue or private merger.
   In a statement today, MCorp said the five remaining banks and
the trust subsidiary ``form the nucleus of a new beginning for
MCorp'' which still intends to file for bankruptcy protection.
   ``While the nature of of MCorp has been altered dramatically, a
solid, healthy core remains,'' Chairman Gene H. Bishop said. ``We
are extremely pleased that this group of five MBanks had the
strength and resourcefulness to withstand the incredible pressures
of the economic downturn over the past several years.''
   Regulators said the 20 insolvent banks had assets of $15.4
billion, including assets of $6.4 billion at the lead bank in
Dallas and $3.2 billion at the next biggest subsidiary in Houston.
The five remaining insolvent banks have assets of about $3 billion.
   Comptroller of the Currency Robert Clarke, the chief regulator
of nationally chartered banks, the figure was triggered by demands
beginning Monday on the lead bank in Dallas, both from depositors
and from the other banks in the holding company.
   On Tuesday, ``it became clear as the day wore on that the
(Dallas) bank was not going to be able to meet the demands of
depositors,'' Clarke said. Five of the banks were insolvent
standing on their own and the remaining 15 failed after the Dallas
bank could not meet their demands for deposits. The demands of all
outside customers were met, he said.
   Federal action was complicated by the fact that regulators
legally could not take control of the five MCorp subsidiary banks
that remain solvent. The move against the 20 has triggered a battle
over assets held by the holding company. Regulators maintain that
holding company assests should be used to defer federal costs in
rescuing the insolvent subsidiary banks, but MCorp has resisted
that.
   ``The FDIC intends to pursue potential claims against MCorp for
liabilities and obligations of MCorp to the 20 subsidiary banks
that were closed,'' the agency said in a statement.
   Seidman, the FDIC chairman, declined to say how large the claim
against the holding company is except to say it is ``substantial''
and ``material.'' Since last year, the insurance fund had been
trying to force the holding company to inject $400 million into 18
of its banks.
   For future cases, the FDIC is seeking legislation from Congress
that would permit it to force solvent subsidiary banks to back up
sister institutions that fail.
   The FDIC's move came a week after creditors of MCorp forced it
to seek protection under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code.
The holding company had halted payments on $466 million in debt
last October but had asked creditors to refrain from pressing their
claims while it attempted to work out an assistance agreement with
the FDIC.
   Reportedly among those interested in buying MCorp is A. Robert
Abboud, chairman of First City Bancorporation in Houston, which was
itself rescued by the FDIC in 1987 with $1 billion.
   Other likely bidders are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the
Pritzker family of Chicago and a group led by Harry Gray, former
chairman of United Technologies Corp.
   The 20 MCorp banks seized today were: MBank Abilene, MBank
Alamo, MBank Austin, MBank Brenham, MBank Corsicana, MBank Dallas,
MBank Denton County, MBank Fort Worth, MBank Greenville, MBank
Houston, MBank Jefferson, MBank Longview, MBank Marshall, MBank
Midcities, MBank Odessa, MBank Orange, MBank Round Rock, MBank
Sherman, MBank Wichita Falls and MBank The Woodlands.
   The five remaining solvent banks are MBank Brownsville, MBank
Corpus Christi, MBank Waco, MBank El Paso and MBank New Braunfels.
A six subsidiary, MTrust Corp., also remains solvent.
   All creditors and depositors, even those with accounts higher
than the $100,000 insurance limit, are fully protected at all of
the failed banks, except the subsidiary in Abilene. Depositors with
more than $100,000 in that institution will have to pursue a claim
against the bank and may lose a portion of their uninsured funds.
   The FDIC appointed James Gardner, chairman of MBank Dallas, as
president of its new government-owned holding company. It said it
will seek a new chairman from outside the MCorp system.

   An aggressive exporter for decades, Japan finds
itself on the receiving end as Asian neighbors pursuing the
Japanese path to success edge into its home market for products
ranging from clothes to cassette players.
   The government is squeezed between domestic demands for
protection from foreign exporters and international pressure to buy
more abroad to cut Japan's mammoth trade surplus.
   At least one prominent economist, Heizo Takenaka of Osaka
University, has suggested avoiding the U.S. pattern of limiting
some imports to protect domestic industries.
   Writing in a recent issue of the Economist magazine, Takenaka
said such restraints ``have weakened the competitive power of
American industry and damaged the economic well-being of
consumers.''
   South Korea and Taiwan are leading the Asian assault on the
Japanese market, capturing the dominant share of textiles.
   ``Manufactured goods from Asia really began taking off in Japan
over the last year or two because the yen's rapid appreciation has
made them very inexpensive,'' said Naruaki Fujisaki of the Asian
Institute of Developing Economies.
   ``And we can expect the trend to continue,'' the researcher
said, adding that the new competition has forced Japanese
manufacturers to set up operations in East and Southeast Asia,
where labor costs are lower.
   South Korean exports to Japan surged by 156 percent in the first
nine months of 1988, with textile exports growing 160 percent,
machinery 165 percent and steel products 224 percent, according to
the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
   Taiwan expanded exports to Japan by 152 percent in 1987, with
textile products up 165 percent and machinery 182 percent, ministry
figures show.
   Japanese investment in Asia, meanwhile, soared by almost 110
percent in the fiscal year ended March 1988 to $486.8 million
compared with the year-earlier period, the Japan External Trade
Organization reported in January.
   Japan's textile makers, whose losses nearly doubled to $7
billion in 1988 from $3.4 billion a year earlier, have taken steps
to protect themselves.
   After imports of South Korean knitwear soared by more than 60
percent last year, domestic makers accused the South Koreans of
dumping, a customer-grabbing strategy of selling goods at up to 40
percent below the fair home-market price.
   South Korean sweater makers avoided the first Japanese
government investigation for dumping by agreeing in February to
limit Japan-bound exports for three years to within 1 percent of
the 1988 volume of 63.4 million sweaters.
   ``We were not only thinking of the knitwear sector,'' said
Kagayaki Miyazaki, head of the Japan Textile Federation. ``The
rules that we established will also contribute to steel, cement and
other sectors.''
   The agreement, however, has raised criticism that Japan is
backtracking on its pledge to promote free trade.
   ``As a country heavily dependent on global markets, Japan should
normally be expected to be the leader in the battle against
protectionism,'' the Nikkei Shimbun, Japan's leading economic
newspaper, commented editorially. It called the agreement ``overly
protective.''
   For years, Japan has been the target of charges by trading
partners that its manufacturers have been dumpers themselves. Some
of the most recent charges involved semiconductor computer chips.
   To meet foreign demands, the Japanese also have been voluntarily
restraining some exports, such as U.S.-bound cars.
   Japan is under pressure from the United States and other trading
partners to reduce its trade surplus by absorbing imports from
developing Asian nations that have been relying on U.S. and
European markets.
   Its overall trade surplus totaled $77.4 billion in 1988, with
the United States accounting for $47.61 billion, Finance Ministry
figures show.
   Kazuaki Hasegawa of the trade ministry's International Trade
Policy Bureau said the knitwear dispute was a special case, and
that Japan is committed to unrestricted trade and importing more
from neighbors.
   ``In Japan, the knitwear association consists of small- and
medium-size companies and if there's a sudden increase (in imports)
it's particularly hard on these weak companies,'' he said. ``In
that case we need countermeasures.'' The United States also has
negotiated restraints with such major textile exporters as South
Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
   Most of Japan's 8,000 knit makers, who employ 150,000 workers,
are smalltime operations in a fading industry.
   But in such major Japanese sectors as steel, petrochemicals and
electronics, Asian neighbors are working to establish a foothold
too.
   Steel imports, almost half from South Korea, rose from 2.9
million tons in fiscal 1985 to 5 million tons in fiscal 1987. With
foreigners holding a 10 percent market share, domestic makers are
starting to clamor for a dumping investigation.
   Japan's petrochemical industry faces keen competition from the
South Korean, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore in the near future, a
governmental advisory committee warned in a recent report.
   South Korea is due to start two large chemical plants in 1989
and others are planned in Taiwan and other Asian nations.
   Japanese electronics and appliance makers saw profits climb in
1988 from sales of more sophisticated products such as large-screen
televisions and a decline in the popularity of cheap electronic
imports from Asian neighbors.
   But South Korea and Taiwan are preparing to follow Japan's path
into higher technology, raising Japanese industry resistance to
sharing technology with these competitors.
   Goldstar Co., a major South Korean electronics maker, has
announced plans to boost the value of electronics exports to Japan
from $250 million in 1988 to $400 million this year. Other South
Korean electronics exporters also have doubled their targets for
exporting competitive products to Japan.

   Japan's most powerful business organization said
Wednesday its members will increase direct investment in developing
countries to aid those indebted nations.
   The Federation of Economic Organizations said it had established
two new semigovernmental groups composed of representatives of
leading Japanese corporations to promote direct investment in the
Third World.
   ``It's important for us to provide not only money but technology
and management'' to help develop industries in such countries,
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita said at a meeting of the federation.
   The two new groups, the Japan International Development
Organization (JAIDO) and the Committee on International Cooperation
Projects, are considering investments in some 80 proposed projects,
including an industrial park in the Philippines, a copper mine in
Mexico and rubber and eucalyptus cultivation in other countries.
   JAIDO will be set up as a joint stock company with capital
provided by 98 corporations and the government's Overseas Economic
Cooperation Fund. It will use its funds for direct investment in
joint ventures.
   The second group will act as liaison between JAIDO and
appropriate government bodies. It also will examine JAIDO's
proposed investments in light of investment guidelines endorsed by
the government and the Federation of Economic Organizations to
ensure the projects are not aimed at promoting Japanese exports.
   Although no projects have been chosen, members of the groups
said four or five would begin this year and 10 would be selected in
1990.
   The projects will be joint ventures with developing countries or
international organizations, such as the World Bank and the United
Nations Industrial Development Organization.
   Following the example of the Japanese government the federation
decided to involve Japan's private sector in economic development
efforts, members said.
   ``Private business is willing to take risks in supporting the
self-help efforts of others,'' Kazuo Haruna of Marubeni Corp. told
reporters after the federation's gathering.
   In a related development, the government Wednesday approved a
$478 million loan to Brazil, the first loan to be extended by Japan
to the heavily-indebted nation in four years.
   The yen-based government loan will be used for a major
irrigation project and harbor improvement at a major port, among
other undertakings.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed little
changed Wednesday after a quiet session on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
   Corn and soybean futures finished slightly lower, reflecting
disappointment in the Agriculture Department's announcement late
Tuesday that the Soviet Union had purchased 550,000 metric tons of
U.S. corn. Traders had been expecting a sale of about 2 million
metric tons.
   Losses in the soybean market were limited by indications that
the Soviet Union had made a substantial purchase of South American
soybean meal earlier in the week.
   Wheat futures ended mostly higher on signs of increased export
demand for U.S. wheat, including interest by Sri Lanka, Turkey and
Peru, analysts said.
   Trading activity has slowed ahead of Friday's USDA quarterly
grain stocks report and annual spring planting estimate. Those
reports will form the basis for projections about grain and soybean
prices during the summer growing season.
   At the close, wheat was } cent lower to 1 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.28 a bushel; corn was { cent to
2 cents lower with May at $2.73 a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to
{ cent higher with May at $1.97\ a bushel; and soybeans were 1{
cents to 5 cents lower with May at $7.61 a bushel.

<HEAD>Seven Major Insurance Firms Investing $225 Million in Goldman, Sachs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of seven major insurance companies has
made a $225 million investment in Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., bolstering
the capital of the brokerage and investment banking firm, it was
announced Wednesday.
   The companies, which were not named, will be passive investors,
meaning they will have no voting rights or role in management,
Goldman Sachs said.
   The investment is the second substantial infusion of funds
Goldman Sachs has received in just over two years.
   Japan's Sumitomo Bank Ltd. in late 1986 agreed to purchase a
non-voting stake in Goldman Sachs. Sumitomo agreed to invest up to
$500 million as a limited partner.
   John L. Weinberg, senior partner of Goldman Sachs, described the
latest investment as ``a vote of confidence in the future of our
firm and our leadership in the securities industry.''
   ``It strengthens our substantial capital base, which enables us
to maintain our position as a leading globabl investment banking
firm and to support our clients' market objectives,'' Weinberg said
in a prepared statement.
   With the addition of the $225 million fixed-return equity
investment, Goldman Sachs' partnership capital will be raised to
$2.1 billion, a company spokesman said.
   In a move related to the investment, Goldman Sachs has formed a
new limited partnership which will be the holding entity for the
investment banking and brokerage company.
   The partners of the new holding company, called Goldman Sachs
Group L.P., will be the current partners of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
plus the new investment group.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Significant Hurdles Stand In Way Of Northwest Suitors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Real estate holdings in Tokyo and other
valuable assets of NWA Inc. make the parent of Northwest Airlines
an attractive takeover target, but analysts on Wednesday said
significant hurdles could ground a possible buyout bid.
   NWA stock activity remained heavy Wednesday in the wake of
Tuesday's announcement that an investment group is interested in a
possible acquisition, but the price was down $2.50 a share to
$67.87{ in late afternoon trading.
   Northwest has not identified the investment group, which it said
holds a 4.9 percent chunk of the airline's 29.1 million shares.
   The group recently notified the Eagan-based company of its
interest in exploring ``a negotiated leveraged acquisition,''
Northwest disclosed. However, no tender offer has been made to
shareholders and the company won't say whether the investment group
has made a formal purchase offer to the board of directors.
Northwest vowed Tuesday to remain independent.
   Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia, said he issued a ``buy'' recommendation
Wednesday morning for Northwest stock because of the takeover
speculation and because balance sheet fundamentals suggest the
stock could reach the $80 range by the end of this year without a
takeover.
   ``It's still below what the stock should be trading at,''
Marckesano said.
   The airline company has become a takeover target because it is a
perennial money maker with assets that could be sold for much more
than their book value, he said.
   Northwest, described by Aviation Daily as the nation's fourth
largest airline in revenue passenger miles, reported a record
profit for 1988 of $135.1 million, up 31 percent from 1987.
   ``There are assets to be sold and they could certainly stand a
lot more debt than they have,'' Marckesano said. ``Someone who
wanted to take it over in the $90 to $100 (a share) range _ that's
perfectly feasible.''
   A buyer could quickly sell Northwest's land holdings in Tokyo,
for example, and use the profits to repay debt incurred in the
acquisition of the airline, Marckesano said. Late last year a
Japanese group offered to pay $350 million for part of the downtown
property. The entire holdings could fetch as much as $500 million,
analysts have said.
   Northwest's Pacific routes, the envy of the industry, also could
be sold to repay acquisition debts. Marckesano said a new owner
also could raise money by selling some equipment and then leasing
it.
   He said he isn't concerned about a ``poison pill'' defense
adopted Monday by Northwest's board of directors because he said it
merely protects against someone ``stealing'' the company.
   Robert Decker of Chicago-based Duff &amp; Phelps agreed that the
``poison pill'' won't stand in the way of a legitimate offer. But
he said a sound leveraged buyout proposal is unlikely.
   ``The scenario I can see is someone coming in and buying the
airline and running it like it is,'' Decker said. ``To make that
doable, it can't involve a lot of debt so it can't be a leveraged
buyout. Then you're down to a very few potential buyers for it.''
   In a leveraged buyout, the buyers typically borrow heavily
against the cash flow or the assets of the target to make the deal.
   Too much debt would cripple Northwest because the airline will
need all the cash it can muster in coming years to buy new jets,
Decker said. The average aircraft in the company's 312-jet fleet is
14.4 years old compared with the industry average of 11.7 years, he
said.
   Mark Daugherty of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York said the
burdensome debts of a leveraged buyout would also make the company
especially vulnerable in an economic downturn.
   ``The idea of cutting back on capital spending and letting
excess cash flow pay down the debt _ I don't think you could really
get away with that,'' Daugherty said.
   Daugherty and Decker also said the U.S. Justice Department could
pose a problem for suitors interested in a breakup of the airline.
The proposed sale of routes, airport gates or other transportation
operations at Northwest would be subject to antitrust
investigations, limiting the number of potential buyers, they said.
   ``The industry is more concentrated today. There are fewer
players,'' said Charles F. Rule, assistant attorney general in
charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division. ``For that
reason one can say that a proposed further concentration is likely
to attract a good deal of Justice Department scrutiny.''
   Yet another potential problem could rise from labor ranks at
Northwest. Guy Cook, chairman of the International Association of
Machinists District Lodge 143, which represents nearly two-thirds
of Northwest's 35,000 employees, said Wednesday that workers would
go as far as staging an illegal strike to prevent the sale of
Northwest to a hostile buyer.
   ``Our message to any potential buyer is very clear,'' Cook said.
``If there is an indication on their part there will be a breakup,
there's going to be all out war on this airline.''

   Stock prices edged higher in another quiet
session today on Wall Street.
   Traders said there were no factors clearly moving the market,
since government statistics on the economy fell in line with
expectations and prices of bonds and stocks were little changed.
   The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators
fell 0.3 percent in February, following a revised 0.7 percent
increase in January.
   The figure was close to Wall Street's forecast and thus had
little effect on trading, said Peter VandenBerg, a market analyst

   The bond market was flat for most of the session before rising
late in the day. The dollar remained buoyant, resisting dollar
sales by the Federal Reserve and major European central banks.

   A federal judge has set a May 1 court
date for the damages phase of Polaroid Corp.'s patent infringement
suit against Eastman Kodak Co., Polaroid said Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone postponed the trial from
April 17, Polaroid spokeswoman Marcia Phillips said.
   Kodak was found guilty in 1985 of violating several Polaroid
patents on instant cameras and film. Polaroid is seeking $5.7
billion in damages, but Kodak lawyers have said $200 million would
be ``more than ample.''
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month upheld a ruling
by Mazzone refusing to throw out all decisions in the 13-year
dispute on grounds that a previous judge was compromised because
she inherited Kodak stock.

<HEAD>Ford Announces 2.9 Percent Financing, Rebates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co., smarting from lower-than-expected
early 1989 sales, said Wednesday it would offer cash rebates of up
to $4,000 and new-car financing as low as 2.9 percent.
   There was no immediate indication that rivals General Motors
Corp. and Chrysler Corp. would match the move by Ford, which also
said it was scaling back its full-year projections for industrywide
car and light truck sales.
   GM and Chrysler currently offer cash rebates of up to $2,000 and
financing as low as 4.9 percent on a variety of cars and trucks.
   Ford _ which had been offering similar incentives _ cited rising
interest rates that have sapped consumer demand and slowed sales as
prompting its stepped-up program.
   Robert Rewey, Ford's North American sales vice president, said
vehicle sales during the first 80 days of 1989 fell below
expectations and Ford was lowering its prediction for industrywide
car and light truck sales to about 15 million from the previous
15.4 million.
   ``People still want to buy cars and trucks, (but) there may be
some hesitation,'' Rewey said.
   Part of that hesitation stemmed from the recent rise in interest
rates set by the Federal Reserve and banks. Banks have boosted
their prime lending rate _ used as a benchmark on a range of
consumer and business loans _ to 11.5 percent from 10.5 percent at
the first of the year.
   The banks have boosted their rates in response to interest rate
pressure by the Fed, which is attempting to curb inflation by
tightening credit.
   Rising rates have ratcheted up house payments for people with
adjustable-rate mortgages, causing a slowing in consumer spending
for durable goods such as cars and trucks, Rewey said.
   ``There has to be concern of the very rampant move of interest
rates in the first quarter'' of this year, he said.
   ``We believe the Federal Reserve actions have generated what
they wanted to generate,'' he said.
   Vehicle sales between Jan. 1 and March 20 this year by the eight
companies making cars in North America were 5.4 percent behind last
year's pace. Automobile sales were off 8.2 percent and truck sales
were 0.3 percent lower than in the year-earlier period.
   U.S. sales during the first 80 days of the year have been
running at an annual rate of about 14.6 million vehicles, Rewey
said. Typically, March and April are big buying months as Americans
prepare for the summertime driving season.
   Automakers and analysts have said since late last year they
expected sales to decline from 1988, the second-best ever. But
there has been concern on Wall Street that recent sales figures
were lower than anticipated.
   ``It's not surprising given that the 20-day (sales) numbers for
March do not look good,'' said analyst Jeannette Garretty of the
Bank of America in San Francisco. ``This first quarter is showing
up very weak.''
   Incentives cut directly into profits and analysts are reviewing
Ford's earnings picture.
   ``My guess is that it may prevent Ford's first-quarter earnings
from being higher than last year's,'' said David Healy of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. of New York. ``They could be down about 10
percent.''
   But Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, said
Ford's financial strength overseas would cancel out lower profits
in North America.
   ``There are offsets to the costs of these incentive programs,''
he said. ``So we may not see a significant reduction in earnings in
the first quarter. I'm not going to change my numbers.''
   Wall Street also has been concerned that the industry's vehicle
inventories have been running higher than anticipated. Ward's
Automotive Reports, a weekly industry publication, said that by the
end of February there was an 78-day supply of cars on dealer lots.
   Ford's car inventory stood at 82 days on March 20 and truck
inventory was 76 days, Rewey said, virtually the same since the
first of the year.

<HEAD>Gasoline, Crude Oil Rise; Nearby Heating Oil Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline and crude oil futures prices spurted
ahead Wednesday while wholesale home heating oil slid back slightly.
   The contract for May delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, recovered nearly half of the amount
lost in Tuesday's selloff.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May WTI contract ended
the session at $20.20 a barrel, up 29 cents from Tuesday's
settlement. On Tuesday, the May crude oil contract shed 62 cents
from Monday's closing level.
   Prices were bid up in the energy pits Monday as traders weighed
the implications of an oil spill off the Alaskan port of Valdez,
which caused the temporary closure of the port, reducing U.S. crude
supplies for a time.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
unleaded gasoline for April delivery rose 1.50 cents, settling at
60.18 cents a gallon. The April heating oil contract finished off
0.42 cent, at 54.62 cents a gallon, but contracts for May, June and
July delivery all posted gains.
   John H. O'Connell, a senior energy analyst at Refco Inc., said
energy futures weakened in the early going Wednesday and then
gained fresh upward momentum, mainly because of buying in the
gasoline pits.
   ``Everybody's in love with gasoline,'' said O'Connell.
   Traders have been buying gasoline in recent weeks amid
speculation that supplies could be tight this summer in the
Northeast if refiners in the region are required to alter their
methods. Gasoline refining changes which would cut
pollution-causing emissions have been proposed in a plan aimed at
reducing smog in the Northeastern states.
   O'Connell said some of the gasoline buying Wednesday may have
been caused by a change in the New York Mercantile Exchange's
contract specifications. The exchange made the change to comply
with recently altered industry practices.
   Meanwhile, crude oil buying may have been spurred by indications
that the OPEC countries are in no hurry to establish higher crude
production levels.
   An OPEC monitoring committee met Wednesday in Vienna, Austria to
formally review the cartel's price-boosting strategy.
   Subroto, secretary-general of the 13-nation Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the eight panel members
discussed a range of topics in the four-hour, closed-door meeting
but he refused to elaborate.
   ``The function of the committee is to review prices and to
review (production) quotas,'' he said. ``...We are not going to
make any decision.''

   A California company can pursue its $970 million
bid for Prime Computer Inc. once details of investment banker
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s financial role are disclosed, a
federal appeals court ruled Wednesday.
   The 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court
ruling blocking the takeover bid by MAI Basic Four Inc. on grounds
that Drexel's role in the deal made it a co-bidder.
   But the appeals court said an injunction against the bid issued
in December would be lifted after Tustin, Calif.-based MAI Basic
makes specific disclosures to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The decision requires MAI Basic to provide Drexel financial
statements, records of recent stock trading activity and
identification of all Drexel-affiliated officers and directors.
   MAI Basic President William B. Patton said the company would
work with Drexel to comply with the court guidelines and disclose
all pertinent documents.
   MAI Basic has offered $20 a share for Natick-based Prime, which
is four times the size of its suitor.
   But Patton said legal infighting could prove moot after Prime
shareholders hold their annual meeting May 12.
   ``The whole thing is going to come down to a proxy fight
anyway,'' he said. ``We've applied to the SEC for approval and
we're expecting it any day. After that, the court actions become
nothing more than legal jostling.''
   Prime spokesman Joe Gavaghan said the appeals court ruling
affirmed the company's position that stockholders need additional
information before deciding on the takeover.
   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone last month continued his
order blocking MAI's bid while asking for additional information
about how Drexel would finance the deal.
   In January, MAI Basic said the Wall Street firm was confident it
could raise $875 million to finance the takeover despite its guilty
plea in a massive securities fraud settlement.

   Sugar futures prices bounced back from recent lows in active

   On other markets, most energy futures advanced; gold and silver
futures retreated; grains and soybeans were mixed; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Sugar settled .50 cent to .89 cent higher on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for delivery in May at
12.20 cents a pound.
   The rally erased nearly all the losses that had followed last
week's statements by the Soviet Union that it had bought all the
sugar it needed for this year.
   Analysts noted some signs Wednesday that Moscow may be planning
further sugar purchases despite its statements to the contrary.
   But the main impetus for the runup was heavy buying by the
French trade house Sucres et Denrees, which was believed to be
scrambling for supplies because it had agreed to return to Cuba
150,000 metric tons of sugar for redelivery to the Soviet Union.
   ``The possible cause is that Russia put pressure on (Cuba) and
they had to fulfill their commitment to Russia,'' said Eric
Dunlaevy, a sugar trader with Balfour Maclaine Corp. in New York.
``Cuba might have said to the trade house something like, `We owe
you sugar. Can we have it back and repay you in 1990?'''
   Cuba, the world's fourth-largest sugar producer, has
overcommitted itself on sugar sales for the past two or three
years, analysts said.
   ``They are committed to ship 4.2 million tons to the Soviets
this year and they have to say, `What commitment do we meet, that
commitment or our commitment to the trade houses?''' said analyst
Kim Badenhop of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.
   ``This indicates they are going to try to meet their commitments
to the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Crude oil futures rose moderately on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after a day of volatile activity linked to concerns about
the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska and an OPEC monitoring
committee meeting in Vienna, Austria.
   Heating oil futures finished mixed but gasoline prices rose
sharply in reaction to an American Petroleum Institute report
showing a larger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. gasoline stocks
last week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude settled 26 cents to 37 cents
higher with May at $20.20 a barrel; heating oil was .42 cent lower
to .44 cent higher with April at 54.62 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .65 cent to 1.59 cent higher with April at 60.18 cents
a gallon.
   Gold futures fell slightly while silver posted steeper losses on
New York's Commodity Exchange as inflation fears continued to ease
following the Commerce Department's report of a 0.3 percent decline
in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators.
   Gold settled unchanged to $1.30 lower with April at $383.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.6 cents to 5.8 cents lower with May at
$5.808 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures finished little changed in a quiet
session on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Trading activity has slowed ahead of Friday's USDA quarterly
grain stocks report and annual spring planting estimate.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to 1 cent higher with May at $4.28\ a
bushel; corn was { cent to 2 cents lower with May at $2.73\ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to \ cent higher with May at $1.97 a
bushel; soybeans were 1} cents to 5 cents lower with May at $7.61 a
bushel.
   Reports of stronger spot markets boosted live cattle futures on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange; trading in pork futures was
cautious ahead of Friday's quarterly USDA hogs and pigs report.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .75 cent higher with April at
78.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .25 cent
higher with April at 81.70 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent lower
to .08 cent higher with April at 41.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .12 cent lower to .35 cent higher with May at 38.37
cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   The dollar lost some ground in choppy domestic
trading Wednesday after rising in foreign exchange trading overseas.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid of $381.80 for a troy ounce of gold at 4 p.m.
EST, compared with $383.00 late Tuesday.
   The dollar closed higher in Europe and remained relatively
strong when dealing shifted to New York. Traders noted that
activity had slowed to a trickle in the afternoon and that buying
was mostly speculative in nature.
   ``The dollar has made a key surge to the upside and is now
beginning to stabilize,'' said Jack Barbanel, a senior vice
president at Gruntal &amp; Co.
   Traders believe that there is still room for interest rates to
move higher, despite a spate of recent government statistics
showing the economy may be cooling down. Higher interest rates
support the dollar by making dollar-denominated securities more
attractive.
   The major central banks, with the exception of the influential
Bank of Japan, tried to depress the dollar by selling the currency,
but analysts noted that their effort was restrained.
   While the central banks want to make their presence known, ``one
gets the impression that they are not willing to really turn the
market around at this stage,'' said Steve Leach, a currency analyst
at Chemical Bank.
   Feeding that sentiment were comments by Michael Boskin, chairman
of the Council of Economic Advisers, who indicated the dollar
remains at competitive levels for U.S. manufacturers despite its
rise this week to seven-month highs.
   Also underlying the bullish mood is anticipation of hefty dollar
buying from Japan, where the fiscal year is about to end and where
a plethora of 10-year bonds are coming due, thereby freeing up a
substantial amount of cash that could be invested in U.S.
securities.
   There is some fear, however, that ``if the market keeps pushing
the dollar higher, the central banks may respond more
aggressively,'' Leach said.
   Traders said there was little reaction to a Commerce Department
report showing the government's chief economic forecasting gauge
dropped 0.3 percent in February after gaining sharply in the
previous two months. The decline had been expected.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 133.25 Japanese yen, up from
132.30. Later in London, it traded at 132.73 yen. In New York, the
dollar rose to 133.12 yen, from 133.10 yen Tuesday.
   The British pound fell after government figures showed British
imports continued to grow faster than exports. Britain's current
account deficit totaled $2.88 billion in February, higher than the
$2.47 billion deficit analysts had forecast.
   The pound has lost nearly 9.5 cents against the dollar since
mid-February. One British pound cost $1.6870 in London late
Wednesday, cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's $1.7030. In New York
it cost $1.6875 to buy one pound, more expensive than Wednesday's
$1.6855.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.8935 West German marks, down from 1.8953; 1.6513 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6533; 6.3905 French francs, down from 6.4010;
1,389.00 Italian lire, up from 1,379.50, and 1.1942 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1952.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.8910 West German marks, up from 1.8850; 1.6490
Swiss francs, up from 1.6415; 6.3800 French francs, up from 6.3625;
2.1315 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1215; 1,385.65 Italian lire, up
from 1,379.50, and 1.1935 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1925.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. But on the Commodity Exchange in
New York, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $383.30 a
troy ounce, up from $383 on Tuesday.
   Gold closed in London at a bid price of $382.75 a troy ounce,
down from $387.50. The closing bid price in Zurich was $381.75,
down from $388.00. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $383.55 an
ounce, down from $391.35.
   Silver also fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery finished at $5.758 a troy ounce, down from
Tuesday's settlement of $5.794. Earlier in London, silver traded at
a bid $5.78 a troy ounce, down from $5.91.

   Stock prices notched a third consecutive gain
Wednesday in light trading with the help of a late rally in the
bond market.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.98 to 2,281.52,
bringing its gain so far this week to more than 37 points.
   ``I've not seen too many markets where there's been less
enthusiasm about it than in the last three days of this rally,''
said Gordon Smith, a trader at Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in Baltimore.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declining ones in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
741 up, 658 down and 561 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 144.24 million
shares, down from 146.42 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 170.94 million shares.
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down most of the afternoon
but rose in tandem with a rally in the bond market as program
buying kicked in. The Treasury's long bond, up just 1-32 point
around midday, finished the day with a gain of 19-32 point, or
nearly $6 per $1,000 in face value.
   The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators
fell 0.3 percent in February, but the figure fell in line with
expectations and had little impact on the stock market.
   Trading remained fairly light, although not as light as Monday,
when a slow comeback from the Easter holiday led to the slowest day
of 1989. Slightly less than 113 million shares were traded on the
exchange floor that day.
   Investors remained cautious in spite of the week's recovery,
traders said.
   ``Every time it seems like a little stability comes back into
it, something goes way out of whack,'' said Gene Hill, a trader at
Eppler, Guerin &amp; Turner Inc. in Dallas.
   Among stocks in the news, Unisys rose | to 25} even though it
announced it expected a loss of $60 million to $80 million in the
first quarter.
   SmithKline Beckman rose 2 to 54}. The Philadelphia Inquirer said

   Eastern Airlines, seeking to lure passengers scared
off by a four-week strike, has expanded an on-time guarantee for
Northeast travelers and offered a $25 gift check for all passengers
on the Eastern shuttle and on 14 non-stop flights between
Washington and Boston.
   The airline announced Wednesday that, beginning April 3, all
travelers flying Eastern between Boston and Washington will have
the price of their tickets refunded if their flight departs more
than five minutes late. The passengers will receive a $25 American
Express check just for flying Eastern on those routes.
   Both the on-time and American Express offers on the shuttle and
non-stop flights between Boston and Washington will be good until
April 30, the airline said. The carrier also discounted the
non-stop Boston-Washington flights for weekend travelers.
   Eastern was extending a shuttle on-time guarantee that started
March 20 and would have expired March 31, and expanding that
guarantee to the non-stop Boston-Washington flights.
   Cash or a charge-card credit will be offered to any passenger
who qualifies for the refund. Or the customer can choose to receive
a free one-way ticket on the same route for future travel.
   The incentives are a direct response to disappointing passenger
loads on the shuttle and union activity designed to keep passengers
off the once-proud commuter line Eastern runs between Washington,
New York and Boston.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said Eastern's passenger loads
have been running less than half of the pre-strike levels on many
of the 120-passenger DC-9 planes that make the 60 to 62 shutttle
flights each day. Less than 10 percent of the flights use Boeing
727s with a capacity of 177 passengers.
   Ashlock conceded that union strategies to keep people away from
Eastern have had an effect. He said picket activity by the
Machinists and pilots in Boston and New York has contributed to the
reluctance of passengers to fly the shuttle.
   Ashlock said passenger loads on the San Juan, Puerto Rico, and
Latin American flights have been stronger, but the incentives are
needed to bolster the shuttle, which accounts for more than half of
the carrier's approximate 105 to 110 flights each day.
   The airline also said it is offering a special $98 weekend
round-trip discount fare on Boston-Washington flights during the
month of April.
   Previously, the fare ranged from $238 to $368 depending on how
early the ticket is bought.
   Passengers must complete both flight segments between Saturday
and Sunday of the same weekend. The carrier offers 14 round trips
daily between the two cities.

<HEAD>Real Estate Loans Could Not Isolate MCorp From Trouble, Analysts
Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas' energy-wrecked economy doomed MCorp despite
the bank holding company's focus on real estate instead of energy
loans, analysts said Wednesday after regulators seized control of
most of the bank holding company.
   ``Once Texas real estate markets began to slip, there really was
very little they could do,'' said banking analyst Michael Starr at
Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Chicago. ``What you're seeing in the real
estate market is simply what started a decade ago in energy
problems. ... MCorp is at the tail-end of feeling those problems.''
   Twenty of MCorp's 25 banks, including the two largest in Dallas
and Houston, were declared insolvent late Tuesday and early
Wednesday, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took over
management under a newly chartered, federally owned Deposit
Insurance Bridge Bank NA while regulators look for a buyer for some
or all of the banks.
   The FDIC pumped $300 million into the banks, but officials would
not say how much government aid ultimately will be required.
Analysts have said the price tag could run between $1 billion and
$2 billion.
   While it was the soft real estate market _ MCorp's own 60-story
tower in downtown Dallas is only about 60 percent rented _ that
undercut the bank, a move late last week began the final tumble.
   S.N. Phelps &amp; Co., a Connecticutt bond-trading firm, and two of
its employees, sought to force MCorp into bankruptcy because it had
not made payments on a little more than $2 million in bonds they
held.
   MCorp had suspended payment last October on about $470 million
in bonds and preferred stock.
   MCorp on Monday said it would seek protection instead from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code.
   The resulting uncertainty apparently set off a run on deposits.
   Federal regulators, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
between $50 million and $100 million was withdrawn Tuesday from
MBank Dallas, the firm's lead institution. The withdrawals came
both from individual depositors and some of MCorp's other
subsidiary banks, the regulators said.
   The Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said Wednesday the FDIC told
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency it would no longer
provide open assistance to MCorp.
   ``The OCC then advised the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas that
under these circumstances, they did not consider MCorp a viable
financial institution,'' according to a statement from the Dallas
Fed. ``Therefore, Tuesday, March 28, 1989, the Dallas Fed called
MCorp's loan.''
   The Dallas Fed would not reveal the size of MCorp's loan, but
figures from the central bank's statement of condition indicate
that loans from the Dallas branch have gone from $778 million on
Jan. 26 to $1.23 billion on March 23.
   MCorp is the latest large bank rescue in Texas, although other
institutions _ notably Texas American Bancshares Inc. of Fort Worth
and National Bancshares Corp. of Texas Inc. in San Antonio _ have
asked for federal assistance and word could come at any time on the
resolution of those problems.
   Earlier this decade, the Texas economy was booming on
projections of $50-per-barrel oil and that optimism spread to
developers who rushed to put up project after project, some on
flimsy or non-existent demand, according to experts.
   A recent survey of real estate owners and developers found 89
percent who ``strongly agreed'' or ``somewhat agreed'' that the
Dallas-Fort Worth market is overbuilt.
   In its third-quarter report to stockholders, MCorp said, ``Asset
quality problems, largely releated to loans secured by real estate
and assets acquired upon foreclosure, adversely affected the
company's financial performance.''
   The bank reported a third-quarter loss of $517 million, and the
FDIC says MCorp's 25 banks lost $213 million in the fourth quarter
and $903 million for the entire year.
   MCorp has yet to release full financial results for the quarter
and year.
   ``The straightforward, honest answer is that the state of Texas
was hit by an economic H-bomb that had effects on real estate
portfolios, energy portfolios, international portfolios and
domestic portfolios,'' said Robert D. Rieke, a banking analyst with
the Dallas firm of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc.
   ``To its tribute, MCorp has been able to withstand the fallout
longer than anybody else,'' said Rieke, once a vice-president and
treasurer at MCorp.
   Oil prices dropped rather than rose in the mid-1980s and the
impact hit Houston first and later the Dallas economy.
   Duff &amp; Phelps' Starr said MCorp probably was guilty of some
``overaggressive lending,'' but not to the extent of some other
Texas banks, and most of its loans were to largely reputable
developers.
   MCorp Chairman Gene Bishop, who had attempted to put together a
private recapitalization plan, said Wednesday the five banks left
``form the nucleus of a new beginning for MCorp.''
   But neither Rieke nor Starr expect that effort to be successful.

<HEAD>IMF Lends $442 Million to Venezuela</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund announced on
Wednesday a loan of $442 million to Venezuela, where riots linked
to its debt situation killed at least 300 people last month.
   Venezuela owes about $32 billion but this is its first borrowing
from the fund. The fund has 151 member countries, including
Venezuela.
   The loan is repayable in five years with interest at 7.38
percent, considerably less than current rates for bank loans. The
fund's announcement said that Venezuela is expected to make
additional requests for its loans, and to seek credit from other
international bodies and commercial banks.
   This loan can be disbursed immediately. It will enable Venezuela
to repay a short-term $450 million loan from the United States,
announced March 10, soon after the riots.
   Later credits from the fund would be disbursed periodically
subject to ``performance criteria'' such as reductions in
Venezuelan government spending.
   The new government of President Carlos Andres Perez made policy
changes last month similar to those the fund prescribes for
countries seeking help with their debts. They included lowering
subsidies on food and gasoline. Prices of food and bus fares rose.
   Protests in Caracas turned into riots just as ministers from the
Perez government were in Washington to sign the ``letter of
intent'' needed to get the fund's support.

<HEAD>Maalox Maker Sues Pepto-Bismol Maker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The maker of Maalox is suing the maker of
Pepto-Bismol in a battle between stomach remedies.
   Rorer Pharmaceutical Corp. of Fort Washington, Pa., contends in
the suit filed in federal court in New York that Pepto-Bismol's
labeling, advertising and promotion are ``false and misleading.''
   In its suit, Rorer contends ``sweeping,'' unsubstantiated
statements by Pepto-Bismol's maker, Procter &amp; Gamble Co., have hurt
the sales and reputation of Maalox, Rorer's 40-year-old antacid.
   Rorer officials declined to estimate how much money they have
lost in sales, but the suit calls the sum ``substantial.''
   Teri Glover, a spokeswoman at Procter &amp; Gamble's headquarters in
Cincinnati, said the company had not seen the court papers and
could not comment.
   Procter &amp; Gamble acquired 88-year-old Pepto-Bismol in 1982 when
it bought Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, which also is named as a
defendant in the suit.
   Rorer's suit also alleges that a new Maximum Strength
Pepto-Bismol is being sold with a higher dosage than approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   In addition, Rorer said, it is disturbed that Procter &amp; Gamble
contends Pepto-Bismol treats a host of ailments, including
heartburn, indigestion, nausea and upset stomach.
   Rorer contends Pepto-Bismol is effective against only heartburn,
fullness and nausea caused specifically by overindulgence in food
and alcohol.
   ``The FDA has specifically found that Pepto-Bismol is not
effective for most of the claims for which it is promoted,'' said
the suit, filed Thursday.
   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said the agency had no comment on
the suit.
   The Maalox line of over-the-counter antacids is the best-selling
antacid in the nation and the world. It had U.S. sales exceeding
$105 million last year, giving it about 15 percent of the market
for antacids, said Richard Driansky, a vice president and chief
counsel for Rorer, a division of Rorer Group Inc.

<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. said Wednesday it
will begin selling leading models of its computer workstations
through the nation's two largest industrial distributors, a move
reflecting the falling prices of the machines throughout the
industry.
   The company said it has signed distribution agreements with
Schweber Electronics and Hall-Mark Electronics Corp. to sell some
models of its HP 9000 Series 300, which adheres to AT&amp;T's Unix
System V Interface Definition Issue 2.
   Digital Equipment Corp. has been offering its mid-sized
workstations through industrial distributors for some time, and
Hewlett-Packard's strategy represents an industry trend needed
because prices of the computers have become dramatically cheaper in
recent years, said technology analyst Adam Cuhney at Kidder Peabody
&amp; Co.
   ``It is simply not very appropriate any longer because of how
affordable these machines have become to devote the resources of a
direct sales force to selling them,'' Cuhney added.
   New York-based Schweber, part of the LEX Electronics Company,
has 39 U.S. locations and 408 sales representatives. Hall-Mark,
based in Dallas, has 35 U.S. locations and 170 sales
representatives.
   ``Entry-level workstations have dropped to less than $5,000, so
many small- and medium-sized companies now can afford workstations
for engineering, design and commercial applications,'' said Richard
C. Watts, director of marketing for HP's computer products division.
   Watts said the distribution agreements will allow HP's direct
sales force to concentrate on Fortune 1000 companies.
   The worldwide market for general purpose and technical
workstations _ high-powered desktop computers that range in cost up
to $80,000 _ is estimated at $4 billion and growing rapidly. Such
machines give desktop users vastly improved abilities over standard
personal computers, particularly in visual displays, speed and
mathematical calculations.
   HP has been selling workstations in Britain through industrial
distributors for the last 18 months.

   The leader of Northwest Airlines' largest
union said Wednesday he would vigorously resist if someone succeeds
in buying the airline with the intent of breaking it up.
   ``Our message to any potential buyer is very clear,'' said Guy
Cook, chairman of International Association of Machinists District
Lodge 143. ``If there is an indication on their part there will be
a breakup, there's going to be all-out war on this airline.''
   Cook said management at Northwest would not disclose to him the
identity of the investment group that the company says is
interested in acquiring the airline.
   Northwest parent NWA Inc. on Tuesday said the investment group
holds 4.9 percent of the company's 29.1 million shares and has
shown an interest in a ``negotiated leveraged acquisition.''
   The airline, which has vowed to remain independent, wouldn't say
whether the group has made a formal purchase proposal and the group
has not made its intentions public.
   Cook, whose union represents nearly two-thirds of Northwest's
35,000 employees, said he suspects the investment group would have
to borrow a lot of money to buy Northwest. To repay debts of the
leveraged buyout, the new owners would probably sell some of the
company's assets and eliminate some jobs, he said.
   If a hostile takeover artist threatens to break up the airline,
Cook said the unions would consider their own takeover of
Northwest. He said the unions could possibly outbid a hostile
suitor by agreeing to contract concessions as part of their own
leveraged buyout.
   A spokewoman for Teamsters Local 2747, which represents about
7,000 Northwest flight attendants, said the union would not comment
on the situation.
   Officials at the Air Line Pilots Association, which represents
about 5,000 Northwest pilots, did not return phone calls Wednesday.

   CFM International, a joint venture of
General Electric Co. and the French manufacturer SNECMA, announced
Wednesday that it has negotiated a $1 billion contract to supply
USAir with as many as 250 CFM56-3 model jet engines.
   CFM International, which is based in this Cincinnati suburb,
said the $1 billion supply agreement is the largest in the 10 years
since it began selling jet engines.
   The CFM56-3 is used in the Boeing 737-300, 737-400 and 737-500
series of jet aircraft. USAir and Piedmont Airlines, which are
customers for the 737-300 and 737-400 aircraft respectively, have
options on orders for 120 Boeing 737 jets to be delivered from 1991
through 1995.
   Both airlines are subsidiaries of USAir Group and are to be
merged on Aug. 5. USAir and Piedmont have ordered or taken delivery
on a total of 165 of the 737-300 and 737-400 jets, officials said.
USAir is CFM International's largest commercial customer.
   Since entering commercial service in late 1984, the CFM56-3
engine has logged more than 6 million flight hours.

<TEXT>
   Four companies' plans to offer shareholders a
chance to exchange up to $5.6 billion in stock for new financial
instruments called unbundled stock units have come unraveled.
   American Express Co., Dow Chemical Co., Pfizer Inc. joined Sara
Lee Corp. in saying Wednesday they wouldn't proceed with plans to
offer to exchange up to 20 percent of their common stock for the
unbundled units, called USUs.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the prices of all
four companies' stocks rose. American Express rose 25 cents a share
to $31.12{, Pfizer rose 62{ cents a share to $57.12{, Dow Chemical
was up $1.25 a share at $90.87{ and Sara Lee was up 62{ cents a
share at $48.
   The company decisions came a day after their underwriter and the
inventor of the new securities, Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
advised them that the Securities and Exchange Commission staff
objected to an accounting treatment that Shearson said was an
important motivation for making the exchange.
   Shearson said the SEC staff believed the new securities should
be counted among total shares outstanding in determining a
company's earnings per share.
   That ruling would frustrate a key motivation for a company to
offer the exchange _ reducing the amount of its common stock
outstanding and thereby boosting earnings per share.
   Shearson said it therefore would recommend that the four
companies withdraw the planned offering of USUs and all four agreed.
   Under Shearson's plan, each USU would consist of a 30-year bond,
a preferred stock share and a stock appreciation certificate. The
three components could be traded separately, in combinations or as
a unit.
   Shearson said the exchange would give companies a way to reduce
the amount of stock they have outstanding without taking on a big
debt load as would be required with normal stock buybacks or
restructuring.
   The firm felt it could also help boost stock prices by calling
attention to the reasons people buy stock _ the dividend, the
chance that the dividend will be raised and the hope that the stock
price will rise _ and by possibly helping to actually lift its
stock price.
   ``While we believe this innovative plan would have created
excellent value for our stockholders, we will aggressively pursue
other attractive financial concepts that offer us opportunities to
create shareholder wealth,'' John H. Bryan Jr., Sara Lee's chairman
and chief executive, said in a statement released late Tuesday.
   Howard L. Clark Jr., chief financial officer for American
Express, said, ``We are disappointed that we will not be able to
incorporate this new financial instrument into our stock repurchase
program.''
   ``At the same time, we applaud the innovative, creative efforts
that Shearson put into the project,'' he said.
   American Express owns 70.5 percent of Shearson's outstanding
stock.
   The companies on Dec. 5 each filed their plans to make the
exchange and the SEC staff has been reviewing those plans.
   Brokerage industry analysts said that while industry followers
admired Shearson's creativity in creating the USU, many
institutional investors were skeptical about the plan.
   Some investors didn't like the idea that USUs would carry no
voting rights. Others questioned whether there would be enough USUs
in circulation to create a liquid market. And others were skeptical
that the market price for the USU would match or exceed that for
the common stock.
   Nonetheless, Ron Gallatin, the Shearson managing director who
oversaw development of the USU concept, said he was confident there
would have been enough institutions interested in making the swap
that the ``exchange would have been successful.''

   American officials are uncertain whether an
accord will be reached by the Japanese-set Friday deadline for a
controversial jet fighter the two countries hope to build together,
the White House said Wednesday.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the delay in
reaching an accord to build the controversial FSX fighter is
directly due to President Bush's insistence on safeguards to
protect U.S. technology.
   ``We don't know. We'll take it a day at a time,'' Fitzwater told
reporters when asked if the Friday deadline would be met.
   ``It's not a hard and fast, drop-dead deadline, either. We'll do
the best we can,'' Fitzwater said.
   The Japanese government claims the agreement must be nailed down
by Friday so that money for it can be included in its budget for
the upcoming Japanese fiscal year, which begins April 1.
   ``We still can't put a timetable on it,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said talks were still progressing at ``other levels'' even
though Japan's chief negotiator on the project returned on Tuesday
to Tokyo.
   ``The president's proposal and position on it has remaind rather
firm through all of this, which is one of the reasons why it's
taking so long,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush has said he supports the project, negotiated by the Reagan
administration, but only with certain conditions. Under the plan,
General Dynamics and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries would
jointly build the new plane, to be modeled after the American-made
F-16 fighter.
   In Tokyo, an official for Japan's Defense Agency said Wednesday
the Japanese government would sign a contract with Mitsubishi for
development of the fighter jet, despite the continuing negotiations.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
government would sign the contract on Thursday or Friday for
development of the FSX even if the two countries do not reach a
final agreement on the project by then.
   Takaaki Yamada, vice president of Mitsubishi's aircraft
division, said the Defense Agency's decision to sign the contract
was ``a step forward in the FSX joint development project.''
   A group of 43 legislators from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic
Party said Japan might want to build the aircraft on its own.
   The legislators presented a petition to the government urging
that it proceed with development of the fighter, with or without
U.S. help.
   Japanese opponents have argued that Tokyo should scrap the
accord and go ahead with its original plan to develop the jet on
its own.
   Among the outstanding disputes are questions over who owns the
technology that emerges from the project, how many of the fighters
would be built in the United States, and how to protect
sophisticated U.S. computer software used to fly and control the
plane.
   ``I'm told there are pieces of those issues that are still
unresolved,'' Fitzwater said.

   Four opposition parties opened talks on Wednesday
about forming a coalition government they hope may replace the
scandal-ridden Cabinet of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose
popularity has nose-dived.
   The mass circulation newspaper Mainichi Shimbun reported
Wednesday that only 9 percent of those responding to its poll
supported Takeshita, the lowest rating since the newspaper began
such surveys in 1947.
   In Mainichi's last poll in December, support for Takeshita stood
at 18 percent.
   The newspaper linked the sharp drop to a widening
stock-profiteering scandal involving influential politicians,
bureaucrats and businessmen, and to a new 3 percent sales tax that
goes into effect on Saturday.
   Takeshita has rejected opposition demands that he resign and let
the public give its verdict in new elections. After the latest
polls, he reiterated a vow to push through political reforms to
restore public trust in government.
   Elections for half the seats in the upper house of Parliament
are due this summer. A serious setback could cost Takeshita his
leadership of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and
consequently his position as prime minister.
   Although the Liberal Democrats control both houses of
Parliament, opposition party secretary-generals agreed Wednesday
their party chiefs should meet next week to discuss details of a
coalition government.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist
Party, said the four parties agreed to give 11 of 22 Cabinet posts
to the Socialists, including the prime minister's position. If the
coalition came to power, Japan might have its first woman prime
minister _ Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Socialists, the largest
opposition party.
   Others in the coalition would come from the Komeito (Clean
Government Party), Democratic Socialist and United Social
Democratic parties.
   The opposition agreed to keep pressuring the government to force
Yasuhiro Nakasone to testimony in parliament. He was prime minister
at the time of stock transactions now being probed in the so-called
Recruit scandal.
   Government refusal to summon Nakasone led to an opposition
boycott that has halted debate in parliament on the budget for
fiscal 1989, which begins Saturday.
   Recruit Co., an information conglomerate, sold bargain-price
unlisted shares in a subsidiary to about 150 influential figures,
who profited when the shares soared in value after public sales
began.
   Prosecutors have arrested 13 people on bribery and other charges
in the scandal, including two former high-ranking government
officials.
   Three Cabinet ministers resigned in connection with the scandal,
and 17 politicians, including Nakasone and Takeshita, were linked
to the stock deals.
   Mainichi said in reporting its record low popularity rating for
Takeshita that it polled 2,257 adults in interviews March 24-26.

<HEAD>Dollar Inches Down, Share Prices Fall</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar inched down against the Japanese
yen after opening higher Thursday morning, while share prices fell
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar, which started at 133.27 yen, up 0.02 yen from
Wednesday's finish, was changing hands at 133.05 yen at late
morning. The currency moved in a range of 133.05-133.30 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which rose
430.92 points Wednesday to a record high of 32,737.28 points, shed
74.05 points, or 0.23 percent, to finish morning trading at
32,663.23.
   The market's key index started higher following an upward trend
of the last two days, but it reversed course as speculative
investors began selling issues for profit taking, said a dealer
with a major securities firm in Tokyo, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Another dealer said some participants sold the Nikkei's spot
issues to buy cheaper issues in the futures market to collect
profits, which further pushed the prices lower.
   In currency dealings, the dollar started almost unchanged from
the previous day's closing, following a similar trend in New York
overnight after the concerted dollar-selling intervention by the
U.S. and European central banks, dealers said.
   In New York, the dollar closed at 133.15 yen Wednesday, just
0.02 yen lower from the previous day's closing.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar ``moved little''
as the close of the fiscal year for many Japanese businesses
neared. Japan's fiscal year begins April 1.
   The uptrend of the U.S. currency was eased as many Japanese
market players slowed down their dollar-buying ahead of the
upcoming ``Group of Seven'' meeting among officials of major
industrialized nations, including the United States, Britain and
France, other dealers said. The meeting will be held in Washington
on Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Desperate fishermen in a fleet of small
boats Wednesday fought the nation's worst oil spill with booms,
rakes and shovels, while state officials launched a criminal
investigation into the disaster.
   Meanwhile, a harbor pilot and Coast Guard official told
investigators they smelled alcohol on the breath of the tanker's
captain before and after the vessel ran aground Friday in Prince
William Sound, a federal official said.
   But both agreed that Exxon Valdez Capt. Joseph Hazelwood
appeared competent, said William Woody, chief of the four-man
National Transportation Safety Board team assigned to the disaster.
   As the 10.1 million-gallon spill spread over more than 500
square miles, a former top port official charged that cutbacks had
left operators of the Port of Valdez with ill-maintained booms, no
barge to take on oil and virtually no properly trained people to
respond to the disaster.
   At least 40 people and five fishing boats were sent to protect
one of the world's largest salmon hatcheries at Port San Juan.
Other vessels made a stand at Eshmay Bay and Main Bay.
   ``The spill is all over Prince William Sound,'' Gov. Steve
Cowper said. ``It is headed for Montague Strait.''
   Wind and currents have stretched the slick into ragged patches
of shifting irridescent oil on crystal blue water. The heavy goo
surrounds several islands _ gravel beaches and rocky points smeared
with a black band of oil.
   The strait is an outlet to the Gulf of Alaska, and Cowper said
that is where everyone hopes the oil goes, ``rather than bouncing
around like a pinball in Prince William Sound and polluting it for
years.''
   Once in the gulf, Cowper said, there is no way of telling where
the oil might go. If it continues southwest as it has, it could
jeopardize valuable fisheries around Kodiak.
   Valdez Mayor John Devens has estimated the loss to the fishing
industry at $150 million.
   Despite fears of immediate damage to the fisheries, some
officials warned the worst may yet lie ahead.
   ``This spill will devastate the ecosystem long after wildlife
that now has been exposed has died,'' said Jon Lyman, a spokesman
for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. He said thousands of
birds, including bald eagles, may die in the coming years. Nearly
100 birds have been caught in the oil already.
   The oil invading estuaries and coves is far worse than is being
described Exxon and other official sources, said Kathy Frost, a
marine mammal biologist.
   ``There are animals in the oil,'' she said. ``We don't know what
it will do with them. There have been few experiments. Now it's
happening in real life.''
   Meanwhile, Exxon officials said they hoped to finish unloading
the stricken tanker by Friday. Exxon spokesman Don Cornett said
390,000 of the 1 million barrels that were left on board after the
spill had been pumped into the tanker Exxon Baton Rouge.
   Deputy Attorney General Ron Lorenson arrived in Valdez, and said
he was conducting a criminal investigation.
   The only crewman willing to talk to investigators has been
Robert Kagan, who was at the helm, Woody said. He told
investigators he received a flurry of orders calling for hard turns
just before the tanker went on ``a bumpy ride.''
   Exxon officials said Hazelwood was not on the bridge when the
tanker struck a reef one-half mile outside of established shipping
lanes. Third mate Gregory Cousins was giving the orders.
   On the advice of their lawyers, Hazelwood and Cousins have
refused to talk to investigators, Woody said, delaying a public
inquiry by perhaps weeks.
   Hazelwood, who had his driver's license suspended because of a
drunken driving conviction, was given a blood-alcohol test after
the accident, but Woody said it may have been too late for the
results to be conclusive.
   Hazelwood's mother told The Associated Press that her son had a
history of alcohol abuse, and that Exxon was aware of it.
   Cowper told a team dispatched by President Bush that a federal
takeover of the effort was unnecessary.
   ``Now, I think we've got a command situation I think is going to
work,'' he said.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told Bush things were
more positive than they appeared earlier in the week, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Washington.
   Skinner, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Bill
Reilly and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost planned to return to
Washington on Thursday.
   Mayor Devens said his community felt ``a little betrayed'' by
the oil industry and its inability to clean up the mess as it had
promised.
   The Seattle Times reported in Wednesday's editions that the oil
industry consortium operating the Valdez port had cut back its oil
spill cleanup resources severely in recent years.
   The cutbacks prevented the consortium from acting quickly in the
early hours of the spill when it still might have been contained,
said James Woodle, retired Coast Guard commander and general
manager of the Port of Valdez from 1982 to 1984.
   ``You can't clean up everything in 48 hours,'' Woodle said.
``But you can contain it, and they could have done it with this one
if they had the manpower, the initial response.''
   Charles O'Donnell, superintendent of the marine terminal at
Valdez, said the consortium, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., was
operating under a plan approved by state and federal authorities.
