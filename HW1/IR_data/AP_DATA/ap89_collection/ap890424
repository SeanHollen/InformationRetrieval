   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita announced on
Tuesday that he will resign to take responsibility for a massive
influence-peddling scandal he said has led to growing public
distrust of politicians.
   The scandal and a widely criticized sales tax that took effect
April 1 sent his popularity rating skidding to a rock-bottom 3.9
percent and made him Japan's most unpopular prime minister since
World War II.
   Takeshita, 65, spoke at a nationally televised news conference
after telling a Cabinet meeting he would end his 18-month tenure in
office, half of it a downhill slide due to a scandal named after
the Recruit Co. conglomerate.
   ``The Recruit question has caused a grave crisis for the
nation's parliamentary democracy,'' he said. ``As the chief
executive of government and president of the ruling party, I deeply
apologize.''
   The prime minister said he will step down after the fiscal 1989
budget is passed. That leaves the timing of his resignation
uncertain because Parliament is deadlocked by an opposition boycott
of budget deliberations. Parliament is expected to pass the budget
by early May.
   It also was unclear who would succeed him since other senior
figures in the governing Liberal Democratic Party are tainted by
donations from Recruit.
   News reports cited former Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito as a
possible successor to Takeshita, but Ito is 75 and ailing. He is a
diabetic.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President
Bush in San Jose, Calif. said Tuesday night: ``Japan is a close
ally and friend. We will continue to work closely with the new
prime minister and government.''
   Takeshita became prime minister in November 1987. He denied
wrongdoing but acknowledged receiving more than $1 million in what
he called legal political donations from the Recruit Co. Weekend
news reports said he also borrowed $381,700 from the
information-publishing giant in 1987, returning the funds a few
months later.
   A former Takeshita aide and a relative also profited from sales
of the Recruit Cosmos shares for a total of $192,000.
   About 17 politicians or their aides and 150 other influential
people are known to have reaped profit from sales of hundreds of
thousands of unlisted shares in a Recruit real estate subsidiary,
Recruit Cosmos, in 1986. The transactions generated hefty profits
when the share prices soared after the stocks were made available
for over-the-counter trading.
   Recruit also paid millions of dollars to influential politicians
or their aides as contributions, raising suspicions it was seeking
favors in return.
   The chief Cabinet secretary, Reizo Obuchi, said in making the
first official announcement Tuesday that Takeshita would resign,
said Takeshita wanted ``to clarify his responsibility for the
public's distrust in politicians due to the Recruit question.''
   More than a dozen people have been arrested on bribery and other
charges, and three Takeshita-appointed Cabinet members have
resigned in connection with the scandal. Along with Takeshita,
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone; Shintaro Abe, the
secretary-general of the Liberal Democrats, and former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa have been implicated.
   Takeshita said Tuesday he would continue with a planned trip to
five Southeast Asian nations scheduled to start Saturday and
lasting through May 7. News reports earlier said he planned to
cancel the trip.
   After Takeshita's resignation, governing party members would
chose their next party president, who would in turn become prime
minister due to the Liberal Democrats' majority in both houses of
Parliament.
   Ito, chairman of the governing Liberal Democratic Party's
Executive Council and an eight-time member of the lower house, told
reporters who had gathered in front of his Tokyo residence before
Takeshita's announcement late Tuesday morning: ``This is the time
for fundamental political reform.''
   Ito and Takeshita met on Monday and afterward both denied
setting a plan for Ito to take over the premiership.
   A recent poll by the Kyodo News Service put Takeshita's support
at 3.9 percent, the lowest ever recorded by Kyodo for a prime
minister.
   Political analysts say that along with the scandal and low
popularity ratings, the premier has been pressed by dissent within
the party because younger party members fear they will not be able
to win elections with Takeshita as their leader.
   Elections for half the seats in the upper house are due this
summer, though general elections need not be called by the prime
minister until the summer of 1990.
   Media reports did not say if Takeshita might call for early
general elections or if the Liberal Democrats would pick a
successor.
   The Liberal Democrats have governed Japan for about 48 years and
hold 297 seats in the 512-member lower house of Parliament.
   Many of the Recruit donations to Takeshita and others were
ticket purchases to fund-raising parties. Such gatherings of fellow
politicians and business leaders are common in Japan, where
politics and business are closely related. They are especially
popular with the Liberal Democrats as a way around laws restricting
campaign funds.
   In recent weeks, Takeshita had repeatedly vowed to push through
political reforms to restore public trust in government.
   The scandal has caused the greatest political fallout in Japan
since former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka was accused in the
Lockheed affair in 1976. Tanaka was convicted of taking a $2
million bribe after the U.S. aircraft company admitted it spent
$12.1 million to advance its sales in Japan.

   A Shanghai man has been sentenced to die for
stealing money and goods from the U.S. consulate in his home city,
an official newspaper reported today.
   The Shanghai Intermediate People's Court on Saturday handed down
the death sentence to Zhang Ping for stealing 33,000 yuan ($8,900)
from the consulate, the China Daily said.
   Zhang broke into the consulate in China's largest city an
unspecified number of times between December 1986 and February
1988, it said.
   Zhang, also accused of stealing goods in other areas around
Shanghai, was arrested last May and confessed to his crimes, the
daily said. He had previously served a three-year prison term for
theft.
   Chinese courts generally hand down stiff sentences for any crime
against foreigners. The government has also called on courts to
deal harshly with criminals in the face of a nationwide rise in
crime.
   Shanghai courts handled 2,801 theft cases last year, up 22.5
percent over 1987, sentencing 12 convicted thiefs to death and 13
to life in prison.

   A small town library was set free from
budget woes when officials found an original copy of Abraham
Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation lying in a pile of junk.
   ``It was like a providential finding,'' said Maurice Isserman, a
trustee of the Ashfield public library and a professor of history
at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley.
   Isserman discovered the document last fall as trustees were
meeting to discuss the prospect of receiving state and federal
grants.
   ``Somebody said we could sell those old prints over there in the
corner,'' Isserman said. ``I walked over and looked at one and it
wasn't a print, it was a document and I looked down at the bottom
and there was Abraham Lincoln's signature which was faded a
different color from the printed material.''
   The document was one of 48 copies made in 1864 and signed by
Lincoln and Secretary of State William Seward, experts at Sotheby's
auction house in New York told trustees recently.
   Library officials believe the document was donated years ago by
George William Curtis, a friend of Lincoln's and a founder of the
Ashfield Library Association.
   The library received its grants, but they totaled about $50,000
less than officials expected. The three-room Belding Memorial
Library also needed renovations, Isserman said.
   So, the document will be auctioned next fall and is expected to
fetch at least $70,000, which should cover the renovations, he said.

   A Texas businessman has just the thing
for the jet lagged rhinoceros _ an airport VIP lounge for animals.
   Thomas C. Schooler is preparing to build the lounge at
Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. His first arrivals, a
party of 10 rare black rhinos, are scheduled to stop here June 16.
   The hulking visitors will be treated to a shower and sprayed for
harmful parasites before dining on a vegetarian meal. ``It's like a
big car wash,'' Schooler said of the shower.
   Schooler has operated a similar rest stop in Houston for three
years. He also has helped an entire rodeo make a worldwide tour and
recently shipped a circus.
   Although construction won't start until next month, Schooler
already is doing business in Dallas-Fort Worth.
   ``I bring truckloads of animals up here to make connections with
Japan Airlines or American,'' he said. ``Last night, 2,000 chickens
came in and are going out this morning.''
   The Animal-Port, which will occupy up to three acres at the
airport, also will cater to domesticated animals, including cats,
dogs and horses.
   Harry Tennison, president of Fort Worth-based Game Conservation
International, which is importing the rhinos for zoos in Dallas,
Fort Worth, San Diego and Milwaukee, said the Animal-Port is needed.
   ``It will be a great aid to our zoological people all over this
part of the world,'' he said.

<HEAD>Celebrities Turn Out To Raise Money To Protect `Jane Roe'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hollywood celebrities and local politicians
pledged thousands of dollars to provide protection for Norma
McCorvey, ``Jane Roe'' in the landmark Roe vs. Wade abortion case.
   Proceeds from the $100-a-plate Sunday brunch will pay for an
armed guard and temporary housing for McCorvey, whose home in
Dallas was the target of shotgun blasts this month in an attack she
blames on abortion foes.
   Among the 150 supporters attending the fund-raiser were
actresses Michele Lee, Barbara Bain, Valerie Harper, and Tina
Louise and actor-director Leonard Nimoy.
   ``I'm just overwhelmed by all this,'' said McCorvey.
   McCorvey also will be on hand Wednesday when the U.S. Supreme
Court hears arguments in a Missouri abortion case whose outcome
could reverse or weaken the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing
abortion.
   McCorvey said she has been harassed in recent weeks. Vandals
have thrown eggs at her home and strewn baby clothes on the front
yard.
   The most serious attack came April 4. As McCorvey slept, three
shotgun blasts shattered a window and damaged her car shortly
before she was to appear at a pro-choice march in Washington. She
has been in hiding since.
   ``I was frightened, of course,'' she said. ``Then I got very
mad.''

   Fur is expected to fly this week in the year's
first budget vote on the floor of Congress, despite the bipartisan
amity that so far has marked lawmakers' deficit-reduction efforts.
   The House is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a measure providing
$4.7 billion in new spending this year for veterans assistance,
anti-drug initiatives, education loans and other programs.
   The legislation has run into opposition from members of both
parties who say it would add to an already embarrassing fiscal 1989
deficit of $163 billion, and would trample spending limits that
former President Reagan and congressional leaders forged in a
budget summit pact two years ago.
   ``I hope I don't have to engage in immolation on the floor of
the House, but this is the last line in the sand,'' said Rep. Bill
Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget
Committee. ``This would be a stunning indictment of Congress for
being willing to go back on its word.''
   It is common this late in the fiscal year _ which ends Sept. 30
_ for Congress to provide money for unforseen needs.
   But with President Bush and lawmakers having recently shaken
hands on a deficit-cutting pact for 1990 that has been criticized
by some as phony and inadequate, many members of Congress are
sensitive about adding even more to this year's shortfall. They
also don't want to rupture relations with the administration, which
has threatened a veto of the measure because of its cost.
   ``This is a crucial vote for Congress, as to whether it will
stand by the spending limits of the 1987 budget summit and whether
it will stand by the agreement just arrived at,'' said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Frenzel and Panetta, who hope to trim the size of the bill, will
also be busy next week on fiscal 1990 matters. The House Budget
Committee plans to complete its work on a $1.2 trillion budget
which the two lawmakers hope will incorporate $28 billion in
savings hammered out in a month of negotiations with White House
officials.
   Since the budget agreement set broad spending levels for
domestic, defense and international affairs programs, the committee
must still divide spending within the domestic category. The
lawmakers must decide how to distribute $181.3 billion among
education, child care, space, science, housing and other
priorities, each of which has passionate proponents in Congress.
   Even then, congressional leaders may have to fend off
legislators who wish to alter the budget agreement by either
redistributing spending or seeking extra savings.
   ``There is a gnawing feeling among some members that this budget
agreement doesn't do that much,'' complained Rep. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., a member of the budget panel.
   The Senate Budget Committee voted 16-7 last Wednesday for a
$1.16 trillion version of the plan. House and Senate budget writers
say they want to settle their differences and complete work on the
spending plan by May 15, so they can plunge into subsequent bills
permitting the government to spend and raise money.
   With Bush insistently against large tax increases and Democrats
opposed to domestic cuts, congressional leaders believe the budget
plan will ultimately be approved.
   ``I don't see how anybody can come up with a real alternative
that has a chance,'' says Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking
Republican on the budget committee.
   In other congressional action, the House may vote Thursday on
whether to impeach U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon of
Mississippi. Nixon is hoping to return to the bench after serving a
five-year term for a perjury conviction. The House Judiciary
Committee is expected to vote Tuesday to send the matter to the
House floor.
   A major preoccupation in the House is the continuing ethics case
against Speaker Jim Wright. The Texas Democrat could appear before
the panel as early as this week.
   Wright was formally charged last week with 69 instances of House
rules violations, including charges that he accepted $145,000 in
``gifts'' from a business partner who had a direct interest in
legislation and that he evaded limits on outside income through
bulk sales of a book he wrote.
   Ethics committee members were scheduled to travel to Texas early
in the week to interview businessmen involved in an oil deal which
yielded large profits for Wright last year. That deal is the
subject of continuing investigation by the committee.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Help Needed To Enhance Capitol's Frayed Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's a new effort on Capitol Hill to polish
the tarnished image of Congress.
   No, the organizers, who include some of the weightiest movers
and shakers of the Senate and House, are not worried about scandals
or opinion polls or the accusations plaguing House Speaker Jim
Wright.
   Rather, they are concerned about the actual fabric of the place.
   To be precise, they worry about the preservation of the marble
and sandstone and bronze of which the Capitol building is composed,
the art work which adorns it, and the history the Capitol has
sheltered since Congress moved to Washington 189 years ago.
   They are aware also that in an era of shrinking budgets and
tight money, Congress is increasingly reluctant to appropriate
taxpayers' dollars for feathering the nest in which it does
business.
   So a group of congressional leaders sat down over coffee last
week and, with portraits of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams looking
over their shoulders, announced the imminent launching of the U.S.
Capitol Preservation Fund.
   The multiple purpose:
   _To persuade private citizens and corporations to do for the
Capitol what such contributors have already done for the White
House, for the historic Americana collection at the State
Department and for the newly refurbished Blair House, the
president's guest house.
   _To provide a way for the House and Senate to accept gifts of
fine art and historic items related to the history of Congress.
   _To use the money raised to undertake major restoration projects.
   In the first such effort, the deteriorating 19-foot bronze
statue of Freedom will be removed from its commanding perch on top
of the Capitol dome _ probably by helicopter _ and be brought to
earth for a major facelift costing at least $300,000.
   It will be the first time the statue has been moved since Dec.
2, 1863, when the last of its five separate parts was lifted to the
top of the dome by a steam hoist and hammered and bolted into place.
   Also on the drawing board is the installation on the Capitol's
East Plaza of two 30-foot Carrara marble fountains which were
crafted 19 years ago for Lady Bird Johnson's beautification
campaign but placed in storage when the money ran out.
   The installation of the fountains, and the paving of the plaza
with ornamental stone blocks planned for later, will banish the
cars that have used the plaza as a parking lot since the beginning
of the automotive age.
   Capitol Architect George White says money also is needed for the
restoration of dozens of works of art inside the Capitol itself.
   The initial fundraising is being handled by New York corporate
executive Preston R. Tisch, the former postmaster general.
   He predicts $1.5 million will be raised at a June 20 gala
celebrating the bicentennial of Congress.
   Funds also will be received from a 50 percent share of the
profits from the sale of coins commemorating the 200-year history
of Congress to be minted by the Treasury in five-dollar, one-dollar
and half-dollar denominations.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the Senate's president pro tem and
most ardent student of its history, says the fund and the Capitol
Preservation Commission created to administer it will be
``Congress' bicentennial gift to the nation.''
   ``What better testimony to Congress' 200 years than to ensure a
means to provide for the continued restoration of our nation's
symbol of democracy?'' Byrd said.
   ``The Capitol is a unique, working museum. Fifteen million
visitors come here each year, making it one of the most frequented
public buildings in the world. Through these efforts we are
committed to ensuring the ongoing legacy of the Capitol for
generations to come.''

   Agonizing personal experience led Linda Noie to
her fervent anti-abortion stance. Ten years ago, she had an
abortion _ but still carried a fetus to term and gave birth. She
shared her private anguish over that failed abortion with The
Associated Press, in a story that is one in a series examining the
emotional question of abortion rights as the U.S. Supreme Court
prepares to hear arguments this week.

   Two months after her abortion, Linda Noie
feared a cancerous tumor was growing inside her. But the rhythmic
buh-bump of a fetal heartbeat heard through a stethoscope confirmed
she was still pregnant.
   ``My tumor had a heartbeat, two beautiful arms and two beautiful
legs,'' Ms. Noie said.
   The episode in 1979 transformed Ms. Noie into a zealous
pro-lifer. Now the state director of Women Exploited By Abortion,
she lives next door to the clinic where she had the five-minute
surgery and pickets there at least twice a week.
   Her son, Joshua, now 9 years old, joins her at marches, rallies
and speeches. He wears a T-shirt saying: ``I Survived the Abortion
Holocaust.''
   ``If that baby could make it through that terrible experience,
that baby was mine, no matter what,'' Ms. Noie, 44, said. ``Nobody
was going to talk me into killing this baby. I thought I committed
murder one time. I wasn't going to do it again.
   ``There is a reason Joshua survived. I think God wanted to start
his army in the spiritual battle against abortion. He wanted
somebody to be on the front lines. Here we are, out on the
battlefront.''
   Nationally, the bitter abortion fight is approaching a turning
point.
   The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments April 26 on a
Missouri case that could narrow or overturn a 1973 ruling that
established a woman's right to abortion.
   When defenders of a woman's right to choose a safe, legal
abortion have marched on Washington, D.C., most recently April 9,
some have carried coat hangers as brutal reminders of back-alley
butchery done before 1973.
   Those opposed to abortion like Ms. Noie counter with pictures of
fetuses being cut up or sucked out of the womb. She has yelled at
patients and jumped in front of cars bringing pregnant women to the
Fox Valley Reproductive Health Care Center, where she had her
unsuccessful abortion.
   Her mailbox is painted crimson and adorned with red ribbon to
symbolize babies' blood.
   ``I don't want anyone else to get hurt like I was,'' Ms. Noie
said. ``I made a bad mistake. It eats away at me every day. I want
to be there for somebody else. I don't want them to look out and
not have anybody, like I did.
   ``Abortion doesn't just mean being unpregnant. It's legalized
murder. Babies are being killed,'' she said. ``You just can't put
it in a closet. That door doesn't quite shut tight. It's going to
creep out some day.''
   Ms. Noie says she's on a crusade to help women who feel guilt or
suffer psychological scars after their abortions. Dr. Vincent Rue,
a psychotherapist and former teacher at UCLA, called this condition
post-abortion syndrome and said it can include ``suppressed
hostility, unresolved mourning for the loss of the fetal child and
a re-experiencing of the abortion.''
   The way Ms. Noie sees it, the clinic either botched the abortion
or aborted a twin fetus.
   Maggi Case, director and owner of the clinic, declined to
comment on Ms. Noie's case because she is ``not at liberty to
discuss a patient's medical records.''
   Ms. Noie cried several times as she recounted her achingly
private pain in a recent interview. Her gaze frequently drifted out
the dining room window to a child's swing set and sandbox in the
backyard.
   In 1979, she was recently divorced after 15 years of marriage
and had two children aged 16 and 10. A waitress, she became
pregnant to a restaurant customer who befriended her.
   Afraid, confused and burdened with a pregnancy her boyfriend
didn't want, she scheduled an abortion at the clinic for Jan. 12.
   The day of the surgery, she wrote one word in her calendar
diary: ``slaughterhouse.'' After a five-hour wait in the crowded
clinic, she spent five minutes on the operating table. Her
boyfriend paid in cash.
   ``I was mixed up. I was wishing somebody would break in and take
me out of there. I wanted it stopped,'' Ms. Noie said. ``The pain
was awful. It seemed very, very wrong.
   ``I killed a baby. I felt so dirty and crummy. It was like part
of me was gone,'' she said. ``I couldn't look at myself in the
mirror. I was ready to commit suicide, not because I wanted to die,
but because I hated myself so badly for what I had done.''
   That night, she and her boyfriend ended their relationship.
   Ms. Noie returned a month later for a checkup, complaining about
being dizzy and weak at work. She was told the abortion had
``removed particles of conception'' but her hormones hadn't
readjusted.
   On March 29, she came back again and was referred to a second
doctor. When he checked her for a suspected tumor, she was given a
stethoscope and was asked, ``Do you want to hear your baby's
heartbeat?''
   Ms. Noie says her son has hearing lapses, memory loss and other
health effects that she attributes to the abortion.
   She returned to the clinic about a year after Joshua was born.
Dressed in black, she circled the stone and frame building,
touching it while Joshua played with driveway pebbles.
   ``I wanted to make sure it couldn't hurt me anymore,'' she said.
   A chain-link fence erected by the clinic marks the property line.
   ``I had nightmares when I first moved in,'' Ms. Noie said. ``I
dreamed of little babies with charred arms and legs crawling out of
the barrels in back where they burn their medical waste.
   ``Joshua likes the house, but he tells people he lives next to
the place where they kill babies,'' she said. ``Once when he was 3
years old, he woke up screaming at night and said, `Mommy, why did
you do it? Didn't you want me?'''

<TEXT>
   A vast arctic bay dubbed the ``golden
triangle'' for its unparalleled treasure of fish and wildlife may
be spared oil exploration because of the catastrophic effects
nearby of the nation's worst oil spill.
   Three Alaska governors and the stubborn fishermen of Bristol Bay
have appealed to three presidents to ban oil and gas drilling in
the bay, the richest red salmon grounds in the world.
   For 10 years the powerful of Washington brushed aside the pleas
of complainers living far, far away. Last year, nine oil companies
paid $95.4 million to the federal government to search for oil and
gas in Bristol Bay.
   This year, everything's different. Now the 4,500 people of
Bristol Bay, a 44,000-square-mile marine paradise even richer than
devastated Prince William Sound, are pleading their case again,
hoping that the wreck of the tanker Exxon Valdez will prompt
President Bush to hand back the money.
   With millions of fish threatened, thousands of birds dying, and
hundreds of sea otters dead in Prince William Sound, the despairing
fishermen of western Alaska suddenly have environmental clout and
renewed attention to their cause.
   ``I hate to say it, but without a doubt the spill may help us
save Bristol Bay,'' said Sue Flensburg, executive director of the
Bristol Bay Coastal Resource Service Area.
   Until the huge tanker split open last month, the faint, outraged
voices in Bristol Bay, 450 miles southwest of Prince William Sound,
on the very edge of the continent, were literally crying in the
wilderness.
   Oil-company assurances of environmental integrity and safety had
consistently won out.
   ``They always dangled their success in front of us,'' said
Deborah Tennyson, executive director of the Bristol Bay Native
Association.
   ``The oil companies and the feds said, `You're psychotic, you're
paranoid, we've shipped millions of gallons of oil out of Valdez,
we've got caribou grazing under the pipeline, little chicks are
being born at Prudhoe Bay, and the whales come back year after year
to Prince William Sound.'
   ``Well, a massive oil spill is like nuclear war,'' said Mrs.
Tennyson, who fishes along with her whole family during salmon
season.
   ``If it happens once it would be so horrible that saying,
`Sorry, we'll never do it again,' doesn't mean a damned thing. If
something like this happened in Bristol Bay it would be a cultural,
economic, and social holocaust.''
   Bristol Bay supports the world's largest red salmon fishery and
the largest herring fishery in U.S. waters, as well as a majority
of the world's northern fur seal population, the Pacific gray whale
population, and millions of seabirds, geese and ducks.
   To most Alaskans, the arguments for Bristol Bay boil down to
pure economics. A barrel of oil is worth about $20; most of the
year, a nine-pound Bristol Bay red salmon retails in Anchorage for
$74.25. Salmon is more plentiful than oil here, they say, and it is
a resource that renews itself.
   Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper claims Bristol Bay's wholesale fishery
value exceeds $1 billion and employs 10,000 people in a good year.
   ``It's always been obvious to us that our annual, renewable
resources far outweigh any potential oil and gas gains,'' said Ms.
Flensburg. ``Once oil is gone, it's gone forever, but our fish come
back every year. Why can't the federal government understand that?''
   The oil companies have pressed ahead with Bristol Bay plans
despite surveys that show limited oil deposits at best, and a
warning from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service dating back to 1978
that no adequate safeguards could protect Bristol Bay because of
strong tidal currents, severe winds, earthquakes, and heavy ice.
   Ten patches in the Bering, Chukch, and Beaufort seas totaling
480 million acres of ocean bottom have been identified by
geologists as potential Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas fields.
   The Interior Department pegs Bristol Bay's hydrocarbon potential
in the Bering Sea among the lowest in that OCS area, with perhaps
as little as 2 percent of the nation's undiscovered offshore
resources.
   Experts estimate the area contains anywhere between 63 million
and 615 million barrels of oil. By contrast, the Prudhoe Bay fields
which feed the trans-Alaska pipeline are estimated at 10 billion
barrels.
   At the most, Bristol Bay could amount to only about a month's
worth of oil consumption for the nation.
   Alaska officials, acutely aware that oil royalties now account
for more than 80 percent of the state's revenue, long ago learned
to coexist with the multinational energy companies and federal
regulators.
   Although state coffers don't gain a cent from drilling outside
Alaska's three-mile limit, former Governors Jay Hammond and Bill
Sheffield, as well as Cowper, all supported OCS leasing _ except in
Bristol Bay.
   But Alaska's decade-old effort to exclude Bristol Bay from OCS
sales was stymied by the reluctance of its own congressional
delegation to fight exploration, and the adamant refusal of
Presidents Carter and Reagan to exclude the bay from Interior
Department leasing.
   With nearly unanimous support from environmentalists and
fishermen, Alaska turned to the courts for help.
   ``This region is commonly referred to as the `golden
triangle,''' wrote Lance Trasky of the Alaska Department of Fish
and Game, during the lengthy litigation. ``These fish and wildlife
resources have great social and economic value ... to the world.''
   Last October, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
rejected the state's appeal. Immediately thereafter, bids were
opened and 23 tracts were leased by nine oil companies at an
average price of $783.87 an acre.
   Shell Western E&amp;P and Chevron USA, the two big winners,
announced plans to begin surveying as early as this summer, with
drilling to follow as soon as permits were obtained.
   In a last-ditch letter to Bush 24 days before the Prince William
Sound disaster, Cowper urged him to defer leasing long enough to
study environmental impacts of an oil spill in Bristol Bay.
   So far Cowper has had no reply from the White House.
   Alaska's Senate added its plea last week, unanimously passing a
resolution urging the federal government to hold up Bristol Bay
exploration.
   Hammond, the former governor and a Bristol Bay resident, agrees
that the politicians and oil companies have been listening to
Alaskans for years, but not hearing them.
   Like many, he feels the Prince William Sound disaster ``may be
the death knell to Bristol Bay leasing'' because of the nightmarish
potential if a spill happened here.
   But as a battle-scarred veteran of two decades of Alaskan
political infighting, the man who was governor throughout the
building of the trans-Alaska pipeline is also a realist.
   ``I am optimistic there's a substantially greater impediment to
Bristol Bay leasing today,'' said Hammond, ``but I am not
optimistic it will never be done. After all, this is Alaska.''
   Unhappily, Dillingham Mayor Joe McGill agreed.
   ``I liked living here so much better before electricity, taxes,
and lawyers,'' sighed McGill.
   ``When the oil companies are really ready to do it, they'll do
it. Hell, they're a lot bigger than a bunch of fishermen _ and
money in Alaska always talks.''

<TEXT>
   Today the small villages clinging to
the edge of the Bering Sea are springing to life with anticipation:
it's almost salmon season again, the high point of the year.
   Everything in Ekuk and Chignik, Aleknagik and Igiugig, and the
other 26 tiny settlements scattered around Bristol Bay takes on a
sense of urgency as Aleuts, Indians, Eskimos, and whites prepare
for the commercial fishing season.
   Mending nets, checking engines, painting hulls _ men, women, and
children whose entire annual income depends on their success on the
sea are now scrambling to be ready for that momentous day when the
salmon run.
   ``You forget everything else until after fishing season,'' said
Dillingham Mayor Joe McGill, a commercial fisherman in Bristol Bay
since 1947. ``That's all that matters. Dillingham goes from a
sleepy little town to a crazy metropolis.''
   The blazing summer Arctic sun now rises higher in the sky,
melting the bay's icepack and hundreds of inches of snow on boats
in the storage yard. This town of 1,570 becomes a hub for boat
repair, transportation, and speculation about the season ahead.
   Will it be a good one, like the last five, and yield enough to
make boat payments, cancel the winter's grub bill at the grocery
store, leave enough left over for a new refrigerator or even a trip
``outside'' to the lower 48 when the thermometer dips to 50-below
zero next January?
   The entire region, totaling 44,000 square miles, has a permanent
population of about 4,500.
   ``In the summer there's a big influx of people from `outside'
who come up just to fish and hope they make a killing in a month,''
said McGill. ``Forget flying out of here, this becomes the third
busiest airport in the state because of fishing _ fishermen coming
in, fish being flown out.''
   The year's cycle along Bristol Bay depends on the world's
richest red salmon run, which usually begins in mid-June and
continues at a fever pitch through mid-July before tapering off in
late summer.
   More than 3,500 fishing permits, involving about 10,000
fishermen, are issued by the state for Bristol Bay.
   Robert Heyano holds a permit, now worth more than $250,000. So
does his wife Marie, and his mother Rose, and two of his brothers.
His parents are the only year-round residents of Ekuk, 14 miles
south of Dillingham, where his father Peter is the cannery
caretaker. In the summer that tiny settlement swells to dozens who
camp out for three months' fishing.
   Heyano, like nearly everyone around Bristol Bay following the
Prince William Sound oil spill, is adamantly opposed to oil and gas
development in the precious fishing grounds.
   ``The whole rhythm of our lives is based on fishing and
subsistence hunting,'' said Heyano, 37. ``If you weren't able to do
that I don't see how anyone could continue to live in a village.
The meaning of life would be gone.''

   Soviets once danced in the streets to celebrate
their country's space successes, hailed by the party as proof of
the superiority of socialism.
   But with chronic shortages of everything from toothpaste to
housing, the cheers are now drowned out by calls to spend available
rubles on Earth.
   The Soviet space program has become the latest target of
criticism as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or openness, unleashes long-suppressed public
complaints.
   Untold billions of rubles were spent to put the first Sputnik
satellite in orbit 1957, to make Yuri Gagarin the first man in
space in 1961, and to achieve other space feats.
   On April 12, the anniversary of Gagarin's flight in Vostok-1, a
newspaper recalled how Soviets celebrated the news by singing and
dancing through the streets.
   But more than 31 years after Sputnik circled the globe, Soviet
space exploration has not realized the prediction of Russian rocket
pioneer Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who said harnessing the cosmos
would bring ``mountains of bread and enormous power'' to those who
mastered it.
   Soviets began soul-searching about space expenses after a series
of problems with their country's space program. The problems
coincided with official pressure to cut a $162 billion budget
deficit and growing impatience with shortages of food, consumer
goods and housing.
   In part for economy reasons, the Mir space lab will be without a
crew for three months starting Thursday when three cosmonauts
return to Earth.
   The debate on Soviet space spending is reminiscent of the
American public's questioning of the billions of dollars spent on
the Apollo project in the 1960s and 1970s to put men on the moon
while some Americans lived in poverty.
   Controversy over space spending spilled into the open early this
year in the campaign for a new parliament. Candidates, including
maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, received some popular support
when they suggested the space program be put on hold for a few
years.
   The Kremlin already has reduced outlays for another institution
once outside public criticism, the military. Last year, Soviet
leaders announced some defense plants will be converted to produce
consumer goods, food and building supplies to parry chronic
shortages.
   Adding fuel to the space-spending controversy were the November
launch of the $10 billion shuttle Buran; the loss in September and
March of two unmanned Mars probes, Phobos I and II, at a cost of a
half-billion dollars; and embarrasing delays caused by technical
problems and human error in the landings of the last two crews from
Mir last year.
   Opposition grew when space officials hungry for foreign currency
last month chose a Japanese _ and not a Soviet who could only pay
rubles _ for the first commercial trip to Mir. The price tag was
$11 million.
   The public has flooded the press with letters, and articles have
examined the costs and benefits of the space program.
   ``Isn't it too lavish to finance space? Perhaps it pays to stop
until we fill the holes (shortages),'' 10 readers suggested in a
joint letter to the Defense Ministry daily, Red Star.
   Defenders of space exploration emphasize the benefits of
technology and information transfers to the Earth-bound economy.
The Tass news agency recently reported that more than $2 billion
was spent on space research in the Soviet Union last year and that
economic benefits totaled $3.2 billion.
   Satellites have gathered weather information, extended
television and telephone service, aided navigation of ships and
located mineral and oil deposits, according to articles in
state-run media.
   But media reports have said industry is not adequately using the
information and technology, and they have criticized the
spendthrift attitude of government agencies involved in space.
   Pravda and other newspapers say public support has declined
because space officials tout successes and hide problems.
   ``Such propaganda not only did not inspire trust, but conversely
alienated people from this sphere and took away their feeling of
participation,'' wrote the space correspondent of the labor daily
Trud, Vitaly Golovachev.
   Space scientist Roald Sagdeyev said officials must work hard to
save the space program and also acknowledge failures.
   ``We have one very serious task: to restore the people's faith,
though glasnost, through truthful information that is honest to the
end,'' he told colleagues at a recent meeting about the Phobos
problems. ``We must show and prove to the people that without
space, mankind doesn't have a future.''
   Some Soviet officials admit they have made mistakes,
particularly in not doing more to put space research to practical
use. They envy the United States for sucesses in that area.
   ``Our space technology is one of the most advanced. Naturally if
we do it right like the Americans and convert it to other fields,
we can receive a big economic effect,'' said Viktor D. Blagov,
Mir's deputy flight director.
   Blagov, in a telephone interview, cited NASA figures that for
every dollar invested in the U.S. space program, $9 is returned in
technology benefits. According to the Tass figures, the Soviet
return is about 1.5 rubles for every ruble spent.
   In an attempt to make space research yield a better financial
return, NASA's Soviet counterpart, Glavkosmos, is hoping to sell
crystals grown in Mir's zero-gravity for use in electronics, as
well as medicines manufactured on the space station.
   The Soviets also are starting to charge foreign crews that want
to travel to Mir, at $10-12 million a shot.

   A U.S. trade association says worldwide growth
rates for computers and other information technology are likely to
fall between now and 1993.
   The Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association
says it expects that only telecommunications equipment will buck
the trend. Global revenues of the information technology industry
in 1988 totaled $604.7 billion, up 11.2 percent from the previous
year, the association says.
   The figure includes computers and other electronic data
processing equipment, $304 billion; office equipment, $62.1
billion; telecommunications equipment, $112.2 billion; as well as
software and services, $126.4 billion.
   In a global market analysis issued last week, CBEMA said
information industry revenues grew at an average annual rate of
10.8 percent over the period 1980-88. But that growth rate, it
said, is projected to decrease to 8.7 percent a year for the period
from 1988 through 1993.
   Looking ahead for the next four years, ``there is a slowdown in
all equipment markets except telecommunications,'' said Helga
Sayadian, director of industry marketing statistics for the
Washington-based association.
   Ms. Sayadian said this trend ``reflects economic conditions
worldwide and the slight recession that is forecast near the
beginning of next year.''
   For electronic data processing equipment, the worldwide annual
growth rate averaged 12.3 percent in 1980-88 and is projected to
drop to 8.9 percent in 1988-93.
   Average annual growth for office equipment was 9.3 percent in
1980-88 and is forecast to decline to 7.7 percent in 1988-93, while
yearly growth of software and services averaged 19 percent in
1980-88 and is projected to drop to 11.9 percent in 1988-93.
   By contrast, CBEMA said, annual growth for telecommunications
equipment is forecast to increase slightly from 4.5 percent in
1980-88 to 5.3 percent in 1988-93.
   For 1988, consumption of information technology in North America
totaled $299.4 billion; Europe, $212.4 billion; Asia, $76.7
billion; South America, $8.8 billion, and the rest of the world,
$7.4 billion.
   Projections for 1993 are North America, $448.6 billion; Europe,
$303.3 billion; Asia, $141.1 billion; South America, $16.2 billion,
and the rest of the world, $12.1 billion, for a global total of
$921.1 billion.
   In terms of market share, the share of worldwide information
technology accounted for by electronic data processing equipment
was 50.3 percent in 1988 and is forecast to edge up slightly to
50.5 percent by 1993. Software and services are projected to rise
from 20.8 percent in 1988 to 24.1 percent in 1993.
   However, the global market share for telecommunications
equipment is expected to drop from 18.6 percent in 1988 to 15.7
percent in 1993, while office equipment is projected to decline
from 10.3 percent in 1988 to 9.7 percent in 1993.
   The CBEMA study was prepared by the Center for Economic Analysis
Inc., a consulting firm based in Stamford, Conn., in cooperation
with the association's Industry Marketing Statistics Committee.

   The abrupt decision of Tamil rebels to
come to the negotiating table after six years of waging jungle
warfare and massacring civilians could herald a breakthrough for
Sri Lanka's new president.
   However, it might also be a shrewd, pragmatic maneuver by the
Tamil Tigers to consign rival Tamil groups to the political
wilderness and then pick up the fight for a separate homeland, some
analysts say.
   Preparations for peace talks between the rebels and the
government are likely to start in earnest this week with the
arrival of the leader of the rebel delegation, Anton Balasingham.
He is a Sri Lankan native who holds British citizenship and lives
in London.
   The government has blamed the Tigers for the deaths of about
9,000 people, mostly Sinhalese civilians. However, no major attacks
have been reported since April 15, when the Tigers sent President
Ranasinghe Premadasa a letter saying they would accept his offer
for peace talks.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratna, who also serves as deputy
defense minister, said the Tigers' sudden change of heart may have
surprised the world, but not Sri Lanka.
   ``After what we have been through, nothing surprises us
anymore,'' he said.
   Premadasa took office in January, replacing Junius R.
Jayewardene, who had governed since 1977.
   Early this month, Premadasa declared he was ready to go anywhere
in the country to meet the Tigers. He also offered them amnesty,
jobs, measures to ensure better treatment of their ethnic minority,
and seats in Parliament if they gave up their insurrection.
   Premadasa belongs to the Sinhalese majority, which has dominated
Sri Lanka since independence from Britain in 1949. Sinhalese, who
are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of the 16 million people
on this island off India's southern coast.
   The Tamils, who account for 18 percent, are mostly Hindus and
say they suffer discrimination under the Sinhalese.
   Tamil sources say the Tigers will ask Premadasa to dissolve a
newly created joint administrative council for Northern and Eastern
provinces and order new elections with Tiger participation.
   The government put in motion a plan for greater Tamil autonomy
after an accord with India in 1987. India, which has millions of
its own Tamils, sent in peacekeeping troops under the pact.
   When the Tigers refused to participate in the provincial
elections, rival Tamil groups that once fought beside the Tigers
swept the balloting. The Tigers began to attack troops from India,
once viewed as their protector.
   The autonomy plan also generated a backlash by militant
Sinhalese, who mounted attacks in an effort to force the government
into tougher treatment of the Tamils.
   An independent Tamil and veteran of the political scene
suggested the Tigers' sudden willingness to talk peace may stem
from a desire to dislodge their former allies from the political
front. Afterward, the Tigers might resume their fight for a
separate homeland in the northeast, he said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   The Tigers are also expected to demand withdrawal of the Indian
forces. The president has also called for a pullout.
   The Tamil source, however, questioned whether India would give
Premadasa a free hand to negotiate with the rebels.
   An Indian government spokeswoman said her government would
welcome such talks.
   ``India's whole purpose of signing the (1987) accord was to
bring peace to this country,'' said the spokeswoman for the Indian
Embassy who commented on condition of anonymity.
   Many of the guerrillas are teen-agers who have known no work but
war and killing, and some analysts wonder if such fighters will
accept a political solution.
   One Tamil soldier, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
was certain ``the boys in the jungle'' would lay down their weapons
if commanders told them to do so.
   He said they wear lethal cyanide capsules around their necks and
sometimes bite them under orders to avoid capture.

<HEAD>Recession Fears Grow Despite Bush Assessment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More and more economists are expressing
pessimism about the chances of surviving another year without a
recession as fears over rising inflation and tight-credit policies
continue to mount.
   Some analysts are even raising the spectre of the old bugaboo of
the 1970s, stagflation, a period when growth slows and unemployment
climbs but inflation rises as well.
   For its part, the Bush administration is continuing to insist
that the economy is on track for a ``soft landing'' in which growth
slows enough to dampen inflationary pressures but not enough to
push the country into a recession.
   But private economists are not so sure. The latest survey of 50
top economists issued each month by Blue Chip Economic Indicators,
an investment newsletter, showed that more than half of the panel
now expect a recession to begin by late this year or early next
year.
   Even those analysts who are not predicting an outright
recession, defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth,
are looking for this year to be extremely sluggish.
   The government's first look at how the overall economy is
performing will be issued on Wednesday and, despite all the
pessimism, the number is expected to be very good, on paper at
least.
   Many forecasters believe the gross national product, the total
output of goods and services, expanded at an annual rate of 5
percent in the January-March quarter.
   That would represent the fastest rate of growth in more than a
year and would be double the 2.4 percent GNP rate turned in during
the final three months of 1988.
   The trouble is that all of the pickup in growth will result from
an artificial calculation needed to close out the books on last
summer's devastating drought.
   While the drought's primary impact on the economy occurred in
the second and third quarters last year, the Commerce Department
annualized its figures to show the lost farm output for the entire
year. Now with a new year, there will be an artificial bounceback
in the numbers.
   Discounting this factor, economic growth is expected to have
slowed dramatically in the first three months of this year to
around 2.5 percent, down a full percentage point from the 3.5
percent non-farm growth in the fourth quarter.
   Early statistics showing sluggish retail sales and plunging
housing construction in April have bolstered the belief that the
economy will slow even further in the current April-June quarter.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with Data Resources Inc. of
Lexington, Mass., said GNP growth would likely fall below 2 percent
in the current quarter and average a weak 1 percent rate in the
second half of the year.
   An economy growing at such sluggish rates would not be able to
generate enough new jobs to keep the unemployment rate from rising.
   Ms. Latta said DRI is forecasting that unemployment will climb
to 5.6 percent by the end of the year, up from the current 15-year
low of 5 percent.
   Ms. Latta said she is not forecasting a recession because she
believes the Federal Reserve will be successful in its year-long
effort to tighten credit enough to dampen demand but not enough to
push the country into a slump.
   ``We believe the odds still favor a soft landing. The slowdown
has been fairly broadly distributed and there is not a sign that
any one sector is going to collapse,'' she said.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
too believed the country would be able to escape without a
recession over the next year, as long as business profits do not
begin to suffer from escalating wage demands or rising costs for
raw materials.
   ``We don't really get recessions until businesses get nervous
and start cutting back,'' he said. ``I don't see signs that is
happening.''
   But Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., is
predicting a recession beginning early next year.
   ``I side with history,'' he said. ``The Fed is making a mighty
effort to engineer a soft landing for the economy, but in the past
they have failed more often they have succeeded.''
   Some analysts believe the Bush administration would be wise to
take a downturn now, as far away from the next presidential
election as possible, just as Ronald Reagan did in his first term,
when the country suffered through the 1981-82 recession.
   But administration officials, who are counting on robust
economic growth to meet the goal of lowering the federal budget
deficit below $100 billion next year, continue to insist that they
see no signs of a downturn.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said in recent congressional testimony that he remained
optimistic that the current economic expansion would be able to
continue for some time to come as long as policy makers avoid
mistakes, such as increasing taxes, to balance the budget.

   Another all-male bastion fell with the induction
of 30 women, including author Eudora Welty and actress Helen Hayes,
into the Players Club, founded 100 years ago by Edwin Booth, a
celebrated Shakespearean actor.
   The admission of women Sunday coincided with the club's
centennial and with Shakespeare's birthday. Women had long been
permitted into the club once a year on the anniversary of the
bard's birth.
   The 1,000-member club for actors, performers and writers also
chose Sunday to bestow upon Miss Hayes the first Edwin Booth Award
for her lifetime achievement in theater.
   Asked how women would affect the club's atmosphere, the
88-year-old actress said: ``Well, I don't think we'll be too
obnoxious.''
   The Players voted to admit women in September 1987 in
anticipation of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that upheld an
anti-discrimination law at clubs. The induction was delayed because
of renovations at the club's Greek-columned Gramercy Park townhouse.
   Also inducted were Lauren Bacall, Carol Burnett, Mary Tyler
Moore, Agnes De Mille, Colleen Dewhurst, Lillian Gish, Angela
Lansbury, Toni Morrison, Dina Merrill and Kitty Carlisle Hart.
   ``It's ruined. It's over,'' joked talk show host and club member
Dick Cavett. ``They'll be putting up pretty pink wallpaper. What
would Mark Twain say? He was one of the first members, and if his
billiard cue falls off the wall when the first woman plays, we'll
know.''

   The success of the country rock band
Alabama doesn't rely on awards but comes from performing music the
group enjoys, says band member Randy Owen.
   ``I think when we first started we were graded on the fact that
we were different and we were given credit for a certain different
sound,'' Owen said in an interview published Sunday in The
Tennessean.
   ``Now, hopefully people are going to understand that our success
has a great deal to do with our fans and with ... doing what we
really enjoy,'' Owen said.
   Owen and fellow band members Teddy Gentry, Jeff Cook and Merk
Herndon recently were named Artist of the Decade by the Country
Music Association and three times have taken Entertainer of the
Year honors.
   The group's new album, ``Southern Star,'' has sold half a
million copies since January. The band's other hits include
``Dixieland Delight'' and ``Roll On.''

   Tom Hayden says his separation from
Oscar-winning actress Jane Fonda won't curb his activism or hurt
his fund-raising among celebrities for his re-election campaign.
   ``I don't think my affinity with liberals in the entertainment
industry is fundamentally affected by what happens to Jane Fonda or
myself. I like to believe that they're interested in issues, and I
think they are,'' he said on Sunday's KNBC-TV show ``News
Conference.''
   Hayden said he was certain he will be able to raise money for
his planned re-election campaign for state assemblyman or if he
decides to run for state insurance commissioner.
   The trial separation, announced in February, also won't affect
the core of younger celebrities inspired by their activism, Hayden
said.
   ``I may not be as much a part of the Hollywood left as I have
been in the past, but that's all right. They're solid, mature
people whose appetite for politics and for change has been whetted
and definitely they don't need gurus or senior advisers,'' he said.
   The Hayden-Fonda marriage in January 1973 grew out of their
anti-Vietnam War politics. They have two children.

   Comedian Lucille Ball is in good spirits and
everyone is optimistic she'll make a full recovery from a heart
attack and emergency surgery, a hospital spokesman said.
   The 77-year-old entertainer, who remained in serious condition,
has gotten out of her bed and into a chair a few times under doctor
supervision, said Ron Wise, spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center.
   ``Everyone is very optimistic that she is on the road to
complete recovery,'' Wise said Sunday. ``She's awake. She's alert.
She's talking to her husband, to her daughter, to her doctors, to
her nurses.''
   Miss Ball underwent surgery last Tuesday to repair part of a
major heart artery and a heart valve with donor tissue.

   Basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
played in the final regular-season game of his 20-year professional
career, and walked away with a Rolls-Royce from his Los Angeles
Lakers teammates.
   The Lakers' owner is also having a tennis court built on
Abdul-Jabbar's estate in Hawaii and a street near the Forum has
been named after him.
   Abdul-Jabbar, who turned 42 on April 16, was honored in a
45-minute retirement ceremony before Sunday's game with the Seattle
SuperSonics. The Lakers open their bid for a third straight
National Basketball Association title Thursday night.
   When presenting Abdul-Jabbar with the Rolls-Royce, teammate
Magic Johnson said, ``Since you've been carrying us on your back
all these years, we decided to get you something to carry you
around town. We hope that you enjoy it. All we want is a ride.''
   Abdul-Jabbar played his first six professional seasons with the
Milwaukee Bucks before being traded to the Lakers after the 1974-75
season. He is the NBA's all-time leading scorer and has played more
games, minutes and seasons than anyone in league history.
   An obviously moved Abdul-Jabbar said at the end of the ceremony,
``I've run out of words, I'm losing my voice. I just want to say, I
love you all.''

<HEAD>Mountain Kingdom Suffers For Standing Up To Its Neighbor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BINAYA GURUACHARYA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When tiny Nepal stood up to its giant
neighbor India in a treaty dispute, India imposed a trade blockade
that has caused shortages of fuel, salt, medicines and other
essentials in the mountain kingdom.
   The trouble started last month when Nepal rebuffed India by
refusing to accept a treaty encompassing both trade and transit
rights.
   Nepal wanted to renew two separate treaties _ one for trade and
the other for transit, or passage through the country _ that
expired March 23.
   Being a landlocked nation, Nepal insists that transit is a
constant necessity and wants it treated separately on a long-term
basis rather than linked in a trade pact with changing conditions.
   India's halt on trade with its Himalayan neighbor has created
hardships for many of Nepal's 17 million people.
   Dipak Silwal, a schoolteacher, called India's move ``the
unfriendly act of a friendly country.''
   ``They have stopped export of even salt. India wanted to deprive
Nepalese of even that pinch of salt essential for human
consumption,'' he said.
   Kamal Tuladhar, the owner of a pharmacy, said, ``We are unable
to meet the demands of people who need regular medicines to treat
diabetes, heart diseases or blood pressure.''
   Before the blockade Nepal imported more than $150,000 worth of
medicines from India each month.
   Nepal is bordered on three sides by India and shares its
northern frontier with China's Tibet region. That geography has led
Nepal to conduct most of its business with India and handle
virtually all other foreign trade through the Indian port of
Calcutta.
   When the treaties lapsed, India closed 13 of the 15 crossing
points along the border with Nepal and stopped exports.
   If India wins the argument and Nepal agrees on one treaty
covering both trade and transit that would give give India a
stronger bargaining position in any future disputes.
   Both India and Nepal are predominantly Hindu and have had a
special relationship for decades. But China has been wooing Nepal
and India has watched with concern China's growing influence on the
buffer state.
   Indian-Nepalese relations were hurt earlier this year when Nepal
bought artillery from China. Nepal also offered China and other
nations trade terms that India considered better than the offers it
had received.
   Silwal expressed confidence the Nepalese could cope with the
situation while the stalemate continues: ``We can survive with them
(the Indian goods) or without them and most things, though
rationed, are available in the markets.'' People in Katmandu now
use kerosene to cook because gas, imported from India, is not
available. But some people say the weekly ration of about three
quarts of kerosene per family is insufficient.
   Truckloads of logs for fuel are being hauled into the capital
from the southern plains and that is causing a problem.
   The sharp rise in logging and ``thoughtless destruction of
forest will adversely effect the environment,'' said K.P. Sigdel,
the head of Nepal's Forum of Environment Communicators.
   Nepal has bought petroleum products from Singapore, Saudi Arabia
and other countries but shipments are held up at the Indian border
and the government rationed gasoline.
   ``I get 15 liters (about 4 gallons) of gasoline per week, but
this is hardly enough for a day,'' said taxi driver Laxmi
Manandhar. ``I have to garage my car most of the time.''
   An Indian news agency reported that smugglers who once supplied
luxury goods to the Nepalese ``are now doing a booming business in
items like salt, kerosene, gasoline and diesel fuel.''
   ``About 500 couriers are operating along the border and
delivering their wares to remote areas,'' said United News of India.

<HEAD>Prenatal Testing Used By Some To Select Gender Of Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The gender of a family's children once was
determined by nature alone, but modern prenatal testing techniques
now enable expectant parents to make calculated decisions about
having sons or daughters.
   The tests, in effect, give parents an option, although one that
is rarely exercised. Pregnant with a girl but want a boy? Get an
abortion and try again. Eventually, you should get the gender of
your choice.
   Many people consider this practice repugnant and perhaps a first
step toward eugenics. It is almost universally condemned by
geneticists who conduct the prenatal tests. Those in favor of a
woman's right to abortion usually are opposed to gender choice. And
surveys show that only a very, very few pregnant women will
actually abort for sex selection.
   But the fact that this type of family planning is possible, and
available, is one of the dark undercurrents that continues to haunt
the increasingly sophisticated world of modern human reproduction.
And it is an element cited by groups who oppose abortions made
legal by the Roe vs. Wade decision of the Supreme Court.
   The court, in a case from Missouri, is being asked to overturn
or substantially limit that landmark 1973 decision. Arguments are
scheduled Wednesday in that case, which does not specifically
involve the gender-selection issue.
   The two types of prenatal testing, chorion villus sampling and
amniocentesis, are used most frequently to determine if the fetus
has some sort of genetic abnormality. Women who take these tests do
so in anticipation of having an abortion if the fetus is shown to
have a severe birth defect.
   Except for some rare genetic defects, determining the gender is
just an incidental part of the prenatal test findings. But for some
American couples _ apparently a rare few _ it is the whole point of
the tests.
   Dr. Mark I. Evans, a Detroit doctor who is on the ethics
committee of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology,
said the number of American women who use prenatal testing to
control the gender of their children is ``incredibly minuscule.''
   ``In five years, I've only been aware of two cases,'' said
Evans, who has a large practice specializing in prenatal testing.
``That's two cases out of about 10,000. It's an incredibly
minuscule problem and everybody is making a mountain out of a
molehill.''
   Evans, however, was concerned enough about the issue to take a
survey of colleagues. He found that 20 percent of the 212 doctors
surveyed around the country believe gender selection is morally
acceptable. But, nonetheless, very few will actually participate in
the practice. And most said they very rarely are presented with the
dilemma.
   ``Having talked to colleagues around the country, I've found
that everybody's experience is roughly the same,'' said Evans.
   Doctors who perform prenatal testing in Philadelphia,
Washington, Houston, San Francisco and other major centers all
reported that they get so few requests for gender selection testing
that it is not considered a problem of significance.
   ``We've done 25,000 prenatal diagnosis and it has happened to us
only a few times,'' said Dr. Mitchell S. Goldbus of the University
of California Medical Center in San Francisco. ``We run into it
about one per thousand.''
   The policy at most centers is to specifically reject patients
who ask for prenatal testing to determine gender alone. But doctors
admit they don't always know. Patients sometimes will request the
testing for a genetic reason but actually are seeking the gender.
   ``It's possible to be fooled occasionally, but I really think
that on a percentage basis it is a very low number,'' said Evans.
   One doctor who will perform prenatal testing for gender
selection is Dr. Gabriel Khodr of San Antonio and he reacts to
criticism from other doctors in no uncertain terms.
   ``Who are they to impose their morality to others?'' Khodr asked
in a telephone interview.
   He said doctors will perform abortions for economic reasons, for
reasons of birth control, or because the pregnancy is
``inconvenient'' for the mother, but then balk at abortions for
gender selection.
   ``If they don't do abortions at all, then I accept their
point,'' said Khodr. ``But if they do abortions, then they don't
have right to say `I do abortions for any reason but sex
selection.' Why is it worse to want an abortion for family planning
when you've got three girls and don't want another?''
   He adds: ``I don't like abortions and I don't do abortions. But
who am I to force my morality on others?''
   Khodr said that even though it is known that he will do prenatal
testing for gender selection, he still sees such patients only
rarely.
   He said last year he had two pregnant patients who requested the
service for the same reason _ they both had three sons and were
determined to have a daughter. Khodr said that by coincidence, both
women got their wish. They gave birth to daughters.
   Evans and others, however, believe that prenatal testing should
be used only to detect a possible disease or genetic defect.
Permitting parents to select the gender of their offspring could
eventually lead to a distortion of the natural balance of the
sexes, they feel, since most parents asking for the service are
usually seeking sons.
   ``I am perfectly comfortable with (pregnancy) termination for
genetic abnormalities, but being female is not an abnormality,''
said Evans. ``I am in favor of genetic testing. I am not in favor
of eugenics.''
   Most of the genetic testing centers said requests for gender
selection usually come from couples who are Indian, Chinese, or
Arab.
   ``Most of the family that use sex selection come from a culture
that considers a male in the family to be important for social and
economic stability,'' said Karen Copeland, a counselor at the
Baylor College of Medicine genetics center in Houston. ``Those are
primarily Chinese, east Indian and some of the Middle Eastern
countries. Those are the ones who if they have several females will
consider ending the pregnancy if it's another girl.''
   Ms. Copeland said she will turn such patients away from Baylor,
but, if asked, will refer them to Dr. Khodr.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is showing little inclination
to delegate a lot of authority to subordinates, even though he
surrounded himself with strong personalities in the Cabinet and in
his inner circle of top-level White House advisers.
   Bush has said he wants his Cabinet members to speak out, to say
what they think. So he did not directly second-guess Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh when asked last week what he thought about
Thornburgh's idea to test public housing tenants for drug use.
   ``We've got a good Cabinet system, and I encourage people to
speak out,'' the president said. ``But the decisions on something
of that nature will be made right here ... and they're not going to
be made until I have all the facts.''
   How Bush goes about the job of fact-finding as he nears
decisions on key issues says much about the style of his presidency
_ and the relative strength of his staff.
   Despite the presence of some key presidential advisers from past
administrations, such as national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
and budget director Richard Darman, Bush's staff, in relative
terms, is less influential than many of its predecessors.
   Administration sources and Republican Party officials privy to
how things work in the White House inner sanctum said in interviews
that Bush is a much more activist, hands-on type of president. He
gets immersed in the kind of internal policy debates that his
predecessor, Ronald Reagan, sought to avoid, these observers said.
   Reagan's aides frequently depicted him as a passive player in
the Cabinet, sub-Cabinet and staff-level discussions of policy
options, saying he chose to stay away from the arguments and await
the recommendations of his aides.
   Typifying the contrasting Bush style was a call that one
presidential adviser got at home on a Saturday night. Bush wanted
to find out what had been done about a matter they discussed
earlier in the week, and he didn't want to wait until Monday, said
the aide, who asked not to be identified.
   When the White House press corps was told at the last moment
recently that Bush had canceled a planned four-day weekend trip to
his seaside resort home in Kennebunkport, Maine, press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater explained that the president had decided he simply
didn't want to go there after all.
   Interviews with a host of knowledgeable Republicans inside and
outside the administration produced a consensus on the most
powerful of the Bush aides. Not surprisingly, Scowcroft, Darman and
chief of staff John Sununu topped the list. Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, predictably, continues to wield heavy influence.
   ``The proximity question has a lot to do with your influence,''
said Tom Korologos, a consultant who was close to the Reagan White
House and has ties to the new administration as well. ``A guy can
walk up to him in the hallway and say, `Hey, how do you feel about
this?''' he said. ``That might be considered bad government, but
that's the way it works.''
   An administration official, speaking anonymously, said that in
the Bush White House, compared to Reagan's, ``it's a much more
difficult role for the staff ... because they never know just where
they stand. They never have absolute authority to do something
because Bush interjects himself so much.''
   ``In the Reagan administration, you could feel pretty safe to
act, at least on what things to recommend, if you had a pretty good
line on the Reagan philosophy,'' he said. ``But with Bush, it (the
issue under debate) could turn around at any moment.''
   Gary Bauer, who was a domestic policy adviser to Reagan and who
now runs a private family research center, said that Reagan ``used
to like for us to thoroughly discuss and air these issues without
him. And if there was a consensus, bring it to him for sign-off. If
there wasn't, to go and debate it in front of him.''
   ``My sense is that President Bush wants to be involved as much
as he can in an issue and I think that just requires the staff to
operate differently,'' Bauer said, adding:
   ``When I was there, one sometimes got frustrated that you didn't
have more presidential involvement early on. But on the other hand,
it really gave you a chance to assert yourself and to influence
policy. ... Maybe they (the Bush staff) wish they had a little more
flexibility to act before the president gets into it.''
   Former White House political adviser Mitchell Daniels said that
while Bush has a strong first team of advisers like Sununu, Darman
and Scowcroft, he believes the lower-level aides perform
essentially as functionaries.
   The administration official said the staff is ``less powerful''
under Bush than under Reagan because Bush is ``more engaged and is
deciding more of the issues. Bush is less predictable than Reagan.
He's a sort of compromiser and do-what's-right kind of person.''
   Korologos said that while Reagan ran the White House like a
chairman of the board of a business, Bush operates much in the
fashion of a corporate chief executive officer.
   ``George Bush knows this government. He doesn't have to learn
the initials and the acronyms,'' Korologos said.

<HEAD>Some Analysts Question Watkins' Warnings on Oil Import Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is sounding a suddenly
louder alarm about the nation's growing dependence on foreign oil,
yet some private and government analysts say talk of an approaching
supply crisis may be exaggerated.
   ``Our vulnerability to oil supply disruptions is greater today
than it was at the time of the Arab oil embargo,'' Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins told a meeting of oil executives last week. ``Time
is running out,'' he said, for action to avert a crisis.
   Watkins has begun speaking out on the issue recently as he seeks
to galvanize public support for key Bush administration energy
goals: a revival of the commercial nuclear power industry, support
for domestic oil drilling, complete decontrol of natural gas prices
and faster development of new energy technologies.
   Although the country's reliance on imported oil has been growing
since 1985, the Energy Department under John Herrington boasted
even in the final months of the Reagan administration that U.S.
energy security had been strengthened.
   ``Our reliance on insecure sources of imported oil has been
sharply reduced,'' Herrington wrote in an October 1988 report,
adding that ``... the United States is better prepared than ever
before for an oil supply interruption.''
   The Commerce Department, in a report published two months ago,
said, ``Since 1979, U.S. energy security has been strengthened and
the United States is better prepared than before to deter as well
as respond to an energy supply emergency.''
   A similar conclusion was drawn by the General Accounting Office,
the investigative arm of Congress, in a broad assessment of oil
trends last August.
   ``The United States and other major oil-importing countries are
less vulnerable to an oil crisis today than they were a decade
ago,'' the GAO report said.
   Nearly all energy analysts, in and out of government, agree that
the United States is fast approaching the day when it gets more
than half its oil from abroad. Most say this carries increased
risk. But some dispute Watkins' assertion that the trend makes it
more likely the nation will face a supply crisis.
   ``It is just as meaningless to claim that we are moving
inevitably toward another oil supply crisis as it is to say it
can't happen again,'' John Lichtblau, executive director of the
Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, told a House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee last week.
   ``The mere fact that our imports are rising does not per se
increase the probability of another foreign supply disruption,'' he
said.
   In the first three months of this year, oil imports averaged 44
percent of total U.S. supplies. That is up from an average last
year of 37 percent and the recent low point of 27 percent in 1985,
before oil prices crashed, according to Energy Department figures.
   In 1973, the year key Arab producers embargoed oil shipments to
the United States to protest U.S. support for Israel, U.S. imports
were 35 percent of total supplies. In 1977, imports peaked at a
record 46.5 percent of supplies.
   And while the share of U.S. oil supplies originating in Arab
countries also has been rising _ reaching 10.6 percent last year,
according to the department _ it is less than the proportion
supplied by non-Arab producers. Non-Arab foreign oil accounted for
26.4 percent of U.S. supplies last year, up from 24.3 percent in
1985.
   Analysts expect the import trend to continue as production from
U.S. wells declines.
   Lichtblau said last month's massive Exxon oil spill in Alaska
showed there are risks to consider even in the domestic supply
system. A brief interruption of shipments from the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline System as a result of the spill helped trigger a temporary
but sharp jump in gasoline prices across the country.
   Watkins, in a view shared by the oil industry, says overcoming
environmental concerns about new oil development in Alaska is a
vital step toward reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and
lessening the risks of a supply crisis.
   He has struck a similar note in the department's battle to stop
New York Gov. Mario Cuomo from carrying out a plan to scrap the
Shoreham nuclear power plant on Long Island. Federal regulators
last Thursday approved a full-power license for the plant, but
Cuomo and the plant's owner have struck a deal under which it would
be dismantled before ever producing a single kilowatt of power for
sale.
   ``Shoreham reduces our potential vulnerability to insecure
imports,'' Watkins said.
   Lichtblau and others say the key link in the nation's defense
against an oil supply disruption is the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, the government's underground stockpile of crude oil that
now totals 566 billion barrels, equal to nearly three months of
imports. The government is continuing to add to the reserve.
   Another factor working in the favor of oil-importing countries
is a trend toward less reliance by Middle East producers on
shipments through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage that Iran
several times has threatened to close. Iraq and Saudi Arabia have
been building overland pipelines to the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean in order to reduce their vulnerability to a cutoff of
Persian Gulf shipping.

   When George Bush coined the phrase ``kinder, gentler nation,''
he likely didn't know it would catch on. And on, and on, and on.
   In Detroit, new road signs admonish motorists to be ``kinder,
gentler, safer drivers.'' In Windsor, Ontario, a strip joint
advertises itself as a ``kinder, gentler adult entertainment
center.''
   Two weeks ago in Phoenix _ one year after he was impeached for
misusing funds and obstructing justice _ former Gov. Evan Mecham
vowed to run again and lead ``a kindler, gentler Arizona.''
   And in South Carolina, plumber Curt Whisennant has erected a
billboard on U.S. 1 in Columbia advertising his ABCOE Plumbing Co.
as a ``kinder, gentler plumbing company.''
   That may not have been what the now-president Bush had in mind
when candidate Bush first used the phrase in his acceptance speech
at the Republican National Convention last August.
   The ``kinder and gentler'' saying and Bush's ``thousand points
of light'' remark frequently have been lampooned by cartoonists and
others who have poked fun at the attempt at presidential poetry.
   But the phrase isn't without fans.
   ``I think it's probably going to be more successful than
`Where's the Beef?''' said Charlie Claggett, chief creative officer
for the advertising agency D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles in St.
Louis.
   ``Where's the Beef'' was the Wendy's hamburger restaurant slogan
co-opted during a 1984 presidential candidate debate by Walter
Mondale against fellow Democratic hopeful Gary Hart.
   ``The trend today is toward neo-traditional values. When Bush
made that speech, I thought, `My God, this man is reading the same
research we are.' And, of course, he is,'' Claggett said.
   Even so, Claggett said, ``I wouldn't dare go over to
Anheuser-Busch and suggest they advertise a `kinder, gentler beer.'
How kind and gentle can we be, anyway?''
   The phrase ``meets a desperate human need at a time when you can
step out of your house in Washington, D.C., and get shot down by
cocaine sellers,'' said Ray Browne, head of the popular culture
department at Bowling Green State University in Ohio.
   ``We're looking for something to save us from ourselves,''
Browne said. ``It's a Madison Avenue phrase. I don't know who
cooked it up, but it's tremendous.''
   It was Bush's idea, said B.J. Cooper, deputy White House press
secretary.
   ``It seemed to capture the kind of tone he wanted for his
presidency,'' Cooper said. ``He's often joked about it. ... But
he's also very well-defined what those two phrases are supposed to
mean.''
   That's nonsense, said Browne.
   ``This is more than a rhetorical honeymoon _ it's a deliberate
attempt to grab an element of human emotion and exploit it,'' he
said, conceding: ``I don't know what ... it means.''
   Jack Mariutce, executive creative director for DDB Needham
Worldwide in New York City, agreed: ``Slogans like this are like
Chinese food. They're good but they leave you hungry for something
with more substance later.''
   Hungry or not, the phrase is finding varying degrees of usage in
serious matters.
   In February, U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh vowed to take
a ``rougher, tougher attitude'' toward violent drug traffickers to
achieve Bush's goal of a ``kinder, gentler America.''
   And in New Orleans this month, students at Tulane and Loyola
Universities wrote Bush that their attempts to rescue nine monkeys
from a primate research center were their contributions to a
``kinder, gentler nation.''
   When Arizona's Republican party passed a resolution last year
declaring the United States a Christian nation, House Minority
Leader Art Hamilton said Republicans probably misunderstood Bush
and thought he had called for a kinder, more gentile nation.
   Others, however, insist that ``kinder and gentler'' is
completely overworked and should be avoided as the worst of cliches.
   The phrase has been nominated for next year's Dishonour List of
Words Banished from the English Language, compiled annually at Lake
Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., spokesman
Bill Crawford said. Bush's ``read my lips'' quote made the 1989
list.
   ``I'd say it's got a good shot at making the list, because one
of the criteria is overuse,'' Crawford said.

<HEAD>Labor Keeping A High Profile, Seeking To Gain From Recent Good Will</HEAD>

   Lane Kirkland sees the ``sanctification of
greed'' he attributes to the Reagan years beginning to crumble,
bringing favorable winds to the sails of the movement he often
refers to as a ship.
   ``I think there is perhaps the beginning of some change in
climate,'' the AFL-CIO president said in an interview last week.
``We've been beating against some fairly strong winds, but I think
the ship is sound and seaworthy. And winds change.''
   His is a view cautiously shared by other labor leaders, who in
recent weeks have found themselves awash with good news, a rare
tiding in a decade the American labor movement would prefer to
forget.
   Few labor leaders expect a sudden turnaround of the decline of
the 1980s, during which membership in unions has dropped by 3
million to 17 million and the percentage of workers who are union
members dropped from 23 percent in 1980 to 16.8 percent last year.
   But many believe the passing of the Reagan administration and
labor's recent high profile may help unions halt their slide and
improve their public standing.
   ``I think the American people are listening to what we are
saying and, yes, I think things are progressing,'' United Auto
Workers President Owen Bieber said.
   But Kirkland cautions against reading too much into recent
developments.
   ``We of course swim in a sea of public opinion that helps us and
hurts us and is valuable but I do not think that we can rely upon
external trends or perceptions or fortunes to build the labor
movement,'' he said. ``Our strength comes from within.''
   Still, it's hard not to notice labor's presence these days.
   Eastern Airlines has been virtually grounded for two months by a
Machinists strike that in itself has buoyed the labor movement
because of overwhelming solidarity among traditionally fractious
airline unions. A Harris poll released last week found that 60
percent of respondents supported the strikers.
   The labor-backed effort to raise the minimum wage has become the
first domestic policy showdown between Congress and President Bush,
with polls showing public opinion squarely behind efforts to end
the nine-year freeze in the floor wage.
   Unions are feeling better at the bargaining table as well.
   Two unions representing more than a half-million
telecommunications workers at AT&amp;T and regional telephone companies
are engaged in the largest round of collective bargaining this
year, national steel-industry contract talks are under way and
labor last week won a National Labor Relations Board ruling
expected to help unions organize the growing health care work force.
   Also, the Teamsters recently settled a racketeering suit with
the government, bringing fresh negative reports about alleged mob
influence on the union but promises for reform as well. The
settlement averted what would have been a lengthy trial likely to
tarnish labor's image regardless of its outcome.
   There is more to come.
   The minimum wage is just the first priority on a lengthy labor
agenda that also includes proposals for parental leave, child care,
health care, curbs on mergers and buyouts and worker-safety issues.
Most of these are ``safe'' issues _ those with public support.
   On tap for April 28 is a nationwide ``Workers Memorial Day''
during which unions will stage events in 17 states and the District
of Columbia to highlight workplace hazards.
   And labor's considerable political war chest will be directed in
the next two years on state races _ for governorships and
legislative seats _ in hopes of gaining powerful influence on the
redistricting that will follow the 1990 Census.
   The labor movement even is picking up its belated efforts to
join the TV age, seeking to foster good will with ad campaigns,
including a new Auto Workers series questioning the long-term
effects of mergers and moving jobs overseas.
   The ads make a pitch for patriotism and recount America's
industrial heydays.
   ``We wanted to show that what we're really concerned about is
not just our own well-being but the well-being of our country,''
said Bieber.
   In addition, the AFL-CIO is reviving its ``Union Yes''
television campaign this month, spots in which a handful of
entertainers promote union membership.
   Whether the high profile will result in substantive gains for
labor is anybody's guess.
   But Kirkland has no illusions of trouble-free days ahead,
regardless of whether labor gains from its recent prominence.
   ``Ups and downs have happened all throughout our history and
will in the future, I'm sure,'' he said. ``We've learned to live
with that.''

   America's auto workers are taking on Wall
Street and corporate power brokers with a new advertising campaign
attacking ``merger-mania'' and movement of jobs oversees.
   There's another obvious but unstated goal as well: to foster
good will toward unions.
   ``American Business Should Put America's Future First'' is the
title of the $4 million campaign begun this month by the United
Auto Workers in an effort to sway public opinion in favor of
labor-backed efforts to curb mergers and acquisitions.
   The campaign comes at a time when the labor movement has an
unusually high profile because of a number of recent events,
including the Eastern Airlines strike and labor-backed efforts to
raise the minimum wage.
   But there's no mention of the word ``union'' in the text of the
TV ads, although labor's ``Union Yes'' logo appears on the final
frame.
   Instead, the UAW makes a pitch to patriotism, with newsreel
footage of products manufactured in the United States in the past
40 years as well as shots of auto workers on an assembly line.
   ``Producing quality products has always been one of our nation's
great strengths,'' the narrator says in one ad as viewers get a
glimpse of 1950s clock radios, televisions and refrigerators. ``Our
auto industry put this country on wheels. American pioneered the
electronic age. Our computer technology brought us a whole new
world of information.''
   The picture then shifts to a frantic floor session on Wall
Street as the narrator continues:
   ``But in the '80s, some of the best-known products of American
business have been takeovers, junk bonds and making money by moving
money. Let's turn it around. We need to put America's future
first.''
   In the second spot two UAW engine assemblers talk of quality
products and good-paying jobs before the camera turns to UAW
President Owen Bieber.
   ``But some corporations are putting short-term profits ahead of
long-term strength,'' Bieber says. ``Moving jobs overseas, mergers
and takeovers that are unproductive. They don't help build America.
Investing and training in top-notch facilities: that's good for all
of us.''
   A related print ad campaign features corporate executives
surrounding a craps table and betting company assets.
   The TV spots are running in two dozen markets, primarily where
UAW workers are concentrated but also in Washington, New York,
Chicago and Los Angeles and nationally on several cable channels.
   The print ads are to run in a variety of newspapers, magazines
and business journals.

<HEAD>Plane Crash, Dead Canaries Expand Grand Jury Probe Into Southern
Co.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of an executive in a plane crash and
the discovery of dead canaries at a lawyer's home have added a
strange twist to a federal tax-fraud investigation of Southern Co.,
a big Southeast utility.
   A grand jury is investigating allegations that Gulf Power Co., a
Southern subsidiary, forced suppliers to make campaign
contributions to a variety of Florida politicians.
   The utility allegedly reimbursed the suppliers and covered the
payments with inflated or bogus invoices, according to recent
published reports that quoted grand jury witnesses.
   The investigation began after an accountant for Georgia Power
Co., another Southern subsidiary, told the Internal Revenue Service
last year that the utility may have accounted improperly for spare
parts. The Securities and Exchange Commission also is investigating.
   Now, the grand jury has widened its inquiry to include the April
10 plane crash that killed three.
   Among the victims was Jake Horton, a Gulf Power executive who
had just been told by his employers that he might be disciplined
for accounting irregularities. Investigators haven't determined the
cause of the crash, but one witness said the grand jury asked him
about the possibility of sabotage or suicide.
   ``Any allegations that what we're doing was related to the air
crash we would certainly be concerned with,'' said U.S. Attorney
Robert L. Barr Jr., whose office is conducting the investigation in
Atlanta.
   Barr also indicated there may be ties between the grand jury
probe and the discovery of dead canaries at the homes and office of
Fred Levin, a Pensacola, Fla., lawyer who has worked for Gulf Power.
   Levin had met with Horton recently. The executive believed he
had been targeted for indictment and told Levin he wanted to clear
his name, according to Levin.
   Barr wouldn't say whether the grand jury had been investigating
Horton before the crash.
   Atlanta-based Southern Co. brings electricity to 11 million
customers through five subsidiaries in four Southeast states. Its
revenues last year were $2.1 billion.
   Horton was senior vice president of Pensacola-based Gulf Power.
He and two company pilots were killed when the plane crashed into a
Pensacola apartment complex 90 seconds after taking off for Atlanta.
   Allan R. Barton, president of Mississippi Power Co., another
Southern subsidiary, said the grand jury asked him last week if
sabotage or suicide could have been involved. Barton said he didn't
have any clues.
   The National Transportation Safety Board said flight tapes show
that a fire broke out in the cockpit before the crash, but no cause
has been established.
   ``We have not uncovered anything that would indicate any type of
sabotage so far,'' said NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz.
Nevertheless, the FBI is checking for any sign of criminal intent,
he said.
   Shortly before boarding the plane, Horton had met with Gulf
Power President Doug McCrary and Dr. Reed Bell, chairman of its
audit committee.
   The meeting was held to discuss ``concern over Mr. Horton's
possible circumvention of company policies and procedures and his
supervision of processing of invoices from vendors,'' Southern Co.
said in a statement.
   The audit committee recommended Horton be fired or suspended,
but no action was taken at the meeting, the company said.
   Last week, canaries with broken necks turned up outside the
office and two homes of Levin.
   ``I don't know what else I've done to deserve a dead canary,''
Levin told Atlanta's WSB-TV. ``I am deeply, deeply concerned, and I
don't even stay at home now.''
   Carter Haynes, a Gulf Power spokesman, said Levin's firm had
represented the utility for about five years in personal injury
cases. Haynes said he could recall no recent case that might have
inspired someone to leave a dead canary as a warning to Levin.
   Authorities haven't established a motive and have no suspect on
the canaries, said Ray Barnes, special operations supervisor at the
Escambia County, Fla., sheriff's office.

   A Missouri abortion-regulation dispute in
which the Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday has generated
the most ``friend-of-the-court'' briefs ever submitted in one case.
   The justices are being asked to use the Missouri case to
overturn or substantially limit its 1973 decision legalizing
abortion.
   The landmark Roe vs. Wade decision, based on a woman's
constitutional right to privacy, said a woman's decision to have an
abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to
her and her doctor.
   The court said states may interfere in the abortion decision
during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and
may take steps only to protect fetal life in the third trimester
when the fetus can survive outside the womb.
   State authority to regulate abortions after the first trimester
was not made absolute, however.
   A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck down as
unconstitutional five key provisions of the Missouri law now under
scrutiny:
   _A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for
performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.
   _A ban on using taxpayer money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus reasonably
believed to be older than 19 weeks is viable, capable of surviving
outside the womb, by determining lung maturity and other testing.
   _A declaration that the ``life of each human begins at
conception.''
   Here are excerpts of some of the arguments raised in
friend-of-the-court briefs submitted to the justices. In all, the
court received 45 such briefs supporting the Missouri law and 33
briefs opposing it.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>SUPPORTING ARGUMENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _From the Bush administration: ``Roe vs. Wade, as the court is
well aware, has been intensely controversial from the day it was
decided. That controversy is more than simply a reflection of the
deep divisions in American society over the underlying question of
abortion. Rather, the controversy has, in substantial measure, been
a product of the decision itself.
   ``Roe rests on assumptions that are not firmly grounded in the
Constitution; it adopts an unworkable framework tying permissible
state regulation of abortion to particular periods in pregnancy;
and it has allowed courts to usurp the function of legislative
bodies in weighing competing social, ethical and scientific factors
in reaching a judgment as to how much state regulation is
appropriate in this sensitive area.''
   _From the International Right to Life Federation: ``In most
nations of the world, abortion policy has not been the subject of
constitutional intervention by a high court, remaining determined
by a wide variety of legislative schemes ... The democratic
compromises reached in developed Western nations are significantly
more protective of fetal life than is Roe vs. Wade.''
   _From the American Collegians for Life and the Catholic League
for Religious and Civil Rights: ``Under ... Roe, the states have an
important and legitimate interest in protecting fetal life from
conception until birth, which interest becomes compelling at
viability.
   ``If the states' interest in the protection of fetal life
becomes compelling at viability, it necessarily follows that the
states possess the ability to require that the point of viability
be determined. If the compelling nature of a state's interest in
unborn human life ... is to be anything more than illusory, then
Roe and its progeny should be read to permit those states desiring
to protect fetal life to require a physician to make a
determination, consistent with sound medical practice, as to
viability.''
   _From the National Right to Life Committee: ``Abortion
jurisprudence needs resolution after 16 years of turmoil. This
court attempted to resolve the matter in 1973. Time has proven the
effort a failure. This court is now confronted with the opportunity
to restore a proper interpretation to the Constitution, returning
this volatile matter of social policy to the proper fora _ the
state legislatures.''
   _From Feminists for Life: ``There is ample evidence in the
medical studies and public health statistics cited herein that the
unfettered right of abortion on demand foisted upon our society by
the court and by abortion advocates is a public health disaster the
proportion of which we are just beginning to uncover.''
   _From Focus on Family and the Family Research Council of
America: ``Changes in understanding and medical science will always
outpace the court's ability to respond. When this court's
precedents are rooted in science and not in the Constitution, as
was Roe's trimester framework, science is pitted against precedent,
and the prestige of this honorable institution suffers.
   ``This court can best protect the interests of our citizens by
abandoning the trimester approach as outmoded, unscientific and
constitutionally unworkable, and by recognizing that the states
have legitimate interests, existing throughout pregnancy, in
protecting the life of the mother and the unborn child.''
   _From the U.S. Catholic Conference: ``If the court seriously
seeks support for abortion decisions in the historical line of
privacy cases, it must reflect accurately that one person's
`liberty' is not `license' to control even one's own body where
another's interest could suffer or the common good be diminished.''
   _From the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association
of Evangelists, the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod and the
Christian Life Commission: ``It has been argued that state laws
prohibiting abortion unconstitutionally impose the religious
beliefs and views of one religion upon persons not adhering to
those views, thereby constituting an `establishment' of religion
prohibited by the First Amendment.
   ``We do not advocate the imposition of our religious views by
law in order to impose on others our religious beliefs. Rather,
those religious beliefs are ... deeply seated in the moral and
ethical system that forms the basis of much of the civil and
criminal law of this nation ... The fact that a state's law
coincides with a deeply held religious belief does not render that
law unconstitutional under the First Amendment.''
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OPPOSING ARGUMENTS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   _From the American Medical Association and other medical groups:
``This court has observed that viability is usually placed at about
seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks.
Since the improvements in health care have resulted in greater
survival of infants born at a gestational age of 24-28 weeks ...
The earliest point at which a fetus can survive is 23-24 weeks.''
   ``Thus, while substantial strides have occurred in saving
infants born between 24 and 28 weeks, the earliest point at which
an infant can survive has changed little.
   ``What the court found in 1973 is even more true today: the
medical risks to a woman of childbirth are greater than the risks
of abortion.''
   _From 167 scientists and physicians, including 11 Nobel
laureates: ``There is no scientific consensus that a human life
begins at conception, at a given stage of fetal development or at
birth. The question of `when a human life begins' cannot be
answered by reference to scientific principles like those with
which we predict planetary movement. The answer to that question
will depend on each individual's social, religious, philosophical,
ethical and moral beliefs and values.
   ``Assertions that viability has moved significantly earlier in
fetal development are flatly contrary to the scientific evidence.
Although advances in technology have improved the chances of
survival of premature birth within the range of 24 to 28 weeks, the
outer limit of viability at 24 weeks has not significantly changed.
   ``Roe vs. Wade has not been rendered obsolete by subsequent
advancements in science.''
   _From the American Psychological Association: ``Five major
reviews of the psychological and psychiatric literature published
between 1975 and 1989 all confirm that for the overwhelming
majority of women who undergo abortion, there are no long-term
negative emotional effects.
   ``When women experience regret, depression or guilt, such
feelings are mild and diminish rapidly without adversely affecting
general functioning. Severe emotional responses are rare, even in
young women. To the contrary, the great majority of women who have
had an abortion express feelings of relief.''
   _From the National Association of Public Hospitals: ``Through
its restrictions on the use of public facilities for the purpose of
performing or assisting an abortion and on the use of public funds
for the purpose of encouraging or counseling an abortion ...
Missouri has intruded deeply into the physician-patient
relationship.
   ``Missouri's restriction ... has the effect of prohibiting
constitutionally protected conduct, and it is therefore
unconstitutional.''
   _From Women (about 3,000) who have had abortions, a compendium
filed by the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and
Education Fund and the National Abortion Rights Action League:
``Women's privacy and liberty interests ... would be substantially
infringed upon by the provisions of the Missouri statute at issue.
The option of abortion ... is fundamental to women's lives, liberty
and their pursuit of happiness.''
   _From 281 American historians: ``At the time the federal
Constitution was adopted, abortion was known and not illegal.
Abortion was not uncommon in colonial America.
   ``A presumed interest in protecting fetal life does not justify
denying women their historic liberty to choose abortion.''

   Typhoons, earthquakes, drought and other natural
disasters killed 7,300 people and caused $27 billion in damage in
China last year, an official newspaper reported today.
   Civil Affairs Minister Cui Naifu said 1988 was China's worst for
natural disasters in the past decade, the China Daily said.
   Cui said the death toll was up 34 percent over 1987, while the
number of injured, 70,000, was an increase of 75 percent. About 230
million people, more than a fifth of China's population, were
affected by disasters, he said.
   More than 600 people died in floods that swamped large areas of
southern and northeastern China, Cui said.
   There were 25 earthquakes measuring 5 or more on the Richter
scale, with the most damaging, in southwest China's Yunnan Province
last November, killing 730 people and injuring 4,000.
   The most devastating of numerous typhoons to strike the
southeastern coast killed 120 in Zhejiang province in August.
   Cui said drought affected 813 million acres of farmland
throughout the country, and that 378 million acres produced no
crops because of dry weather.

   Republican Craig Thomas, who claims he's
the rightful heir to former Rep. Dick Cheney, has built momentum in
the final days of his race against Democrat John Vinich for
Wyoming's lone House seat.
   Officials of both campaigns say their polls show Thomas has
pulled even or slightly ahead of Vinich. Voters on Wednesday will
select a successor to Cheney, who resigned to become defense
secretary.
   The two are vying to represent the nation's least populous
state, but the contest's importance is far greater than the number
of voters suggests.
   The GOP is seeking to rebound from defeats in two special House
races in Indiana and Alabama during the past month. Most
embarrassing was the loss of Vice President Dan Quayle's old House
seat in Indiana to Democrat Jill Long last month.
   Republicans have put money and manpower behind Thomas, including
visits by Sens. Bob Dole of Kansas and Alan Simpson of Wyoming. But
Vinich has been quick to criticize the GOP effort, suggesting that
Thomas wasn't running his own campaign.
   Thomas, a 55-year-old state representative who lost two races
for state treasurer, has criticized Vinich as a liberal dependent
on support from organized labor. The AFL-CIO is backing the
Democrat.
   The election will demonstrate ``whether or not we want to
continue to have the kind of moderate conservative representation
that we had with Dick Cheney and we have with our senators, or
whether we want to take a rather marked change of philosophy,''
Thomas said.
   Vinich, 38, is bidding to become the state's first Democrat to
sit in Congress since Cheney replaced Teno Roncalio in 1978. Vinich
entered the race with better name recognition. The state senator
fell just 1,322 votes short of upsetting Republican Sen. Malcolm
Wallop last fall.
   Vinich said he would be more able to instruct the Democratic
majority in the House on Wyoming concerns. He claimed he has been
promised a seat on the House Agriculture Committee if he wins.
   Thomas said he had been guaranteed a seat on the Interior
Committee.

<HEAD>Iowa Explosion Investigators Will Seek Evidence of Human, Mechanical
Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Navy investigators will be looking at all
possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to
determine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard the
battleship USS Iowa, officials say.
   It could take months before the probe is completed and the
results released publicly, Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Alan Dooley
said Sunday.
   A seven-member team of investigators boarded the battleship a
day after the explosion flashed through the Iowa's No. 2 gun turret
on Wednesday.
   ``They're looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical
error, or anything technical,'' said Lt. Janet Mescus, a
spokeswoman at the Navy's information center at Norfolk, Va., the
ship's home port. The Iowa returned to Norfolk on Sunday.
   ``They're moving as quickly as they can,'' Lt. Mescus said, but
added, ``They want to be thorough and that takes time.''
   Dooley said the investigation would be ``fairly complex''
because there were no witnesses. There were 11 survivors inside the
turret, all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ship's
magazines, the Navy said.
   Dooley said no information would be released until the probe is
completed, and the Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of
the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.
   But The New York Times reported Sunday that Navy teams who
entered the turret immediately after the blast found the No. 2
gun's breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that
the gun was to have fired still there.
   The Times cited unidentified sources as saying this indicated
the explosion occurred while the bags containing 550 pounds of
propellant powder were still being loaded into the gun.
   Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the
bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the
newspaper said. They said flame and hot gases from the blast went
down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the
guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
   The Navy on Sunday released an amateur videotape of the
explosion, which was made by an officer on the bridge of the Iowa
who wanted to record the firing of the guns.
   The investigation team is headed by Rear Adm. Richard D.
Milligan, former commanding officer of the battleship USS New
Jersey, and it also includes experts on gunnery and weapons.

<TEXT>
   A national Citizens Committee of
opposition groups, led by Solidarity, has approved a list of
independent candidates to run in legislative elections set for June.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, opening Sunday's meeting in a
packed lecture hall at Warsaw University, appealed for unity in the
new situation of open elections in communist Poland.
   ``Let's forget about group or individual interests,'' said
Walesa, who reiterated that he would not run for the new Senate or
for the Sejm _ the current unicameral parliament.
   An agreement between the opposition and government on April 5
lifted the seven-year ban on Solidarity and set the framework for
the most democratic elections in postwar Poland.
   Opposition candidates will be able to run for all 100 seats in
the new Senate and for 161 seats in the 460-member Sejm.
   The Citizens Committee selection of 252 candidates left nine
vacancies in the allotted 261 Senate and Sejm seats.
   Solidarity spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz told a news conference
after the four-hour meeting that those vacancies would be filled in
the next few days.
   The elections are scheduled for June 4 with a runoff on June 18.
   Solidarity, the first free trade union movement in the Soviet
bloc when it was chartered in the fall of 1980, was suspended with
a December 1981 military crackdown and subsequently outlawed.
   It was officially reinstated April 17 by a government driven to
seek opposition cooperation by a crippled economy.
   Walesa said Sunday he would not run for the legislature because
he wanted to be free to lead Solidarity and the opposition.
   But many of the country's leading union and political activists
plan to run, including longtime Walesa associates Bogdan Lis and
Leszek Kaczynski; Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron; historian and
Walesa adviser Bronislaw Geremek; political essayist Adam Michnik
and film director Andrzej Wajda.
   The Solidarity leader from the southwestern city of Wroclaw,
Wladyslaw Frasyniuk, and his Warsaw counterpart, Zbigniew Bujak,
have decided not to run and to concentrate on union matters.
   Onyszkiewicz said a draft of the opposition's platform was being
edited following Sunday's discussions.
   Kuron told the news conference that the opposition faces
tremendous pressure in preparing for the elections.
   ``Social knowledge about the procedure of these elections is
close to zero. We have to start our work on that very soon,'' he
said.
   Walesa, who had just returned from a four-day trip to Rome where
he appealed for Western aid to rebuild the economy, predicted
trying times for the opposition.
   ``One thing is ending and the new one has not started
functioning yet,'' he said. ``It is a new situation in which we
have to combine people of struggle with those of work. And that's
why I strongly appeal to you: Let's forget about group or
individual interests.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Chief Outlines Plans To Delay Stealth Bomber, Cut Star Wars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is calling for
cuts in proposed Star Wars spending and a delay in the B-2 stealth
bomber to meet the $299.2 billion Pentagon budget the Bush
administration and congressional leaders have agreed upon.
   Cheney, in a television interview on Sunday, also said President
Bush has decided to move ahead with two kinds of mobile strategic
missiles, combining the MX and the Midgetman missiles in the
nation's defense.
   The defense secretary is scheduled to appear before Congress on
Tuesday to detail the cuts.
   Bush decided to cut spending on Star Wars, formally known as the
Strategic Defense Initiative or SDI, to $4.6 billion for fiscal
year 1990, down from the $5.9 billion proposed by President Reagan.
Over the next five years, Bush would spend $33 billion on SDI,
compared to Reagan's proposed $40 billion.
   Cheney said the president will shift the focus of SDI from
deployment sometime in the 1990s to research on a more advanced
system, known as ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting of thousands of
orbiting satellites.
   ``SDI is alive and well, but like everything else, it has to fit
into a reduced budget,'' Cheney said on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press''
program.
   Bush turned down Cheney's recommendation to move the nation's 50
MX missiles, with 10-warheads apiece, from silos to deployment on
railroad cars rather than develop a single-warhead missile to be
based on trucks.
   The single-warhead missile is backed by national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft and the chairmen of the Senate and House
Armed Services Committees, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and Rep. Les
Aspin, D-Wis.
   ``What I recommended to the president was that we go forward
with the rail-garrison system. Brent Scowcroft recommended we go
forward with the small ICBM. The president basically said, `Try to
do both,''' Cheney said.
   ``But instead of doing both simultaneously, we will try to
sequence them. That is, we will do rail garrison first, try to put
a little bit of money in the budget next year for the small ICBM,
and then as we get the rail garrison deployed, we will start to
ramp up on the small ICBM,'' he said.
   The small ICBM, known as the Midgetman, ultimately would cost
$24 billion for 500 warheads, versus $5.4 billion for the same
number of warheads aboard the rail-mobile MX, according to recent
congressional estimates.
   The defense secretary said he had decided to delay work for one
year on another strategic weapon, the stealth bomber, designed to
elude enemy targeting radar. Original plans called for 132 of
stealth bombers, and recent reports have estimated the cost at $500
million apiece, making it the costliest U.S. warplane ever.
   ``We're going to postpone actually going into full procurement
on it because I'm not comfortable with the program yet. There are a
lot of technical problems with it and it is extremely expensive,''
he said.
   Turning to the Navy, Cheney said the administration plans to
keep all four World War II vintage battleships in the fleet despite
an explosion last week aboard one of them, the USS Iowa, that
killed 47 sailors.
   He said investigators have not yet determined what caused one of
the 16-inch guns on the middle turret of the Iowa to explode last
Wednesday, but the event did not shake his support for keeping
battleships in the fleet.
   ``It may be a matter of several months before we have all the
details,'' said Cheney. ``But we will do our best to get to the
bottom of it and find out exactly what did happen.''
   The defense secretary said the battleships, brought out of
retirement by Reagan during his military buildup, would be used as
surrogates for aircraft carriers, which he has decided to cut from
the 15 envisioned by Reagan to 14 by retiring older ones as new
models enter service.

<TEXT>
   In central Washington's Yakima Valley,
where fruit trees bloom in blazing sunshine, fear has taken root
because of an outbreak of a contagious disease that has killed six
people this year.
   Twenty people, including four infants, have become ill with
meningococcal bacteria, which can lead to meningitis and other
illnesses.
   Doctors are swamped, firefighters worried about giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, parents pulled their children out of
preschools, and about 18,000 people have been vaccinated.
   The greatest worry is that there is no effective vaccine,
therefore no protection, for children under age 1.
   In Wapato, a poor town of 3,300 on the Yakima Indian
Reservation, two infants have died and three children have become
sick from the disease.
   ``The group of people dying and being hospitalized is the group
we can't do anything for,'' said Fire Chief Tom Kehm, who has
helped set up emergency vaccination clinics. ``They can do
nothing.''
   The bacteria has mostly struck poor Hispanics and American
Indians, living in crowded, unsanitary conditions.
   It is carried in the nose and throat and is passed through
sneezing and other secretions from the nose and mouth. It is not
considered highly contagious.
   However, stopping the spread has been difficult because carriers
older than age 25 usually do not become ill, but can transmit the
disease to children.
   The outbreak appeared to be over in mid-March, when there were
no new cases reported for about two weeks, prompting Yakima County
Health District director Dr. Bob Atwood to cautiously predict it
had run its course.
   But a 4-month-old Wapato infant died on March 24, sparking a new
round of mass vaccinations.
   Three weeks passed without a new case, but the 19th case _ a
5-month-old Wapato girl _ was diagnosed April 13, renewing fears
and frustrating medical workers.
   And on Friday, health officers in nearby Franklin County
announced that a 5-month-old boy who had been hospitalized and
released was confirmed as the outbreak's 20th case. The boy had
moved from Yakima on April 14, the day before he became ill, said
Dr. Larry Jecha, county health officer.
   Atwood is no longer willing to predict when the outbreak will be
over.
   But the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which
has been monitoring the outbreak, believes it may be winding down.
   Dr. Jay Wenger of CDC's meningitis center, said meningococcal
disease typically fades away with a few sporadic cases.
   The Yakima outbreak started with two cases in January, exploded
with 12 in February, followed by four in March and two so far in
April.
   ``That's sort of a classical wind down,'' Wenger said.
   The disease is most common in poor African countries like Chad,
Sudan and Ethiopia, where Wenger said epidemics sicken people at a
rate of 500 per 100,000 population.
   In this country, there are about 3,000 cases and 300 deaths each
year.
   Meningococcus has been an unpredictable disease since it was
first described in Switzerland in 1805. Cases have been rising
steadily in the United States, up from 1,476 in 1978 to more than
3,000 per year now.
   Wenger said the CDC does not rank clusters, because of the
difficulty in defining which cases are definitely related.
   But the Yakima outbreak may be the largest per capita since a
1975-76 cluster in nearby Seattle made more than 40 people sick,
mostly American Indians and skid road bums, Wenger said.
   Yakima Pediatric Associates, whose doctors have cared for many
of the stricken, has received up to 1,000 calls per day from
anxious parents in recent weeks, said Dr. Bruce Hudson.
   People are quicker to bring in their children, he said, because
the disease symptoms are similar to a common cold. It starts with a
fever and progresses to vomiting, lethargy, stiff neck and
irritability. There is also a purple rash.
   Kehm said firefighters in Wapato worried about giving
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation until they learned the protective mask
they use to prevent AIDS contraction also protects them from
meningococcus.

<HEAD>Gas Shoots Up A Nickel At The Pump In Last Two Weeks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Tanker Spill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline pump prices rose nearly a nickel a
gallon nationwide to their highest levels since 1986 because of the
Alaskan oil spill and other supply constraints, an industry analyst
said.
   Prices are likely to continue rising in coming weeks because of
the supply pinch and the seasonal increase in driving, said Trilby
Lundberg.
   The latest Lundberg Survey of 12,000 gas stations found overall
prices rose an average 4.86 cents to $1.1544 per gallon from April
8 to April 21. That was the highest price since early 1986, Ms.
Lundberg said.
   The increases reflect higher wholesale costs caused by the spill
from the Exxon Valdez, a drop in OPEC production, a fire at a
Northern California refinery and higher federal clean-air standards
for fuel, she said.
   The latest jump followed a 10-cents-a-gallon increase two weeks
ago in the immediate aftermath of the oil spill.
   Self-service prices on April 21 were $1.0602 for regular
unleaded, $1.2086 for premium unleaded and $1.0476 for regular
leaded. Full-service prices were $1.3147 for regular unleaded,
$1.4279 for premium unleaded and $1.2837 for regular leaded,
according to the survey.

<TEXT>
   Dreams have finally started coming true for
Joe Clay, the school bus driver who was rediscovered three years
ago by European teen-agers craving '50s rock 'n' roll.
   Eight European concert tours later, Clay _ also known as C.J.
Cheramie to his neighbors and the students and teachers on his bus
routes _ is looking at the possibility of a movie of his life and
maybe a book.
   A one-year option on his life story was bought recently by Fries
Entertainment in Los Angeles.
   ``This is the same production people that did `La Bamba' and
`Officer and a Gentleman.' It's kind of getting a little exciting
now,'' Cheramie said. ``This is the best thing that ever happened
so far.''
   Cheramie, 51, started singing at 40 years ago, and had a brief
career singing rock 'n' roll. In 1957, he recorded nine songs,
appeared on the ``Ed Sullivan Show'' and performed with Elvis
Presely at the Louisiana Hayride in Shreveport.
   He went to New York but grew frustrated with a career that
wasn't moving and a manager who wouldn't give it a push.
   He came home, worked in a band, and 15 years ago began driving
the bus.
   Then, in 1986, an English music promoter found him at his modest
two-story house in a New Orleans suburb, and sent him on a concert
tour to England, Holland and Sweden. It was a trip to success such
as Clay had never known.
   ``It's hard to come home and explain what happens to me over
there,'' he said. ``I really become Joe Clay. I really stay on the
clouds. I'm on a natural high.''
   He recently resigned from his bus-driving job because finding a
substitute while he was on tour had become a problem.
   He's been to Europe twice this year and will release a record
with two new songs next month. In September, he will return to tour
and to make an album in Holland. In December, there's another tour.
   Two weeks ago, the Country Music Association released on record,
tape and compact disc a collection of vintage 1956-1959 rockabilly
music, including Cheramie doing his first nine songs.
   News of the possible movie came a few weeks ago, although the
project is not definite.
   Cheramie said he doesn't regret having missed the gold three
decades ago.
   ``It's so much better now. I don't think I could have handled it
then,'' he said.

<HEAD>Survivor Of Father's Rampage Turns 3 Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PETALUMA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The little girl who survived her
father's confessed killing spree was marking her third birthday
today with greetings and 500 toys sent from around the country to
the hospital where she is recovering.
   Petaluma Valley Hospital planned a quiet celebration with cake
and ice cream for Carmina Salcido, her relatives and staff members
who have cared for the girl since she was found with her throat
slit at a trash dump.
   Carmina has received numerous birthday cards and presents,
including the toys and clothes, said spokeswoman Mary Frost.
   Her father, Ramon Salcido, 28, remained in the Sonoma County
jail under a 24-hour suicide watch, and awaiting a May 5 hearing to
enter a plea to seven counts of murder.
   Salcido is accused of killing his wife, Angela, a co-worker, his
mother-in-law and her two young daughters, and his two other
daughters, Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1. He confessed to the crimes
after his arrest in Mexico, authorities said.
   Most of the victims were found April 14 but Salcido's daughters
were found the next day at the dump.
   Carmina's condition continued to improve after another operation
Friday, when surgeons removed a feeding tube and inspected her
wound for infection. Hospital spokeswoman Fran Adams said the girl
was in good condition on Sunday.
   Carmina and her two sisters may not have been the last victims
of the killing spree, as initially believed.
   The Santa Rosa Press Democrat, citing unidentified law
enforcement sources, said Sunday investigators now believe the
three girls were actually the first victims in the April 14 rampage.
   Sheriff's sources told the newspaper that it now appears the
girls had their throats slashed about 6 a.m. at the dump, before
Salcido allegedly tossed them over an embankment one at a time.
   If the new account is accurate, Carmina was at the dump for more
than 30 hours before she was found.
   Salcido is then believed to have driven to Cotati to kill his
mother-in-law and her two daughters, returned to his home in Boyes
Hot Springs to kill his wife, and then to Grand Cru Winery, where
he allegedly fatally shot his co-worker, Tracy Toovey, the
newspaper reported.
   The killing spree ended a few minutes later when Salcido
allegedly shot and wounded another co-worker, Kenneth Butti, and
tried to shoot Butti's wife, Terri, according to the newspaper's
sources.
   Salcido reportedly provided details to investigators while he
was being brought back from Mexico late last week.

<HEAD>Charges Against BIA Agent Spark Conflict Over Tribal Authority</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than a century after frontier
Indian wars ceased on the plains and valleys of Montana, native
Americans are embroiled in a new battle for independence against
the federal government.
   On the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation in north-central Montana, a
tribal prosecutor has filed criminal charges against the chief
agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, accusing him of interfering
in tribal affairs by threatening not to recognize an elected tribal
government.
   The case has implications nationwide for Indian tribes' power to
control their own governments and reservations.
   ``My whole idea in this thing was, `How much authority does this
guy have?''' said Chippewa-Cree Tribal Prosecutor Jim Morsette.
``This is a problem not only in Rocky Boy, but on all the
reservations.''
   The federal government responded by suing Morsette, a tribal
councilman and the chief tribal judge in federal court.
   The government acknowledges Indian reservations are sovereign
territory, but it claims tribal courts have no jurisdiction over
BIA personnel performing official duties.
   U.S. District Judge Paul Hatfield of Great Falls should decide
the issue later this year.
   Most tribes have their own constitutions and laws, approved by
the federal government.
   Yet many tribal programs on reservations _ law enforcement,
schools, road maintenance, welfare _ are operated under contract
with the BIA, which provides the money and acts as overseer. The
agency also has the power to revoke contracts and run programs
itself.
   ``When it's not operating the way it's supposed to, we step in
and take over,'' said Richard Whitesell, the bureau's area director
in Billings.
   On poorer reservations like Rocky Boys, where unemployment runs
at about 75 percent among 2,400 resident tribal members, federal
money is the main source of employment and income and the bureau's
authority carries clout.
   Despite the bureau's often pervasive role in tribal affairs, its
stated goal is to help the tribes become more independent. Morsette
and his allies say that isn't happening on the Rocky Boys
Reservation.
   Their complaints center on Rocky Boys BIA Superintendent Ken
Davis.
   On Jan. 9, Morsette charged Davis in tribal court with three
misdemeanors: obstructing justice, cruelty to animals and contempt
of court.
   Davis refused to appear in court, saying it had no jurisdiction
over him as a bureau employee. Chief Tribal Judge Russell Standing
Rock issued an arrest warrant, but a federal judge agreed to a
government request and blocked the charges until the jurisdictional
question is settled.
   The contempt-of-court charge is the most significant. It accuses
Davis of interfering with a tribal court order involving alleged
voting fraud in a June 1988 tribal election.
   Davis told a tribal election official the bureau might not
recognize the tribal government elected under the court order,
according to court records. Without the bureau's recognition, a
tribe could lose its contracts.
   Morsette said Davis' comments were improper and illegal and
portrayed an outdated, paternalistic attitude toward Indians.
   ``It's the attitude that the BIA has always had: `We know what's
best for you. ... You're still our Indians,''' Morsette said.
``Well, (our) constitution is for us to interpret, in our court.''
   Davis and government attorneys maintain he was merely performing
his job as adviser to the tribe and is therefore immune from legal
action by the tribe.
   ``He said, `There are some problems I see. I recognize your
authority to resolve them, but you need to get them resolved,'''
said Roger W. Thomas, an Interior Department attorney.
   The pursuit of criminal charges in tribal court against a BIA
superintendent appears unique, but the government argues that the
matter is a civil case. Federal courts have ruled in previous civil
cases that tribal courts have no jurisdiction over federal
employees acting in official capacity.
   Morsette and Standing Rock are paying their legal fees without
support from the tribal council. They say it will be tough to win
against the government and all its resources, but add that the case
is too important to drop because of its implications for tribal
independence.
   ``I'm kind of bullheaded this way, but I have always stressed to
my people ... that we're the boss _ the Indians, the tribe,'' said
Standing Rock. ``We tell the BIA what to do.''

   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat will make his first
official visit to France early in May, meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand and other government officials, Foreign
Minister Roland Dumas announced.
   News reports have said the Palestine Liberation Organization
leader's visit has been set for May 2, but Dumas said only that it
would come in the month's ``early days.''
   Interviewed on French television on Sunday, Dumas said France
remains ``a close friend of Israel,'' which has criticized the
planned visit. French Jewish groups also have protested the
invitation, which was announced previously without any date being
set.
   ``France takes into account Israel's concerns, but also the
reality of the Palestinian people,'' Dumas said.
   He said the actions of the Palestine National Council last
November in Algiers and statements by Arafat in Geneva accepting
the right of Israel to exist and renouncing terrorism made the
visit possible.
   Dumas noted that Arafat already has made official visits to
Greece, Spain and Italy and has been received by Pope John Paul II.
   Dumas and other French foreign ministers have met with Arafat on
several occasions, but never before in Paris.
   After Arafat's statements in Geneva, the United States dropped
its ban on all contacts with the PLO.
   Since then representatives of the group in Tunis, Tunisia, where
the PLO is headquartered, have met several times with U.S.
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau.

<HEAD>Hotel Where Steinbeck Lounged To Be Demolished</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALINAS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city is planning to demolish the
Hotel Cominos, where a young John Steinbeck caroused. He later
wrote about the hotel in ``The Long Valley,'' ``Dubious Battle''
and ``East of Eden.''
   The gray cast-stone and stucco hotel _ with its grand ballroom,
marble fireplace, hardwood floors and frosted glass chandeliers
with gold leaf trim _ was a center of activity when Steinbeck's
hometown had a population of 4,000.
   Today, the hotel stands abandoned and rubble-filled and
officials in this city of 100,000 residents say they have more
important thing to spend money on.
   They decided earlier this month to tear it down soon.
   ``Steinbeck used to go down to the hotel,'' recalled Betty
Brusa, who briefly met him when she was a girl in the 1920s. ``He
belonged to what was called the `rat pack.' They broke up the lobby
one night throwing things at one another.''
   Steinbeck, born in Salinas in 1902, moved away to college and
went on to win a Nobel Prize for literature in 1962, six years
before his death. He was in town long enough to see what opened as
the Abbott House in 1874 transformed into the Cominos.
   The hotel declined in the 1950s and began a steep slide in the
1960s. It closed in the early 1980s and now belongs to the city.
   ``This is the most significant landmark in town,'' said Gary
Breschini, an archaeologist. He said preservationists are willing
to allow most of the hotel to be razed if the original part, the
Abbott, is restored. They estimate the cost at $500,000.
   Officials, however, said it would cost about $3.5 million, money
that should go to projects more vital to the growing city.
   A redevelopment plan calls for replacing the hotel with a
parking lot, an office building and a Steinbeck museum behind a
facade depicting the original hotel.
   The city's decision stirred memories of a brillant writer who
became hated by his own neighbors because of his defense of migrant
farm workers.
   ``Steinbeck was not liked in this town,'' said Brusa, president
of the Monterey County Historical Society. ``They did not
understand him. They burned `The Grapes of Wrath' here.''
   This year is the 50th anniversary of the ``The Grapes of
Wrath,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel that was once banned in
the Salinas library.

   A jumbo jet and a commuter plane flew about 100
feet apart as they approached Kennedy International Airport, and 45
minutes later a jetliner reported coming within 400 yards of a
private plane.
   No injuries were reported in either incident Sunday, and Federal
Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said they were
``totally unrelated and happened miles and miles apart.''
   Also Sunday, a Piedmont Airlines jet was evacuated at
Fayetteville, N.C., Regional Airport when the crew noticed smoke
inside the plane. Two of its 76 passengers were injured during the
evacuation, officials said.
   The first near miss involved a small turboprop commuter plane
and a Boeing 747, Bergen said.
   TWA Flight 701 from London was flying at 1,900 feet about five
miles southeast of Kennedy when the pilot reported that a Pocono
airline plane had passed about 100 feet above and to the right,
Bergen said.
   Both planes were being monitored by air traffic controllers and
preparing to land at Kennedy, she said.
   The Pocono pilot had been instructed to land after the TWA
plane, which was scheduled behind an Air France jetliner, she said.
The Air France jet had just landed when the Pocono plane flew by
the TWA jet, Bergen said.
   Bergen said the TWA pilot did not take evasive action. The
Pocono Merlin SW-4 was ordered to abort its landing so the TWA
flight could land first.
   Bergen did not know where Pocono Flight 7636 originated, and
there was no answer Sunday night at the airline's New York office.
   The other near miss occurred near Westchester County Airport and
involved a Pan Am jet flying LaGuardia Airport to Boston and a
small Cessna plane, Bergen said.
   The Pan Am Boeing 727 had been cleared by air controllers to
climb to 17,000 feet and had just passed 10,000 feet when the
captain reported that the Cessna was 400 yards away and had a
vertical separation of 200 feet, said Bergen.
   The Pan Am plane turned and climbed in the opposite direction to
avoid the Cessna 414, Bergen said.
   She said the captain's reports will be studied along with tapes
and other materials to determine who erred. She said officials have
the Cessna's registration number and have determined the plane was
headed for Bedford, Pa. It was not under the direction of the
traffic controllers.
   Bergen said she did not know how many people were aboard the
planes in the two incidents.
   In Fayetteville, the Piedmont jetliner left the terminal, then
made an abrupt stop, a passenger said. Dave Shipley, spokesman for
USAir Group Inc., which owns Piedmont, said a crew member informed
the pilot of smoke in the passenger compartment.
   Shipley said the smoke came from smoldering loose oil in the
plane's duct system near an auxiliary power unit mounted in the
tail section. Heat from the unit may have caused the oil to
smolder, he said.
   ``There was no fire, but there was some smoke coming out of
it,'' Shipley said. ``The smoke intensified enough that he felt it
was prudent to stop the airplane and disembark the passengers down
the evacuation chute.''
   The Boeing 727-200 was headed to Pittsburgh.
   One passenger suffered broken bones in his back and another
complained of chest pains and lower back pains, said relatives and
officials.
   Shipley said three chutes were used and that one of them was
deflated after it was punctured by a sharp object carried by a
passenger.

<HEAD>Rare 1931 Bugatti Classic Auto Auctioned For $11 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rare 1931 Bugatti Type-41 Royale received a
record $11 million bid at an international classic car auction.
   The bid was made by Ed Weaver, a carpet mill owner from Dalton,
Ga. During the six-minute, 20-second auction, Weaver outbid three
other bidders, including author Clyve Cussler of Denver and
Domino's Pizza of Detroit.
   But owner Hans Thulin of Stockholm wants $15 million for the
Bugatti, one of only six in existence, and continued negotiations
with Weaver late Sunday.
   A determination on whether the vehicle will be sold was expected
today.
   Bidding at the Landmark Hotel and Casino opened at $2 million,
jumped to $5 million and began proceeding in $1 million increments
within the first minute of bidding.
   The previous auction price record for an automobile was $9.87
million set in 1987 in London by Thulin on the same Italian
vehicle, officials said.
   A total of 546 cars were auctioned at this two-day event known
as The Auction, bringing total bids of between $45 million and $50
million, according to co-organizers Richie Clyne and Don Williams.
   Thirty-four vehicles went for at least $100,000 each at the
third-annual auction, including a 1932 Duesenberg Murphy SJ, which
sold for $1.15 million.
   The event attracted 2,000 bidders from 14 countries, according
to Clyne.

   The ashes of former Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang are to be buried in a remote southern China forest planted
by members of the Communist Youth League he once headed, a
newspaper reported today.
   The party's official People's Daily said Hu's widow Li Zhao
requested that the ashes be buried on the Gongqing (Communist
Youth) reclamation farm in Jiangxi province.
   Gongqing farm was started in 1955 by 98 Shanghai youth under the
guidance of Hu, then secretary of the Communist Youth League.
   Hu died of a heart attack on April 15 at age 73. He was cremated
on Saturday following a state funeral in the Great Hall of the
People attended by 4,000 of China's top leaders.
   The death of the reformist leader has sparked weeklong student
demonstrations for democratic reforms. Today, students at major
Beijing universities began an indefinite class boycott to press
their demands for free speech and an end to government corruption.
   Hu was ousted as party general secretary in January 1987 after
being accused of being soft on student demonstrations and Western
liberal trends.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stock Prices Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged down against the Japanese yen
today and stock prices fell in the lightest trading so far this
year amid concerns about a possible interest rate increase and an
intensifying political scandal.
   The dollar closed at 131.38 yen, down from its close of 131.45
yen on Friday. It opened at 131.37 yen and ranged between 131.20
and 131.45 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues dropped 223.89 points, or 0.68 percent, closing at
33,805.92 points.
   Volume was exceptionally light at about 450 million shares. The
market fell 155.34 points on Friday.
   Concern about the Recruit stock-profiteering and bribery scandal
shaking Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita's government, a possible
discount rate increase by the Bank of Japan and hesitancy before a
weeklong holiday next week dampened the foreign exchange and stock
markets, dealers said.
   ``It was a broad decline,'' said Christopher Taylor, head of
equity sales at Baring Securities Japan Ltd.
   ``Institutional investors are really worried the Nikkei Dow
might plunge even if the discount rate is raised just 0.5
percent,'' although rumors were rife that it would be raised as
much as 1 percent, said a salesman at a foreign securities house
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said that because of Golden Week, the coming holiday,
``institutional investors are trying to wait to see what everyone
else is doing.''
   Speculation about a possible discount rate increase later this
week also helped dampen currency trading, traders said.
   ``Some people expect the Bank of Japan will move to hike the
discount rate after the consumer price index is announed this
week,'' said Ichiro Ikeda, head of the international corporate desk
in the foreign exchange section of Chemical Bank. He said he
remained skeptical of the rumor.
   The rate is what the central bank charges for loans to
commercial banks, and in turn influences their interest rates.
   ``The market is very uncertain and very quiet,'' said Norio
Takeda, senior manager of foreign exchange at the Bank of Tokyo. He
noted that traders also were waiting for an expected announcement
sometime this week by the West German government about a tax change.
   West Germany's withholding tax, which went into effect Jan. 1,
has prompted large capital outflows and a weaker mark since it was
announced last year.

   Iran and Iraq made no progress in their latest
round of peace talks but remain committed to the cease-fire that
halted their eight-year war, says U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar.
   The U.N. chief, who chaired the four days of talks between the
countries' foreign ministers that ended Sunday, said he might seek
a fifth round of talks in June.
   ``We have clarified positions again, but what I call progress
has not been obtained,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   He said both sides reassured him of their commitment ``to the
upholding of the cease-fire and the pursuit of the process.''
   The talks have been stalled since the first round began on Aug.
25, five days after the U.N.-supervised truce halted hostilities.
   Iran and Iraq said they are ready for more talks but accused
each other of instransigence on resolving issues.
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said Iraq had
refused a proposed 15-day period for withdrawing its troops from
Iranian soil. Velayati had demanded that Perez de Cuellar set such
a timetable.
   The United Nations says that about 260 square miles of Iranian
territory remain under Iraqi control. Tehran says the area is three
times as large.
   Velayati said Iraq's foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, also
continued to reject U.N. proposals for repatriation of prisoners
and clearing the Shatt-al-Arab waterway, Iraq's only sea outlet, of
silt and war debris.
   Aziz said Iran ``refrained from the correct manner of conducting
negotiations'' but did not mention specific issues.

<HEAD>Black Minister Resigns Rather Than Dismiss ``Mississippi Burning''
Sheriff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MERIDIAN, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black minister stepped down after
church members' relentless attacks for his hiring of a white former
sheriff acquitted in the slaying of three civil rights workers 25
years ago.
   For his last sermon at Golden Grove Missionary Baptist Church in
Meehan, the Rev. Evan E. McDonald chose the topics of God's love
and forgiveness _ qualities he said he showed in hiring former
Neshoba County Sheriff Lawrence Rainey as a guard in his Meridian
security service.
   The killings were depicted in the movie ``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``For 17 years, I didn't have any kind of problem with that
church and _ boom!'' McDonald said before Sunday's service. ``Some
of the people real close to me said as long as that man was working
for me there would be no peace in that church. I told them I'd
leave for peace sake. ...
   ``We teach love. We teach forgiveness. Here are people who
profess to be Christians and they behave like heathens,'' McDonald
said, adding that he had received threatening telephone calls and
his security business is ``not flourishing like it should.''
   Hervy Spinks, chairman of the church's deacons, declined to
comment.
   ``That's between him and God,'' he said of McDonald's
resignation.
   Rainey was among 18 men indicted by a federal grand jury after
the 1964 slayings of 21-year-old James Chaney, who was black, and
20-year-old Andrew Goodman and 24-year-old Michael Schwerner, who
were white. He was acquitted in 1967 of violating their civil
rights by depriving them of life.
   The controversy in the small church surfaced after People
magazine published an article Jan. 9 about Rainey, noting the irony
of his working for a black. The article preceded the release of
``Mississippi Burning.''
   McDonald blames the movie for stirring up racial hostilities. He
said much of the contention has been directed toward him and his
McDonald's Security Service.
   Rainey offred to leave rather than cause problems for his boss.
   ``I really hate it for him,'' Rainey said. ``I offered to quit
or have him lay me off. He said, `No! No!'
   ``I think it will finally blow over if they ever quit playing
this movie in Meridian.''
   The Rev. Wardell Tanksley of Collinsville said the movie can't
be blamed for McDonald losing his church.
   ``I love him, but he made a mistake,'' Tanksley said. ``I'm not
saying he should fire him. All of us have to work. Evan should have
used better action. He should never have hired him.
   ``He (Rainey) was associated with something that's a smear on
Mississippi, a scar on the pages of history,'' Tanksley said.
   If his goal was to be more Christian, McDonald should have tried
to get Rainey to give speeches at black churches to defuse the
racial tension, said Tanksley, pastor of St. Paul Missionary
Baptist Church in Philadelphia.

<HEAD>Youth In Central Park Attack Said It Was `Fun'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight teen-agers charged in the beating and rape
of a Central Park jogger have shown no remorse, and one called it
``fun'' in a confession, police said.
   Seven of the youths, ages 14 to 17, made videotaped statements
to police; the eighth gave a written statement, said Gerald
McKelvey, a spokesman for the district attorney's office.
   After hearing about the statements at their arraignment,
Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Charles Solomon ordered all eight
held without bail on charges of second-degree attempted murder,
first-degree rape and first-degree assault.
   The victim, a 28-year-old Wall Street investment banker whose
skull was fractured Wednesday by a pipe and a brick, remained in a
coma Sunday, said Richard Conte, an administrator at Metropolitan
Hospital.
   The attack came while the pack of youths was ``wilding'' in the
park _ their term for a rampage of random violence and thievery,
police said. The woman was attacked by at least 12 youths who were
hiding in the underbrush by a road in a northern section of Central
Park when she jogged alone after dark.
   Police said the group knocked her down with the metal pipe and
gagged her with her clothing. While some held her down and fondled
her, at least four raped her.
   The eight youths have shown no remorse, sang a rap song about
sex, ``Wild Thing,'' whistled at policewomen and laughed when
comparing what they had told detectives, according to published
reports.
   ``It was fun,'' one of the suspects, 15-year-old Yusef Salaam,
said in a written confession, according to McKelvey.
   All of the suspects are being tried as adults, but only two,
ages 16 and 17, could be sentenced as adults.
   Detectives investigating that attack believe that some of the
youths may have participated in a similar attack four days earlier.
   A roving gang of youths terrorized an East Harlem area on April
15 using tactics similar to those used Wednesday, The New York
Times reported today.

   Tens of thousands of students at Beijing's
universities went on strike today, calling for democracy, human
rights and a free press in the largest student boycott in Communist
China's history.
   At Beijing University, the country's most prestigious, students
for the first time produced an independent newspaper.
   The class boycott today brought into a new phase pro-democracy
protests that were sparked by the April 15 death of ousted
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a popular reformer.
   Posters calling on students to strike, satirical cartoons of
government leaders, and essays decrying official corruption covered
the walls of many universities throughout Beijing.
   Student leaders said they planned to strike until the government
agrees to opens talks and that they believed students in other
cities were ready to join the boycott.
   ``Premier Li Peng, step down now,'' read one poster at Beijing
Normal University. ``Deng Xiaoping, your time has come,'' read
another in a reference to widespread student belief that the
84-year-old senior leader is too old to run the country.
   On Friday and Saturday, about 150,000 students and supporters
spent the night at Tiananmen Square, defying a government order to
clear the vast expanse. The demonstration _ one of the biggest
since the 1949 Communist victory _ was the students' clearest
challenge yet to the ruling monopoly.
   Students who gathered Saturday on the square to mourn Hu shouted
``Down with dictatorship'' as senior officials arrived for an
official memorial service at the adjacent Great Hall of the People.
   Protests also occurred in other cities. In Xian and Changsha,
bands of young toughs entered student ranks, burning cars and
buildings, looting stores and beating policemen. Foreign sources in
Changsha said the looting continued there for a second night
Sunday, but on a smaller scale.
   Smaller protests in Shanghai, Chengdu, Canton and Tianjin were
peaceful.
   At Beijing University today, about 5,000 students, one-third of
the student body, flocked to the athletic field for a meeting of
the newly formed student union.
   ``We come here together for a common purpose: democracy and
science,'' a student leader told the crowd. ``Seventy years after
our first student movement, China is still poor and behind the rest
of the world.''
   About 1,500 students gathered at Qinghua University, where
graduate students draped pro-democracy posters from every balcony
and window.
   About 1,000 students from the Beijing Foreign Languages College
left their campus and marched from school to school to encourage
colleagues.
   One strike leader at Beijing University said all 15,000 students
were on strike. Leaders at several other schools, with a combined
enrollment of 20,000, said their classmates also were boycotting
class.
   At Beijing Normal University students marched through the campus
banging drums and gongs and yelling in unison: ``Boycott class,
boycott class.'' Several groups entered buildings, occupying
classrooms.
   One poster at Beijing University pleaded with teachers to
``please understand and support our strike. I love my teachers but
I love the truth more.'' Another addressed China's parliament,
appealing for government tolerance. It was signed by 143 teachers.
   The first issue of the student-run newspaper provided a detailed
account of what the students said were police beatings last week.
Previously, students were not allowed to print their own papers.
   Copies were plastered on trees, utility poles, in bathrooms and
on walls throughout the campus.
   The students have also presented to the state a list of demands
including freedom of the press, a crackdown on rampant corruption
and the publication of financial records of China's leaders.
   ``If we act boldly, we will become the heroes of China. If we
lose our nerve, we will have the guilt of history on our
shoulders,'' said Wu'er Kaixi, a student leader at Beijing Normal
University.
   He said the main goal of the movement right now was to expand
the strike to other cities: ``The government is still ignoring us.
Our only hope is to make this movement nationwide.''
   Outside the campus, students set out collection boxes and handed
out leaflets. At one corner near the school, students said they had
received more than 2,000 yuan ($540) in two hours.
   Other groups made speeches at major intersections, stopping
traffic at some points. ``Workers, listen to us,'' one student told
a crowd of 500 in central Beijing. ``We are fighting for the rights
of all Chinese.''
   At a meeting Sunday night, students decided on a slogan for the
movement: Democracy, Science, Freedom, Human Rights and Law.
   The catchphrase is based on China's greatest democratic
movement, the May 4th movement of 1919, which celebrates its 70th
anniversary a week from Thursday. Students say they expect the
strike to continue at least until then.
   The protests occur as China faces serious economic problems such
as record-high inflation and ingrained corruption in the Communist
Party.
   A recent meeting of the national legislature ended by braking
further an ambitious reform program started in 1979 to open China's
state-run economy to market forces. Students say they oppose the
retrenchment.

   A North American record lottery prize
sent gamblers and non-gamblers to lines to buy a one in 9.6 million
chance at winning at least $70 million.
   Across Pennsylvania, Super 7 Lottery tickets sold at a rate of
750,000 an hour this weekend.
   ``I wouldn't be an American if I didn't play,'' said Colleen
Marchiano, 34, who bought $10 worth of tickets at Beavers
Restaurant in Great Bend.
   Among those in line was Howard Hurst, 66, who drove three hours
from East Greenbush, N.Y. Did he come to buy a lottery ticket?
``No, I came for a hamburger,'' he said, shaking his head at the
question.
   What did he plan to do if he won? ``Spend it on lottery
tickets,'' he said, drawing laughs from those in line near him.
   Participants select seven numbers out of 80. The player wins if
those seven numbers are among the 11 that will be drawn Wednesday
night.
   The jackpot will be larger than the record-breaking $69.9
million won by four Illinois ticket-holders April 15. The largest
single U.S. lottery payout was $55.16 million won by a Florida
woman in September in that state's lotto game.
   ``It's a chance to buy a very large, life-changing prize with a
very small amount of money,'' said Pennsylvania Lottery Executive
Director James Scroggins.
   But a psychologist warned Sunday that many players are in for
depression when reality catches up with their dreams.
   ``This lottery fantasy syndrome really heats up when the lotto
jackpot climbs over $50 million,'' said Robert R. Butterworth, a
researcher at Contemporary Psychology Associates Inc. in Los
Angeles. ``People purchase a ticket, ignore the odds and start
thinking of the impossible.''
   At Beavers, however, the restaurant called in a police officer
to help control the line that totaled up to 500 at a time.
   ``They're out there freezing,'' Gary Conklin, the restaurant
manager, said of the crowd Saturday. ``As the line goes down, 30
more people replace them.''
   ``I've never seen anything like it since I've been around here,
and I've been here all my life,'' said Victor Welch, 60, a
patrolman with the Hallstead-Great Bend-New Milford Municipal
Police Department.
   ``It's exciting just to see them come in here,'' said Carlene
Haggerty, 40, a waitress at Beavers. ``They all have a dream.
Everybody has a dream.''
   Ms. Haggerty has a dream, too. She'd move to Nashville and try
to sell some of the country and western songs she's written.
   Like everyone else, she knew her chances were slim. But she's
written a poem that hangs on the wall of the restaurant.
   It begins: ``Lottery sold here says the sign on the door. If you
have a dream come in and find out more.'' It ends: ``Change your
life my friend if you care to spend a dollar. Where else can you
buy a dream for a dollar?''

   Ninety-one barges broke loose from a

Sunshine Bridge, forcing its closure for more than two hours.
   No one was hurt and nothing leaked from the barges, officials
said.
   Dempsey Edmonston, dock supervisor for Burnside Terminal, said
the barges were moored two miles upriver from the bridge when they
got loose Sunday.
   All were rounded up and secured within a couple hours, the Coast
Guard said.
   There were unconfirmed reports that the wake from a passing ship
tore the barge loose.

<HEAD>Resignation Of Union Boss Could Speed Strike Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CANDICE HUGHES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The resignation of the leader of the
country's powerful teachers' union could help end a week-old
strike, but the striking teachers are still demanding higher wages,
their leaders say.
   In a two-paragraph statement issued Sunday, the Presidential
Palace said Carlos Jonguitud Barrios told President Carlos Salinas
de Gortari he was stepping down as head of the National Education
Worker's Union.
   Teachers had accused him of corruption and called for his ouster.
   The strike was called by the National Coordinate, a dissident
faction in the union that accuses union leaders of political
patronage, corruption and of neglecting the rank-and-file.
   The union, with a membership of more than 1 million, is among
the largest and most powerful in Latin America. The National
Coordinate claims about half the membership.
   The government news agency Notimex on Sunday quoted dissident
teachers as saying that Jonguitud's resignation should help
negotiations but that they would not give up their demands for a
100 percent salary increase and union reforms such as free
elections. Teachers now earn about $142 a month.
   The strike talks were to resume today after a weekend recess.
   The strikers also said they planned a mass march to Zocalo,
Mexico City's huge central plaza. A similar demonstration last week
rallied tens of thousands of people to the downtown plaza.
   Dissident teachers nationwide walked off the job one week ago,
shutting down thousands of schools and focusing national attention
on the union's internal battles.
   Previous administrations tried to ignore the dissident movement,
which has been growing for a decade.
   The Salinas administration reacted to the strike by organizing
talks between the union and its dissident wing and by offering a 10
percent salary increase.
   Jonguitud was closely allied to the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party and had been rewarded with a relatively free

   The African American Summit '89 can't be
judged by its lower-than-expected attendance, says the chairman of
the three-day gathering of black leaders over the weekend.
   ``The real test will be whether there are some things that come
out of here that have a relationship and meaning for the lives of
millions of people in this country who right now are in crisis,''
said Richard Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Ind.
   Summit participants issued a call for greater government action
on education, housing, black employment and drugs, among other
things.
   Jesse Jackson's Saturday speech and Louis Farrakhan's fiery
Sunday morning address drew the conference's largest and most
enthusiastic crowds, estimated at 1,000 at the New Orleans
Convention Center.
   But only a week before, organizers predicted a crowd of at least
2,000. And 17 years earlier, 2,700 came to a similar meeting
Hatcher organized in Gary.
   Delegates, however, expressed little disappointment at the
turnout.
   ``The significant thing is that we came together,'' said Sheldon
King, a delegate from Chicago.
   The summit's invitation to Farrakhan, a controversial Black
Muslim minister, prompted at least one black Republican leader,
Fred Brown of New York, to boycott the conference.
   Conservative blacks who boycotted because of Farrakhan lost a
chance to have their voices heard, said King.
   The meeting ended Sunday with distribution and discussion of the
summit's social and political agenda for the next decade.
   Several delegates complained during the closing session that the
seven-page document failed to address all problems with specific
solutions. But Hatcher stressed that the agenda was far from
finished and that the summit steering committee would continue to
work on it.
   The preliminary agenda included calls for:
   _ Preservation of black family life.
   _ More government involvement in providing housing for the poor,
including a reduction in ``red tape'' in making federally
foreclosed housing available for private ownership by the poor.
   _ A call for increased government spending on education and ``a
halt to the rush to implement testing, certification schemes and
other devices designed to basically eliminate black teachers from
the public school systems.''
   _ Support for government and private programs designed to
increase black employment and business investment opportunities.
   _ Work to end apartheid in South Africa, including support for
economic sanctions against that nation.
   _ Reparations to compensate blacks for hundreds of years of
slave labor and poor economic conditions. What form such
reparations should take was not specified.
   _ A full-scale attack on drugs that ``should not begin and end
at the borders of the African American communities.''

   A 15-year-old girl escaped from abductors who
held her captive for six days and raped her repeatedly, then she
was raped again by a man who picked her up as she pleaded for help,
police said.
   Two city park rangers discovered the teen-ager at early Saturday
in Rose Hill Park after she had been raped by a man whom she had
asked for help, said Lt. Sergio Robleto.
   ``The allegations that this young lady has made are probably
some of the more heinous allegations that I've heard in quite some
time,'' said Robleto.
   The attack in the park followed a horrifying week that began
April 16 while the girl was shopping at the Greyhound Bus Terminal
during a stopover on a trip home from a friend's house in Corona,
said Robleto.
   Corona is 45 miles east of Los Angeles and she was returning to
her home in Thousand Oaks, 40 miles northwest of downtown Los
Angeles.
   Two men holding knives approached the girl, forced her into a
car carrying at least three other men, and drove her to a house in
the south-central area, Robleto said.
   Over six days the girl was held prisoner while at least two men
_ and possibly more _ raped her several times, the lieutenant said.
   Late Friday, the girl convinced one of her captives to let her
go, Robleto said. Outside, she quickly flagged down a gold 1976
Buick Regal carrying three men, asking them to take her to police.
   Instead, she was driven to Rose Hill Park and allegedly raped
before two park rangers arrived, Robleto said.
   ``That's the only good thing in this whole terrible story,''
Robleto said. ``The chances of those rangers being at that place at
the time were a thousand to one.''
   An 18-year-old Los Angeles man was arrested for investigation of
sexual assault, and his two companions were held for questioning,
said Robleto.
   The girl was examined at White Memorial Hospital and released to
her parents, who had reported her missing, he said.

<TEXT>
   About 1.5 million workers across the
nation staged a one-day strike today for higher wages, shutting
down down factories in Dhaka, news reports said.
   United News of Bangladesh said bus drivers and other employees
of the country's public transportation system did not show up for
work and that many car owners stayed off the roads for fear of
violence.
   An umbrella group of more than 20 trade unions sponsored by the
country's leading opposition parties called the strike.
   The workers demanded that their monthly wages be increased from
about $25 a month to $44. They also sought a cost-of-living
allowance equal to 60 percent of their salaries to compensate for
inflation since their last raises four years ago.
   The workers have rejected a government offer of a 10 percent
cost-of-living allowance that was scheduled to begin in July.
   The government puts the inflation rate at 14 percent, but many
economists believe it rose past 20 percent late last year.
   Nirmal Sen, a spokesman for the unions, said the strike included
factory workers, transportation employees and shop workers.
   He said the strike was successful in industrial areas outside
Dhaka, but there was no independent confirmation.
   Police were stationed in front of government offices to guard
against violence. Some groups of workers marched through the
capital's commercial district, but there were no confrontations
with police, witnesses said.

   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat will make his first
official visit to France next month, meeting with President
Francois Mitterrand and other government officials on May 2,
Mitterrand's spokesman announced today.
   The spokesman, Hubert Vedrine, did not provide other details and
did not say whether Arafat's visit would last more than one day.
   The principle _ although not the date _ of an official visit had
been announced two weeks ago, leading to criticism from Israel and
French Jews who contend the PLO remains committed to Israel's
destruction.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, interviewed Sunday on French
television, said France remains ``a close friend of Israel.''
   But Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel later said that he
sees the planned visit ``with gravity.''
   ``President Mitterrand presents himself as a friend of Israel,
but what he does today totally opposes any friendly treatment of
Israel,'' Shamir said in an interview with Israel army radio.
   Dumas said France takes into account Israel's concerns, but also
what he called ``the reality of the Palestinian people.''
   He said the actions of the Palestine National Council last
November in Algiers and statements by Arafat in Geneva accepting
the right of Israel to exist and renouncing terrorism made the
visit possible.
   Dumas noted that Arafat already has made official visits to
Greece, Spain and Italy and has been received by Pope John Paul II.
   Dumas and other French foreign ministers have met with Arafat on
several occasions, but never before in Paris.
   After Arafat's statements in Geneva, the United States dropped
its ban on all contacts with the PLO.
   Since then representatives of the group in Tunis, Tunisia, where
the PLO is headquartered, have met several times with U.S.
Ambassador Robert Pelletreau.

   Wayne State University ended a 12-day student
takeover at an administration building by promising to nearly
triple the amount spent on black studies and hire more black
professors.
   Forty to 50 protesters, the last of up to 100 who had occupied
the student services center since April 12, left the building
Sunday.
   ``I'm happy, but I also know that what was done here is not
necessarily the end of what must be done to correct injustices to
members of my race,'' said Walter Boykin, a sophomore from Detroit.
   The university granted the students amnesty for the takeover and
allowed them to complete missed course work, said Wayne State
spokesman Vern Foss.
   Dalmas Taylor, dean of liberal arts and the school's chief
negotiator during the protest, said the students accomplished most
of what they set out to do.
   ``The students presented the university with a list of 17
proposals. Among them was some that brought our attention to
serious needs,'' Taylor said. ``Some of them we were aware of.''
   Students agreed to drop a demand that black studies courses be
taught only by blacks, a requirement officials said would be
illegal.
   The student services building houses offices that handle
financial aid, registration and records. It was closed during the
takeover but not damaged.
   Blacks make up 27 percent of Wayne State's 30,000 students.
   The university agreed to create 10 new full-time scholarships
for blacks and increase the number of black faculty members from 99
to 113 within three years.
   That would raise the percentage of blacks on the faculty to 8.7
percent, which officials said was three times the national average
for universities.
   The university also agreed to elevate the school's Center for
Black Studies to a full department and budget $452,500 for the
1989-90 school year. The Center for Black Studies received $163,000
in 1988-89.
   ``I believe we accomplished a lot,'' said Eric Dulan, a freshman
from Detroit. ``We broadened the department of black studies, which
we needed to do. The classes are so full, sometimes you have to go
in and stand up.''
   ``We showed them we were serious, and we remain serious.''

<HEAD>Alaska-Siberia Eskimo Protocol Signed Despite Poor Weather</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Blowing snow forced Alaska and Soviet
officials to meet over the telephone instead of on the Bering Sea
ice for a symbolic gesture aimed at easing travel restrictions on
U.S. and Soviet Eskimos.
   Gov. Steve Cowper and his counterpart from the Magadan region of
the Soviet Far East, Vyacheslav I. Kobets, signed a protocol Sunday
urging Soviet and U.S. officials to allow regular visits between
Eskimos in the two countries.
   Cowper and Kobets had planned to sign the document on the
international dateline, but bad weather grounded the mayor in Nome.
   He used a telephone to communicate with Kobets, whose delegation
made it by helicopter to Little Diomede Island on the U.S. side of
the dateline. Little Diomede is 2{ miles from Big Diomede Island on
the Soviet side.
   About 40 people jammed into a small office of a telephone
company switching station to watch Cowper sign the protocol. Cowper
and Kobets, who had been sent a copy of the document earlier,
talked through translators.
   The protocol calls for a border commission to oversee travel
between the two countries. Eskimos would not be required to obtain
visas, only to check in with the commission before traveling.
   Eskimos from Alaska and Siberia routinely visited each other
under a 1938 agreement, but the so-called Bering Bridge was closed
at the onset of the Cold War 10 years later.
   ``Even though this is perhaps not the best way to make this
agreement, it is a very significant step, we think,'' said Cowper,
apologizing for the weather. ``We believe it is a great and
important event.''
   Cowper said that he is uncertain when U.S. and Soviet diplomats
might complete their negotiations on the matter but that it could
be by summer.
   The signing was to have taken place at the site of the dateline
crossing Sunday by a U.S.-Soviet team of adventurers on a 60-day
trek aimed at calling attention to the common cultural heritage of
Bering natives.
   The group of six Soviets and six Americans is using skis,
dogsleds and Eskimo ``skin boats'' to travel 1,200 miles through
the Soviet Far East and Alaska. The expedition began in mid-March
in the Siberian city of Anadyr.
   Cowper told Kobets he would like to visit the Magadan region in
September, and asked, ``Should I bring my fishing rod?''
   ``You can bring your own, but we'll give you one,'' replied
Kobets, suggesting they swap poles.
   ``That is what we would call a deal,'' Cowper said.
   ``It's what we call a good deal,'' Kobets responded.

   Being born in a VW Beetle may be a bizarre
way to begin life, but it doesn't bug Volkswagen of America, which
hands out $300 savings bonds instead of cigars.
   The automaker has cited 403 infants since it launched its
``Bonds for Babies Born in Volkswagens'' program in 1964, VW
publicist Tom McDonald said.
   Only 10 babies have been inducted into the club in the past five
years, McDonald said. Children believed to have been conceived in
VWs don't qualify.
   VW births haven't been limited to humans, McDonald said. One
Beetle owner wrote that his Great Dane bore a litter in the back
seat of the Bug.
   The canine received a case of dog food instead of a bond,
McDonald said.

   The Communist Party chief of the Soviet
republic of Georgia acknowledged today that some victims of a clash
between protesters and soldiers died of gas poisoning.
   In Moscow, troops on Sunday dragged away dozens of demonstrators
protesting the violent crackdown on dissent in Georgia two weeks
ago. The official Tass news agency said 47 demonstrators were
arrested.
   Givi Gumbaridze, chief of the Georgian Communist Party,
acknowledged widespread reports today that soldiers used a harmful
gas to crush pro-independence demonstrations in Tbilisi.
   ``The fact that gases were used is the truth. Yes, some people
died from poisoning,'' he told reporters taken to the southern
republic by the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
   His remark was the first by a top official acknowledging that
some protesters were killed by gas used April 9 to help break up a
crowd of thousands of demonstrators in Tbilisi, the Georgian
capital.
   At least 19 people were killed as soldiers using clubs, shovels
and gas dispersed the demonstrators, and official accounts said one
man was shot later. Georgian activists previously had charged that
gas killed some protesters.
   The Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda on Saturday
identified a chemical used against the protesters as an
incapacitating agent dubbed ``cheremukha.''
   Its main ingredient is chloroacetophenone, the newspaper said. A
Western military attache in Moscow said the substance was similar
to but stronger than tear gas.
   Gumbaridze said officials were trying to determine who ordered
the use of the chemical. He did not say how many people died from
its effects.
   Members of a citizens' commission formed by the government to
investigate the attack said a second gas was used as well.
Officials have not identified it.
   Symptoms of poisoning by the second gas include vomiting, memory
loss, headache and nausea, said Nino Djavakhisheili, a morphologist
and member of the 40-member commission. He said the symptoms are
permanent.
   Malkahz Zaalisheili, a molecular biologist and member of the
commission, said light concentrations of the first chemical
substance act like tear gas, but ``in bigger concentrations it
becomes very poisonous.''
   ``Another substance was used that paralyzes central nervous
systems. The structure of the second gas they refuse to tell us,''
he said.
   The citizens commission said 700 people were injured in the
demonstrations.
   Gumbaridze, former KGB head for the republic, replaced Dzhumber
Patiashvili as Georgian party chief. Patiashvili resigned after
accepting responsibility for the violence.
   The 44-year-old Gumbaridze said the decision to send soldiers to
break up the demonstration was made by a few Georgian leaders and
that he did not know about it until moments before it occurred.
   ``This was a very serious mistake,'' he said. ``Not everyone
participated in this decision. The law should be enforced but this
law should be enforced without victims.''
   Protests began in Tbilisi on April 4 against a call by some
ethnic Abkhazians, a minority in Georgia, to be separated from the
republic. Protests grew and many of the demonstrators began
demanding full independence for Georgia.
   Soldiers were called and 19 people died in the melee on
Tbilisi's main avenue. One young man was shot and killed for
violating a curfew that was imposed.
   Demonstrators arrested in Sunday's protest in Moscow were to
appear in court today could be fined or sentenced to jail for 10-15
days, said Yuri Mityunov, spokesman for the independent Democratic
Union, which organized the protest.
   Thousands of protesters in Moscow gathered in the Sunday
afternoon drizzle and some raised white, blue and red banners, the
flag of czarist Russia, before marching about a mile to the
Georgian cultural center.
   The demonstrators pushed past police barricades, spilling onto
Pushkin Square and across Tverskoy Boulevard.
   Police stood by in lines while a special Interior Ministry unit
waded into the crowd, singling out protesters and dragging them to
waiting buses.
   Moscow authorities had banned the protest and warned it would
not be tolerated. They accused the Democratic Union of trying to
stir up tension.

   A mob of jobless workers hunting for a
man who shut down two textile mills mistakenly chased six Soviet
diplomats and smashed their cars, police said today.
   The laid-off jute workers, led by Marxist trade unionists,
attacked a house where the Soviet envoys were attending a picnic.
   ``We are Russian Communists. Don't attack us,'' police quoted
the diplomats as saying when about 200 men armed with machetes,
homemade bombs and bamboo canes on Sunday raided the house in the
village of Dogacha, about 25 miles from Calcutta.
   They said none of the Soviets, who work at the Calcutta
consulate and included deputy trade commissioner A.V. Donocian, was
injured but their cars were smashed.
   A jute trader, Nabin Sur, had invited the Soviets to a picnic at
his father's house, police said.
   The mob was looking for the owner of two jute mills that were
shut down a year ago and mistakenly thought he was attending the
picnic, according to police, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``We want his head,'' the angry men chanted. The Soviets ran out
of the house pursued by the crowd but managed to find shelter in
nearby houses, the police said.
   The mob dispersed after Sur's father fired a gun in the air and
police arrived.
   Narayanan Krishnamurthy, chief secretary of Marxist-governed
West Bengal state, said six people, including a Marxist labor
leader, had been arrested.

<TEXT>
   The real George Washington surely didn't have to
answer questions about Star Wars, baseball and bad teeth the way
his stand-in did at ceremonies marking the 200th anniversary of the
first president's inauguration.
   As history buffs and tourists looked on, Washington's arrival in
New York was re-enacted Sunday at South Street Seaport, several
blocks from where the real Washington arrived for festivities
preceding his swearing-in on April 30, 1789.
   William Sommerfield of Philadelphia, an expert on the nation's
first president, stepped off a boat in a tri-corner hat and cape,
amid skyscrapers and the roar of traffic that he made a point of
ignoring.
   The ceremony kicked off a week of events marking the
bicentennial.
   ``A bold new experiment in government was launched on that day
in this great city,'' Mayor Edward I. Koch said. He welcomed
``George Washington, reincarnated, back to New York City.''
   Two centuries ago, the real Washington alighted from a barge via
carpeted steps as church bells pealed and cannons blasted.
Eschewing a fancy coach, he strolled up narrow Wall Street, bowing
and tipping his hat to cheering admirers who leaned out of windows
and looked down from rooftops.
   On Sunday, many in the crowd applauded as the mock Washington
walked by, and some asked the white-haired gentleman for an
autograph. But not 72-year-old Monte Schreck, who wanted to know
where Washington would take his wife.
   ``Are you going to take her to Shea Stadium for a Mets game?''
Schreck asked.
   ``I'm sorry sir, I am not familiar with your term. Is that a
political party, sir?'' asked Sommerfield.
   Later, someone asked, ``How do you feel about Star Wars?''
   ``Are you from another country, sir? I'm only a poor Virginia
farmer. You have to speak my language,'' Sommerfield said.
   When one impertinent reporter asked, ``How are your teeth at
this point?'', Sommerfield took the opportunity to remind listeners
that the old tale of George's wooden teeth was ``a fallacy. ...
They are made of bone and ivory.''
   With that a mock presidential aide stepped in and said,
``Gentleman, that's a rather personal question for the president.''
   A few people tested Sommerfield on controversial issues.
   ``What about slavery? Are you against slavery?'' a man shouted.
   ``I am totally against the trading of human species,''
Sommerfield said. ``And during my terms in office I will work
toward the elimination of slavery under the law.''
   The most difficult question may have had to do with the
president's seemingly poor eyesight.
   ``Did the skyscrapers and cars surprise you at all?'' someone
asked.
   ``Skyscrapers sir?'' the playfully bewildered Sommerfield asked.
   Minutes later he was driven away in a dented old Plymouth.

<HEAD>Karajan Resigns As Berlin Philharmonic Director</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with more background, details</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herbert von Karajan, an internationally acclaimed
conductor who sold 150 million albums worldwide, resigned today
after 34 years as director of the Berlin Philharmonic.
   Karajan, whose chronic back problems have made it difficult for
him to walk to a podium, cited frail health as his reason for
resigning, said Anke Martiny, West Berlin's culture senator.
   She said she received a letter today from Karajan informing her
that he was stepping down immediately.
   Karajan was appointed ``conductor for life'' of the Berlin
orchestra in 1955, and his resignation leaves open one of the most
coveted conductor's posts. Many leading conductors have been
mentioned as possible successors since Karajan's health began to
deteriorate, but his resignation letter made no recommendation.
   Karajan, who turned 81 on April 5, was born in Salzburg and
keeps a residence in the Austrian resort. A child prodigy who made
his piano debut at age 5, he now earns an estimated $6.2 million
annually from his recordings.
   He joined the Nazi party while a rising young musical star
during Hitler's reign, and his involvement was still drawing
criticism more than 40 years after the end of World War II.
   Because of his Nazi links, the Allies banned Karajan from
performing for two years after the war and required him to undergo
a ``de-Nazification'' program. In an interview, Karajan once said
he had joined the Nazis so his would not be jeopardized but
insisted he had no sympathies for the group.
   In his letter of resignation read by Mrs. Martiny, Karajan said:
``I kindly ask you to note that as of today's date, I am ending my
work as artistic director and permanent conductor of the Berlin
Philharmonic.''
   ``The results of the medical examinations, which now have
stretched for weeks, make it impossible for me to fulfill my
obligations,'' the letter said.
   Mrs. Martiny, whose department in the West Berlin legislature is
in charge of the orchestra, said: ``I respect this decision by
Herbert von Karajan, which comes for health reasons.''
   ``Berlin thanks Herbert von Karajan for his long-time, excellent
and successful work,' she said.
   ``I hope that Karajan's friends in Berlin will have one more
opportunity to see him conducting the Berlin Philharmonic'' in a
farewell performance, Mrs. Martiny said.
   Karajan had major back surgery in 1976 and had to learn again to
walk properly after crushing nerves in his back two years later
when he collapsed at the podium in Berlin.
   His frail health forced him to cancel several performances with
the orchestra and earlier this year he said he was reducing his
1989 performances from 12 to six.
   His last performance in the United States was Feb. 28, 1988, at
Carnegie Hall with the Vienna Philharmonic.

<HEAD>Scientists to Study Role of Sulfur in Climate Change</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international team of scientists will take
to the ocean in May to study the role played by sulfur gases in
changing the Earth's climate.
   Researchers from the United States and the Soviet Union will
take part in the study, focusing on sulfur gases released from the
water in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration said today.
   Sulfur gases are oxidized in the air and the resulting chemicals
are thought to influence the reflectivity of clouds in the sky,
according to Dr. Timothy Bates of NOAA's Pacific Marine
Environmental Laboratory in Seattle.
   Scientists are trying to determine the overall effect of clouds
in climate. That is because clouds reflect some of the energy from
the sun back into space, but at the same time they trap some of the
heat the Earth itself would radiate away. The balance of heat
trapped and that reflected varies with the reflectivity of the
clouds.
   The 12-day research trip aboard the NOAA Ship McArthur will
allow the scientists to measure the sulfur and nitrogen particles
in the air and better calculate their influence on clouds.
   At the same time, measurements of clouds themselves will be made
by aircraft from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
the University of Washington and Battelle Pacific Northwest
Laboratories.
   Other research organizations participating in the study include
the National Science Foundation, Department of Defense, Department
of Energy, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, University of
Arizona, Georgia Institute of Technology, University of Miami, the
Soviet Institute of Atmospheric Physics and the Soviet Institute of
Applied Geophysics.

<HEAD>Text of Bush's Remarks at Iowa Memorial Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are remarks delivered by President Bush
at the memorial service Monday for victims of last week's explosion
and fire aboard the USS Iowa.
   We join today in mourning for the 47 who perished, and in fact,
for the 11 who survived. They all were, in the words of a poet,
``the men behind the guns.'' They came from Hidalgo, Texas;
Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa, Florida; Costa Mesa, California. They came
to the Navy as strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends,
and left the Navy as brothers in eternity. In the finest Navy
tradition, they served proudly on a great battleship, the USS Iowa.
   This dreadnaught, built long before these sailors were born,
braved the wartime waters of the Atlantic to take President
Roosevelt to meet Winston Churchill in Casa Blanca, and anchored in
Tokyo Harbor on the day that World War II ended. The Iowa earned 11
battle stars in two wars. October of '44 off the coast of the
Philippines, I can still remember. For those of us serving in
carriers in Halsey's 3rd Fleet, having Iowa nearby really built our
confidence. I was proud to be a part of the recommissioning
ceremony in 1984.
   And now, fate has written a sorrowful chapter in this history of
this great ship. Let me say to the crew of Iowa, I understand your
great grief. I promise you today we will find out why, the
circumstances of the tragedy. But in a larger sense, there will
never be answers to the questions that haunt us. We will not,
cannot, as long as we live, know why God has called them home.
   But one thing we can be sure, this world is a more peaceful
place because of the USS Iowa. The Iowa was recommissioned and her
crew trained to preserve the peace. So never forget that your
friends died for the cause of peace and freedom.
   To the Navy community, remember that you have the admiration of
America for sharing the burden of grief as a family, especially the
Navy wives, who suffer most the hardships of separation. You've
always been strong for the sake of love. You must be heroically
strong now. But you will find that love endures _ it endures in the
lingering memory of time together, in the embrace of a friend, in
the bright questioning eyes of a child.
   And as for the children of the loss, throughout your lives you
must never forget your father was America's pride. Your mothers and
grandmothers, aunts and uncles are entrusted with the memory of
this day. In the years to come, they must pass along to you the
legacy of the men behind the guns.
   And to all who mourn a son, a brother, a husband, a father, a
friend, I can only offer you the gratitude of a nation, for your
loved one served his country with distinction and honor.
   I hope that the sympathy and appreciation of all the American
people provide some comfort, but true comfort comes from prayer and
faith. And your men are under a different command now, one that
knows no rank, only love; knows no danger, only peace. May God
bless them all.

   An explosion rocked the underbelly of the
Ford Motor Co. Rouge Complex today, and two sewer workers were
reported missing.
   The 6:20 a.m. blast, apparently centered in the sewer system
near the main powerhouse, overturned cars, blew manholes into the
air and tore holes 20 feet to 30 feet in diameter in the parking
lot, said Ford spokesman Bill Carroll.
   ``It sent shock waves (through sewer tunnels) and vented itself
through these tunnels and into a parking lot,'' he said.
   Carroll said two workers cleaning the sewer system for an
outside company were missing. A few Ford workers were slightly
injured in the blast and were treated at a medical center in the
complex, he said. There was no fire.
   The cause of the explosion was not immediately known.
   The blast interrupted power to the complex, which contains a
steelmaking operation, an auto assembly plant and other Ford
operations.
   Carroll said that the blast shut down computers and other
operations but that it was unclear this morning how much of the
complex continued to operate.
   However, a United Auto Workers source who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the assembly plant, which builds the Mustang, a
glass plant and a stamping plant were shut down, mainly because of
a lack of compressed air to operate machinery.
   The source said 7,000 to 8,000 first-shift employees of the
17,500 workers in the complex were sent home.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Environmentalists on Pesticide Dinoseb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that a federal judge may overrule federal environmental officials
and permit use of an allegedly dangerous pesticide.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by
environmentalists and organized labor in a case of particular
importance to farmers in Idaho, Oregon and Washington state.
   The Environmental Protection Agency invoked emergency powers in
1986 to suspend use of the pesticide dinoseb because of potential
health risks to workers exposed to it.
   Federal officials were concerned particularly that the chemical
could cause birth defects in the unborn children of pregnant women.
   Farmers and food processors in the Pacific Northwest sued in
federal court to block the EPA order.
   They said dinoseb is the only pesticide available to protect
their crops, such as berries, beans, cucumbers and other members of
the gourd family. Oregon state officials supported the suit.
   U.S. District Judge James A. Redden in Oregon ruled in favor of
the farmers and food processors.
   He said the farmers may use dinoseb if they meet 12 conditions,
among them a requirement that female workers of child-bearing age
be barred from exposure to the chemical.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld Redden's
authority to overturn the EPA's emergency ban on dinoseb.
   ``Crop losses of over $39 million may look like small potatoes
from Washington, D.C.,'' the appeals court said. ``But...such
losses would cause very serious economic hardships to the people of
the Northwest.''
   The appeals court, however, said Redden does not have the power
to impose conditions for dinoseb's use.
   The appeals court sent the case back to the judge to decide
whether he would permit unrestricted use of the pesticide.
   The AFL-CIO, the Natural Resources Defense Council and others
appealed to the Supreme Court. They said the appeals court ruling
threatens ``the EPA's authority to act decisively when the use of
pesticides threatens to create a public health emergency.''
   The Bush administration agreed that the appeals court
misinterpreted federal law in granting federal judges power to
overturn such EPA decisions. But Justice Department lawyers told
the high court to reject the appeal by the environmentalists and
organized labor.
   They said the impact of the appeals court ruling is speculative.
   The case is AFL-CIO vs. Love, 88-1255.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government-backed presidential
candidate has angrily accused Washington of blatant interference in
Panama's affairs after reports President Bush approved more than
$10 million for the opposition.
   Carlos Duque said in a speech Sunday that the reported aid was
``brazen intervention'' in the campaign that ends with nationwide
elections on May 7. He said he thought the actual amount of aid was
much higher than $10 million.
   Duque is backed by de facto ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
with whom the U.S. government has long been at odds.
   The May 1 issue of U.S. News and World Report said Bush in
February signed the secret intelligence directive to give $10
million to the Panamanian opposition.
   The magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying Bush personally
lobbied the plan through the congressional intelligence committees
and won approval for the CIA to provide more than $10 million in
aid. It says the money was to be used for printing, advertising,
transportation and communications for candidates opposing Noriega.
   Reagan set a similar program in motion a year ago, the magazine
said. The New York Times reported today that the Reagan
administration plan was intended to dislodge Noriega without
violence. Failing that, the plan called for a coup by a
U.S.-supported rebel force led by Col. Eduardo Herrara, a
Panamanian exile in Miami, the Times said, quoting government
officials.
   The plan, which was created by executive branch agencies, was
rejected by the Senate Intelligence Committee, apparently because
of the possibility that Noriega might be assassinated, the Times
said. A presidential order bars American participation in
assassinations.
   Asked about the U.S. News report Saturday, White House
spokeswoman Alixe Glen said, ``I can't comment on intelligence
matters.''
   She added that the U.S. official position remains opposed to
Noreiga but the government does not back any candidates there.
   ``Our position remains the same. We want to return democracy to
the Panamanian people.'' She added, however, ``It's the Panamanian
people that vote.''
   On May 7, Panamanians will chose a new president, two vice
presidents, 67 legislators and 510 local representatives.
   The opposition Democratic Alliance Coalition has emerged as the
strongest competition for the government-backed National Liberation
Coalition in the upcoming election.
   It is backing Guillermo Endara, who has called the election a
plebiscite on Noriega's de facto rule.
   Last spring, the United States imposed economic sanctions
against Panama in an attempt to force out the powerful leader of
the Defense Forces.
   The sanctions were imposed after Noriega was indicted by two
federal grand juries in Florida on drug trafficking charges and he
orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Delvalle
had tried to fire Noriega after the indictment.
   Noriega denies the U.S. criminal charges.
   Bush this month extended the sanctions, which include sharp
restrictions on U.S. companies that do business in Panama, a hold
on assets of the Panamanian government in the United States and a
prohibition on tax payments by U.S. organizations to Panama.
   U.S. officials have raised the possibility that the sanctions
could be eased if the May 7 elections are deemed to be fair. But
the officials have expressed pessimism that that will be the case.
   During his Sunday campaign speech in Chorrera, 25 miles west of
Panama City, Duque told thousands of supporters that the opposition
plans to create violence and chaos during the elections.

<HEAD>President Says Drugs Worst Problem Facing Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Drugs, drugs and drugs'' are the three worst
problems facing American schools because drug abuse affects morale
and discipline in the classroom, President Bush says on a program
being telecast tonight on most Public Broadcasting Service stations.
   Bush, interviewed for the last segment of a five-part series
called ``Learning In America,'' also said it is not up to the
federal government to ensure equity in education and said freedom
of choice in public schools could help ease that problem.
   Asked by PBS correspondent Roger Mudd to name the three most
pressing U.S. education problems, Bush replied, ``Drugs, drugs and
drugs... I hope that's not a frivolous answer, but I want to say it
that way because of the impact that drugs are having.
   ``They have it on the morale of teachers. They have it on
discipline in the classroom. They have ... the adverse impact on
the areas that need help the most.''
   Bush said the nation must find some way to signal to teachers
``that we respect those who choose that profession, and find ways
to encourage more to do it.''
   But he said he didn't really know the answer to the question of
how to reward teachers and acknowledged that ``they're never going
to have it made... in a financial sense.''
   On another education matter, Mudd asked if it is fair for a
child in a ghetto high school in Camden, N.J., to have less than
$4,000 spent on him while $7,000 is spent on a child in affluent
Princeton, N.J. ``Is that not a violation of civil rights?'' he
asked Bush.
   ``No, it is not a violation,'' Bush replied. ``Is it fair that
football coach makes 10 times as much as a high school teacher? Is
it far that a television announcer on the network news every night
makes 20 times or 30 or 40 times as much as a teacher that's trying
to keep your kid and mine out of narcotics?''
   ``I'm not sure everything is equitable, and I am sure, though,
that the federal government can't smooth out everything like this.''
   The president said the situation would improve if parents were
able to choose the public school their child attended. ``They might
not be able to move from Camden to Princeton, but if we have this
choice take hold, they can move into a school that is less heavily
impacted by drugs ...,'' he said.
   Mudd also told Bush that at least two governers _ Democrat Bill
Clinton of Arkansas and Republican James Thompson of Illinois have
run into opposition when they have tried to get their legislatures
to approve new taxes for education improvements.
   The interviewer attributed the legislative stone wall to Bush's
success running against new taxes last fall.
   Bush replied that the federal government should ``hold the line
on taxes and not create taxes that take away from the state's
resource base. And so I would let each state governor, obviously,
make his own decision or her own decision. But I will not
criticize, nor extend the read-my-lips (no new taxes) syndrome to
every governor that ... is mandated to balance budgets.''

<HEAD>Court Leaves Intact $101 Million Telephone Customer Refund</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $101
million refund the nation's telephone companies were ordered to pay
customers for excessive charges in 1978.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the Federal
Communications Commission overstepped its authority in ordering the
refunds.
   The commission in 1976 allowed American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
Co. to set phone rates designed to yield a rate of return of up to
10 percent a year.
   AT&amp;T's earnings in 1978 exceeded the 10 percent figure by $101
million, the commission ruled in 1984.
   By that year, AT&amp;T had divested itself of its regional operating
companies in settling a federal antitrust lawsuit.
   The commission therefore ordered the regional companies to
reduce their phone rates so their customers would receive the $101
million refund.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here, in a 2-1 ruling in 1987,
upheld the commission's orders. The appeals court rejected
arguments that the reduced rates are a retroactive refund in
violation of federal law.
   The telephone companies also said ordering refunds is unfair
because AT&amp;T's rate of return in 1976 was only 9.25 percent, yet
the phone companies were not permitted to raise customer rates to
make up the shortfall.
   The appeals court said the rate of return approved by the
commission is not designed to assure a certain minimum level of
earnings for the companies each year.
   The companies ``are entitled only to earn an overall reasonable
return,'' the appeals court said. The commission ``has concluded
that a guaranteed minimum annual return is not essential to protect
that right. That conclusion is a reasonable one.''
   In addition, the appeals court upheld the commission's decision
that the companies also refund interest earned on the $101 million.
   ``We perceive no inequity in requiring (the companies) to pay
full interest on earnings they had no right to retain in the first
place,'' the appeals court said.
   The Communications Satellite Corp. (COMSAT) supported the phone
companies' position. The satellite communications company was
ordered by the commission last year to refund $38.8 million to its
customers.
   The cases are Southern Bell vs. FCC, 88-1249, and New England
Telephone vs. FCC, 88-1250.

   The ``Flintstones'' cartoon characters filled in
for one morning television program today and silence greeted many
radio listeners as thousands of British Broadcasting Corp. workers
went on strike for higher pay.
   The 24-hour walkout by 18,000 of the BBC's 25,000 employees
forced nearly all live programs on the corporation's four national
radio networks and two television channels to be canceled or
shortened. This affected half the nation's non-cable television and
all national radio stations.
   The BBC radio canceled its World Service, which broadcasts all
over the globe, with morning news commentary programs, financial
reports and the daily review of the British press.
   Morning television viewers were met with the ``Flintstones,'' a
food program and a film about stunt rider Evel Knievel instead of
the usual two-hour ``Breakfast Time'' news and current affairs show.
   Journalists joined technicians on picket lines in West London
and demonstrations were planned for Glasgow, Belfast, Manchester,
Birmingham and other major cities.
   The strike began at midnight to demand a 16 percent pay rise
that would bring salaries in line with those in commercial
broadcasting. The BBC has offered an average 7 percent increase.
   ``At the lowest levels, BBC pay is, quite simply, abysmal,''
wrote Simon Gallimore, a BBC union representative in a letter to
the daily Independent. He said the publicly funded service was
suffering a ``hemorrhage of experienced and skilled staff,'' to
commercial networks, because of the low wages.
   The national average for a BBC journalist is the equivalent of
$29,000 a year, compared with $41,000 in commercial radio or
television network, Gallimore's union said.
   At the BBC, a radio engineer earns up to $18,210 a year while a
cameraman earns up to $20,280.
   The strike silenced many hourly radio newscasts. There were none
between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. on the light entertainment Radio 2, and
an announcer explained that the network was unable to provide live
programs ``at this time.''
   ``We are attempting to maintain as good a service as possible,''
said a BBC spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   Radio 2 music programs were disrupted from 5:30 a.m. onward as
disc jockeys stayed away.
   The ``Today'' current affairs program on Radio 4, the main news
channel, was also canceled, and replaced with previously-recorded
items, while announcers read shortened newscasts.
   The BBC subsists on compulsory public subscription. A year's
license fee for a black-and-white TV set is the equivalent of $36,
and $107 for a color set. The BBC management says the fee has not
risen in line with inflation, and has left the corporation short of
funds.

<HEAD>Harvard Student Council Wants ROTC Back on Campus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty years after ROTC was driven off
the Harvard University campus, the student council wants it back.
   In a 41-24 vote Sunday, the Undergraduate Council asked the
university to negotiate with the military to bring back Reserve
Officers' Training Corps programs, which prepare students for
appointments as military officers.
   The military left Harvard in 1969 after the university withdrew
academic credit for ROTC and decided it should be an
extracurricular activity with no special privileges. The edict
followed a building takeover and a student strike.
   Now, the 150 or so Harvard students who take part in ROTC
programs do so at the nearby Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Harvard spokeswoman Marjorie Heffron said a return by ROTC would
have to be approved by the faculty.
   ``If they try to get that through the faculty, there would be
quite a fight,'' Dr. Warren E.C. Wacker, head of the university's
health services, told the Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper.
   The student council vote followed two hours of heated debate.
The resolution was sponsored by two ROTC candidates and had the
backing of the council's leadership, the newspaper said.
   Joel Hornstein, a freshman who supported the measure, said it
wasn't intended as an endorsement of the military.
   ``I don't think there's anyone in ROTC who blindly supports
everything our government or our military does,'' he said.
   Army, Navy and Air Force ROTC programs provide financial aid to
participants.

<HEAD>Court to Review Order Raising Property Taxes to Help Desegregate
Kansas City Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
judge's order raising property taxes to help pay for racially
desegregating public schools in Kansas City, Mo.
   The justices said they will hear arguments that the judge
overstepped his authority when imposing the tax hike for all
property within the city's school district.
   A series of orders by U.S. District Judge Russell G. Clark that
would cost hundreds of millions of dollars to implement was
challenged in appeals by state and county officials and school
district taxpayers.
   Most of the judge's orders were upheld by the 8th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals last Aug. 19.
   The funding controversy dates back to a 1977 lawsuit seeking to
correct the physical decline of predominantly black schools in
Kansas City.
   Before 1954, Missouri law required schools to be racially
segregated. From 1954 to 1984 the percentage of black students in
Kansas City's school district climbed from 22.5 percent to 67.7
percent.
   In a 1987 ruling, Clark found that the city school district's
``physical facilities have literally rotted,'' and ordered the
state and school district to upgrade them.
   In upholding most of the judge's order, the 8th Circuit court
said, ``There are still vestiges of the dual school system
lingering in the (city school district), and the district and the
state have not met their obligations to disestablish that system.''
   The judge's orders called for two major remedies:
   _A ``magnet school'' plan providing that by the 1991-92 school
year every high school and middle school in the city, and about
half the elementary schools, will feature distinctive themes such
as foreign languages, performing arts or math and science.
   _A capital improvements program costing some $260 million, to be
completed by the fall of 1990.
   To enable the city school district to pay its share of the
desegregation plan's costs, the judge imposed a 1.5 percent income
tax surcharge and hiked school district property taxes to $4 per
$100 assessed valuation through the 1991-92 fiscal year.
   The state's appeal, granted review today, says the $4 per $100
levy represented a doubling of the local property tax.
   Clark ordered the tax increases because no money was available
to finance the construction of new schools. Between 1970 and 1983,
school district voters had turned down six proposals to increase
taxes for education.
   He also authorized the school district to issue $150 million in
20-year capital improvement bonds.
   The appeals court upheld the property tax hike but struck down
the income tax surcharge, which had raised some $30 million before
being invalidated.
   The state was ordered to pay 75 percent of the desegregation
costs; the school district the remaining 25 percent.
   The state appeal acted on today said the lower court rulings
``rest upon an unwarranted extension of this court's desegregation
cases.''
   The appeal said the magnet school remedy was, as ordered by
Clark, overbroad _ ``unlike any ever ordered by a federal court.''
   The appeal also said that ``the order imposing a tax increase is
outside the bounds of judicial authority.''
   In a brief order, the justices rejected two appeals filed in the
case, and limited review of the state's appeal to the validity of
the ordered tax increase.
   The cases are Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-1150; Clark vs. Jenkins,
88-1194; and Jackson County vs. Jenkins, 88-1228.

<HEAD>Whaling Ship Returns After Killing 241 Whales</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whaling supporters welcomed home the mother ship of
Japan's whaling fleet today after a four-month hunt in the
Antarctic in which it dodged protesters and killed 241 whales.
   The Nisshin Maru No. 3's return marked the end of the second
year of Japan's research whaling program, which it launched after
officially ending commercial whaling in 1987 to comply with a ban
imposed by the International Whaling Commission.
   In a welcoming ceremony on the ship's long, rusted deck,
officials promised the 120 crew members they would seek an end to
the ban, which is to be re-evaluated in 1990.
   ``I understand that you had many difficulties on your voyage,''
Fukujiro Kikuchi, a Parliament member, told the crew. ``We're doing
our best in the hope that sometime, somewhere Japan will be able to
resume commercial whaling.''
   Below the 23,000-ton ship's deck were 241 minke whales already
prepared into meat in the vessel's processing plant.
   When Japanese whaling was at its peak in the early 1960s, whales
provided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country. Declining
supplies since then have turned whale meat into a delicacy, but
Japan is still the world's largest consumer of whale flesh.
   Under the International Whaling Commission charter, member
nations may conduct research whaling at any time without permission
from the commission and then use the meat. Japan says it hopes to
show through its research that some whale species are plentiful
enough to allow a resumption of limited commercial whaling.
   Estimates of the current number of minkes, a smaller species,
range from 400,000 to 700,000.
   But international environmental groups such as Greenpeace have
charged that Japan is using the research provision as a ploy to
continue whaling, and that non-lethal research methods are
available.
   Greenpeace members used a ship and rubber rafts to try to block
the Nisshin Maru and its three catcher boats during their hunt in
the Antarctic, and had one minor collision with the mother ship.
   Hidehiro Kato, director of research on board the Nisshin Maru,
said the voyage had shown that the random sampling methods used in
the research could be applied to a broader research program.
   ``I'd prefer to use non-lethal methods, but they aren't able to
tell us age, reproductive status or condition of the whales,'' he
said. ``At this point, the best approach is a combination of lethal
and non-lethal research.''
   Japanese officials have said at least 825 whales must be caught
each season to make the research program scientifically accurate.
But because of strong international opposition, they reduced this
year's goal to 300.
   Kato said bad weather was primarily responsible for the fleet's
falling short of the goal, but that the protests ``had some
effect.''
   ``The research whaling was approved by the Japanese
government,'' said Hideyoshi Yoshida, a crew member. ``So I wish
people opposed to it would discuss it with the government, rather
than confronting us while we're whaling.''
   Yoshida sats he took a year off from a fisheries college for a
chance to work on the ship and visit the Antarctic.

<HEAD>Court to Decide Issue of Taxing Utility Deposits in Indiana Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the government may tax as income the deposits that utility
companies demand from customers to insure payment of future bills.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal in a
case involving an Indiana electric utility.
   Administration officials said a considerable amount of money
could be at stake. The Internal Revenue Service estimated that more
than 150 such cases involving over $300 million in potential taxes
are pending in the courts or before the IRS.
   The case acted on today stems from a deposit policy of the
Indianapolis Power and Light Co.
   The policy, as amended in 1976, required some electricity
customers to deposit up to twice their estimated monthly bills with
the company.
   The company required the deposits from new customers whose
creditworthiness was in doubt and from existing customers with a
record of late payment of their bills.
   The utility paid 6 percent annual interest on the deposits to
customers if it held the money for at least a year. The deposit was
refunded if the customer met a credit test, or if the customer's
bill was paid on time for nine straight months or for 10 out of 12
months.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last September upheld a
ruling by the U.S. Tax Court that the deposits were not a form of
advance payment, and thus the utility did not have to pay federal
income tax on them.
   The appeals court accepted the tax court's interpretation that
the money was meant as security for the utility, not advance
payment of a customer's bill.
   Justice Department lawyers, in urging the high court to overturn
the 7th Circuit court ruling, noted that another federal appeals
court has ruled the opposite way. The government's appeal urged the
justices to resolve the conflict.
   The case is Commissioner of IRS vs. Indianapolis Power, 88-1319.

<HEAD>Business Owners Gripe About Proposed Tough New Smog Controls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business owners are griping about tough new
anti-smog measures that could transform the way Southern
Californians live and work.
   They say the regulations are too costly and in some cases rely
on technology that is unavailable.
   The new anti-smog plan by the South Coast Air Quality Management
District touches virtually every aspect of everyday life, from
underarm deodorants and swimming pools to cars, drive-through
restaurants and backyard barbecues.
   Oliver Coury, who operates Coury &amp; Son Dry Cleaners in Redondo
Beach, said he wants more time to make changes.
   ``We all contribute to air pollution, so we don't know who is
doing what to what,'' Coury said. ``I believe in everybody
tightening up, but within limits of the equipment and costs we can
afford. But they're pushing the little people more than the big
people.''
   The agency would require dry cleaners to buy new all-in-one
machines to keep fumes from escaping when clothes are transferred
from washers to dryers. Coury said the machines cost up to $70,000.
   Those changes are in the first stage of a far-reaching proposal
approved in general March 17 by the AQMD. Each of the plan's three
stages still must be approved by the 12-member board after hearings
later this year.
   Stage One requires that readily available air pollution controls
be imposed over the next five years.
   Stage Two, to go into effect by 2000, would require significant
technological advances mostly to control motor vehicles and
producers of paint and solvents.
   Stage Three could be implemented in the next century with
long-range technological breakthroughs that are unavailable now,
such as advances in solar cells and superconductors.
   Don Burns, a lobbyist for the swimming pool and spa industry,
said many people see the demands as unrealistic. For example,
adding solar panels to heat pools and spas could add up to $14,000
to the price of a pool, he said.
   R.E. Robinson of the Southern California Paint and Coatings
Association said his industry doesn't know how to make paints and
other coatings that are as low in volatile organic compounds as the
district wants.
   ``We obviously don't know how to do that or how it's going to be
done right now. But who knows what's going to happen in 10 or 20
years,'' he said.
   Sandra Burton of the Barbecue Industry Association said her
industry can't reformulate charcoal starter fluid to give off lower
emissions.
   Auto spray paint shops worry about rules that would require them
to use less-volatile paints and improve nozzles so less paint is
blown into the air.
   ``It's going to be difficult, there's no denying that. Most
everyone is going to have to reformulate their paint,'' said Ray
Poulin, who supervises five Earl Scheib shops. ``It's going to be
expensive changing equipment we already have, like spray guns.''

<HEAD>Court to Consider Reinstating Death Sentence of Oklahoma Man</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to consider
reinstating the death sentence of a convicted Oklahoma killer whose
jury was told to ``avoid any influence of sympathy.''
   The justices said they will review a ruling that the jury
instructions deprived Robyn Leroy Parks of a fair sentencing trial.
   The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, by a 6-4 vote last Oct.
20, said Parks is entitled to a new sentencing trial.
   The October ruling, however, did not disturb Park's murder
conviction for the Aug. 17, 1977, shooting death of Abdullah
Ibrahim, an Oklahoma City gas station attendant.
   At Park's sentencing trial, the presiding judge told jurors,
among other things, ``You must avoid any influence of sympathy,
sentiment, passion, prejudice or other arbitrary factor when
imposing sentence.''
   The 10th Circuit court said that instruction ``undermined the
jury's consideration of the mitigating evidence'' _ factors
suggesting life imprisonment rather than death as the appropriate
punishment.
   The Supreme Court in 1987 upheld a California murderer's death
sentence even though jurors in that case were told they should not
be swayed by ``mere sympathy.''
   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, said in the California case that a
reasonable juror would ``understand the instruction not to rely on
`mere sympathy' as a directive to ignore only the sort of sympathy
that would be totally divorced from the evidence adduced during the
penalty phase.''
   In Parks' case, the appeals court noted that ``the anti-sympathy
instruction ... is not modified by the word `mere,' which (the 1987
Supreme Court decisions) considered crucial.''
   In the appeal acted on today, Oklahoma prosecutors argued, ``The
Constitution does not require sympathy in capital sentencing.''
   They added, ``No reasonable juror would interpret the admonition
to avoid the influence of sympathy as a secret code designed to
denigrate the defendant's case in mitigation.''
   The case is Saffle vs. Parks, 88-1264.

<HEAD>Court Won't Hear Appeal on Limiting Pension Benefits for Retired
Union Officer in San Francisco Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear an
appeal by a labor union seeking to limit pension benefits for one
of its retired officers.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the retired
official did not wait too long to file a federal lawsuit in San
Francisco seeking increased benefits.
   The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers (IAM) amended its retirement benefit plan effective Jan. 1,
1977.
   The change, designed to save money and protect the plan's
future, eliminated a so-called ``living pension'' feature.
   It had guaranteed retired union officials they would receive
pension increases equal to any future salary hikes for the position
from which they retired.
   The union, as employer, funds the pension plan.
   The elimination of the living pension feature was challenged by
Frank Meagher, who had been a union officer for 20 years when he
reitred July 1, 1977.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last September that
Meagher is entitled to the benefits of the living pension feature.
   The appeals court said the the elimination of the feature has
not taken legal effect under the federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act because it never has been approved by the U.S.
Secretary of the Treasury.
   Therefore, the appeals court said, Meagher did not miss the
deadline for suing over the feature's elimination even though he
did not sue until May 13, 1986.
   The appeals court said Meagher is entitled to any pension
increases that would take effect under the living pension feature
from May 13, 1983, onward.
   IAM officials, who said Meagher is receiving a monthly pension
check of about $2,700, said the ruling could be extremely costly
and damaging for pension plans generally.
   Pension benefit plan changes ``made in good faith could be the
subject of expensive litigation decades after they were made,'' the
union said.
   The appeal acted on today was supported by several business
groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   The case is International Association of Machinists vs. Meagher,
88-1427.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian rockets exploded near a power
plant in Lebanon's besieged Christian heartland today as a nearby
French tanker unloaded fuel needed to reactivate Beirut's power
stations, police said.
   A spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the four
rockets hit 1.5 miles north of the power plant at Zouk.
   Despite the attack, no casualties or damage was reported as the
French naval vessel, the Penhors, unloaded the desperately needed
fuel oil at the Zouk port.
   Earlier, Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun ordered two
Cypriot ferries to stop sailing to Lebanon today, suspending the
Christians' only escape route while the Penhors unloaded its
precious cargo.
   An aide to Aoun said France demanded ferry service be halted
while the Penhors unloads the fuel needed to restore electricity to
Beirut after a nine-day blackout.
   ``That's the deal worked out by France to strip the Syrian army
and its Druse allies from any pretext for shelling the Christian
enclave,'' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Aoun ordered the ferry service halted Sunday night as the
Cypriot-flagged Baroness M headed to the port of Jounieh, 12 miles
north of Beirut. An Associated Press reporter aboard the 4,000-ton
ferry said the vessel turned back to Larnaca, Cyprus.
   Baroness M and another Cypriot ship, the Larnaca Rose, have
shuttled about 15,000 people from Lebanon since the latest round of
fighting began March 8.
   At least 270 people have been killed and 975 wounded in fighting
between Aoun's 20,000-strong army and allied Syrian troops and
Druse militiamen. Residential areas in Beirut have been bombarded
by rocket and artillery attacks. Most of those killed or wounded
have been civilians.
   Asked how long the ferry service would be suspended, Aoun's aide
said: ``That depends on how long the Penhors will stay in Lebanese
territorial waters.''
   The French ship unloaded 2,000 tons of fuel at the Zahrani oil
harbor, 30 miles south of Beirut, on Sunday to restart a power
plant in nearby Druse-controlled Jiye.
   The tanker docked today at Zouk in the Christian heartland north
of Beirut to unload 4,000 tons of fuel for the power plant there.
   Mitri Nammar, the electricity authority director, said it would
take Penhors nine hour to unload the fuel at Zouk.
   He said the authority will rotate electric supplies among Beirut
districts, providing each with two hours of power every 24 hours.
He said he also expected the water authority to restart the pumping
system on a rotating basis.
   Beirut has been without electricity and water since April 16
when fuel tanks ran dry. Residents also are suffering from acute
shortages of food.
   Christian-controlled radio stations said Syrian gunners lobbed
18 artillery shells on the coast north of the Christian port of
Byblos overnight. They said there were no casualties from the
intermittent firing on the region 19 miles north of Beirut.
   Each side has accused the other of using the recent relative
lull in the warfare to prepare for a major escalation to coincide
with an emergency Arab League meeting on Wednesday in the Tunisia.
   The meeting was scheduled after three cease-fires called by the
Arab League failed to halt the fighting, which broke out after Aoun
clamped a blockade on illegal militia-run ports.
   Aoun, head of a military Cabinet vying for legitimacy against a
mostly Moslem Cabinet under acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, had
said the bloackade was designed to restore state authority eroded
by 14 years of civil war.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party,
which fields a 7,000-strong militia, responded to the blockade by
shelling Christian residential areas.
   The Syrian forces later joined in the shelling, allied with the
Druse.

<HEAD>Court Sets Aside Awards Won by Families of Uraguayans Killed in Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today set aside $720,000 in
awards won by the families of five Uraguayans who were among the
154 people killed in a 1982 airline crash in Kenner, La.
   The justices ordered a federal appeals court to restudy the case
in light of their decision last week that international airline
passengers do not have to be warned about the $75,000-per-person
liability cap for death or injury.
   Pan American World Airways Flight 759 crashed outside of New
Orleans shortly after its takeoff from Moisant International
Airport on July 9, 1982. Investigators concluded that a wind shear
contributed to the accident.
   More than 50 of the crash victims were foreign tourists.
   Pan Am never has contested its liability for the accident, and
the numerous lawsuits stemming from the crash have been limited to
the question of what damages should be paid.
   The two families of the five Uraguayans _ Luis and Electra
Trivelloni-Lorenzi, Sara Lopez de Pampin, Amparo Pampin Lopez and
Irma Lopez de Alvarez _ were awarded a total of $720,000 by a
federal jury in New Orleans.
   The trial was held only after Pan Am's request that it be
allowed to defend against the two suits in Uraguay was denied.
   U.S. District Judge Adrian G. Duplantier noted that the federal
government likely would become a defendant after administrative
maneuvers were completed, and that the government could not be
forced to defend itself in Uraguayan courts.
   He also ruled that Pan Am could not invoke the Warsaw
Convention, a treaty covering international airplane travel, to
limit its liability to $75,000 for each death.
   Duplantier said Pan Am could not benefit from the treaty because
the limited liability was discussed on passenger tickets in too
small a size of print _ 9-point rather than 10-point.
   His ruling was upheld by the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals last July 21.
   On April 18, the Supreme Court ruled in a similar case stemming
from the Soviet downing of a Korean Air Lines jet that claimed 269
lives in 1983.
   The justices ruled that KAL cannot be penalized for its failure
to use the proper size type on its tickets to alert passengers to
the $75,000 limit.
   The KAL tickets used 8-point type _ even smaller than that used
on the Pan Am tickets in the case acted on today.
   The case is Pan Am vs. Lopez, 87-750.

<HEAD>Thirteen Killed in Factional Fighting near Durban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days of factional
fighting and firebomb attacks in black townships left 13 dead and
three injured, police said today.
   Three men died Friday in Kwamashu, 12 miles from the Indian
Ocean port of Durban, while in the adjoining township of Inanda,
police on Sunday found the bodies of nine men with head and stab
wounds, according to a police report.
   Also near Durban, a 26-year-old man was apparently stabbed to
death in Taylor's Halt, a black community in Pietermaritzburg,
according to the report issued in Pretoria, the capital.
   In Inanda, two men and a woman were hospitalized in critical
condition with stab wounds, the report said. In the same city,
shops and a bus were set alight in firebombings and two men were
arrested after police traded gunfire with black activists.
   The violence occurred near KwaZulu, where more than 1,000 Zulu
tribesmen have died in fighting among black groups.
   Monitoring groups say, in all, more than 4,000 blacks have died
since unrest against the apartheid race segregation policy broke
out in 1984.
   Durban police said Monday a third group, the Sinyoras gang,
entered the factional fighting during the weekend. The Sinyoras,
named for a song performed by South African singer Brenda Fassie,
reportedly fought United Democratic Front followers who were
protesting the fatal stabbing of a colleague.
   On Sunday, Inkatha leader and KwaZulu black homeland leader,
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, called for a foreign-funded peace campaign to
end fighting between his followers and militant anti-apartheid
groups. The United Front and allied African National Congress view
Buthelezi as a conservative who weakens the struggle for black
rights.
   Both Inkatha and the Democratic Front oppose the apartheid
policies that enable South Africa's 5 million whites to dominate 28
million blacks. But their strategies differ markedly.
   In its early stages, the factional feud focused on allegations
that Inkatha engaged in forced recruitment drives and that
Democratic Front followers sometimes coerced people into joining
anti-apartheid boycotts. More recently, killings have been revenge
attacks or pre-emptive strikes.

<TEXT>
   An increase in drug-related arrests and
stricter sentencing requirements have brought about a 7.4 percent
hike in the number of inmates in federal and state prisons, but
prison capacity hasn't kept up, according to the Justice Department.
   At the end of 1988, a record 627,402 men and women were
incarcerated nationwide, but the most optimistic estimate of prison
capacity said there was room for 566,898. While the prison
population was increasing by 7.4 percent, the prison capacity was
increasing by just 5.5 percent.
   ``The 1988 increase translates into a nationwide need for more
than 800 new prison bed spaces per week,'' said the report written
by Lawrence A. Greenfeld, corrections unit chief for the
department's Bureau of Justice Statistics.
   The FBI, meanwhile, announced that serious crimes nationwide
rose 3 percent between 1987 and 1988. The total number of violent
crimes reported to law enforcement agencies increased 5 percent,
paced by a 7 percent jump in aggravated assaults in the last year,
according to preliminary results of the 1988 Uniform Crime Report.
   The report said motor vehicle thefts increased 11 percent from
last year.
   The 1988 crime index increased 4 percent in the Northeast and
South but registered no change in the Midwest. The index _ the
total number of crimes reported to state and local authorities _
increased 3 percent in the West.
   The report released Sunday said the 42,967 additional prisoners
in 1988 were about 3,500 more than the number added during 1987.
There had been a 7.2 percent hike in 1987 over the previous year.
   The report attributed the increases both to the heightened
likelihood that a serious offender will receive a prison sentence
and a 113 percent increase in the number of adults arrested for
drug trafficking or manufacturing.
   And the Bureau of Prisons expects the increases to continue.
   ``Obviously, the increased efforts of law enforcement to combat
drug problems (will hike the population), as well as the new
sentencing guidelines under which inmates will be serving longer
sentences,'' said Greg Bogdan.
   The federal prison population, which stood at 49,928 at the end
of 1988, a 3.4 percent increase over the 48,300 at the end of 1987,
is expected to reach some 83,500 by 1995, Bogdan said.
   The report said that nationwide, state prisons were operating at
7 percent to 23 percent over capacity, while federal prisons were
estimated to be between 33 percent and 72 percent over capacity.
Bogdan said the federal prisons were operating at an average of 55
percent over capacity.
   During 1988, total state and federal prison capacities increased
by 28,000 to 31,000 beds, depending on how the various
jurisdictions rated capacities, the report found.
   The report, which calculated prison population based both on all
prisoners and on those sentenced to more than one year, called
``sentenced prisoners,'' found that since 1980, the District of
Columbia and the federal prison system have more than doubled the
number of sentenced prisoners.
   Alaska, California, New Hampshire and New Jersey have
experienced a threefold increase since 1980, when total prison
populations in those states were 29,725, to 1988 totals of 93,597.
   The states that have more than doubled the number of such
prisoners since 1980 were Arizona, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii,
Kansas, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, New York,
North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and Utah.
   The incarceration rate, based on the number of people sentenced
to more than one year in prison, reached 244 per 100,000 residents
nationwide. In 1980, the rate was 139 per 100,000.
   The Western states had the highest increase in total prisoners,
11.5 percent, while the Northeast had a 9.2 percent increase, the
Midwest 8.6 percent, and the South 4.7 percent.
   The 10 states with the biggest percentage increase in total
prison population from 1987 to 1988 were Rhode Island, 33.5
percent; Colorado, 24.7 percent; New Hampshire, 17.5 percent,
Michigan, 16.1 percent; California, 13.7 percent; Arizona, 11.1
percent; Missouri, 10.8 percent; Kentucky, 10.6 percent; Nevada,
10.1 percent, and Minnesota, 9.9 percent.
   But the prison population actually declined in seven states, the
report found. The states with declines were South Dakota, down by
10 percent; Washington, down 5.1 percent; Maine, down 2.3 percent;
Tennessee and Alabama, down 1.7 percent; North Carolina, down 0.9
percent, and West Virginia, down 0.2 percent.
   Although men in prison still vastly outnumber the women
incarcerated, the number of women inmates increased at a faster
rate during 1988, 12.5 percent, than the men, 7.1 percent. The
number of women in state and federal prisons grew from 29,064 at
the end of 1987 to 32,691 at the end of 1988, while the number of
men in prison increased from 555,371 to 594,711.

<HEAD>Atlanta Police Believe The Cat Woman Burglar Is Back</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A burglar known as Cat Woman, who has visited the
city annually for a decade and lifted about $1 million in cash,
jewelry and heirlooms from a half-dozen homes last year, may be on
the prowl again, police say.
   ``She called me last month and said she'd be back in town
soon,'' Detective R.L. Lindsey said. ``She said she would stop by
to see me, but she hasn't.''
   The woman, whose many aliases include the name Alice L. McGraw,
is known for her bold style, impeccable taste in other's jewelry
and a steady alibi if caught _ she tells people she's looking for
her lost Siamese cat.
   She's been caught several times and convicted once, in 1983, but
was deported to her native Canada instead of being sent to jail,
police said.
   Police said the 35-year-old woman prefers to enter homes that
are open, usually looking for people working outside who haven't
bothered to lock up, but she's not above breaking in.
   Last year, police suspected her in at least six burglaries, but
she was never picked up.
   ``She comes this way in the springtime, when people are outside
in their yards,'' Lindsey said.
   In two cases since April 13, a woman matching the description of
the Cat Woman was seen near homes that had been broken into or
burglarized.
   Elizabeth Evins said she returned home and saw a woman walk
calmly down her driveway, pause to pull a leaf off a tree, then
turn a corner and walk out of sight. Then Ms. Evins got out of her
car and heard her burglar alarm.
   Ms. Evins found her back door pried open but nothing disturbed
inside.
   ``She is just as bold as you please,'' Ms. Evins said. ``She
walked right by me and didn't even flinch. She's a cool customer.''

<DATELINE>RABAT, Morocco (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hamani Diori, president of Niger after it
won independence from France in 1960 until he was ousted in a coup
14 years later, has died, officials said today. He was 73.
   The Moroccan government officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, provided no cause of death.
   Before independence, Diori founded the Niger Progressive Party
that favored close ties with France. He was the clear choice to
lead the nation among French officials, who banned competing
political parties.
   Diori was elected to three five-year terms. His rule was
troubled by domestic strife, political instability, allegations of
corruption and the catostrophic Sahelian drought of the 1960s and
early 1970s.
   During his reign, stories of corruption at the highest levels
became widespread. Government officials were accused of hoarding
food aid and selling it at inflated prices instead of distributing
it to the hungry.
   On April 15, 1974, the army chief of staff, Lt. Col. Seyni
Kountche, took power in a coup that met with resistence only at the
palace gates. An unknown number of people were killed, including
Diori's wife.
   The former president was imprisoned until April 1980 and then
held under house arrest. He was freed following Kountche's death in
a Paris hospital in 1987 and since then had made his home in the
Moroccan capital of Rabat.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Whether Indian Tribe Can Prosecute Members of Other
Tribes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether an Indian tribe can prosecute members of other tribes for
crimes on its reservation.
   The court said it will review a ruling that gives the Salt River
Pima-Maricopa Community in Arizona authority to prosecute a
California man accused in the fatal shooting of a 14-year old boy.
   The accused man is Albert Duro, 30, who is a member of a Mission
Indian band.
   The victim, Phillip Fernando Brown, was a member of a third
tribe _ the Gila River Indian tribe. The boy was shot to death on
June 15, 1984, on the Salt River reservation near Scottsdale, Ariz.
   Duro originally was charged with murder by the federal
government. But those charges were dismissed.
   The Salt River tribe then accused him of illegally discharging a
gun on its reservation.
   A federal judge threw out the tribe's charge. But the judge was
overruled last year by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which
said the Salt River tribal court has jurisdiction in the case.
   The appeals court noted that in 1984 Duro was living with his
girlfriend on the Salt River reservation and was working for PiCopa
Construction Co., which the tribe owns.
   ``These contacts justify the tribal court's conclusion that Duro
is an Indian subject to its criminal jurisdiction,'' the appeals
court said. ``We stress that this is not purely a racial
determination.''
   ``Extending tribal court criminal jursidiction to non-member
Indians who have significant contacts with a reservation does not
amount to a racial classification,'' the appeals court continued.
We further find that this policy is reasonably related to the
legitimate goal of improving law enforcement on reservations.''
   The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court in 1978 ruled
that an Indian tribe may not prosecute non-Indians for crimes on
the reservation.
   But the 9th Circuit court said that decision left unanswered
whether a tribe would have authority to prosecute a member of
another tribe in such cases.
   The appeals court noted that tribal courts generally handle
petty crimes by Indians against Indians, leaving federal courts to
prosecute major crimes.
   Duro's lawyers said he is living in California and denied
charges by the Salt River tribe that he is a fugitive.
   The case is Duro vs. Reina, 88-6546.

   President Bush today consoled grieving
friends and relatives of the 47 crewmen killed in the USS Iowa
explosion, saluting the sailors as ``America's pride.''
   ``We will not, cannot, as long as we live, know why God has
called them home. But one thing we can be sure, this world is a
more peaceful place because of the USS Iowa,'' Bush said at a
memorial service at the Norfolk Naval Air Station.
   Among the 6,000 people jammed into the hangar for the service
were victims' relatives and scores of sailors and officers in dress
blues. A bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium.
Behind were an American flag and the battleship's banners. Outside,
2,000 listened to the service on loudspeakers.
   The service came a day after the World War II-era battleship
eased into its home port, its gun barrels scorched and its 1,500
crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory
of their dead shipmates.
   The president, himself a World War II Navy pilot, said he was
proud to recommission the Iowa in 1984 and said it had earned 11
battle stars in two wars.
   But with the fire and explosion last week in the battleship's
No. 2 gun turret, he said, ``Fate has written a sorrowful chapter
in the history of this great ship.''
   ``They came from Hidalgo, Texas; Cleveland, Ohio; Tampa, Fla.;
Costa Mesa, California,'' the president said. ``They came to the
Navy as strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends and
left the Navy as brothers in eternity.''
   ``To the Navy community, remember that you have the admiration
of America for sharing the burden of grief as a family,'' Bush said.
   ``You must be heroically strong now. ... To all who mourn a son,
a brother, a husband, a father, a friend, I can only offer you the
gratitude of a nation, for your loved one served his country with
distinction and honor,'' he said.
   He said to the children of the lost crewmen, ``You must never
forget that your father was America's pride.''
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally, commander of the Iowa, said the men who
died ``made the ultimate sacrifice for us. The men of turret two
will be part of the spirit of the Iowa forever.''
   ``We shared the good, the bad, the comedy and now the tragedy,''
Moosally said.
   After the service, the president and his wife, Barbara, moved
through the crowd as the Navy Hymn played, offering words of
consolation, shaking hands and hugging mourners, many of them in
tears. The victims' families then met with the ship's commander
privately.
   On Sunday night, about 3,000 family members and friends greeted
the ship on its arrival at Norfolk Naval Base, exchanging tearful
embraces with loved ones.
   When the 887-foot warship moved into sight of the dock, families
let out scattered cheers. But as tugs pushed the ship into its
berth, the crowd fell silent. All that could be heard were the
cries of gulls that circled the Iowa's wake.
   The barrels of the three-gun turret were in the same position as
when the explosion occurred off Puerto Rico on Wednesday.
   Reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the
crewmen.
   Fifty-eight crewmen were in the turret when it exploded during
gun exercises. Eleven sailors in the lowest level of the turret,
six decks below the guns, survived.
   The Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion,
which damaged only the inside of the turret.
   But Navy teams said it appeared that the blast occurred while
the powder bags were being loaded into the big gun, The New York
Times reported Sunday.
   The Navy on Sunday released a videotape made by an officer on
the bridge who wanted to record the firing of the guns.
   The explosion appears to blast away the gasketlike rubber that
seals the gun slits and is followed by a jet of fire and thick
smoke from the gunhouse.

<HEAD>Court to Judge Validity of Law Allowing Abandoned Rail Line for Nature
Trails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to judge the
validity of a federal law allowing the use of abandoned rail line
rights-of-way for nature trails.
   The court said it will decide in a case from Vermont whether the
law unconstitutionally deprives some property owners of the use of
their land without providing ``just compensation.''
   Vermont Railroad Inc. in 1975 discontinued service over a
1.7-mile stretch of its North Burlington branch rail line in
Chittenden County, Vt.
   Part of the rail line's right-of-way crosses property J. Paul
and Patricia Preseault say they own. Vermont officials say the
state owns the land at issue.
   If the Preseaults do own it, they have the right under state law
to use the property once rail service is discontinued and the
railway's easement automatically discontinued.
   But the National Trails System Act, as amended in 1983, allows
for the maintenance of railroad rights-of-way for possible future
railroad use _ so-called railbanking _ while permitting such
rights-of-way to be used as nature trails.
   Vermont entered into a lease with the city of Burlington under
which the city will maintain the right-of-way as a trail while
preserving it for possible rail use.
   Citing the state-city agreement, the Interstate Commerce
Commission rejected the Preseaults' attempt to have the rail line
declared officially abandoned.
   The Preseaults appealed the commission's action, but the 2nd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected their arguments that the
federal trails act violates the Constitution's Fifth Amendment,
which bars the ``taking'' of private property without just
compensation.
   The justices were told that some 10,000 miles of railroad
right-of-way have been abandoned since 1985.
   The case is Preseault vs. ICC, 88-1076.

   Soldiers wounded 17 Palestinians in the
occupied lands today, hospitals reported, and Arab residents said
Jewish settlers smashed windows in the West Bank city of Hebron
after their buses were stoned by youths.
   An army spokesman confirmed ``a couple of Israelis'' attacked
cars and shops in Hebron after the settlers' buses were pelted by
stones during a visit to a Jewish religious site in the area.
   Arab reporters said windows were smashed in at least 15 cars,
and a Hebron shopkeeper, Marwan Abu Ghalyoun, said six stores in
the city were damaged by settlers.
   ``Some youths stoned the bus, and most of the settlers in the
buses got out carrying clubs and iron bars and started smashing the
cars parked in the street,'' he said. ``I went to one settler and
tried to stop him from smashing my car, but one soldier ordered me
back to my shop so I turned back.''
   An army spokesman, who is not identified under military
regulations, said soldiers tried to break up the confrontation and
were themselves attacked by the Israelis. He said several Israelis
were arrested.
   There were no injuries in the incident, he said, but the army
declared a curfew on the city of 79,000.
   Most of the gunshot wounds reported by Arab hospitals today came
from clashes in five refugee camps in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Six of the injuries came in early morning clashes, and the rest
later in the day, hospital officials and Arab reporters said. The
confrontations with soldiers followed a day of widespread clashes
Sunday in which 53 Palestinians were reported shot and wounded.
   Military officials could not confirm any of the injuries today,
but reported that soldiers killed a Palestinian late Sunday during
a raid on a West Bank village. The army confirmed four of the 53
wounded reported Sunday by Arab hospital officials.
   In Jerusalem, a Cabinet minister from the left-leaning Labor
Party today praised the PLO for blocking efforts by radical
Palestinian factions to further incite last week's rioting in
neighboring Jordan.
   Moshe Shahal, minister for energy, told army radio today that
the PLO blocked the distribution of leaflets aimed at undermining
King Hussein. Eight people were killed in Jordan during four days
of rioting over government price increases.
   Shahal said the action shows the PLO plays a central role in the
occupied lands, and in Jordan and Lebanon, and called on Israel to
formulate a clear response to the aims of the Palestinians.
   His comments reflect a split in Israel's coalition government
over whether to negotiate with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir says Israel will never hold talks
with the PLO but several Labor Party ministers recently have urged
a change in Israel's stand.
   Shamir has called for holding elections in the West Bank and
Gaza to choose Palestinians to negotiate an interim peace treaty
with Israel.
   The PLO reportedly has countered with a proposal for elections
in the occupied lands for members of the Palestine National
Council, the PLO's parliament-in-exile.
   This would amount to indirect recognition of the PLO.
   The army today confirmed the death of 24-year-old Amjad
el-Mamani from the village of Deir Sudan near Ramallah. Arab
reporters said he was killed Sunday night when soldiers fired on
youths throwing stones.
   An army spokesman said: ``There was a search for weapons and
people engaged in terrorism. Three were captured and escaped, and
in the course of recapturing them, one was killed.''
   The death brought to 444 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have been killed.

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas appear not to be
gaining any ground in their siege of Jalalabad, and diplomatic
sources say the insurgents' Pakistani backers had been deeply
divided on whether to mount the offensive.
   The guerrillas battled government forces in four provinces on
Sunday and fired rockets into Kabul, the capital, the government
said. Nearly 280 people were reported killed in the fighting,
including 12 in Kabul, it said.
   The guerrillas, meanwhile, claimed Soviet aircraft were dropping
napalm on insurgent positions and said 300 government troops
defected to the guerrillas on Saturday.
   In neighboring Pakistan, a Foreign Ministry official denied a
report in Sunday's editions of The New York Times that Pakistan
directs the guerrillas' operations and had ordered them to attack
Jalalabad.
   The city is 40 miles west of Pakistan, where most Afghan
guerrillas are based, and 75 miles east of Kabul.
   Pakistan ordered the attack on Jalalabad following a March 5
meeting attended by U.S. Ambassador Robert Oakley, The Times quoted
a Pakistani participant and other officials as saying. Jalalabad
was attacked March 6.
   Oakley's office on Sunday referred all questions to Kent Obee,
chief of the U.S. Information Service in Islamabad. Obee refused
comment.
   ``There is no truth in the report,'' said a senior diplomat in
the Pakistan Foreign Ministry, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``Afghans ... are very independent people. They do not take
orders from anyone regarding their own affairs, much less about the
conduct of fighting in their country,'' the official said.
   But diplomats in Kabul, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
there were deep divisions within Pakistan's military and government
on whether the guerrillas should have tried to take the city, which
government troops have successfully defended.
   The diplomats said up to 8,000 guerrillas have died in the
battle for Jalalabad, compared to 2,000 government soldiers.
   One diplomat termed the offensive a ``suicide mission.'' He said
there were 12,000 guerrillas around the city, compared with 20,000
government soldiers. The Times reported that no Afghans were
present at the March 5 meeting of senior Pakistani military and
civilian officials. Guerrilla sources said Sunday they were unaware
of any such meeting.
   Pakistan is headquarters for a seven-party guerrilla alliance
and its Inter Services Intelligence agency has distributed billions
of dollars in U.S. military aid to the insurgents over the past
decade.
   The guerrillas began fighting after Marxists took control of the
Afghan government in a 1978 coup. Soviets troops intervened a year
later and stayed for nine years to prop up the communists.
   Shortly after Soviet forces completed their withdrawal on Feb.
15, several rebel commanders said Jalalabad would be their first
offensive.
   President Najib of Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan
of violating the U.N.-sponsored accord that led the way for the
Soviet withdrawal.
   Defense Minister Shah Nawaz Tanai, in remarks released Sunday,
said: ``The Pakistani side should keep in mind that its soil will
come to lie under Afghanistan's rocket strikes.''
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said at least 265 people were
killed _ most of them guerrillas _ and 123 injured Sunday in
Jalalabad, Khost, Kandahar and Herat. At least 12 people died in
rocket attacks in northern Kabul, official Radio Kabul reported.
   The claims could not be independently verified.
   Heavy fighting in Jalalabad, Khost and Kandahar also was
reported by the guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency in Islamabad,
Pakistan, although it gave no casualties.
   The agency did claim today that Soviet aircraft were dropping
napalm and other bombs on guerrilla positions in the Afghan
province of Badakshan. It said there were heavy civilian losses.
   Guerrillas previously have reported the use of Soviet and Indian
pilots by Afghanistan. Kabul, Moscow and New Delhi all have denied
the charges.
   The guerrilla leaders also claimed that two regiments comprising
300 men of the Afghan army defected to the guerrillas with a large
quantity of arms in northwestern Badghis province on Saturday.
   The agency also said guerrillas Friday attacked the large Bagram
Afghan air force base, about 30 miles north of Kabul, killing 25
government soldiers.

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 United Mine Workers
blocked two mines and a coal plant today as the union escalated its
3-week-old strike against the Pittston Coal Group. The union also
walked off the job at a second company.
   UMW officials said miners, their spouses and retirees who began
blocking the Pittston mine and plant entrances before dawn would
remain until removed by police.
   ``We're going to let our rear ends touch the asphalt and we're
not going to move,'' said Marty Hudson, executive assistant to UMW
Vice President Cecil Roberts. ``We're going to let the county feed
us awhile.''
   Also today, about 750 miners stopped work at Westmoreland Coal
Co. by opting en masse to take days off allowed in their contract,
the union said.
   UMW District 28 President Jackie Stump said union President
Richard Trumka called the work stoppage at Westmoreland's Virginia
mines, in part because the company is suspected of filling coal
orders for strike-hobbled Pittston.
   Some 1,400 Pittston employees in Virginia and 300 in West
Virginia went on strike April 5, accusing the company of unfair
practices during contract talks. The miners had been working
without a contract since February 1988.
   ``Each and every company is going to be looked at whether or not
they're filling Pittston's orders,'' Stump said. ``If they are, we
consider it to be a conspiracy to break the union.''
   Steve Anderson, spokesman for Westmoreland, said the mass use of
personal days was ``unfortunate.'' He denied Westmoreland was
filling Pittston orders.
   ``We and Pittston are highly, highly competitive with each
other,'' Anderson said. ``It's highly unlikely that Pittston would
ask us to fill their contracts.''
   The union said the stoppage at Westmoreland would last through
Wednesday as each miner takes three personal days off. Under their
contract, each worker gets 10 a year.
   Outside the Pittston plant and mines, many strikers rid
themselves of all forms of identification to prepare for arrest.
   State Police and company guards looked on from across the street.

   Cold-weather records fell this morning along the Atlantic Coast
and in the Ohio Valley. Rain and thunderstorms were scattered
across the country after spawning tornadoes in the Plains and
pelting California and Illinois with hail.
   Eight tornadoes touched down in Kansas and Nebraska on Sunday
afternoon, and storms winds caused some minor damage near McCook,
Neb. There were no reports of injuries.
   Other storms dropped three-quarter inch hail near Dongola, Ill.,
and at Honcut, Calif.
   The storms diminished in strength during the evening.
   By this morning, showers and thunderstorms were continuing in
parts of Texas, South Carolina, Montana, Alabama and northern
California. Rain and occasional thunderstorms were scattered from
central Tennessee across parts of Kentucky, Illinois, Iowa,
Minnesota, Montana and Oregon.
   Snow was scattered over central New Hampshire, but no
significant accumulations were reported.
   Overnight low temperatures dipped to the 20s and 30s, and even
the high teens in places, from the upper Great Lakes and Ohio
Valley to the Atlantic Coast from New Jersey to New England.
   Record low temperature records for the date were set this
morning in Atlantic City, N.J., where it dipped to 26, 8 degrees
below the 1956 recrod; and Youngstown, Ohio, where it was 27, 1
degree under than the 1980 record.
   Temperatures were expected to soar again in Texas and the
Plains, where the nation's hot spot Sunday with a high of 105
degrees was Salina, Kan.
   Today's forecast called for showers and a few thundershowers
from the central Pacific Coast to the northern Rockies, with snow
over higher elevations of Montana. Showers and thunderstorms were
expected to be scattered from the middle Mississippi Valley across
the lower Ohio Valley to the North Carolina coast. Widely scattered
showers and thunderstorms were expected to develop during the
afternoon and evening from west central Texas to the lower Missouri
Valley.

   Only one of four helium balloons in
an 83-year-old distance race founded by an adventure-loving
newspaper publisher remained aloft today, floating over Wyoming 650
miles from the starting point.
   The silvery Jura, piloted by Karl Spenger and Roland Schuler,
was spotted at 11,000 feet at 5:40 a.m., 20 miles from Rock
Springs, Wyo., race spokesman Harlan Jost said.
   Last year's winner, the bright yellow Rosie O'Grady, touched
down at 5 a.m. in Evanston, Wyo., about 600 miles from the starting
point, while the other two entries gave up Sunday afternoon in
California and Arizona, Jost said.
   But Jost said a winner will not be declared until all the
balloons have landed because winds might blow the balloon back
toward Palm Springs.
   The four balloons lifted off into the desert sky at dawn Sunday
in the Gordon Bennett race, founded in 1906 by New York Herald
publisher James Gordon Bennett Jr.
   Competitors dumped sand ballast to reach the 12,000-foot level
and catch easterly winds of 30 mph to 40 mph.
   The race is won by the balloon that travels farthest, regardless
of where it lands. The modern record is 1,346 miles, set in 1981.
   Bennett originated the ``exclusive'' news story, financed Henry
Stanley's expedition to Africa to find David Livingston and backed
an ill-fated Arctic expedition.
   In the early years, the race was held at various places in the
United States and Europe but was suspended at the outbreak of World
War II. It was revived in 1979 and has originated in Palm Springs
since 1984.

   A man who fled an apartment fire that
claimed five lives was arrested after screaming at firefighters to
save people trapped inside, police say.
   One woman, however, credited the man's yells early Saturday
morning with saving her and her family.
   Larry Bishop, 29, was charged with disorderly conduct, which
carries a $50 fine.
   ``He was carrying on, trying to give orders to everybody,'' said
police Capt. Ronald Burch. ``He's not a fireman, nor is he a
policeman.''
   Ruth Farr said Bishop's shouts awakened her and her husband in
time for them and their three children to get out.
   ``He was shouting, `Come on, don't die up there! Come out! Come
out!''' said Ms. Farr. ``He went crazy trying to get people out.
The cops kind of had to wrestle him to the ground, but if it wasn't
for him hollering, we wouldn't have woken up.''
   The three adults and two children killed in the blaze were found
on the second floor of the two-story apartment. Bishop said he had
been asleep on a first-floor couch after attending a party for one
of the women who later died.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.

<HEAD>Eds: Updates 6th graf pvs ``They blame...'' with King Hussein reportedly
accepting prime minister's resignation.</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of burnt cars and shattered
window frames are being cleared from the streets of Jordan's
riot-swept southern towns.
   But people say the anger that brought four days of violence last
week because of government-imposed austerity measures will not
disappear so easily.
   Jordan has in recent years escaped most of the Middle East's
turmoil so last week's outbreak of discontent came as a shock.
   ``The rioters want things to get better in Jordan,'' said a
25-year-old man from the city of Kerak who said he was among the
stone-throwers who attacked government buildings and banks.
   Residents interviewed during a two-day tour of the south said
they want a rollback on the price increases that set off the riots,
a new government and an investigation into corruption.
   They blame Prime Minister Zaid Rifai for the economic crisis and
have called for his ouster. Sources said Rifai offered to step down
and King Hussein today accepted his resignation. There was no
official announcement.
   The riots, in which least eight people were killed, started in
Maan. The city's downtown area is now a blight of twisted
electricity pylons, severed tree limbs and burnt rubber tires.
   Soldiers in armored personnel carriers enforce the calm. There
have been no recent confrontations and a 24-hour curfew has been
eased to allow people to buy food.
   But authorities are still cautious.
   Vehicles passing on the main north-south Desert Highway are all
flagged down, and a reporter who turned off the road was escorted
back.
   Elsewhere in the region, soldiers riding jeeps mounted with
machine guns patrol the streets of the larger towns.
   Government institutions at even the smallest crossroads were not
spared in the outbreak of violence. The eight-room schoolhouse in
the hamlet of Athween was sacked, its little desks spread out in
the dirt courtyard outside.
   In Buysara, a burned Toyota Land Cruiser and dirt roadblocks
marked the village entrance.
   The roads around the town of Shobak were studded by uprooted
roadsigns and boulders rolled into place by protesters.
   Residents of Shobak said they were particularly angered when
local press reports passed off the first riots, in Maan on Tuesday,
with a one-sentence reference to a demonstration by taxi drivers
against the 25 percent increase in the price of gasoline.
   ``The government first said it was just the drivers' problem.
The drivers' problem is one out of 100,'' said Ibrahim, a
government employee who did not want to use his family name.
   The government raised prices between 10 percent and 50 percent
on cigarettes, gasoline and other commodities as part of an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund to help reschedule
Jordan's $6 billion foreign debt.
   Shobak residents said the riot started with three or four
villagers on the main street denouncing the price increases. The
three or four swelled to three or four hundred, and the anger
mounted.
   Town headman Hussein Tayat expressed the citizens' feelings this
way: ``They (the government) are thieves.''
   In the town of about 14,000, at least 40 percent of the people
are without a regular source of income, he said, adding: ``How can
they live?''
   Young men gathered behind the headman chimed in as he talked.
   ``Put the embezzlers before the judge.''
   ``Bring the money back from Geneva.''
   ``We are not against the king, just the corrupt policies.''
   Said Ibrahim: ``We had so much money coming into the country,
where did it go?''
   Residents discount charges that the riots were fomented by
underground opposition to the government.
   ``The beginning of the riots were from the people, not political
movements,'' said the Kerak resident.
   There was no need to organize, said a telephone clerk in
Buysara. ``The prices went up in all places.''
   He said government employees living on an average of 100 dinars
($185) a month were painfully aware of each price increase.
   The rioters are a little ashamed of the damage, but as the Kerak
man put it, it was necessary ``to scold the government.''
   Elsewhere in Jordan, shock was mixed with support.
   ``It's strange for Jordan, it's a small country, it's all one
family,'' said Abdul Razak Tubeshat, mayor of the northern town of
Irbid. ``We discuss, we don't destroy.''
   But an Amman man who would not give his name enumerated his
grievances at living on 80 dinars ($148) a month.
   ``I feel like rioting,'' he said.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The health of former Communist Party
leader Janos Kadar has worsened, the foreign minister said Monday,
without disclosing the nature of the ailment.
   Kadar, 76, was replaced as party leader by Karoly Grosz in May
1988 after 32 years in power. Kadar was given the honorary post of
party president.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said on Hungarian state radio that
Kadar's ``physical and mental state of health had worsened.'' He
was quoted as saying the ailment was ``an irreversible process.''
   On Saturday, Minister of State Rezsoe Nyers said Kadar was not
able to perform his functions in the honorary post.
   He said his appearance at a recent Central Committee session may
have been Kadar's ``last such appearance,'' according to the news
agency MTI and state TV.
   Kadar has come increasingly under criticism for halting
Hungary's reforms in the 1970s and for his role in the 1968 Warsaw
Pact invasion that crushed Czechoslovakia's ``Prague Spring''
reforms.

   British Gen. Sir Patrick Palmer became
the 15th commander of NATO's northern flank Monday with military
pomp and under heavy security.
   Palmer, 55, took command of the six-nation Allied Forces
Northern Europe headquarters, which oversees land and sea defense
of Norway, Denmark and northern Germany. It is the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's second-largest but most sparsely populated
region.
   NATO Supreme Commander U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin said he was
encouraged by recent Soviet statements, but wanted to see signs of
sincerity.
   ``They have offered to reduce their conventional arms by 10
percent ... but what is 10 percent when they have a 300 percent
superiority? Let's see if they are serious about reducing their
conventional arms before we discuss (NATO) nuclear arms,'' he said.
   Galvin ruled out any NATO investigation into the accident
involving a Soviet nuclear submarine that caught fire and sank 310
miles west of Norway's coast on April 7, killing 42 sailors. ``We
will do nothing with that submarine unless the Soviets ask us for
something,'' he said.
   Palmer replaces retiring commander, Gen. Sir Geoffrey Howlett.

<HEAD>EDS: Inserts 4 grafs from Q&amp;A after 16th graf pvs, Quayle said</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice president Dan Quayle, leaving on a whirlwind
trip to Australia and Southeast Asia, said today the United States
intends to remain a Pacific power despite arguments by
``declinists'' that the nation ``must pull back from our global
commitments.''
   Rather, he told the annual meeting of The Associated Press, the
challenge for the United States is to advance ``our strategic and
economic interest in Asia while maintaining our continuing
commitments to Europe.''
   He said that in the United States and its Pacific allies, there
is an undercurrent of gloominess, with some observers _ he did not
name any _ predicting a grim future for the United States.
   ``The United States, they say, is a nation in decline. The
budget deficit and the trade deficit are symptoms of a deeper
malaise. ... If we are to avoid disaster, we must pull back from
our global commitments.
   ``In a nutshell, this ... is the argument of the so-called
`declinists.'''
   So, Quayle said, an important purpose of his 12-day trip ``is to
address these concerns head-on. I will be reminding our Asian
friends that the current wave of declinist thought in the United
States is hardly a new phenomenon.''
   Yet, Quayle said, when Americans express doubt about the health
of the American society, ``it's usually a sign of renewal, not of
decline.'' By recognizing the country's problems, the United States
is spurred to take remedial action, he said.
   As for defense, Quayle said the United States will continue to
``pursue a vigorous security role in Asia.''
   He said the Soviet Union, recognizing the failure of its
economic system, is looking toward Asia. Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev is due to visit China next month for the first
Sino-Soviet summit meeting in 20 years.
   ``We recognize the Soviet interest in sharing in Asia's economic
boom and in increasing its access to the region. But Moscow has a
long way to go to achieve this goal,'' he said.
   He said Moscow continues to modernize its military force
capabilities in Asia and the Pacific, where the largest of the
Soviet fleets remains stationed.
   With the emergence of Asian nations, Quayle said, the challenge
to the United States is to advance ``our strategic and economic
interests in Asia while maintaining our continuing commitments to
Europe.''
   He said, ``I'm going to the Pacific because the United States is
a great power, because the United States is a Pacific power and
because we intend to play an important role in the Pacific.''
   He told the AP meeting that, ``like the president, I recognize
that our future, and the future of the Pacific rim nations, are
closely entwined. That is why the United States is focusing on the
region as never before.''
   He noted that the Asian nations have thriving free enterprise
economies, with the members of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations making up what would be the United States' seventh largest
trading partner.
   Quayle said the United States will engage in bilateral efforts
necessary for opening foreign markets to U.S. goods and services.
Open and free trade are the hallmark of a U.S. policy needed to
``promote our competitiveness and the welfare of the American
people,'' he said.
   Answering questions after his speech, Quayle said his biggest
surprise since taking office was how much he enjoys overseas travel.
   The vice president, who visited Central and South America soon
after he was inaugurated, said most of his trips as senator had
been back home to Indiana.
   He also said he had been in daily close contact with President
Bush. ``I see how he formulates his policies,'' Quayle said. ``I'm
there to give my opinion.''
   And, asked if embattled House Speaker Jim Wright should step
down while fighting ethics charges, Quayle answered, ``Jim Wright
will make that decision.''
   On his trip to Asia, Quayle will mix substantive policy
discussions, particularly dealing with trade and defense, with
ceremonial duties and tourism.
   Flying to Asia, he wil pay a courtesy call on former President
Reagan in Los Angeles. On the return trip, the vice president plans
to tour Alaska's wildlife-rich Prince William Sound to see for
himself the cleanup efforts following the Exxon Valdez oil spill.
   Besides Australia, Quayle will visit Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand.
   Quayle, accompanied by his wife, Marilyn, will spend five days
in Australia representing President Bush at this year's celebration
of Australian-American Friendship Week.
   In talks with Australian officials in Canberra, the vice
president will explore bilateral issues such as trade, defense and
space cooperation, aide David Beckwith said. said. As chairman of
the National Space Council, Quayle is charged with promoting
advancement of the U.S. space program.
   The Quayles will also do some sightseeing, visiting the Great
Barrier Reef, the coral reefs that abound with marine life off
Australia's northeast corner. The site is one of the country's most
popular tourist attractions.
   The visit to Jakarta, Indonesia, is mostly a chance for Quayle
to get acquainted with the heavily populated island nation, which,
like Singapore and Thailand, is a member of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, Beckwith said.
   Trade issues are at the top of Quayle's list in talking with
leaders of the ASEAN nations, Beckwith said. In the past, the
United States has urged Asian nations to end the high tariffs and
import restrictions that stifle free trade.
   The vice president also plans to meet with Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, Cambodia's former head of state and leader of one of four
factions vying for power in that country, in his 1{ days in Jakarta.
   Indeed, a key theme on Quayle's agenda is Cambodia, a
war-ravaged country whose future remains uncertain. The United
States is weighing whether to provide military assistance to
non-communist factions after Vietnam ends its 10-year occupation of
the country this fall.
   ``We're talking Cambodia heavily in Thailand and to some extent
in all the countries because if there is any policy development
it's going to be in the Cambodia position because it's wide open
now,'' Beckwith said.
   In Thailand, the vice president will tour a Cambodian refugee
camp populated by people who fled their country, some during the
brutal Khmer Rouge regime between 1975-1978.
   Earlier this year, Quayle, a former Indiana senator, visited
several countries in Latin and Central America on his first foreign
mission.

<TEXT>
   Richard M. Daley took the oath of office as mayor
on his 47th birthday today, assuming the job his political-boss
father held for 21 years but promising to bring his own, more open
style to City Hall.
   ``I call on each and every Chicagoan to share their ideas and
enthusiasm as we work together to move this city forward,'' said
Daley, whose victory over two black politicians split the
electorate sharply along racial lines.
   With Daley's inauguration, Chicago becomes the largest U.S. city
in which voters have replaced a black mayor with a white.
   Daley was sworn in by Senior U.S. District Judge Abraham Lincoln
Marovitz, who performed the same service for the late Richard J.
Daley six times.
   The younger Daley campaigned on a promise to operate a more
accessible government in the nation's third-largest city than did
his father, who as mayor ran a political machine powered by
Democratic patronage. He died in 1976.
   ``You don't hand down policies from generation to generation,''
the younger Daley said, ``but you do hand down values.'' He said
his father had instilled in him ``a love for this city and a zest
for public service.''
   The late-morning swearing-in was designed to pull together the
disparate groups the new mayor seeks to unite, his press secretary
said.
   ``We tried to include people from all ethnic stripes,'' said
Avis LaVelle.
   Daley, who is leaving a job as Cook County prosecutor, was
elected April 4 to complete the last two years of the second term
of the late Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor. Daley
succeeds Eugene Sawyer, named acting mayor by the City Council
following Washington's death 17 months ago.
   Daley defeated Sawyer in the Democratic primary Feb. 28 and then
beat black third-party candidate Timothy Evans and Edward Vrdolyak,
a former Democratic leader who switched to the GOP.
   At today's ceremony, Sawyer congratulated Daley and offered a
suggestion: ``One thing that Chicago needs more than anything else,
and that is your strong, aggressive leadership to make this one
city, one people, working together.''
   Paul Green, a political science professor at Governors State
University, said that because of patronage-limiting court
decisions, the younger Daley would not be able to run things as his
father did, even if he wanted.
   ``He's not going back to the golden era of the machine, because
that era and the machine are dead,'' Green said.
   The vote for Daley was largely split along racial lines, with
some blacks warning that Daley would revive machine politics. But
Daley consistently pledged that his government will be open.

   Police on Monday seized about 300 knives, iron
bars and other homemade weapons in a search of a Vietnamese refugee
camp that followed violent clashes among boat people, police said.
   The search was ordered after a gang attacked a Vietnamese man
with knives in the Shamshiupo camp, which houses about 5,000
refugees, police said. The victim suffered head injuries, they said.
   Two Vietnamese were detained for questioning in the incident,
police said.
   The violence at the Shamshuipo camp occurred only one day after
an 18-year-old Vietnamese was killed and two others injured in a
clash at the Tuen Mun camp, home to about 3,000 boat people.
   About 27,000 Vietnamese boat people are in Hong Kong, and about
half live in closed camps, which they are not allowed to leave. The
closed camp policy was introduced by the Hong Kong government in
1982 to deter the influx of Vietnamese refugees.

   Four people stormed a hospital room
Monday and freed a prisoner facing the death sentence for killing a
policeman, a news agency reported.
   Abdulkadir Konuk had been brought to the Istanbul hospital for a
checkup from a prison in the western city of Canakkale, the
Anatolia news agency said.
   The gang burst into the hospital, sprayed tear gas at four
soldiers guarding the room in Capa University Hospital and fled
with Konuk, taking a nurse as hostage. The nurse later was
released, the report said.
   Konuk, 42, was a member of the outlawed leftist Halkin Kurtulusu
group. In 1983 he was convicted of killing a police officer and
sentenced to death by a Izmir court.
   There are 227 people are on death row in Turkey but Parliament
has held back from approving execution in any of the cases.

   Firefighters in sweltering Colorado mopped up hot
spots today after a weekend of wildfires, but one blaze continued
to burn out of control.
   Denver hit a record high Sunday of 85 degrees, and the heat,
coupled with strong wind and low humidity, heightened the danger of
fire, officials said.
   The Forest Service on Sunday banned campfires on 2.1 million
acres of the two national forests on the Front Range south of
Denver.
   ``It's just extremely dry,'' said Charlie Knight, a Forest
Service fire information officer. ``Until we get some rain, people
have just got to be careful or we're going to have a tragedy _
either loss of life or loss of structures.''
   Since Friday, six brush or forest fires broke out from Pikes
Peak west of Colorado Springs to Boulder County northwest of Denver.
   Five fires were reported contained or nearly contained Sunday
and had caused no injuries or damage to buildings. The largest
blaze was an 872-acre forest fire near Monument. ``There is not
even a wisp of smoke coming up now,'' Knight said.
   However, a blaze that charred some 50 acres near Morrison
continued to burn out of control today, Knight said. The Jefferson
County Sheriff's Department said visitors to nearby Mount Falcon
State Park were asked to leave.
   Authorities said that a 600-acre brush fire in Denver may have
been set and that the other blazes may have been caused by humans
unintentionally.

   A British tourist fell to his death after he
illegally climbed the Great Pyramid, then dozed off, authorities
said Monday.
   Peter Harold Flanagan apparently climbed the 482-foot pyramid
Saturday night, a British Embassy spokesman said. His body was
found Sunday beside the monument, the largest of the three Giza
pyramids, said John Hillman, an embassy official.
   An officer at Giza police station said Flanagan apparently was
alone on his climb and that foul play was not suspected. He did not
explain how authorities knew Flanagan, 21, fell asleep before
toppling to his death.
   Pyramid climbing has been done for centuries. Records show more
than 1,600 climbers have died in the past 200 years, and at least
200 of them in the last 50 years.
   The last reported death was in 1980 when Susanne Urban, a
21-year-old American, was killed in a fall.
   Pyramid climbing was banned in 1951 but enforcement has been lax.

200 chefs.
   ``We have everyone from top executives to people on public

   Sunday's all-you-can-eat, $40-a-head meal by the Gourmet Gents

   In the past 10 years, the ``gents'' have raised more than
$250,000 to help the children's art program. Sunday's benefit
raised about $30,000.
   Since its founding in 1969 by the Museum of Modern Art, the

creative writing, photography, film-making and other arts in Harlem.

   A 14-ton log from a tree that started growing
more than 700 years ago is being hauled across the country and back
to call attention to the plight of the nation's old-growth forests.
   The Ancient Forest Rescue Expedition set out Saturday with the
731-year-old Douglas fir log on a month-long journey to Washington,
D.C., and then back to Portland, Ore., by May 19.
   Rick Bailey of Joseph, Ore., who will do most of the driving,
said he hopes the log will inspire people to pressure political
leaders into protecting old-growth forest. He said less than 10
percent of Oregon's old-growth timber remains.
   ``This thing was growing there in the forest before Marco Polo
set sail for China,'' said expedition organizer Mitch Friedham of
Bellingham, Wash.
   The 20-foot log, more than seven feet wide, was legally cut on
U.S. Forest Service property on the Olympic Peninsula.
Environmentalists later bought it for $3,950.

   New flooding in northern Malawi
destroyed the homes of tens of thousands of people, washed away
crops and drowned livestock, the government said Monday.
   About 200,000 people are homeless following storms since January
in this nation in southern Africa, according to the Disaster
Preparedness Committee.
   In one northern district, people took refuge on makeshift
platforms built on roofs of their flooded houses.
   Government officials and international aid agency
representatives visited the worst-hit province of Karonga, which
borders Tanzania.
   Torrential rains in January and Februrary left 115,000 people
homeless, mainly in southern provinces, the government said. At
that time, flooding destroyed crops, roads, bridges and rail lines,
and the government appealed for $28 million in foreign aid for
emergency repairs and food.

   And of course I think of the man I served for eight years,
Ronald Reagan _ his commitment to his beliefs, his great faith in
the American people _ and the unshakable optimism he brought to the
job.
   The opportunities open to us today were made possible by the
peace and prosperity Ronald Reagan left as his legacy.
   We used to hear a lot about the presidency being too big for one
man.
   That talk stopped with Ronald Reagan.
   Different men, different methods, different circumstances: proof
_ as I see it _ that the presidency is ample enough to accommodate
the strengths and styles of our nation's rich political history.
   In the past three months, these thoughts have framed my own
approach, in dealing with the pressing problems that confront us _
some of them decades in the making _ and in working to put the
United States on a steady course for the decade ahead and the new
century beyond it.
   The first step in every initiative I've undertaken is to square
our actions with enduring American principles.
   Whatever the problem, we can count on public support _ so long
as our policy and principles share a common root.
   Those principles are:
   Freedom: for individuals; for nations, self-determination and
democracy.
   Fairness: equal standards, equal opportunity _ a chance for each
of us to achieve, and make our way, on our own merits.
   Strength: in international affairs, strength our allies can
count on, and our adversaries must respect. And at home, strength
and a sense of self-confidence in carrying forward our nation's
work.
   Excellence: as the underlying goal in the collective efforts we
undertake, and accountability for the work we do. And in the
workings of government, a firm sense of the responsibilities and
powers of government _ and the private sphere that lies beyond its
limits.
   My starting point has been a respect for American institutions _
for Congress, for the dedicated civil servants of the executive
branch, for state and local governments, for the concept of public
service _ and a firm belief in the powers of the presidency.
   Each has its role, each can be enlisted in the work at hand.
   The emphasis is on cooperation _ not confrontation _ as the
surest route to progress.
   I've read more than a few news stories _ before and after the
election _ that said the president and the Congress wouldn't be
able to work together _ that the ``bitter campaign'' had made
cooperation impossible.
   I didn't believe that then _ and we're proving it wrong now.
   When I took office, I told the Congress that the American people
hadn't sent us to Washington to bicker.
   They sent us to govern _ to work together to solve the urgent
problems that confront us, and to shape the long-term strategies to
ensure peace and prosperity in the future.

   A man was convicted today of murdering five
people during a 1987 supermarket hold-up by two gunmen who police
say posed as a cleaning crew to get in after hours.
   Donnie Blankenship, 27, was found guilty of five counts of
second-degree murder, robbery, unlawful use of a weapon and
receiving stolen property. He could receive up to 30 years in
prison on each murder charge.
   The jury, which began deliberating on Saturday, refused to
convict him of first-degree murder, which carries a possible death
penalty.
   Six store employees and a security guard were shot as they lay
on the floor during the robbery. Two of the employees who had been
left for dead survived and testified.
   In September, Marvin Jennings, 27, of Overland, was convicted in
the slayings and was sentenced to five consecutive life terms
without parole for first-degree murder. Prosecutors had sought the
death penalty.
   In his closing arguments, special prosecutor Garrett L. Randall
called Blankenship a ``cold-blooded killer.''

<HEAD>West German Officials Meet With Baker, Cheney and Scowcroft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Eds: Top 13 grafs new with West German officials meeting stiff
resistance; picks up 10th graf pvs, The diplomatic sources. ^By SUSANNE
M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two top West German officials ran into stiff
U.S. resistance today as they met with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to press for an early
round of negotiations with the Soviet Union aimed at reducing
short-range nuclear missiles.
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg held hurriedly arranged talks at the State
Department on the touchy issue of NATO missile deployment.
   As they met, Margaret Tutwiler, the department spokeswoman,
quoted Baker as saying ``it would be a mistake'' to hold such
negotiations and that he thought the problem should be worked out
with the West Germans before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
summit meeting in Brussels at the end of May.
   President Bush, who will meet in the Belgian capital with the
Western leaders, said he had appealed to West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl ``that we keep NATO together, that we stay together,''
   Bush, who was traveling outside Washington, said Kohl, who has
sought a delay in modernizing the U.S.-built Lance missiles,
``knows my view that there must not be any unilateal fait accompli
here.''
   The president's national security assistant, Brent Scowcroft,
attended the talks Baker and Cheney held with the two West German
ministers. Bush spoke with Kohl by telephone last Friday.
   The United States and Britain are concerned that negotiating the
missiles issue with the Soviets could lead to stripping the NATO
allies of their ground-based nuclear weaponry, leaving them at the
mercy of stronger Warsaw Pact conventional forces.
   Baker was expected to underscore this position to the West
Germans, while British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will fly to
Bonn on Sunday to try to dissuade Kohl.
   The idea of holding talks on the missiles has gained favor
recently in West Germany, where the government coalition headed by
Kohl is facing an erosion of popularity and is under extreme
pressure to push for the talks.
   The missiles are a subject of irritation in West Germany.
Because of their short range, the nuclear-tipped missiles are
designed to be used almost exclusively on West German territory.
   Also, the German public has been expressing waning interest in
deploying a new generation of missiles while Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev has been cutting back his forces in Eastern Europe.
   Diplomatic sources told The Associated Press that the German
officials had requested a meeting with Bush because of the
importance of their mission.
   Bush, however, went today to Norfolk, Va., for the USS Iowa
memorial service. So a quickly arranged luncheon with the secretary
of state was sought instead.
   The diplomatic sources, who asked not to be identified by name,
said the request for the meetings was made on Friday. The
announcement that the meeting had been scheduled came just a few
hours later.
   The request came one day after North Atlantic Treaty
Organization defense ministers in Brussels ended a two-day session
by sidestepping the short-range missile quandary.
   The United States and Britain argued in favor of producing and
deploying a more modern version of the missile, while the several
European nations pressed for early negotiations with the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   Kohl wants NATO to postpone a decision on modernizing the
missiles until after his country's national elections in December
1990.
   U.S. officials agreed to delay such a decision, but want to move
forward on research and development of the newer version.
   Officials on both sides of the Atlantic are expressing fears
that the alliance will not be able to forge a common approach on
the matter prior to the summit of NATO leaders scheduled to be held
in May.
   A clash over the issue is expected to come to a head soon,
because few want a crisis to mar President Bush's debut session
with the leaders of the alliance, which is also celebrating its
40th anniversary this year.
   The May 29-30 session in Brussels is designed to forge a
blueprint for the 16-nation pact's future arms control strategy.
   The missile decision is also an issue of vital domestic
political importance to the Kohl government.
   The State Department meeting comes in the wake of talks held
among the leaders of the West German government's governing
coalition parties. At that meeting, the leaders of Bavaria's
conservative Christian Social Union Party agreed to drop their
longstanding opposition to early talks on the missiles.
   The group also supported Kohl's view that the West German
government need not decide on the deployment of the modernized
weapons until 1991 or 1992.
   Kohl's Christian Democratic Union has suffered badly in recent
local elections and has been trailing the left-leaning Social
Democrats since the first of the year in nationwide polls.

<TEXT>
   I think the work we've done these past three months demonstrates
the value of tough, principled negotiations between this
administration and the Congress.
   The bipartsian budget agreement we worked out 10 days ago is a
key example.
   That agreement _ ahead of schedule, on target with Gramm-Rudman,
and with my ``no new taxes'' pledge intact _ is a strong first step
towards dealing with the deficit problem, and keeping our economy _
76 straight months of expanding, uninterrupted growth _ on track.
   Difficult decisions lie ahead, but an important agreement has
been achieved.
   And of course, there is the accord we reached on Central America.
   The people of Nicaragua _ like their neighbors in the region,
like people everywhere _ deserve to live in peace, with freedom.
   The United States is now speaking with one voice _ and standing
behind a plan that will put the Sandinistas to the test.
   And this unity has encouraged leaders like President Arias to
give strong support to U.S. policy.
   And in three short months, we've made a good start coming to
grips with issues demanding urgent attention _ and decisive action.
   And we've taken that action: Action to stabilize the troubled
savings and loan system.
   The reform plan I sent to Congress will restore stability, and
put the S&amp;L system back on its feet, in sound fiscal order.
   My plan guarantees that depositors will be fully protected.
   The S&amp;L system must be reformed, so that the questionable
practices and outright illegalities that caused the crisis will not
happen again _ and those S&amp;L officials found guilty of criminal
actions will be punished for the losses they have caused.
   Last week, the Senate passed my plan, 91 to 8.
   I urge the House to act promptly, and pass this S&amp;L reform bill
with its central provisions intact.
   Action to strengthen ethics in government. The ethics reforms
I've sent to Capitol Hill this month will uphold honesty and
integrity in government service _ and apply an even-handed ethics
standard across all branches of government.
   Action in the war on drugs, where we're advancing on all fronts
_ education, treatment, interdiction and tougher law enforcement.
   The anti-drug effort will receive almost $1 billion in
additional funding in 1990 _ a 21 percent increase in outlays over
what we'll spend in 1989.
   We've imposed a temporary ban on the import of certain
semiautomatic rifles, weapons all too often used in drug-related
killings.
   And we're tackling the drug epidemic in the District of
Columbia, a test case for a full range of innovative anti-drug
measures.
   Of course, dealing with problems that demand immediate attention
is only part of the picture.
   We need to look to the long term, as well _ to focus now on the
kind of future we want to see for ourselves and our nation.
   Investing in that future is high on our national agenda.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   ALAR
   
   The court refused to revive a lawsuit by consumer activist Ralph
Nader, environmentalists and others seeking a government ban on the
chemical Alar.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit.
   Alar, sold by Uniroyal Chemical Co., is used primarily to
enhance the color and uniform ripening of apples.
   Some studies have shown it can cause cancer in animals, and may
be a serious health risk to humans, particularly children.
   But the Environmental Protection Agency on Jan. 6, 1987,
rejected a plea by environmentalists and others to ban Alar. The
agency said it lacked sufficient evidence to order it off the
market.
   The case is Nader vs. EPA, 88-1146.
   
   MARCOS
   
   The court turned away an appeal by deposed Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, aimed at overturning a court
order freezing their assets.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that, in effect,
requires the Marcoses to defend themselves in a lawsuit filed by
the Philippine government. The lower court order also bars them
from transferring most of their alleged vast wealth.
   The case is Marcos vs. Philippines, 88-1431.
   
   KANSAS CITY DESEGREGATION
   
   The court agreed to review a judge's order raising property
taxes to help pay for racially desegregating public schools in
Kansas City, Mo.
   The justices said they will hear arguments that the judge
overstepped his authority when imposing the tax hike for all
property within the city's school district.
   The cases are Missouri vs. Jenkins, 88-1150; Clark vs. Jenkins,
88-1194; and Jackson County vs. Jenkins, 88-1228.
   
   PESTICIDE
   
   The court let stand a ruling that a federal judge may overrule
federal environmental officials and permit use of an allegedly
dangerous pesticide.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by
environmentalists and organized labor in a case, involving the
pesticide dinoseb, of particular importance to farmers in Idaho,
Oregon and Washington state.
   The case is AFL-CIO vs. Love, 88-1255.
   
   PHONES
   
   The court left intact a $101 million refund the nation's
telephone companies were ordered to pay customers for excessive
charges in 1978.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the Federal
Communications Commission overstepped its authority in ordering the
refunds.
   The cases are Southern Bell vs. FCC, 88-1249, and New England
Telephone vs. FCC, 88-1250.
   
   UTILITY DEPOSITS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether the government may tax as
income the deposits that utility companies demand from customers to
ensure payment of future bills.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal in a
case involving an Indiana electric utility.
   The case is Commissioner of IRS vs. Indianapolis Power, 88-1319.
   
   INDIANS
   
   The court agreed to decide whether an Indian tribe can prosecute
members of other tribes for crimes on its reservation.
   The court said it will review a ruling that gives the Salt River
Pima-Maricopa Community in Arizona authority to prosecute a
California man accused in the fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy.
   The case is Duro vs. Reina, 88-6546.
   
   ABANDONED RAIL LINES
   
   The court agreed to judge the validity of a federal law allowing
the use of abandoned rail line rights-of-way for nature trails.
   The court said it will decide in a case from Vermont whether the
law unconstitutionally deprives some property owners of the use of
their land without providing ``just compensation.''
   The case is Preseault vs. ICC, 88-1076.

   First and foremost, that means improving education.
   Investing in the rising generation is long-range planning at its
best.
   Our future in this technological age depends upon the qualities
and capabilities of the American worker _ and not just the most
talented among us, but each individual member of the work force.
   The seven-point program of education reform I sent to Congress
early this month will help us reward excellence, reach out to
students most in need, increase choice, and introduce a healthy
element of competition and accountability that will promote quality
in our schools.
   Preparing for the kinder, gentler future I've spoken of means
helping Americans cope with the changing nature of society _
helping fundamental institutions like the family remain strong and
prosper.
   That's the guiding aim of my child care intitatives, a tax
credit proposal designed to expand the options of low-income
families _ keeping the ultimate choice of who will care for their
children in their hands.
   Preparing for the future means protecting our environment.
   Teddy Roosevelt put it best when he said: ``I do not recognize
the right ... to rob, by wasteful use, the generations that come
after us.''
   Roosevelt spoke those words almost 80 years ago.
   Now, little more than a decade away from the 21st century,
safeguarding our environment is a national _ and international _
imperative.
   We've taken the first, important steps: we've urged Congress to
enact legislation enabling us to ban export of hazardous wastes to
nations where safe handling of those dangerous substances cannot be
guaranteed.
   And in response to growing concern about global warming, the
U.S. will work in concert with other nations to end the discharge
of CFCs into the atmosphere by the year 2000.
   And in the case of the Alaskan oil spill, we have taken steps to
ensure a strong federal role in oversight of the cleanup effort,
and to explore ways to prevent such spills in the future.
   Finally, we have launched an initiative to strengthen the
international strategy on Third World debt, which has already
received broad international support from both industrialized and
developing countries.
   We have set our course with this policy; now I want to see
success on a case by case basis.
   I want to see an agreement with Mexico, with Venezuela, and with
other countries as well.
   We have examined and I have made decisions on U.S. strategy for
Afghanistan, Poland, Central America and other problems and
opportunities needing prompt attention.
   Within a few weeks nearly all of the far-reaching and systematic
defense and foreign policy reviews will be complete.
   I have already made some decisions.
   Others, including on arms control, will be forthcoming soon.
   We are mapping strategies for a period of remarkable change in
international affairs _ change more wide-ranging and rapid than at
any time in the postwar period.
   While we will lead, we also intend to consult and listen _ to
our friends abroad and to the Congress.
   I've met with the leaders of 34 nations _ renewing my
acquaintance with many of them, establishing a working relationship
with the others.
   My secretary of state, Jim Baker, has met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Shevardnadze, and will meet again next month in Moscow to
continue that dialogue.
   And, as with the bipartisan agreement on Nicaragua, I will work
closely on international matters with the Congress.
   Last Monday, we announced a new policy towards Poland, in
recognition of the positive changes taking place there.
   We'll be watching events in Poland closely: the fate of
Solidarity, the follow-through on the free elections promised by
the Polish government.
   Freedom is proving a powerful force in world affairs _ a force
for peace and stability.

   President Bush said Monday he has
not talked with anyone about whether he would pardon fired White
House aide Oliver North and that any suggestions about what he'll
do are ``stupid'' and ``idiotic''
   Bush said he has not had any conversations, direct or indirect,
about whether he would pardon North, who is awaiting a verdict from
jurors on charges stemming from the diversion of Iran arms sales
profits to the icaraguan Contras.
   The president made the comments in a question-and-answer session
with five reporters accompanying him on a flight from Norfolk, Va.
to Chicago.
   In the past, Bush has called North a hero and said he hoped
North would be acquitted.
   He was asked about a report in Newsweek magazine quoting sources
close to him as predicting he would never pardon North, onetime
aide on the National Security Council in Ronald Reagan's White
House.
   ``That's interesting speculation,'' Bush said. ``It shows how
stupid some reports are because that matter has never been
discussed with me by anybody, including my wife.
   ``It shows you how idiotic speculation is. If it was given any
credence as having come from me or as if somebody had discussed it
with me, they simply haven't,'' he said.
   Told that the report quoted sources as merely predicting what
Bush would do, he said, ``Oh well, that's a different story.
   ``I haven't discussed it nor shared my thoughts with anybody. I
don't have any thoughts until I get the facts,'' Bush said.
   A reporter suggested that as a practical matter, the president
might be reluctant to get involved while the legal process was
going forward.
   ``That's got it. You've got it,'' he said.
   Asked if he would talk about the matter after a verdict, Bush
said ``Maybe ... when everything's over.''

   A woman who says drinking during pregnancy caused
birth defects in her son is suing the makers of Jim Beam bourbon
for not putting warning labels on its bottles.
   Jury selection in the lawsuit filed by Candace and Harold Thorp
began today in federal court.
   The couple's 4-year-old son, Michael, was born mentally
retarded, neurologically impaired, developmentally stunted, with
facial and other body malformations, according to the lawsuit.
   The Thorps sued the James B. Beam Distillery Co. of Deerfield,
Ill., claiming it should have provided labels warning that alcohol
can cause birth defects.
   Twenty-nine potential jurors were called today. By late morning,
at least five had been dismissed, including two men who described
themselves as former alcoholics and a woman who said she had been a
bartender for many years.
   Mrs. Thorp said in court documents she drank up to a half a
fifth per day of Jim Beam bourbon while she was pregnant and didn't
know her drinking would damage her child.
   Attorneys for the company said ``Beam does not concede that
maternal alcohol consumption causes birth defects, or that Michael
Thorpe's alleged birth defects were caused by alcohol.''
   The company also asserted in court papers that Washington state
law governing product liability does not require manufacturers to
issue warnings of risks that are considered ``generally known'' by
the community.
   ``Beam had no duty to warn Candace Thorp that drinking during
pregnancy might injure her unborn child,'' the defense attorneys
stated.
   A federal law effective in November will require labels on all
beer, wine or hard liquor that alcohol can cause health problems
and birth defects.
   An estimated 30,000 children are born each year nationwide with
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, according to a 1982 study by researchers at
the University of Washington's Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute.

<HEAD>Famed Conductor Resigns From Berlin Philharmonic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herbert von Karajan, the renowned
conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic for 35 years, announced Monday
he was resigning because of failing health.
   In a letter to West Berlin authorities, the 81-year-old maestro
said his medical problems ``make it impossible for me to fulfill my
obligations'' and complained that Berlin officials had failed to
make clear what they expected of him.
   Berlin's cultural affairs senator, Anke Martiny, said Karajan
informed her of his decision in a letter received Monday from his
home in Salzburg, Austria, where the conductor has been confined by
his illnesses.
   ``The results of the medical examinations, which now have
stretched for weeks, make it impossible for me to fulfill my
obligations,'' he said in the letter released in Salzburg, where he
was born.
   Karajan's resignation leaves open one of the most coveted
conductor's posts in the world.
   ``I respect this decision by Herbert von Karajan, which comes
for health reasons,'' Ms. Martiny told The Associated Press.
   ``I hope that Karajan's friends in Berlin will have one more
opportunity to see him conducting the Berlin Philharmonic'' in a
farewell performance, Ms. Martiny said.
   Karajan's letter said that despite repeated requests, the former
Berlin administration had failed to make clear what his rights and
responsibilities as ``conductor for life'' involved.
   ``I must also point out that for years I have asked your
predecessors to finally make clear my duties and rights,'' Karajan
wrote to Ms. Martiny, a Social Democrat who has been cultural
senator for two months. ``Although I have asked repeatedly, to date
this has not come forth.''
   Ursula Vogel, an aide to Ms. Martiny, said the decision on a
successor would be made by the orchestra administration, with the
choice to be confirmed by Berlin officials.
   No one at the Berlin Philharmonic office was available to
discuss possible replacements for Karajan, said a man who answered
the telephone Monday.
   Two names Karajan himself has mentioned as potential successors
are Soviet-born Semyon Bychkov and Italy's Carlo Maria Giulini.
   Karajan has long been in poor health, having suffered a stroke,
failing vision, chronic back problems and circulatory problems. He
has undergone at least five operations in the past 12 years and has
been visibly hindered since undergoing surgery in 1983.
   He walks with difficulty and has required a supporting chair
behind the conducting pulpit for more than two years.
   He has canceled a number of performances over the past few years
and become increasingly reclusive, venturing from his Salzburg home
infrequently.
   The absences exacerbated criticism of the conductor, who has
long been the subject of controversy because of his Nazi Party
membership during Adolf Hitler's Third Reich and the reputedly
lavish terms of his contract.
   The West German weekly magazine Der Spiegel has said Karajan
earns more than $6 million a year from his recordings, as well as
his salary from the state-supported Berlin Philharmonic.
   Karajan wrote to Berlin authorities in February asking that they
ease his contractual obligations because of his poor state of
health.
   The cultural affairs department agreed to reduce the conductor's
schedule from 12 concerts per year to six. But Karajan has not
returned to Berlin to conduct the orchestra since the revision was
agreed to.

   The United States must seize opportunities to strengthen and
support developments that advance the cause of freedom _ and we
will.
   We've made a good start these first three months, and there's
more to come.
   The completion of our defense and foreign policy reviews in late
May, draft legislation for a new Clean Air Act, a new strategy to
curb the increased use of lethal weapons by drug dealers and other
criminals, and new initiatives to combat the problem of
homelessness in America _ all are on the near horizon.
   You know, some of my toughest critics aren't members of the
media _ quite often, they're the children who write to me at the
White House.
   I want to share with you a letter from a young fellow _ a
seventh-grader from Torrance, Calif.
   He wrote asking me to take action on pollution, toxic waste,
smog, littering _ a very detailed list of environmental concerns.
   He says in his letter: ``I am not saying you're doing a bad job,
but could you put a little more effort into it?''
   Now, I want you to know when that letter was written: Jan. 20,
1989 _ Inauguration Day.
   I don't know whether I've managed to satisfy the young man who
wrote that letter, but I can say I got his message.
   As I've said before, I am a practical man; I like what's real.
   I'm not much for the airy and abstract.
   I like what works.
   There's a running debate on what it takes to move a nation
forward.
   Some say it's ideology that matters.
   Some say it's a question of competence.
   Others say that issues are ``the issue.''
   But the fact is, what it takes to move a nation can't be
captured in one word.
   It's a matter of principles _ and performance. Ideology _ and
action on the issues.
   This administration understands that the American people expect
all of these _ and something more.
   They expect results.
   So while I'm pleased with all we've accomplished in these three
months, there's a long road ahead of us.
   I'm optimistic _ that our reforms will produce lasting results;
that the long-range planning we do today will pay off in the future.
   But most of all, this nation is ready to move forward to meet
the central challenges we face: keeping America free, prosperous
and at peace, tomorrow, and into the century ahead.

   Students at most Beijing colleges exuberantly
began a class boycott Monday to press for sweeping democratic
reforms, and they tried through speeches and posters to enlist
workers in the cause.
   Authorities took no open steps to interfere, but sources said
more than 10,000 soldiers from outlying counties moved into Beijing
over the weekend in preparation for an eventual crackdown.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
troops had been used in the past to quash civil unrest. Some
student leaders said they feared imminent arrest.
   The exact number of participants in the boycott was not known,
but students at a dozen schools with total enrollment of more than
50,000 said virtually all their classmates were striking.
   The boycott was the largest in 40 years of communist rule, even
though there were no reports of students joining in other cities as
the student activists hoped.
   ``Now is the time for all students in Beijing and nationwide to
united to fight for democracy!'' a student speaker at Qinghua
University yelled from a banner-strewn dormitory balcony to about
1,500 wildly cheering listeners. He proclaimed the balcony a ``free
speech platform'' and invited orators with all views.
   Students from several schools marched around campus and on
nearby streets, gave speeches on street corners and plastered
copies of the first edition of their own newspaper on lampposts and
trees to publicize their demands for press freedom, an end to
official privileges and corruption, and respect for human rights.
   The boycott marks a new phase in the campaign after a week in
which the students, mourning the death of former reformist party
chief Hu Yaobang, tried to confront the leadership directly. They
marched repeatedly to central Beijing's Tiananmen Square and tried
to storm Communist Party headquarters.
   Top officials, who have begun market-style economic reforms but
insist China is not ready for democracy, refused to meet with them.
   Student leaders stressed Monday they wanted their protest to be
peaceful and legal, and that they were not seeking to overthrow the
government or party.
   However, many students said they want Premier Li Peng to resign,
along with other officials they consider inept or too old. Several
posters even called for the complete retirement of senior leader
Deng Xiaoping, 84, who still wields power from behind the secnes.
   ``We haven't really thought about who would take their places,''
said an English student at Beijing Normal University.
   Several posters attacked nepotism, listing the names of
relatives of top leaders who have been given government jobs. One
referred to Deng's son, head of the China Welfare Fund for the
disabled, as ``Prince'' Deng Pufang.
   At Qinghua University, known as a training ground for China's
technocrats, a school announcement carried over loudspeakers said
officials opposed the boycott and wanted students ``to calm down.''
It added: ``We want to make clear that the school has always
cherished the students even though some are engaging in activities
of which it does not approve.''
   The state-run Xinhua News Agency sought to minimize the strike,
saying: ``teaching and studying at most of the city's colleges and
universities remained normal.'' It did not mention the reason for
the boycott.
   However, the neighborhood in northwestern Beijing where the
largest universities are located was turned Monday into a huge
debating ground, with clusters of students distributing leaflets
and earnestly telling passersby about police beatings of student
protesters last week.
   Efforts to enlist the support of workers, begun Sunday, were
stepped up.
   ``Workers, listen to us,'' shouted one philosophy student to a
crowd of about 500 people. ``We are fighting for the rights of all
Chinese.''
   At the People's University, one student put a tape player in his
dormitory window overlooking the street and played political
speeches made in recent days, including one criticizing Li Peng as
inept. A crowd of nearly 1,000 people formed to listen, blocking
traffic.
   About 1,000 students from the Beijing Foreign Languages College
marched from school to school to encourage fellow strikers. More
than 1,200 students from the Central College of Minorities marched
to nearby People's University to read posters there.
   Chen Mingyuan, a well-known researcher at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences, spoke at Qinghua and Beijing universities to
encourage the students.
   ``Maybe there are some plainclothes police here,'' he told a
Qinghua crowd. ``If they are trying to take down the names of all
of us, then their lot is hard indeed.'' The crowd roared with
laughter.
   Most students said they planned to boycott classes until May 4,
the 70th anniversary of China's first student movement. That
campaign also fought for democracy while galvanizing the entire
nation in opposition to Japanese encroachments on Chinese soil.
   But the current student movement also showed serious
organizational weakness Monday when student leaders at Beijing
University began quarreling openly during a rally of about 5,000
students. They disagreed on whether sit-ins and other
confrontational tactics should be resumed.
   There were no reports of new student activities in other cities
Monday. Foreign sources reported new looting Sunday night in the
central city of Changsha in Hunan province, where young toughs
mixed in with a student protest Saturday and went on a rampage.
   Non-students also rioted after a student gathering Saturday in
the northwestern tourist city of Xian.

   Psychiatrists are up in arms about a new law
allowing the military to train its psychologists to prescribe
powerful drugs for depression and mental illness.
   It's the newest battlefield for a long-running dispute over who
is qualified to write prescriptions. Psychiatrists, who have
medical degrees, say their qualifications are indispensable. But
psychologists, who don't have M.D.'s, suggest money is really at
the heart of efforts to keep them out.
   Currently, no state permits psychologists to prescribe
psychotropic drugs, which range from mild tranquilizers to
anti-psychotic medications that can affect the cardiovascular and
motor systems.
   The new provision on military psychologists, pushed by Sen.
Daniel K. Inouye, D-Hawaii, was included in a House-Senate
conference report on the fiscal year 1989 appropriation for the
Defense Department. Congress approved the measure Sept. 30, 1988,
and it was signed by then-President Reagan the next day.
   ``Given the importance of addressing `battle fatigue,' the
conferees agree that the department should establish a
demonstration pilot training program under which military
psychologists may be trained and authorized to issue appropriate
psychotropic medications under certain circumstances,'' according
to a legislative report accompanying the provision.
   Courtney Welton, an Army spokesman, said the service ``is
considering'' the issue, including training procedures, but he did
not know when such a program might be begun.
   Inouye's efforts on behalf of psychologists have been spurred by
his administrative assistant, Patrick DeLeon, a trained
psychologist and member of the board of the American Psychological
Association.
   DeLeon, in a written presentation last December, said it is
``absurd, to put it mildly,'' to ``proclaim that one needs to go to
medical school and take all of their courses'' in order to write
prescriptions for psychotropic drugs.
   In a telephone interview, DeLeon said the Defense Department
``seems a perfect place for this expansion'' of psychologists'
authority to prescribe drugs because of its training facilities and
a high incidence of mental health problems in the military.
   That's not how the medical community sees it.
   ``To attempt to provide military psychologists with prescribing
privileges without accredited medical education and post-graduate
clinical residence training ... trivializes medical diagnosis and
judgment,'' said Dr. Melvin Shabshin, medical director of the
American Psychiatric Association.
   Dr. Donald Bennett, director of the drug division at the
American Medical Association, said simply, ``We think it is
inappropriate for psychologists to prescribe psychoactive drugs.''
   ``These drugs are not to be used lightly,'' added Dr. Donald
Klein, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia University. One
hazard, he said, is the ``potential interactions between the
psychiatric drugs and medical drugs _ those interactions at times
can be dangerous.''
   The group that represents the nation's 50,000 licensed
psychologists, the American Psychological Association, says
America's roughly 34,000 psychiatrists oppose the measure for
selfish, monopolistic reasons.
   ``They don't even want it studied,'' said Bryant Welch,
executive director of the psychological association's professional
practices division. ``The reason they are doing this is to protect
their own pocketbooks.''
   Meantime, DeLeon, who has worked for Inouye for 16 years and
also holds a law degree, has been a key person in the drive to
broaden the role of psychologists.
   ``The bottom line of what we are trying to do is basically to
improve the quality of mental health care,'' he said. ``Everything
is coming back to that.''
   As an active member of the psychological association, DeLeon has
traveled and given speeches at the group's expense, according to
his 1987 financial disclosure form, the latest ones available.
   He visited Hawaii, New Orleans and New York that year, with the
association picking up the tab for lodging and meals. The group
also paid air travel between Washington and Hawaii and New Orleans.
   DeLeon also collected $2,500 from the association for editing a
journal.
   Inouye said he wholeheartedly supports DeLeon's activities on
behalf of the psychological association.
   ``I not only approve but encourage Pat DeLeon's membership on
the APA board,'' Inouye said in a statement. ``I am proud that his
talents and expertise in the field of psychology are recognized by
his peers.''
   DeLeon wrote last year that the top priority for ``our
profession'' in 1989 is to enact a bill that would enable
psychologists to receive direct payments from Medicare for
services. The measure, similiar to one introduced by Inouye last
year, is expected to cost $10 million.
   Inouye, who lost an arm fighting in World War II, is a member of
the Senate appropriations subcommittees on defense and labor,
health and human services.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a television interview
broadcast Monday night, said the three most pressing problems
facing America's school are ``drugs, drugs and drugs.''
   ``I hope that's not a frivolous answer,'' he said, ``but I want
to say it that way because of the impact that drugs are having.
They have it on the morale of teachers. They have it on discipline
in the classroom. They have ... the adverse impact on the areas
that need help the most.''
   Bush was interviewed for the fifth and last segment of
``Learning In America,'' a television series that concluded Monday
night on most Public Broadcasting Service stations.
   Bush said he intends to be ``the education president'' despite
limited federal resources, mainly by giving moral support to the
teachers, parents, states and cities that run the nation's schools.
   ``A lot of what a president can do is hortatory, encourage the
people that have the ... main responsibility for education,'' Bush
told PBS correspondent Roger Mudd.
   The president said he is trying to leave his mark on education
despite the limits on federal aid and authority in the area because
``education holds the key. It holds the key to a better life for
our young people, and it holds the key to the United States being
competitive in world markets. And it holds the key to whipping the
problem of drug abuse.''
   Bush said that teachers are ``never going to have it made... in
a financial sense'' but added that the nation must find some way to
show them ``that we respect those who choose that profession, and
find ways to encourage more to do it.''
   In response to other questions, Bush promoted his education
agenda, which calls for greater accountability on the part of
schools, more liberal teacher certification policies and letting
parents choose which public school their children attend. He said
giving parents that choice could help eliminate inequities that
affect children in disadvantaged areas.
   Bush's comment came after Mudd noted that a child in a ghetto
high school in Camden, N.J., has less than $4,000 spent on him
while $7,000 is spent on a child in affluent Princeton, N.J.
   ``The federal government can't smooth out everything like
this,'' Bush said. But he added that parental choice is one answer
to such inequities. ``They might not be able to move from Camden to
Princeton, but if we have this choice take hold, they can move into
a school that is less heavily impacted by drugs...'' he said.
   Mudd also told Bush that his presidential campaign slogan of
``Read my lips _ no new taxes'' has been picked up by state
legislators. He said at least two governors have hit a stone wall
in seeking new taxes to pay for education improvements .
   ``So now we have the phenomenon of an education president being
used as a cover to refuse to raise taxes to improve education,''
Mudd said.
   Bush replied that the federal government should ``hold the line
on taxes and not create taxes that take away from the state's
resource base. And so I would let each state governor, obviously,
make his own decision or her own decision. But I will not
criticize, nor extend the read-my-lips syndrome to every governor
that ... is mandated to balance budgets.''

   The University of Utah chemist who claimed
to have achieved nuclear fusion in a jar of water said he and his
British colleague plan a new round of experiments to expand on
their findings.
   B. Stanley Pons said one experiment will be five times larger
than the table-top apparatus he and Martin Fleischmann used.
   ``I think this round of experiments will bring up a host of new
data,'' Pons said before leaving for Washington, where he and
Fleischmann were to address a congressional committee about their
work.
   The two stunned the scientific world and provoked deep
skepticism March 23 when they announced they had developed a fusion
apparatus that produced four times the energy needed to power it.
   Fusion, the process behind the sun and the hydrogen bomb,
releases energy by fusing atoms together. Nuclear fission, the
process used in nuclear reactors, splits them apart.
   Scientists have long believed that fusion requires staggeringly
high temperatures. If Pons' claim of room temperature fusion is
borne out, it could open the door to a cheap and virtually
unlimited source of energy.
   Groups of scientists around the world have claimed to have
duplicated at least part of the experiment.
   Pons said up to 20 experiments would begin over the next two
weeks. Among them will be tests of different metals than the
palladium used in the original experiments and new designs for the
apparatus.

<TEXT>
   Four people were arrested Monday after
they chained themselves to a concrete slab poured over the weekend
in an effort to build a permanent toilet on university-owned
People's Park.
   The protesters were cited on misdemeanor charges of entering
property with the intent to cause damage, said Sgt. Leroy Pereira
of the University of California at Berkeley, which owns the
2.3-acre lot.
   Campus workers later tore up the slab and carted it away. There
was no resistance by those arrested, although officers had to use
bolt cutters to remove them, said Pereira.
   On Thursday, 50 people commemorating the 20th anniversary of the
founding of the park started building the toilet, only to have it
torn up the next morning by campus workers and police. They
returned over the weekend.
   The park had its beginning on April 20, 1969, when activists
began occupying the empty lot, which had been bought by the
university 10 months earlier. The school intended to build student
housing there.
   A month later, riots erupted as the campus fenced the lot and
tore up shrubs and grass sod planted by the activists. During the
riots, one man was killed, an artist blinded and hundreds of others
wounded by authorities.
   The fence was torn down in 1972 by protesters, and the
university since then has allowed limited use of the land by the
public, with the condition that nothing permanent be built on it.

   New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange said
Monday he is not willing to ``buy'' an invitation to the White

policies.
   Lange, on a six-day visit to the United States, said from New

the price of coming to Washington is having nuclear vessels in New

   Lange, speaking on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show before speaking at
Yale University, said ``New Zealand would welcome (a) political
contact, but not so as to buy our route to the White House. We will
not pay the price of having a nuclear policy in New Zealand. We
won't have nuclear weapons in New Zealand.''
   New Zealand has banned visits by ships carrying nuclear weapons
or powered by atomic reactors, leading the United States in 1986 to
suspend security guarantees for the Pacific nation under terms of
the ANZUS alliance between Australia, the United States and New
Zealand.
   The United States refuses to confirm or deny the existence of
nuclear weapons on its ships and planes, a policy which has
strained its relations with several allies, including Denmark.
Lange said he was certain the U.S. measures toward New Zealand were
designed to deter other countries from adopting similar
anti-nuclear policies.
   ``I'm sure that that was the concern of the United States,''
Lange said.
   The United States ``continues to view New Zealand as a friendly
country, but not an ally,'' said a State Department official who
requested anonymity.
   In addition to the diplomatic cooling, Lange said, the United
States has stopped sharing military intelligence information with
New Zealand.
   But ``at most practical levels, we have an extraordinarily good
relationship with the United States. I relish coming here. A lot of
Americans relish going to New Zealand,'' Lange said.
   In fact, trade between the two countries, including U.S.
military sales, has increased, he said. Figures provided by the
State Department show U.S. exports to New Zealand rose from $933
million in 1986 to $1.19 billion in 1988; imports rose from $908
million to $1.23 billion in 1988.
   But department officials said the increase was independent of
strains in diplomatic relations and the United States had made a
point of not allowing general relations to be soured by the
political disagreement.
   Asked for his explanation of the strengthening economic ties
between New Zealand and the United States, Lange said ``you don't
have to have the blessing of the United States and approval of your
defense policies to make a living in this world. I think the Soviet
Union has demonstrated that.''

   It may not be in church, but it will be
a kosher wedding for a couple who plan to exchange vows before
thousands of people at the North Carolina Pickle Festival at Mount
Olive.
   Amy Rebecca Smith, 19, didn't relish the idea from her fiance,
an employee of Chas. F. Cates &amp; Sons Inc., which makes a dozen
varieties of pickles.
   ``She wanted an old-fashioned church wedding,'' said Timothy
Grady Gautier, 23.
   But the two entered a contest that sought a couple willing to
get married April 29 during the pickle festival.
   Only six couples applied, including a woman who said she would
use cucumber vines and sprigs of dill in her wedding bouquet, Miss
Smith said.
   Miss Smith's application said the two have stayed together
through hamburgers and pickles. Gautier helped Miss Smith, who
worked past midnight at her father's restaurant, Smitty's Big Tee
Chicken &amp; Burgers. He would then get up early to go to work in the
pickle-packing plant.
   ``The wedding itself is going to be traditional,'' Miss Smith
said. But jars of pickles and baskets of cucumbers will decorate
each side of the wedding platform and steps.
   William L. Hennessee Jr., president of Cates; Johnny Walker,
president of Mt. Olive Pickle; and D.F. Odom, mayor of Mount Olive,
will sign the marriage certificate as witnesses.

   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Students hung up on homework can call a hot
line to plug into a teacher ready to help.
   The Jersey City School District started the hot line a year ago.
   ``I felt it was something that would be a benefit, especially
because we have so many latchkey children who don't have parents
who can help them when they come home,'' said Elaine White, the hot
line's founder and the district's affirmative action officer.
   The hot line handles queries from students in the third through
sixth grades.
   ``Math is the No. 1 question and it usually is math
computations,'' said Ms. White. ``A lot of it has to do with times
tables and what you're doing to get the answer.''
   A $20,000 state grant pays for H.E.L.P. _ the Homework and
Education Line for Parents and Students. Four teachers, including
one who speaks Spanish, field calls from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday
through Thursday.
   Last year the program operated from April through mid-June,
logging as many as 40 calls a day initially, said Ms. White. It
resumed in February.
   The consulting teachers are paid $14.50 an hour.

<HEAD>His 100-Day Verdict: Good Start on Issues Demanding Decisive Action</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs grafs 15-16, In unusual ... Reagan, to update with speech
delivered</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, nearing the 100-day milestone of
his administration, said today he was off to a ``good start'' with
bipartisan agreements on the budget and Contra aid but that
``difficult decisions lie ahead.''
   Bush said his administration is now ``mapping strategies for a
period of remarkable change in international affairs,'' and he
referred to upcoming high-level meetings with Moscow. A foreign
policy review, which some had hoped would be completed far earlier,
is now due in late May, he said.
   Bush issued the report on his first three months in office
during an address to publishers gathered for the annual luncheon of
The Associated Press. He flew here after attending a memorial
service in Norfolk, Va., for the 47 sailors killed in the gun
turret explosion on the battleship Iowa last Wednesday.
   ``To all who mourn a son, a brother, a husband, a father, a
friend, _ I can only offer you the gratitude of a nation, for your
loved one served his country with distinction and honor,'' the
president said.
   ``We will not _ we cannot, as long as we live _ know why God has
called them home. But of one thing we can be sure _ this world is a
more peaceful place because of the USS Iowa.''
   Bush's voice cracked momentarily as he declared, ``May God bless
the USS Iowa and all who walk her deck.''
   For most of the half-hour service, Bush and his wife, Barbara,
sat somber-faced among the families of the victims, some of whom
sobbed openly. Seated to Bush's left was Elbia Martinez, widow of
Seaman Apprentice Jose Luis Martinez Jr. of Hidalgo, Texas. Seated
to Mrs. Bush's right was Lisa Everhart, widow of Seaman Apprentice
Leslie Allen Everhart Jr. of Cary, N.C.
   Afterwards, the Bushes walked among the families, shaking their
hands and offering condolences. He gently kissed one woman mourner
on the forehead, and caressed another woman's head in a tender hug.
   Bush smiled occasionally as he consoled the relatives, and he
explained to reporters later: ``The Bush family's not very good at
that kind of thing, anyway. But you've got to deal with it, you've
got to show them some concern. You know how you do it? Pray for
strength.
   ``I did choke up at the end, but I did feel a kind of inner
peace about the thing. I felt I had to represent our country. This
one was tough.''
   Despite the tragedy, Bush said the nation still needs
battleships. ``They're a useful platform for our missiles,'' he
said. ``There's a hell of a lot of firepower there. I don't think
the guns are obsolete. The firepower is enormous and the accuracy
is supposed to be pretty good.''
   Beginning a four-day trip, Bush also planned stops today in
Bismarck, N.D., and San Jose, Calif. The 100-day mark of his
administration falls on Saturday and Bush was expected to beat the
drum for his presidency in a succession of out-of-Washington
engagements this week.
   ``In three short months, we've made a good start coming to grips
with issues demanding urgent attention and decisive action,'' Bush
told the publishers.
   He took credit for drafting a plan to rescue the savings and
loan industry, a proposal to tighten ethical standards in
government and with making the District of Columbia a ``test case
for a full range of innovative anti-drug measures.''
   In unusual back-to-back appearances here, Bush spoke shortly
after Vice President Dan Quayle addressed the AP annual meeting.
The publishers ere gathered for the American Newspaper Publishers
Association convention.
   ``We used to hear a lot about the presidency being too big for
one man,'' Bush said in his speech. ``That talk stopped with Ronald
Reagan.''
   The president noted that in his first three months, he forged a
budget plan with Congress designed to reduce the deficit.
``Difficult decisions lie ahead, but an important agreement has
been achieved,'' he said.
   Moreover, he noted the accord with Capitol Hill to continue the
flow of humanitarian aid to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   ``Of course, dealing with problems that demand immediate
attention is only part of the picture,'' Bush said. ``We need to
look to the long-term as well _ to focus now on the kind of future
we want to see for ourselves and our nation.''
   He said his administration was ``mapping strategies for a period
of remarkable change in international affairs, change more
wide-ranging and rapid than at any time in the post-war period.
   ``While we will lead, we also intend to consult and listen, to
our friends abroad and to the Congress.''
   He noted that Secretary of State James A. Baker III will meet
next month with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   ``We've made a good start these first three months and there's
more to come,'' Bush said. ``The completion of our defense and
foreign policy reviews in late May, draft legislation for a new
Clean Air Act, a new strategy to curb the increased use of lethal
weapons by drug dealers and other criminals and new initiatives to
combat the problem of homelessness in America _ all are on the near
horizon.''
   Pronouncing himself pleased with the first three months, Bush
said, ``there's a long road ahead of us. I'm optimistic that our
reforms will produce lasting results, that the long-range planning
we do today will pay off in the future.''
   In the text of his remarks at te Norfolk Naval Air Station, Bush
said, ``Let me say to the Iowa crew, I understand your grief. I,
too, have stared at the empty bunks of lost shipmates and asked,
`Why?''' However, in delivering the speech, he omitted the latter
sentence.
   Bush, a World War II Navy pilot, said ``I was proud'' to
recommission the Iowa in 1984 as vice president. ``Now,'' he said,
``fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of the USS
Iowa.''
   ``They came from Hidalgo, Texas, and Cleveland, Ohio; from
Tampa, Fla. and Costa Mesa, Calif.,'' the president said of the 47
sailors killed in the turret explosion. ``They came to the Navy as
strangers, served the Navy as shipmates and friends and left the
Navy as brothers in eternity.''
   Bush added the Norfolk visit at the start of the busiest
domestic trip he has undertaken since his inauguration last Jan.
20. By the time he returns to Washington on Thursday night, he will
have visited Virginia, Illinois, North Dakota, California, Texas
and Florida.
   From Chicago, he was traveling to North Dakota's capital city of
Bismarck _ the first incumbent president to visit there since
Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953 _ where he was to plant a tree to mark
the state's centennial.
   Bush then was scheduled to fly west to California, where he had
defense-related and narcotics-related speeches before sitting down
for coffee Tuesday morning with Reagan at the former president's
Fox Plaza office suite. Later in the week, he will address the
Texas Legislature in Austin and make drug-related appearances in
Miami and Clearwater, Fla.
   Bush reportedly telephoned Reagan recently to apologize for
newspaper accounts that quoted unnamed Bush aides as comparing Bush
favorably to the now-retired two-term president.

<HEAD>Hussein Accepts Prime Minister's Resignation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein accepted the resignation of
Prime Minister Zaid Rifai and his government today following bloody
rioting over price increases.
   The monarch did not name a new prime minister, the official
Jordan Television said.
   The TV report carried an official statement saying Hussein
assigned secretaries-general of government ministries, second in
rank to appointed ministers, to run the departments until a new
government is formed.
   Sources said earlier today that Rifai, prime minister since
1985, had offered his resignation and that Hussein accepted it.
   The four days of riots, in which at least eight people died,
began Tuesday in the southern city of Maan and spread to dozens of
cities and villages throughout the kingdom.
   The official Jordan News Agency reported Sunday that Hussein had
``expressed his intention to deal with the roots of the problem and
all the reasons and causes of the latest incidents within a short
period of time.''
   Many rioters chanted slogans calling for Rifai's ouster. They
also shouted their support for the king.
   Rifai has been widely blamed for falling living standards in
Jordan. The annual per capita income has slumped from about $2,000
in the mid-1980s to about $1,200.
   The government last year imposed import controls and austerity
measures to help deal with mounting payments on a $6 billion debt.
   The rioting was triggered by 10 percent to 50 percent increases
in the prices of gasoline, cigarettes and other commodities. The
price increases were carried out under an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund to pave the way for rescheduling the
debt payments.
   Rifai, 52, was a boyhood friend of King Hussein who became one
of his most trusted advisers.
   No Jordanian prime minister served longer than Rifai. Besides
the term that began in April 1985, he also was prime minister from
1973 to 1976.
   Educated at Columbia and Harvard, Rifai earlier served as
ambassador to Britain and as chief of the royal court.
   His father, Samir, served six terms as prime minister in the
1940s, 1950s and 1960s, for a total of less than four years.

   ``The Flintstones'' and old documentaries replaced
sports and talk shows, and the half-hour midday news shrank to
eight minutes on BBC-TV and radio as thousands of employees staged
a 24-hour strike Monday over pay.
   Half the nation's non-cable television _ two channels _ and all
four of its national radio channels were disrupted by the
cancellation or shortening of live programs, said the publicly
funded British Broadcasting Corp.
   The three unions jointly organizing the strike estimated that
19,000 of the corporation's 25,000 employees stayed away from work
in the first walkout at the BBC in four years.
   They demanded a 16 percent pay increase to bring them in line
with commercial broadcasting salaries. The management has said it
cannot give them more than a 7 percent raise.
   ``We say to the management that if you care about public service
broadcasting then pay the rate for the job,'' Deputy General
Secretary Jake Ecclestone told a rally of 400 strikers in West
London.
   ``The BBC is underpaying its staff because it chooses to
underpay its staff,'' he said.
   Demonstrations also were called for Glasgow, Manchester,
Birmingham, Belfast and other major cities, and picket lines were
set up in London.
   The strike began at midnight, silencing hourly radio newscasts
between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. on the light entertainment station Radio
2. Top disc jockey Chris Stuart stayed away, and the newscast was
reduced to between two and five minutes.
   On the 24-hour Radio 4, the main news station, a repeat talk
show replaced the popular ``Today'' program, a documentary was
broadcast instead of a live consumer affairs show and an old
program on Cuba filled in for part of the midday news.
   The walkout caused the cancellation of the World Service radio's
global broadcasts of news commentary programs, financial reports
and daily review of the British press.
   On television, ``The Flintstones'' cartoon anchored an eclectic
lineup _ including a food show and a program on stuntman Evel
Knievel _ instead of the main morning show ``Breakfast Time'' on
BBC-1.
   BBC-1 also showed wildlife footage instead of the World Snooker
Championships and reduced its midday and evening half-hour news
shows to eight minutes. The strike was the second story on the
evening news.
   Unions say the national average pay for a BBC journalist is
$29,000 a year, compared with $41,000 in commercial radio or
television. Radio and television pay grades at the BBC are the same.
   A BBC radio engineer earns up to $18,210 a year while a
cameraman earns up to $20,280. Officials said star newscasters
negotiate their pay individually.
   But the BBC insists that because it exists on compulsory public
subscriptions it cannot afford to pay raises of more than 7 percent.
   The annual government-set license fee for a black-and-white TV
is about $43, and about $113 for a color TV. The BBC management
says the fee has not risen in line with inflation, and has left the
corporation short of funds.
   The strikers included 1,200 journalists, 3,000 technicians,
about 1,000 electricians and 13,000 members of the Broadcasting and
Entertainment Trades Alliance. Also represented were members of the
Association of Cinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians.

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's remarks
Monday at the annual luncheon of The Associated Press.
   Thank you, Bill.
   Thank you all, ladies and gentlemen.
   Thank you very much. (Continued applause.)
   Thank you all for that warm welcome.
   And my friend Bill Keating, friend from Congress days, thank you
for that most generous introduction.
   I also want to thank your able _ I don't know whether I should
say leaders or deputies at The Associated Press, Lou Boccardi
sitting over here, and Jim Tomlinson, and thank them and you for
including me in this AP luncheon, given at the time of the
Newspaper Publishers Association meeting.
   And I also want to say how pleased I am to be with you once
again.
   I've just come from Norfolk, a very moving ceremony, paying
tribute to the 47 young men that died in the turret aboard Iowa.
   And it was indeed moving, and it made me once again realize how
precious human life is and how sometimes you can't control things
the way you'd like.
   And that leads me to just say a word about Terry Anderson,
because in a meeting just now, in the greeting by Lou and Bill
Keating, they brought up with me once again, with this sense of
urgency that all in The Associated Press feel about Terry Anderson,
the question of the hostages.
   And I just want to say, without being able to give you any good
news, that we are concerned.
   We will follow every intelligence lead.
   We will go the extra mile to do what we can.
   And I vowed, when I came into the presidency, not to talk about
the burden of the presidency, the loneliness of the job or the
great toughness that nobody understands.
   I learned that from my immediate predecessor.
   Eight years and I never once heard a call for _ call for
sympathy or a call for understanding along those lines.
   But I will say that, when you do take that oath of office, you
do feel perhaps a disproportionate concern for a fallen sailor or
an individual held hostage against his or her will anywhere in the
world.
   And so we will continue to keep this question of these hostages
on the front burner.
   I know the news business is a serious and sometimes
extraordinarily dangerous business.
   Mark Twain liked to recall that Napoleon once shot at a magazine
editor.
   He missed him, but killed a publisher. (Laughter.)
   Twain says, it seems his aim was bad, but his intentions were
good. (Laughter.)
   You all know Jefferson's tribute to the importance of the press:
``Were it left for me to decide whether we should have a government
without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should
not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.''
   And, now, despite the fact that there are days when I think that
all we really need is the sports page _ (laughter) _ both of us,
government and the news media, need one another.
   We owe each other a measure of respect, honesty and integrity
equal to the work we're engaged in.
   And it's been a little over three months since I took the oath
of office, and I am very pleased with the progress we've made in
that short time.
   And I'll say more about that shortly, but before I do, I'd like
to speak for a moment about my impressions of these past three
months.
   People often ask me, understandably, what it's like _ how the
presidency compares to the expectations you bring to it.
   I can sum up the thing that's made the deepest impression on me
so far in one word, and it's history, a sense of history all around
you.
   And you can't live in the White House, you can't sit at that
desk in the Oval Office, or upstairs in the office I have now right
next door to the Lincoln Bedroom, without constantly experiencing
the history of the place _ without thinking of the presidents we
all know, but perhaps in a different light.
   And I think of Washington, working to define the presidency _ to
mix power and restraint in a way that created a chief executive
consistent with democratic government.
   This Sunday, I will be in New York to join in the ceremonies
marking the 200th anniversary of Washington's swearing-in.
   Each of those 200 years is lasting testimony to the solid
foundation laid by Washington.
   And I find myself thinking a lot of Teddy Roosevelt: his
limitless energy, his mental, moral and physical toughness.
   I want the record to show it's not just that he was an elitist
like me _ (scattered laughter) _ I think of his dedication to serve
his nation _ a dedication instilled in earliest childhood _ this
sense of service, and then I guess most of all, his love of nature,
his passion for reform and preservation.
   I think of Harry Truman: a man who spoke his mind, a practical
problem-solver and a fighter who never gave up _ and I learned that
the hard way because I'm old enough to have bet 10 bucks on Tom
Dewey back in 1948.
   And there's Ike, Dwight Eisenhower: hero to a generation, a man
who once he became president didn't appear to seek the spotlight,
but he understood the value of quiet, steady leadership, and led
this nation through a decade of growth, and progress and
prosperity.

   A 5-year-old girl maimed in a pipe bomb
explosion at a discount store a week ago probably will not be
released from the hospital for at least a week more, a hospital
spokesman said Monday.
   David Richards, a spokesman for Methodist Hospital, said Erin
Bower was in satisfactory and stable condition and eating solid
food.
   Erin's left hand was amputated after it was severely damaged
April 17, when a bomb concealed in a toothpaste container exploded
as she picked it up from a shelf at a K mart store.
   The explosion also injured Erin's left eye, but doctors said
they hoped she would regain partial vision in it.
   Surgeons planned to examine the eye again this week before
determining when Erin can return home to her parents, Kevin and
Maureen Bower of Indianapolis. Richards said it probably would be a
week to 10 days before she can leave the hospital.
   ``This past weekend, she was cheerful,'' Richards said. ``She
went to the playroom and played. Her grandparents and parents
visited with her on Sunday.''
   Meanwhile, investigators still were trying to identify two men
seen leaving the store moments after the bombing.
   ``We're still following up the 300 to 400 phone calls mentioning
names or incidents,'' said Lt. Joie Davis of the Marion County
Sheriff's Department.
   The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms planned to
bring in six out-of-state investigators this week, bringing the
total number of detectives working full time on the case to 20.
   Also, fragments from the bomb are being analyzed at a federal
crime laboratory in Rockville, Md.
   Rewards totaling more than $35,000 have been offered for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect, and
a fund also has been set up for the child.

   One of two young skiers who ignored
danger warnings on Mount Washington was swept about 100 yards by an
avalanche and was trapped under a layer of snow for four hours, but
survived.
   ``The guy is extremely lucky. Usually avalanche victims have
less than a 50-50 chance of survival after one half hour,'' Stu
Hoyt, a snow ranger with the U.S. Forest Service, said Monday. ``He
probably survived because of his low level of consciousness, so he
wasn't demanding all that much oxygen.''
   Ken Hawkins, 17, was in serious condition Monday with multiple
injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Hawkins and his friend David Hathaway, 16, both of Greenland,
were on Mount Washington on Sunday to ski Tuckerman Ravine.
   The ravine, on the east side of the mountain, is a popular
spring skiing spot for those intrepid enough to hike the 2{ miles
up and into the ravine and then brave its sheer pitch, which at
some points reaches 65 degrees. The ravine is about two-thirds of
the way up the 6,288-foot peak, the tallest in the Northeast.
   Hoyt said he passed the two on the trail to the ravine at about
8 a.m. and warned them that the ravine had received about 5 feet of
snow Saturday night and the avalanche danger was high.
   Mount Washington is known for some of the most changeable,
fiercest weather in the world. The world's highest wind speed, 231
mph, was recorded on the mountain. Snow has been recorded in every
month. Lists compiled by the Forest Service and other groups
indicate that about 103 people have died on or around the mountain
since 1849.
   ``They had gone past my warnings. They went past the signboard
at Hermit Lake that posted all the conditions. So they'd gone past
several warnings,'' Hoyt said.
   Shortly before noon, the two put on their skis and started
side-stepping up the headwall to make a run when the avalanche
``was released from above the headwall. It went by Dave Hathaway
and caught Ken Hawkins,'' Hoyt said. ``It was a good-sized
avalanche,'' and Hawkins was rolled about 100 yards.
   Hathaway yelled for Hawkins for about 15 minutes, then headed
down the trail toward Pinkham Notch camp but passed the snow
rangers' quarters. Eventually, word got back to the rangers that
Hawkins was missing and about a dozen people began searching.
   A searcher found Hawkins' gloved hand.
   ``He was under two feet of snow for about four hours,'' said
Norm Rayume of the Forest Service. ``It's amazing he survived it,
but he did.''

<HEAD>Forest Officials Prepare For Mushroom-Picking Onslaught</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBBY, Mont. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forest fires last summer followed by a wet
winter mean a big mushroom crop, and the U.S. Forest Service says
it's working to forestall ``mushroom wars'' among pickers lured by
the potential of $600 a day.
   ``We are expecting anywhere from 3,000 to 5,000 pickers to show
up,'' said Mike Johnson, a forest service employee at the Kootenai
National Forest in the remote northwest corner of Montana.
   An experienced picker who finds a good stand of the popular
morel mushroom can take in up to 120 pounds of them a day, and gets
about $5 per pound. With that kind of money as a draw, officials
say, trouble is possible.
   When the Umatilla National Forest in Oregon had a good mushroom
crop two years ago, for example, Grant County deputies investigated
shot-up vehicles, threats and fights, said Grant undersheriff Jim
McNellis.
   ``It turned into a real zoo in some places,'' he said.
   To keep the same thing from happening in Montana this year,
Kootenai and Flathead national forest officials said they will have
more patrols out and issue permits for mushroom pickers ($5) and
buyers ($500) who set up shop in the forest.
   ``Permits will give us a little control over what is going on
and help pay for some of the increased patrols we are planning,''
Johnson said.
   Mushrooms should start sprouting in the next two to three weeks,
and the peak of the season is the end of May. The season can wrap
up as early as June, but if if it's a wet summer, it can extend
into fall, Johnson said.
   Forest fires act as catalysts for production of edible
mushrooms, primarily morels, he said. A fire in the Kootenai forest
last summer burned 13,000 acres near here, while another fire
burned about 10,000 acres in the nearby Flathead forest.

   A man who owns a house in which Elvis
Presley and his parents once lived wants someone to buy it and move
it off its lot by May 1, but he wants the work done ``with love and
care.''
   Presley and his parents lived in the small brick house from
mid-1955 until May 1956, said David Isom.
   Isom said Sunday he wants to sell the home for $45,000 or more
and remove it from the property. An auto parts store is to be built
on the property.
   ``If this was Elvis week, somebody would show up and buy it
piece by piece and reassemble it at home,'' Isom said.
   Isom installed a sign in the front yard proclaiming: ``Elvis
Presley Lived Here _ 1955-56 _ House For Sale _ Move With Love &amp;
Care.''
   The Presley estate contacted Isom about possibly acquiring the
house and moving it to the grounds of Presley's Graceland estate in
Memphis, he said.
   ``The estate called and they were looking for a gift,'' Isom
said. ``This is not a charity; this is a business.''

   Four years into Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms,
the Communist Party leadership must decide how to handle restive
nationalities, how much power to give a new legislature and other
questions perestroika has raised.
   Some of them, including the fate of political maverick Boris N.
Yeltsin, may come up at a Central Committee meeting that begins
Tuesday.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told a
reporters no agenda had been announced for the Central Committee,
which has more than 300 members, but said the nationalities issue
would not be on it. A Western diplomat said the question probably
would come up, however, at least briefly.
   At least 20 people were killed in ethnic violence this month in
Soviet Georgia and more than 90 were killed last year in Armenia
and Azerbaijan, neighboring republics in the Caucasus region.
   Gorbachev, 58, has said an entire Central Committee meeting this
summer will be devoted to policy toward the more than 100
nationalities in the Soviet Union.
   He indicated in a meeting Jan. 8 with scientific and cultural
figures that a separate plenum would focus on ``conception of
social-economic development of the country.'' Gorbachev may have
been referring to the session that begins Tuesday.
   Tass, the official news agency, said Tuesday a Central Committee
panel meeting Monday worked out ways to increase the effectiveness
of capital investment and management in the social-economic area.
It gave no details.
   This will be the first full Central Committee meeting since the
March 26 elections, when at least three dozen top local officials
across the country lost bids for seats in a new parliament that
will choose a smaller legislature.
   Among the losers were Yuri Solovyev, a candidate member of the
ruling Poltiburo, the premiers of Lativa and Lithuania, the mayor
and party chief of Kiev, and the mayor and No. 2 party leader of
Moscow.
   Defeats in elections to the Congress of People's Deputies were
particularly embarrassing for Communists who ran unopposed.
Multiple-candidate races were the first since the Bolshevik
Revolution 70 years ago.
   The Central Committee could dismiss members who lost campaigns
for parliament, but that would not affect Ukrainian party boss
Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, the only Politburo holdover from the
leadership of Leonid I. Brezhnev. Shcherbitsky, 71, won his seat.
   Another winner was Yeltsin, who ran an anti-establishment
campaign and got 89 percent of the vote. At its last meeting, the
Central Committee opened an investigation of Yeltsin, who was
dismissed as Moscow party chief after saying Gorbachev's reforms
had not accomplished enough.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, the Communist Party's chief ideologist, has
said a committee examining the charges would report at the next
plenary meeting. The Central Committee has the power to discipline
Yeltsin, who still is a member.
   Gorbachev portrayed the March election as a referendum on
reform. He said party and government officials lost because they
``were restructuring slowly.''
   Central Committee members laid the foundation for Gorbachev's
overhaul of the economic, political and social systems at a meeting
April 23, 1985, six sweeks after he became party chief.
   The Western diplomat, who spoke privately, said Tuesday's
meeting might focus on political reform and plans for the
2,250-seat parliament, whose first meeting is scheduled for May 25.
It is to elect a president as well as a full-time legislature.

   Richard M. Daley was sworn in as this city's 45th
mayor Monday _ his 47th birthday _ and promised he would be a
conductor who would orchestrate harmony in the city his father led
for 21 years.
   ``The old ways of doing things simply aren't adequate to cope
with the new challenges we face,'' said Daley, whose victory over
two black politicians earlier this year split voters sharply along
racial lines.
   Monday's ceremony was at Orchestra Hall, and Daley used the
setting as a theme for his speech. He said the patchwork of a city
is like a collection of instruments that can make beautiful music
only when working together.
   ``Today, I have been handed the conductor's baton, and to the
people of Chicago, wherever you live, let me assure you that your
voices will be heard,'' he said.
   Daley was sworn in by Senior U.S. District Judge Abraham Lincoln
Marovitz, who performed the same service for the late Richard J.
Daley six times before the elder Daley died in office in 1976.
   Daley, a Democrat, later took a congratulatory call from
President Bush, who was in the city to address the annual meeting
of The Associated Press.
   With Daley in office, Chicago became the largest U.S. city in
which voters have replaced a black mayor with a white.
   Daley was elected April 4 to complete the last two years of the
second term of the late Harold Washington, the first black mayor in
the nation's third-largest city. Daley succeeds Eugene Sawyer,
named acting mayor by the City Council following Washington's death
in office 17 months ago.
   Sawyer, who also is black, lost to Daley in the Democratic
primary Feb. 28. In April, Daley easily defeated black third-party
candidate Timothy Evans and Democrat-turned-Republican Edward
Vrdolyak.
   Daley's father ran a political machine fueled by Democratic
patronage, but Daley said those days are gone.
   ``You don't hand down policies from generation to generation,''
he said. But he said he shared with his father ``a love for our
city and a zest for public service.''
   Black civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who warned while
campaigning for Sawyer and Evans that Daley would revive machine
politics, said Daley struck a positive chord in his inaugural
speech and in naming a multi-racial group last week as his first
Cabinet nominees.
   ``He appears to be using a reconciling approach as opposed to a
polarizing Daley acknowledged that he faces challenges, includeing
the tasks of providing affordable housing and running the city on a
thin budget.
   ``We can't in two years solve every problem or cure every social
ill,'' he said. ``We can only begin.'' approach, and that is
good,'' Jackson said.
   Daley and his wife have three children _ Nora, 15, Patrick, 13,
and Elizabeth, 5. A fourth child, Kevin, died of the crippling
defect spina bifida when he was 2.
   Daley served three terms in the Illinois Senate and was elected
to his third term as Cook County state's attorney last year.

   Sweden's royal couple will get a new
airplane after Queen Silvia complained their old one was too
cramped for her hats and lacked adequate mirrors to fix her make-up.
   King Carl XVI Gustaf ordered a Swedish-built SAAB 340 B,
outfitted with a telephone, telex and a spacious wardrobe, palace
spokeswoman Elisabeth Tarras-Wahlberg said Monday.
   The Queen refused to fly any more in the old royal plane, a
Fairchild Metro III, Mrs. Tarras-Wahlberg said.
   ``She got fed up with the old plane, which she claimed was
uncomfortable, noisy and cramped. It even lacked mirrors so the
Queen had problems checking her make-up before leaving the plane on
state visits,'' she said.
   The commercial model of the propeller-driven SAAB normally seats
up to 50 passengers. The royal plane, which will cost over $11
million, also will be used by members of the government.

   About 900 people who hope to see Durham
become a national jazz center turned out for a benefit for the
Thelonious Monk Jazz Institute.
   Thomas Carter, national executive director of the Monk
Institute. Carter said Monday afternoon he had just put the last
guest celebrity, actress Bea Arthur, on a plane and had not had
time to check the receipts.
   But he said, ``It was very much a success, both from a dinner
standpoint and a student standpoint.''
   Officials staged the benefit Sunday to raise money to plan for
the institute, named for the late Rocky Mount native and pianist
known as the ``High Priest of Bebop.''
   ``Durham is where this should be,'' said Thelonious Monk Jr.,
the performer's son. ``The cultural community of the golden
Triangle is incredible _ New York is relatively dead compared to
here.'' He referred to the Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill area.
   The institute, planned as the first four-year undergraduate
school of jazz in the world, is to open in downtown Durham in 1991.
It will be affiliated primarily with Duke University.
   Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis headed a group of performers at
Sunday's concert featuring jazz greats Dizzy Gillespie, Hank Jones,
Slide Hampton and others. Bea Arthur and Rue McClanahan of NBC's
``The Golden Girls'' were hosts.
   About 300 dinner guests paid $250 each and 600 college and high
school students bought tickets to the event at $10 each.
   Upcoming in New York and Los Angeles are benefits for the
institute with the premiere of the Clint Eastwood movie
``Theolonious Monk: Straight, No Chaser,'' which was the title of
one of Monk's works.

   Cher's ex-bagel baker boyfriend received no
jail time for smashing a photographer's camera, but was placed
Monday on two years' probation and sentenced to perform 300 hours
of community service and pay $1,175 in fines and court costs.
   Rob Camilletti, 24, was accused of trying to run down free-lance
photographer Peter Brandt on July 27 outside Cher's home.
   He pleaded no contest Feb. 28 to two counts of vandalism. A
reckless driving charge was dismissed at sentencing.
   Camilletti was not present in West Los Angeles Municipal Court
for the sentencing by Judge Ronald Schoenberg.
   During a news conference after the incident, Cher and Camilletti
angrily denied he tried to run down the photographer. The actress
blamed pesky paparazzi and the frustration of living in the
spotlight for the flare-up.
   Cher, 42, who won a best actress Oscar in 1988 for her role in
``Moonstruck,'' has since moved out of the Benedict Canyon home
where the incident took place.
   Camilletti, who met Cher at a New York nightclub on her 40th
birthday, could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined
$2,000.

   Gov. Richard Celeste poked fun of himself
at a ceremony Monday opening a new press room and choosing the best
cartoon of the governor.
   Kirk Walters of The Toledo Blade, whose drawings of Celeste as a
modern-day King Louis XIV of France _ with over-the-shoulder curls
and spectacles _ won first place in a ``portrait'' competition
judged by Statehouse reporters.
   Celeste referred to a half-dozen political cartoonists who
entered the nonsense competition as ``my pals around the state, who
like to skewer me.'' He said they have studied his features ``and
know me best.''
   He said he knows his features are tempting caricatures. ``If you
have a good chin, you might as well use it,'' he laughed. Walters
said Celeste, with jutting chin, has a profile ``that is easy to
draw . . . a half-moon face.''
   Gary Ness, director of the Ohio Historical Society who joined in
the one-liners, said it was the first time a governor ``ever called
such attention to himself, at least consciously.''
   Celeste held the event in a news conference room in the new
state office building, across the street from the Statehouse. He
moved his office from the capitol to new building several weeks ago.

<HEAD>Armenians Hold Memorial for 1915 Genocide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet Armenians on Monday observed a day of
mourning in memory of a 1915 massacre, the first time that April 24
has been recognized by the government as a holiday, Tass said.
   ``Men, women, old men and children have been marching in an
unending stream since early morning toward Tsitsernakerberd Hill,
where the memorial of sorrow and the revival of the Armenian people
rises over Yerevan,'' Tass said.
   The Supreme Soviet recently approved legislation making April 24
an official day of remembrance and a day off for workers, the news
agency said.
   ``It is for the first time this year that April 24 was marked in
Soviet Armenia officially,'' Tass said. ``Under the law of the
Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic `on denouncing the 1915 genocide
of Armenians in Osman Turkey,' the parliament of the republic has
decreed this date the day of remembrance of the victims of
genocide,'' it said.
   Armenians say more than 1.5 million people died in the massacres
in the waning days of the Ottoman empire from 1915 to 1918. Turkish
officials have disputed the 1.5 million figure, saying there were
only 1.4 million Armenians living in Turkey at the turn of the
century. They claim that 300,000 Armenians were killed in the
turmoil of deportations and local reprisals. Historians have
estimated 600,000 dead.
   Armenia was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1920.
   ``Residents of Soviet Armenia today remembered the victims of
the 1915 genocide in which more than a million and a half innocent
people perished,'' Tass said.
   Special memorial services in Yerevan were attended by thousands
of people, including foreign specialists who are in the Armenian
capital doing relief work in the aftermath of the Dec. 7 earthquake
that killed 25,000 people, Tass said.
   On Tsitsernakerberd Hill, mourners ``laid flowers and wreaths to
the symbolic grave of their ancestors over which the eternal flame
has been glowing and sober music playing for many years,'' Tass
said.

   One of the jurors deliberating Iran-Contra
charges against Oliver North has high blood pressure and will be
examined by a doctor, the trial judge said today.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell identified the juror as
Jean Johnson and said she has been experiencing high blood pressure
during the jury deliberations, which began Friday.
   Mrs. Johnson is a 53-year-old cashier whose husband is disabled.
   ``I would like to arrange'' for a doctor to ``take a look at
her,'' Gesell said in court. She will be examined in the presence
of a deputy U.S. marshal.
   Meanwhile, Gesell said NBC News left unsigned letters at the
homes of jurors in the North case, inviting them to do interviews
after the trial is over. He said the letters had been picked up by
deputies from the U.S. Marshals Service.
   ``I think it's most inappropriate,'' said Gesell, ``quite
disrespectful of the situation we are dealing with.''
   Peggy Hubble, NBC network news spokeswoman in New York, said,
``The jurors are sequestered, so they're not at their homes. ...It
was intended for them to see them when they got home after they
made their decision after the trial, and the letter specifically
requested an interview after the trial.''
   She said the network was ``sorry if there was any inconvenience
or misinterpretation.''
   Meanwhile today, President Bush told reporters on a
cross-country trip that it was ``stupid'' and ``idiotic'' to
speculate about whether he would pardon North should the former
White House aide be convicted.
   Told that Newsweek magazine was quoting sources close to him as
predicting he would never pardon North, the president said:
``That's interesting speculation. It shows how stupid some reports
are. That matter has never been discussed with me by anyone,
including my wife.''
   He said ``it shows you how idiotic speculation is.''
   The jury resumed resumed deliberations today after a one-day
leisure break and quickly complained that ``we did not receive
paper clips'' they had requested Saturday.
   The note, sent to the judge, was the fourth to date. All
concerned office supplies: sharpened pencils, highlighters, note
pads.
   The nine women and three men were brought from their downtown
hotel in a van for their third day of meetings shortly before 9 a.m.
   The marshals taped television shows for them over the weekend
and cut out anything that might refer to the North trial or the
Iran-Contra affair. And the guards remained nearby while the jurors
spent a leisurely Sunday with their families to ensure that there
be no discussion about the case.
   Meanwhile today, an alternate juror, dismissed Thursday when the
case went to the jury, said on ``CBS This Morning'' that ``I just
felt for'' North.
   ``I had a sense that ... higher-ups was involved,'' Linda Brown
Clark said. Asked whether President Bush or former President Reagan
should have been asked to testify, she said:
   ``I think it might have helped, you know, to find out if they
was actually behind it ... or if they was telling him what to do
... if it was his job, you know. It would have been easier for him
and it might not even have come to trial if someone would have
spoke up.''
   North subpoenaed both Bush and Reagan. U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell set aside the Bush subpoena and quashed the one
for Reagan.
   North is charged with lying to Congress, illegally converting
$4,300 travelers' checks to hiw own use conspiring to commit tax
fraud in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The jurors spent about three hours in the jury room Saturday
before taking off the rest of the weekend. They are being housed in
a downtown hotel and are accompanied by marshals to make sure there
are no outside influences about the trial.
   The jurors are forbidden to talk about the case, even among
themselves, when they are not in deliberations. Their families were
allowed to visit them during Sunday's day off.
   North is charged with 12 criminal counts that include lying to
Congress, obstructing congressional and presidential inquiries, and
making personal use of Iran-Contra funds.
   Most of the charges carry penalties of five years in prison and
$250,000 fines upon conviction, with the total possible punishment
being 60 years and fines of $3 million.

<HEAD>New Ambassador Takes Over Amid Disagreements With West Germans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vernon A. Walters, a veteran diplomat
with a reputation for candor, took over as U.S. ambassador to West
Germany on Monday as the two nations try to work out thorny
disagreements.
   Walters refrained from mentioning one of the most pressing
issues ruffling U.S.-West German relations: short-range nuclear
weapons.
   But Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher heightened debate on
that issue by insisting Washington change its mind and begin early
negotiations with the Soviets on reducing the short-range weapons.
   A military honor guard welcomed Walters at Villa Hammerschmidt,
the palatial residence of President Richard von Weizsaecker.
Walters entered the villa without talking to reporters.
   Walters is viewed as more experienced and outspoken than his
predecessor, Richard Burt, and West German observers have predicted
that could heighten disputes between the two countries.
   In a copy of an address by Walters to von Weizsaecker during the
ceremonies in which he officially became ambassador, Walters
refrained from directly mentioning the short-range missiles.
   But he said NATO's nuclear weapons must be kept up to date and
warned against any move to abandon the weapons as a key part of the
alliance's defense strategy.
   ``At a time when East-West relations are changing for the
better, NATO will still continue to require conventional and
nuclear forces that are effective and credible,'' said Walters.
   Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg flew to
Washington on Monday to state their case for talks on the
short-range weapons even though U.S. officials a day earlier
indicated they won't be changing their position.
   Officials in Bonn also want NATO to postpone making a decision
to modernize the short-range weapons.
   The United States fears new negotiations might lead to
elimination of the weapons and says that would increase the threat
to Western Europe from superior Warsaw Pact conventional forces.
   Before leaving for Washington, Genscher said NATO already has
decided there should be negotiations on the short-range arsenals
and that this decision should be carried out.
   ``We would like to see this intention put into practice,''
Genscher said on Deutschlandfunk radio.
   In his address, Walters referred to some other issues that have
troubled U.S.-West German relations, such as complaints by West
Germans of NATO ground and air maneuvers.
   There has been increasing resentment among West Germans to the
400,000 foreign troops stationed on their soil amid a growing
perception that the Soviet bloc is no longer a military threat.
   But U.S. officials have warned that NATO cannot afford to let
its guard down and new developments in the East bloc _ such as
disarmament initiatives _ should be viewed with caution.
   On the issue of NATO maneuvers, Walters said ``I well understand
that the presence of nearly 1 million soldiers, German and allied
... means a special burden for the German population.''
   He added, ``We are working continually with your government to
seek ways to minimize the disruption of the daily lives of Germans.
We will continue to do this.''
   Walters did not mention what those measures were.
   The 72-year-old Walters last served as chief U.S. delegate at
the United Nations.

   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to grant
deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda,
access to most of their alleged vast wealth.
   The justices, without comment, rejected the Marcoses' appeal to
overturn a court order freezing their assets.
   Left intact is a ruling that also requires the couple to defend
themselves in a lawsuit filed by the Philippine government.
   The suit is one of several legal battles _ civil and criminal _
facing the ailing Marcos, 71, and his wife, 59.
   Marcos is being treated in a Honolulu hospital for heart and
respiratory ailments. U.S. prosecutors have conceded he is too ill
to stand trial on criminal charges but are proceeding with a
criminal case against Mrs. Marcos.
   A federal grand jury last year indicted the couple and six
others on racketeering charges, saying that they looted more than
$100 million from the Philippines to buy art and real estate in New
York City.
   The appeal turned down Monday by the Supreme Court is in a case
separate from the criminal charges. It stems from a suit filed by
the Philippine government of Corazon Aquino in federal court in
California after the Marcoses were exiled to Hawaii in 1986, ending
Marcos' 20-year rule.
   The Aquino government's suit against the Marcoses and an aide,
Ramon Azurin, seeks $50 billion in punitive damages.
   The Marcoses are accused of taking billions of dollars in public
money and using it for their personal benefit.
   A federal judge refused to throw out the suit, and that ruling
was upheld in December by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The appeals court rejected arguments that acts by a former head
of a foreign nation are outside the jurisdiction of American courts.
   Deposed dictators ``will find it difficult to deploy the
(head-of-state) defense successfully. Our courts have had no
difficulty in distinguishing the legal acts of a deposed ruler from
his acts for personal profit that lack a basis in law,'' the
appeals court said.
   The Aquino government says it has statements from Swiss bank
authorities that Marcos and his family have accounts there worth
more than $1.5 billion.
   The 9th Circuit court also upheld a federal judge's order that
bars the Marcoses from using any of their assets except to pay
their lawyers and for daily living expenses.
   The appeals court said the injuction was ``imperative'' to
prevent the Marcoses from ``putting their property beyond the
reach'' of the U.S. courts. ``Hardship to the (Philippine) Republic
would have been great and irreparable,'' the appeals court said, if
the judge had not taken ``prudent, amply justified action to keep
the Marcoses' assets from disappearing.''

<HEAD>World's Rarest Rhinos Found In War-Ravaged Region Of Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small population of the world's rarest
rhinoceros has been found in a war-ravaged region of Vietnam not
far from Ho Chi Minh City, officials said Monday.
   The Javan rhinoceros somehow survived decades of war and
defoliation in the eastern part of Vietnam's Song Be province, said
George Schaller, director of Wildlife Conservation International, a
division of the New York Zoological Society.
   The rhinos had been thought extinct in Vietnam since the 1960s,
except for about 50 living on the western tip of the island of Java.
   ``It was suspected that some still survived in Indochina, but
there was no definite evidence of them,'' Schaller said in a
telephone interview.
   The dark gray Javan rhinoceros is roughly similar to the African
black rhinoceros, but is chunkier and has heavy skin folds that
give it an armored look. An adult weighs 3,500 pounds, stands 5{
feet tall and is up to 11{ feet long.
   Live animals themselves were not sighted, but a dead one was
found and there were fresh tracks, Schaller said.
   The size of the rhino population is not known, but ``my guess
would be no more than 10 to 15,'' Schaller said.
   Schaller, who has tracked endangered animals all over the globe,
most recently in China and Tibet, found the rhinos' tracks during
an expedition to Vietnam in February and March.
   He was there with Vo Thanh Son of the University of Hanoi and
Nguyen Yuan Dang and Le Dinh Thuy of Vietnam's national research
council to make the first wildlife survey of Vietnam's southern
forests.
   The tracks were found along the Dong Nai River, about 75 miles
northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   The find is important not only because it improves the survival
odds for the Javan rhinoceros, but also because the rhinos can be
used to encourage preservation of wilderness in Vietnam, Schaller
said.
   ``You may well say that the rhino is a national treasure of
Vietnam,'' he said. ``But the real treasure is the habitat there,
the forest.
   ``Many of these ... charismatic species are in effect symbols,
flagship species, in that they arouse emotions. They motivate a
government to protect an area, because they get popular support.''
   The region where the rhinos were found is a hot, humid patchwork
of forest, native tribesmen's fields and huge expanses of bamboo up
to 40 feet tall, Schaller said.
   ``The Vietnamese are real conscious of conservation, and I think
they'll make an effort'' to protect the rhinos, Schaller said.
   He recommended stiff penalties for killing rhinos and selling
them, and the enlargement of a wilderness reserve near where the
rhinoceroses were found. In Vietnam, as elsewhere in Asia, rhino
horn is used as a constituent of many different medicines, he said.

<DATELINE>ABOARD THE BARONESS M (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capt. Dionysis Palanicoloatos took
his ferry toward the coast of Lebanon, where hundreds of people
were waiting to escape their daily dose of fear.
   With the big Baroness M just 25 miles away from the
battle-scarred Christian heartland, a call came in from the ship's
agent in the port of Jounieh.
   Turn around and go back, the agent told the skipper.
   ``It's frustrating not to go in after coming all this way, but
we can't put anybody at risk,'' Papanicolatos, a 45-year-old Greek,
said as he turned the vessel around Sunday.
   What the agent did not say is that a French tanker was
delivering much-needed fuel oil to the Christian enclave north of
Beirut. Earlier, it made a similiar shipment to the Moslem sector.
   The Christian cabinet, led by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun,
had ordered the ferry service suspended while the fuel was unloaded
at Journieh, which has been the target of steady shelling by Syrian
forces.
   The interrupted journey of the Baroness M was a momentary cut in
the only escape route for the beleaguered Christian residents,
whose enclave is surrounded on three sides by hostile forces and
the fourth by the sea.
   The Baroness M is one of two Cyprus-based ferries making the
regular 112-mile trip from the island nation to Lebanon. They have
carried out an estimated 13,000 Christian refugees in the past six
weeks as fighting between Christian forces and Syrian and Druse
allied troops has intesified.
   In recent days, the ferries have had to anchor outside Lebanon's
12-mile territorial waters because of the Syrian shelling.
   Papanicolatos had planned to move in to within 15 miles to pick
up around 1,000 Christians coming out of fishing boats under cover
of darkness if the shelling didn't look too bad.
   But the way it turned out, the Christian families were left
stranded, not knowing when they will be able to flee to safety.
   Leaving Lebanon can be as treacherous as living there. Shipping
sources in Larnaca, Cyprus, said a Syrian shell hit a fishing boat
carrying people to the other ferry, the Larnaca Rose, on Saturday
night. The sources said there were many fatalities.
   Sources in Jounieh said they had no information to authenticate
that report.
   But Artine Himidian, a Lebanese aboard one of the fishing
smacks, said: ``We were shelled all the way out to the Larnaca Rose.
   ``The skipper steered a zig-zag course so it would be more
difficult for the gunners' radar to track us ... Women and children
were screaming as the shells crashed around the boat,'' he said.
   Walid Barake, another of the Lebanese on the Larnaca Rose, said
he spent several hours hiding from the bombardment in a casino
basement in Jounieh before they managed to get to the ferry.
   He said about 4,000 Christians were waiting to be evacuated from
Jounieh, which the Syrians are shelling daily, to make the
nine-hour voyage to Cyprus.
   ``We were waiting for the bus to take us to a small port to get
on the fishing boat. The shells were falling almost continously,''
he said.
   About 70 passengers who left Larnaca aboard the Baroness M
Sunday morning, mostly businessmen going to Lebanon to see their
families, had to return to Cyprus.
   ``I don't how I'll get back to Beirut if the ships aren't
running. I'm worried about my wife, she gets very anxious in the
bombing,'' said Jean-Pierre Burat, a French national who runs a
shipping company in Beirut.
   Most passengers seemed relaxed as they sunbathed and chatted or
leafed through magazines. Some played blackjack for hours in the
ship's casino.
   As the Baroness M sailed off the southern coast of Cyprus, three
musicians played Lebanese songs and some passengers danced until
the early hours.
   ``It's always the same, they're sad for an hour, then they're
dancing,'' said purser Irma Hage.

<TEXT>
   An Israeli soldier in south Lebanon mistakenly
opened fire on cars from an Israeli-allied militia, nearly killing
militia commander Gen. Antoine Lahd, a military source said Monday.
   The shooting occurred Sunday night when a convoy of South
Lebanon Army cars driving at high speed neared an army patrol in
Israel's security zone above the border, an army spokeswoman said
on condition of anonymity.
   The commander of the Israeli patrol, believing he was under
guerrilla attack, fired several shots, first in the air and then at
the wheels of the approaching vehicles, she said.
   There were no casualties and the officer apologized to Lahd
after the shooting, she said.
   A military source said, however, that Lahd's car was damaged by
bullets that came close to hitting the militia leader.
   The shooting was in the central sector of the security zone,
Israel's self-proclaimed buffer strip along the border patroled by
Lahd's South Lebanon Army. The mainly Christian militia of about
2,500 men is trained and financed by Israel.
   The 6- to 10-mile-wide security zone was established by Israel
in 1985 when it pulled most of its forces out of the area, ending a
three-year occupation. About 1,000 Israeli soldiers reportedly are
still stationed in the Lebanese south.
   In November, the 61-year-old Lahd survived an assassination
attempt by his wife's 21-year-old dance instructor, who shot him in
the arm and chest at his home in Marjayoun in southern Lebanon.
   Lahd was released from an Israeli hospital in January, and his
assailant is still believed jailed by his militia in South Lebanon.

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Pleased with Progress of First 100 Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ESPO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday pronounced himself
``pleased with the progress we've made'' in 100 days in office and
said he will soon make key arms control and foreign policy
decisions that will chart a course for the future.
   ``In three short months we've made a good start coming to grips
with issues demanding urgent attention and decisive action,'' he
told newspaper publishers attending The Associated Press annual
luncheon.
   He ticked off his savings and loan legislation, ethics
proposals, the beginning of a war on drugs and agreements with
Congress on the federal budget and Contra aid.
   At the same time, he said defense and foreign policy reviews,
environmental legislation and a program to deal with homelessness
``are all on the near horizon.''
   Bush spoke at the luncheon a short while after Vice President
Dan Quayle told The Associated Press annual meeting that the
biggest surprise of his first 100 days in office is the enjoyment
he receives from foreign travel. The publishers who attended the AP
functions were also in town for the annual meetings of the American
Newspaper Publishers Association.
   Quayle, setting out on a trip to Australia and Asia, also said
he had an opportunity to work closely with the president every day
``to see how he formulates his policies.''
   The Bush-Quayle team took office on Jan. 20 and marks 100 days
on Saturday.
   Before reciting his own report card, Bush pledged to ``follow
every intelligence lead in the effort to win freedom for Terry
Anderson.'' The AP's chief Middle East correspondent has been held
hostage since disappearing in Beirut more than four years ago. The
president said he was not able to provide any good news on
Anderson's prospects for freedom, but said, ``We will go the extra
mile and do what we can.''
   Chicago was a brief stop and a long day for both Quayle and the
president. Bush started in Norfolk, Va., where he attended a
ceremony marking the deaths of 47 sailors killed in a gun turret
explosion aboard the USS Iowa last week. From Chicago he was flying
to Bismarck, N.D., and then on to California.
   ``We made a good start in these first three months and there's
more to come,'' the president told the AP luncheon.
   On his list of accomplishments, he touted the agreement with
Congress to provide non-lethal aid to the Contra rebels as well as
the broad-brush budget agreement that he said would reduce the
deficit while leaving his no-tax pledge intact.
   He urged the House to follow the Senate's lead in enacting his
legislation to bail out the savings and loan industry and noted he
had recommended stronger ethics legislation.
   He also cited his administration's war on drugs in the District
of Columbia and his decision to ban the import of certain
semiautomatic weapons as achievements in his first three months in
office.
   He also mentioned an initiative to deal with the problem of
Third World debt and his announcement last week of fresh help for
Poland.
   The president made no mention of any setbacks, and did not refer
to the Senate's defeat of former Texas Sen. John Tower to be
defense secretary.
   Looking to the future, the president said he would conclude a
broad defense and foreign policy review late next month. He
predicted a period of ``remarkable change in international affairs
_ change more wide-ranging and rapid than at any time in the
postwar period.''
   ``I have already made some decisions,'' he said. ``Others,
including on arms control, will be forthcoming soon,'' and he noted
that Secretary of State James A. Baker III would soon be meeting
with his Soviet counterpart.
   On other subjects the president said he would soon submit draft
legislation for a new Clean Air Act as well as new proposals to
deal with the increased use of lethal weapons by drug dealers and
new proposals to combat homelessness.
   He pledged continued consultation with Congress and said the
results of the last three months demonstrate ``the value of tough,
principled negotiations between this administration'' and the House
and Senate.
   Quayle devoted most of his remarks to his forthcoming trip to
Asia. He said the ``declinists'' who are predicting a diminished
standing for the United States will be proven wrong, just as they
were in the 1950s when the Soviet Union orbited the first earth
satellite.
   ``The point that I will stress to my Asian hosts is that when
Americans express doubts about the health of American society, it's
usually a sign of renewal, not of decline,'' he said.

<HEAD>Safety Board Looking Into Southern California Air Traffic Control</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety officials will consider changes
in air traffic control for much of southern California on Tuesday,
after investigation of incidents in which airplanes were flown too
close to each other.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is meeting to consider
the results and recommendations from a staff investigation into the
``loss of standard separation'' between a British Airways jumbo jet
and an American Airlines jetliner on Feb. 13 over Westminster,
Calif.
   The planes came within 1.9 miles of each other, both at 9,000
feet, and Federal Aviation Administration officials at the time
said the British Airways pilot had to make a hasty turn to avoid a
collision.
   Although the planes were not close enough for the incident to be
considered a ``near miss,'' FAA rules say they should have been at
least three miles apart horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   The British jet, a Boeing 747, was carrying 286 people from Los
Angeles to London. The American Airlines plane, a British Aerospace
146 with 70 people aboard, was landing at Ontario International
Airport after being diverted from John Wayne International Airport
at Santa Ana, which had been closed due to a power failure.
   The investigation was expanded to cover seven other operational
errors over the past year at the Coast Terminal Radar Approach
Control Facility at John Wayne. The traffic control operation
handles about half a million flights a year in the area between Los
Angeles and San Diego, one of the busiest flight areas in the
country outside major airport control zones.
   The safety board's inquiry is its first major investigation into
an air traffic control operation since it recommended upgrading at
Chicago's O`Hare International Airport after operational errors
increased in 1986. O'Hare had more than 30 flight-handling errors
in 1988, and the FAA has ordered several changes, including the
hiring of additional controllers.
   The staff report on the Feb. 13 California incident recommends
several changes at the Santa Ana facility.
   Among proposals to be voted on by the board are increases in
staffing and training of personnel, some improvements and expansion
of the facility itself and several technical changes, according to
a board source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The board meeting on Southern California air traffic control
problems comes two days after two reported near collisions
involving airliners in the New York area.
   A TWA jumbo jet coming in from London and a commuter plane were
reported to have come within about 100 feet as they approached
Kennedy International Airport on Sunday, and 45 minutes later a Pan
Am Boeing 727 en route from LaGuardia Airport to Boston reported
coming within 400 yards of a small plane near Westchester County
Airport.
   The five-member board could expand its recommendations to cover
other facilities if it decides any problem is widespread, but only
conditions at the Santa Ana facility are on the agenda.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of violent crimes rose 5 percent
last year, the FBI said Monday, with aggravated assaults up 7
percent.
   The FBI's preliminary Uniform Crime Report for 1988 showed
overall that reported crimes rose 3 percent from 1987 to 1988.
   Murders increased 3 percent and robberies were up 4 percent from
1987, according to the statistics released Sunday. Rapes went up 1
percent and motor vehicle thefts increased 11 percent.
   Despite the general rise in killings, the number of murders
declined in three of the nation's largest cities.
   Homicides reported to police dropped 8.8 percent in Los Angeles,
4.4 percent in Chicago and 8.3 percent in Detroit.
   Murders rose 64 percent in Washington, where authorities are
blaming the dramatic increase in killings on warring drug dealers.
   The Bush administration has detailed extra FBI and Drug
Enforcement Administration agents to the nation's capital to help
local police fight the drug-spawned crime wave.
   Murders increased 36 percent in Houston, 27.8 percent in
Indianapolis; 27 percent in Jacksonville, Fla.; 21.6 percent in
Memphis, Tenn.; 13.3 percent in New York City, and 12.9 percent in
Dallas, the report said.
   Murders were up 9.7 percent in Philadelphia and 4.8 percent in
Atlanta.
   Pittsburgh recorded a 51 percent decline in murders reported to
police.
   A 3 percent rise in crime last year followed a 2 percent
increase between 1986 and 1987 and a 6 percent jump between 1985
and 1986, the report said.
   The crime index records the number of selected crimes reported
to state and local police agencies. The FBI also tallies the number
of burglaries, larcenies, motor vehicle thefts and arsons reported
to authorities.
   Final tabulations for 1988 are expected to be released this
summer, the FBI said.
   The index showed reported crimes increased 4 percent in the
Northeast and the South and 3 percent in the West. There was no
change in the Midwest crime index, the bureau said.
   By region, murders were up 11 percent in the Northeast, 4
percent in the South and 1 percent in the West.
   There was a 3 percent decline in the number of murders in the
Midwest.
   Small cities showed a 7 percent jump in violent crime, including
an 8 percent increase in rapes and a 6 percent increase in
aggravated assault. Homicides, however, dropped 7 percent in
smaller cities, the report said.
   Cities with populations over 50,000 reported a 5 percent hike in
violent crime and a 6 percent increase in murders.
   Arson increased 1 percent. A 3 percent incease in larger cities
was offset by declines elsewhere.

   About 1.5 million workers nationwide
staged a 24-hour general strike Monday over wages, closing ports
and factories and halting bus service.
   Police were deployed outside government buildings to keep the
peace. Workers marched in the capital's commerical district.
   The workers sought a cost-of-living increase of 60 percent; they
have rejected a government offer of a 10 percent increase that was
scheduled to begin in July.
   Police said there were no reports of violence in the strike,
which was called by a group representing more than 20 trade unions
nationwide.
   In the southern ports of Chittagong and Khulna, loading and
unloading was stalled but ship movement was maintained, officials
said.
   Dhaka public transport employees did not show up for work and
many people kept off the streets fearing violence, the United News
of Bangladesh reported. Tricycle rickshaws, which were allowed to
operate after midday, were almost the only transport on the roads,
according to Nurul Islam, president of the Trade Union Center.
   But government officials said public transportation was not
substantially affected by the strike.
   ``Trains, ferry and air services were almost normal and road
transport was partially disrupted in the morning,'' said Syed
Deedar Bakth, the information minister.
   Islam said the only factories that remained open were some in
Demra and Khulna.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision to develop both the
MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles drew a mixed reaction Monday on
Capitol Hill with some lawmakers faulting the administration for
failing to make a choice while others called the plan the next-best
option.
   ``It's the same thing _ the `all of the above' choice,'' said
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee. ``They never have the guts to make a decision.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had recommended moving the
nation's 50 multiple-warhead, MX missiles from silos to deployment
on railroad cars rather than developing the single-warhead
Midgetman. But Bush opted for quick deployment of the MX and
research-and-development for the Midgetman.
   Congressional Republicans over the years have favored the MX
while many Democrats prefer the Midgetman.
   Cheney, in a television interview Sunday, announced the
president's decision as well as administration plans to cut
spending on Star Wars to $4.6 billion from the $5.9 billion
proposed by former President Reagan for fiscal 1990 and a proposal
to delay work on the B-2 stealth bomber.
   The defense secretary is expected to detail the cuts Tuesday
when he appears before the House Armed Services Committee.
   The ranking Republican on that panel, Rep. Bill Dickinson of
Alabama, said he urged Bush and Cheney to choose the MX and ignore
the Midgetman, but they felt they had to ``placate the liberal
Democrats and keep this thing alive,'' he said.
   ``The main thing is to preserve and protect the assets we got
which is MX in silos, and then go forward and make them mobile,''
said Dickinson, who described the MX-Midgetman decision as his
``second choice.''
   But another Republican, Sen. Pete Wilson of California, said he
was disappointed with Bush's decision, citing the cost of
research-and-development of the Midgetman.
   Pentagon officials have indicated that funding for the Midgetman
would come out of the MX budget, which is $2.4 billion in the
current proposal.
   ``This will be the fourth year in a row that the defense budget
has been cut in real terms,'' said Wilson, a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee. ``... Further development of the
Midgetman wastes funds that are sorely needed for other defense
programs.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the
committee and a backer of the proposal, said it was his opinion the
plan ``will move through the Hill reasonably, smoothly,'' because
of its support in both parties.
   ``Sen. Nunn and I and Congressman Aspin have been of like mind
on this issue. It goes way back to last year when the three of us
urged President Reagan to retain enough money in the budget'' so
Bush could make a choice, said Warner.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., is chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., is chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee.
   Warner said the decision now on the MX and Midgetman avoided a
``serious deadlock'' that would have left other defense-related
issues unresolved.
   ``It's the axle around which other decisions will be made,''
Warner said.

   President Hussain Muhammad Ershad on
Monday ordered his people to pray for rain to end a 2-month-old
drought that has wiped out much of the country's important rice
crop.
   Ershad's order calls for 15 minutes of mass prayers to be held
nationwide Wednesday on playgrounds and in mosques, said press
secretary Toab Khan.
   The drought that has parched Bangladesh follows heavy floods
late last year that submerged three-fourths of the nation and
killed hundreds of people.
   Ershad plans to attend the prayer session of Dhaka's main Moslem
congregation. An estimated 100,000 people are to recite verses from
the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   Rains, which were expected around the first week of March, are
not likely for another week, the weather office said.
   The drought has destroyed rice crop in more than 15 districts in
northern Bangladesh, the most severely affected area, officials at
the Agriculture Ministry said.
   Nearly half of the Boro variety rice crop will be lost this
season, said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He
said the loss may multiply if the drought persists.
   The country annually produces 17 million tons of foodgrains to
feed its 110 million people. The target of Boro rice crop this year
was set at 4.6 million tons.
   Crops in Bangladesh depend mostly on rains for irrigation. Some
areas have irrigation pumps but most were dry as groundwater levels
had plunged, news reports said.
   Bangladesh imports about 2 million tons of foodgrains a year to
meet the shortfall of 1.5 million tons in production and build an
emergency reserve.
   The drought followed devastating floods last year that claimed
more than 1,400 lives and washed away about 2.5 million tons of
grain.
   The floods forced the government to plan an import of 3 million
tons of food grains this year and the drought-induced loss may push
the imports further up, the Agriculture Ministry said.
   Crop losses has sparked a steep hike in food prices in several
remote areas of northern Bangladesh, United News of Bangladesh news
agency said.
   But the government ruled out a possibility of famine saying it
had a reserve stock of more than 800,000 tons of food grains.
   Two years of natural disasters have inflicted damage totalling
$1.1 billion in damage to the country, according to a joint
estimate by the United Nations and Aid Group for Bangladesh.
   The aid group, at a meeting Wednesday in Paris, committed $2.2
billion in new aid for fiscal year 1990 to Bangladesh. Donors
include Britain, France, Japan, the United Nations, the
International Monetary Fund and the United Nations Development
Program.

   Foreign doctors challenged a Soviet diagnosis that
children in a Ukrainian city lost their hair after being exposed to
a chemical used in rat poisons, Tass reported Monday.
   Dr. Gerar de Groot of the Toxicological Center in the
Netherlands told the official news agency the quantities of
thallium found in patients could not have caused the reported
consequences. But he and other experts said they did not know what
made more than 160 children in the city of Chernovtsy to lose their
hair since autumn.
   In February, Tass quoted Soviet doctors as saying the chemical
might have been carried to the city in the form of acid rain from a
nearby Romanian chemical plant. Chernovtsy is near the Soviet
border with Romania.
   As a result, town streets were washed more frequently, and only
local drivers were allowed into the city center. Traffic was banned
altogether one day a week, Tass reported in February.
   The mysterious ailment, the last case of which was discovered in
November, afflicted primarily children under 14, Tass said. The
children suffered no long-term health effects, the agency quoted a
doctor as saying.

<HEAD>Sulzberger: Press Should Focus on Illiteracy, `National Disgrace'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newspaper industry, suffering from falling
readership, must ``shine a journalistic spotlight'' on illiteracy,
New York Times Co. Chairman Arthur Ochs Sulzberger told a
publishers' meeting Monday.
   But Sulzberger, outgoing chairman of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association, said in a keynote speech to the ANPA's
103rd annual meeting that the long-run battle must be waged by
school boards, state legislatures and governors.
   ``Let us shine a journalistic spotlight on the problems and
focus our citizens' attention on a national disgrace,'' said
Sulzberger, speaking in a city whose schools were labeled the
nation's worst by former Education Secretary William Bennett.
   ``Let us hold those who claim to be accountable to account,''
Sulzberger added.
   Sulzberger's address kicked off the three-day meeting of the
nation's newspaper executives, who also heard Monday from President
Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle. The president and vice
president spoke as part of the annual meeting of The Associated
Press, held in conjunction with the ANPA.
   Sulzberger called on publishers to make their newspapers
attractive to readers.
   ``If the product isn't compelling, if the reader doesn't need
it, then there is little that your association can do to help,'' he
said.
   In his wide-ranging address, Sulzberger touched n several other
issues facing the newspaper industry, including racial imbalance in
the workforce and declining markets and advertising.
   A recent survey found that only 7 percent of newspaper managers
and executives come from minority ranks. The ANPA and other groups
have tried to change that, he said, citing an ANPA hotline to make
minority applicants aware of jobs.
   ``We're not yet running, but we have passed the baby-step years
and our industry goal of racial diversity throughout our workforce
would seem at last to be attainable,'' he said.
   The 63-year-old publisher of the New York Times also sounded a
call for a strong, independent free press, citing hysteria over
``The Satanic Verses.''
   The novel by British author Salman Rushdie was ``almost
incomprehensible,'' but the response of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini and other critics was ``terrifying,'' Sulzberger said.
   Khomeini, declaring the novel blasphemous, called for Rushdie's
death.
   ``Undoubtedly the book is offensive to many Moslems,''
Sulzberger said. But he told more than 800 people during a morning
session that civilized people ``have long abandoned burning at the
stake as a response to blasphemy.
   ``This is 1989, not 1589,'' he said.
   ``We need your help in maintaining a strong and independent free
press,'' Sulzberger told the group.

   Director Steven Spielberg and actress Amy
Irving have decided to divorce, ending months of speculation that
their 3{-year marriage was on the rocks.
   ``The settlement agreements have already been amicably reached
by both Ms. Irving and Mr. Spielberg,'' publicist Robert G.
Friedman said Monday while issuing a statement from the couple.
   ``We have decided to make this statement public in order to
protect the privacy of our family, which is of great importance to
us,'' the statement said. Supermarket tabloids have speculated on a
split for months.
   ``Our mutual decision, however difficult, has been made in the
spirit of caring. And our friendship remains both personal and
professional,'' the statement concluded.
   Spielberg, 40, and Miss Irving, 35, were married in November
1985 in a private civil ceremony in Santa Fe, N.M. They have a
3-year-old son, Max.
   Details on child custody arrangements and division of property
weren't disclosed, said Friedman.
   Among Spielberg's hit films as a director or producer are
``Jaws,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Raiders of the
Lost Ark,'' ``E.T. _ The Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``Empire of the
Sun,'' ``The Color Purple'' and ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit.''
   Ms. Irving's movie credits included ``Honeysuckle Rose,''
``Crossing Delancey'' and she was nominated for a supporting
actress Oscar in ``Yentl.''

<HEAD>State Department Urges Open-Minded Attitude to Palestinian Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States on Monday urged Israelis and
Palestinians to keep open minds about an evolving plan for
elections in the Israeli-occupied territories and to stop a recent
escalation of violence between them.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States is deeply concerned over the increase in casualties over the
past few days in clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinians
protesting Israel's rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``The increase in tensions runs directly counter to the cause of
peace,'' she said. ``We strongly urge both sides to exercise
restraint. We remain determined to work with all parties to break
out of the current confrontation and to replace violence with
political dialogue and accommodation.''
   Discussing the possibility of Palestinian elections as a first
step toward a peace settlement, Ms. Tutwiler said the United States
will work closely with all parties in the region.
   The goal, she said, is to create conditions for direct
negotiations and peace.
   ``If elections are to fulfill their potential in this regard, it
will be essential that they be free and fair in the best tradition
of democracy. All those truly committed to peace should demonstrate
that commitment by keeping an open mind to proposals that can
advance the process,'' she said.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has proposed a plan for
elections in the West Bank and Gaza to choose Palestinians to
negotiate an interim peace treaty with Israel.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has been reported to have
countered with a proposal for elections in the occupied lands for
members of the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile.
   Shamir says Israel will never hold talks with the PLO but
several Labor Party ministers recently have urged a change in that
stand.
   Tutwiler cautioned that discussions of an election format had
just begun in the Middle East, following presentation of the plan
to the Bush administration during Shamir's visit here this month.
   ``Obviously, during the course of these discussions, there will
be many and varied views on the issue, some workable, some not,''
she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler also defended the State Department against
accusations by some Lebanese Christian leaders and U.S. editorials
that the United States is ignoring the suffering in Lebanon.
   She said the government has for the past two years been
supplying $14 million in food annually to some 135,000 Lebanese
families, both Christian and Moslem, although supplies have been
interrupted by the heavy Syrian bombardments of Christian enclaves
in Beirut in recent weeks.
   President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III have
issued several statements expressing their concern over the
deteriorating situation in Lebanon, she said, and Baker attended a
church service Sunday in Washington ``to show his support for the
suffering of the people in Lebanon.''
   The fact that the United States has not sent ships or personnel
to Lebanon, as France has done, ``does not mean that the United
States does not care,'' she said.

   Contra rebels and Nicaraguan opposition
parties asked the United Nations on Monday to send monitors to
ensure that the presidential campaign is democratic.
   The leftist Sandinista government made its own request on March
16 that the international body send poll-watchers for the election,
set for Feb. 25, 1990.
   The government agreed to the elections and other democratic
reforms last February in a pact among five Central American
presidents. In exchange, the leaders said they would arrive at a
plan by mid-May to disband the Contras.
   Spokesmen for the rebels and the political opposition, which
ranges from conservative to communist, said they made their request
Monday during a 2{-hour meeting with Alvaro de Soto, an aide to
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Joining the Contra envoys were officials from the Social
Democratic Party, Conservative Party, Conservative Party of
Nicaragua, Conservative Democratic Party, Socialist Party, Social
Christian Party, the Private Enterprise Council, and the Communist
Party, which is separate from the Sandinistas.
   Contra leader Aristedes Sanchez said the rebels, who are armed
and living in camps in neighboring Honduras, and the opposition
groups would honor the results of ``a free election.''
   However, the two groups said they still had misgivings about the
attitude of the leftist Sandinista government in Managua.
   The rebels and political opposition have been suspicious about
whether the Sandinistas will allow the national election commission
and the country's news media to function impartially.
   The Sandinista Party controls both the government and the media
in Nicaragua.
   However, the rebels and political leaders on Monday expressed
their commitment to participate in the election.
   ``This is an opportunity to rebuild the nation,'' said Bosco
Matamoros, another Contra leader.
   The Contra and Nicaraguan political leaders did not discuss
specific proposals after their meeting with de Soto.
   But they said they want the United Nations to verify that the
campaign is free and fair. Matamoros stressed what he called ``the
necessity of international support, guarantees and verification.''
   Perez de Cuellar has said his aides are reviewing whether to
send observers to Nicaragua. He has notified the General Assembly
to be ready to approve funds if the mission is approved.
   About 12,000 Contra fighters are believed to be in Honduran
border camps. U.S. military aid to the Contras ended 11 months ago,
and they now receive only humanitarian aid.
   In April, the Contras declared a truce until the February
elections.

<TEXT>
   The mother ship in Japan's controversial research
whaling fleet returned home to a quiet welcome Monday after a
four-month hunt in the Antarctic, where it dodged protesters' boats
to kill 241 whales.
   About 20 whaling officials and Parliament members greeted the
Nisshin Maru No. 3's 120 crew members at a ceremony on its long
main deck.
   ``Your whaling is crucial for maintaining Japan's food
culture,'' Tatsuo Shinmori, a Parliament member, told the crew.
``You struggled against the protesters, and now we should follow
your example by doing our best to protect whaling.''
   Stored beneath the ship's 23,000-ton deck was the meat from 241
Minke whales, already processed by a shipboard factory. Scientists
estimate stocks of Minke whales at between 400,000 and 700,000.
   In the early 1960s, whales provided 23 percent of all meat
consumed in Japan. But declining supplies have turned it into a
delicacy, and the Nisshin Maru, with its rusty, paint-marked sides,
is the only remaining mother ship.
   Japan, still the world's largest consumer of whale meat,
officially stopped whaling commercially in 1987, following a
worldwide ban by the International Whaling Commission.
   But the ban allows so-called research whaling, under which
countries can capture whales to test stocks, then may consume the
meat. The research is to see whether there are sufficient stocks of
some species to allow limited commercial whaling when the ban is
re-evaluated in 1990.
   International environmental groups such as Greenpeace have
charged that Japan is using the research provision as a ploy to
continue whaling, and that alternative non-lethal research methods
are available.
   Greenpeace members used a ship and rubber rafts to try to block
the Nisshin Maru and its three catcher boats from whaling in the
Antarctic waters, and collided once with the mother ship.
   ``There's a basic difference between us in ideology and
philosophy _ they want to protect all whales _ so a conflict is
inevitable,'' said Hidehiro Kato, director of research on the
Nisshin Maru.
   ``I'd prefer to use non-lethal methods, but they don't tell us
age, reproductive status or condition of the whales,'' he said.
``At this point, the best approach is a combination of lethal and
non-lethal research.''
   Japanese whaling officials initially said at least 825 whales
had to be caught each season to make the research program
scientifically accurate. But following strong international
opposition, they reduced this year's goal to 300.
   Kato said the fleet did not reach the goal primarily because of
bad weather, but that the Greenpeace protests ``had some effect.''
   Crew member Hideyoshi Yoshida said he was in a catcher boat that
narrowly missed being hit by the Greenpeace ship.
   ``The research whaling was approved by the Japanese government,
so I wish people opposed to it would discuss it with the
government, rather than confronting us while we're whaling,'' he
said.

   A judge acquitted a union
leader and four other black activists of subversion Monday,
describing boycotts they organized as legal protests of poor living
conditions.
   Jubilant supporters lifted Moses Mayekiso, leader of a metal
workers' union, on their shoulders and carried him from the Supreme
Court to the nearby Central Methodist Church.
   Police ordered the crowd to stop singing and chanting. They also
told journalists to leave the area.
   Mayekiso said at a news conference later he and the other his
defendants would resume their activities and rebuild the community
organizations authorities had alleged were subversive.
   ``We're going to start where we left,'' Mayekiso said. ``The
message we have been given is that the structures are legal.''
   Mayekiso, 48, was charged with attempting a political takeover
in 1985-86 of Alexandra, an impoverished black township adjoining
some of Johannesburg's most luxurious white suburbs.
   He had been jailed for 30 months until Judge P.J. van der Walt
freed him on bail in December.
   Van der Walt said Monday the state presented no direct evidence
that the defendants, their Alexandra Action Committee or the
outlawed African National Congress had planned unrest, attacks on
police, the resignation of township council members or the
establishment of people's courts.
   The judge said he had toured the township and seen the poor
conditions. He said the community had developed a lack of faith and
trust in authorities.
   According to van der Walt, the boycotts were intended to improve
living conditions, not make the township ungovernable.
   International attention was attracted to the trial because
because Mayekiso leads the National Union of Metalworkers of South
Africa, the country's largest union of metal workers, and because
many activists viewed the prosecution as an attempt to stifle
peaceful anti-apartheid activity.
   In the United States, United Auto Workers president Owen Bieber
called the prosecution ``malicious and outrageous.''
   ``The South African authorities knew all along that Mayekiso had
committed no crime, but they jailed him for 901 days and subjected
him to a long and costly trial,'' Bieber said in a statement.
   Van der Walt criticized the state for first charging the
defendants with treason. After acknowledging treason could not be
proved, prosecutors substituted the lesser charges of subversion
and sedition.
   In the trial, van der Walt asked the prosecutor whether rent and
consumer boycotts were illegal in 1985-6. The prosecutor
acknowledged they were not, but the government has imposed
emergency decrees since that outlaw the organization of boycotts.
   During that period in Alexandra, dozens of people were killed in
clashes with security forces and in attacks by crowds on township
council members and black policemen. The entire council resigned
and most black policemen moved out of Alexandra.
   Since then, the government has detained or restricted leaders of
the Alexandra Action Committee and undertaken a $45 million
redevelopment program to provide sewage, electricity and paved
streets to most of the 100,000 residents.
   Those acquitted with Mayekiso were Paul Tshabalala, 38; Obed
Bapela, 30; Richard Mdakane, 30, and Mayekiso's brother, Mzwanele,
24.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Zaid Rifai and his
government resigned Monday because of riots over price increases
imposed as part of an austerity program. King Hussein did not name
a successor immediately.
   In an official statement read on state television, Hussein
called for ``a comprehensive national review'' that would ``make
each citizen feel we are in a period of complete reorganization.''
   He did not say when a replacement would be named for Rifai, a
52-year-old boyhood friend of the king who was educated in the
United States and had been prime minister since 1985.
   Hussein assigned secretaries-general of government ministries,
second in rank to appointed ministers, to run their departments
until a new government is formed.
   Four days of riots in which at least nine people were killed
began April 18 in the southern city of Maan and spread to dozens of
cities and towns. Many rioters called for Rifai's ouster but also
shouted support for the king.
   Officials said the toll rose to nine with the death Monday
evening of an air force major shot during riots in the town of
Mazar.
   Many Jordanians blame the prime minister for declining living
standards. Annual per capita income has fallen from $2,000 in the
mid-1980s to about $1,200.
   Last year, the government imposed import controls and austerity
measures to help deal meet payments on a foreign debt of $6 billion.
   Riots were precipitated by price increases of 10 percent to 50
percent on gasoline, cigarettes and other goods decreed as part of
a debt-rescheduling plan worked out with the International Monetary
Fund.
   The king, who cut short a foreign tour, expressed his intention
Sunday ``to deal with the roots of the problem and all the causes
and reasons ... within a short period of time,'' the official
Jordan News Agency reported.
   Hussein appeared to refer to the rioters' complaints when he
urged the secretaries-general in his statement to ``put an end to
abuse and misuse,'' but also praised Rifai and his government for
``carrying your responsibilites with honesty and your honest
efforts to achieve the goals we set for our country.''
   He hinted that economic belt-tightening would continue, but also
at an effort to spread the impact of the hardships.
   ``We have to divide the responsibility and the burden until we
stand solidly on our feet,'' Hussein said.
   No Jordanian prime minister has served longer than Rifai since
independence from Britain in 1946. Besides the term that began in
April 1985, he also was prime minister from 1973 to 1976.
   Educated at Columbia and Harvard, Rifai earlier served as
ambassador to Britain and as chief of the royal court.
   His father, Samir, served six terms as prime minister in the
1940s, 1950s and 1960s, for a total of less than four years.
   Last week's eruption of violence was the worst in Jordan since
the army crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1971.
   Various Jordanian groups have demanded reforms, new economic
policies, parliamentary elections and action against official
corruption.
   More than 100 people have been arrested in recent days to
prevent further demonstrations, said Laith Shubeilat, head of the
Council of Presidents of Jordan's professional associations.
   He said most were Communist Party members, but several members
of the Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of
Palestine also were arrested. He said others outside of those
groups, including former parliamentary deputy Riad Nawaiseh of
Kerak, were also arrested.
   Shubeilat said the associations planned to send a cable to the
king urging the government to withdraw an arrest warrant against
George Haddadin, head of the Geologists Union and a member of the
Democratic Front of Jordan, allied to the Marxist Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine.
   Haddadin said he believed he was wanted because he was among the
association leaders who signed a petition to the palace Saturday
calling for a new elected government.

   A federal judge on Monday blocked the District
of Columbia's curfew law from taking effect for at least 10 days
because of questions about its constitutionality.
   The curfew, passed by the city council April 4 in an attempt to
keep youths from becoming involved in drugs and crime, had been set
to start at 11 p.m. EDT Monday and continue for 90 days.
   ``There are serious First, Fourth and Fifth Amendment concerns
raised in this issue,'' U.S. District Judge Charles H. Richey said
before issuing a temporary restraining order, which he said he
would extend for another 10 days if necessary.
   ``I'm happy today. My clients are happy today,'' said Arthur B.
Spitzer, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union,
representing 15 young people who contended the curfew threatens
their constitutional rights.
   ``This law will do essentially nothing to solve the problem of
drugs in the district, while having harmful effects on the rights
of our youth,'' he said. ``There is no reason to put juveniles
under house arrest every night,'' he added.
   The judge said he would hold a hearing in the near future to
reach a final decision on the curfew law.
   Richey struck down the city's original curfew law on March 20.
   The latest version, while still requiring those under age 18 to
be off the city's streets, sidewalks and other public areas by 11
p.m. Sunday through Thursday and midnight Friday and Saturday,
contains several exceptions.
   Exempt from the curfew would be minors accompanied by a parent;
those returning home from an activity sponsored by a church, school
or non-profit organization; those traveling in a motor vehicle; and
those employed during curfew hours or on an emergency errand.
   Police would take violators to the nearest police station and
call their parents. There would be no fine for a first violation.
Parents would be fined $100 for the second violation and $300 for
all subsequent ones.
   If the parent didn't come for the violator, the youth would be
in the custody of the Human Services Department's child protective
services office until 6 a.m., then sent home.
   Spitzer said the curfew law discriminates against poorer
juveniles because many come from broken homes or have parents
working odd shifts and unable to accompany them.
   He said youths living in public housing could not step out the
door during the curfew while youngsters in more affluent
neighborhoods have private property surrounding their homes.
   Assistant city lawyer Victor Long said that the council had
adopted the ``least restrictive measure'' it could to deal with
juvenile crime. The law did not infringe on constitutional rights
but sought to place ``reasonable restraints'' for ``a valid
reason,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tempest Erupts Over Showing Film Narrated by Cronkite</HEAD>

   Organizers of a news conference said Monday
they had deferred to Walter Cronkite and wound not show a film he
narrated, as they had planned to do, because CBS, Cronkite's
employer for 35 years, would be attacked at the same news
conference.
   As a result of the objections by Cronkite and the film's
producer, a conservative consumer group, Consumer Alert, showed
only snippets of interviews with scientists from the 30-minute film
``Big Fears, Little Risks'' produced for the American Council on
Science and Health.
   The council is a New York-based group frequently supported by
industry. The film argues that most chemical carcinogens in food
pose small or trivial risks when compared with natural food
substances and life-style causes of cancer like smoking.
   According to the producer, Frank Powers, Consumer Alert last
week distributed a news release implying ``you're going to see a
free-for-all over Alar,'' the apple growth regulator that was the
subject of a ``60 Minutes'' segment on CBS in February, with Reed
Irvine, chairman of Accuracy in Media, using the film to attack the
television program.
   Cronkite worked for CBS for 35 years before his retirment in
1981. He is a CBS director.
   Betty Furness, an NBC reporter, sent a copy of the release by
facsimile to Cronkite traveling in Europe. According to Ms.
Furness, who attended the Consumer Alert news conference as a
reporter, ``Mr. Cronkite does not have any problem with the film.
The problem was the juxtaposition of the two events,'' the film and
a criticism of CBS' handling of the Alar story, she said.
   ``He said he was asking that the film be withdrawn'' from the
news conference, she said.
   Irvine showed the film to a reporter in his office. It does not
mention Alar, contains only a brief reference to pesticides in
apple sauce and says nothing about ``60 Minutes.''
   The press release was withdrawn after objections by Cronkite's
attorney and a version was issued that said Irvine, after the film,
``will discuss how the media, particularly `60 Minutes,'' was a
willing partner'' in transmitting erroneous information about Alar.
A copy of the original release was not available Monday.
   In New York, ``60 Minutes'' spokesman Ray Brunett said the
program was ``putting together another report which will address
questions raised since the first broadcast.''
   Irvine said Powers told him ``it was his objective to preserve
his relationship with Mr. Cronkite.'' Powers said that was true,
but not the only reason he refused to permit the film to be shown
at the news conference.
   ``The purpose of the film was not to get into this controversy
or that controversy. It would be counterproductive. We have an
important public health message here,'' he said by telephone from
New York.
   ``As the copyright holder, we were within our rights,'' he said.
   Barbara Keating-Edh, president of Consumer Alert, said ``great
pressure'' was brought on her not to show the film, and she
believed she had to defer to Elizabeth Whelan, president of the
American Council on Science and Health, not to show it.
   Irvine praised the film and the message conveyed by Cronkite,
``As surprising as it may seem, there is increasing evidence that
the presence of trace amounts of chemicals in the environment pose
no threat to human health.''
   Irvine's criticisms of the ``60 Minutes'' segment echoed those
made by the Environmental Protection Agency and others that the
program greatly overstated the risks of cancer produced by a
lifetime of exposure to apples to which it had been applied.
   ``It was wrong to frighten the public about the presence in
apple juice of traces of a chemical that pose no more danger to
human health than the traces of the carcingen chloroform that is
found in chlorinated tap water,'' he said.

   One of the jurors weighing Oliver North's fate
complained Monday of high blood pressure, and the judge said,
``there is a cold virus running through other jurors.'' But
deliberations in North's trial continued through a third day.
   In mid-afternoon, the jury sent a note to U.S. District Judge
Gerhard A. Gesell that ``people are complaining of being too close,
too tight,'' and asked ``can you help with a bigger room.''
   Gesell did. He made his courtroom available with U.S. marshals
at the front and back doors. Until then, the jury had been in an
18-by-12 room and had the use of a similar-size adjoining room as a
lounge.
   The jurors spent about six hours in their task before quitting
for the day. They have deliberated a total of 15 hours since they
began on Friday.
   In her note, jury foreman Denise M. Anderson asked for a dozen
yellow legal pads and said in a footnote that ``right now we are
reading (no talking) through documents that pertain to charges.''
   She said, too, ``we will always take lunch at 12:00 noon for one
hour,'' suggesting that the jurors were settling in for an extended
stay.
   ``None of these people are complaining they can't go forward,''
said Gesell after he received the note about the juror's blood
pressure. He summoned lawyers for both sides into the courtroom for
the first time since the jury received the case last Thursday.
   But, Gesell said, ``there is potentially a health problem with
these jurors.''
   There was no discussion in court of what course would be
followed if any of the jurors were forced to drop out. Court rules
state that if it becomes necessary to excuse a juror during
deliberations, ``in the discretion of the court a valid verdict may
be returned by the remaining 11 jurors.''
   North, the former Reagan administration aide, was not in court
Monday. He has been on trial since Jan. 31 on 12 criminal charges
that include lying to Congress, obstructing congressional and
presidential inquiries, and making personal use of funds involved
in the secret effort to help the Nicaraguan Contra rebels at a time
when official U.S. aid was banned.
   He could be sentenced to as much as 60 years in prison and fined
up to $3 million if convicted on all counts.
   Meanwhile, President Bush said he hasn't discussed with anyone a
possible pardon for North if he should be convicted.
   Bush commenting aboard Air Force One on his way to a speech in
Chicago, said speculation about what he'll do is ``stupid'' and
``idiotic'' _ and uninformed since ``I haven't discussed it nor
shared my thoughts with anybody. I don't have any thoughts until I
get the facts.''
   He was responding to a question about a report in Newsweek
magazine quoting sources close to him as predicting he would never
pardon North.
   In Washington, Gesell came into the courtroom after receiving a
note from the foreman that said: ``Could you please send for nurse
for Jean Johnson. Recheck blood pressure.''
   Mrs. Johnson, 53, registered a blood pressure of 160-over-98
when she was checked by the courthouse nurse, Gesell said. He got
the lawyers' permission to summon her own doctor and have her
examined in the presence of a U.S. marshal.
   ``Apparently the juror had a blood pressure problem and the
blood pressure elevated, perhaps in part because her diet (while
the jury is sequestered) is richer than she is accustomed to,''
Gesell said.
   Two of the other jurors reported that they were suffering from
chest colds. They were given nonprescription medications by the
nurse.
   Gesell also told the lawyers that NBC News left unsigned letters
at the homes of the North case jurors, inviting them to be
interviewed after the trial is over.
   ``I think it was most inappropriate, improper conduct, quite
disrespectful of the situation we are dealing with,'' he said. But,
he said, it was too late to do anything about it.
   The NBC letters were slipped under doors at the jurors' homes.
One was discovered by a U.S. marshal who went to one of the homes
to pick up a jury member's mail.
   ``My impression is that the juror was angry,'' the judge said.
``Other jurors showed a similar concern and said they didn't want
anything to do with it.''
   NBC News spokeswoman Peggy Hubble in New York said, ``It was
intended for them to see them when they got home after they made
their decision after the trial. ... I think once people understand
what happened, there's not much of a problem with it really.'' She
added, ``We're sorry if there was any inconvenience or
misinterpretation.''
   As for the possibility of one or more jurors being unable to
continue, Washington lawyer Richard Ben Veniste said that since
1983 the rules of criminal procedure have said that in such cases a
verdict may be returned by the remaining 11.
   Losing two members of a 12-member jury, however, would result in
a mistrial, Ben Veniste said.
   Gesell dismissed all alternate jurors when the regular jurors
began deliberation, and two of the alternates have appeared on
television commenting on the case.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Gerald L. Baliles proposed an overhaul
Monday for the state income tax, exempting all pensioners making
less than $16,000 a year but imposing taxes for the first time on
state goverment retirees making more.
   A U.S. Supreme Court decision last month in a Michigan case
barred states from treating federal pensioners differently from
retirees of state and local government agencies, prompting Baliles
to call a special legislative session to amend Virginia's laws.
   ``It is an unprecedented circumstance that has obliged me to
call you back into special session,'' the first-term Democratic
governor told the General Assembly. The legislature has until
Thursday, the end of the special session, to take action.
   Virginia is one of 24 states that is affected by the March 28
Supreme Court ruling because they impose income taxes on federal
retirement pensions while exempting pensions paid to retired state
and local public employees. With nearly 200,000 federal civilian
and military retirees, Virginia is potentially hardest hit of all
states.
   In all, Baliles' proposal would cost the state treasury about
$46 million. The governor said the loss could be covered by reserve
funds without cutting existing state programs.
   The Supreme Court didn't spell out how states much tax their
federal and state government pensioners, only that the two groups
must be treated equally.
   Baliles said he considered a number of options, but chose the
$16,000 cutoff because he believed it to be the most fair to
retirees and state taxpayers.
   He said his desire for fairness also prompted him to propose
exempting retirees of private employers from the income tax, if
they make less than $16,000. The high court decision did not cover
private pensioners.
   ``Recognize this one fact: Whatever tax relief we give to one
group of taxpayers _ in this case retirees _ will be at the expense
of other Virginia citizens,'' Baliles said. ``That is unavoidable.''
   ``The Supreme Court said treat all public retirees the same,''
he said. ``I believe this plan does that and, at the same time,
reaches out to grant private retirees identical tax relief.''
   Baliles acknowledged his plan would not be liked by government
retirees with higher incomes, such as high-ranking military
officers. But if the plan had been in effect in 1987, Baliles said,
four out of five retirees who filed a tax return would not have
paid state income taxes.
   Social Security benefits would be tax-free, the governor said.
The pension tax would apply to people age 55 and over.

   Social scientists are debating what turns English
soccer fans into tribal mobs as a shattered nation buries its dead
from the Sheffield stadium tragedy and awaits its share of the
blame for an earlier disaster.
   Researchers are trying to explain why soccer stadiums become
breeding grounds for racism and violence, and why blue-collar males
are attracted to hooliganism the way youngsters in Los Angeles are
drawn to inner-city gangs.
   They also are exploring why many young fans shun the comfort of
seated areas and choose to stand for hours on a cold, crowded
concrete terrace _ the scene of the April 15 crush that killed 95
Liverpool fans in Sheffield.
   Days after that tragedy, England is readying itself for another
reminder of the stains on its image of polished civility. A Belgian
judge will issue his verdict Friday in the case of 26 Liverpool
fans accused of causing the 1985 Heysel stadium riot in which 39
people died.
   The Sheffield disaster was caused less by outright hooliganism
than by overcrowding, but it quickened the debate on such questions
as what causes a crowd to become belligerent or to stampede;
whether the game itself is to blame, and whether outdated stadiums
turn people into animals.
   Violence by sports fans is not new. Chariot race hooligans
caused a riot in sixth century Rome that reputedly led to 30,000
deaths.
   Today, political scientists are focusing on the unequal
distribution of wealth and jobs in England, particularly in
industrial cities such as Liverpool, and the role that class
distinctions play in treatment of crowds.
   Commentators are accusing the soccer establishment of showing
contempt for fans by providing inadequate facilities and neglecting
safety.
   Social scientists are concentrating on human behavior and the
way it reacts to the environment. They point to degrading
conditions on the terraces of 19th-century stadiums, in which
comfort and sanitation are ignored.
   ``The more you treat them like animals, the more it's likely to
be a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' said criminologist Eugene
Trivizas, a specialist in hooligan behavior.
   Psychologist David Canter accuses clubs of ``almost literally
getting away with murder for the last 10 years or so'' by skimping
on stadium facilities.
   Despite the discomfort on the terraces, researchers say young
urban males prefer the ``shared ordeal'' of packing together like
sardines, because it offers them anonymity and a sense of power.
   ``Young males in urban populations lack any kind of group
identity and this is what football (soccer) gives them,'' said
Desmond Morris, author of popular anthropological studies like
``The Naked Ape.''
   ``It offers them a chance to belong to a group and express their
joys and fears through that group. Young males need to express
themselves in some way that involves risk-taking and honor,'' he
said in an interview.
   Bolstered by alcohol and machismo, they press their bodies
against one another and sway to team songs just as their fathers
and grandfathers did. They yell racial epithets at players, crude
insults at women.
   ``Working classes are less likely to express emotion in subtle
verbal forms,'' said Canter, whose book ``Football in its Place''
is to be published in May. ``It's more likely to be some sort of
physical representation, such as jumping up and down and shouting.''
   Trivizas said absorption in a crowd dismisses personal
inhibitions because fans believe ``it is difficult to be held
responsible or to be identified if they misbehave.''
   ``There is an impression of universality. If other people are
doing what you are doing, then you think what you're doing cannot
be wrong. People think they can behave with relative impunity.''
   In his 1981 book ``The Soccer Tribe,'' Morris likened soccer
fans to religious zealots and warned that the tribal element could
be eradicated by forcing fans to sit comfortably and quietly in
stadiums and ``turning this symbolic event into Disneyland fun.''
   ``Perhaps the greatest dilemma facing the Soccer Tribe today is
the question of whether its main activity is a sacred ritual or a
social entertainment,'' he wrote. ``Should the ancient traditions
of Spartan suffering give way to theater comforts and modern
razzmatazz?''

   Nearly a third of those needing heart
transplants eventually may be candidates for new surgery in which a
flap of back muscle is wrapped around the ailing heart to help it
pump, doctors said Monday.
   ``The candidates, ideally, will be people who are heading toward
a heart transplant, but still have enough reserve left,'' said Dr.
George Magovern, chairman of surgery at Allegheny General Hospital.
   The experimental procedure was performed last month using a
special pacemaker that stimulates the transplanted back muscle in
multiple bursts, unlike conventional, single-pulse pacemakers. The
muscle is thus able to contract with the heart over longer periods
of time.
   It was the first time the 3\-ounce cardiomyostimulator,
manufactured by Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis, had been implanted
into a patient in the United States, Magovern said. Allegheny
General is the only hospital with U.S. Food and Drug Administration
approval to use the device in clinical trials.
   The patient, Ralph Beilstein, 57, an interior decorator from
nearby Sewickley, said he feels ``marvelous.'' He had suffered from
chronic heart failure since 1964.
   His left latissimus dorsi muscle was partially removed March 20
and wrapped around his heart three days later. The pacemaker was
implanted during the March 23 operation below the left side of his
rib cage and turned on March 31. He was discharged Wednesday.
   ``I just generally feel better, psychologically as well as
physically,'' Beilstein said at a hospital news conference attended
by his wife, Virginia, and their four daughters and eight
grandchildren.
   He was able to avoid a heart transplant, a riskier procedure
that can involve lengthy waits because of the scarcity of donor
organs.
   The muscle-flap operation was first performed in the United
States by Magovern in 1985. The procedure had been performed only
once before, about six months earlier in Paris.
   By Jan. 1, the muscle-flap operation had been performed about 40
times around the world, six of them at Allegheny General, said Dr.
Ignacio Christlieb, who assisted in Beilstein's operation.
   The cardiomyostimulator was used in about three-quarters of the
cases, all overseas.
   In each case, doctors detach the left latissimus dorsi muscle
from the patient's back, except for a small portion remaining
attached by an artery and nerve under the arm. About 2 inches of
one rib is removed, and the muscle flap is pushed through and
wrapped around the heart.
   A 1{-foot-long wire woven through the muscle flap is attached to
the implanted pacemaker, which is run by a lithium battery.
   One system of insulated wires sends signals from the heart to
the pacemaker. Another sends signals to electrodes in the muscle
flap, enabling the muscle to beat in tandem with the heart.
   Skeletal muscle, such as the latissimus dorsi, lacks the natural
electrical conduction system of heart muscle and therefore requires
a precisely timed and controlled burst of pulses to stimulate
contraction.
   Beilstein said he is not limited physically as a result of his
removed muscle. The muscle has been removed and used in the past in
breast reconstruction and repairing leg fractures.
   ``It's a muscle the body can spare,'' Heckler said.
   Doctors say they're not sure how long the muscle will be able to
function around the heart.
   ``It's like you're training an athlete to perform a given
task,'' Christlieb said. ``If you take that training continuously,
the nutrition is good and there's no additional disease, it (back
muscle) could go on for a lifetime.
   ``What we don't know for sure is which is the ideal electric
current to do this, and that's part of our ongoing
investigations,'' he said.

   Iran on Monday urged the U.N. Security Council to
pressure Iraq for concessions in the floundering peace talks aimed
at a permanent settlement of the Persian Gulf war.
   Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran made the call after
both sides reported no progress in their fourth round of
U.N.-sponsored talks, which ended Sunday in Geneva.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said he will seek
a new meeting between Velayati and his Iraqi counterpart, Tariq
Aziz, in June.
   However, Velayati told a news conference Monday that ``it is
difficult to continue such a situation.''
   He called on the five permanent Security Council members,
including the United States and the Soviet Union, to put pressure
on Iraq.
   ``They should help the secretary-general; otherwise, I don't
know what will happen,'' he said.
   For his part, Aziz said Iran ``refrained from the correct manner
of conducting negotiations'' but did not elaborate.
   There has been little progress since the talks began last Aug.
25, five days after a U.N.-supervised truce took effect.
   At least 1 million people were killed or wounded in the war,
which began with several border skirmishes and an Iraqi invasion of
Iran in September 1980. Iran has demanded a full withdrawal of
Iraqi troops from its territory. Iraq has said the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, its only sea outlet, must first be cleared of war debris
and silt.
   Perez de Cuellar, who chaired the latest round of talks, said
both sides renewed their commitment to the cease-fire and to more
talks.

   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh denied
Monday that the city is being shortchanged on federal funds and
resources to fight violent street gangs and drug trafficking.
   ``Do you have enough? No. Will you ever have enough? Never,''
Thornburgh said.
   He was in town to be briefed on the Los Angeles Gang Drug Task
Force, a multiagency group organized six months ago to target major
drug distributors affiliated with street gangs.
   ``We have become the principal center for distribution of
cocaine in the United States,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner.
``Los Angeles right now is distributing more than half of the
nation's cocaine.''
   The gangs are responsible for distributing crack or rock cocaine
to 47 cities outside Los Angeles and are the prime suppliers to the
Washington, D.C., area, Bonner said.
   Thornburgh recently chose the nation's capital for a test
project in which federal law enforcement will focus efforts there
to curb its rampant drug problem.
   At a news conference later, Thornburgh was asked why Los Angeles
wasn't chosen for the experiment since authorities here say it's
the nation's major drug center.
   ``The problem is not confined to Los Angeles. I assure you it is
a major priority,'' he said.
   Thornburgh added that 24 prosecutors have been added to the U.S.
Attorney's Office here and the government has tripled its
allocations to local and state governments to fight the growing
national drug problem.
   ``We never have enough in terms of resources ... the notion that
we're writing off this effort is nonsense,'' he said, stressing
that the national and international drug problem is the priority of
federal law enforcement.
   John Zienter, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration office
in Los Angeles, said that within the last six months the task force
arrested more than 150 people and seized more than $5 million worth
of drugs, cash, weapons and property, including exotic cars and
expensive houses.

<HEAD>Court Hears Final Testimony In Trial Of Confessed TWA Hijacker</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Testimony in the trial of
confessed TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi drew to a close Monday,
and final arguments are to begin later this week.
   Hamadi is charged with murder and air piracy in the June 1985
hijacking of a Trans World Airlines jet in which U.S. Navy diver
Robert Stethem was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage 17
days.
   Hamadi, 23, has admitted participating in the hijacking but
denied he shot Stethem.
   Final arguments are set for Friday in the trial that began last
July.
   During a brief session Monday, British Broadcasting Corp.
reporter John Simpson told the court what he observed when TWA
Flight 847 was forced to land in Algiers, Algeria during the ordeal.
   During the hijacking of the Athens-to-Rome flight the jetliner
was forced to land in Beirut three times and twice in Algeria.
   Simpson, 44, told the court he was in Algiers with a BBC
televison crew on June 14, 1985, but police prevented them from
filming the hijacked TWA plane from the airport tarmac.
   ``We were detained for about 30 minutes. Later we were allowed
to film the plane from a waiting room'' at the airport, Simpson
said.
   He said the waiting room provided only a view of the right rear
side of the aircraft, so there was no chance to film the left side
of the plane where the Boeing 727's doors are located.
   Defense attorneys had called Simpson to testify, hoping to show
that no passengers were threatened while the plane was on the
ground in Algiers.
   A West German federal investigator said earlier that the
hijackers opened one of the plane's doors and held a gun at the
head of a passenger to force Algerian officials to provide fuel for
the jetliner.
   Hamadi denied that any passengers were threatened to obtain fuel
in Algiers.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, claims his accomplice in the
hijacking, identified in court records as Hassan Ezzeddine, killed
Stethem, 23. Ezzeddine remains a fugitive.
   After Simpson's testimony, Hamadi's defense lawyers asked the
court to view videotape they said showed military attacks carried
out by Israel in Lebanon in 1982.
   Attorney Hans-Burkhardt Steck said the video was obtained from a
group in the area and would show the conditions that motivated
Hamadi to take part in the hijacking. He did not give the name of
the group.
   The court allowed the tape to be played, and it showed scenes
from war-torn Beirut and from Palestinian refugee camps.
   Prosecutor Peter Korneck objected after the tape was shown,
calling it propaganda and saying it should not be entered into
evidence.
   ``If it is, then I would like a video of (terrorist) attacks in
Paris to be shown,'' Korneck said, referring to bombings in the
French capital, including five in September 1986, that killed eight
people.
   The court did not rule immediately on the objection.

   At least 70 students occupied a University
of Massachusetts building Monday in the second takeover in a week
to protest Defense Department-funded research.
   Campus police sealed off Memorial Hall after about 70 protesters
entered around 1 p.m., said university spokeswoman Stacey Chase.
Police allowed students out of the building, but not in.
   No attempt was made to arrest or remove the protesters from the
building, Chase said. ``Whether action comes later remains to be
seen,'' she said.
   The protesters, calling themselves People for a Socially
Responsible University, presented administrators with a list of
demands including a halt to all Defense Department research on
campus and the withdrawal of charges against seven students
arrested Wednesday in a similar occupation at another university
building.
   The seven arrested last week on trespassing and disorderly
conduct charges were among those occupying Memorial Hall on Monday,
Chase said.
   Army-funded research at the university on the disease anthrax
will be the topic of a hearing before the Amherst Board of Health
that has been scheduled for Wednesday.
   Members of the local chapter of the American Friends Service
Committee contend the research is dangerous to the town, promotes
militarism and should be banned.
   The university says the purpose of the research is peaceful and
that the strain of bacteria used is non-virulent and has been under
study at the school for 23 years without incident.

   The push to get a piece of the lottery
action has spread, sending Wednesday's jackpot soaring to $83
million, as out-of-staters grab up tickets and cajole airline
employees to make buys for them.
   The Super 7 drawing has an $83 million jackpot, a North American
record, lottery officials said Monday afternoon. They also said the
figure continues to climb.
   The jackpot kept growing after six drawings yielded no winning
ticket. It is now being boosted by sales of blocs of tickets and
sales to people living in other states. Last week's jackpot was for
$46 million. Unclaimed, it grew to $62 million Thursday. It hit $70
million by the weekend. All gains after $62 million were based on
ticket sales.
   Super 7 players pick seven numbers out of 80. The lottery bureau
will draw 11 numbers Wednesday evening, and any ticket with seven
of them qualifies for the big prize. If one person wins, the annual
payout would be nearly $3.2 million a year for 26 years.
   ``Weekends are normally slow sales days, but this past Saturday
and Sunday, we did $13.7 million in Super 7 sales alone,'' lottery
executive director Jim Scroggins said Monday.
   At Philadelphia's airport, the lottery ticket line was 30 deep
at lunchtime.
   ``People are talking about it on the planes. Some of them want
to give the flight crews money to buy tickets,'' said Susan Antoine
of Richmond, a stewardess who said she planned to buy 50 tickets
for herself.
   Fantasies abounded in line.
   ``If I win I'll buy Donald Trump's yacht and invite him to go
for a ride on it,'' said Louise Henshaw of Hammonton, N.J.
   ``I'd start with a new orange juicer,'' joked Cathy Reuben of
Boston, who got serious: ``What I'd really want is to rent Carnegie
Hall for my sister, who's a pianist.''
   ``I'd take a vacation for the rest of my life,'' said Paul
Kreczko of Chicago, an American Airlines employee who made a
special trip to buy 777 tickets.
   ``Let's see, there's the pool at work, there's tickets for my
family, there's the pool for the people at the bar where I throw
darts, there's the pool for the people we throw darts against _ it
comes to 77 people.''
   Kreczko missed one plane back to Illinois while waiting for his
tickets. He didn't mind.
   ``I think we're going to be lucky,'' he said. ``With 777 tickets
and 77 people, how can we miss?''
   Residents of other states don't have to travel to Pennsylvania
or know somebody in the state to buy a ticket. Tickets Plus, which
mostly sells concert tickets, is selling lottery chances to
out-of-staters willing to pay double the $1 ticket price.
   The outlet has shipped 50-ticket Super 7 packets to California,
Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota and Washington, company officials said.
   ``It's hard to keep up with it. In fact, it's tremendous,'' said
Gary Zurenda, owner of the company in Exeter.
   Zurenda placed ads in newspapers around the country offering to
act as a ticket broker. Customers must buy a minimum of 50 tickets
at $2 apiece, and they also have to pay $10 for overnight mail
delivery.

   Guerrilla rocket and artillery attacks
on Jalalabad took the lives of four people, and return fire by
government soldiers killed 54 insurgents, the government said
Monday.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani also reported
fighting in three other provinces during the previous 24 hours. He
gave the casualties as 32 dead and six wounded.
   At the United Nations in New York, Afghan Foreign Minister Abdul
Wakil on Monday said his government will retaliate against Pakistan
if it does not stop supporting Afghan rebels.
   He told the Security Council in a 90-minute speech, ``If the
Security Council fails to adopt necessary measures for defusing the
present tense situation, and if Pakistani aggression and
intervention against our contry is continued, we will have no
choice but the firm and patriotic defense of our country.''
   Wakil said the Pakistani side must understand that its territory
was as vulnerable to rocket attacks as Afghanistan, bombarded by
rockets transported across the Afghan-Pakistan border.
   None of the casualty figures reported Monday could be verified.
Both the Marxist government and Moslem guerrillas generally
exaggerate the other side's losses.
   Amani said guerrillas fired from two directions on Jalalabad,
which they have besieged for seven weeks. He said four civilians
were killed and 12 wounded.
   Soldiers returned the fire, the spokesman said, and he gave
enemy casualties as 54 killed and 35 wounded. Amani claimed
Pakistani and Saudi advisers were among the dead.
   Two soldiers were wounded and three houses and a marrket
destroyed by the guerrilla shelling, he said.
   Jalalabad is a provincial capital 75 miles east of Kabul and
once had a population of 64,000. It has been under heavy rocket and
artillery attack since the siege began March 6.
   Capturing it would give the insurgents a base for the exile
government they formed in Pakistan two months ago and help them
gain momentum to for an attack on the capital. Jalalabad is near
the Afghanistan end of the Khyber Pass, about 45 miles from the
Pakistan frontier.
   When the offensive began, guerrilla leaders predicted Jalalabad
would fall within days, but the Afghan army is equipped with
sophisticated Soviet weapons and has repulsed the attacks.
Diplomats in Kabul say both sides have suffered heavy casualties.
   The Soviet Union completed withdrawal of its military forces
from Afghanistan, under a U.N.-mediated agreement, on Feb. 15 but
continues supplying Afghanistan's army.
   Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia and China are among
major supporters and suppliers of the insurgents, who began
fighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers
entered the war in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were in
Afghanistan when the withdrawal began.
   In reports Monday on the other fighting, Amani said guerrillas
shelled Kandahar in the south, wounding two civilians. He said
soldiers killed at least 27 insurgents and captured 10.
   Amani said three civilians were killed in Paktia province in the
south, and two insurgents were killed and four wounded in Herat, a
wetern province.
   In a dispatch from Kabul on the fighting, the Soviet news agency
Tass said the Afghan Foreign Ministry sent three new notes to U.N.
representatives complaining of Pakistani violations of the Geneva
accords.
   Tass also reported that the new Indian ambassador to
Afghanistan, Muhammed Hamid Ansari, on Monday presented his
credentials to President Najib, stressing friendly ties between the
Indian and Afghan nations.

<HEAD>Czech Rock Band Emerges From Underground With U.S. Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NORTHAMPTOM, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Czechoslovakian rock band whose
leaders were jailed in the 1970s is touring the United States in
what its guitarist calls ``a sign of better times'' for Eastern
Europe.
   Initially denounced as ``moral filth'' by the government-run
Czech press, the band endured two decades of legal trouble before
obtaining official status last May and changing its name from
Plastic People of the Universe to Pulnoc, the Czech word for
midnight.
   The three-week American tour, which began Saturday in Chicago,
is the group's first opportunity to perform abroad and ``an
incredible turn of events that no one could have dreamed of even a
few years ago,'' said Timothy W. Ryback, a Harvard University
lecturer and expert on Eastern European rock.
   Although little known in the West, the group has attracted an
enormous following in Czechoslovakia through underground recordings
and small concerts under its original name, Ryback said.
   ``For 20 years, the Plastic People have been unquestionably the
premiere underground rock band in Czechoslovakia and probably all
of Eastern Europe,'' he said.
   At a nightclub here Sunday night, the band's lead singer and
only female member, Michaela Nemcova, traced haunting melodies over
a background of guitars, keyboards, drums and cello.
   The crowd, mainly students from nearby Mount Holyoke and Smith
Colleges, responded with three encores even though the Czech lyrics
were incomprehensible to most.
   ``We're not touring just for ourselves, but for everyone back
home,'' guitarist Milan Hlavsa, 39, said after the show. ``It's a
sign of better times, of hope, for our country.''
   Hlavsa, one of the band's original members, dedicated Sunday's
show to dissident playwright Vaclav Havel and the band's former
manager, Ivan Jirous, who are both in Czech prisons for political
crimes.
   But Hlavsa, who also spent six months in jail during a
government crackdown on rock bands in 1976, insisted the group's
message was not political.
   ``To us, rock 'n' roll means life, joy and creativity, and to
our fans, it means they can unwind, they can feel some sort of
freedom,'' he said through an interpreter. ``But I know it can be
dangerous, even if it's not political.''
   Hlavsa and guitarist Jiri Kabes formed Plastic People in 1968,
shortly after Soviet tanks rolled into the Czech capital to crush
the democratic social and political movement known as Prague Spring.
   At first, they were tolerated by the authorities. But in 1970,
their official status was revoked and they emerged as leaders in
what Jirous termed Czechoslovakia's ``second,'' or unofficial,
culture.
   Despite their popularity, all of the band members must work at
other jobs to support themselves. Keyboardist Josef Janicek is a
school janitor; drummer Petr Kumamdzas, a hospital orderly; cellist
Tomas Schilla, an X-ray technician.
   Ryback, the Harvard expert, said the band's recent acceptance of
official status has eased their circumstances, allowing them to
obtain top-quality equipment, to perform openly and, perhaps in the
future, to issue albums through the state record company.
   But, he said, the move was controversial.
   ``I think they have alienated some of their fans, because it
looks like they cut a deal with the state,'' he said. ``But that's
probably unfair, because they have gone through a hell of a lot.''
   The band also planned to go to New York, Knoxville, Tenn.,
Washington, San Francisco, Seattle and Boston, performing mainly in
nightclubs with a capacity of 100 to 400.

<HEAD>Relief Convoy Safely Retraces Route Taken By Ambushed Trucks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.N. relief convoy safely reached
rebel-held Torit on Monday, six days after a deadly ambush halted
the United Nation's first overland effort to deliver food to the
southern Sudanese town.
   The 31-one truck convoy carried nearly 440 tons of corn on its
14-hour trip from the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army base of
Kapoeta, 100 miles to the west, said spokesman Paul Mitchell of the
U.N. World Food Program.
   Attackers ambushed the first U.N. convoy from Kapoeta to Torit
last Tuesday, killing eight rebel escorts and destroying the lead
vehicle. Mitchell said organizers of the U.N. Operation Lifeline
Sudan hoped the overland route now would be used regularly.
   The $132 million U.N. operation is trying to to prevent 100,000
famine deaths in southern Sudan by stocking food and supplies in
the war-torn region before heavy annual rains begin in mid-May.
   U.N. officials say they probably will fail to meet their goal of
moving 115,500 tons _ the amount needed to stave off widespread
starvation. Last year, as many as 500,000 southern Sudanese died
because of flood- and war-induced famine.
   The United Nations on Friday began airlifting relief supplies to
Torit, which it says has a swelling population now numbering 25,000
people. A recent visitor, however, estimated only about 3,000
people were taking refuge in the town, with many others farming
normally on its outskirts.
   Mitchell said a French-financed Transall C-160 cargo plane on
Monday joined the C-130 already delivering food and that a second
Transall funded by the West Germans was expected to join the
airlift this week.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan began April 1 after the rebel army and
Sudan's government agreed to allow the relief supplies move
unhampered to both rebel-held and government-controlled towns.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms against Sudan's
Moslem-dominated government in 1983, demanding greater autonomy and
economic development for the predominantly Christian and animist
south.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Sensationalism Can Hurt Consumers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Monday that sensationalism and misleading news stories about food
safety can hurt consumers when accurate information is needed most.
   Yeutter, speaking to a meeting of the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists, cited recent cases involving chemicals in
the food supply. One of those was about chemicals such as Alar used
in apple production.
   A recent study by a private environmental group, the Natural
Resources Defense Council, suggested that children may be exposed
to dangerous levels of carcinogenic chemicals in fruits and
vegetables because they eat large amounts in proportion to their
weight.
   The council's study singled out Alar, and alarms were raised
throughout the country about the possible hazards of eating apples.
   Government regulatory agencies, including the Environmental
Protection Agency, Food and Drug Administration and the Agriculture
Department, said there was no need to panic and that there was no
reason for parents to keep apples from children.
   ``We need to make sure that these volatile issues are handled as
well as possible from a communications standpoint,'' he said.
``Obviously, we have freedom of the press in this country, and the
media can do what it wishes in this area _ just as it does in other
areas.''
   Yeutter added: ``And if folks choose to provide coverage for
misleading research studies or choose to distort or sensationalize,
they're privileged to do so, that's the price we pay for a
democratic society.''
   In the meantime, Yeutter said he hoped ``we can do an effective
job of keeping these issues in proper balance.''
   One reporter asked what Yeutter meant by ``proper balance'' in
news reports.
   ``That means making sure that the facts are out, and not simply
someone's distorted interpretation of what they read, see or
hear,'' he said.
   The Agriculture Department, which sometimes in the past has been
accused of sticking up for farm interests at the expense of
consumers and environmentalists, needs to have a spotless
reputation on such sensitive issues, Yeutter said.
   ``We're going to play it straight in the department in these
areas, and I hope we can establish a reputation for credibility on
all fronts,'' he said. ``If we say something about an Alar
situation, or we say something about any other food safety
question, my intent is that we do it in such a way that it will
command the respect of everyone who views that issue or evaluates
it in any way.''
   Yeutter said he wants USDA ``to have the respect'' of both sides
of an issue.

   Advocates for the homeless have accused the
Bush administration of violating a federal court order to make
surplus government property available for the homeless.
   The National Coalition for the Homeless filed a motion late
Friday with U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch in Washington charging
that the Department of Health and Human Services is refusing to
accept or process applications for properties the coalition
contends are suitable for the homeless. HHS was designated as the
agency to process the applications, the coalition said.
   Gasch ruled in a suit by the group last December that the
federal government must review hundreds of surplus federal
properties across the country for possible use by the homeless.
   The coalition contends that under the 1987 McKinney Homeless
Assistance Act passed by Congress, properties determined suitable
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development must be made
available to states, local governments and non-profit groups to use
as facilities to shelter or assist the homeless.
   The motion charges that HHS has limited its review to properties
designated ``excess'' by the agency holding the property,
regardless of HUD's determination. That excludes 87 percent of the
1,415 properties HUD has determined suitable, it contends.
   Amy Brown, spokeswoman for the Justice Department, said the
government will file a response next week. ``The government
believes that it has been in compliance with the December 1988
court order and the McKinney Act,'' she said.
   Maria Foscarinis, counsel for the homeless coalition, said it
asks the judge to order HHS to immediately accept and process
applications and to freeze any sales or transfers while the
applications are being reviewed.
   The coalition said local groups have unsuccessfully sought to
use buildings and land in Los Angeles; Huntsville, Ala.; St. Paul,
Minn.; and Seattle.

   Three months ago The Who's Pete Townshend,
inducting the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,
took a swipe at the mercenary side of the Stones' upcoming reunion
tour.
   ``It won't be easy for the Stones the next time around, and if
it wasn't for the vast sums of money they can make, they might not
bother at all,'' Townshend jibed. ``... At least, Mick probably
wouldn't. It's lucky for us fans that he has such expensive
tastes.''
   Now it's Mick Jagger's turn.
   Two generations after ``My Generation,'' Townshend, Roger
Daltrey and John Entwistle announced Monday they were reuniting for
a 25th anniversary tour _ their first since 1982-83's ``Farewell
Tour.'' The band also appeared in a one-shot reunion at Live Aid.
   Daltrey said they had decided against making an album to be
released while they're touring.
   ``We felt like we weren't trying to resurrect the band. This is
a celebration of the music we created, after all these years,'' he
said. ``One of the reasons we stopped is we were on that
album-tour-album-tour rat race of the rock 'n' roll industry. To
come back and do all that again we thought was a mistake.''
   The tour will include two full-length performances of the rock
opera ``Tommy,'' with guest stars, in New York City and Los
Angeles. The latter concert will be videotaped. Those concerts and
the video will be benefits for the Nordoff-Robbins Music Therapy
Foundation for autistic children.
   The British band last performed ``Tommy,'' by Townshend, in its
entirety 17 years ago in Chicago.
   Townshend acknowledged he has suffered a hearing loss, saying he
has a ``ringing in the ears at the kind of frequencies at which I
play guitar. If I expopse myself to loud electric guitar,
particularly my own, my hearing suffers.''
   ``I'm still very nervous about how I can work on stage without
further damage to my hearing,'' he said, but then drew a laugh by
adding: ``We're going to play very, very quietly.''
   The return of the Stones and The Who to the stage highlights
what seems to be a trend in rock 'n' roll today. Jefferson Airplane
and The Stray Cats are reuniting. In recent months David Crosby has
taken part in a pair of reunions, with ex-bandmates the Byrds and
with Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young.
   As Townshend indicated, such get-togethers are lucrative:
Rolling Stone magazine reported the Stones are guaranteed more than
$65 million for a 50-date North American tour. Ticket sales for
their 1981 tour hit $54 million.
   Or maybe the reasons are more friendship than financial: Stray
Cats leader Brian Setzer says he just missed bandmates Lee Rocker
and Slim Jim Phantom.
   There's another motivation: In most cases, the sum of the bands
has proved greater than its parts.
   Lead singers Jagger and Daltrey have both released poorly
received solo albums; the most recent, Jagger's ``Primitive Cool,''
peaked at No. 41 on the album charts, while Daltrey's voice missed
Townshend's songs.
   Guitarists Keith Richards and Townshend have both released
critically praised albums, although the latter has put most of his
effort into working part-time as an editor for the London
publishing firm Faber &amp; Faber.
   The reunions also demonstrate that you can't believe everything
you hear from rock stars. Richards, who threatened Jagger with
bodily harm if he toured minus the Stones, repeatedly bad-mouthed
his bandmate before the Stones reunited.
   As for The Who, consider this from Townshend in 1985 _ two years
after the band's decision to go its different ways: ``I think I've
had it with rock. ... It wasn't growing old that was the problem
with me in The Who. It was growing up.''

<HEAD>Government Vows Crackdown on Embattled Black Faction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government pledged Monday
to crack down with an ``iron fist'' on a banned anti-apartheid
group involved in black factional fighting that killed 13 people
over three days.
   The battles have been fought mainly between the banned United
Democratic Front and members of Inkatha, which backs KwaZulu black
homeland leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi. The front is the country's
largest anti-apartheid coalition and a political ally of the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Residents around KwaZulu, near Durban and Pietermaritzburg in
Natal Province, have accused both black groups of firebomb attacks
on homes, mob beatings and killings.
   But Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said in a speech to
Parliament Monday that security forces would concentrate on the
United Democratic Front.
   ``We know that alternative structures such as `street
committees,' `people's courts,' `civic associations,' are chiefly
responsible for the unrest and violence .... We are going to root
them out.''
   All those groups are associated with the United Democratic Front.
   ``In the process, we will be acting against people, against
activists and radicals .... We will grab them and they are going to
kick up a big fuss again. We will not be deterred. I want to warn,
we are going to use the iron fist, regardless,'' Vlok said.
   His only reference to Inkatha was his report that he had spoken
to Buthelezi. He said the homeland's leader was just as concerned
about the violence as he is.
   Factional fighting has killed 1,000 Zulu tribesmen in that
homeland over the past year. The white-led government set up the
network of black homelands to relieve pressure from domestic and
international critics.
   The front and Inkatha both oppose the apartheid policies that
enable South Africa's 5 million whites to dominate 28 million
blacks. However, the front views Buthelezi as a conservative who
weakens the struggle for black rights.
   One opposition leader accused the government of taking sides in
its reaction Monday.
   ``By heaping blame on one side only, the minister places in
doubt the neutral role of the police,'' said Peter Gastrow, the
Democratic Party's member from central Durban. ``Mr. Vlok presents
a one-sided and oversimplified version of what is happening on the
ground in Natal.''
   He blamed the violence on a complex mixture of factors involving
the two groups, gangs, vigilantes, warlords, poverty, and a loss of
confidence in authorities.
   Vlok said a police general and teams of senior detectives were
being sent to the area. He said security would be stepped up with
more vehicles and semi-permanent police stations spread over a
wider area. He said the army would be called in to assist if
necessary.
   In reporting on the fighting from Friday through Sunday, police
said Monday three people were injured in addition to the 13 men who
were killed in black townships near KwaZulu.
   Monitoring groups say more than 4,000 blacks have been killed in
clashes with police and between rival black groups since 1984.
   Violence has subsided under emergency regulations imposed by the
government nearly three years ago, but fighting has persisted
between Inkatha and the United Democratic Front.

<HEAD>Injured Georgians Ask for Antidote to Chemical Used on Them</HEAD>

   Georgians hospitalized with damage to
their central nervous systems asked the government Monday for an
antidote to whatever chemical soldiers used when dispersing a
pro-independence demonstration.
   Foreign Ministry spokesmen in Moscow have denied accusations by
Georgian activists that troopers used chemical weapons in the
confrontation April 9, but the Georgian Communist Party chief
confirmed Monday some of the 20 deaths were caused by gas.
   The leader, Givi Gumbaridze, spoke to some of the the first
foreign correspondents allowed into Georgia since the demonstration
in Tbilisi, capital of the southern republic.
   Several dozen of the approximately 120 people still hospitalized
signed a letter containing the appeal to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev for an antidote.
   Nodar Notadze, a literary scholar and one of 40 members of a
commission investigating the attack on the protesters, said
Georgian representatives would take the plea to a meeting of the
Communist Party Central Committee that begins Tuesday in Moscow.
   Nino Djavakhishvili, also on the commission, said at least 700
people were injured. Iza Ordzhonikidze, a third commission member,
said 600 of them were poisoned.
   Ms. Ordzhonikidze, a poet and museum director, said half of
those still hospitalized were children from a contaminated school
next to the demonstration site who became ill days after the clash.
   Dr. Vakhtang Bochurishvili, who teaches at Tbilisi Medical
School, said Monday, ``It is a crime that the military still will
not tell us what substances were used.''
   He was interviewed at Hospital No. 2 of Health Ministry
Department No. 4, where most victims are being treated. The
hospital usually is reserved for the Georgian elite.
   Bochurishvili said the army and Interior Ministry soldiers who
broke up the protest ``were like Nazi troops, the SS.''
   On Saturday, the Defense Ministry newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda
identified one chemical used on the protesters as an incapacitating
agent called ``cheremukha'' whose main ingredient is
chloroacetophenone. A Western military attache in Moscow said the
substance was similar to tear gas, but stronger.
   Malkahz Zaalishvili, a molecular biologist on the commission,
said the gas becomes poisonous in high concentrations.
   He and several other doctors said another gas used causes
irregular paralysis of the central nervous system, memory loss,
blackouts, headaches and nausea.
   Djavakhishvili, a morphologist, said military officials refuse
to acknowledge nerve gas was used. Ms. Ordzhonikidze said 14 of the
20 people who died did not appear to have been seriously beaten and
were believed killed by the gas, but a decision would await
autopsies.
   Shota Gamkrelidze, a pharmacologist, said he wants to help but
his ``hands are tied.''
   ``I cannot prescribe any psychotropic drugs because I don't know
what the chemical was and what will happen with these drugs,'' he
said.
   Discharged patients return with the same problems because proper
treatment cannot be administered, commission member Notadze said,
and ``the consensus is that there is no effective treatment of the
gases.''
   No soldiers were hurt by the gas, and doctors believe they had
taken an antidote they now refuse to give to the injured, said
Gamkrelidze, the pharmacologist.
   Gilo Oniani, a 34-year-old factory worker and mother, said
soldiers clubbed and kicked her even though she was weak from four
days of a hunger strike to demand that Georgia secede from the
Soviet Union.
   She said she remembered something being sprayed into her mouth
and nose, then she blacked out and awoke in the hospital with lungs
that felt scorched and could not eat because of pain in her abdomen.
   Mrs. Oniani said she cannot sleep because, like other victims,
she becomes extremely agitated for hours on end.
   Her hospital roommate, 14-year-old Tamriko Chekradze, said a
battery-sized canister of gas hit her on the head and burned her
hair, then she blacked out from pain.
   Gumbaridze, appointed chief of the Georgian party 10 days ago,
said the decision for troops to break up the demonstration was a
``serious mistake'' and several members of the republic's ruling
Politburo ``were not informed about this operation, about the
methods to be used.''
   ``I learned about the decision only a few minutes before the
clash,'' the 44-year-old former Georgian KGB chief told reporters.
He replaced Dzhumber Patiashvili, who resigned as party leader
after accepting responsibility for the violence.
   An investigation will determine who ordered the gas used,
Gumbaridze said.
   ``The fact that gases were used is the truth,'' he declared.
``Yes, some people died from poisoning.''
   Asked how authorities would respond to future protests,
Gumbaridze said: ``What happened on the ninth of April cannot
happen again.''

   A coalition of black health care
professionals, educators and community leaders Monday recommended a
series of steps to improve the health of blacks and other
minorities, including a uniform and expanded Medicaid program and a
reallocation of health-care dollars.
   Dr. David Satcher, president of Meharry Medical College in
Nashville, Tenn., said members of the coalition were concerned
about the gap in the health status of minorities compared with
white Americans.
   The infant mortality rate for blacks is twice the rate for
whites and the life expectancy of blacks is declining while it is
increasing for whites, Satcher said, citing recent studies.
   ``We feel it's a crisis we face in this nation,'' Satcher said
at a news conference, where he was joined by Rep. Louis Stokes,
D-Ohio.
   Satcher said about 40 members of the coalition presented their
recommendations to Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan. Satcher described the secretary as ``very receptive, very
concerned.''
   The recommendations included:
   _Making the Medicaid program uniform throughout the states and
expanding it so that anyone within 200 percent of the federal
poverty level is eligible.
   _Reallocating health care dollars by shifting funds from some
procedures and organ transplants that are not proven effective into
disease prevention and primary care. They did not recommend a
specific amount of money.
   _Making sure that blacks and other minorities are
``appropriately'' represented at HHS agencies whose dealings affect
minorities disproportionately, such as agencies that deal with AIDS
and substance abuse.
   _Allocating more aid for black and other minority students in
the health care fields because they are more likely than white
Americans to work in low-income areas.
   In comments before his meeting with the coalition members,
Sullivan reiterated his intention to give special emphasis to
``closing the gap in health status'' between white Americans and
black and minority Americans.

   In a chilly airplane hangar, President Bush
choked back tears Monday as he comforted grief-stricken relatives
of the 47 sailors killed on the battleship Iowa and offered ``the
sympathy and appreciation of all the American people.''
   Greeting relatives one by one, the president wore a nervous
smile as he shook hands, moving briskly from person to person
waiting along rows of folding-back chairs.
   Some of the relatives showed him a picture of their lost ones.
``This was our only son, this was our only boy,'' Bush recalled one
couple as saying. Several women stopped him for a comforting hug.
   It was an emotional beginning to the president's four-day swing
across the country as he nears the 100-day milestone of his
administration.
   Later, addressing the annual luncheon of The Associated Press,
Bush spoke of the loneliness of the office when it comes to dealing
with situations like the deaths of U.S. military personnel or the
holding of Americans hostage abroad.
   ``I vowed, when I came into the presidency, not to talk about
the burden of the presidency, the loneliness of the job or the
great toughness that nobody understands,'' Bush said. ``I learned
that from my immediate predecessor.''
   But, said Bush, ``when you do take that oath of office, you do
feel perhaps a disproportionate concern for a fallen sailor or an
individual held hostage against his or her will anywhere in the
world.''
   On Air Force One, en route to Chicago, Bush told reporters that
the Norfolk ceremony had been one of those difficult moments.
   ``Tough day down there, it was so moving,'' Bush said,
explaining that his smile had belied the emotions he felt.
   ``The Bush family is not very good at that kind of thing,
anyway. This was tough,'' he said.``But you've got to deal with it,
you've got to show them concern.''
   Bush said, ``You know how you get through it? You pray for
strength.
   ``Although I did choke up at the end there, I did feel kind of
an inner peace about the thing. I had to represent our country.''
   Accompanied by his wife, Barbara, the president flew to Norfolk
at the start of a long travel day, with stops later in Chicago for
a speech before the Associated Press annual luncheon, a
tree-planting ceremony during a centennial celebration in Bismarck,
N.D. and an overnight in San Jose, Calif.
   The 100-day mark of his administration falls on Saturday and
Bush was expected to beat the drum for his presidency in a
succession of out-of-Washington engagements. Before returning to
Washington on Thursday, Bush will make appearances in California,
Texas and Florida.
   In Chicago, Bush defended the progress of his administration and
took time to telephone newly installed Chicago Mayor Richard Daley
to wish him well and congratulate him on his April 4 victory.
   During a question-and-answer session aboard Air Force One en
route to Chicago, Bush addressed a number of issues, including
speculation about whether he would pardon fired White House aide
Oliver North, now awaiting a jury verdict in the Iran-Contra
affair. In the past, Bush has called North a hero and said he hoped
North would be acquitted.
   A Newsweek magazine report quoting sources close to him as
predicting he would never pardon North shows ``how idiotic
speculation is,'' Bush said. ``If it was given any credence as
having come from me or as if somebody had discussed it with me,
they simply haven't.''
   Bush also refused to discuss a published report that he had
authorized spending $10 million for the Panamanian opposition in
the May 7 elections. The United States has been frustrated in its
efforts to oust strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``I don't discuss intelligence matters,'' Bush said. ``We're
involved in encouraging the elections to be free and fair and
open.''
   On another matter, Bush said he had expressed concern to West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has been reluctant to modernize
short-range missiles in Europe.
   ``My appeal to the Germans has been that we keep NATO together,
stay together.'' Bush said Kohl ``knows my view. There must not be
any unilateral fait accompli.''
   On a personal note, Bush complained that he was two or three
pounds overweight and was going to do something about it. He said
his wife, Barbara, who is suffering from an overactive thyroid, was
doing well. He said there was ``nothing out there any different
than what you've been told.''
   But the emotional peak of the day clearly was Norfolk, where
Bush, a former Navy pilot, said the sailors had ``served the Navy
as shipmates and friends and left the Navy as brothers in eternity.'
   Cameramen with telescopic lenses said Bush had tears on his
cheek as he returned to his aircraft.
   Bush told the gathering at the Norfolk Naval Air Station, ``I
hope that the sympathy and appreciation of all the American people
provide some comfort. But true comfort comes from prayer and
faith.''
   In delivering his remarks, Bush omitted a line of his speech
that said as a Navy veteran, he had ``stared at the empty bunks of
lost shipmates and asked, `Why?''' He explained later that ``I
thought it was a little too subjective.''
   The Norfolk ceremony was marred by a foulup about the relatives
that Bush was supposed to personally greet. After consoling people
in the first four rows of the audience, Bush turned and left,
ignoring three rows of family members.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater explained later
that a military escort had turned Bush aside after four rows,
saying he had greeted all members of the immediate family.
   Fitzwater said Bush was distressed by the episode. ``He said,
`That's really a tragedy,''' Fitzwater said. ``He could see they
were distressed.''
   In Bismarck, Bush planted a 12-foot Elm tree during a ceremony
to mark the state's centennial.
   ``Around the world there is a growing recognition that
environmental problems respect no borders,'' Bush said.
   He said, ``We do not have to accept as inevitable the spoiling
of our air, our rivers our wetlands and our forests.''

<HEAD>Opposition Unveils Platform for June Elections</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity-led national opposition
announced an election platform on Monday urging Poles to vote in
June and ``change this system'' toward democracy.
   But the Citizens Committee also stressed it has no illusions
that democracy has already been achieved, and it does not recognize
the elections as being fully free.
   The platform was adopted Sunday at a Citizens Committee meeting
and was released Monday.
   An agreement reached April 5 between communist authorities and
the opposition, led by Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, established
the framework for elections for the national parliament, including
a new 100-member Senate.
   The opposition is allowed to run candidates for all of the
Senate seats and for 161 seats in the 460-member Sejm, the existing
parliament.
   On Sunday the committee approved 252 candidates and announced
plans to name the nine other candidates Wednesday for the 261 total.
   Walesa, who presided at Sunday's meeting, said again he would
not be a candidate and wanted to remain above the political fray to
lead Solidarity.
   Voting is set for June 4 with a runoff election on June 18.
   Solidarity activists and advisers including Bogdan Lis,
Bronislaw Geremek, Adam Michnik and Jacek Kuron are among those in
the race.
   The opening section of the platform notes that the opposition
supported boycotts of previous elections and calls for all eligible
citizens to vote this time.
   The legislative elections will be the first to be open to
opposition candidates since balloting in 1947 that critics said was
fraudulent.
   ``We appeal to everyone to take part in the elections because we
can see the advantage that Poland can achieve by the participation
of independent forces in the Sejm and the Senate,'' the platform
states.
   ``By running in the election we are not closing our eyes to the
undemocratic character of the system of ruling the country and we
are not going to make it credible.
   ``We want to change this system, achieving this on the road on
evolutionary transformations.''
   Among the platform's 26 points:
   _Changing the constitution to remove the ``leading role'' of the
Communist Party and to allow fully democratic elections in four
years.
   _Expanding the right to form associations.
   _Ending censorship and the party's control of television and
radio.
   _Reducing military and police expenditures and using the savings
to increase old-age pensions.
   _Raising pay levels so that a 42-hour work week would be
sufficient to maintain a family.
   _Making housing loans more widely available to individuals and
trimming back the monopolistic state housing enterprises.
   _Academic freedoms: No propagation of atheism or ideological
pressure in schools, freedom of association for young people and
the right to form private or parochial schools.

   The Army said Monday it had grounded its
entire fleet of Vietnam era UH-1 Huey transport helicopters for a
safety inspection of main rotor bolts.
   The service, in a statement, said the grounding order was issued
late Friday and was keeping about 3,100 choppers on the ground.
   Lt. Col. John Reitz, an Army spokesman, said the grounding order
was prompted by an incident last week in which a Huey was being
moved manually across a tarmac and two of the bolts in the ``main
rotor pillow block'' suddenly snapped.
   He said that further inspection showed cracks and stress
corrosion in the bolts.
   ``In this case, there was no accident and no loss of life,''
Reitz said. ``But you would have a big problem if this happened in
flight. So a grounding order was issued immediately to ensure
safety.''
   The bolts at issue sit atop the main rotor hub and help hold the
main rotor blades to the shaft.
   According to Reitz, Army aviation units are being advised the
Hueys can return to operation as soon as the one-time safety check
of the bolts is conducted.
   ``In all likelihood, most of the fleet will be back up in the
air very quickly,'' he added.
   The 3,100 Huey helicopters assigned to active-duty units include
three variants of the chopper _ the basic UH-1H transport; a UH-1V
Medevac variant, and an EH-1H electronic warfare variant. The Hueys
are deployed with Army units around the world.
   The grounding order did not affect another variant of the
chopper used exclusively by National Guard units.

<TEXT>
   Mobs angered at a land dispute
with Senegal sacked homes and market stalls belonging to Senegalese
on Monday, and similar attacks on Mauritanians broke out in
neighboring Senegal, officials reported.
   The attacks took place the same day officials from both
countries reportedly began investigating the April 9 shooting death
of two Senegalese, which prompted the violence. Two others have
died in violence since then.
   Bands of roving vandals roamed the streets of Nouakchott and the
Senegalese capital of Dakar on Monday, smashing cars and destroying
market stalls.
   There was no confirmation from either capital of injuries or
deaths.
   In the southern outskirts of Nouakchott, angry mobs of up to
several hundred people smashed windows, overturned cars and sacked
Senegalese homes. Senegalese were pulled from cars and beaten.
   In the border village of Rosso, Mauritania, mobs carrying
homemade weapons rampaged through the market searching for
Senegalese vendors and beating them. At least one of the small
market stands burned, and police said it belonged to a Senegalese.
   In Dakar, police said bands of vandals sacked Mauritanian
businesses and broke into homes. About a dozen Mauritanians took
refuge in a Dakar police station, the French news agency Agence
France-Presse reported.
   During the weekend, cars in Dakar bearing Mauritanian diplomatic
plates were hit by rocks and one diplomat was injured, AFP reported.
   The two African countries have been disputing a band of fertile
land near the Senegal River, which forms their border. Mauritania
has complained that Senagalese are farming the Mauritanian side of
the border.
   Mauritanian authorities killed the two Senegalese peasants April
9 in the border village of Diawara, Senegal. The same day, Senegal
captured 13 Mauritanians, who were later released.
   Dakar police said two people _ a Mauritanian and a Senegalese _
have been killed in violence since then.
   A Mauritanian government source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a joint committee investigating the Diawara
shootings began work Monday to determine exactly who fired the
shots.

   Two senior West German officials urged the
United States on Monday to negotiate reductions in battlefield
nuclear weapons with the Soviet Union, but the Bush administration
said such talks would be ``a mistake'' and instead stressed the
need for NATO unity.
   The quickly arranged meeting was held at the State Department at
the behest of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose political
future could hinge on the outcome of the dispute. It also is
causing strains in the Western alliance.
   For nearly four hours, West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg
debated the merits of keeping and improving U.S.-built Lance
missiles in their country with Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Brent Scowcroft, the
national security assistant to President Bush.
   The issue could disrupt the summit meeting Bush will attend with
the leaders of the 15 other North Atlantic Treaty Organization
countries in Brussels at the end of May unless it is resolved
before then.
   Kohl is concerned that his political career could be imperiled
unless he deters the strong drive by the United States, Britain and
France to maintain the Lances on West German soil. The West German
electorate is turning more toward disarmament, and the left-leaning
Social Democrats and Greens are gaining ground.
   Kohl is closely watching local elections to be held in June.
   As they left the State Department, Genscher and Stoltenberg gave
no indication if they made any headway. ``Good afternoon,''
Stoltenberg said to waiting reporters, declining to stop. He and
Genscher then climbed into their black limousine. They were
scheduled to return quickly to Bonn.
   Baker, meanwhile, issued a brief statement that described the
meeting as ``useful and friendly.'' He said the two sides explained
their positions.
   ``As a result,'' Baker said, ``we understand their position
better and they understand ours better.''
   He did not suggest the gulf between the two had narrowed. ``We
will continue our discussions in an effort to reach an agreement
within the alliance,'' Baker said.
   Earlier, as West Germans met with the senior U.S. officials,
Margaret Tutwiler, the State Department spokesman, said,
``Secretary Baker has said many times that it would be preferable
if we could move to modernize our short-range nuclear weapons,
although we understand the Federal Republic's problem regarding the
timing of any such decision.
   ``And he has said that we think it would be a mistake to engage
in arms control negotiations on SNF (Short-range Nuclear Forces).''
   Ms. Tutwiler said Baker`s message to the West German visitors
was that ``we should make an effort to work this out through
negotiations with the Federal Republic and our allies before the
summit.''
   Bush said he had appealed to Kohl ``that we keep NATO together,
that we stay together.''
   He said the West German leader, who arranged the trip by
Genscher and Stoltenberg in a telephone call to Bush last Friday,
``knows my view that there must not be any unilateral fait accompli
here.''
   And Cheney, speaking at the National Defense University before
the meeting, said negotiating now with the Soviets over the
missiles would be a mistake because of the Soviets' overwhelming
superiority in non-nuclear forces.
   ``For the forseeable future, certainly as long as there is
overwhelming Soviet conventional superiority,'' Cheney said,
``there's absolutely no rationale at all for us to talk about
eliminating or significantly reducing those short-range forces.''
   The United States, Britain and France are concerned that
negotiating the missiles issue with the Soviets could wind up
depriving the NATO alliance of ground-based nuclear weaponry,
leaving the West Europeans vulnerable to stronger Warsaw Pact
conventional forces.
   Opponents of the missiles are concerned that having an arsenal
of Lances spurs their possible use and that a nuclear conflict
could not be confined to the battlefield but would spread to a
world-threatening war.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher will fly to Bonn on
Sunday to try to persuade Kohl to suspend his campaign for
U.S.-Soviet negotiations on the issue. Kohl has support among
several of the smaller NATO countries, including Norway, Belgium,
The Netherlands and Denmark.
   In another matter relating to NATO, Cheney disclosed Monday that
about half of the troop cuts he has ordered for the Army in fiscal
1990 will involve soldiers deployed to Europe.
   The defense chief, who delivered a speech at the National
Defense University Monday afternoon, said the cuts should not be
``perceived as any significant change in the U.S. commitment to
Europe.''
   Cheney explained he had ordered the Army to pare its ranks by
about 7,900 slots, and that about 4,000 represented troops ``that
have been previously assigned to Intermediate-range Nuclear
Forces.''
   The Army's Pershing II nuclear missile force is being withdrawn
from Europe and destroyed under terms of the INF Treaty with the
Soviet Union.
   ``There will be a reduction of a few thousand, but it's
basically in connection with bringing home the Pershing II
deployments,'' Cheney said.

   Animal rights activists on Monday began a week
of demonstrations nationwide against biomedical experiments on
laboratory animals. Medical and scientific researchers defended
their work as life-saving.
   The last week in April traditionally has been a week of activism
by groups that oppose use of animals in research experiments, and
``civil disobedience is definitely on the ticket across the
country'' this week, said Ingrid Newkirk, national director of
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.
   The groups, who have billed this as ``World Laboratory Animal
Liberation Week, are calling on the federal government and
universities to stop animal experiments and use research money
instead on other medical needs, including developing preventive
medicine strategies.
   ``At a time when there are so many human needs, to be playing
around with animals in the basements of universities seems not only
cruel to the animals, but wasteful of dollars,'' Newkirk said.
   She estimated the federal government spends as much as $6
billion a year on research using animals and said the results of
this research could be derived in ways that don't harm or kill
animals.
   Animal research advocates said other methods, such as computer
models, can supplement animal experimentation but will not replace
it any time soon.
   In defense of animal research, advocates say that most
experiments are not painful and that about 90 percent of the
animals used in such research are rodents bred specifically for lab
experimentation.
   Monday's protests focused on the National Institutes of Health
in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md. Protesters said NIH is
the world's largest source of financing for animal experimentation.
   Police arrested 50 or so of the 200 demonstrators after they
blocked traffic for about 30 minutes. Officers dragged many across
the road. Ginger Redmon, who said she had been arrested in two
other animal rights protests, said the civil disobedience ``shows
we have a strong commitment.''
   Although their ultimate goal is to stop all research
experimentation on animals, animal rights activists say that for
the immediate future they are seeking an end to the most blatant
cruelties, such as amputation of an animal's toe for the purpose of
identification.
   To defend their research, medical and scientific experimenters
are using this week as an opportunity to speak out in support of
the use of animals in medical research, pointing to the medical
breakthroughs such research has brought _ from coronary bypass
surgery to cataract removal, from vaccines to antibiotics.
   ``There's no such thing as anybody not having received some
benefit from animal research,'' said Frankie Trull, president of
the Foundation for Biomedical Research, a nonprofit group that
supports animal research.
   In a letter to President Bush and members of Congress, Dr. David
H. Hubel, president of the Society for Neuroscience, called for
researchers to ``make our case heard by the mass of sensible people
in this country.''
   Hubel said that while he and his fellow researchers ``strongly
condemn any unnecessary suffering of experimental animals,''
research on monkeys, cats and other animals in labs has produced
many medical advances that have cured diseases and saved lives.
   ``With tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria and a host of other
diseases largely solved, can we risk losing the opportunity to
discover cures for heart disease, cancer and AIDS?'' Hubel asked in
the letter.
   Dr. Louis Sullivan, the secretary of the health and human
services, said in a speech last week that he would ``do everything
possible'' to ensure the humane treatment of animals in the lab.
   ``But I will not let the integrity of our public health research
efforts be compromised by well organized efforts'' run by animal
rights activists, he said.

   Police used tear gas Monday to
disperse thousands of angry miners protesting plans to close
Belgium's two remaining coal pits.
   A police official, not identified in line with regulations, said
28 policemen were injured and nine were hospitalized. He said
several miners also were injured but he had no figures.
   The miners were protesting plans to close the two mines by 1993.
Earlier plans would not have shut down the mines until 1996.
   Miners said early closings would endanger their social benefits.
   The protesting miners first went to the headquarters of the KS
coal firm, where some entered the building and smashed windows and
furniture.
   Later they blocked a main road in the mining region of the
eastern province of Limburg, and fighting erupted when police moved
in to disperse them.
   Many miners were armed with iron bars, stones and chains. Police
used tear gas and water cannons.
   As the miners retreated one policeman, standing beside an
injured colleague, drew his pistol and fired into the air.
   ``About four shots were fired, but nobody was injured in the
incident,'' the police official said.

<TEXT>
   University of Utah chemist B. Stanley Pons
said Monday that he and British colleague Martin Fleischmann plan a
new round of experiments to expand their research on
room-temperature nuclear fusion.
   One experiment will be five times larger than the table-top
experiment the scientists used to produce what they claim is
nuclear fusion.
   Pons declined to detail the new experiments, but said he planned
to begin up to 20 over the next two weeks to supplement the four
currently operating.
   Among them will be tests of different metals than the palladium
used in the original experiments and new designs for the apparatus.
   Pons and Fleischmann have used electrically charged rods of
palladium in a beaker of deuterium oxide, which they said produced
up to eight times the energy consumed.
   ``I think this round of experiments will bring up a host of new
data,'' Pons told reporters at a briefing before his departure for
Washington D.C., where he and Fleischmann will address a
congressional committee about their controversial experiments.
   The larger experiment could be another step toward a practical
application for the heat, and therefore energy, of fusion, Pons
said.
   He estimated it might take 20 years to design and build a pilot
plant for usable fusion energy, which scientists say would be
cheaper and cleaner than the fission that currently fuels nuclear
reactors.
   Pons and Fleischmann stunned the scientific world March 23 when
they announced the results of their experiment, which was conducted
in a university laboratory. Several laboratories around the United
States and abroad have since claimed to duplicate or approximate
the results, although other experts remain skeptical.
   University spokeswoman Pam Fogle said Sunday the two researchers
were asked to appear Wednesday before the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee to discuss their fusion process and answer
questions.
   A congressional delegation also will visit the Utah campus in
mid-May.

   An astronaut scheduled to command a space
shuttle flight next year and two high NASA officials announced
their resignations Monday, with two saying their decisions were
prompted by new federal retirement regulations.
   Astronaut Jon A. McBride, 45, announced he will retire from NASA
on May 12 and will retire from the Navy in ``the near future.''
   Noel W. Hinners, the third-ranking executive in NASA, said he
will retire on May 14, the day before new post-retirement
regulations for government employees go into effect.
   James B. Odom, 55, chief of NASA's space station program,
announced he is retiring next Sunday and blamed the sudden decision
on ``the impact of some upcoming changes on government retirees.''
   McBride, a captain in the Navy, was scheduled to command the
STS-35 space shuttle mission set for launch next March. NASA
announced that veteran astronaut Vance D. Brand would take over
that job.
   McBride was selected as an astronaut in 1978 and flew into space
one time, as pilot on an October 1984 shuttle mission. He had been
scheduled to command a mission in March 1986, but the flight was
deferred when the shuttle fleet was grounded following the Jan. 28,
1986, explosion of space shuttle Challenger.
   ``I've spent an extremely rewarding 25 years with NASA and the
Navy,'' McBride said in a statement released by the Johnson Space
Center in Houston. ``This move has been a very difficult decision
for me. But in the final analysis, I felt it was time to make a
career change and return to West Virginia.''
   Hinners blamed his decision to retire on what he called
``uncertainty in interpretation of new post-employment laws.''
   A geologist and geochemist, Hinners served as chief scientist
for NASA. He began his space career in 1963 by helping to plan the
scientific exploration of the moon during the Apollo program. He
later served as director of the National Air and Space Museum in
Washington and director of the Goddard Space Flight Center. Hinners
joined the NASA senior management team in Washington in 1987.
   Odom, a 33-year veteran of NASA, has headed the space station
program for a year. The agency is in the midst of a major push to
persuade Congress to budget funds for starting construction on the
station.
   ``I regret the timing of my decision, but the impact of some
upcoming changes on government retirees made it such that I did not
get to pick the most desirable or optimum time to retire,'' said
Odom in a statement.
   Odom started his space career as a rocket engineer with the Army
in 1956, and transferred to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in
1959. He helped to develop the external tank used on the space
shuttle and the space telescope which will be launched next year.
   A spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said that regulations going into effect May 15 will
restrict the freedom of retired NASA executives to go to work for
commercial aerospace companies.
   The spokesman, who asked not to be named, also said that some
NASA officials feel they must leave before the rules take effect
``to take care of their families.''
   ``There will probably be some more (resignations),'' the
spokesman said.

   President Bush, in a letter released Monday,
said it would be ``imprudent to tinker'' with the Medicare
catastrophic insurance plan even in light of an unexpected surplus
in the program's revenues.
   The letter, released by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said that
based on the most recent projections, financial reserves for the
program ``are not excessive'' and may actually be ``too thin.'' The
projections, Bush said, are based on estimating uncertainties in a
program that is only a few months old.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, last week raised the possibility of a reduction of up to
16 percent in the surtax paid by many older Americans to finance
the insurance program, which provides extended coverage for a major
prolonged illness.
   Bentsen said that revised revenue estimates from the
Congressional Budgt Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation show
the government may be collecting more money than it needs for the
program. The figures, he said, indicate a $4.9 billion surplus for
the period 1989-1993.
   Bush confirmed that the revenue estimates project more money
than had originally been anticipated. But he noted uncertainties in
the program remain, including a projection by the Reagan
administration that the portion of the program that will pay for
drug benefits was underfunded. The cost of that portion of the
program is to be reestimated this summer, he said.
   ``It would be imprudent to tinker with Medicare catastrophic
insurance literally in its first few months of life,'' Bush said in
the letter. ``We should not now reopen the legislation.''
   Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, embraced Bush's statement and urged his colleagues ``to
carefully consider the points raised by the president before
pursuing legislation to amend the act.''
   He noted that premiums collected under the program are used to
pay only for benefits in the program or to reduce premiums in
future years.
   ``If premium collections do exceed our original expectation, the
amounts collected will still go to serve the beneficiaries and for
no other purpose,'' he said.

<HEAD>Britain Calls South African Envoy on Carpet Over Missile Secrets
Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Office complained to South Africa on
Monday over allegations that a South African diplomat was involved
in trying to trade British missile secrets for weapons for Northern
Ireland Protestant extremists. ``We take an extremely serious view
of the facts so far disclosed,'' Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe told the House of Commons, discussing Friday's arrest by
French police of three Northern Ireland Protestant extremists.
   The three were caught in a Paris hotel room with an American
businessman and a Paris-based South African diplomat while
purportedly delivering parts of a British Blowpipe missile to the
South African.
   The shoulder-fired Blowpipe, sometimes compared to the U.S.-made
Stinger, weighs about 45 pounds and fires 76mm guided
surface-to-air missiles.
   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quoted
government sources as saying concern existed over the possibility
that South Africa supplied arms to the extremists in return for
information about the missile, which is manufactured in Belfast.
   The Northern Ireland trio _ Noel Little, 40; Samuel Quinn, 41
and James King, 50 _ and the American, Douglas Bernhart, were
charged in Paris on Sunday with illegal transport and possession of
arms and terrorist conspiracy, British officials said Monday,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Daniel Storm, a South African Embassy staff member in Paris,
claimed diplomatic immunity and was released after brief
questioning.
   The Northern Irish, who are British subjects, were held in
custody, a British Embassy spokesman in Paris said. The American,
described in some British reports as a Swiss-based ``arms
adviser,'' was also ordered held, the Paris newspaper Liberation
reported Monday.
   In Dublin, the government announced its own protest to the South
Africans after Irish Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan studied a
report sent from the Irish Embassy in Paris.
   He also said he was seriously concerned at the ability of
Protestant paramilitaries to obtain weapons and sensitive military
material in Northern Ireland.
   Gerald Kaufman, foreign affairs spokesman of the opposition
Labor Party, asked Howe to consult with other European foreign
ministers for united action to expel all South African intelligence
agents and arms purchasers ``posing as diplomats.''
   Kaufman said South African weapons already were used in killings
in Northern Ireland's sectarian conflict and South African grenades
were thrown at police in the province. Howe said he could not
``offer any concluded judgment on that today.''
   Howe said South African Ambassador Rae Killen was called in and
told of the ``grave view taken by the British government.''
   Howe said he could not confirm a suggestion by lawmaker Menzies
Campbell that South Africa was apparently ready to pay $1.7 million
for a Blowpipe missile.
   ``It goes without saying that the South African authorities are
prepared to go to very considerable lengths to try to outwit the
United Nations arms embargo'' on South Africa, he said.
   South Africa, under international arms embargo because of its
racial segregation policies, has developed its own sophisticated
arms-manufacturing capacity. British news reports say the South
Africans agreed to supply multimillion-dollar small-arms shipments
or money to the Protestant extremists in return for blueprints of
sophisticated British missiles, which Armscor, the South African
state arms manufacturer, would then copy.
   In Pretoria, South Africa, Foreign Minister Pik Botha and
Defense Minister Magnus Malan said Monday that the South African
government is not supplying arms to any terrorist organization but
must consider offers of weapons technology because of the arms
embargo.
   One London newspaper, The Independent, ran a front page story
Monday saying South Africa delivered a major arms shipment to
Protestant militants in Northern Ireland in January in return for
Blowpipe technology.
   The Independent, quoting unidentified police sources, said South
African arms were used by a Protestant who attacked an Irish
Republican Army funeral in March last year, killing three people.
   The Independent and other London newspapers said that in return
for the arms, the Protestant extremists promised blueprints of
missile technology.
   Short Brothers, the state-owned manufacturer of the Blowpipe,
reported several thefts in recent months. Belfast police also said
a display model of a Blowpipe, without working parts, was stolen
from a British army center in Newtownards, County Down, this month.
   The arrested Protestants belonged to Ulster Resistance, a
shadowy organization formed in 1986 in opposition to an Anglo-Irish
accord granting the Irish government a say in Northern Ireland's
affairs on behalf of the province's Catholic minority.

   Some of the nation's top law enforcement
officials worked in the dark, so to speak, Monday because
construction crews couldn't connect an emergency generator
supplying power to part of the Justice Department.
   Electrical power to the southwest portion of the Justice
Department building was knocked out last week when a power cable
was severed by construction crews installing anti-terrorist
security barriers on the west side of the building, said
spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade.
   Power was restored about 6 p.m. but the outage inconvenienced
many top officials for most of the business day.
   A large generator inside a tractor-trailer was plugged into the
building to provide power. But crews had trouble reconnecting the
generator Monday, leaving the office of Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and some of his top deputies without power, she said.
   ``We are fortunate this occurred on a day the A.G. is in sunny
California,'' said David Runkel, an aide to Thornburgh, who was
meeting with Drug Enforcement Administration officials in Los
Angeles.
   Runkel said the blackout played havoc with the telehone system
in the attorney general's office, making it impossible to transfer
calls.
   When Thornburgh calls to check in, ``the secretary comes down
the hall and we gather at a phone where he is available,'' Runkel
said.
   Downstairs in the criminal division, the phones were not ringing
because of the power outage. ``Some of the secretaries are picking
up phones at random,'' said spokesman Joe Krovisky. ``They have
caught or 10 calls that way.''
   To reach John C. Keeney, deputy assistant attorney general,
criminal division lawyers were told to dial his beeper. Keeney then
returned telephone messages received on his beeper, Krovisky said.

<HEAD>NATO Chief for Missile Modernization; Bush Talks to Thatcher</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Manfred Woerner of NATO said
Monday the alliance must modernize its short-range nuclear
missiles, an issue that has divided the members, but he also said
compromise is possible.
   A British official said privately that President Bush telephoned
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and that they discussed the
question for 20 minutes.
   He said Bush telephoned on Saturday, a day after West Germany
urged early negotiations between the superpowers on eliminating
short-range missiles. Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of
West Germany and Gerhard Stoltenberg, the defense minister, flew to
Washington on Monday for talks with U.S. officials.
   A spokesman in Mrs. Thatcher's office at 10 Downing St. gave no
details of her conversation but said she and Bush ``concentrated on
the short-range missile issue.''
   Woerner, a former West German defense minister, said at a
luncheon meeting of the American Correspondents in London that
NATO's ``nuclear and conventional weapons have to be kept up to
date.''
   Possible compromises between West German resistance and U.S. and
British pressure to modernize include a reduction by NATO in its
nuclear artillery shells after the short-range missiles are
modernized, he said.
   ``That could be part of a solution,'' Woerner told the
journalists, ``but I'm not pleading now for negotiations on nuclear
artillery.''
   Polls in West Germany, where the short-range Lance missiles are
based, show strong opposition to modernizing them.
   Woerner also confirmed, in answer to a question, that Mrs.
Thatcher's government is considering deployment in Britain of more
U.S. F-111 bombers, which are capable of firing air-launched cruise
nuclear missiles.
   That would help compensate for the removal of land-based cruise
and Pershing 2 rockets under a U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove
intermediate-range missiles from Europe.
   In an apparent reference to fears by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
center-right coalition government of losing the 1990 election if it
agrees to modernize the missiles, Woerner said: ``It is the task of
a government not to follow public opinion, but to lead it.''
   He was the West German defense minister in the early 1980s when
NATO deployed the cruise and Pershing 2 missiles despite much
public opposition.
   Bush's call to Mrs. Thatcher underlined U.S. and British concern
about the latest West German move.
   Agreement to modernize, with a delay, was reached in Brussels
last week by the alliance's Nuclear Planning Group. A few hours
later, West Germany urged that the United States and Soviet Union
negotiate the elimination of short-range nuclear missiles.
   Britain and the United States say there can be no East-West
negotiations on short-range missiles until agreements are reached
on conventional and chemical weapons.

   Israelis wielding clubs and iron bars smashed
Arab cars and shops after their buses were stoned Monday in the
West Bank. Arab reports said soldiers wounded 21 Palestinians
during clashes in the Gaza Strip.
   It was the second report in two days of Israelis carrying out
revenge attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank.
   In Washington, a State Department official said the United
States was deeply concerned over a recent increase in casualties in
the 16-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   An army officer, meanwhile, was convicted of stoning Palestinian
vehicles in the West Bank village of Beit Sahour where he was
posted as a lookout, the army announced Monday. An army spokesman
would not give the officer's name and rank or say what his
punishment was. Army radio said he was given a 42-day suspended
sentence.
   The army confirmed ``a couple of Israelis'' attacked cars and
shops in Hebron after Palestinian youths threw stones at their
buses during a visit to a Mearat Hamakhpela, a cave believed to be
the burial cite of biblical Jewish leaders.
   The cave also is a sacred site to Moslems.
   Arab reporters said the Israelis smashed all the windows in at
least 15 cars and a Hebron shopkeeper said six stores in the city
were damaged.
   ``Some youths stoned the bus, and most of the Israelis in the
buses got out carrying clubs and iron bars and started smashing the
cars parked in the street,'' said the shopkeeper, Marwan Abu
Shalyoun. ``I went to one man and tried to stop him from smashing
my car, but a soldier ordered me back to my shop.''
   An army spokesman, who cannot be identified under military
regulations, said soldiers trying to break up the confrontation
were attacked by the Israelis. He said several Israelis were
arrested.
   Israel army radio said the Israelis were hikers from the Tel
Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva.
   There were no injuries in the incident, the spokesman said, but
the army declared a curfew on the city of 79,000 people.
   The incident followed a reported attack Saturday by 15 Jewish
settlers from Nili who allegedly burned and shot up Palestinian
buildings in the village of Harbata in response to a stone-throwing
attack.
   The settlers, who have denied their involvement, were ordered to
report for questioning Monday.
   The 21 Palestinians reported wounded Monday in clashes with the
army were from six Gaza Strip refugee camps and a Gaza City
district, Arab doctors said.
   Army officials said did not confirm any of the reported
casualties Monday but confirmed four of 53 Palestinians that Arab
hospital officials said were wounded the day before.
   The army reported soldiers killed a Palestinian on Sunday in a
raid on the West Bank village of Deir Sudan. Arab reporters said he
was killed Sunday night when soldiers fired on youths throwing
stones.
   The death brought to 444 the number of Palestinians killed in
the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have been killed.
   Palestinian reporters said Arab shepherds found the body of a
22-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank village of Tamoun who
had been stabbed to death and his eyes gouged out. Villagers said
Rifhi Mohammed Oude was seen being led from his home Sunday night
by masked Palestinians, but it was not clear why he had been killed.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiler
said: ``The increase in tensions runs directly counter to the cause
of peace. ... We remain determined to work with all parties to
break out of the current confrontation and to replace violence with
political dialogue and accommodation.''
   Extreme rightists were blamed for threats or attacks aimed at an
Israeli publisher and two left-wing politicians.
   Terrorists set fire to the door of an apartment belonging to
Amos Shocken, a publisher of the Haaretz and Hadashot newspapers.
Israel radio reported an anonymous telephone caller said the attack
was carried out by the Sicarites, a Jewish underground group,
because ``Shocken harms the morals of the Israeli people.''
   Hadashot said Yossi Sarid, a member of parliament from the
Citizens Rights Movement, receivewd several death threats Sunday
from a caller claiming to be a member of the Sicarites. Sarid has
recommended negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Avraham Zimmerman of the leftist Mapam party said assailants
slashed the tires of his car and plastered it with stickers from
the anti-Arab Kach Party of Rabbi Meir Kahane.

   The 8-year-old daughter of the leader
of a disciplinary group for ghetto children was beaten more than
500 times as an example to others before she died, a prosecutor
alleged Monday.
   Dayna Broussard was beaten in a garage used by the Ecclesia
Athletic Association after she defied adults who tried to punish
her for taking food from another child's plate, said Alfred J.
French III, a deputy Clackamas County district.
   French, delivering his opening statement in the manslaughter
trial of four group members, said the punishment intensified over a
one- to two-hour period until the child was left gasping for
breath. When adults finally took the child to a fire station for
help early Oct. 14, she was dead.
   French said the victim's older brother was forced to count the
strokes as the punishment was administered with a rubber hose, an
electric cord, a piece of plastic pipe, a bamboo pole and a
weightlifting belt.
   More than 50 other children in the group were forced to watch,
he said.
   And at one point, defendant Constance Jackson bit the girl on
the cheek, and, with her teeth, lifted her from the cement floor
``and shook her like a dog,'' French said.
   Monday's opening arguments followed 11 weeks of jury selection
in one of the most highly publicized criminal cases in Oregon
history.
   The father of the dead girl, Eldridge Broussard Jr., is expected
to testify for the defense. Broussard was in Los Angeles when his
daughter was killed.
   Broussard has said he formed the association to divert
inner-city children from a life of drugs and crime through
athletics and tough discipline.
   In their opening statements, attorneys for two of the four
defendants reminded jurors that Ecclesia's home base, the Watts
Christian Center, was surrounded by violence in the Los Angeles
ghetto.
   Jack Bernstein, the attorney for defendant Frederick P.
Doolittle, said members of the mostly black group were different
from the all-white jury because of their race and because of the
way they had to live among drug dealers and prostitutes in the
crime-ridden Watts district.
   Separate trials before a single jury are being held for
Doolittle, 28, Jackson, 38, and Brian J. Brinson, 31, all of Los
Angeles; and Willie K. Chambers, 35, of San Diego. The trial went
on in Oregon City after Circuit Judge John Lowe refused to move it
to another county.
   Dayna Broussard was one of more than 50 children brought to the
foothills of Mount Hood, east of Portland, last year while the
Watts Christian Center was being renovated.

<HEAD>Evening On Rushdie Postponed Due To Bomb and Murder Threats</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Organizers on Monday postponed a
discussion on the novel ``The Satanic Verses'' after participants
received bomb and murder threats, a spokesman said.
   In Paris, a writer has published a pirated translation of the
novel by British author Salman Rushdie and said Monday he will
personally deliver a copy to the Iranian Embassy on Tuesday.
   ``Death threats, I couldn't care less,'' Jean-Edern Hallier told
a news conference.
   Some Moslems say Rushdie's novel blasphemes Islam because it
includes a brothel scene in which the prostitutes take the names of
the prophet Mohammed's wives and because it suggests Mohammed wrote
the holy Koran instead of receiving it from God.
   On Feb. 14, Iran's revolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, called for Rushdie to be put to death. The Indian-born
author has been in hiding since then.
   Monday's discussion in Vienna, entitled ``Salman Rushdie, The
Satanic Verses, Opposition and Liquidation'' was to include a
reading from the book and a discussion including Iranian
participants and a representative of the human rights group Amnesty
International, organizers said.
   Wolfgang Weiss, a spokesman for a university students union
sponsoring the program, said the Iranian participants had received
death threats and the university adminstration had received bomb
threats.
   A statement issued by the organizers said that the event was
being postponed because it was no longer possible to guarantee the
safety of the audience or participants.
   It gave no date for the event to be rescheduled.
   Hallier, who distributed typed copies of the book to reporters,
said he published a French translation of ``The Satanic Verses'' to
``save the honor of French publishing.''
   He accused publisher Christian Bourgois, who holds French rights
to the work, of dragging his feet out of fear of reprisal from
Moslem fanatics.
   Following the death sentence pronounced on Rushdie, Bourgois
announced he would not publish the book. He later changed his mind
and said the book would appear.
   On a request filed by attorneys representing Bourgois, a court
in the southern French city of Montpelier ordered copies of the
pirated book seized from a printer on Saturday. A Paris court has
ordered the immediate seizure of any copies of the pirated book
that appear on newsstands.
   But Hallier said 1,000 copies that were printed at another
location would be distributed Tuesday, including one he would
deliver Tuesday to the Iranian ambassador to France.
   He said he planned a countersuit against Bourgois and that
50,000 more copies of the manuscript would be distributed
throughout Paris Wednesday as a supplement to his magazine, ``Idiot
International.''
   The book has caused protests worldwide, and demonstrations over
its publication have led to the deaths of at least 19 people in
Pakistan and India.

<HEAD>Soviets To Allow Outside Investigations of Human Rights Complaints</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet official said Monday the Soviet
Union plans to sign an accord that would allow its citizens to take
human rights complaints to international investigators.
   Moscow will sign the Optional Protocol to the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights later this year or early
next year, said the official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Accepting that pact would mean Soviet citizens could appeal to
the U.N.-affiliated Human Rights Committee in cases involving
emigration, torture, forced labor, arbitrary arrest or detention,
freedom of thought and conscience, and peaceful assembly.
   The official said the Soviet government has been considering
signing the pact for some time, and various government ministries
have been reviewing the effect it would have.
   ``There is an intention,'' he said.
   Some of the agencies studying the matter are the Ministry of
Justice, the Public Prosecutor's Office, and the Ministry of the
Interior, he added.
   Soviet acceptance of the protocol would be a dramatic extension
of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's declaration last December that
human rights should be given new emphasis in international affairs.
   In March the Soviet Union said it would accept the World Court's
jurisdiction in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and five other human rights treaties that bar slavery,
prostitution, torture and genocide and guarantee women's rights.
   That decision reversed a Soviet post-World War II policy of
resisting outside scrutiny of its practices.
   However, only governments can appeal to the World Court at the
Hague.
   When nations sign the Optional Protocol, their citizens can file
complaints with the Human Rights Committee, an international body
of legal specialists with the power to order compensation.
   Hungary ratified the protocol last year, joining 40 other
nations.
   Of the six major human rights treaties, the United States has
ratified only one, outlawing genocide, and has not accepted World
Court authority in that treaty.
   Acceptance of the Optional Protocol should help the Soviet
effort to hold a human rights conference in Moscow in 1991 as one
of several follow-up meetings to the 1975 Helsinki agreements on
European security and cooperation.

<HEAD>Attorney Contends Authorities Trying To Entrap Him Into Betraying
Clients</HEAD>

   A lawyer accused of receiving a stolen Uzi
submachine gun sought to have the charge dismissed Monday,
contending he was the target of an entrapment scheme by authorities
to force him to betray his clients.
   Attorney Robin Auld's lawyer, Hal Haddon, asked Montrose
District Judge Richard Brown to dismiss the charge because of
``outrageous misconduct'' by District Attorney Victor Reichman and
other law enforcement officials.
   Auld, 43, contends Reichman and law enforcement officials set
him up, arrested him Oct. 29, and later offered not to file charges
if he would agree to help them set up his own clients.
   Haddon has said the case is crucial to the attorney-client
relationship in Colorado.
   According to documents filed in the case, undercover Sheriff's
Deputy Brent Pace, posing as ``Colton Young,'' asked Auld, a
criminal defense lawyer, to represent him in a case.
   Auld won dismissal of the charges. The undercover officer
offered to pay Auld for his services with drugs, but the attorney
declined. Pace then offered him the Uzi, saying he told Auld it was
stolen. Auld said he agreed to hold the gun as security for the
money Pace owed him, according to the documents.
   The charges against ``Colton Young'' were false.
   Durango police Sgt. John Ball testified at Monday's pretrial
hearing that authorities were concerned about making false
statements to a court, ``but we never expected it would get that
far.''
   Reichman and Ball, who were questioned extensively by Haddon,
gave contradictory testimony.
   Reichman denied that he offered criminal suspects deals in
return for information on Auld. Ball, however, said Reichman agreed
not to file drunken driving charges against an informant in
exchange for help in the Auld investigation.
   Haddon also requested greater access to law enforcement files,
and sought to have tape recordings of conversations between Auld
and Pace thrown out.
   Under questioning, Reichman said there were no tape recordings
or notes on conversations he had with federal authorities about the
case.
   The district attorney said taping a federal prosecutor would be
highly inappropriate. ``I wouldn't think of such a thing,'' he said.
   Asked by Haddon how he felt about taping a conversation between
an attorney and a client, Reichman said, ``that would depend on the
circumstances.''
   The hearing was scheduled to continue Tuesday. Auld's trial is
scheduled to begin May 22.
   Haddon has also filed an intent to sue Reichman and others on
behalf of Auld for at least $1 million.

   Investigators of Pan Am Flight 103, destroyed by a
bomb over Scotland, believe they have uncovered a series of
international crimes whose proceeds finance terrorists, The Times
of London reported Monday.
   It said the investigators found links between robberies that
netted $11 million in Denmark and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine- General Command, which some accuse of
planning the Dec. 21 bombing that killed 270 people.
   Detectives are trying to trace the source of tens of millions of
dollars hidden in secret accounts that have made some terrorists
``enormously rich and powerful,'' The Times reported.
   Inspector Thomas McCulloch of the international investigation
based in Lockerbie, Scotland, said: ``We're aware of an ongoing
investigation by the Danish and it would be quite improper for us
to comment any further at this time.''
   Investigators believe the money has been used to ``create
terrorism schools, to buy sophisticated equipment and explosives
and develop new ways of beating airline security systems,'' The
Times reported.
   The paper said police found links between terrorists arrested in
West Germany in October, with radio-cassette players rigged as
bombs like the one that destroyed Flight 103, and the $11 million
stolen in Denmark. It said the money went to the Popular Front.
   Seven people were arrested, including two of Middle East
extraction, in Copenhagen but Danish courts have not confirmed the
theories, according to the report.
   Samuel Skinner, the U.S. transportation secretary, is expected
to discuss airport security with Paul Channon, his British
counterpart, when Skinner arrives Thursday at the end of a
week-long tour of Italy, West Germany, Switzerland and France.

   Eastern Airlines would slash daily service by 29
percent and sell $1.8 billion in assets under a new business plan
presented to creditors of the strike-crippled airline Monday.
   The proposal, which must be approved by creditors and a federal
bankruptcy court, calls for Eastern to reduce its fleet size to 157
aircraft from the present 255 and the number of cities served to 77
from a pre-strike 102.
   The number of daily scheduled flight hours would be cut to 1,473
from 2,076 under the plan.
   Eastern has been flying substantially reduced schedules since a
March 4 strike by its Machinists, which was joined by Eastern's
pilots and flight attendants unions. The company sought bankruptcy
court protection from creditors on March 9.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., said
last week he would reorganize the airline by slashing pre-strike
operations and selling a substantial number of assets.
   Eastern President Phil Bakes would not specify all the cities
where Eastern would cut service, but he told a press briefing the
company would sell its Philadelphia hub, a total of 117 unspecified
airport gates and 28 landing slots. Eastern would also de-emphasize
some foreign routes.
   Bakes said Eastern would keep its Atlanta hub, which accounts
for 35 percent to 40 percent of total revenue, in addition to
traditional Northeast-to-Florida routes. It would also maintain
some service to the Caribbean.
   Employment at the scaled-down Eastern would total some 17,000
workers, down from a pre-strike 30,000, Bakes said. The total would
include 1,700 pilots, down from 3,600 before the strike, he said.
   Paul Dombroski, a spokesman for the Machinists in Miami, said
the plan was similar to one used by Texas Air carrier Continental
Airlines in 1983, ``and it didn't work over there. ... We in the
Machinists union don't feel they can make it work at Eastern
Airlines either.''
   Eastern indicated that by yearend under the plan it would have
$1.8 billion in net cash from asset sales, giving it a net cash
balance of $774 million.
   Lorenzo has insisted he no longer is interested in selling all
of Eastern, following the collapse of a proposed $464 million deal
with a group led by former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland and Eastern's unions
have been pushing for a sale.
   Separately, a bankruptcy examiner said Monday that further bids
to acquire Eastern could be made as early as this week by suitors
who include hotel executive Jay Pritzker and Trans World Airlines
Chairman Carl C. Icahn.
   Examiner David I. Shapiro said at a bankruptcy court hearing
that he had ``numerous interviews'' with parties interested in
buying the airline from Texas Air and confirmed earlier reports
that Pritzker had been given access to confidential financial data
concerning the airline.
   Shapiro also said TWA officials had expressed interest in
getting access to the financial data.
   Shapiro told Lifland at a hearing that in addition to Pritzker
and Icahn two major financial institutions had emerged as new
serious bidders for Eastern, but he declined to give details.
   The two institutions could submit bids this week or next,
Shapiro said.
   Lifland postponed until May 3 a hearing scheduled for Monday on
why Eastern shouldn't be sold in its entirety in an open auction.
Such a deal would include Eastern's Northeast shuttle service,
which the company already has agreed to sell to developer Donald
Trump for $365 million.
   The delay was intended to give potential buyers more time to
examine Eastern's financial data and to give parties involved in
the airline's bankruptcy case more time to negotiate over a
possible reorganization plan.
   The delay also was intended to give Shapiro more time to study
documents submitted by Eastern management and unions regarding
previous financial transactions between Miami-based Eastern and
Texas Air.

<HEAD>Second Man Convicted in Supermarket Killings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young man described as a ``coldblooded
killer'' was found guilty Monday of murdering five people in a 1987
supermarket hold-up by two gunmen who authorities say posed as
cleaning men.
   A Circuit Court jury convicted Donnie Blankenship, 27, of five
counts of second-degree murder and one count each of robbery,
unlawful use of a weapon and receiving stolen property.
   Blankenship faces a maximum sentence of 205 years in prison.
Sentencing was scheduled for June 8.
   Prosecutors had sought first-degree murder convictions, which
could have resulted in a death sentence.
   Blankenship's attorney, Linda Murphy, said she would appeal, but
said she considered the verdict a victory. She said the jury
apparently believed her client was involved in the robbery but was
not the triggerman.
   Special prosecutor Garrett L. Randall agreed the jury must have
had some doubt about Blankenship's role in the slayings.
   In his closing argument, Randall called Blankenship a
``coldblooded killer'' who deserved the death penalty.
   The jury reached its decision late Monday morning after
deliberations that began Saturday. The panel did not meet Sunday.
   On Sept. 4, 1987, two men entered the National Supermarket after
closing time, apparently by posing as a cleaning crew, police said.
Six store employees and a security guard were forced to lie on the
floor, then were shot. The two who survived testified at
Blankenship's trial.
   The other gunman, Marvin Jennings, 27, was convicted last
September of 16 felony counts, including five counts of first
degree murder. He was sentenced to five consecutive life prison
terms without parole.
   Chris Brown, whose mother, head cashier Rose M. Brown, 49, was
among those slain, expressed satisfaction about Monday's verdict.
   ``I think all of us are more or less glad it's over now,'' Brown
said. ``The verdict is in and we know that Donnie Blankenship, like
Marvin Jennings, will be off the street for quite some time.''

   Amnesty International appealed Tuesday to 100
countries, including the United States and Iran, to abolish the
death penalty, calling it an arbitrary ``judicial lottery'' that
does not deter crime.
   The human rights group, in a study of capital punishment
worldwide, says it is slanted against the poor, ethnic minorities
and political opponents of the government.
   Amnesty International recorded 15,320 executions in 90 countries
in the past decade but said they often are done in secret. It said
other estimates put the number as high as 40,000.
   Victims ranged in age from 14 to 76, with the United States
among six countries that have executed juveniles under age 18, the
group said.
   However, it cited only cases in which U.S. authorities executed
adults for crimes committed when they were juveniles.
   Of the 100 men and women executed in U.S. prisons since the
Supreme Court in 1976 allowed states to resume capital punishment,
three died for murders committed when they were 17.
   The death penalty is used in some countries not just to punish
murder, but also adultery, prostitution, showing pornographic
films, bribery, corruption, embezzlement, kidnapping, rape, robbery
and drug-trafficking, Amnesty said. Victims include non-violent
political prisoners and the mentally ill.
   Amnesty International said most governments justified the death
penalty as a deterrent, but this ``is not borne out by facts.''
   ``Nowhere has it been shown that the death penalty has any
special power to reduce crime or political violence,'' it said,
because those who commit murder don't always count the consequences
beforehand.
   Amnesty International said thousands have been put to death in
20 countries after unfair trials. Methods of execution, sometimes
akin to torture, include hanging, shooting, gassing, electrocution,
poisoning, beheading and stoning, and Amnesty International said:
   ``It is a particularly cruel, calculated and cold-blooded form
of killing ... It is imposed to punish prisoners for their
political beliefs and when inflicted for criminal offenses it often
becomes a judicial lottery.''
   It cited the case of a Thai construction worker who took more
than nine minutes to strangle to death in 1981 because he wasn't
heavy enough to cause the noose to break his neck.
   In the state of Georgia, it said, Alpha Otis Stephens survived
the first two-minute charge of electricity in 1984 and struggled
for breath for eight minutes before being killed by a second charge.
   The report said even the newest American method of execution _
lethal injection _ has caused prolonged agony. It said the tube
attached to the needle began to leak during the 1988 execution of
Raymond Landry and the chemical being injected spurted out because
the pressure in the hose was greater than his veins could absorb.
It said witnesses reported hearing groans in the 17 minutes before
Landry died.
   Amnesty International, which opposes execution as cruel and a
denial of the right to life, said it also objects to the ``unique
horror'' experienced by condemned prisoners awaiting an unknown
execution date.
   Its survey found some prisoners were executed within minutes of
sentencing, while political prisoners in Indonesia waited 25 years.
   Amnesty International said the death penalty has arbitrary and
discriminatory features that are inherent. While blacks are 12
percent of the U.S. population, they account for 40 percent of the
record 2,182 prisoners on death row as of December.
   ``The evidence suggests that race, especially that of the
victim, has an important bearing on the likelihood of a death
sentence being imposed, particularly in the southern states,'' the
report said.
   In South Africa, it said, death sentences are imposed
disproportionately on black defendants by the almost all-white
judiciary and that the vast majority of the 1,250 people executed
there in the past decade have been black.
   The report said unfair trials and executions often occur in
countries where the death penalty is an instrument of political
repression.
   It singled out Iran, where thousands of people, including
children, were reported executed for political reasons in the early
1980s, and another 1,200 in the second half of 1988. It said it
knows of no case in which a defendant before an Iranian Islamic
Revolutionary Court on a political charge was allowed a lawyer or
an appeal.
   Hundreds of executions after unfair trials were also reported in
Iraq, Turkey, Ethiopia, Ghana, Jordan, Cambodia and Somalia, it
said.
   Unfair trials have been reported in China where unofficial
sources say up to 30,000 were executed between 1983 and 1987, it
said.
   Amnesty International said death penalty statistics in the
Soviet Union have been secret since 1934, but it recorded 63
executions by shooting there between 1985 and mid-1988.

<HEAD>Khomeini Names Committee To Amend Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini named a
20-man committee Monday to amend Iran's constitution, Tehran radio
reported _ a move that could have far-reaching implications,
including the question of who will succeed the 88-year-old Khomeini
when he dies.
   The committee included President Ali Khamenei, Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi and Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani. It was
given two months to ``rectify the defects'' in the Islamic
Republic's 1980 constitution.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, said Khomeini announced the
committee's formation in a letter to Khamenei.
   ``After 10 years of experience in governing the country, many
authorities and officials ... are of the opinion that the
constitution ... contains defects and problems,'' he wrote.
   ``Rectifying these defects is an unavoidable necessity for our
Islamic and revolutionary society, and delays could cause
catastrophies and bitter results for the country and the
revolution.''
   Khomeini said officials had asked him to correct the
constitution's flaws and clarify its ambiguities, the radio said.
   This month, 160 members of the 270-seat Parliament urged
Khomeini to make constitutional changes. The Supreme Judicial
Council later endorsed that call.
   Khomeini said the constitutional amendments will be put to
Iran's electorate in a referendum. He did not say when.
   Among issues Khomeini said should be discussed were the
leadership question and the powers of the judiciary and executive
branches.
   Khomeini removed his designated successor, Ayatollah Hussein-Ali
Montazeri, last month, saying Montazeri had been duped by enemies
of the revolution.
   Montazeri, 64, demanded wider freedoms following the end of the
war with Iraq and asked that widespread executions of political
dissidents be halted.
   Political analysts believe no single individual, but a committee
of three to five leaders will run Iran in the post-Khomeini era.
   The new committee is to make the constitutional changes needed
to accommodate such a council.
   Khomeini is widely believed to favor this in the absence of
anyone of his stature or authority to take his place.
   Another major issue is executive branch power. An unclear
division of power exists between the presidency and the premiership.
   Rafsanjani has announced his candidacy for the presidency in
elections to be held in late summer. He reportedly wants the prime
minister's post abolished and the presidency strengthened to
eliminate competing power centers that have paralyzed the
decision-making process.
   The committee appeared to be more or less split evenly between
hardliners and so-called pragmatists.
   Others prominent figures chosen included Chief Justice Musavi
Ardebili, Deputy Parliament Speaker Mehdi Karrubi, Chief Justice
Ayatollah Musavi Ardebili and Prosecutor-General Musavi Khoeiniha.
   Absent, however, was Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi,
leader of the hard-line faction now in the ascendancy in Iran.
   Khomeini also asked the committee to clarify the role of the
Expediency Council. He formed that body in 1987 to resolve
differences between Parliament and the Council of Guardians, a
conservative-dominated watchdog body with the power to veto
parliamentary legislation it considers violate Islamic law.
   Radicals criticized the Expediency Council for sidestepping
Parliament by initiating and passing bills not approved by
Parliament.
   These included harsh new anti-narcotics laws that mandated the
death sentence for possession of small quantities of drugs.
   Khomeini also asked the committee to review the powers of the
management of the state-run Islamic Republic Radio and Television
network. This may mean the broadcast services face curbs because
hardliners believe they promote certain political leaders, such as
Rafsanjani, and exclude others.
   Rafsanjani, once considered the No. 2 man in Iran after
Khomeini, has slipped from favor as the radicals strengthened their
grip.
   He sought to build bridges with the West to end Iran's 10 years
of isolation, a move bitterly opposed by hard-line, anti-Western
rivals.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels blew up a gasoline
pipeline Monday in the fourth attack on Colombian petroleum
facilities within a week.
   The National Liberation Army, known as ELN, claimed
reponsibility for the attack, according to Ecopetrol, the
government's petroleum company.
   ELN has vowed to drive foreign oil companies out of Colombia and
last Tuesday its guerrillas bombed the country's largest oil
pipeline at three points. The oil line is still out of operation,
but Ecopetrol said service could be restored on Tuesday.
   A bomb damaged the gasoline pipeline near the town of La Cumbre,
175 miles west of Bogota, Ecopetrol said in a news release. It said
it expected the line would be quickly repaired and there would be
no shortage because of an ample supply of stored fuels.
   The pipeline carries 25,000 barrels of imported gasoline daily
from the Pacific port of Buenaventura to the eastern city of Cali.
   It was the 10th time this year that ELN rebels have attacked oil
installations in Colombia.
   The damaged oil pipeline carried an average 220,000 barrels
daily from the Canon Limon field in northeastern Colombia to the
Caribbean port of Covenas for export.
   The Canon Limon field is jointly operated by Ecopetrol, Royal
Dutch Shell and Occidental Petroleum.
   On Wednesday, ELN guerrillas attacked a drilling rig operated by
Ecopetrol and the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and kidnapped
four engineers _ three Brazilians and a Colombian. No demands have
been made public for the release of the victims.
   Two days later the same guerrilla unit raided a Colombian oil
company's camp in the northeast and stole a $17,000 payroll.

   Vice President Dan Quayle, embarking on a 12-day
trip to Australia and Southeast Asia, vowed Monday to address
``head-on ... concerns that the United States is a nation in
decline.''
   Before leaving the United States on his second trip abroad since
taking office, Quayle addressed the annual meeting of The
Associated Press.
   He told the newspaper publishers his trip to Asia was designed
to underscore the U.S. commitment to the Pacific rim and gain
``firsthand familiarity'' with the area.
   Moreover, he said some American and Asian observers wonder if
the United States ``is really a great nation in decline,'' with
high budget and trade deficits a sign of malaise.
   Those observers ask themselves, ``Can we (the United States)
still be relied on to play a leadership role in the Pacific? And,
if not, who else is there to replace us?
   ``An important purpose of my trip is to address these concerns
head on ...,'' Quayle said. ``The United States is focusing on the
region as never before.''
   He said he intends to remind the Asian allies ``that the current
wave of `declinist' thought in the United States is hardly a new
phenomenon.''
   Elaborating, the vice president said, ``Books predicting
America's imminent fall from world leadership have made the
best-seller list and prophets of American decline have become
virtual academic celebrities.
   ``All of this naturally arouses a good deal of apprehension
among our friends and allies in Asia.''
   He did not identify any ``declinists'' by name.
   Periodically, he said, waves of pessimism have swept the United
States. Yet, he added, such national introspection is healthy
because ``it's usually a sign of renewal, not of decline.''
   Quayle said the overall purpose of his whirlwind trip, which
will take him and his wife, Marilyn, to Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand as well as Australia, is to show that the United States
intends ``to play an important role in the Pacific.''
   In a question-and-answer session with the AP group, Quayle said
one of the things he's most enjoyed about his first 100 days in
office is his involvement in foreign policy.
   The vice president, who visited Central and South America soon
after he was inaugurated, said most of his trips as senator had
been back home to Indiana.
   From Chicago, Quayle flew to Los Angeles to meet with former
President Ronald Reagan before he left for Australia.
   Quayle and his wife met briefly with Reagan and his wife, Nancy,
at Reagan's office in a Los Angeles skyscraper. Posing for
photographers, Quayle presented a wrapped American flag to Reagan,
the same flag that had flown over the American embassy in Kabal,
Afghanistan, until the Soviet troops invaded in 1979.
   When the Soviets announced their attention to leve Afghanistan,
the flag was once again hoisted above the embassy on May 15, 1988.
   ``I'm very proud to have this...I have a feeling this will find
its way into the Ronald Reagan library,'' said the smiling former
Reagan.
   Reagan also said he thought President Bush had done a good job
in the first 100 days. ``He is there to keep in progress the things
we did for eight years,'' Reagan said.
   Later in the evening, Quayle was to receive an award presented
by Reagan's financial backers at a Republican fund-raiser.
   On his return to the United States, Quayle will tour Alaska's
Prince William Sound to see for himself cleanup efforts after the
March 24 grounding of the tanker Exxon Valdez, which dumped 10.1
million gallons of crude oil in the sound.
   Trade, space, defense, environmental pollution and chemical
warfare were issues Quayle said he would bring up with U.S. allies.
   His journey, in which he will combine substantive talks with
sightseeing and social events, is taking place shortly before the
first Sino-Soviet summit in 20 years. Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev is visiting China in May.
   ``We recognize the Soviet interest in sharing in Asia's economic
boom and in increasing its access to the region,'' he said.
   ``But Moscow has a long way to go to achieve that goal,'' he
said.
   However, he said, the Soviets continue to modernize military
forces in Asia and has one of its largest fleets stationed in Asia.

   Carmina Salcido, lavished with presents
on her third birthday, ate a piece of cake Monday as her first
solid food since her father allegedly slashed her throat and killed
her mother, two sisters and four others.
   Meanwhile, doubts surfaced over a sheriff's report that her
father, Ramon Salcido, molested two young sisters-in-law before
killing them and their mother in the April 14 rampage Salcido
blamed on jealous rage.
   Carmina, who was in good condition, enjoyed her party at
Petaluma Valley Hospital with 15 relatives, friends, doctors and
nurses, smiling happily and playing with toys brought into her room
on a new, red wagon.
   ``It was a really sweet, charming, little party,'' said hospital
spokeswoman Mary Frost. ``She was enjoying it thoroughly.
   ``The family is definitely a very strong family,'' Frost said.
``They're really holding together.''
   Carmina, who had a tracheotomy while surgeons repaired her slit
throat, had been eating only soft foods and has been unable to talk.
   On Monday, she was given a treat of strawberry ice cream and
vanilla birthday cake decorated with clowns. Carmina chose a corner
piece with extra frosting.
   Carmina, dressed in sneakers with hearts on them, lacy white
socks and a Minnie Mouse nightshirt, received a host of gifts. Her
favorites were a music-playing jewelry box, a 2-foot-tall Minnie
Mouse, coloring books and dishes.
   Gifts, cards, letters and telegrams continued to pour into the
hospital about 40 miles north of San Francisco. More than 500 gifts
from around the nation have been delivered, Frost said.
   Relatives at the party included her maternal grandfather, Bob
Richards, who lost his wife, three daughters and two granddaughters
Sunday that Carmina lay in a county garbage dump for more than 30
hours with her two slain sisters _ Sophia, 4, and Theresa, 1 _
before she was found April 15, the day after the rampage.
   Carmina apparently survived because, after her throat was cut,
she was thrown into the dump with her head down, which closed the
wound, the newspaper quoted sources as saying. Her sisters landed
with their heads thrown back, and died from their wounds.
   Meanwhile, District Attorney Gene Tunney said in nearby Santa
Rosa that he would ask that a gag order be temporarily lifted so he
could address the question of sexual molestation of Salcido's two
young sisters-in-law.
   Tunney was quoted in the Press Democrat as saying that initial
autopsy results showed no evidence of sexual assault, despite
statements by Sonoma County Sheriff Dick Michaelsen that the girls,
aged 8 and 12, were raped and sodomized in their mother's Cotati
home.
   ``Why that statement was made, I don't know,'' Tunney told the
newspaper. ``If it is not true, that should be known out of
fairness to Mr. Salcido and the families.''
   Final autopsy results are expected later this week.
   Salcido, who admitted the killings after his arrest in Mexico on
April 19, is charged in the girls' slayings and those of their
mother, his wife, Carmina's two sisters and a co-worker at his
winery. He also is charged with attempted murder in attacks on
Carmina and two other people at the winery.
   Salcido, 28, remains in the Sonoma County jail under a 24-hour
suicide watch. He is scheduled to enter a plea to the charges May 5.
   Neither Tunney nor Michaelsen would talk to reporters Monday
because of the gag order imposed by Municipal Judge Knoel Owen at
Salcido's arraignment Friday.
   Tunney said the sheriff may have based his statement on the
condition of the house where the killings occurred and the disarray
of the children's clothing.

   A small equipment room fire forced
the evacuation of about 600 workers from a building housing the
space shuttle launch control center Monday, but it was quickly
extinguished.
   NASA said the blaze would have no impact on Friday's scheduled
liftoff of Atlantis on a planetary mission.
   The fire was on the fourth floor in a room that supplies air
conditioning to part of the four-story building. The launch control
center is on the third floor.
   Space agency spokesman Dick Young said material used to insulate
equipment caught fire, but caused only ``minimal'' damage. The
workers were evacuated as a precaution and were back inside the
building within an hour. The blaze was under investigation.
   During the evacuation, he said, a skeleton crew remained in the
control center to monitor Atlantis' systems.
   On the launch pad, technicians closed the engine compartment and
checked the Magellan-Venus payload as Atlantis was readied for the
first space shuttle planetary mission.
   Space agency spokeswoman Lisa Malone reported the shuttle and
its cargo were in good shape and the countdown was set to begin on
time at 8 a.m. Tuesday. Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday.
   During their four-day flight, Atlantis' five astronauts are to
release the $378 million Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay,
starting it on a 468-day outward journey to Venus.
   The 7,600-pound craft is to fire into orbit around the
cloud-shrouded planet in August 1990 and map up to 90 percent of
its surface over the next 243 days with a high resolution radar
system.
   Magellan is the first new American planetary spacecraft since
Pioneer 13 was launched in 1978, also to Venus. It also is the
first planetary payload to be carried up by a shuttle.
   Commanding the astronaut crew is veteran shuttle pilot Dave
Walker. The others are pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists Mary
Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard. They will fly here Tuesday
from their training base in Houston to make final flight
preparations.

<TEXT>
   When Noboru Takeshita arrived at the pinnacle of
Japanese politics in November 1987, he was known as the best
money-raiser the Liberal Democratic Party had ever known. Now he
has been taken down by his field of expertise.
   Takeshita, buffeted by a scandal over political donations that
sent his opinion-poll ratings to rock bottom, decided Tuesday to
resign as prime minister, Chief Cabinet Secretary Keizo Obuchi said
in an announcement on live national television.
   The decision came after Takeshita was forced to acknowledge that
he had received even more money than he had previously admitted
from Recruit Co., the conglomerate at the center of a
money-politics scandal that has brought the resignations of three
of his Cabinet ministers and the arrests of 14 people on charges of
bribery and securities law violations.
   Takeshita, 65, had admitted to Parliament that he received more
than $1 million in what he called legal donations from Recruit.
Then news reports over the weekend said he also had borrowed
$381,000 from Recruit in 1987. Takeshita on Sunday said the report
was true.
   At the time of the loan, Takeshita was finance minister and
campaigning to succeed Yasuhiro Nakasone as president of the
governing Liberal Democrats and prime minister.
   Takeshita was regarded as a quiet political operator, in
contrast to Nakasone's flamboyant internationalism. His strengths
have been in patience, administration and back-room politics _
consensus-building, Japanese style.
   Some doubted his under-the-table political methods would serve
Japan well in an international context, but he defeated his rivals
in a campaign that left him with a reputation as the best
fund-raiser the conservative party had.
   He embarked on a continuation of Nakasone's policy of opening
Japan to outside influences and imported goods, plus an expansion
of the domestic economy to reverse the country's dependence on
exports.
   Under his administration Japan announced a vast expansion in aid
to underdeveloped countries, surpassing the United States as an aid
donor. Tokyo won an improved reputation as a responsible and
concerned member of the international community.
   But last summer Takeshita came under increasing fire as the
Recruit scandal unfolded with revelations that he and other
politicians as well as bureaucrats and business and media leaders
had profited from transactions in Recruit shares.
   Takeshita's name, however, was not on the transactions, which
were done in the names of an aide and a relative. The profit on the
12,000-share transactions was estimated at a total of $192,000.
   The conglomerate, allegedly seeking favors and influence, had
offered bargain-priced shares in a real estate subsidiary to the
public figures, who profited handsomely by selling after the
subsidiary's shares went on public sale in late 1986 and the price
skyrocketed.
   In recent years the device of such sales became a way for
companies to give money to politicians in excess of legal limits.
Another way was to buy tickets to politicians' fund-raising
parties, and Recruit was a major donor to Takeshita's affairs.
   With all the revelations, Takeshita was forced back to a posture
of political reform, and he said repeatedly he knew that politics
had to change and he would lead the Liberal Democrats through the
painful process.
   In the end, it wasn't enough, and he was forced to step aside so
that the party could head into this summer's elections for half the
upper house of Parliament and general elections next year with a
leadership untainted by Recruit money.
   Takeshita was born Feb. 26, 1924, as the eldest son of an old
sake brewing family in Shimane prefecture in western Japan. After
service as a pilot trainee toward the end of World War II, he
finished his university studies and taught English and social
studies for several years before turning to politics.
   He was elected to the Shimane prefectural assembly at age 27,
and then won a seat in the powerful lower house of Parliament in
1958 when he was 34.
   His political skills advanced him in a succession of key offices
including chief Cabinet secretary and construction minister. He
became finance minister in 1979 under Prime Minister Masayoshi
Ohira, continuing to hold that high post under Nakasone's
administration.

<HEAD>Service Allows Witch To Observe Religious Holidays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Air Force physical therapist who says she
is a witch has been given permission to observe eight holidays in
her faith, including All Hallow's Eve.
   Airman Patricia Hutchins, 21, who says she has been a wiccan, or
witch, for four years, asked the Air Force to allow her to take
time off from Lackland Air Force Base for religious holidays, just
as it does members of other religions.
   Witches generally believe that the sun, moon, earth and all life
are divine and are personifications of all creative energy.
   Base spokesman Bob MacNaughton said Lackland's chaplain, Col.
David Engler, wrote a letter to Ms. Hutchins' supervising officers
at Wilford Hall Medical Center, asking that they follow Air Force
regulations on religious freedom.
   MacNaughton said an Air Force regulation on accommodating
religious practices states: ``Members of the Air Force are free to
express religious beliefs in a manner that is consistent and fair
to all.''
   Ms. Hutchins said she was surprised by the chaplain's expedient
help.
   ``I have found that chaplains in the Air Force are very
open-minded,'' said Ms. Hutchins. ``I was surprised they did it,
but I'm very grateful.''
   Ms. Hutchins also will be allowed to observe days marking the
changes of the seasons.
   ``As far as we're concerned, wicca is not a hostile type of
faith,'' said MacNaughton. ``Her being a witch has not presented
any problems for her in her working place or anywhere else.''
   Among the days she'll be allowed to observe are All Hallows Eve,
Oct. 31, and days marking the changes of the seasons. Hutchins
traces her faith to Celtic Ireland.
   Ms. Hutchins' husband, who also serves in the Air Force, is not
a wiccan.
   Colleagues and co-workers haven't shunned her for her beliefs,
she said.
   ``Everybody has been really good about it,'' said Ms. Hutchins.
``I work with a lot of officers and they seem to be very
open-minded and have at least read about wiccans.''
   The daughter of a Protestant minister, Ms. Hutchins said she
doesn't know of any others in the Air Force who practice witchcraft.

   A court convicted a confessed North
Korean agent Tuesday and sentenced her to hang for the 1987 bombing
of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people on board.
   However, government officials have said privately they expect a
pardon to be granted later.
   The agent, Kim Hyon Hui, burst into tears when the Seoul
District Court found her guilty of violating national security and
aviation laws and sentenced her to death by hanging.
   Relatives of the plane victims sat quietly in court as they
heard the verdict.
   The court ruled Kim was guilty of planting a bomb aboard a
Korean Air Boeing 707 that disappeared Nov. 29, 1987, on a flight
from Baghdad, Iraq, to Seoul. It was lost over the Andaman Sea as
it approached the Burmese coast.
   Kim, a 27-year-old North Korean, had confessed to planting a
bomb on the plane and said she wanted to die to atone for the
deaths of the victims.
   Her legal counsel said after the verdict that no decision was
made on whether to appeal.
   South Korean government officials have said they did not expect
a death sentence for Kim would be carried out, despite her
confession of plotting to bomb the plane as part of a North Korean
plan to disrupt last summer's Olympic Games in Seoul.
   Officials said Kim was expected to be pardoned on grounds she
was duped by communist North Korea and has repented.
   North Korea has denied involvement in the airplane attack. It
says South Korea engineered the bombing to embarrass the communist
North.

<TEXT>
   A woman climbed to the top of the right field
foul pole at empty Shea Stadium on Monday and jumped 120 feet to
her death on the playing field, police said.
   Police said the woman, clad only in a plain flannel shirt,
climbed over a fence to get into the stadium, then used some cables
near the orange pole to get to the top, according to two
groundskeepers who saw the incident.
   She dived from the pole shortly after 9 a.m., said police
spokeswoman Officer Janice Swinney.
   The rest of the woman's clothing was found outside the stadium,
near the ticket sales booth, police said. No identification was
found, and the woman left no note.
   The woman, estimated to be between 30 and 40 years old, was
pronounced dead at the scene.
   ``This is just a tragedy,'' said Jay Horwitz, spokesman for the
New York Mets, who play at the stadium in Queens. ``We're sorry
someone was that distraught they would do this.''
   He said the woman landed ``in the right corner of right field,''
in what would be foul territory during a game.
   A foul pole is used by umpires to judge whether a batted ball in
the air is fair or foul.
   Monday's incident was not the first suicide at the 25-year-old
stadium. ``In the early 1980s someone jumped from a ramp near Gate
C and landed outside the stadium,'' Horwitz said.
   The spokesman said there were no plans to change security in
light of the incident. ``We have security here 24 hours a day, what
can you do if someone wants to do this? Unfortunately, they're
going to find a way.''
   The Mets, who had no game Monday, are scheduled to play the
Atlanta Braves at Shea on Tuesday night.

<HEAD>Striking Teachers March For Union Democracy, More Pay</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with higher crowd estimate, details
on forced resignation of union chief. CORRECTS name from Elva to Elba.
No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 150,000 striking teachers and
supporters crowded the city's main plaza Monday, shouting slogans,
carrying banners demanding pay raises and union democracy and
celebrating the resignation of their union boss.
   The departure of Carlos Jonguitud Barrios, who ran the union for
17 years, was a major demand of the dissident teachers. However,
their leader, Teodoro Palomino, said the walkout will continue
until all demands were met, including a 100 percent raise.
   He said the turnout at the march, ``despite threats of
dismissals, shows the determination of the teachers to keep
fighting.''
   The National Education Workers' Coordinate claims the support of
500,000 of the 1.1 million members of the National Education
Workers' Union, the largest and one of the strongest in Mexico and
all Latin America.
   Among the thousands of banners that teachers carried were ones
reading, ``Respectable Salary Increase and Democracy,'' ``100
Percent Salary Increase.'' Several key members of Jonguitud's
faction, including union Secretary-General Jose Refugio Araujo,
stepped down after Jonguitud resigned Sunday after a meeting with
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   Salinas ousted the oil workers' union boss in January.
Government sources said on condition of anonymity that Salinas
planned for months to squeeze out Jonguitud, but waited for the
proper moment. They said Jonguitud's resignation was a first step
toward cleaning up the union.
   ``The union has developed a certain life style over the last 17
years that won't be easy to change,'' the sources said.
   Jonguitud was probably the most important union boss remaining
from a clique that held labor in line and turned out the vote for
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party in exchange for
political office and the power that goes with control of the
coffers of large labor organizations.
   Jonguitud retains his post as a federal senator.
   The union's national council on Monday chose Elba Esther
Gordillo Morales as new secretary-general.
   Many dissidents complained she is aligned with the old guard
loyal to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, but Palomino said
she ``signifies a change, the possibility of deepening democracy
within the union.''
   The dissidents demand free union elections as well as a raise.
They rejected government offers of a 10 percent salary increase and
an 18 percent benefits raise.
   ``Ten percent, ha, ha, ha!,'' marchers shouted, some of them
shielding themselves from the hot sun with umbrellas.
   Teachers take home an average of $142 a month.
   It is common for teachers to hold two jobs to make ends meet,
working in public schools during one session, in a private school
during the other. Many drive taxis.
   Talks between the union factions will resume following a weekend
recess, Palomino said.
   ``The departure of Jonguitud is a triumph of the dissident
movement, but not the solution to the conflict, which will only be
overcome when the salary and union demands are met
satisfactorily,'' the coordinate's negotiating commission said.
   The strikers ignored a warning from the Education Department
that sanctions would be taken against those not in the classroom on
Monday.
   Salinas has cracked down on union bosses, ordering oil workers'
boss Joaquin Hernandez Galicia to jail in January on weapons
charges and orchestrating the removal of musician's union leader
Venus Rey.
   Unlike Hernandez Galicia, who was open in his dislike for
Salinas, Jonguitud cooperated with the administration, following
party tradition, and had been considered safe from the union
cleanup campaign.

   President Bush promised Monday to ``go the extra
mile'' to seek the release of U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.
   Bush, speaking before the annual luncheon of The Associated
Press, introduced the topic by saying he wanted to ``say a word
about Terry Anderson,'' chief Middle East correspondent of the AP,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   ``I just want to say without being able to give you any good
news that we are concerned; we will follow every intelligence lead;
we will go the extra mile to do what we can,'' he said.
   ``We will continue to keep this question of the hostages on the
front burner,'' the president said.
   Anderson, the longest held hostage, is among nine Americans the
State Department says are held in Lebanon. The others are Thomas
Sutherland, Frank Reed, Joseph James Cicippio, Edward Austin Tracy,
Jesse Turner, Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and William Higgins.
   Anderson, 41, has been seen or heard from only in pictures and
videotapes released by his captors and in news from freed hostages.
   At a ceremony in Washington last month marking the fourth year
since his kidnapping, the State Department issued a statement
saying: ``The hostage holders should release their captives
immediately and unconditionally, and we call on all countries with
influence over the hostages, such as Iran, to use that influence to
obtain freedom for all the hostages.''
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who has led private efforts on his
behalf, said in March he was ``frustrated, tired and lonely ... and
tired of being caged like an animal.''
   Officials say the hostages are held by various factions but that
all are elements of the umbrella group Hezbollah over which Iran
exhibits control.
   Reacting to Bush's statement Monday, Ms. Say said, ``it's a
difficult place to be, to hear that we have no good news after more
than four years. It's a little disheartening. At the same time, I
can only hope that the hostages will be a major priority of this
administration.''
   ``I think one of the hardest tings for the families to accept is
that there doesn't seem to be any sense of urgency,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ranking Ethics Committee Members Begin Local Inquiry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ranking members of the House ethics
committee began taking depositions Monday from businessmen who may
have been involved in a lucrative oil well investment for House
Speaker Jim Wright.
   The ethics panel has already accused Wright of 69 violations of
House ethics rules in his dealings with Fort Worth developer George
Mallick and in allegedly evading limits on outside income through
bulk sales of a book he wrote.
   The committee continues to investigate how a Wright-Mallick
partnership in 1988 bought a 4 percent interest in an oil and gas
well for $99,000 _ putting up only $9,120 in cash _ and sold it the
same day for $440,000.
   The chairman of the House panel, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif.,
and its leading Republican member, Rep. John Myers of Indiana,
arrived at mid-afternoon and immediately went to a hotel room to
interview the operator of the southeast Texas oil well, L.R.
Brammer Jr. of Brammer Engineering Co.
   Brammer's attorney, Ray Barlow, also was present.
   ``We didn't have time at the time to make this investigation
because we wanted to go ahead and make our report, but we had every
intention of coming back and finishing this. That is why we are
here today,'' Myers said before entering the meeting.
   ``We are going to make a thorough examination. We don't want to
miss anything. We're not here particularly to make a certain
decision. We are here for fact-finding,'' he said.
   Myers said he did not know who they would interview or if other
field hearings would be required.
   The two committee members and panel investigators are expected
to interview San Antonio financier Morris Jaffe; his business
associate and son, M.D. (Doug) Jaffe Jr.; and others involved in
the oil well deal.
   Rep. Dixon had no comment upon his arrival in San Antonio.
   Wright denies any wrongdoing and pledges to fight the
allegations. Of the 1988 oil well transaction, Wright has said, ``I
put all of my financial holdings in a blind trust in 1987, the
first year of my speakership. Under the terms of that blind trust,
I am not to be told of any of the transactions that take place.''
   Richard Phelan, the ethics committee's counsel, said the
committee needed to determine whether Wright had knowledge of the
deal, which involved the Jaffes, a West German-owned firm, and the
blind trust established for Wright in 1987.

   Two Soviets defected while government officials were
signing a protocol aimed at easing travel restrictions between
Alaska and Siberia, the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service
said Monday.
   The INS issued a brief news release that said the Soviets
approached an Alaska National Guard Eskimo Scout and asked for
political asylum just hours before the signing ceremony on Sunday.
   The scout notified his commander, who contacted the INS in Nome,
said INS spokesman Gary Johnson. The INS gave the Soviets
permission to stay on Little Diomede Island, and they spent the
night in the National Guard Armory there.
   Johnson said the Soviets would be flown to Nome, and on to
Anchorage when weather permitted.
   There was no word on whether the rest of the Soviet delegation
raised any objections to what took place. Nor was it clear whether
the delegation had returned home. Telephone service to the remote
island in the Bering Strait was disrupted by bad weather Monday.
   The Soviets were on Little Diomede for a ceremony involving
Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper and his counterpart from the Magadan
region of Siberia. The protocol they signed urged the U.S. and
Soviet governments to approve a border commission to handle visits
by Eskimos between Alaska and Siberia.
   The Eskimos would not need visas to make the trip, under the
terms of the protocol.
   The fog and blowing snow had prevented Cowper from reaching
Little Diomede on Sunday, and the signing ceremony was conducted by
telephone.
   The ceremony was held in conjunction with the Bering Bridge
Expedition, a skiing and sled dog journey from Siberia to Alaska.
The expedition consists of six Soviets and six Americans. Two of
the Soviets and two of the Americans are Eskimos.
   A number of Eskimo families were separated when the Soviets
closed the border in the Bering Strait at the onset of the Cold War
in the late 1940s.
   There was no word whether the defectors were Eskimos.
   The Soviet island of Big Diomede three miles across the strait
from Little Diomede is a military installation. The Eskimos who
once lived there were relocated to the Siberian mainland in the
1950s.

   District of Columbia Police Chief Maurice T.
Turner has submitted his retirement papers and will step down July
31, according to The Washington Post.
   Turner, who could not be reached for comment, had been
increasingly at odds with Mayor Marion S. Barry over the past few
months, the newspaper reported in its Tuesday editions.
   Turner has been with the Washington police department for the
past 32 years, and Barry said that he will begin a search for a new
police chief immediately.
   Asst. Chief Isaac Fulwood, the department's second-ranking
official, will be named to succeed Turner, the Post reported.
   In a statement issued by his office Monday night, Barry praised
Turner saying, ``Chief Turner has had an illustrious and
distinguished career in law enforcement. He is respected both
locally and nationally for his leadership of the finest police
department in the country.''
   Turner is said to be in line for a consultant's position with
the office of national drug policy director William J. Bennett, the
Post said.

   Lane Kirkland sees the ``sanctification of
greed'' he attributes to the Reagan years beginning to crumble,
bringing favorable winds to the sails of the movement he often
refers to as a ship.
   ``I think there is perhaps the beginning of some change in
climate,'' the AFL-CIO president said in an interview last week.
``We've been beating against some fairly strong winds, but I think
the ship is sound and seaworthy. And winds change.''
   His is a view cautiously shared by other labor leaders, who in
recent weeks have found themselves awash with good news, a rare
tiding in a decade the American labor movement would prefer to
forget.
   Few labor leaders expect a sudden turnaround of the decline of
the 1980s, during which membership in unions has dropped by 3
million to 17 million and the percentage of workers who are union
members dropped from 23 percent in 1980 to 16.8 percent last year.
   But many believe the passing of the Reagan administration and
labor's recent high profile may help unions halt their slide and
improve their public standing.
   ``I think the American people are listening to what we are
saying and, yes, I think things are progressing,'' United Auto
Workers President Owen Bieber said.

   More than a century after frontier wars
ceased on the plains and valleys of Montana, Indians are embroiled
in a new battle for independence against the federal government.
   On the Rocky Boys Indian Reservation in north-central Montana, a
tribal prosecutor has filed criminal charges against the chief
agent of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, accusing him of interfering
in tribal affairs by threatening not to recognize an elected tribal
government.
   The case has implications nationwide for Indian tribes' power to
control their own governments and reservations.
   ``My whole idea in this thing was, `How much authority does this
guy have?''' said Chippewa-Cree Tribal Prosecutor Jim Morsette.
``This is a problem not only in Rocky Boy, but on all the

   Twenty people, including four infants, have become ill with

   Doctors are swamped, firefighters worried about giving

   Jordan has in recent years escaped most of the Middle East's

a shock.

<HEAD>The Data Dilemma And Its New Disease: Information Anxiety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDIE GLAVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If barometric pressure has you baffled, if the
Dow Jones average has you dizzy, if you're likely to lie about
having read that 550-page report still sitting on your desk, you've
got it bad, pal _ INFORMATION ANXIETY.
   Though it sounds like a Mel Brooks satire, author Richard Saul
Wurman believes thousands, perhaps millions, suffer from the
condition.
   ``It's saying, `I just can't keep up.' It's that feeling of
pressure,'' said Wurman. ``You know it, I know it. Admit it,
everyone does,'' says the fast-talking author of ``Information
Anxiety'' (Doubleday, $19.95).
   ``It's that feeling that Jerry Smith down the street can put
together the bicycle and you don't know how; that THEY can program
their VCR to record things 14 days ahead of time and you can't ...
that he's read the big, fat report sitting in your box and you
can't because it just doesn't make any sense, so you have to lie
and say, `Oh yeah, that was a pretty good report.'''
   That, says Wurman, is what society's latest high-tech malady has
done _ turned humans into masses of lying, quivering jelly brains,
too afraid to admit they don't know, or don't understand.
   Wurman argues that information anxiety is a result of the
societal demand that everyone become a well-rounded cultural being,
coupled with the fact that much of the information being dispersed
does not really inform.
   ``It's just stuff, or data, and I refer to it as the
non-information explosion.''
   Wurman blames the education system. He says schools teach that
``it's better to say, `I know' than `I don't know.' It's better to
answer a question than ask a question. ... A longer report is a
better report.''
   His new book is aimed at calming anxiety sufferers by providing
such down-to-earth, common-sense ideas as:
   _ Allow that pile of periodicals stack up so high before ripping
out individual articles of interest, thereby, reducing a
preponderant pile to small stacks of what Wurman calls ``interest
shards.'' The idea: less to look at, less anxiety.
   _ Make a list of terms you use or hear often, but don't really
understand (barometric pressure, the Dow Jones industrial average)
and make a point to learn what they mean, one at a time.
   _ Never nod your head at something you don't understand.
Practice saying, ``I don't understand,'' in front of a mirror. The
sooner you admit you don't know, the sooner you can actually learn.
   The book, admits Wurman, is full of a lot of things that people
always knew, but having them written in a book ``gives it the kind
of justification to say it out loud for the first time.''
   Wurman, who has an office in San Francisco and a loft-office in
Manhattan, is an architect by training but is better known as an
architect of information.
   ``I realize how ignorant I am,'' he said. ``I'm more
knowledgeable about my ignorance than perhaps anybody I know.''
   ``When I don't understand things, I often do a book about
them,'' says the 53-year-old writer, who has turned his thirst for
knowledge into a thriving business.
   The result has been 26 ``Access'' books that include guides to
the 1984 Olympics, medical terms and his latest, a guide to The
Wall Street Journal, which walks readers through a jungle of
financial jargon.
   He also is responsible for revamping the Pacific Bell Yellow
Pages, listing goods and services other than alphabetically _ by
neighborhood and category, for example.
   Though pessimistic about ending information anxiety, Wurman
believes that within a decade the nation's data dilemma will spawn
a new, multi-billion dollar industry: the understanding business.
   ``Newspapers will begin hiring people not just to style their
newspapers but to make them understandable,'' he said. ``Some bold
news program on television will do that, and we'll actually have a
weather map that you can understand.
   ``And business reports won't talk about M1s, M2s and M3s, which
everybody thinks are bus lines. It will be information that people
can use.''
   Because he understands this, he's gotten a jump on the
competition and created a new business venture, The Understanding
Business.
   Now that's using common sense, which is what Wurman says his
books, his business and his life is all about.
   ``I already told you,'' he says smiling, ``I'm not that smart.''

<HEAD>New Canadian Embassy in Washington Designed to Carry a Message</HEAD>

   Canada has built a new embassy in Washington and
the architect says it is designed to carry a message.
   ``Our mandate from External Affairs was that the building was to
demonstrate good neighborliness and openness, friendliness,''
architect Arthur Erickson said in an interview. ``We really took
them as the basic theme for the building.''
   Canada is the only nation to have an embassy on Pennsylvania
Avenue, the thoroughfare between the U.S. Capitol and the White
House. Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will attend the inauguration
May 3.
   As for the location, Erickson said: ``I think in light of the
new trade agreement and everything else, it's becoming even more
significant.''
   A free-trade agreement with the United States went into effect
Jan. 1.
   The Canadian maple leaf flag already is flying over the embassy
across the street from the new East Building of the National
Gallery of Art.
   The architect is a native of British Columbia who maintains
offices there, in Los Angeles and in Toronto. He is the only
Canadian who has received the gold medal of the American Institute
of Architects.
   The Washington site was acquired more than a decade ago during
an early stage of Pennsylvania Avenue's revival.
   Erickson said he intended the embassy to get across the idea of
welcoming as well. He added that he wanted to demonstrate not only
Canada's unique qualities but also its close relationship with the
United States.
   ``You acknowledge the similarities of cultural background and
that sort of the thing but at the same time indicate the
differences,'' he said.
   The architect said the enormous span that is the most visible
feature of the building was intended to bring to mind the vastness
of spaces in Canada, the world's second-largest country.
   ``It's a very generous span, and that to me represented the
sweep and generosity of, I hate to say the Canadian landscape, but
I guess that's really what I mean,'' he said.
   The 12 pillars on the embassy's rotunda represent Canada's 10
provinces and two territories. A final touch for the entrance, due
to be ready in about a year, will be an 18-foot by 12-foot ``spirit
canoe'' sculpture by artist Bill Reid of the Haida people native to
British Columbia's Queen Charlotte Islands.
   Not all comment on the highly visible embassy has been positive.
   The Canadian news weekly Maclean's, in a report from Washington
critical enough to prompt Erickson to write a letter to the editor,
said the building was ``drawing praise and raising eyebrows,
objections and arguments.''
   Erickson, who was born in Vancouver in 1924, said he wrote his
response because he considered the article an example of ``typical
Canadian sour grapes about anything a Canadian accomplishes.''
   Derek Burney, Canada's new ambassador to the United States, told
Maclean's the new embassy is ``a strong and confident building for
a strong and confident Canada. ... It conveys the message that I
want to convey: Canada counts.''

<TEXT>
   From its rundown headquarters in a Lusaka
alleyway, the African National Congress maintains a powerful hold
on South Africa's blacks despite its failure to gain political
power after 77 years of trying.
   Founded in 1912, the ANC has the reputation of being the world's
oldest liberation movement. But it says it is stronger and more
effective than ever, although its imprisoned leader, Nelson
Mandela, recently acknowledged that ``the realization of our
fondest dreams may not be at hand.''
   ANC officials live modestly but in relative comfort in Lusaka,
and work in a weatherbeaten one-story building in the alley just
off the main downtown throughfare.
   No special security is evident at the headquarters, no sign of
guns or military uniforms. The cramped offices, with cluttered
desks and bulging file cabinets, resemble the offices of auto
repair shops that share the same neighborhood.
   The atmosphere is relaxed and the dress casual and the officials
who sometimes wear jackets and ties look slightly out of place.
   Tom Sebina, the spokesman, said no more than 1,000 ANC members
are based in Lusaka. The organization refuses to divulge its
membership, but it is estimated at 14,000, including about 8,000 in
its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, which means spear of the
nation.
   The ANC managed a steady stream of political successes
throughout the 1980s, but it currently faces several major
challenges that have left it in a somewhat defensive position.
   The international pressure on the South African government has
eased since it signed a peace treaty with Angola and Cuba and
agreed to grant independence to Namibia. As part of the treaty,
Angola agreed to shut down ANC training camps, leaving the
guerrillas with no acknowledged military bases in southern Africa.
   The Soviet Union, which is the ANC's main arms supplier, has
said that black revolution appears unlikely now and that a
negotiated settlement should be sought.
   ``The South Africans have scored diplomatic victories, but these
will be only temporary advances,'' said James Stuart, a member of
the ANC's National Executive Committee, its policy-making arm.
``There have been no fundamental changes to apartheid, and this is
the issue they cannot evade.''
   ANC President Oliver Tambo visited Moscow earlier this year, and
the organization has denied widespread reports that it is under
pressure to call off its guerrilla attacks.
   ``The Soviets accept the direction we have chosen and there is
no change in their level of support,'' said Sindiso Mfenyane,
another member of the National Executive Committee.
   But in many eyes, the ANC has lost the initiative in its
struggle against South Africa's white-led government.
   After 28 years of limited guerrilla warfare, the ANC still vows
to intensify its armed struggle. But the military threat is limited.
   ``The main benefit to the ANC of the armed struggle is that
exploding bombs and shootouts with the security forces keep its
profile high in the black townships,'' said the South African
political analyst Stanley Uys. But he maintains that the impact on
white civilians is marginal since they are seldom targets or
victims.
   South African police say the number of ANC attacks has risen
steadily and topped 200 last year, but its bombing and sabotage
campaign has been largely inactive of late.
   ANC leaders deny the organization is in retreat, but many have
spent more than a quarter-century in exile and hold out little hope
of making an imminent return to South Africa as triumphant
revolutionary heros.
   ``We know that change won't come overnight in South Africa and
that some of us may not be around when it happens,'' said Mfenyane,
who has spent 27 of his 49 years in exile. ``But we know that the
change will come.''
   The ANC's endurance, more so than its limited successes, is one
of the main reasons it still has the loyalty of many of South
Africa's 28 million blacks.
   The organization bridges both generational gaps and tribal
differences. Elderly black men will speak of the reserved dignity
of Tambo, a lawyer, while militant youths are drawn to the
organization's commitment to violent revolution.
   Almost all leading anti-apartheid groups in South Africa vow
allegiance to the organization and it is widely believed the ANC
would win national elections if blacks were allowed to vote.
   But the ANC's support is far from universal. Recent polls,
including one this year by The Independent newspaper of London,
indicate that there is no black consensus on the ANC's violence or
its campaign for comprehensive sanctions against South Africa.
   The ANC also has had differences with allied anti-apartheid
organizations in South Africa.
   The internal anti-apartheid movement harshly denounced Mandela's
wife, Winnie, earlier this year and accused her controversial
bodyguards of terrorizing other blacks. But the ANC, at a March
meeting in Norway, said, ``Winnie should be given the opportunity
to continue to be the symbol of our struggle.''
   The ANC, based abroad since it was banned in 1960, bristles at
talk that it has lost touch with black South Africans after so many
years in exile.
   ``There is more contact now than ever before because of the
continuous flow of traffic from South Africa,'' said Sebina. ``We
couldn't have survived this long if the people didn't support us.''

<TEXT>
   The anatomy lab at Khartoum University's
medical school was washed away by flood and no money is available
to build a new one.
   The library in the college of engineering can't afford to buy
more than one professional journal for each of its 2,250 students.
   Sudan's ailing economy is taking a toll on Khartoum University
and seven other government-run universities.
   But even more serious is the toll it is taking on students after
graduation _ they can't find jobs.
   Educators say all of that adds up to a threatening situation in
a country that not only has serious economic problems but also is
bogged down in civil war in the south.
   The cycle for the crisis in education begins early. Every year
45,000 high school students graduate with grades high enough to
enter university, but room can be found for only 5,000.
   At the same time, the universities annually graduate around
7,000 students into a job market in which 33,000 university
graduates in Khartoum alone are unemployed.
   ``We demanded 300 million pounds ($25 million) for the
university this year, but the government only gave us 128 million
pounds ($10.6 million),'' said Abdel-Baset Mohamed Ali of Khartoum
University's planning and development division.
   ``We inherited these universities from colonial times. The
buildings are old and need refurbishing,'' he added in an interview.
   ``And we need to review our degree structures according to the
needs of labor. But that kind of change means innovation, and that
means expense that we cannot afford. So the degree structure has
not changed to be able to cope with the new demands of the labor
market.''
   The lack of money has caused a multiplicity of related problems.
   Mohamed Omar Beshir, a professor at Khartoum University's
Institute for African and Asian Studies, said nearly half the
university's 1,200 professors had left for better-paying jobs in
the Persian Gulf states.
   A beginning university professor at Khartoum University gets the
equivalent of about $165 a month, much more than government
bureaucrats but less than what a teacher earns in a private
secondary school.
   A senior university lecturer can make double the starting
salary, but in Saudi Arabia or other gulf countries he can earn 20
times as much and live a much more comfortable life.
   Facility and resource renewal and updating are other problems
exacerbated by the university system's money woes.
   Abdel-Rahman AbuZayd, former dean of Juba University in southern
Sudan and now head of Omdurman National College, said library
reference books 30 years old are common and some are even as old as
50 years.
   ``The books are no longer up to date,'' he said, ``but books are
expensive all over the world, and we have almost no foreign
exchange.''
   Instruments and equipment are in severely short supply in
institutions specializing in the practical sciences.
   At Khartoum University's medical school, torrential rains in
August triggered floods that ruined the anatomy laboratory. The
university has appealed to the international community,
specifically the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), for money to build a new laboratory
but so far without success.
   Such shortcomings have limited the numbers of students who can
be accommodated in disciplines like medicine and engineering, which
means that potential students usually find themselves studying
arts, whether they like it or not. On graduation, they find no
market for what they've learned, except possibly as poorly paid
teachers turning out more unneeded arts graduates.
   Some pioneers are trying to make that change.
   AbuZayd said he is introducing at Omdurman National courses that
teach technical skills.
   ``We're producing people who will find jobs,'' he said. ``We
train them to be assistants in medical laboratories, computer
studies, executive secretaries, dental technicians, in
environmental studies. ...
   ``For example, instead of offering a five-year engineering
degree where we only teach engineering, we also offer a three-year
program in which the student learns engineering and decorating and
studies on electric appliances. These engineering assistants find
much more work than engineers.''
   Such innovations are possible for AbuZayd because his university
is private and tuitions are the Sudanese-pound equivalnt to $416 to
$500 a year.
   Education is free in the government-run universities.

   Producer-creator Steven Bochco's first series
for ABC under his new multi-series contract is a medical show. But,
wait, the Bochco twist is in there.
   The half-hour comedy's called ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' and
centers on the life of a young intern. Did we say young? Doogie's
voice probably hasn't changed yet. He's 15 years old.
   Bochco, co-creator of ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``Hooperman,''
generally puts an unusual spin on his stories that makes them
different.
   Doogie's graduated from medical school. He doesn't have to worry
about house calls, since he hasn't learned to drive yet.
Intellectually, he's a genius. Emotionally, he's still a kid.
   ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' has a series commitment, but dozens of
other comedies and dramas are being considered by the three
networks for the fall season. The new schedules will be announced
in mid-May.
   The networks are lining up plenty of stars for the fall. Besides
that, NBC has Alan Alda committed to a one-hour drama for
mid-season next year.
   NBC's lineup of series possibilities includes: Tim Matheson as
an American bachelor who falls in love with a beautiful Russian
woman (Irena Ferris) in ``Nikki &amp; Alexander''; Harvey Korman and
Cloris Leachman as hotel keepers in ``The Nutt House''; Ann Jillian
as a widowed mother seeking a new life in California in ``The Ann
Jillian Show''; Robert Mitchum as a homeless man who becomes
grandfather to four foster kids in ``One Man's Family.''
   CBS's star schedule: Gregory Harrison as a fashion photographer
who gets custody of his two sons in ``The Gregory Harrison Show'';
Dweezil and Moon Zappa as brother and sister in an unusual family
in ``Norman Life''; James Farentino and Lindsay Crouse in a drama
about a newspaper columnist and his politico wife in ``American
Nuclear''; Lindsay Wagner as the manager of a zoo in ``A Peaceable
Kingdom''; Tim Reid and Daphne Reid as a stylish Washington couple
who keep getting mixed up in solving crimes in ``Snoops''; Lee
Majors as a man of the road who teams up with a columnist (Ellen
Greene) in ``Travellin'.''
   ABC's stars include: Jackie Mason as a man forced into early
retirement who works with inner city youths in an untitled series
commitment; Howie Mandel as a man who keeps flashing back to
different periods in his life in ``Past Imperfect.''
   As in previous years, the three networks are looking at more
comedy pilots than dramatic shows.
   Show business themes figure in a number of pilots. For instance:
Jack Warden and Mason Adams star as feuding radio partners who team
up again in NBC's ``Knight and Daye.'' Robert Hays works for a
public radio station in NBC's ``FM.'' Jon Cryer is a kid in the
mail room who suddenly becomes a super talent agent in CBS' ``The
Famous Teddy Z.'' Ricki Lake is an aspiring actress in CBS'
``Starting Now.'' A group of friends in Kansas are making a horror
film in CBS' ``Curse of the Corn People.'' ABC's ``Morning Glory''
is about a morning TV show. ABC's ``Elvis: Good Rockin' Tonight''
is about the King himself.
   Did you ask about cops? There are enough potential cop shows to
satisfy every appetite.
   Young cops abound in ABC's ``Protect &amp; Surf.'' David Dukes heads
a bunch of cops who work in an old bakery in CBS' ``The Bakery.''
And you thought only bank robbers went where the dough was. Shadoe
Stevens is a wild and crazy cop in CBS' ``Loose Cannon.'' CBS'
``Nick Knight'' is a homicide detective who works at night _ he's a
vampire.
   Robert Loggia, who starred in the NBC miniseries ``Favorite
Son,'' reprises his character for ``Mancuso, FBI.''
   Westerns and outer space are back. George Clooney stars in CBS'
``Hot Prospects,'' a comedy about a train depot restaurant owner
who imports waitresses from the East and puts them up in a brothel.
CBS' ``Mars: Base One'' is about an average family _ on Mars. CBS'
``Outpost'' combines both. It's about a Western-style marshal on a
distant planet. ABC's ``The Kid'' tells of the young orphans who
rode for the Pony Express.
   NBC also has a bawdy comedy called ``1761'' that smacks of the
wit and sexiness of ``Dangerous Liaisons.'' It's set among the
lords and ladies of London, who are visited by an adventurous
American cousin in the decade before the unpleasantness in the
colonies.

   Elsewhere in television:
   ROAD RAIDERS ... Bruce Boxleitner stars as the head of a bunch
of oddballs and World War II military misfits in the Philippines in
the CBS movie ``The Road Raiders.'' Although it's not listed among
the CBS pilots, Boxleitner has said he considers it a series
possibility. If it gets a good rating, CBS will also consider it a
series possibility.

<HEAD>GOP Holding Its Fire on Wright _ For Now</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians have an uncanny knack for stepping
on their own lines and for speaking when silence would serve them
best. It's a gold mine for consultants, who charge big fees for
telling their candidates to be quiet.
   Republicans, at least most of them, figured it out for
themselves when House Speaker Jim Wright was hauled up on ethics
charges. With the nation's top Democratic office holder facing 69
charges of violating House rules, no comment could improve upon the
issue for the GOP.
   Wright's Democratic defenders argue the whole case is a matter
of partisan politics, even though the charges came from an ethics
committee evenly divided between the parties, six members apiece.
Since that is a central message of the defense, Republicans
attempts to capitalize on the Wright case right now would be
counterproductive.
   So the GOP theme has been judicious righteousness, leaving the
Democrats to stew over their own problems. The minority leader,
Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois, counseled his colleagues to exercise
``extraordinary restraint and patience until final action is
taken.''
   President Bush has been careful to avoid the Wright case. ``The
last thing I want to do is involve myself in any way,'' he has said.
   One school of political thought has it that Republicans will use
the Wright ethics case to retaliate against Democrats for Senate
rejection of the Bush's nomination of John G. Tower to be secretary
of defense. Bush doesn't like that thought: ``I simply wouldn't
condone that at all, and I would condemn it.''
   Even Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the new Republican whip,
kept his profile and voice uncharacteristically low for a while,
avoiding public comment when the Ethics Committee charges were
announced.
   That couldn't last, and didn't. Gingrich, who lodged the
accusations that led to the Wright investigation, spoke up last
week, repeating that he believes the speaker will be out by summer.
   ``I don't see how the guy survives,'' Gingrich said at luncheon
with reporters. He said he doubted the charges ever would reach the
House floor, suggesting that Democratic leaders would press Wright
to resign as speaker in return for some lesser punishment.
   Gingrich then insisted Republicans are carefully avoiding any
intrusion on the ethics committee process.
   ``We have been saying this ought to be done in a careful and
judicious way, and Jack Brooks and Charlie Wilson have been running
around publicly threatening members of the ethics committee,'' he
said.
   Brooks and Wilson are Texas Democrats and leaders in the Wright
defense.
   Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, an activist conservative of the
Gingrich school, claimed the Democrats have made ``a nonpartisan
issue into a political firestorm.''
   In commentary he wrote for The New York Times, Weber said
``while most Republicans have been waiting to judge the case on the
facts, virtually all prominent Democrats have declared the speaker
innocent _ before hearing the evidence.''
   ``We Republicans are not attacking the gentleman from Texas,''
Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana told the House. ``We are taking a
wait-and-see attitude until all the facts are out, until we all
read the report, until it is brought before the House.''
   Well, sort of. Gingrich praised the ethics committee findings as
solid and remarkably thorough, although he acknowledged he had only
skimmed the documents. He said he'd lived with the Wright case long
enough to know serious work when he sees it.
   Republicans can afford political piety on this one because they
assume that Wright is on a hook he cannot get off _ and the
Democratic majority that made him speaker will ultimately have to
figure out what to do about it.
   Gingrich suggested a way out short of an embarrassing showdown
on Wright, although he insisted he wasn't offering a deal. He said
they could cut their losses if Wright were to resign as speaker and
Majority Leader Thomas S. Foley of Washington succeeded him.
   ``There would be a very large effort on both sides of the aisle,
I think, to have a period of bipartisanship if you had Foley as
speaker, and to try to heal some of the wounds,'' Gingrich said.

<HEAD>South Africa an Outlet for Smuggled Ivory and Rhino Horns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big-time smugglers are using
South Africa as a major transit point for shipping poached ivory
and rhinoceros horns out of Africa.
   The development, which is attributed in part to South Africa's
eagerness for international trade, has infuriated local
conservationists, who say it tarnishes the nation's reputation as a
leader in wildlife preservation.
   They have urged the government to tighten customs inspections,
intensify police investigations and stiffen penalties.
   ``Until this can be achieved, South African conservationists
must hang their heads in shame,'' wrote John Ledger, director of
the Endangered Wildlife Trust, in a recent magazine editorial. ``We
have been blind to the criminals in our midst.''
   Ledger and his colleagues say South Africans and foreigners
collaborate in operating vast international smuggling rings. They
are among the paymasters of poachers who, in the past two decades,
have played the main role in cutting Africa's rhino population from
about 70,000 to 4,000 and the elephant population from 1.3 million
to about 450,000.
   The toll of elephants has prompted many countries to closely
control the trade in ivory.
   Typically, ivory and rhino horns are smuggled into South Africa
by truck from countries such as Zambia, Zaire, Angola or
Mozambique. Experts say the contraband usually is flown to the Far
East, where the biggest markets are.
   Rhino horn is sold in powdered form in the Far East and other
countries as an aphrodisiac.
   Many Far Eastern countries have increased trade with South
Africa over the past few years as Western nations imposed trade
sanctions to protest its apartheid policies.
   Esmond Bradley-Martin, a Kenyan-based expert on the illegal
trade in rhino horns, says the biggest demand for rhino products is
in Taiwan, which has close economic and political ties with South
Africa.
   Encouraged by the government, Taiwanese businessmen have
established scores of factories in South Africa in recent years,
and hundreds of Taiwanese have moved here.
   ``Thus, the perfect opportunity has been provided for Chinese
businessmen to purchase rhino horn and hide from illegal South
African dealers and take these supplies from Jan Smuts airport in
Johannesburg to Taipei,'' Bradley-Martin wrote last year.
   Ledger said customs workers at Jan Smuts lack the resources to
investigate all outgoing cargo, especially shipments that appear to
have proper permits.
   At highway border posts, he said, customs officials checking
incoming goods from neighboring states search more intensively for
weapons and explosives than for elephant tusks or rhino horns.
   Also, in a bid to encourage regional trade, South Africa has a
customs agreement with several of its neighbors and this means many
vehicles enter without thorough searches. Some containers pass
through South Africa without ever being inspected.
   ``We've developed a good network of trading because of our
political isolation,'' said Clive Walker, a prominent Johannesburg
conservationist. ``We've been used by smugglers who have found a
convenient way of doing business with a good degree of safety.''
   Ledger said the problem lies with light penalties for smugglers,
who face no more than a 2,000-rand ($800) fine if found in
possession of contraband rhino horns.
   ``It's an easy option for a crook,'' he said in an interview.
``The penalties are a fraction of what they'd be for drug
smugglers.''
   Parliament is considering legislation that would increase the
maximum penalty to a 100,000-rand ($40,000) fine or 15 years in
prison.
   In a recent documentary, the state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. said 50 tons of ivory was exported from South
Africa last year, accompanied by seemingly proper permits. However,
the broadcast said only 14 tons could be accounted for officially _
seven tons legally brought into South Africa and seven tons culled
from elephants killed in a population-control program at Kruger
National Park.
   A U.S. environmental group, the Conservation, Environmental and
Animal Welfare Consortium, alleged last year that the South African
military had helped organize an ivory smuggling racket intended to
provide funds for anti-Marxist guerrillas in Angola and Mozambique.
   A South African board of inquiry rejected charges of large-scale
military involvement, although it said the army did help Angola
rebels transport elephant tusks in 1978-79.
   Two South African army officers were among six people indicted
last year in Connecticut on charges that they smuggled rhino horns,
skins of other endangered animals and AK-47 rifles into the United
States.
   Ledger wants to declare war on all ivory and horn smugglers.
   ``While we have proudly extolled to the world the righteousness
of South Africa's conservation achievements, these evil people have
destroyed our reputation and our pride,'' he wrote in the
editorial. ``They have to be stopped.''

<TEXT>
   Today is Saturday, May 6, the 126th day of 1989. There are 239
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   One hundred years ago, on May 6, 1889, the Paris Exposition
formally opened, featuring the just-completed Eiffel Tower.
   On this date:
   In 1840, England introduced its first postage stamp.
   In 1861, Arkansas seceded from the Union.
   In 1882, Congress passed, over President Chester Alan Arthur's
veto, the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese immigrants
from the United States for 10 years. Similar acts were passed in
1892 and 1902.
   In 1910, Britain's King Edward VII died.
   In 1915, Babe Ruth hit his first major-league home run as a
player for the Boston Red Sox.
   In 1935, the Works Progress Administration began operating.
   In 1937, the hydrogen-filled German dirigible ``Hindenburg''
burst into flames and crashed while docking in Lakehurst, N.J.,
killing 36 of the 97 people on board.
   In 1942, during World War II, U.S. forces under General Jonathan
Wainwright surrendered Corregidor to the Japanese.
   In 1954, medical student Roger Bannister broke the four-minute
mile during a track meet in Oxford, England, in 3:59:04 minutes.
   In 1960, Britain's Princess Margaret married Anthony
Armstrong-Jones, a commoner, at Westminster Abbey. The marriage
ended in divorce in 1978.
   In 1962, in the first test of its kind, the submerged submarine
USS Ethan Allen fired a Polaris missile armed with a nuclear
warhead that detonated above the Pacific Ocean.
   In 1978, ``Affirmed,'' ridden by Steve Cauthen, won the 104th
Kentucky Derby, the first leg of an eventual Triple Crown victory
the year after ``Seattle Slew'' also won the Triple Crown.
   In 1980, the bodies of eight Americans killed in the aborted
mission to rescue the hostages in Iran were flown to the United
States from Tehran by way of Switzerland.
   In 1983, West German government experts announced that tests had
proven the purported Hitler diaries to be ``obvious fakes.''
   In 1987, CIA Director William J. Casey died at age 74.
   Ten years ago: Chanting, ``No more Harrisburgs,'' a reference to
the accident at Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island atomic plant, tens
of thousands of people marched in Washington against nuclear energy.
   Five years ago: Voters in El Salvador went to the polls for the
second time in six weeks, this time to decide a presidential runoff
between Jose Napoleon Duarte and Roberto d'Aubuisson. Duarte would
emerge the winner.
   One year ago: In his first comment on the matter, President
Ronald Reagan said he didn't ``look kindly upon'' reports that a
memoir written by his former chief of staff, Donald Regan, painted
an unflattering portrait of first lady Nancy Reagan.
   Today's birthdays: Actor Stewart Granger is 76. Baseball great
Willie Mays is 58. Rock singer Bob Seger is 44. Singer Janet
Jackson is 23.
   Thought for today: ``Faults are thick where love is thin.'' _
Danish proverb.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In business and economics it is sometimes
difficult to find the real world, and thereafter to figure it out.
So often is a dream world depicted that it poses as the real thing.
   In the consumer economy, for instance, personal finance
publications offer endless tips on how to pick the best mutual
fund, how to find hidden stock values, how to cut debts with ease,
and how to slash taxes.
   Those who live in the real world know there are no easy ways to
pay bills, virtually no stock tips that are worth the risk, no
newly discovered ways to lower taxes _ and certainly no way to
slash them that is acceptable to Uncle Sam.
   In the dream world, a happy family of four is depicted with
smiling faces after having negotiated a home equity loan. Now they
can afford the things they want: a car, a boat, a vacation, a life
of comfortable ease and luxury.
   In the real world, however, you begin paying interest on the
equity loan in the very next month, and you may struggle to meet
the payments. And struggling, of course, is not compatible with
ease, luxury, boating or carefree vacations.
   Business is as bad. In construction, to name just one industry,
it is a certainty that good times will produce overbuilding,
followed soon after by abandoned commercial projects, condos that
won't sell, and distressed lenders.
   The dream world has little to do with the amount of money or the
alleged acumen of the dreamers. Some of the most highly financed
manufacturers live in the world of dreams, and their big bucks do
nothing to bring them around.
   Almost every economic recession, for example, is preceded by a
buildup of inventories, a consequence of producers convincing
themselves that good times are here to stay and that they must go
all out to meet the demand.
   In fact, that tendency has been even more observable in recent
years. Produce heavily, carmakers say, because we can always
institute a program of rebates or below-market interest rates to
move the goods.
   In the real world, of course, rebates and low interest rates
amount to the same thing as a price cut, and everyone knows it.
   The securities industry fades in and out of either world. When
times are good they can only get better, and when they turn bad
they can only grow worse, according to the dreamers. But when do
booms begin? When the dreams are bust.
   Securities forecasters often decline even to recognize the real
world, preferring instead to poke their heads far out into the
future, which cannot be understood or described. Big things are
always happening out there in space.
   What happens in those dreams of the future, however, seldom
descends to the day-to-day world. As seen by the dreamers, the
future changes each week. Before it ever arrives, before it is even
created, it is different from what it was.
   One of the current oddities in the securities market is the
assertion by many that junk bonds, so-called because of the risk
involved, are as good as other bonds, and to those who live in King
Midas land, maybe as good as gold.
   And to the realists who have lived through boom and bust on Wall
Street, there is no one phrase that describes the confusion of
dream world and real world better than this: Things have changed;
the old rules don't apply anymore.
   They have heard that phrase at the beginning and just before the
end of every bull market of the century, and one of the few
certainties on Wall Street is that it will be heard into the next
century at least.

   Hey kids! You've heard Ice T's records, seen
D.J. Jazzy Jeff's videos. Now pick up your phone and talk to them!
   Well, sort of.
   They talk. You listen. And your parents pay.
   Welcome to the latest teen craze: telephone hot lines to the
stars. By dialing a number with a 900 prefix, listeners can hear a
prerecorded message from their favorite rock stars, talking about
whatever happens to enter their minds. It all costs about $2.50 for
two minutes.
   Kids are calling by the thousands. That's bringing smiles to the
faces of entrepreneurs prescient enough to tap into this holy
trinity of marketing _ teen-agers, telephones and rock 'n' roll.
   ``The market's right there,'' said Andrea West, who manages the
telephone service for American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. ``If
you're a teen-ager, you know music. And you certainly don't have an
aversion to the telephone.''
   The reigning kings of the phone lines are teen-age rap stars
D.J. Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince. Their good-natured 1988 hit,
``Parents Just Don't Understand,'' was the type of song youngsters
could understand and parents not resent.
   Their telephone line opened nearly a year ago and at its peak,
fans were calling at the rate of 50,000 per day. It's approaching
the landmark of 3 million calls, said Michael Omansky, vice
president for marketing at RCA Records.
   Other teen faves have followed suit, including Bobby Brown,
Samantha Fox, Al B. Sure!, Lita Ford and New Kids on the Block, at
varying degrees of success.
   ``It's a great way for the fans to continue to get to know the
artists that they like,'' said Donnie Wahlberg, one of the five New
Kids on the Block. ``I think it's great. You call Bobby Brown's hot
line and it's almost like he's talking right to you. In a way, he
is.''
   Few of the messages are particularly weighty. One recent day on
the Jazzy Jeff line, the two rap stars talked about which Nintendo
computer games they liked to play. They said they were embarrassed
when they tried to buy some and handed a clerk the wrong credit
card _ just the kind of daily triviality teen-agers love to tell
their friends on the phone.
   The musicians have a fresh message every day, recording them in
bunches like the producers of television game shows.
   ``We think of a subject and just wing it,'' Wahlberg said. ``We
don't sit down and write out what we're going to say. We try to
talk just like the way we talk, as if the caller was right there in
the conversation.''
   Most messages are accompanied by a commercial for some
star-related product. Youngsters can get a free autographed picture
of Ice T, provided they send in a copy of their phone bill proving
they've called his phone line.
   It's the personal touch that's made the phone lines such a smash
_ even if it is on tape.
   Cory Eisner, vice president of Phone Programs Inc., can easily
say, ``I told you so.'' He approached several record companies for
his outfit, which sets up the phone lines, and was routinely turned
down before Omansky took a chance.
   It's a wonder it took so long. For record companies, it's a
great deal. The phone lines help sell records, and the records help
sell the phone lines. Both make money.
   Record companies are reluctant to say how much. But simple
addition paints a rosy picture. The phone company takes about 65
cents for a $2 call, with the remainder split between the record
company, the artist and go-betweens such as Phone Programs.
   That's more than $4 million generated by Jazzy Jeff's phone line
alone, minus expenses for advertising and recording the messages.
   ``There is a business objective behind all of this,'' said West
of AT&amp;T. ``If you can involve the audience more, know who your
audience is, you'll be able to be better at what you do.''
   The rock hot lines are direct descendants of AT&amp;T's phone lines
that allow Americans to eavesdrop on the conversations of shuttle
astronauts.
   Rick Springfield was the first musician to tap into the
technology back in 1984, West said. But it wasn't until rap _
itself a musical style that values talking over singing _ embraced
the phones that they exploded in popularity.
   Not everyone is happy about that.
   ``A lot of families have been learning the hard way how
appealing the 900 lines are for teen-agers or even younger kids,''
said Nancy Larraine Hoffman, a New York state senator and mother of
teen-age children.
   ``Kids don't know anything about a phone bill. It could have a
pretty devastating effect on a family's budget.''
   She's proposed legislation in New York that would require phone
companies to give parents the options of putting a ``block'' on
their phone lines to prevent children from calling the 900 lines.
   More than half the states require phone companies to offer such
blocks, although they differ on whether or not this is a free
service, said Debby Bernau, spokeswoman for the National Conference
of State Legislators. The proliferation of pornographic phone lines
and party lines instigated the actions.
   Although New York state doesn't require the blocks, New York
Telephone, which services more than 90 percent of the phones in the
state, already offers the option free of charges.
   But West said parents shouldn't be too worried. The rock phone
lines are hot right now, just like hula hoops, pet rocks and
streaking were in the past.
   ``For the same reason, it will go away,'' she said.

   In Britain's past, women movers and shakers
mainly were monarchs. For the past decade, the dominant figure has
been Margaret Thatcher, the commoner, and she has put the firm
stamp of ``Thatcherism'' onto British history. A correspondent who
has covered the prime minister since she came to office here
describes the Thatcher Decade.

   Many Britons barely remember life before Margaret
Thatcher, and many more can't imagine what Britain will be like
after she's gone.
   In the decade since she came to power on May 4, 1979, something
of a curiosity as Europe's first female prime minister, she has
become, in her own words, an institution.
   Having begun with uncertain prospects for survival, she has now
had the longest uninterrupted tenure in 160 years of British
politics.
   She dominates national life more than any prime minister since
Winston Churchill in World War II. She was asked once what she had
changed.
   ``Everything,'' she replied.
   So all-embracing is the free-market crusade called
``Thatcherism'' that even the name of her Conservative Party has
become something of a misnomer.
   Conservatism, columnist Alan Watkins wrote in the liberal weekly
Observer, means preserving the old. But ``Mrs. Thatcher has not
only refused to put the clock back; she has put it forward, turning
the hands furiously, so that bells chime unpredictably and
clockwork jangles.''
   She has quelled the labor unions; she has sold off vast segments
of the state-owned sector turning traditional money-losers like
steel into profitable enterprises and in the process has built an
army of new shareholders; she has shifted the entire political
agenda rightward; she has achieved the international
recognizability of a superpower leader.
   Now, after a third consecutive election victory in 1987, she is
trying to carry the revolution into the heartland of the old
Britain by shaking up the 40-year-old National Health Service, the
tradition-cloaked legal profession and the education system.
   It has been, says Hugo Young, her latest biographer, ``an era in
which an ordinary politician, laboring under many disadvantages,
grew into an international figure who did some extraordinary things
to her country.''
   It is a formidable legacy and most analysts agree much of it
will endure.
   ``There will never again be moribund nationalized industries,''
said Robert Worcester, head of pollsters Market Opinion and
Research International, said in an interview.
   ``There will never again be trade union baronies, there will
never again be the working class rejection of middle class values
by the majority.''
   The election May 3, 1979, with the final results declared early
on May 4, followed a winter of strikes that left the dead unburied
and garbage piled in cities, and spelled the end of James
Callaghan's Labor government.
   She began with a prolonged spell of bitter medicine: high
unemployment as loss-making heavy industries were pared, state
spending curbs, then an onslaught against heavy-spending
Labor-controlled local governments.
   If miners and steelworkers were heroes of the Labor Party, small
businessmen were the heroes of Margaret Thatcher, inspired by her
father in whose grocery she helped out while growing up in the
north England town of Grantham. Taxes were cut, currency controls
abolished and an enlarged police force deployed to deal with strike
pickets now illegal under her union-curbing laws.
   By 1981 she was rated the most unpopular prime minister since
opinion polls began. But the following year came victory in the
74-day Falklands Islands war against Argentina. Her popularity
soared and she was re-elected in 1983 with an increased majority.
   It enabled her to carry on the revolution, and the fruits are
beginning to appear in a higher growth rate, a budget surplus and a
sustained consumer boom.
   Male average earnings at 273 pounds ($466) a week have risen by
nearly one-third in real terms since 1979.
   Two-thirds of Britons are homeowners, up from 50 percent in
1979. Trade union membership, down by one-third, is equaled by the
some nine million stock holders.
   But the number living on welfare has doubled to 9.4 million, or
17 percent of the population, official statistics indicate.
Unemployment is nearly 7 percent, higher than in most other
industrialized countries, and inflation nags away at 7.9 percent
forcing interest rates to stay high at 13 percent.
   Opinion polls indicate that while Britons don't like her, they
respect her. Now she is often accused of going too far.
   ``Change and reform have become ends in themselves,'' comments
the left-wing political scientist Ben Pimlott in the weekly New
Statesman and Society.
   ``This is a government and, above all, a prime minister, that
now believes it can break any convention, dispatch any sacred cow
to the abbatoir with absolute impunity.''
   Critics argue that Mrs. Thatcher has stayed in power on only 42
percent of the popular vote, because opposition parties are divided.
   The division between the prosperous south and
unemployment-stricken north also has widened in Mrs. Thatcher's
decade.
   It's not all her fault. The north has always been poorer than
the south. The Thatcher era happens to coincide with the decline of
heavy industry, the north's traditional mainstay, and the south's
closer proximity to the lucrative markets of continental Europe.

   But although the state spends more on the north than the south,
the predominant feeling among northerners is that Mrs. Thatcher
cares little for regions that are not natural Conservative
constituencies. Thus the Conservative vote has plummeted in the
north and in Scotland, separatist nationalism is at its strongest
in 10 years.
   Mrs. Thatcher has made the language of debate more combative and
divisive. She declares she wants to bury socialism in Britain, and
some opponents adopt the trappings of East European dissidents. The
latest anti-Thatcherite organization calls itself Charter 88,
modeled on Czechoslovakia's dissident Charter 77.
   Labor legislator Kim Howells acknowledges that when Mrs.
Thatcher came to power, ``The left was largely bankrupt of ideas
about what to do about British industry. It did not come to terms
with the things Thatcher was talking about ... in a sense we became
the reactionaries.''
   It's not only the left that Thatcherism has upset.
   Her policies have brought her into conflict with large parts of
the establishment: Church of England bishops, the British
Broadcasting Corp., the universities, even Queen Elizabeth II. The
queen was said to be upset over discord in the Commonwealth, the
association of former colonies, at Mrs. Thatcher's refusal to
impose tough economic sanctions on South Africa.
   The prime minister is also accused of being obsessed with
official secrecy and too eager to use the courts to gag disclosures
involving sensitive areas.
   Mrs. Thatcher is also widely accused of undermining free speech
with such measures as the banning of broadcast interviews with the
Irish Republican Army and its supporters, and the revision of the
78-year-old Official Secrets Act to make it even harder to report
news that the government feels should be suppressed.
   Her government's protracted and ultimately fruitless battle to
keep the retired secret service operative Peter Wright from
publishing ``Spycatcher,'' his memoirs, fuelled charges that she is
obsessed with secrecy.
   She argues that the ban on broadcasts of IRA interviews is
essential to fight terrorism, and that the Wright case was meant to
bind secret agents to their life-long secrecy oaths.
   But the results sometimes go palpably against the liberal
British grain: an issue of Harper's magazine with an article by a
former intelligence operative is banned in Britain; a BBC studio is
raided by police over a documentary on a secret spy satellite.
   ``She is destroying, or going a good way to destroy, some of our
finest institutions,'' said James Cornford, former professor of
olitics at Edinburgh University who heads a new left-wing think
tank, the Institute for Public Policy Research.
   ``I don't think she saved us from anything,'' he added in an
interview. ``And she has cost us a great deal.''
   The frustration of the intellectual left is compounded by the
existence of an entire generation that knows only Thatcherism.
   ``It's become sort of normal,'' Cornford said, recalling a
recent talk he gave to a group of high school seniors. ``It was
clear they really couldn't conceive of anybody else being prime
minister.''
   To her admirers, the Iron Lady _ a name given her by the Soviets
_ is a national savior who ended Britain's postwar cycle of
confrontation and decline. But the balance sheet remains
inconclusive.
   She has no clearly defined challenger in her own party, while
the opposition, split between Labor and the small, moderate center
parties, looks incapable of toppling her.
   Plans to privatize the national water supply and revamp property
taxes are arousing widespread suspicion. Doctors and lawyers,
ordinarily a Conservative constituency, are deeply hostile to her
proposals for reforming health and the legal profession.
   Critics point to Britain's creaking infrastructure _ congested
roads, a poorly run railway system, sewers dating to Victorian
times _ nd insist that Mrs. Thatcher is wrong to place the burden
of renewal on private investment.
   This happily married mother of twins is already talking of
beating all records by running for a fourth term in the 1990s.
   ``I think I have become a bit of an institution,'' she said
after her third election victory. ``And the place wouldn't be quite
the same without this old institution. People seem to think, `She
isn't so bad, is she, this Maggie.'''

   While she has reshaped Britain at home, Margaret
Thatcher has also put a forceful imprint on the international scene.
   Her strong personality, coupled with Britain's economic
comeback, has won her country a newfound measure of respect in
foreign capitals.
   Mrs. Thatcher scored her first foreign policy imprint soon after
coming to office in 1979, when her government settled the seemingly
intractable Rhodesia-Zimbabwe question in Africa. A treaty with
China resolving the future of Hong Kong followed in 1984.
   In 1982 she waged war with Argentina to recapture the Falkland
Islands, a British colony, and in 1986 she allowed the United
States to bomb Libya with aircraft based in Britain. Both were
lonely decisions that gave some credence to the title the Kremlin
had given her _ The Iron Lady.
   With President Ronald Reagan she found an instinctive affinity
of shared background and ideology, and Britain is the most devoted
U.S. ally in the Western world and there is no sign of any change
now that George Bush is in the White House.
   She was also the first major Western leader to gauge Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's mettle when he visited Britain in 1984 as the Kremlin's
No. 2 official. She called him a man ``I can do business with.''
   The relationship has blossomed through mutual visits. Gorbachev
clearly knows that the road to Western hearts and minds runs
through Mrs. Thatcher, wh is staunchly anti-communist. For her
part, she remains an unswervingly believer in nuclear deterrent and
sees herself as a brake on any Western temptation to succumb to
Gorbachev's charm and drop its nuclear guard.
   In the Middle East and Africa, her visits win warm receptions on
both sides of the respective divides, and she has won a degree of
trust by operating carefully impartial policies that could
ultimately win Britain a brokering role.
   Meanwhile, governments are eagerly studying the
``privatization'' policy Mrs. Thatcher adopted to rid the state of
loss-making industries. Britain happily exports its privatization
know-how to Western as well as Marxist governments.
   ``We are not posing as a superpower,'' says Foreign Secretary
Sir Geoffrey Howe.
   The days of Rule Britannia may be gone forever, but in the
weekly Economist's view, Mrs. Thatcher has regained for Britain
``the chance to suggest and shape policies rather than to react to
them.''

   For many, the drought of 1988 is a fading
nightmare. But to some farmers in the nation's heartland, it
remains a reality. In Iowa County, Iowa, which had its driest year
on record last year and the state's lowest corn yield, farmers are
apprehensive as they begin planting the 1989 crop. The ground is
dusty, creeks are dry and the mood is tense. In a two-part package,
The Associated Press profiles Iowa County farmers living with the
lingering drought and one who finally called it quits.

   Linda Yoder keeps a wary eye on grain
prices and she tracks the nation's weather patterns, waiting and
wondering if disaster will strike her land once again.
   The drought that turned her crops into shriveled stumps last
summer has not yet loosened its grip on her Iowa soil, and
apprehension has replaced the anticipation she normally feels at
planting time.
   ``I'm usually optimistic in the spring,'' Mrs. Yoder said. ``I'm
usually gung-ho ... to get out in the fields, to smell the fresh
dirt, put the crops in and watch them grow. It's like I'm renewed.
I'm not too renewed now. ... I sit here and I see no rain. I have
to say I'm a little nervous.''
   ``The drought to other people in this country is pretty much
over,'' the sixth-generation farmer said, ``but I'm sitting here
and it isn't.''
   This patch of eastern Iowa and several other areas, mostly in
the Corn Belt and Great Plains, have not rebounded from last year's
dry spell that rivaled the desperate Dust Bowl days. Pockets of
west-central Illinois, the Missouri-Iowa border, Kansas, the
Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming are among the areas considered by
experts to be in the severe-to-extreme drought category.
   In the South and West, the drought has either receded or it
wasn't as dramatic. Rising poultry profits and beef prices also
helped those areas.
   Concern about tough times prompted President Bush to announce a
speedup of about $850 million in crop payments to help farmers
early in the year.
   In Iowa, Gov. Terry Branstad has declared six counties
drought-disaster areas. And top lawmakers are seeking a drought
``master plan,'' as government reports say 94 percent of Iowa soil
is short of moisture.
   Nowhere is that more evident than Iowa County, where only half
the normal rainfall has fallen in the first three months of 1989,
following the driest year on record in 1988. Many farmers say they
need four to six inches of rain to replenish the soil this spring.
   Though it's premature to predict doom, there are some early
worrisome signs: the soil is dusty brown and some creeks are dry,
forcing many farmers to pump well water for cattle.
   ``It looks like August around here,'' said farmer Don Cronbaugh.
``I've never seen a spring where we just didn't have water
everywhere.''
   ``It has the potential where '89 could make '88 look like a
monsoon,'' he said.
   Hyperbole, perhaps, considering 1988's bleak legacy in this
rural county of 15,000.
   Precipitation was 15{-18 inches short of the 35-inch normal. The
county's 32 bushels-an-acre corn yield was Iowa's lowest. The
county produced 3.1 million bushels, compared with 14.2 million
bushels in 1987.
   Across Iowa, corn yields averaged 84 bushels an acre last year,
compared with 130 bushels in 1987. Precipitation statewide is about
half the normal amount this year, following Iowa's second-driest
year on record in 1988.
   Some losses have been offset by the $3.9 billion federal
disaster aid program. About $10.48 million has been distributed to
1,247 county producers. Some applications still are being processed.
   ``Everyone who farms got some kind of drought assistance,'' said
Irene O'Meara, county Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service director.
   Payments were provided to those who lost more than 35 percent of
their crop. In Iowa County, they ranged from a few hundred dollars
to the $100,000 maximum; the average was $10,000-$20,000.
   For many farmers, that wasn't enough to make 1988 profitable,
but it helped pay some of last year's debts and buy chemicals and
seed for this year, Mrs. O'Meara said.
   Mrs. Yoder, who farms about 500 acres with a neighbor, said
about $17,000 in disaster payments they shared helped her keep her
cattle and buy feed.
   But because she lost most of her crop, her income still was less
than half of what it would be in a decent year.
   Accepting drought aid from the government ``doesn't make me
happy,'' said Mrs. Yoder, whose husband works as an appliance
designer. But she compared it to an insurance policy.
   ``Farming and producing food are basic necessities of life. I've
heard people call it welfare and a free giveaway,'' she added. ``I
think that's wrong.''
   Already, Mrs. Yoder, who lives outside Marengo, is watching
weather patterns and hoping they'll be better than 1988, when her
pastures were burned up by June and her corn averaged nine bushels
an acre, compared with her average 135 bushels an acre.
   She also lost about two-thirds of her soybeans.
   Mrs. Yoder, who has two daughters, captured her misery on
videotape ``so my children will have something to remember. ... If
I told you 30 years from now I averaged nine bushels, are you going
to believe me? The corn was 3-foot tall! I've never seen 3-foot
tall corn in my life. ... I hope I don't have to do that again.
(But) I may ...''
   There have never been two consecutive drought years, but if that
happens, some farmers say that could doom them.
   ``If it's dry this year, there's going to be a lot of farmers, I
might be one included, that are not going to make it,'' said Leslie
Slaymaker, who has 240 acres near Victor, on the county's western
edge.
   Slaymaker and others worry because they have no cushion to fall
back on like they did a year ago. Much surplus has been sold off
and the ground is drier than it was in the spring of 1988.
   ``It's a bigger risk planting crops and trying to get something
out of them,'' Slaymaker said. ``There's no way we can catch up,
even in the growing season.''
   ``It's going to have to be an extraordinarily good year to be an
average crop year,'' said Cronbaugh, who said government aid _
about $8,000 _ and good livestock prices eased some of his losses
in a year when more than 80 percent of his corn was wiped out.
   Some farmers already are considering alternatives if 1989 is
dry. Some will switch to more soybeans, which have a later planting
season and tend to be more resilient. Others may participate in a
program that allows farmers to idle corn acreage and receive
so-called deficiency payments.
   Some, though, remain philosophical.
   ``You can't lose any sleep over it,'' Cronbaugh said. ``You take
care of it the best you can and you do the best you can.''
   And after 15 years of farming, Mrs. Yoder's not giving up.
   ``Don't ask me why,'' she said. ``There's no moisture, no extra
money. ``Why? Because we're optimists ... and because we enjoy
doing it. It's a way of life.''

   For the first spring in 19 years, Duane
Schaefer starts his workday with a dark-of-night drive past quiet
moonlit fields. This is the season of rebirth _ and he's on his way
to a new life.
   At 42, the third-generation farmer has called it quits. No more
crops to plant, no soil to till. No more weather worries, either.
There were enough of those in the Great Drought of '88, when
Schaefer decided to make the break.
   ``I guess it pushed me over the edge,'' the burly, proud
ex-farmer said of the dry spell that followed years of debt and
decline. Last spring, he still hoped to hang on to the only career
he'd ever known.
   ``I wanted to give it one more good try,'' said Schaefer, who
now works overnights at an auto parts plant. ``We gave it our all
and it forgot to rain.''
   ``When I decided to quit, I felt like a failure,'' he said.
``The farther I get away, the less I feel that way. ... I feel
better now than I have in the last 20 years. I'm more optimistic I
can make something of myself.''
   Experts don't yet know what impact the drought will have on the
'80s rural exodus that already has seen more than 1 million people
leave the land and 273,000 farms go out of business. But they say
America's heartland, parts of which remain parched, will likely see
the greatest thinning of ranks.
   ``We do anticipate some exiting of farmers, particularly in the
northern Plains and part of the western Corn Belt,'' said Gregory
Hanson, an Agriculture Department economist. He said the rate will
be higher than in drought-recovered areas such as the South.
   ``What we saw in 1988 was a tightening of the noose around the
necks of some of the more heavily indebted farmers,'' explained
Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economics professor.
   The most vulnerable farmers, he said, had little or no crop and
no surplus. Prospects were even bleaker for those without crop
insurance.
   A recent Agriculture Department report said the drought put
10,000-15,000 of 550,000 commercial farmers on the ropes. That
number would be doubled if not for a $3.9 billion federal aid
package, the report said.
   Still, experts don't expect widespread flight because 1986 and
'87 were good crop years and the '80s farm crisis already had
forced out many on the edge.
   Risks remain for farmers in still dry areas such as eastern
Iowa. A second straight bad year in 1989 could force them out.
   Schaefer, who was renting 1,450 acres, didn't wait.
   He sold out in December after losing 75 percent of his corn and
35 percent of his soybeans.
   ``You could compare it to being unemployed,'' he said. ``There
isn't any income coming in.''
   Schaefer sold surplus grain and received a substantial disaster
payment _ $52,000 _ but he wasn't close to breaking even. About
two-thirds of his grain proceeds paid a government loan and the
disaster aid went toward bank debts, Schaefer said.
   What's more, he added, his rent and planting costs were about
$250,000 a year.
   ``A guy getting a paycheck for $20,000-$30,000 ... thinks, `This
guy got $52,000 from the government,''' he said. ``People don't
understand the amount it takes to operate a farm. It goes back to
debt and land. It's not net money. ... The farmer doesn't see it
very long.''
   Still, he said, without aid, ``I would have had the banker
breathing down my neck. I probably would have declared bankruptcy.''
   Schaefer said he tired of living with too much stress and
unsteadiness and too little satisfaction.
   He endured four droughts since 1976; 1988 was the worst.
   ``You make money for three years, then a drought comes along,''
he said. ``Then you lose everything you made in the last three.''
   ``The last few years, it was more of a pain than enjoyment,''
Schaefer said. ``I could see people coming home with a paycheck. My
paycheck was a gamble. ... Everytime I remotely start thinking
about (farming), I think of a paycheck on Friday night. It's a sure
thing.'' ''
   That's some solace for Schaefer, his wife, Susan, a part-time
substitute teacher, and their two children.
   ``I'm 42. I'm looking at 65,'' Schaefer said. ``If I'm doing
this, every two-three years there's not going to be anything there.
I want to get to a place where I can set money aside.''
   Mrs. Schaefer said she, too, was ``tired of the uncertainty. I
wanted him to get out of it. But in the back of my head, I said,
`He's good at this.'''
   Schaefer's boom-to-bust tale started in 1971, when he began
farming after earning an accounting degree. Gradually, he bought
tens of thousands of dollars' worth of equipment, rented more acres
and purchased a house.
   ``Everyone was borrowing,'' he said. ``You didn't want to say no
if it was offered. ... When you walked out the door of the bank,
they said, `Is that enough?'''
   But in the '80s, interest rates soared, land values fell and
Schaefer amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt. In 1985,
he averted foreclosure but lost his house and farm in a settlement
with the Federal Land Bank. His land, once worth $2,700 an acre,
dropped to $800 an acre.
   The Schaefers moved nearby and continued farming. Despite the
hard times, Schaefer said his banker urged him to continue in 1989.
   ``With a little creative financing, we could have survived,'' he
conceded. ``All you're doing is borrowing yourself more trouble.
... you're borrowing against the future. ... I got tired of that.''
   ``He's very honorable,'' said Irene O'Meara, county Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service director. Her husband owned
some of the land Schaefer rented.
   ``A lot (of farmers) will stay in a year or two ... and take
bankruptcy. The creditors don't get paid,'' she said. ``He said,
`I'll quit while I can still pay everybody off.'
   ``He deserved better,'' Mrs. O'Meara added, ``but then what can
you do? ... You go on hope for a few years. After a while, you
don't feel it's fair to your family.''
   Schaefer works the midnight-8 a.m. shift at an auto stamping
plant 21 miles away.
   ``I feel like I'm starting closer to the bottom than I'd
planned,'' he said. ``I didn't expect to get a $30,000-a-year job.
(But) I didn't expect trouble getting a $15,000-$16,000 a year job.
There's a lot of young stallions out there.''
   The upside, Schaefer said, is that for the first time in 22
years he has paid most of his debts, using proceeds from the sale
of machinery and assets.
   ``It's going to bother me when someone farms the ground I was
farming,'' he said. ``(But) the fact I don't have to worry about it
... is a relief. If it dries up this summer, I'll laugh.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Twenty years ago a catchy country song put a
colorful Oklahoma town on the map as a place where nobody smoked
marijuana, burned draft cards or wore hippie sandals. To the
homefolk, the song was an inaccurate joke. However, they remain
today proud to be Okies from Muskogee, but for other, lesser-known
reasons.

<DATELINE>MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   According to Police Chief Gary Sturm,
most of the robbings and thievings and shootings in this town, as
in towns large and small across America, are accountable to the
drug trade.
   Whoa now, chief. Haven't you heard the song?
   Anyone over 35 who owns a radio and has an ear for country music
has to believe that if there is one drug-free zone anywhere in the
land it has to be Muskogee, Okla.
   Twenty years ago _ has it been that long? _ Merle Haggard, the
songwriter and guitar picker, put Muskogee on the map as a place
where true Americans lived and had their red, white and blue values
well in hand.
   Muskogee, he sang, during that era of protest, was where nobody
smoked marijuana, burned draft cards or wore hippie sandals.
Instead they waved Old Glory, pitched woo and wore manly leather
boots.
   Sing along with ol' Merle:
   ``I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
   ``A place where even squares can have a ball...''
   What went wrong, chief?
   ``Well, the song didn't describe Muskogee then or now,'' Carl
Sturm was saying the other day. Sturm and has lived here all his
life. He was just out of high school when the song was sweeping the
charts and making everybody in town a bit dizzy.
   Sturm is indeed proud of his hometown and believes its people
are as true-blue as any Americans.
   But he shakes his head at the irony that Muskogee, of all
places, would be singled out for the sake of a clever rhyme as the
sort of town that might inspire a Norman Rockwell.
   ``Of course people smoked marijuana in Muskogee,'' he says.
   ``I didn't, but I knew you could buy it in bars and nightclubs
around town. It was sold in matchboxes, $5 a box I believe. You
could also get amphetamines and barbiturates.
   ``But marijuana wasn't grown around here. All that stuff was
imported.
   ``I think Merle Haggard understood that Oklahoma has always been
slow about picking up on trends from the East and West coasts. Even
something as innocent as the price of gasoline. When gas went up to
$1.25 in L.A. it was still 80-cents in Muskogee. When it got to
$1.25 in Muskogee it was back to 80-cents in L.A.
   ``Today they've gotten around to growing some of the best
marijuana in the United States near here _ now that cocaine is big
everywhere else.
   ``We busted some guys recently with some crack that the Los
Angeles police department identified as coming from there. So now
we have crack here in Muskogee, and it has become a major problem.
We're catching guys setting up laboratories out in the backwoods.''
   ``Gary's right,'' says Jim East, a boyhood friend of the police
chief. ``What we resented was being pictured as behind the times,
although we were. We hated that song.''
   Jim East graduated in 1972, two years after the town fathers,
perhaps sensing a national trend, finally merged the all-black
Manual High School with the all-white Central High School into one,
Muskogee High School. Jim East now is a reporter in Tulsa.
   ``Back then,'' he says, ``the term Okie was a put-down, like
hick or redneck. Merle Haggard changed that, I'll say that for him.
   ``But at the time, people taunted us with the song. I was on the
Muskogee High wrestling team. I remember one out-of-town match that
wound up in a fistfight when the other guys called us Okies from
Muskogee. Sang it at us.
   ``When they put the damn song on the cafeteria jukebox we yanked
the cord and shoved the box down a flight of stairs. When we heard
that Merle Haggard was coming to Muskogee for a performance, we
plotted to hide in the bed of a pickup and waylay him on Highway
69. We didn't, but I didn't go to the performance, either.
   ``We were prouder of Muskogee being the one-time stomping ground
of Ma Barker and Pretty Boy Floyd and other bad people. That was
its real heritage.''
   After 20 years, any bitterness over the song seems to have
mellowed.
   Now Muskogeeans traveling out of the state smile benignly when a
desk clerk says, ``Oh, a real Okie from Muskogee,'' being original.
   ``I used to tell people I was from Tulsa,'' says Jim East.
   Now Muskogeeans regard The Song as something best forgotten from
long ago, like a broken Indian treaty. It was, after all, just
another episode in the life of a town that doesn't require a catchy
country parody to define its personality and style.
   Was Muskogee really the stomping ground of desperadoes?
   ``Yes it was,'' says Chief Sturm, ``and take a look at this.''
   He took from a file cabinet a copy of ``Men'' magazine with a
feature titled ``Muskogee: Sin Mill of the Southwest.'' The story
detailed wide_open gambling, bootlegging and prostitution.
   The edition was dated 1953. That would have been four years
after the feds put away Muskogee Sheriff Eddie Briggs, known as the
kingpin of Muskogee's bootleggers, and two years after Leslie Scott
was elected constable despite three arrests for running gambling
operations.
   Even during the '60s, Muskogeeans didn't seem to have much truck
with reformers. In 1964 somebody dynamited Police Chief Earl
Newton's car. In 1968 somebody shot up Police Chief George Spence's
home. He quit and his successor was chased out of town along with
the city manager and a reform-minded city councilman, whose music
store was bombed. That was the real Muskogee.
   ``Here's another keepsake,'' Sturm says, fetching a device with
dice enclosed in a plastic bubble. ``It's called a jiggler.
Hundreds of them were made in a garage here in Muskogee. We raided
one place that had a 300-pound magnet under the dice table.
Jigglers made sure nobody could switch the dice or even touch them.
   ``There's no more regular back-room gambling now, though. Too
risky.
   ``Our criminals are more inept, too. Not long ago a couple of
guys lay in wait for a big winner in a poker game, shot him, and
got away with about 20 bucks. They reached in the wrong pocket. He
had several thousand in the one they didn't turn inside out.

   ``As for prostitution, we closed down our last brothel last
year. It was run by an old classmate of mine, John Lyman _ a
massage parlor in the Bambi Motel. Since then the motel burned
down. I think the neighbors...probably are glad.''
   Moonshine? A Muskogeean, Gov. J. Howard Edmondson, put an end to
it by persuading Oklahoma voters to legalize liquor in 1960, the
second to last state to do so, a step ahead of Mississippi.
   ``There's still a little moonshining going on,'' says Chief
Sturm, ``but just for home consumption. You know, for tradition.''
   Is Muskogee finally catching up to The Song after 20 years,
getting straight-laced? ``A nice thought,'' says Sturm.
   Even at the time of The Song, at least one potential pot
purchaser didn't believe the business about marijuana.
   As Lonzo ``Slick'' Smith recalls it, a kid came into his
barbecue joint and asked where he could get some grass.
   Slick has been in business at the same spot on Shawnee Boulevard
for 28 years. His barbecue can hold its own with any in the
Southwest, but it is his only product.
   ``I had some old ratty Mexican cigarettes somebody had given
me,'' he recalls. ``They were terrible to smoke and worse to look
at. I handed the kid a few of them and he handed me $5.
   ``He never came back, but the word got out that I was dealing
the stuff.''
   Over the years, Muskogee's politics have been as rollicking as
Muskogee's vice. On one Election Day a ballot box was tossed into
the Arkansas River lest it be counted.
   Of all the town's politicians, John Monks would win the prize,
although the vote would be close.
   Other candidates would include, for example, a Muskogee
watchmaker named Wilbur Wright. Not a bad name for a politician.
   In 1970, the year The Song was at its peak of popularity, Wilbur
paid the filing fee and entered his name for labor commissioner, an
obscure state office long since without purpose but somehow left on
the ballot.
   Wilbur won unopposed.
   Soon he was caught padding his expense account. He pleaded
guilty and resigned.
   Not to be dismayed, next election he filed again. His primary
opponent this time was a former state trooper named Will Rogers.
Not a bad Oklahoma name either.
   In a battle of names, the revered airplane inventor, dead 62
years, won over the sainted humorist, dead 39 years.
   At length, Oklahoma voters found a sensible solution. They
abolished the job.
   Incidentally, if you should notice an elderly gent wheeling
around Muskogee in a blue pickup with a big yellow palomino horse
for a hood ornament, that will be Wilbur Wright's brother, Orville.
   John Monks is a horse of another color.
   Monks is a big man with a big voice, square jaw, rusty hair,
flashing eyes. He laughs easily and loud. He feels that he
represents a majority of Muskogeeans. ``Hell, they elected me ten
times, didn't they?''
   Voters have never had a doubt where John Monks stands on issues.
He's against.
   He's against the feminists, against their Equal Rights
Amendment, against the seat-belt law.``I know seat belts save
lives, but people should have the freedom to choose.'' He's against
``perverts'' and ``pantywaists'' but insists he is impartial. ``I
include both sexes.''
   Above all, John Monks, a member of three veterans'
organizations, is against communism.
   His brightest moment in 20 years in the legislature _ his hazel
eyes light up when he recalls it _ was his speech against a bill to
outlaw cockfighting in Oklahoma.
   After expounding on the history of the manly sport, he paused
for effect and delivered his peroration:
   ``The first thing the communists do when they take over a
country,'' John Monks thundered, ``is to outlaw cockfighting.''
   Simultaneously, he switched on a tape recording of roosters
crowing. In the gallery, his Muskogee supporters waved little
American flags on sticks and crowed along, cock-a-doodle-do.
   The bill went down to hilarious defeat.
   ``No,'' John Monks confesses, ``Muskogee wasn't the way the song
said it was, but that was the way it ought to have been.''
   While Muskogeeans were sending John Monks to the legislature
they were also sending Mike Synar to Congress. Rep. Synar is rated
by Americans for Democratic Action to be the most liberal of the
nine-member Oklahoma delegation.
   ``If you try to categorize our voters, you're on a fool's
errand,'' says Gene Wallace, Rep. Synar's aide in Muskogee.
   ``Ninety-something percent of the voters in this district have
lived in the same house for 20 years. Home ownership here is higher
than in most places in the United States. Our people understand
their values if others don't. They like where they live and how
they live and see no contradictions in the way they vote.''
   Muskogee, at the confluence of three rivers, grew out of one of
the territory's oldest trading posts. It was the agency for the
Five Civilized Tribes _ the old building still stands, now a museum
_ when the U.S. drove those hapless souls out of the East, gave
them the eastern half of Oklahoma, then took great chunks of it
back, including Muskogee. The town's population of about 42,000
hasn't changed much in decades.
   The state's first governor, whose name, Charles Nathaniel
Haskell, is largely forgotten here, was from Muskogee. Merle Ronald
Haggard, whose name is widely remembered, was not.
   In fact, Haggard, an orphan at 9, spent more time in his youth
in San Quentin (two years for armed robbery; pardoned by Gov.
Ronald Reagan) than he ever spent in Muskogee.
   Haggard's father was born in Checotah, 20 miles south of here.
He was a Dust Bowl refugee and his son was born in 1937 in a boxcar
in Bakersfield, Calif.
   The songwriter, vacationing aboard his houseboat on California's
Lake Shasta, was unavailable to talk about Muskogee. However, his
road manager and drummer the past 21 years, Biff Adams, recalls
well the origin of The Song.
   ``Merle had the idea in his mind, a song practically written,
about small-town America and people who were not hippies or
protesters,'' Adams recalls. ``It might have been any town, and it
didn't have to be literally accurate.''
   He recalls the day in 1969 when the band bus was headed north
out of Texas on Highway 69 on the way to a gig. They stopped
briefly in Checotah where Haggard visited an uncle.
   ``You wouldn't expect him to write that he was proud to be an
Okie from Checotah, would you?'' said Adams. ``It doesn't fit.
   But just out of town we saw a sign that said `Muskogee 20
miles'.''
   ``I bet they don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee,'' Merle Haggard
said, reaching for his guitar.
   The rest of the lines came easy.

   MUSKOGEE, Okla. (AP) _ Here are the lyrics to the song ``Okie
from Muskogee,'' written by Merle Haggard in 1969:
   
   We don't smoke marijuana in Muskogee;
   We don't take our trips on LSD.
   We don't burn our draft cards down on Main Street,
   'Cause we like livin' right and bein' free.
   We don't make a party out of lovin',
   But we like holding hands and pitchin' woo.
   We don't let our hair grow long and shaggy
   Like the hippies out in San Francisco do.
   
   I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
   A place where even squares can have a ball.
   We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
   And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all.
   
   Leather boots are still in style for manly footwear.
   Beads and Roman sandals won't be seen.
   Football's still the roughest thing on campus,
   And the kids here still respect the college dean.
   
   And I'm proud to be an Okie from Muskogee,
   A place where even squares can have a ball.
   We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
   And white lightnin's still the biggest thrill of all.
   
   We still wave Old Glory down at the courthouse,
   In Muskogee, Oklahoma, U.S.A.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Innocent victims of the years of war in Vietnam
are millions of children without enough to eat, many being treated
in hospitals without enough medicine and supplies. Inadequate
medical care is one of the legacies of the Communists who won the
war but didn't know how to manage the country in peacetime. The
second of three articles.

   The Vietnamese mothers stand
patiently in the bare, overcrowded wards of Pediatric Hospital No.
1, holding their babies in their arms, trying to soothe the
onslaught of illness and pain.
   In these wards are the innocent victims of five decades of war
and a failed economy that has left Vietnamese hospitals drained of
even simple supplies such as sutures, X-ray film and anesthesia.
   The signs of malnutrition are everywhere: shriveled children
weighing only half what they should, their bellies swollen, their
muscles wasting away, their skin peeling and scabbed, their eyes
blinded.
   In the burn ward, tiny bodies wrapped in gauze soaked with
ointment writhe in pain, their hands tethered to keep them from
contracting and deforming, their faces fixed with fear.
   These children were born into a political and economic schism
that has isolated Vietnam from most of the Western world and the
aid it needs so badly. The Vietnamese government spent years
subsidizing war against the French, Japanese, Americans, Chinese
and Cambodians instead of investing in medicine, science, education
and the care of its 64 million people.
   North Vietnam won the war in 1975, two years after U.S. military
forces left South Vietnam for good, but its aging communist
leadership lost the battle to manage the country in peacetime.
After the war, Vietnam closed itself off from the outside world and
did little to improve its socialistic lot.
   Indeed, many hospitals such as Pediatric No. 1 are old and
ill-equipped, inviting infections. Plaster roofs are caving in,
air-conditioners are covered with rust and water seeps across the
floors. Most hospitals haven't received any new equipment since the
end of the war.
   A typical provincial 400-bed general hospital in Tay Ninh west
of Ho Chi Minh City has a budget of only $32,500 a year to treat
more than 100,000 patients and pay a staff of nearly 500 people.
Despite a 100-bed surgical ward, it has less than half of the
surgical tools it needs, forcing patients to wait for surgery.
Surgeons earn a base pay of only $6 a month, what an American
teen-ager makes in an hour or two at McDonald's.
   ``The most important problem for us is the problem of
equipment,'' says Dr. Nguyen Huy Phan, a plastic surgeon and
leading member of the State Committee for Science and Technology.
   ``It's desperate,'' says Dr. John Constable, a plastic surgeon
at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who was in Vietnam on
his 11th visit to study the effects of Agent Orange and to teach.
   Vietnam was distracted from building its economy, its trade and
its institutions in 1978 when its armed forces invaded and occupied
Cambodia and later fought China in a northern border war.
   Western nations, including the United States, ostracized Vietnam
for its occupation of Cambodia. The United States refuses to
establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam and give it aid until
it pulls all of its forces out of Cambodia, elections are held, and
Cambodia is neutral and non-aligned.
   Vietnam claims it has withdrawn all but 50,000 of its troops and
will have those out by Sept. 30. Acknowledging its economic
policies have failed, Vietnam is courting the United States and its
capitalism as a prelude to what it hopes will be the lifting of an
American trade embargo and the return of economic, medical and
management aid.
   Vietnam now survives on aid from the Soviet Union and some
humanitarian aid from some Western countries. Some assitance comes
from non-government charitable organizations and individuals in the
United States, including the American Friends Service Committee in
Philadelphia, a Quaker group, and World Vision, a Monrovia, Calif.,
Christian agency. Increasingly, Vietnam veterans are lending a hand.
   Seven American plastic surgeons and two other physicians, the
first group of American doctors to work in Vietnam since the end of
the war, operated on 101 children in February to correct mouth
deformities, including cleft lips, as part of ``Operation Smile,''
a Norfolk, Va., based charitable agency.
   ``Every time I come, I bring them a couple of thousand dollars
worth of sutures,'' says Constable of Massachusetts General. ``They
go very fast.''
   `It's a social economic problem, not only a medical problem,''
says Dr. Tran Ngoc Manh, a vice director of Pedatric Hospital No.
1, which cares for children from birth to age 15 in Ho Chi Minh
City and 14 provinces to the south.

   Vietnam is so poor that most babies have never known the taste
of cow's milk, barely surviving on a steady diet of water and rice,
many so helpless they are unable to escape the companions of
malnutrition: pneumonia, bronchitis, diarrhea, and, too often,
death.
   ``If they are malnourished, they can have pulmonary diseases,''
says Dr. Tran Tan Tram, another vice director of Pediatric Hospital
No. 1. ``Where you have pulmonary infections, you can have
malnourishment.''
   A 2-month-old child reared on rice soup since birth is unable to
open its eyes. ``In our country, many patients are blind because of
a lack of vitaman A,'' Manh says.
   UNICEF, the United Nations Childrens Fund, estimates that about
40 percent of Vietnam's 9 million children under age 5 are
suffering from malnutrition. Vietnamese medical experts report that
despite education programs, there has been no substantial
improvement in the last 25 years.
   Eighteen percent of Vietnam's children are born underweight at
5{ pounds or less, and are more likely to be malnourished and
vulnerable to other diseases. ``This is a very high figure, very
dramatic, one of the highest of any country in the world'' says Leo
Goldstone, a senior adviser at UNICEF in New York.
   ``The country is short of food because of a series of crop
failures and some natural disasters like cyclones. The people don't
have enough incentive to grow food. The first people to suffer are
the mothers and children.''
   Worse yet, Vietnam's infant mortality rate is seven times that
of the United States. Of every 1,000 children born in Vietnam, 91
die before age 5 and 65 die before age 1. In the United States, of
every 1,000 children born, 13 die before age 5 and 10 die before
age 1.
   Unrelenting infectious diseases ambush the malnourished and
unvaccinated children of a medically indigent country: pneumonia,
polio, measles, diphtheria, diarrhea, tuberculosis, rabies, plague,
leprosy, tetanus. A major killer is pneumonia, responsible for
one-third of childhood deaths. The huge river basins of Vietnam
spawn fatal doses of malaria.
   The antiquated medical system, short of hospitals, vaccine,
antitoxin, antibiotics and vitamins, is unable to launch an
effective counterattack. Only half the children and their mothers
are immunized. A $15 series of shots could save lives, but who can
afford them in a country where the per capita income is not much
above $100 a year.
   So short of everything are the hospitals that they sometimes
gamble with antibiotics outdated in the United States, such as
streptomycin, ignoring its possible side effects of deafness and
dizziness. Sometimes the treatment of a patient may depend on the
family bringing in its own drugs. Vietnamese children are still
stricken with poliomyelitis and rickets that vaccines and vitamins
vanquished long ago in the United States.
   Even those who are lucky enough to recover from meningitis,
encephalitis and poliomyelitis are often left deaf, blind,
retarded, paralyzed or disfigured, requiring repeated surgery and
long-term therapy.
   Thousands of disabled children 7-to-15 years old have lost their
arms or legs in accidents, to disease and to mines and unexploded
shells left over from the war. So dirt-poor are the children, they
are willing to risk the dangerous task of rummaging through old
American bases for valuable shell casings which can be sold for
scrap metal.
   Frederick Downs, director of prosthetics and sensory aids
service in the U.S. Veterans Administration in Washington, says
Vietnam has ``good medical people, but they're lacking in four
areas: vaccines, drugs, medical supplies, and nutritional
products.''
   Many parents have no knowledge of how to take care of their
children. ``We have to educate them,'' says Manh of Pediatric
Hospital. ``Nutrition can protect children against disease.''
   To do this, the hospital staff conducts classes for mothers,
demonstrating how to prepare inexpensive nutritional foods using
rice, oil, vegetables, peanuts and soy beans.
   Most families can't afford much else. Some of the burn victims
land in the hospital because they are left unattended by mothers
who have to work along with the fathers in order to survive.
   Because Phan is the only plastic surgeon in the entire country,
the children with severe burns who need skin grafts suffer
unnecessarily, skin meshed to skin, contracting itself,
immobilizing their joints.
   You can hear their cries in the hospitals:
   ``Mommy, it hurts so much.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Law enforcement journals are describing a
``satanic threat'' in America and seminars on occult crime are
attracting hundreds of police officers in cities across the
country. While some experts insist the threat has been exaggerated,
the Matamoros slayings have rekindled the debate.

   The ritual slayings of 15 people by a
drug-smuggling ring in northern Mexico underscore the need for
police to be trained to recognize the signs of all kinds of occult
crime, according to a growing group of ``cult cops.''
   While the Matamoros slayings apparently had nothing to do with
devil worship, satanism has become a hot topic in law enforcement
circles.
   Law enforcement officials nationwide note an increase in reports
of satanic grafitti, animal mutilations and signs that occult
rituals have taken place. But some say the threat is being
exaggerated.
   Nonetheless, a seminar on satanism and crime sponsored by the
Connecticut State Police last month attracted more than 300 police
officers from all over New England who wanted to learn how to
distinguish serious satanists from teen-age pranksters and how to
respond to each.
   Sober law enforcement journals are running articles describing a
``satanic threat'' and telling police how to spot evidence at crime
scenes that might be overlooked by those unfamiliar with cult
practices.
   Among the new breed of cult cops, sometimes derided as
``ghostbusters'' by their colleagues, is Detective Sgt. Alan L.
Alves of Freetown. Alves has never made an arrest for a satanic
crime and has found no evidence of human sacrifices. But he's
convinced such ritual murders are occurring.
   ``The organized satanists leave absolutely no evidence,'' Alves
says. ``They're killing. That's what they believe in. They have to
make sacrifices. They're killing babies.''
   The Matamoros killings were not related to satanism, according
to Thomas Wedge, a former Union, Ohio, deputy sheriff and the
author of ``The Satan Hunter.'' Wedge makes his living lecturing
about satanism, mainly to law enforcement groups.
   Wedge, reached in Baton Rouge, La., where he was conducting a
seminar for the state police, said the Matamoros killers were
practicing a black magic version of brujeria, an Afro-Caribbean
religion.
   ``This is not an isolated case by any means,'' he said, adding
that he knows of at least one other ritual killing by drug dealers.
   Wedge said brujeria is practiced by many Cuban criminals who
came to the United States on the Mariel boat lift.
   Other experts dispute Wedge's contention that brujeria was to
blame.
   Among them is Robert D. Hicks, a criminal justice analyst for
the state of Virginia, and a former police officer in Tucson,
Ariz., where he had firsthand experience with drug smugglers and
brujeria, which gets its name from the Spanish word for witch _
brujo.
   Brujo, who are found in the Caribbean, Mexico and in Hispanic
communities all over the United States, are witch doctors or wise
men who may also practice some magic, Hicks says, but the vast
majority are peaceful and law-abiding.
   Hicks says the Matamoros killers may have drawn on elements of
the religion to promise their followers magical immunity to
bullets. Or, the cult leaders, including Alfonso de Jesus
Constanzo, a Cuban-American, may have just had an appetite for
blood and wanted to terrorize competitors and police.
   ``In northern Mexico, drug trafficking is intensely
competitive,'' Hicks says. ``Nobody knows at the moment if
Constanzo actually has some deep, abiding faith that pushed him to
commit these crimes, or if he was just a slick operator who made it
up as he went along.''
   Hicks, who is writing a book critical of the ``satanism scare''
in law enforcement circles, says the real danger is that police may
begin trampling on the religious freedoms of those who practice
non-Christian beliefs, even though there is no evidence of
criminality.
   The FBI's chief expert on cult crime, Kenneth V. Lanning, and
other law enforcement officials contacted around the country said
there is no solid evidence that crimes committed by satan
worshipers are on the increase in America.
   ``I question whether there is a true increase,'' says Lanning,
supervisory special agent at the FBI's behavioral sciences unit in
Quantico, Va., who is frequently contacted by local officials
seeking help on cases with cult overtones.
   But Wedge insists satanists have been thriving on police
ignorance and disbelief.
   ``It doesn't really matter what you or I believe,'' Wedge says.
``It's what they believe that's dangerous.''
   Connecticut state police have noticed an increase in the number
of phone callers reporting satanic activity, particularly around
Halloween.
   ``We've only had incidents of things that could be classified as
a bona fide satanic ritual, and those things did not involve any
criminal acts except minor things like criminal trespass or illegal
bonfires,'' says Sgt. Scott O'Mara.

   O'Mara says the reports may be the result of increased media
attention.
   ``Anytime a bunch of kids got together and built a bonfire in an
isolated area, someone a few years ago would have called and said,
`There are a bunch of rowdy kids behind my house with a bonfire,'''
he said. ``Now they call and say, `There are a bunch of kids
practicing satanism behind my house.'''
   There is no doubt that occult trappings are in vogue among some
teens, who can be seen wearing pentagram earrings, listening to
heavy metal music with ominous lyrics, or even staging mock black
masses.
   What is in dispute is whether the fad is inspiring crime.
   Lanning says teen satanists _ true believers or imitators _
probably are responsible for some of the animal mutilations and
occult grafitti police have discovered.
   But though devil worship is also blamed for teen suicides and
some homicides, it is not clear how many of the people who say the
devil made them do it are actually cult-influenced.
   ``If that's a satanic crime, then what do we call the hundreds
of crimes committed by people who say God told them to do it, Jesus
told them to do it, an angel told them to do it?'' Lanning says.
``Are we going to call them Christian crimes?''
   Lanning and others point to other unsubstantiated allegations
made at some police seminars: allegations that satanic cults are
engaged in the widespread ritual abuse of children; that women are
being ``bred'' to produce babies that are sacrificed in satanic
rituals, and that cultists are encouraged, even driven, to murder.
   ``Cops, who are usually cynical and skeptical and have to have
everything proved to them, some of them go to these conferences and
buy this stuff, hook, line and sinker,'' Lanning says.
   Statements of questionable accuracy are found even in some law
enforcement publications.
   For example, the Massachusetts State Police sent its troopers a
newsletter on satanism last summer. To help police spot possible
outbreaks, the newsletter included a calendar of occult holidays
and a catalog of satanic symbols. And it declared, without citing a
source, that ``throughout the United States and Canada, there has
been a dramatic increase in the ritual abuse of children, most
often by satanic cults.''
   ``That statement is hype as it relates to Massachusetts,'' said
Essex County District Attorney Kevin Burke. ``We have not had a
report of ritualistic child abuse.''
   David G. Bromley, a sociologist at Virginia Commonwealth
University in Richmond, Va., sees not an increase in satanic crime,
but a ``cult scare'' that has more to do with urban legends and
modern psychology than with criminology.
   ``I think it's all a hoax,'' says Bromley, who investigated
allegations of cult ``brainwashing'' in the 1970s that were never
proven. He is now examining the satanism scare and suspects it may
be a similar phenomenon.
   Bromley says rumors and stories circulating about rings of
adults who start day care centers for the purpose of finding
children to abuse in satanic rituals are ``sheer fantasy'' _ but
fantasy fed by reports of real child abuse and by today's parents'
guilt and fears of entrusting their children to strangers.
   ``It is not coincidental that allegations of satanic
conspiracies are centered on day care centers,'' he says.
   Lanning said statisics cited at police seminars exactly
duplicate the wave of reports about missing children in the early
1980s _ reports found on closer scrutiny to be greatly exaggerated.
   ``In 1983, we were told that 50,000 kids a year were being
kidnapped by pedophiles,'' he said. ``Now we're told that 50,000
kids a year are being kidnapped by satanists.''
   Such explanations do not satisfy Alves. Initially he dismissed
as nonsense reports of evil doings in the woods and hunters'
sitings of people in red robes around campfires.
   But in a stretch of state forest so secluded that it takes an
hour's walk on trails and a few hundred yards' bushwhacking to
reach, he has found an abandoned shack spray-painted with
pentagrams and other occult symbols.
   Dolls stuck with pins have been nailed to the remnants of a
6-foot cross. Nearby is a toddler-size throne carved from a tree
stump. It is only 18 inches tall and has indentations in the seat
so small that no adult could sit on it.
   Three other huts in the woods, a desecrated grave and several
animal mutilations in nearby New Bedford also point to cult
activity in the area, Alves says.
   Law enforcement officials agree that police must be able to
separate fact from fantasy if they are to investigate such crimes
properly or locate the culprits.
   ``Because a kid sprays a pentagram on a building doesn't mean
he's willing to go sacrifice a human life,'' O'Mara says. ``But if
you have a scene with all the trappings that indicate that someone
is very much involved in satanism, would they be capable?''

   Former cop Michael J. Nelson once was
described as ``walking a beat with one foot in the Twilight Zone.''
He's in it up to his elbows now, at the price of a once-promising
career.
   Nelson, former chief of detectives in Hendricks County west of
here, quit when Sheriff Roy W. Waddell told him he no longer could
pursue an investigation of satanic rituals that began with a spate
of grave desecrations 18 months ago.
   A private investigator now, he helps alleged victims of
satanists. But he finds there's little demand for his services.
   Nelson, 40, an Indianapolis native who grew up in California and
returned here after a hitch in the Army, was a well-respected
detective in September 1987, when an isolated complaint of grave
tampering began a quiet obsession.
   The headstones of a small family plot had been turned over and
desecrated in a wooded, secluded area of Hendricks County. A man
who lived nearby, after overhearing a barroom conversation, had
gone out to see for himself.
   ``He was in tears, he could hardly talk, he was alleging it was
devil worshipers,'' Nelson said in an interview in the office he
converted from his home's family room.
   Rumors of satanism had permeated the county for years. Nelson,
in his only previous brush with the occult, had been on patrol once
in the area when he came across what he believed was a circle of
devil worshipers. That experience had left him shaken.
   News of the grave descration prompted others to come forward
with similar stories, and Nelson soon had 15 graves that had been
disturbed at seven sites over a year and a half. There also were
ghoulish details such as reports of red-robed cultists gathering
near the home of a convicted murderess and an alleged attack on a
motorist by a hooded man with a spiked glove.
   As circumstance would have it, it also was Halloween season. By
January, Nelson and his ``Twilight Zone'' beat had attracted
national publicity.
   It was heady stuff for Nelson, but it was becoming a headache
for local officials concerned about the image of their suburban
community. The detective, meanwhile, was coming up with ``a ton of
leads'' but making little headway in the case.
   ``Effective immediately,'' began the letter from Sheriff Waddell
on Jan. 1988, ``you will discontinue any investigation of the
reported disturbances of graves and the gathering of intelligence
pertaining to satanic cults.''
   By Feb. 15, Nelson was transferred to uniformed patrol.
   ``I was taken back. I was speechless,'' Nelson said. But he
pursued the investigation on his own time until he was reminded he
still represented the department and should cease and desist. He
ceased being a Hendricks County deputy on May 26.
   ``If the sheriff had his way, you never would have heard about
it,'' Nelson says. ``It's hard for people to believe it does exist.
   ``I think it's more important for the people to know about this
and to know how to deal with this than to keep it covered up.''
   In Nelson's office, amid the law enforcement plaques and
certificates, the volumes devoted to ``Understanding Human
Behavior'' and his third wife's collection of owl figurines, he
reserves a corner for occult memorabilia: voodoo dolls, pentagrams,
record albums by heavy metal bands such as Motley Crue and
Megadeth, and confiscated notebooks in which devilish rites are
detailed.
   Satanists are guilty of not only grave robbery but also arson,
rape, kidnapping, brainwashing and even child sacrifice, Nelson
says. He compares the public apathy to the light regard for the
drug culture in the 1950s. ``Look at us now,'' he says.
   ``The whole criminal justice system is inept when it comes to
these kinds of allegations,'' he says.
   ``We've got to get people to believe. People believe it occurs
only in television and movies, but it doesn't. It's out there. It's
sucking up adolescents left and right.''
   Dale Griffis of Tiffin, Ohio, a former police detective and now
a widely respected consultant on such matters, agrees with Nelson.
   `There's a lot of catch-up ball being played now'' by law
enforcement officials and mental health professionals, Griffis says.
   Nelson as a private detective, however, hasn't been able to
attract much business. He said he sometimes regrets leaving the
sheriff's department, and has inquired about joining other police
agencies, but his age is working against him. And he won't give up
trying to expose satanists.
   Nelson shares what he's learned in lectures and police seminars,
but receives little compensation for it other than his expenses.
He's writing a book, but confesses he needs help organizing it and
doesn't have a publisher lined up.
   His last occult-related case was in December, when he was hired
to help in a civil suit a Michigan woman was pursuing to help her
daughter and grandchild, whom the woman thought faced a threat of
child sacrifice, Nelson says.
   He takes on non-occult work as well, but there isn't enough to
put food on the table. That's up to his wife, Phyllis, who directs
security at a local auto plant.
   ``If my wife didn't have a good job we'd be starving,'' he says.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Summer was spoiled for thousands of beachgoers
last year when medical wastes such as syringes and blood vials
washed ashore on the Eastern Seaboard from Massachusetts to
Maryland. Though officials now doubt that hospitals were the
culprits, the Environmental Protection Agency has established
stringent new rules for disposal of trash from health facilities.

   After paying big bucks to rent a house on
Long Beach Island last summer, Kathleen McKeand wasn't about to
stay away from the beach simply because of the scare about medical
waste washing up on shore.
   But the Bayonne Hospital executive remembers how anxious she
felt watching her 1-year-old niece dig in the sand.
   ``We went to the beach, but still you were extremely careful,''
she recalls. ``You look upon digging in the sand as almost a
birthright for a child, and yet you would very carefully examine
where the baby was digging. I found myself being almost paranoid
about it.''
   She wasn't alone.
   The specter of medical waste wash-ups cast a long shadow over
the summer of 1988, closing choice beaches on the Jersey shore and
New York's Long Island, and creating worries even for beach-goers
like McKeand who never confronted a ``CLOSED'' sign on their
favorite stretch of sand.
   Now, with a new beach season fast approaching, government
officials are hoping to prevent a repeat of the nightmares of 1988
with new rules on how hospitals dispose of their used needles,
blood bags and other potentially infectious waste.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is working to put in
place by the first day of summer a new pilot medical waste tracking
program for New Jersey, Connecticut, New York and seven other
states that border the Great Lakes. Even at that, the agency
cautions that its new rules ``may not significantly reduce the
amount of medical waste deposited on beaches.''
   Federal officials doubt that the medical trash that made the
headlines _ including more than 100 bloody vials found on the
shoreline behind Bayonne High School here last July _ came from
hospitals or other medical facilities covered by the new tracking
system.
   ``Let's not delude ourselves into thinking that this program is
going to instantaneously capture all medical waste,'' says Dr. John
Moore, deputy EPA administrator and chairman of an agency task
force on medical waste.
   The federal tracking program will cover hospitals and other
facilities that generate 50 pounds or more per month of medical
waste. Doctors, dentists and clinics that generate lesser amounts
will have to weigh and log their medical wastes, but not fill out
the cradle-to-grave tracking forms.
   None of this tracking or log-keeping will capture any of the
syringes that the nation's diabetics use at home and throw out in
the trash, or the needles that drug addicts use in the streets and
discard down sewer grates.
   ``If you think of a couple of million people a day, in the
privacy of their home, using a needle or syringe for medical
purposes, that's a lot of needles,'' Moore says. ``Let's not delude
ourselves into assuming that none of this stuff is going to find
its way on some beach, somewhere, sometime.''
   Experts say medical waste is part of a broader problem of
floating garbage that sullies all American shores.
   ``We treat medical waste no better or no worse than we treat any
other kind of solid waste,'' says Tom Super, a special assistant to
Moore.
   But AIDS has heightened the public's concern about the safe
disposal of blood, needles and the tons of other potentially
hazardous trash produced in abundance at health care facilities.
   The EPA says that 3.2 million tons of the 160 million tons of
solid waste generated each year in the United States is hospital
medical waste.
   But only 10 percent to 15 percent of that 3.2 million tons is
regarded as potentially infectious. Into this category fall human
blood and blood products, used needles and scalpels, pathological
wastes from surgery and autopsies, cultures and stocks of
infectious agents and contaminated animal carcasses from research
labs.
   Most hospitals have in-house incinerators to burn such waste,
rendering it harmless. The EPA estimates that 70 percent of
hospital waste is incinerated in-house, 15 percent is sterilized in
autoclaves and 15 percent is transported off-site for incineration
or burial.
   Apart from public repugnance at the sight of needles or bloody
vials on a beach, the EPA says, ``Several studies have shown that
medical waste is generally less virulent than typical domestic
waste.''
   ``Public health officials, including the Centers for Disease
Control, believe the risk of contracting such diseases as AIDS from
exposure to these wastes is very low,'' the agency says. Those most
at risk are the medical personnel and sanitation workers who must
handle these wastes on the job.
   Dr. James H. Sammons, executive vice president of the American
Medical Association, cautioned the EPA in a recent letter against
defining ``medical waste'' too broadly. He said ``soiled diapers''
were more of a threat than most of the trash that hospitals and
doctors produce.

   Dirty diapers are full of bacteria, says the EPA's Moore, but
``there's no evidence that suggests you need a special tracking
system for disposable diapers.''
   Moore says the EPA tried to define medical waste narrowly enough
``to capture the stuff that's worthy of capture because of
infectious potential or the potential for physical harm, but not
capture the disposable pillowcase that just happens to be on a
hospital bed used by a heart attack patient.''
   Some lawmakers have accused the EPA of casting too small a net.
In a letter to the head of the EPA, 19 members of Congress charged
that the agency had exempted too much medical waste from its
tracking system.
   ``There is a real threat that the same offensive and potentially
dangerous medical trash will once again wash up on our beaches
because EPA has issued this sweeping exemption,'' said the group
led by Rep. James Florio, D-N.J.
   Florio says that under the EPA plan, bedpans, sponges, bandages
and sutures will not be subject to the tracking system unless they
are soaked with blood.
   The EPA estimates it will cost health care providers and
facilities in the 10 demonstration states $55 million a year to
comply with its tracking and reporting requirements. Average costs
range from $3,757 per year for hospitals to $71 for dentists.
   Bayonne Hospital and other hospitals in New Jersey have been
operating under a waste tracking system the state instituted last
fall. And even before that, concern about AIDS and other
blood-borne diseases had prompted changes in the handling of
patients' blood and used needles.
   ``We use precautions now for all patients,'' says Thomas
Pontoriero, the hospital's director of environmental services.
   That led to the installation of new, locked containers on the
wall of each patient room where nurses deposit needles immediately
after they are used. The sealed containers are picked up and
dropped in a special cage before being emptied and the contents
incinerated.
   Likewise, there are now special white baskets with red liners in
each room for other medical waste bound for the incinerator. And
even the linen baskets in the hallways now have a special vinyl
liner to keep blood from seeping through.
   Bayonne, a prosperous, 299-bed community hospital that
celebrated its centennial last year, is also hiring an extra
sanitation worker to deal exclusively with the medical waste,
including weighing and logging it before incineration.
   ``In restrospect,'' Pontoriero says, ``we have always followed
precaution procedures. Most hospitals have handled it properly. But
it's good to have a formal protocol to follow in handling this
stuff. It's better to be safe than sorry.''
   The hospital's incinerator broke down last July and was out of
operation for nearly four months. Pontoriero spent $24,000 having a
waste disposal company cart the medical waste off twice a week for
eventual incineration in South Carolina.
   The disposal company, Eastern Chemical Waste Systems, ``had a
foolproof manifest system,'' Pontoriero says. ``We had their
documentation, signed by them, about the number of boxes that went
out and the total weight. Fifteen days after they picked it up, we
received a copy back signed by the outfit in South Carolina that
was burning this stuff for us.''
   The federal pilot program will rely on similar logs that both
the health facilities and transporters will fill out. If a hospital
fails to get a signed receipt back from the waste destination point
in 45 days, it must notify both the EPA and the state. Violators
can be fined up to $50,000 per day and sent to jail for up to five
years.
   It was just after the hospital incinerator broke down that some
teen-agers walking on the shoreline behind Bayonne High School
found the first blood vials.
   It was just a coincidence, but it caused a few anxious moments
for Pontoriero and Kathleen McKeand, the hospital's director of
marketing and public relations.
   ``We knew what Eastern Chemical's credentials were,'' McKeand
says. ``But once it's out of our hands, it's not like we ride
shotgun on their trucks to make sure it is going to South
Carolina.''
   The medical trash on Bayonne's shoreline was never traced to the
source.
   But the EPA's Super said that the evidence points to
individuals, not facilities, as being responsible for the bulk of
the medical waste that washed up on beaches from Maryland to
Massachusetts last year.
   ``One of the great myths of this past summer was that the
facilities were somehow midnight dumping their waste,'' he says.

   Garbed in bright orange jumpsuits,
oversized yellow galoshes, rubber gloves up to their elbows and
powder-blue hard hats, prisoners from New Jersey's Mountain View
Prison were out scouring the Newark Bay shorefront on a recent
morning.
   Under the watchful eye of guards and environmental officials,
the 40 prisoners picked up the driftwood and debris that clung to
the shoreline like grime on a seldom-scrubbed tub.
   Most of what they gathered was garden-variety trash: soda
bottles, beer cans, Styrofoam cups, detergent containers, potato
chip wrappers and the other detritus of a disposable society.
   There were none of the syringes, bandages or bloody vials that
made swimming a risky business at more inviting stretches of the
Jersey shore last summer.
   ``No needles today,'' said Joseph Williams, 24, of nearby Jersey
City, serving a nine-month term for drug possession. ``I hope they
are gone. I hope it's going to be different this summer. A lot of
people didn't get to go anywhere last summer.''
   Bill Honachefsky, a New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection official leading the ``Operation Clean Shores'' project,
said, ``Some of this material has been here for 75 years. We're not
going to cure it in one year. But this is going to make a
difference.''
   Part of the Jersey shore's trash floats out of New York City's
waters from sewers that overflow whenever there is a heavy rain.
   In Bayonne, at the bottom end of a peninsula that nearly butts
up against Staten Island, citizens blame the Fresh Kills Landfill
on Staten Island, where they say the trash routinely spills out of
barges.
   In addition, overflows from sewage treatment plants and ocean
dumping all combine to add to the solids called ``floatables'' in
the waters around New York. Some inevitably finds its way to New
Jersey's 127 miles of oceanfront, particularly during full moons or
after storms when tides run high.
   To stem the floatables, state and federal officials are planning
a more aggressive effort to catch the trash before it washes up
anywhere. Three Army Corps of Engineers vessels that normally
patrol for driftwood around New York will be equipped with
small-mesh nets to pick up garbage.

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Doctors disagree on whether kids should be put
on low-fat diets like their mommies and daddies. Many cardiologists

will lead to malnutrition.

   Should kids catch cholesterol phobia?
   Certainly it's going around. For lots of grown-ups, sausage is
sin. Bacon is verboten. A juicy steak is dietary blasphemy.
   Americans are concerned _ not to say obsessed _ over what they
eat. And the belief has taken root that youngsters should watch
their diets, too.
   It makes sense: Heart disease starts early. The man who dies of
a heart attack at 65 is the victim of an illness that probably
began in nursery school.
   Many doctors believe they can forestall this insidious
destruction by starting people on healthy diets in childhood. While
they caution that infants need lots of fat to grow quickly, these
experts argue that after age 2, everybody should follow a
``prudent'' diet.
   Definitions vary, but in general this means that 30 percent or
less of the day's calories should come from fat, and only a third
of the fat should be the saturated variety.
   People get heart disease because they inherit the wrong genes.
They can improve their chances of surviving, and perhaps avoid the
disease completely, if they eat right. Too much saturated fat in
the diet dangerously raises their cholesterol levels. Over a
lifetime, this clogs the heart's plumbing and eventually stops it
up entirely.
   Almost everyone agrees that a prudent diet is good, or at least
harmless, for adults. Even if people have good heart genes, it will
help them keep off weight and maybe give them an edge against some
kinds of cancer.
   But when it comes to children, the consensus ends. In general,
the disagreement pits heart doctors against kids' doctors. Many
cardiologists believe that everyone should cut down on fat after
infancy. However, some pediatricians worry that low-fat diets for
children will lead to malnutrition.
   ``It's a matter of emphasis,'' says Dr. Laurence Finberg, a
pediatrician at the State University of New York in Brooklyn.
``Pediatricians have a concern about adequate growth. Cardiologists
come from the adult sector, and they see it a little differently.''
   Kids need lots of calories to grow. Fat is nature's richest
source of calories. Pound for pound, fat contains twice as many
calories as carbohydrates.
   Pediatricians argue that if kids cut out high-fat food, such as
whole milk and ordinary hamburgers, they will need to eat a lot
more vegetables and other food to get enough calories.
   While eating a low-fat diet with adequate calories is certainly
possible, Dr. Marc S. Jacobson warns that parents sometimes go
overboard. Even nutritionists have trouble figuring the precise
percentage of fat in the diet. Parents sometimes overshoot and cut
their youngster's fat levels back to 20 percent or 25 percent of
calories.
   As a result, the children may not get enough energy, especially
if they are picky eaters, and their growth will be stunted.
   ``I tell parents not to change thier children's diet,'' says
Jacobson, a pediatrician at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in
New Hyde Park, N.Y. ``If they don't have a family risk of heart
disease, then I don't think we should be doing anything at this
point in time.''
   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children get
30 percent to 40 percent of their calories from fat, which is
essentially what they are already eating. A federal survey found
that American children get between 34 percent and 39 percent from
fat.
   Pediatrians and cardiologists agree that children with a family
history of heart disease should have their cholesterol checked. And
they should go on diets if their cholesterol levels are high. But
pediatricians generally balk at rigorously squeezing the fat out of
every youngster's diet.
   ``I think run-of-the-mill parents should be aware that a
high-fat diet is not good and should avoid a high-fat diet,'' says
Finberg, who is chairman of the academy's nutrition committee.
``You don't need to say it any more stringently than that.''
   To back up their concern, some pediatricians cite the studies of
Dr. Fima Lifshitz of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset,
N.Y. Three years ago, he reported the cases of seven children who
failed to grow adequately because their parents had put them on
diets. The parents were worried about heart disease and obesity.
   Despite such reports, many cardiologists believe the chances are
remote that youngsters won't get enough to eat, especially enough
fat. On the other hand, the dangers of too much cholesterol in the
blood are clear.
   These doctors would like to see children's cholesterol levels
drop from the present level of 160 milligrams per deciliter of
blood to 140 or lower. That means that by the time they reach
adulthood, their cholesterol will still average below 200, which is
generally considered to be a healthy level.
   ``We believe that the ideal level of cholesterol in the blood
would be between 110 and 140 for children,'' says Dr. Curtis
Ellison, a cardiologist at Boston University Medical School. ``If
we could achieve that, we could put every cardiologist out of
business 20 years from now.''
   Probably the leading advocate of the prudent diet for children
is the American Heart Association. Dr. Frank A. Franklin of
Louisiana State University, a member of the association's nutrition
committee, says children can easily cut their fat to a healthy
level without making radical changes or sacrificing calories.
   The rules are simple, he says Stick with 1 percent milk, choose
lean meat and low-fat cheese, and buy snacks and desserts that
don't contain lard or tropical oils.
   ``We are not talking about ripping cookies out of children's
hands and putting a cucumber there,'' Franklin says. ``We are being
painted as puritans, as though we are trying to restructure
American life through diet. We are only trying to make people live
longer.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ If it's pleasing to the nose, there's probably a
market for it. That's the philosophy of aroma researchers at a New
Jersey company whose customers range from soap manufacturers to the
makers of fine perfumes. They even formulated a ``dinosaur
vegetation'' fragrance for the Philadelphia Zoo.

   A honey bee would likely have a nervous
breakdown if trapped inside a New Jersey fragrance factory where
scientists are constantly in search of new scents to sell.
   An overwhelming odor fills the plant of International Flavors
and Fragrances. It is the mingled essence of hundreds of
concentrated odors released into the air when workers open
canisters filled with rare ingredients that are blended to create a
desired smell.
   Sweet orange and rare rose oils compete with spicy vanilla and
cinnamon. A lovely lavender scent tangles in the air with the
woodsy odor of moss.
   IFF scientists have devised scents for detergent companies that
ask for something ``fresh'' or ``clean.'' They put the smell in
products that range from household air fresheners to expensive
perfumes.
   IFF researchers also have faced some unusual challenges, says
companmy spokesman William G. Dalton. When the Philadelphia Zoo
wanted to let children experience all their senses in its new
``Treehouse'' exhibit, IFF devised a ``dinosaur vegetation''
fragrance.
   When the owner of a shopping mall bakery was overwhelmed by the
omnipresent odor of a pizza shop next door, ``he needed sensory
competition,'' Dalton says. ``We developed a smell for fresh-baked
goods, and it worked.''
   In 1988, IFF, which employs 4,800 people in 36 countries,
reported net sales of $839.5 million and a net income of $128.7
million. The company touts itself as the ``ghostwriter'' to its
clients, refusing to identify any of the famous brands of
fragrances the company has developed.
   Not everyone is impressed with the smells, though.
Environmentalists and local residents have complained about noxious
odors and discharges into the Raritan Bay, prompting state
environmental officials to impose fines.
   At times, those fines have been stiff, including a $1.25 million
penalty in October 1986 for groundwater pollution. In view of the
problems, the company is modifying its monitoring equipment as the
facility continues to grow.
   The business of fragrance boomed when federal health officials
banned the use of an anti-bacterial ingredient in soaps that killed
odor-causing bacteria, Dalton says.
   ``Fragrance was the natural substitute,'' Dalton says.
   But the fascination with fragrance is hardly a new phenomenon.
In February, archaeologists dug up a 2,000-year-old flask of oil
that might have been used to anoint ancient Israelite kings.
   Today, scents are found in advertising strips between the pages
of magazines, in most every brand of shampoo and even in plastic
toys.
   ``We have not seen any indication that there is too much
fragrance on the market,'' Dalton says. ``People get excited by new
fragrances. As long as it's pleasing, it's acceptable.''
   To get public reaction to a newly developed scent, IFF hires
local residents ``to smell a variety of different things in a
variety of ways, whether on skin or cloth or whatever,'' says Ira
Katz, director of research and development. ``We're not necessarily
interested in whether they personally like it, but whether it
covers a malodor, such as body odor or kitchen odor.''
   Testers in cubicles _ mostly women _ take quick sniffs from
small jars, then record the overall intensity of each. In some
instances, the testers have sniffed forearms, smelled dank laundry
or even hovered over a row of smelly garbage cans.
   In IFF's compounding facility next door, employees look like
chefs as they mix oils, crystals and other liquids in
stainless-steel buckets and tanks to produce concentrates of
various fragrances. The ``recipes'' are top-secret and divided up
among several employees to protect the secrecy of a customer's
formula, says Ted Trembley, general manager of the IFF compounding
facility.
   The fragrance compounds are then shipped to a customer's own
plant, where they are mixed with other ingredients to create the
completed product.
   The raw ingredients used to produce an individual fragrance vary
in their rarity. Bulgarian ``rose otto,'' for instance, is perhaps
the most expensive _ it takes one ton of rose petals to make about
two pounds of the intensely strong-smelling oil worth more than
$5,000, Trembley says.
   The high cost of natural ingredients such as sandalwood and
exotic flowers has led IFF researchers to devise methods of
artificially reproducing scents.
   The scientists also have devised a method to capture a scent in
its natural state _ the most desirable intensity, Trembley says.
   ``A fresh flower does not have the same molecular structure
after it is cut,'' he says.
   To duplicate those exact scents, scientists use a portable
mechanism that can be taken anywhere, from the tiny greenhouse on
the roof of IFF headquarters to a large field of flowers in Europe.
   The method involves placing a small glass globe over a flower
and using a simple pump to draw the air around the blossom into a
small tube, says Robert Trenkle, a senior project chemist.
   An absorbent material in the tube captures the ``aroma
molecules,'' and the material is then analyzed with a spectrometer
to determine its primary components.
   ``The trickiest part is putting all the components back together
and coming up with the same scent,'' Trenkle says.
   A flower's scent, he says, is an ``elaborate mixture of
chemicals being emitted...usually to attract an insect. A flower's
odor is not for us to enjoy. It's for a much more important
reason.''
   In the past decade, IFF has concentrated on capturing thousands
of fragrance ``notes'' and reproducing them for the benefit of the
human nose, Dalton says. Some fine perfumes, he says, may be
combined from 1,500 ingredients.
   ``Our perfumers are very creative people,'' he says. ``They are
actually artists starting with a blank canvas, developing a
fragrance from zero.''
   Despite the technological advances made in creating new scents
and synthetically reproducing scents, Dalton acknowledges that one
part of IFF's scientific and creative process will probably never
be duplicated.
   ``We can test our products only with the human nose,'' he says.
``And even then, it's still very subjective.''

   Ray Charles meet Charles Wadsworth, Charles
Wadsworth meet Ray Charles. That may be the scenario one Friday
night in May when these two accomplished pianists meet backstage at
the New York City Ballet.
   It is a bit of stage irony that these two remarkable musicians
were both born in Georgia about a year apart, both trod the boards
for 40 years or more fashioning stellar careers, and yet their
paths never crossed. Until now.
   In the same week in May, Ray Charles and Charles Wadsworth will
be featured in ``Live from Lincoln Center'' broadcasts on PBS,
playing two separate programs of music in their separate,
inimitable styles.
   Ray Charles, at home in Los Angeles, plans to turn on TV today
(May 7), at 5 p.m. (EDT) for a two-hour concert by the Chamber
Music Society of Lincoln Center. Charles Wadsworth will play and
make a speech ``summing up 20 years of incredibly intense, hard,
much-loved work.''
   Wadsworth has been artistic director of the society since its
beginning and has seen it grow from 16 concerts a season to 90. He
decided to retire at the end of this season, when the society was
20 and he would be turning 60.
   Wadsworth plans to take his wife to a birthday dinner next
Friday, and then to the New York State Theater to see three ballets
by the New York City Ballet. The middle, 50-minute one, at 9 p.m.
(EDT), will be televised. It will have Ray Charles on stage with
the dancers, playing piano and singing his songs. ``A Fool for
You,'' a 1955 Ray Charles composition, is also the title of the
ballet.
   Then Charles Wadsworth may go backstage to meet Ray Charles.
   Ray Charles, who was born in Albany, Ga., on Sept. 23, 1930,
studied classical music at the State School for the Blind in St.
Augustine, Ga., long before he became famous for his exhilarating
combination of secularized gospel, blues and pop music.
   Charles Wadsworth, born in Newman, Ga., on May 21, 1929, was
first primarily a piano accompanist. He has been working in
classical chamber music since Gian Carlo Menotti had him set up
daily chamber concerts at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1960.
   Wadsworth has written some pop ballads and intends to use time
afforded by retirement to write some more, as well as play the
piano more often and possibly do something on cable TV.
   For the ballet, Ray Charles says, ``Choreographer Peter Martins
was the cat who picked some of my early recordings. I had to go
back and learn the songs the way I did them at that time. They took
the records and that's what they learned the steps to. I play some
of those songs today but I play them so different.''
   Charles was happy with the songs that were chosen. ``I've been
very fortunate in my recording career,'' he says. ``I never was put
in a position to record anything I didn't like. Record companies
always said, `Hey, man, whatever you record, you record.'''
   The first performance of ``A Fool for You'' was last spring,
during the New York City Ballet's American Music Festival. Charles,
who never had provided a live ballet score before, didn't get
carried away and stretch out on any of the numbers. ``I'm not going
to do something to goof them up,'' he says.
   On stage with him on Friday, as they were for last year's
premiere, will be his backup singers, the Raeletts, and most of the
members of his first band. ``They wanted it as close to the same
sound as possible,'' he says. ``I went out and found the cats. They
all have their own things going now. They come in and do this just
for me, which I think is sweet.''
   Today's chamber music concert will include Poulenc's ``Sextet
for Piano and Winds,'' one of pianist Wadsworth's favorites. ``I've
been playing that 30 years now,'' he says. ``It's a very cheerful,
sensuous, warm piece. It seemed the ideal thing for me to play in
this final concert.''
   Asked what he considers the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln
Center's greatest achievement, Wadsworth replies, ``I think it has
been to focus people all around the country on the incredible
wealth of chamber music repertoire and the excitement that can be
generated by having the very greatest virtuoso artists perform this
music together.
   ``There are so many more chamber music events around the country
than we ever dreamed would be happening when we started this
thing.''
   Of the two, Ray Charles was first on television, in Seattle in
1948. ``My trio had this 15-minute radio show every week,'' he
recalls. ``They came in and filmed part of it. We didn't do
anything great on it but I was playing my music and getting it
exposed. I was extremely excited; I was beside myself. TV wasn't
big then. Bars had one TV and people would meet up there and
watch.''
   These days, Charles turns down more TV than he accepts. He
prefers to tour with a band and the Raeletts and to perform with
orchestras in symphonic arrangements of his music.
   Thinking about hearing Charles perform for ballet, Wadsworth
says, ``I've always had the greatest admiration for my fellow
Georgian. I can't wait.''
   On the other side, Charles says that he likes chamber music
``when it is played right. I have to tell you I like any kind of
music I can sit down and listen to and it makes sense.''

   Veteran producer Roger L. Stevens says Broadway
is suffering from a severe shortage of good writers.
   ``The good writers have gotten old and died, and television gets
the young ones before they develop their craft,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ``There was a time in the 1950s when there might
be 25 first-rate scripts floating about at any one time. Not any
mlay in Paris, cast Mikhail Baryshnikov in the
lead role. The play has broken the house record at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater.
   ``It couldn't miss,'' Stevens says. ``Here is one of the most
famous short stories of all time by one of the most famous authors
of all time, plus a superstar, all in one package.''
   ``Metamorphosis'' and A.R. Gurney's hit ``The Cocktail Hour,''
now playing off-Broadway, are Stevens' first New York shows since
he retired last year as chairman of the board at the John F.
Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. ``I spent the
last three years trying to give the position to somebody,'' he
quips.
   For 17 years, he headed the behemoth cultural institution which
was originally proposed by President Kennedy in 1961 as the
National Cultural Center.
   In the beginning, many in Congress were against the Cultural
Center, later named after the late president, but Stevens
persisted. He went from congressman to congressman to gain support
for the project. Even after the gleaming white marble structure
opened in the early '70s, he had to battle for money.
   ``We were always so broke,'' Stevens recalls. ``We never got any
government money for productions.''
   It was the center's involvement in such musicals as ``Pippin''
and ``Annie'' that brought in money, plus Stevens' never-flagging
efforts to raise cash from private and corporate donors.
   Stevens remains on the center's board of trustees and he hasn't
given up his other cultural jobs. Among his other duties are the
chairmanship of the National Book Awards, membership on the
President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities and founding
father of the Fund for New American Plays.
   Before Stevens entered the theater, he had been a successful
real estate man. He headed a syndicate that bought and sold the
Empire State Building in the early 1950s and he also has extensive
real estate holdings in Seattle.
   ``I never wanted to be a producer,'' Stevens says. ``I just
wanted to get away from the real estate business.''
   His first big commercial production, a musical version of
``Peter Pan'' starring Jean Arthur and Boris Karloff in 1950, was a
hit, and he was hooked.
   ``If you have one big successful musical, you are set for
life,'' Stevens says.
   Stevens' bonanza was ``West Side Story'' but, he recalls, the
initial response from investors was minimal.
   ``I had to guarantee the money for the production on my own,''
he says. ``I always knew it was going to be a hit, although nobody
else thought so. I just thought, `How can we go wrong?' We had
`Romeo and Juliet' plus Jerry Robbins doing the dances.''
   Still, he has had his share of failures. Who remembers such
flops as ``Midgie Purvis,'' ``Blood, Sweat and Stanley Poole,''
``Everybody Loves Opal'' and a lot of others?
   ``I expect them,'' Stevens says. ``It's the law of averages.
Today, if one out of seven or eight works, you're doing well.''
   His efforts to form what amounted to a national theater company
at the Kennedy Center under director Peter Sellars met with a lot
of publicity but little success.
   ``I don't think he had enough experience, especially in theater
itself,'' Stevens says. ``Peter was very good with operas, but
Washington just didn't seem to take to him. It was quite a surprise
to him when it didn't work.''
   Where does Stevens look for new shows?
   ``If you've been in the business as long as I have, you know
where all the authors are and what they're doing,'' he says. ``But
plays don't just come in to you like they used to. There are very
few available plays that don't tell the same old story. You just
have to keep looking.''

<HEAD>CONTINENT IN CRISIS: South American Debt _ Eating at the Masses</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1970s, banks overflowed with money to
lend and South Americans were ready to borrow it. Today the South
Americans struggle just to pay the interest on the loans, let alone
the principal. Foreign debt is emptying South America's pocketbook.
This is another in a series of periodic reports by The Associated
Press on the economic, social and political turbulence that has
turned South America into a continent in crisis.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>By LISA GENASCI</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Across South America, the crushing burden of foreign debt piled
up largely by military governments no longer in power is stifling
economies, stirring unrest in the masses and threatening fragile
democracies.
   Some leaders see the crisis as an opening for radical populists
with radical solutions _ debt moratoriums or outright repudiation
of debt, for example _ and, in turn, the possibility of military
rule once more.
   Foreign debt is likely to be a major issue in presidential
elections this year Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia and
Uruguay.
   Compounding the debt problem, however, are factors that have
pervaded South American nations long before they went on a
borrowing binge _ mismanagement, corruption, and accumulations of
vast wealth in cities while hand-to-mouth poverty and illiteracy
persisted in the countryside.
   Colombia and Peru face the additional burdens of guerrilla wars
and the illegal cocaine trade.
   Ten South American nations owe a total of $277.4 billion,
according to compilations of the Economic Commission for Latin
America, and repayments are taking a heavy toll on their economies
and the livelihood of their peoples:
   _ Five years ago Brazilians could buy a cookstove for what it
costs them now to buy a kilo of black beans; inflation has soared
to 1,000 percent yearly and the cruzado currency has been devalued
by a factor of 1 million.
   _ In Colombia, Peru and Bolivia efforts to cope with mounting
debts have opened the way to a $10-billion cocaine trade that feeds
the starved economies with hard currency and provides jobs for the
unemployed. Drug money threatens to erode accepted economic and
political systems.
   _ In Argentina, once one of the world's wealthiest nations, the
$80 billion gross domestic product has stagnated for a decade and
the value of the austral currency steadily declines.
   _ In Venezuela where oil once brought wealth, poverty is rising
fast: a survey of 2.3 million families in 1981 by the Latin
American Institute of Social Research showed 22 percent were poor;
its survey of more than 3 million in 1987 showed the rate had risen
to 54 percent. Three days of rioting over price increases in late
February and early March left 276 people dead and more than 1,000
injured and conditions remain tense.
   ``The riots were the result of a crisis that can be written in
capital letters _ the foreign debt,'' said Carlos Andres Perez,
Venezuela's president.
   ``A debt paid with misery is a bill that will eventually be paid
with democracy,'' said President Jose Sarney of Brazil, which has
the highest of the Third World's foreign debt, $115 billion.
   ``Democracy is losing ground in Latin America because the
solutions it has presented do not attend national problems. We
offer pessimistic solutions, and the parties of the left optimistic
ones.''
   Said Argentina's President Raul Alfonsin: ``The misery, the
depressing conditions of life, the lack of food, housing, health,
training, education, and jobs create a culture dish that can be
exploited by `ultras' and extremists of whatever tendency.''
   Foreign debt has become increasingly politicized on the
continent.
   It is a top issue in the election campaigns in Brazil and
Argentina, where leftist or populist candidates are front-runners.
   They began entering the picture as governments cut wages and
subsidies on basic goods and services to meet creditor demands for
economic austerity. The cuts resulted in sharply reduced living
standards on top of stalled economic growth.
   A plan announced in March by U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady acknowledges for the first time that the Third World's debt
may not be payable.
   Though still sketchy, Brady's proposal to eliminate 20 percent
of debt marks a distinct turn from the Reagan administration's
policy of piling new loans on old.
   Banks, too, now recognize that only debt relief will avoid
explosive social unrest and guarantee at least partial payment.
   ``Voluntary debt reduction is a necessary part of any future
debt strategy,'' said William Rhodes, head of the Citicorp
debt-restructuring committee.
   Most South American governments have long cried for creditors to
share responsibility for the lending bonanza of the 1970s, when
most of their debt was accrued by military governments without
popular mandates.
   They argue that banks, flush with petrodollars from the 1973 oil
crisis, were looking for ways to invest. Latin American nations,
which were posting 4 to 5 percent growth rates and hadn't defaulted
on a debt since the 1930s, seemed a good prospect.
   But many experts now say the banks took undue risks, failing to
verify how the money was spent and ignoring repayment
possibilities. Money was lent at floating interest rates, which in
the 1970s were at a low of 1 percent.
   Though much of the borrowed money was used for important
development projects such as roads, airports and hydroelectric
dams, much more was wasted.
   The Brazilian military government spent an estimated $20 billion
on a program to build 10 nuclear plants by 1980. But only one has
been built _ a plant nicknamed ``lightening bug'' because it shuts
down so often _ and parts for three others rust in warehouses.

   In Argentina, the military regime used the loans to buy weapons
and help finance the 1978 World Cup soccer championship. In Chile,
the military paid import bills.
   Still more money went to pad foreign bank accounts of corrupt
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen. Estimates are that $15
billion of Brazil's $115 billion debt, $20 billion of Argentina's
$56 billion debt and $22 billion of Venezuela's $32 billion went
into private accounts abroad.
   Lending didn't reach a standstill until 1982, when Mexico
announced it did not have the money to meet a monthly payment. The
announcement sent shivers through financial circles abroad and talk
arose of a world economic crisis.
   U.S. banks were the most exposed, with $72 billion in Latin
loans. As much as 20 percent of Citicorp profits and 25 percent of
other bank revenues were from loans to Brazil alone.
   Some experts now say if banks were to write off at least part of
the debt major financial turmoil could be avoided.
   ``At best it would mean the collapse of one or two New York
banks,'' said Rudigar Dornbusch, an economics professor at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an adviser to debtor
nations.
   Though new money from private banks no longer financed
development projects after 1982, South America's debt almost
doubled as nations rolled over payments in endless accords with
creditors as interest rates soared.
   A Chilean opposition leader, Ricardo Lagos, maintains the debt
was simply ``kicked ahead'' for future governments to pay.
   ``You've got a situation in which the emperor has no clothes,''
Dornbusch said. ``The debt is being shown up for what it really is.
It isn't payable under present terms.''
   In Brazil, economic austerity measures slashed wages by 50
percent in the past five years, while 25 percent of the
economically active population can't find regular jobs. The
government estimates 60 percent of the population struggles by on
the equivalent of less than $80 a month, while the country has
spent $50 billion meeting interest bills since 1984.
   Argentina's annual per capita income dropped to the equivalent
of $1,630 in 1988 from $1,990 in 1980, according to the World Bank.
   In Chile, 38 percent of the 12 million people live below the
poverty line, according to Ernesto Tironi of the Economic
Commission for Latin America.
   In smaller South American nations, the situation is more
dramatic.
   Cocaine earns Colombia more than coffee, its principal export.
Peru and Bolivia earn more from cocaine than from all their
official exports together, according to a U.S. presidential
commission.
   Peru has virtually suspended debt payments by linking capital
outflows to 10 percent of export earnings but still the economy
shrank nearly 9 percent last year. Inflation is projected at 10,000
percent this year and one in every three people doesn't have a
steady job.
   The discontent has fed the election campaigns in Argentina and
Brazil.
   In Argentina, Peronist candidate Carlos Menem hinted he might
impose a five-year moratorium on debt payments if elected on May 14.
   In Brazil, Leonel Brizola of the Democratic Labor Party, a
front-running presidential prospect, has argued for a suspension of
payments on the debt ``contracted in an orgy of lending between the
military government and banks.''
   Another front-runner in Brazil, Luiz Ignacio Lula da Silva of
the Workers Party, says he agrees with Cuba's Fidel Castro: Latin
America should pay no more. Brazilians vote Nov. 15.
   If creditors do not write off part of what is owed ``democracy
will be threatened and leftist alternatives will start looking
attractive to the people,'' says Brazil's President Sarney.
   And that, he adds, could bring on another cycle of military
coups.

   Word of mouth and fliers distributed in
mostly poor, mostly black areas brought Gladys Mae Hinson and a lot
of women like her to the clinic where Dr. Jesse James Howard
delivered babies for $350.
   Ms. Hinson, 23, the youngest of 18, came from Mosses, an
impoverished backwater, to have her second child. Antoinette was
born at 6:55 p.m. on Aug. 20, 1986, and Howard sent mother and baby
home at 7:30 even though Antoinette was having trouble breathing.
Soon her breathing stopped.
   Gladys Mae gave her baby mouth-to-mouth resuscitation during the
30-minute race to a hospital, but lack of oxygen already had taken
its toll. ``She can't walk, she can't talk, she can't take care of
herself.''
   A month later, Howard sent Janice Peterson home 2{ hours after
Willie Jr. was born. Willie began having trouble breathing the next
day. Before he got to the hospital he died of inhaling meconium, or
fetal feces, a normally treatable complication of childbirth.
   Medical Examiner James R. Lauridson believed Willie shouldn't
have died, and asked the State Board of Medical Examiners to
investigate. Right away, said board Director Larry Dixon, six more
doctors urged action against Howard.
   The board investigated 11 of Howard's deliveries over an
18-month period _ including those of Willie, Antoinette, another
baby with brain damage and three others who died _ and asked the
Alabama Medical Licensure Commission to revoke his license. It took
until July 1987 for the commission to suspend Howard's license and
until the following March for revocation.
   ``We should have done something a little sooner, maybe,'' said
Dixon, a state senator. But he said the circumstances _ a black
doctor delivering black babies in an office for poor women who'd
had little prenatal care _ prevented the board and the commission
from moving any faster than they did.
   ``He was dealing with a patient population that has a much
higher infant mortality rate than the rest of the state. We didn't
know at first whether we were dealing with gross malpractice or a
phenomenon of the population.''
   Alabama's 1986 infant mortality rate was 13.3 deaths per 1,000
live births, the worst in the nation; nationally, the rate was
10.4. In 1987, Alabama fell to fourth, with 12.2; complete
nationwide statistics are unavailable.
   Howard, who says he's delivered 2,000 to 2,500 babies, contends
that the white-controlled medical community has been ``on my case''
for years, in part because his deliveries took business away from
hospitals and other doctors. A double standard of care exists in
Alabama, he says: Whites get quality care from well-paid doctors,
while poor blacks get whatever they can.
   Because of that double standard, Howard should be praised for
his work, said his attorney, Robert Turner. ``It's a miracle more
of his patients didn't die. It's a testament to his skill that they
didn't.''
   Howard was ``as much a missionary as a medical doctor,'' J.L.
Chestnut, another of his lawyers, argued in appealing the March 23,
1988, license revocation before Montgomery County Circuit Judge
Joseph Phelps.
   Board officials ``knew we were going to be charged with racial
discrimination when we got into it,'' Dixon said, adding that such
claims have been standard when action is taken against a member of
a minority group.
   The board accused Howard of sending babies home minutes after
problem deliveries; performing risky deliveries in an ill-equipped
office; not keeping newborns warm, leading to cold stress; and
``repeated failure ... to recognize and treat significant and
substantial life-threatening medical conditions.''
   ``The standards of medicine nowadays dictate that if you're
going to provide the care, there's a minimum standard of care
you've got to meet,'' said Dr. Earl Fox, head of the Alabama
Department of Public Health.
   Howard, a 1972 graduate of Meharry College's medical school in
Nashville, Tenn., says he met that standard in deliveries, which
accounted for 10 percent of his practice. ``Many of those babies
had problems from the get-go. I didn't do anything to those
mothers.''
   But Howard has been no stranger to the authorities.
   The board had investigated him before, in 1976, but declined to
take action, citing lack of evidence of alleged irregularities in
his prescription practices. Howard said he also had been
investigated twice for alleged problems with deliveries like those
that cost him his license.
   And in Selma, where Howard set up a clinic in 1973, he lost his
hospital privileges for stabbing Dr. Chudy Okoye during a scuffle
in a ditch; he also was convicted of assault, fined $500 and
sentenced to 30 days in jail, served on weekends. No formal charges
were filed in an earlier scuffle in an operating room where Okoye's
surgery took longer than scheduled.
   Howard also assaulted a woman employee who had been living with
him, and was fined $50 and given a 30-day suspended sentence and
six months' probation. In 1979, he was fined and given a suspended
sentence for petty larceny, and in 1980, he was convicted of
failing to file birth and death certificates. The death certificate
charge was dropped on appeal; Howard was fined $1 after pleading
guilty to the birth certificate charge.
   When Howard moved his clinic to Montgomery in 1985, members of
the area medical community already had seen some of his babies in
emergency rooms.
   ``We'd get a (dead) baby born to a low-income family, and the
first thing we'd ask is `Did it come from Dr. Howard?''' said Ike
Moss, a former investigator with the state's Department of Forensic
Sciences. ``I started hollering, `Let's get his license,' when I
worked the second one.''
   Still, about 100 people showed up at a license hearing in
support of Howard, who is living in Tuscaloosa and awaiting Phelps'
decision.
   ``He was a neighborhood hero,'' said Dr. Thomas C. Nolan, a
member of the licensure commission.
   Sharon Jones, 18, of Fort Deposit, whose daughter died less than
a day after her June 9, 1987, birth, said Howard ``treated me very
nice.''
   ``It's just in God's hands,'' said Sharon's mother, Annie Pearl
Jones. ``I never felt like he killed the baby.''
   Febie Ann Crum's baby suffered brain damage during delivery June
5, 1987. ``He is not really the age he's supposed to be. He has not
got the growth a 2-year-old has supposed to get,'' said her
mother-in-law, Plummie Mae Crum of Greenville. ``He don't do
nothing much.''
   Gladys Mae Hinson describes Antoinette, now 2{, in similar terms.
   ``They say she will always be with me,'' Ms. Hinson said. ``I've
accepted the fact that this child will be with me until I die or
she dies.''
   Ms. Hinson, who had a son before Antoinette and has had a
daughter since, says she can't work because of the constant chance
Antoinette will have a seizure and the numerous dosages of medicine
she has to be given daily.
   She said she now believes Howard was wrong to send her home so
soon after Antoinette was born, particularly since she was in
trouble.
   But ``I trusted him,'' she said. ``He was my doctor.''

<HEAD>Allergy Season's Here As Sniffling And Sneezing Abound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM SHARP</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Researchers are looking for drugs to prevent allergic reactions
from starting but until they succeed, 35 million allergic Americans
will just have to keep fighting the symptoms _ with pills, snorts,
shots and handkerchiefs.
   And despite advances in treatment, spring still can be a
miserable time.
   There currently is ``no way to attack the central souce and make
it go away,'' said Gerald Vanderpool of American Allergy
Consultants in Atlanta. ``So basically you have to deal with it.
There are ways now to keep a patient fairly comfortable. No many
years ago it was a voodoo and witchcraft specialty.''
   An allergic reaction is an overzealous response of the immune
system to an otherwise harmless substance, such as pollen, dust,
penicillin or cat dandruff. The body releases powerful chemicals
that cause those classic symptoms: runny nose, watery eyes, rash
or, in asthma, constriction of the breathing passages.
   Of 35 million allergic Americans, 14.6 million suffer from hay
fever, nearly 9 million have asthma and 11.8 million have eczema,
hives, swelling or an allergic reaction to food, medicine or insect
stings.
   The discovery that lifted allergy treatment from the ``voodoo
and witchcraft'' category was immunoglobulin E, or IgE, an antibody
found in much higher levels in allergic people. Antibodies fight
foreign substances in the body; when IgE cells come into contact
with a foreign substance, they release histamine, a chemical that
causes swelling and itching. The greatest advances in treatment in
recent years have been improved delivery of time-tested drugs.
   A better understanding of the allergic reaction and better
medication are making life more bearable for people with allergies,
said Dr. Allen Kaplan, the chairman of the department of medicine
at State University of New York at Stony Brook and president of the
American Academy of Allergy and Immunology. A prime example is the
use of steroids that can be inhaled to treat asthma.
   ``Previously the most severe asthmatics had to take steroids by
pills. Administering them through inhalation gets a very
concentrated dose into the lungs without significant absorption
into the rest of the circulation,'' Kaplan said. ``Therefore it
minimizes the side effects of steroids and optimizes therapy to the
lungs because you're delivering it directly.''
   Another asthma drug is cromolyn sodium, available as a nasal
spray or eye drop. It works by inhibiting the secretion of mast
cells, which are involved in all allergic reactions. ``In both
these instances we're treating the reaction locally in a reasonably
potent way,'' Kaplan said. ``They really work better than
treatments we've used in the past.''
   Allergy treatments have for years relied on antihistamines,
which combat the chemical responsible for many allergy symptoms.
Kaplan said antihistamines have advanced in two significant ways:
Versions are available that do not cause drowsiness, and
timed-release capsules to be taken just once or twice a day.
   ``There is no question our understanding'' of allergies has
increased tremendously in recent years, Kaplan said. The immediate
allergy symptoms are well known and are the target of most
treatments, but researchers have learned only recently that there
is a delayed, secondary reaction.
   This reaction may occur four to eight hours after the initial
symptoms have died down and the stimulus has been removed, he said.
``It lasts many hours and is dependent on the prior allergic
reaction.''
   People allergic to many things may be displaying almost constant
symptoms because of these secondary reactions, he said.
``Understanding the biochemistry of the late phase reaction is in
its infancy. As we understand it better I would anticipate drugs
coming out that would interfere with it.''
   If the target of an allergy is the lungs, the result is asthma,
which sends 27 million people a year to the doctor and kills 4,000.
It is the leading cause of missed school days, says the American
Academy of Allergy and Immunology.
   ``We used to think of asthma as a brief reaction occurring
shortly after exposure. Now we know it's a prolonged reaction that
may persist for several days,'' said Dr. Phillip Lieberman of
Memphis, Tenn., past president of the academy. ``That has allowed
for more rational treatment programs.''
   The more severe aspects of asthma are the target of clinical
drug tests to fight leukotrienes, a chemical estimated to be
thousands of times more powerful than histamine in causing allergic
inflammation of air passages.
   In hay fever, the main culprit is pollen, the male germ cells of
many plants. The most damaging types of pollen come from trees in
the spring, grass in the summer and ragweed in late summer and
fall. Grass, tree and weed pollens are light and airborne.
Blossoming flowers have heavy, sticky pollen, rely on insects for
reproduction and aren't a problem for allergy sufferers.
   When the pollen count is worst depends on location, but as a
rule tree pollen starts being a problem in the South as early as
February and gradually moves north. In some climates, the tree,
grass and weed seasons may overlap.
   Perhaps the best way to avoid pollen is to take a sea cruise, a
remedy beyond the reach of most people. The American Academy of
Allergy and Immunology lists several other places where one might
wait out the pollen season, but it sounds like a wish list for an
outdoors nut _ the central Adirondacks, wooded areas of Maine, New
Hampshire, northern Minnesota, extreme northern Michigan,
California, and west of the Cascades in Oregon and Washington.
   The desert areas of the Rocky Mountains and Hawaii, Alaska and
the Caribean Islands also are relatively free of ragweed.
   There are less exotic ways to control exposure to allergens:
Stay inside in the early morning, when pollen tends to be worst,
and on windy days. Keep the windows closed and use a filtered air
conditioner. Drive with the car windows shut. Don't mow the grass,
rake leaves or grow many plants indoors.
   Treatments to fight the reaction itself, rather than the
symptoms, also are available, and work on the same principle as any
vaccination. Injections of allergens are given in increasing
dosages, building the body's tolerance.
   This immunotherapy is most effective in people allergic to
pollens, molds, dust and some insect stings.
   The most dangerous allergic reaction is known as anaphylactic
shock, a drastic, sudden reaction to such things as food, drugs and
insect stings that can be fatal. Reaction to food is very
individual, but the foods most often cited for anaphylaxis are
nuts, shellfish, eggs and seeds.
   The Food and Drug Administration estimates there were 37,000
adverse drug reactions in 1985, 2 percent of which were fatal.
   People over 30 are more susceptible to insect stings, which kill
about 50 a year in the United States. Hornets, yellowjackets,
wasps, bees and some species of ants, such as the Southeast's fire
ants, are the worst offenders.

   Carol Loveland wouldn't advise replacing
meat and potatoes with a plate of dirt, but after studying what's
called geophagia she says a mouthful of just the right soil may
sometimes be good for what ails you.
   ``Some soils may contribute minerals ... that can be absorbed,''
said the Utah State University anthropologist, warning, however,
that ``some people can become very anemic'' from eating dirt,
ingesting chemicals that interrupt the body's exchange of nutrients
_ or can be sickened by harmful microbes.
   ``I think the chances of clay-eating doing an individual very
much good are rather slim,'' Loveland concluded.
   Her study, to be published in the June issue of the journal Food
and Foodways, found dirt- and clay-eating throughout history.
``There may have been a point where food was not so much separated
into animal or vegetable; whatever was available in the environment
was edible.''
   In Roman times, Galen _ the 2nd century physician known as the
father of experimental physiology _ acquired 20,000 lozenges of
dirt and goat blood from the Mediterranean island of Lemnos and
dispensed them for various ailments.
   To this day, dirt-eating is practiced in various forms,
motivated by belief in soil's nutritional, medicinal, cultural or
even religious properties.
   ``In Africa, the clay is frequently formed into an egg shape and
sold in the markets,'' Loveland said. ``In India, it's molded into
the shape of a tea cup, left unbaked. Tea is poured into the cup
and the individual drinks the tea and eats the cup.''
   In America's rural South, clay-eating remains a resilient
subculture. While the practice may have been imported by African
slaves, she said, it no longer can be described as limited to
particular social, ethnic or racial groups.
   ``Other people are using clay, too,'' she said, noting that
capsules and tablets of dirt and clay are showing up in health food
stores, touted for their mineral content and as remedies for
certain stomach and intestinal ailments.
   Indeed, clay-eating in the Americas predates the importation of
slaves. It had deep roots among the natives of Latin America prior
to the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors, who helped perpetuate
the practice, Loveland said.
   In Esquipulas, a village in Guatemala, ``The Indians
prehistorically were taking clay from a clay bed and when the
Spanish arrived they thought they knew a good thing when they saw
it,'' she said. ``They built a cathedral at this clay bed (and)
manufactured the clay into capsules.
   ``These were blessed by the Catholic Church and ended up all
over.''
   The capsules, 2{ to 3 inches in diameter and decorated with
scenes of the crucifixion and other Christian icons, were sold to
pilgrims and converts. They were still in circulation until 10 or
15 years ago, said Loveland, who has a couple of them.
   Her study, begun in 1987, did reveal that certain kinds of clay
can help neutralize stomach acid. Other soil, containing kaolin and
bentonite _ found in over-the-counter diarrhea medicine _ have
value as intestinal remedies.
   Too much of such clay, however, could block the intestinal
tract, with serious _ possibly fatal _ results.
   To a limited degree, geophagia can be seen has having migrated
into the realm of accepted medical and nutritional use, though on a
more sophisticated level, said Utah State University soil scientist
Thomas Furst, who assisted in the study. ``You can go down to the
health food store and buy dolomite, or to a grocery store and buy
Tums, and that's basically calcium carbonate.''
   But at the more elemental level the risks increase markedly,
Furst warned.
   While some soil contains nutritional elements like magnesium,
phosphorus, potassium, calcium, iron, zinc and other minerals, that
same earth _ especially if high in organic matter _ can be teeming
with disease-carrying parasites.
   Some clays also can contain arsenic and people who munch urban
garden soil, believing it safe, could risk lead poisoning from
automobile exhaust residues.

<HEAD>Gnawed Slippery Elm May Be Sign Of Deer Sore Throats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAY FORMANEK Jr.</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CORE, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folks have used slippery elm bark for
centuries to cure everything from sore throats to constipation, and
researchers are trying to find out whether white-tailed deer in
some areas are doing the same.
   Dr. Edwin Michael, a wildlife researcher at West Virginia
University, said he first came upon slippery elms that had been
stripped of their bark near this coal town just south of the
Pennsylvania border in 1981.
   After further observation, he concluded that a few deer, in
widely scattered areas, were responsible. ``This is not typical
deer behavior. These deer are choosing a particular species of
tree, at a particular time of year, and going to a lot of trouble
to strip the bark from them.
   ``There must be some reason.''
   Michael has just begun a two-year study to find out why some
deer prefer chewing the tender, inner bark of the slippery elm
while shunning neighboring trees, including such usual favorites as
maple and black cherry.
   ``Our first guess is that there is a lack of quantity or quality
in their food supply,'' he said. ``But the deer, at some point,
also must have learned that the bark is satisfying. Do they use it
as a cure or temporary relief for what ails them? I think that's
wild speculation, but it's possible.''
   Ripping the bark from the exposed roots and lower parts of the
tree is no easy task for the deer, which have no upper front teeth.
Nonetheless, deer in some parts of western Monongalia County have
stripped the bark from hundreds of slippery elms, killing most of
the saplings, he said.
   Evidence of similar behavior has been reported in Greene County,
Pa., north of Hagerstown, Md., and at Front Royal, Va.
   ``You might find 100 or 200 trees stripped clean in one spot,
but a mile or two away, where there are just as many deer and just
as many slippery elms, there will be no signs of bark stripping at
all,'' Michael said.
   ``How do they recognize that the tree is a slippery elm? Do they
smell it? Do they know it by sight? How do you explain the
scattered pockets of the behavior?''
   Indians used slippery elm bark as a remedy for coughs, sore
throats and to promote healing, said Clarke Ridgeway, a West
Virginia University expert on the historical development of drugs.
``They introduced it to the early colonists, who adapted Indian
remedies in the 1600s when they could not obtain their usual
medicines from Europe.''
   Still available in some pharmacies and a popular item in health
food stores, slippery elm bark is a mucilage that acts as a barrier
to irritation and has a lubricating effect when mixed with water.
   It doesn't have any antibacterial action but does contain a
number of sugars which make it a good source of food for deer when
other browse is in short supply, Ridgeway said. ``The deer could be
using it as a preferred source of nutrition. Or they could like the
way it swells up into an oily, gelatinous mass when they chew it.''
   Complicating Michael's research is ``that we don't know when a
deer has a sore throat. We don't know when a deer is ailing until
it's about to die.
   ``Do deer get sore throats? They must. There's no reason to
think that only people do. Now, is it only deer with sore throats
that are stripping the bark?
   ``We, of course, don't think that is the case. But it's
possible. We don't give wildlife enough credit for what they do.''

<HEAD>Droughts Linked to Position of Sun and Moon, Researchers Believe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Periodic droughts in the western United
States may be linked to changes in the positions of the sun and
moon, researchers say.
   Charles W. Stockton of the University of Arizona says there's no
``physical proof that these changes actually would influence
drought,'' but since 1600 recurring drought coincided with solar
and lunar cycles.
   By studying and extrapolating astronomical data, Stockton said,
it may be possible to forecast droughts. Based on the research, he
said, the West's next drought, which will be severe but not
widespread, will be in the late 1990s.
   Stockton, David Meko of Arizona's tree-ring laboratory, and J.
Murray Mitchell Jr., a retired climatologist with the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, found clues in tree rings,
which vary based on rainfall.
   Severe but localized droughts, similar to last year's in the
Midwest, occur during the solar minimum, the period in the sun's
22-year cycle when sunspots diminish to their lowest number,
Stockton said. The same thing occurs during the lunar cycle when
the moon lines up with the sun, every 18.6 years.
   When those two phenomena occur in roughly the same year, about
every two centuries, a devastating drought should sear most of the
West, Stockton said, adding that the last such occurrence was in
the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s.
   No one knows how the cycles may alter Earth's climate, but
``there is some evidence now that the luminosity of the sun changes
with sunspot numbers,'' he said. That is, the fewer the sunspots,
the hotter the sun's surface.
   Whether it would be hot enough to trigger drought is an
unanswered question, Stockton said, adding that the sunspots could
cause a slight rise in temperature, evaporating water from the
Earth's surface, killing many plants.
   The lunar link is more elusive, he said.

<HEAD>Panther Reintroduction Program Halted After Texas Cougar Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers hoping to help endangered
Florida panthers expand and move outside the Everglades have cut
short part of a test after four of seven cougars being used as
surrogates died or were killed.
   The last two alive were captured last week near Osceola National
Forest, said Tom Logan of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission. ``The two animals would not have given us any new
information. We don't feel it's prudent or productive to leave the
animals out in the field.''
   Of the seven Texas cougars released in North Florida to see how
panthers might adapt outside South Florida's Everglades, one died
of unknown causes, two were shot by poachers and one was injured
while being captured by wildlife officers and had to be killed. A
fifth was captured about two weeks ago.
   Of the two captured last week, one was found napping in a tree
in a residential Jacksonville neighborhood and the other had been
hunting exotic deer at a private hunting preserve north of Lake
City.
   The Florida panther once roamed North Florida, but is now
confined to the Everglades where officials estimate no more than 50
survive. The last confirmed North Florida sighting of one of the
big cats was in the early 1960s.
   Wildlife officials had planned to end the program in June, a
year after the release of the first five cougars; two more were
released in March.
   ``When we had the original group, they behaved as they should.
When the numbers were reduced, things started happening,'' Logan
said. ``We need to evaluate the number of animals out there and how
it affects them.''
   Until information from the experiment is evaluated, Logan said
he could not recommend whether Florida panthers should be released
in North Florida.

<DATELINE>PERDIDO BEACH, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beach mice threatened with extinction
on the Central Gulf Coast have emerged from winter breeding in
greater numbers, but there still aren't many of the tiny
night-wandering creatures.
   Scientists aren't sure what role the Choctawhatchee, Alabama and
Perdido Key beach mice play in the environment; they seem to be
closely associated to the growth of sea oats, but even that has not
been proven.
   In 1986, alarmed U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists began
trapping and removing the mice from the path of condominium
construction booms along the Gulf. Thirty Perdido Key mice were
moved to the Gulf Islands National Seashore. The Perdido Key mice
were completely eliminated from Florida during Hurricane Frederic
in 1979, and the only remaining ones were on the Alabama beach.
   The mice now are reported thriving in the 7-mile protected Gulf
Islands preserve, said Nick Holler, a professor at Auburn
University, where some pairs were taken for breeding. The Perdido
Key mice were the ``most threatened and probably still are,''
Holler said.
   Some have been trapped in the Bon Secour Wildlife Refuge and
Fort Morgan, both west of Gulf Shores. They are being introduced to
the colony in captivity against the possibility of another
hurricane wiping out the wild population.
   The main threats to the 3-inch mice are still people walking on
sand dunes where the mice burrow to live, and cats. Other predators
are owls and foxes.
   Other threatened or endangered species also are finding refuge
in National Park Service's Gulf Islands National Seashore, said
spokeswoman Suzanne Lewis. Projects there include efforts to
re-establish populations of Southern Bald Eagles, Brown Pelicans
and Red Wolves.
   Horn Island, a wilderness barrier island in the Mississippi
portion of the preserve, has been the release site for 19 young
eagles since 1985. Plans call for up to 50 birds to be released
this year on the Mississippi Gulf Coast.
   Horn Island also will be the release site for a pair of Red
Wolves to begin five years of research on the biology of the
animals. Young wolves also will be released on the Alligator River
National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed in thin early European
trading today. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the dollar will have difficulty
shrugging off last week's European interest rate shuffle. They said
the start of trading on Wall Street later today might give new
impetus to dollar selling.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.07 yen to a closing 131.38. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 131.30 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Friday's
prices, included: 1.8491 West German marks, up from 1.8460; 1.6317
Swiss francs, down from 1.6320; 6.2712 French francs, up from
6.2625; 2.0853 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0830; 1,357.00 Italian
lire, down from 1,357.50; and 1.1873 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1890.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7137, compared with
$1.7160 Friday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $383.50 a troy ounce,
down from $384.50 bid late Friday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $383.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $383.90, down from $384.15 bid late
Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 32 cents to close at a bid
$385.06.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.76 a troy
ounce, down from Friday's $5.78.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups: Bush Moving with Speed of a `Glacier' on Issues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three months into the Bush administration,
consumer groups are still uncertain about what to expect, with one
advocate saying the administration is moving ``with all the speed
of a glacier.''
   Some say the pendulum is swinging back to more activity in
consumer protection. Others say the signals are still confused.
   Consumer advocates were thrown on the defensive by the Reagan
administration's anti-government, anti-regulation stance.
   David Stockman, Reagan's first budget director, once wrote that
consumer groups had ``created this whole facade of consumer
protection in order to seize power in our society. I think part of
the mission of this administration is to unmask and discredit that
false ideology.''
   Consumer groups have not forgotten that George Bush's first
assignment from Ronald Reagan was head of a task force charged with
reducing regulatory burdens.
   Joan Claybrook, head of Public Citizen, the umbrella advocacy
group founded by Ralph Nader, said, ``As vice president, George
Bush was one of the most anti-consumer, anti-health and safety
public officials we've ever had.''
   Mark Silbergeld, director of the Washington office of Consumers
Union, said that Bush's record was one of ``relieving business of
its health, safety and consumer protection obligations.'' But
Silbergeld refused to read that record as a prediction.
   ``New offices often bring new obligations,'' he said. But
there's no sign yet what Bush's new office will mean for consumers,
Silbergeld said.
   ``The administration is preparing to deal with consumer issues
with all the speed of a glacier,'' he said.
   Miss Claybrook would agree with that: ``The Consumer Product
Safety Commission is twisting slowly in the wind,'' unable to act
because the current two commissioners do not even make up a quorum,
she said.
   ``We are being neglected and that's a bad sign,'' said Pamela
Gilbert, a lawyer with the Public Interest Research Group, another
Nader-influenced outfit sharing office space with Public Citizen.
   She said she is not worried that Bush will attack government
regulations again. ``What we fear is business as usual,'' with
consumer protection agencies languishing under small budgets and
unfilled appointments.
   Robert Abrams, attorney general of New York State and president
of the National Association of Attorneys General, said, ``There is
concern that no new name has surfaced as the new chairman of the
Federal Trade Commission. ... One understands that it takes a while
for a new administration to get organized, but I think we're now at
the point where there begins to be some scratching of the head
whether there has been undue delay.''
   Daniel Oliver's term has expired as chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission and he is serving in a holdover status.
   Abrams said he was uncertain what direction the administration's
consumer policies would take, but ``There's no question that we in
the states look forward to the federal watchdog agencies returning
to their traditional role where they have the resources and the
authorities to move effectively.''
   But the administration has not decided whether to support,
oppose or stand indifferent to a bill renewing the legislative
authority of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Anne Graham, acting chairman of the two-member commission, is
taking no position on the bill, which incorporates what critics
call micromanagement through many directives.
   She supports a provision that would permit two members to be a
quorum when the commission has only three members.
   Ms. Graham looks for a lowering of the voices and less
confrontation. ``You have Jim Florio (a Democratic member of the
House from New Jersey who chairs the consumer protection
subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee) and Joe Barton
(a conservative Texas Republican) on the bill'' as sponsors. ``We
couldn't have had that three or four years ago.''
   It's impossible to tell, though, where the commission is headed
without knowing who will be the third member. ``If I had to guess,
I'd say we'd be a little more active,'' she said.
   ``President Bush has made it clear he cares about children and
this agency concentrates a great deal on children,'' spending half
its budget on them, she said.
   Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, is encouraged by January's FTC action accusing
Campbell Soup Co. of false advertising for failing to disclose high
sodium concentrations in its soups.
   Under Oliver, the commission almost gave up on filing false
advertising cases against national advertisers and pursued smaller
health-food marketers instead.
   ``I think we'll see the pendulum swing back andstay there for
awhile,'' Silverglade said.
   Not everybody agrees. Silbergeld was asked, Is the pendulum
swinging back? He replied, ``No, other than in the environmental
area.''
   Silverglade, said Silbergeld, sees the soup case ``as a
harbinger of a kind because that is his area. I'd like to see more,
and I would like to see them go up and ask for the budgets to do
the job.''

<HEAD>Swiss Drug Giant To Transform Structure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASEL, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   F. Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co., the Swiss
chemical and pharmaceutical company, today announced a major
overhaul that involves formation of a holding company and
elimination of its current share structure.
   The restructuring is intended to increase management efficiency,
enhance operational flexibility and satisfy the market's call for a
simpler share structure, Hoffmann-La Roche said. The changes also
take into account proposed reforms of the Swiss company law.
   The plan, announced at a news conference in Basel at which the
company also released its latest financial results, quieted
speculation that Hoffmann-La Roche would use the occasion to
announce plans to seek control of another pharmaceutical concern.
   Hoffmann-La Roche chairman Fritz Gerber declined to comment on
whether the new structure would place the company in a better
position to launch a takeover bid for Philidelphia-based SmithKline
Beckman Corp. or Britain's Beecham Group PLC. The two companies
have announced their intention to merge.
   Hoffmann-La Roche's announcement last Friday that it had
scheduled a news conference for today to discuss a series of
significant measures stirred speculation that it might be preparing
an offer for one of the companies.
   Under the current twin share structure, each owner of
Hoffmann-La Roche shares or dividend rights certificates also owns
shares in Sapac Corp., a New Brunswick, N.J.-based affiliated
company which handles business in North and South America, Asia,
parts of Afria, Australia, Britain and other places.
   The new structure would convert these dual stock holdings into
shares in a holding company that would comprise interests held by
both Hoffmann-La Roche and Sapac.
   Sapac shares are to be called in and Sapac is to become a
subsidiary of the new holding company, called Roche Holding AG.
   In addition, the proposed group holding company would own a new
Basel-based subsidiary, consisting of Roche and Sapac's operating
functions.
   A third stage of the restructuring would reshuffle and
significantly enlarge Hoffmann-La Roche's stock base. Under the
proposed structure, the company's share capital would be increased
in a series of stages.
   Gerber, in describing the overhaul to reporters, called it a
logical step in the company's adjustment to future needs. He said
the changes would make Hoffmann-La Roche stock more accessible to a
broader base of investors.
   Separately, Hoffmann-La Roche said its profit rose 33.1 percent
to 641.5 million Swiss francs, the equivalent of $389 million at
today's exchange rates, up from from 482 francs in 1987.

   Stock prices pulled back today as traders cashed
in some of the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 11.92 points to
2,397.54 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 370 up, 602 down and
510 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.30 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said it was not surprising to see the market run into
some resistance after its sharp rise over the past four weeks.
   They also noted that weakness in blue chips often occurs after
they have been driven higher, as they were late Friday, by computer
program trades related to a set of expiring stock index options or
futures.
   Aside from those technical forces, analysts said hopes remained
high on Wall Street that interest rates would turn downward before
long.
   An increase last Thursday in key West German interest rates sent
a brief jolt through the stock market. But it quickly recovered as
traders concluded that the Federal Reserve wouldn't take any
similar action.
   International Business Machines, which raised its quarterly
dividend from $1.10 a share to $1.21 a share, gained ] to 113~.
   Syntex fell 2{ to 44}. The stock rose sharply Friday on
speculation that F. Hoffmann-LaRoche &amp; Co. might be preparing to
make a bid for the company.
   But those expectations died down today when Hoffmann-La Roche
announced an internal restructuring plan.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .61 to 172.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .35 at 342.24.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 32.08 to
2,409.46, closing above 2,400 for the first time since it stood at
2,412.70 on Oct. 14, 1987.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 936 up, 517 down and 478 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 187.31 million shares, against 175.97

<HEAD>Sears Cites Accounting Change For 64 Percent First-Quarter Profit
Drop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today reported a 63.7
percent drop in its first quarter net income but the retailing
giant said the results were distorted by an accounting change that
inflated last year's earnings.
   Excluding the $544.2 million credit Sears gained in the first
quarter of 1988 with a new accounting method, the company's net
income rose 56.3 percent in the first quarter of 1989, Sears said
in a news release.
   Sears reported net income of $257.7 million, or 70 cents a
share, for the first three months of this year. The figure compared
with $709.1 million, or $1.87 a share, for the same period a year
ago.
   First-quarter revenue rose 10.9 percent to $12.16 billion,
compared with $10.96 billion in 1988's first quarter.
   Chairman Edward A. Brennan said all Sears business groups
reported record-high quarterly revenue.
   Sales of the Sears Merchandise Group, the retailing division,
rose 11.9 percent to $6.76 billion during the first quarter from
$6.04 billion a year earlier. The division's revenue jumped 16.4
percent in March following the introduction of a new low pricing
policy.
   ``We are delighted with consumer response,'' Brennan said. ``The
results confirmed our belief that everyday low pricing is an idea
whose time has come.''
   Sears also owns Allstate Insurance, Dean Witter Financial
Services and Coldwell Banker Real Estate.

<HEAD>Soybeans, Corn Futures Plunge On Wetter Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices fell sharply
today on the Chicago Board of Trade following a rainy weekend in
some key growing areas.
   Wheat futures opened slightly higher, reflecting continued
dryness in Kansas.
   Weekend showers brought relief to parts of western Illinois and
eastern Iowa, a section of the Corn Belt still struggling to
recover from last year's drought.
   ``We got a lot of rain where it was needed and there's a lot
more rain in the forecast for this week,'' said Victor Lespinasse,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Corn and soybean prices also were pressured by heavy farmer
selling of those commodities over the weekend.
   But the weather remained warm and dry over the weekend in
Kansas, where the winter wheat crop has been severely damaged by
drought conditions.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.16 a bushel; corn was 5 cents to
6} cents lower with May at $2.70\ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to 5
cents lower with May at $1.97{ a bushel; soybeans were 12 cents to
15\ cents lower with May at $7.48 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June at
71.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .48 cent
higher with May at 76.65 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent to .40
cent lower with June at 45.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .20 cent lower to .13 cent higher with May at 31.10 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Friday.

<HEAD>Comsat Earnings Rise 16 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Comsat Corp. said Monday its earnings rose 16
percent in the first three months of 1989, primarily from growth in
its international satellite operations.
   Comsat said international telecommunications revenues grew due
to increased traffic demand, but were offset partly by promotion
discounts instituted in the second half of 1988. Maritime revenue
growth resulted from increased telephone traffic, mainly from
cruise ships and other commercial vessels, Comsat said.
   Net income for the quarter ending March 31 was $16.5 million, or
89 cents a share, on revenues of $97.4 million, compared with
earnings of $14.3 million, or 77 cents a share, on earnings of
$84.1 million in the first quarter of 1988.
   International revenues increased to $67.8 million in the
quarter, compared with $56.5 million in the first quarter of 1988.
   Comsat's video entertainment segment showed a $3.2 million
operating loss on revenues of $11.7 million in the first three
months of 1989, compared with a $1.2 million loss on revenues of
$10.9 million in first quarter 1988. Comsat attributed the loss to
increased marketing and operating costs.
   Comsat is a publicly traded corporation which provides
international, domestic and maritime communications and information
services. It represents the United States in the International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Intelsat) and the
International Maritime Satellite Organization (Inmarsat).

   A federal bankruptcy judge today postponed for
the second time a hearing over whether strike-bound Eastern
Airlines should be put up for sale in its entirety.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland rescheduled today's
hearing for May 3 to give potential buyers more time to examine
Eastern financial data and to give parties involved in the
airline's bankruptcy case more time to negotiate over a possible
reorganization plan.
   The judge has asked Eastern, its unions and major creditors to
demonstrate why the airline shouldn't be put up for auction in its
entirety, including its Northeast shuttle service slated to be sold
to developer Donald Trump.
   Meanwhile, a ``household name'' financial institution has
recently emerged as a new serious bidder for Eastern, along with
billionaire hotelier Jay Pritzker, Trans World Airlines Inc.
Chairman Carl Icahn and ex-baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth, according to sources close to the situation.
   And Mohamed Hadid, a Washington real estate investor who
recently agreed to buy the Ritz-Carlton hotels in Washington and
New York, confirmed through an associate Friday he is interested in
buying Miami-based Eastern.
   Pritzker, who reportedly has offered around $500 million for
Eastern, has been given access to confidential financial data
concerning the airline, bankruptcy examiner David I. Shapiro
confirmed today.
   Shapiro also said TWA officials had expressed interest in
getting access to the financial data, which is being released to
parties who agree to confidentiality restrictions.
   Ueberroth, whose $464 million deal to buy Eastern collapsed
April 12, also is believed to still be interested in the carrier.
   Eastern's management is expected to present early this week to a
committee representing its major creditors a plan for sharply
reducing its operations and selling substantial assets. On
Thursday, the creditors committee, which also includes union
representatives, discussed a financial review of the airline by the
investment firm Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.
   Union leaders and their advisers, meanwhile, have been sifting
through a pile of offers for the carrier to determine whether they
are viable. The unions, who have been approached by a number of
suitors, interviewed one such candidate Thursday evening and
eventually decided he was ``a wash-out,'' sources said.
   Around 25 would-be buyers have had some sort of contact with the
unions since Eastern's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing on March 9,
including about a dozen who were considered serious enough for more
extensive talks, the sources said.
   The airline has been virtually grounded since March 4, when its
Machinists union struck over a long-simmering wage dispute and
pilots and flight attendants walked out in sympathy.

<HEAD>Profits Fell During First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beckman Corp., which has reached
agreement to merge with Great Britain's Beecham Group subject to
stockholder approval, announced Monday sales were up in the first
quarter, but profits fell sharply.
   Net earnings fell 22 percent to $130.2 million from the $166.5
million a year ago. Sales rose 7 percent to $1.24 billion, compared
to $1.16 billion in the 1988 January-to-March quarter.
   Profits translate to $1.05 a share compared to $1.34 in the
similar 1988 period.
   Henry Wendt, chairman and chief executive, said the decline in
earnings in the quarter was in line with expectations.
   The primary factor was the adverse comparison of U.S.
pharmaceutical sales with a period of heavy trade stocking in early
1988, which made sales unusually high, the company said. The rise
of the dollar also depressed the dollar value of overseas earnings
and sales.
   Clinical Laboratory sales climbed 69 percent, or $80 million,
reflecting last year's second quarter acquisition of International
Clinical Laboratories.
   SmithKline Beckman and Beecham announced April 12 that it had
reached agreement to merge. Besides stockholders' approval it needs
regulatory approval and a proxy statement is expected to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission in mid-May.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit by consumer activist Ralph Nader, environmentalists and
others seeking a government ban on the chemical Alar.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out
the suit.
   Alar, sold by Uniroyal Chemical Co., is used primarily to
enhance the color and uniform ripening of apples.
   Some studies have shown it can cause cancer in animals, and may
be a serious health risk to humans, particularly children.
   But the Environmental Protection Agency on Jan. 6, 1987,
rejected a plea by environmentalists and others to ban Alar. The
agency said it lacked sufficient evidence to order it off the
market.
   Instead, 10 days later the EPA lowered by one-third the
allowable amounts of the chemical that may remain as residues in
apples. The new rule was designed as an interim measure to permit
more time for the agency to study Alar's effects.
   Nader and the others whose petition was denied by the EPA filed
a federal suit aimed at forcing the agency to ban Alar.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last October threw out the
suit for procedural reasons.
   The appeals court said the EPA could be exposed to a barrage of
lawsuits if forced to go to court every time it denied a petition
like the one submitted for Alar.
   ``EPA could conceivably be forced to appear continually in
appellate courts defending regulations long established that
parties failed to contest at the time of their promulgation,'' the
9th Circuit court said. ``If Congress had intended such a result,
it is unlikely it would have prescribed a fixed deadline for
appeals from regulations.''
   The Bush administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the
environmentalists' bid to revive their suit.
   Citizens who file petitions with the environmental agency should
not be allowed to bypass administrative procedures established by
federal law, Justice Department lawyers said.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Turned away an appeal by deposed Philippine President
Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, Imelda, aimed at overturning a court
order freezing their assets.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that, in effect,
requires the Marcoses to defend themselves in a lawsuit filed by
the Philippine government. The lower court order also bars them
from transferring most of their alleged vast wealth.
   _ Agreed to review a judge's order raising property taxes to
help pay for racially desegregating public schools in Kansas City,
Mo.
   The justices said they will hear arguments that the judge
overstepped his authority when imposing the tax hike for all
property within the city's school district.
   _ Let stand a ruling that a federal judge may overrule federal
environmental officials and permit use of an allegedly dangerous
pesticide.
   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal by
environmentalists and organized labor in a case, involving the
pesticide dinoseb, of particular importance to farmers in Idaho,
Oregon and Washington state.
   _ Left intact a $101 million refund the nation's telephone
companies were ordered to pay customers for excessive charges in
1978.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the Federal
Communications Commission overstepped its authority in ordering the
refunds.
   _ Agreed to decide whether the government may tax as income the
deposits that utility companies demand from customers to ensure
payment of future bills.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal in a
case involving an Indiana electric utility.
   _ Agreed to decide whether an Indian tribe can prosecute members
of other tribes for crimes on its reservation.
   The court said it will review a ruling that gives the Salt River
Pima-Maricopa Community in Arizona authority to prosecute a
California man accused in the fatal shooting of a 14-year-old boy.
   _ Agreed to judge the validity of a federal law allowing the use
of abandoned rail line rights-of-way for nature trails.
   The court said it will decide in a case from Vermont whether the
law unconstitutionally deprives some property owners of the use of
their land without providing ``just compensation.''
   The Alar case is Nader vs. EPA, 88-1146.

<HEAD>First-Quarter Earnings Up at Union Carbide, Monsanto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. reported Monday its first-quarter profits
nearly doubled on the strong performance of its chemical and
plastics businesses, while another chemical manufacturer, Monsanto
Co., said its earnings for the same period rose 6 percent.
   Danbury-based Carbude reported first-quarter net income of $201
million, or $1.44 per share, up from $101 million, or 75 cents per
share, for the same period a year ago.
   Sales rose to $2.2 billion, from $1.9 billion a year earlier.
   All of Carbide's segments _ chemicals and plastics, industrial
gases and carbon products _ reported sales increases.
   Overall operating profit for the quarter increased 44 percent to
$427 million, reflecting a 54 percent increase in the operating
profit of the chemicals and plastics segment.
   Carbide Chairman Robert D. Kennedy said in a prepared statement
sales volume continued to be strong and that the company continued
to benefit from the favorable cost of raw materials.
   At Monsanto, first-quarter earnings totaled $222 million, or
$3.24 per share, up from $210 million, or $2.86 per share, during
the first three months of 1988.
   First-quarter sales increased to $2.27 billion from the $2.13
billion recorded in the first quarter of last year.
   The St. Louis-based company said it had increased sales for
several of its varied products, including Roundup and Lasso
herbicides, Aliment animal feed supplement and NutraSweet
artificial sweetener.
   Monsanto also said its G.D. Searle pharmaceuticals unit took ``a
major step toward its goal of profitability in 1989.''
   Searle's first-quarter results improved significantly from a
year ago, largely on the continuing strength of Calan SR, an
anti-hypertensive drug.

   ITT Corp.'s profit rose 12 percent in the first
quarter on a 6 percent increase in revenue, the conglomerate said
Monday.
   ITT said it earned $200 million, or $1.40 a share, up from $180
million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $4.8
billion from $4.5 billion.
   Tax benefits at The Hartford insurance unit added $8 million to
the 1989 quarter's net income and $12 million to that of the 1988
quarter, ITT said.
   Revenue in the 1988 quarter was restated to reflect an insurance
accounting standard adopted at the end of 1988. The change did not
affect net income figures.
   ITT said all its service businesses registered gains except for
the Hartford, whose results reflected a general downturn in
domestic property and casualty underwriting. Sheraton Corp., ITT's
hotel segment, registered strong gains, mainly in Europe and Asia,
it said.
   On the product side, operating results improved in the
automotive, defense and fluid technology businesses, while
electronics' components results remained basically the same.
Alcatel NV, 37 percent owned by ITT, contributed higher earnings,
ITT said.

<HEAD>British Food Retailer Gateway Says It Was Approached by Kohlberg
Kravis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British food retailer Gateway Corp., the target of
a hostile $2.9 billion takeover bid from a group of British
investors, said Monday it has been approached by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts and Co., the U.S. leveraged buyout house.
   A Gateway spokeswoman, who didn't want to be identified further,
said the talks with Kohlberg Kravis were preliminary but might lead
to further discussions.
   Gateway said the approach was one of several it has received
since the investor group made its hostile 1.7 billion pound bid
last Tuesday.
   The spokeswoman declined to identify the other parties who
approached the company.
   Gateway has rejected as inadequate the bid from the investor
group, which is led by the London investment firm S.G. Warburg and
Co., and includes Globe Investment Trust PLC and Mercury Asset
Management Ltd., both institutional investors in Gateway. Mercury
is a unit of Warburg.
   The group intends to restructure Gateway by selling off its
non-food businesses, such as its Herman's sporting goods chain in
the United Sattes.
   The Warburg-led group, called Isoceles PLC, would privately own
the remaining interests, with the aim of taking them public again
within three to five years.
   Gateway, formerly called Dee Corp., last year fended off a
hostile 2.04 billion pound, or $3.49 billion, bid from Barker and
Dobson Group PLC, a confectionery company.
   Gateway, which operates some 820 stores, is Britain's third
largest food retailer after J. Sainsbury PLC and Tesco PLC.

<TEXT>
   The United States and the European Economic
Community are near an agreement in their dispute over an EEC ban on
imports of U.S. beef treated with growth-boosting hormones, a Dutch
official said Monday.
   U.S. officials have agreed to let the EEC certify U.S. beef due
to be exported to the EEC as having been raised without the use of
hormones, Dutch Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Yvonne van
Rooy said.
   The tentative accord, reached by a U.S-EEC panel of experts,
``has solved 80 percent of the problem,'' Mrs. Van Rooy told
reporters outside an EEC foreign ministers meeting.
   An official at the U.S. mission to the EEC in Brussels declined
to comment except to say that negotiations were continuing.
   EEC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen briefed the
foreign ministers on the tentative agreement.
   ``There was general satisfaction (among the EEC states) that the
Americans have agreed in principle to a certification system,''
said an EEC source, who asked not to be named.
   Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, the Spanish minister who chaired
the ministers meeting, said it was ``still too early to say what
the outcome of the (hormone) conflict will be.'' But, he told
reporters, he ``glimpsed the possibility of a solution.''
   Under the accord, EEC inspectors at U.S. meat plants would
certify no hormones were used to raise beef due to shipped to any
of the 12 EEC nations.
   But the EEC source said U.S. and EEC officials ``have yet to
quantify how much beef could be exported to the Community under the
certification procedure, including offal that is used in meat
products. The question remains if it (the United States) could
still export the same amount of beef as it did previously.''
   The EEC, citing health reasons, banned all imports of
hormone-treated meat as of Jan. 1. The ban affects about $100
million in U.S. beef to the EEC annually.
   Initially, it was to affect $140 million but this was reduced
after the EEC agreed to exclude beef used for pet food.
   The U.S. has threatened to retaliate against EEC imports. That,
in turn, led the EEC to threaten counter-retaliatory measures
against U.S. exports of walnuts and dried fruit.
   A special EEC-U.S. task force was formed Feb. 18 to study the
issue as both sides agreed to hold off on any retaliation during a
75-day ``cooling off period.''
   ``The United States has agreed to a certification policy'' under
which it would vouch that beef sent to the EEC was not raised on
growth-boosting hormones, Mrs. Van Rooy said.
   ``This is a success for Europe. The United States has shown to
be sufficiently realistic.''
   The EEC considers the use of such hormones harzardous to the
health of consumers. The United States has maintained there is no
scientific base for that.
   The cooling off period ends in early May. It was instituted to
prevent a trade war and allow the Bush administration come to grips
with the issue which it inherited from the Reagan administration.

<HEAD>Court Won't Overturn Takeover Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to overturn a
$15 million jury award stemming from the takeover of a California
manufacturer of semiconductor test equipment.
   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Eaton Corp. of
Cleveland, which was ordered to pay the money as punitive damages
to PKL Companies Inc.
   The case has its origins in the mid-1970s when a company called
Cutler-Hammer Inc. sought to acquire the stock of Macrodata Corp.
in California, the maker of semiconductor test equipment.
   PKL Companies was a minority shareholder in Macrodata. It filed
suit in 1976 accusing Cutler-Hammer of illegally depressing the
price of Macrodata stock.
   Eaton Corp. later took over Cutler-Hammer and a jury in
California ordered it to pay PKL Companies $2.6 million in actual
damages and $15 million as punishment for the illegal conduct.
   In the appeal acted on today, Eaton Corp. said the $15 million
award was unconstitutional. Eaton Corp. said it was innocent of any
wrongdoing and should not be made to pay for any misconduct by
Cutler-Hammer. It also said the $15 million award was excessive.
   The Supreme Court is considering a similar issue in another case
this year but decided today not to delay action in the Eaton Corp.
appeal pending that ruling, which is expected to be announced by
July.
   In urging the justices to reject the Eaton Corp. appeal, PKL
Companies said the Ohio corporation failed to raise constitutional
issues when the case was decided by the California courts.
   The case is Eaton Corp. vs. The PKL Companies, 87-1354.

<TEXT>
   Billionaire Marvin Davis has revised his
lawsuit challenging the ``poison pill'' takeover defense of NWA
Inc., the Northwest Airlines' parent company he wants to buy in a
$2.7 billion hostile tender offer.
   The lawsuit in the Court of Chancery in Wilmington, Del.,
originally sought to invalidate the pill. But at a hearing today,
lawyer Gilchrist Sparks said Davis is asking only for the
elimination of a provision that would prevent a new board of
directors from dismantling the pill for 180 days.
   Davis has launched a proxy fight to take control of the board of
directors at the company's May 15 annual meeting. If he were to
succeed, a provision in the ``poison pill'' plan would prevent the
new board from dismantling the takeover defense for 180 days.
   Such a provision would cripple the new board from accepting
legitimate buyout offers, thus hindering Davis' proxy fight, Sparks
said.
   ``Six months is a very long time,'' Sparks said. ``Stockholders
want to get the money now, not in six months. So they will vote for
whoever will get them the money now.''
   Chancellor William Allen said he would rule soon on the request.
   Sheldon Raab, a lawyer for Northwest, objected to the request.
He said the 180-day waiting provision ``has the purpose and effect
of getting would-be acquirers (such as Davis) to come to the board
and negotiate.''
   It is a way of ``buying time to get higher bids, explore
alternatives to get maximum shareholder value,'' Raab said. ``The
job of a corporation's director is not to shoot himself and his
shareholder in the foot,'' but to make a ``deliberated'' decision
on their behalf.
   Meanwhile, Northwest Chairman Steven Rothmeier says he would
like a ``white knight'' investor to come forward and work with
current management if Northwest Airlines cannot remain independent.
   Rothmeier told the Wall Street Journal the best course would be
for the company to remain independent and follow the growth
strategy he has charted for the nation's fourth-largest airline.
But he said the company is exploring putting a large stake in NWA
in the hands of friendly investors.
   ``There are potentially friendly investors out there,'' said
Rothmeier.
   Davis' tender offer stands at $90 a share even though the stock
has been trading well above that price. NWA stock closed Friday at
$102.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, up $3.75. The board was
scheduled to meet today to review the offer and other options.
   Rothmeier declined to identify any potential friendly investors,
but other NWA officials said 10 to 15 parties have expressed
interest in all or part of the company, the Journal reported. They
include leveraged buy-out firms and airline and air-freight
companies.
   A recapitalization involving a special shareholder dividend is
another option.
   NWA board member Robert A. Charpie, chairman of Cabot Corp. in
Boston, said the board had asked its investment advisers, First
Boston Corp., to examine the possibility of recapitalization.
   ``Many corporations have done well at it. Good managers can
manage highly leveraged companies,'' Charpie told the Journal.
   The only other investment group with a confirmed interest in
buying Northwest is led by Los Angeles investor and former Marriott
Corp. official Albert Checci and former NWA director Gary Wilson,
now an executive at Walt Disney Co. That group owns a 4.9 percent
stake in NWA and could be friendly to NWA management.
   The Journal reported that the Checci group has financial backing
from Elders IXL Ltd., one of Australia's largest companies with
interests in beer, wine, livestock and financial services. The
newspaper said neither Checci nor Elders could be reached for
comment.
   Meanwhile, the New York Times reported today that Kelso &amp; Co., a
small investment bank based in New York, has decided to consider a
bid for the airline. A spokesman for Kelso and a Northwest
spokesman declined to comment.

   Stock prices declined slightly today as traders
cashed in some of the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 72.40 points last
week, dropped 6.78 to 2,402.68 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 614 up, 785 down and
499 unchanged.
   Analysts said it was not surprising to see the market run into
some resistance after its sharp rise over the past four weeks.
   They also noted that weakness in blue chips often occurs after
they have been driven higher, as they were late Friday, by computer

   Share prices on London's Stock Exchange closed
marginally higher Monday as the market surrendered its early gains
after Wall Street opened lower.
   Cautious optimism that British interest rates might not rise
helped shares to post gains at the opening. Encouraging this view
were the pound's relative stability and a slight retreat in
short-term money market rates.
   But trading activity was dull as players awaited Wednesday's
release of British trade figures for March.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 1 point, or 0.05 percent, at 2,062.0. The Financial Times
30-share index was up 1.4 points at 1,701.9 at the close. The
Financial Times 500-share index rose 1.39 points to close at
1,173.13.
   Volume was light as 340.8 million shares changed hands, compared
with 400.7 million shares at the same time Friday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose against the major currencies
in European trading on Monday, helped by a weaker West German mark.
Gold prices also rose.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the mark dropped amid uncertainty
about where it is going, as a result of last week's Bonn government
reshuffle.
   But the decline of the mark could be reversed by an expected
government announcement of suspension of the 10 percent withholding
tax on income from interest.
   A possible additional plus for the mark is that the markets
expect the U.S. first-quarter gross national product figures due on
Wednesday will show the American economy has started to slow down.
Traders said that would reduce the likelihood of higher U.S.
interest rates and thereby make the mark more attractive.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7050 late Monday, more than
one cent cheaper for buyers than Friday's late $1.7160.
   In Tokyo the dollar eased to 131.38 Japanese yen from 131.45. In
London late Monday the dollar traded slightly lower at 131.37.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Friday's late rates, included: 1.8575 West German marks, up from
1.8460; 1.6395 Swiss francs, up from 1.6320; 6.2975 French francs,

   In Hong Kong gold closed at $384.05 a troy ounce, down from
$385.45 late Friday. Elsewhere, gold bullion prices rose.
   In London, the major market, gold was priced at $384.90 bid a
troy ounce late Monday, up from $384.40 late Friday. The late bid
price in Zurich was $384.65 an ounce, up from $384.15.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.81 bid a troy ounce,

<HEAD>Continental Announces Reduced Fare Plan For Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines, trying to garner more
business from families on summer vacations, unveiled a sale on
children's fares with some tickets as low as $1.
   Monday's announcement came on the heels of the Houston-based
carrier's decision to raise some of its fares at the start of the
busy summer tourist season. Several other airlines also have
decided to follow Continental's plan to increase some fares.
   Continental's new lower fares for children are immediately
available for purchase through May 26 for flights taken June 1
through Sept. 10. The new fares are available on all domestic
mainland Continental and Continental Express flights, and the $1
fares are good for travel on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.
   During the remainder of the week, children receive a 50 percent
reduction off Continental's so-called MaxSaver discount fares.
   For example, a family of four traveling on a Tuesday or
Wednesday between Newark, N.J., and Los Angeles would pay $718 now
for off-peak MaxSaver tickets, compared with $1,592 for tickets
purchased after May 26.
   Continental also said that families may change their
reservations once during the summer without any penalty if the
destination remains the same and the appropriate discount seats are
available.
   The new fares can be purchased for children ages 2 to 17, when
traveling with an adult who has purchased a MaxSaver ticket. A
family with two adults and four children would purchase three adult
MaxSaver tickets and three children's tickets if one child is 12
years or older.
   Continental said seats are limited and the new fares are
non-refundable.
   On April 13, Continental announced it would raise some of its
summer fares. The increases range up to $20 one way, depending on
the destination, and do not apply to first-class or full-fare coach
tickets.
   Continental is a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., one of the
nation's largest airline companies. Its sister carrier, Miami-based
Eastern Airlines, was hit by a strike starting March 4 and filed
for bankruptcy protection on March 9.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Melville Corp., owner of specialty retail stores across the
country, Monday reported a 7.9 percent increase in its
first-quarter income.
   The Harrison, N.Y.-based retailer said its after-tax earnings
totaled $24.2 million in the three months ended April 1, up from
$22.5 million in the corresponding period a year earlier.
   On a per-share basis, earnings came to 22 cents in this year's
first quarter compared with a restated 21 cents in 1988. Melville
stock was split Feb. 23.
   Sales amounted to $1.53 billion in the first quarter, an
increase of 9.7 percent from $1.39 billion in the first quarter of
1988, which had two more selling days than this year's first
quarter.
   Melville said the acquisition of Bermans Specialty Stores Inc.
in the fourth quarter of 1988 adversely impacted the first
quarter's operating results.
   Among the stores owned by Melville are Thom McAn shoe shops, the
off-price brand name apparel chain Marshalls, CVS drug stores,
Linens 'N Things and This End Up furniture stores. These and other
Melville-owned stores totaled 6,744 as of April 1, up from 6,117 a
year earlier.

   Martin Marietta Corp. reported Monday its
first-quarter earnings rose 16.2 percent as its sales edged up 1.6
percent.
   Martin Marietta said its earnings for the first three months
totaled $59.2 million, or $1.12 per share, up from $50.9 million,
or 96 cents per share, in the same period of last year.
   Sales for the quarter increased to $1.32 billion from nearly
$1.3 billion in the first quarter of 1988.
   The gains reflect strong performances by the two largest groups
within Martin Marietta, the astronautics and electronics and
missiles divisions, said Norman R. Augustine, chairman and chief
executive.
   ``Overall results are in line with expectations and support our
belief that full 1989 earnings will show further growth over
normalized 1988 earnings,'' Augustine said.
   Martin Marietta is an aerospace and information technology
company with more than 70,000 employees.

   Corn and soybean futures prices closed sharply
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade following heavy weekend
showers in one of the driest sections of the Corn Belt.
   Oats also closed with sharp losses but wheat futures gained
slightly on continued dry weather in the Great Plains.
   A weather system triggered severe thunderstorms in western
Illinois and eastern Iowa over the weekend but brought little
relief to the rest of the Midwest, where corn planting has begun
and soybean growers are preparing to plant.
   ``The coverage was probably less than 20 to 25 percent of each
state, but it was enough to create a negative atmosphere this
morning'' in the grain markets, said Mickey Luth, a soybean analyst
in Chicago with Shearson Lehmann Hutton Inc.
   The losses in the corn and soybean markets more than offset
Friday's steep gains.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 1} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.16 a bushel; corn was 6 cents to
7{ cents lower with May at $2.69\ a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 6{

<TEXT>
   Foreign and U.S. steelmakers share technology
and investment routinely these days as a fact of life in competing
for business in the global economy, two steel industry leaders said
Monday.
   ``We don't have a monopoly on steel in the U.S.A.,'' said
Vincent J. Pongia, president of the Association of Iron and Steel
Engineers, as the association's three-day spring conference began
Monday.
   ``It's a global economy today, particularly in the steel
market,'' said Herschel B. Poole, the association's managing
director and a former executive of USX Corp.
   The foreign influence in steelmaking is obvious at the
Cincinnati conference, which is attracting an estimated 1,000 steel
industry executives and engineers for two days of technical
presentations. The conference ends Wednesday with a tour of Armco
Inc.'s Middletown Works steel mill.
   Steel industry leaders from 10 industrialized nations are making
presentations at the conference on new steel production technology,
including automated controls and other new equipment. The total
includes 47 presentations by U.S. steel industry leaders and 10 by
Japanese leaders, six from Canada, five from the United Kingdom and
four from West Germany.
   Pongia said the association functions as a means by which
engineers from U.S. and foreign companies can exchange information
about technologies and any drawbacks.
   ``Engineers talk to one another, and very frankly. They won't
give away proprietary information,'' said Pongia, who has
experience as a steel industry engineer and as manager of
operations and maintenance functions.
   Shared investment between U.S. and foreign steelmakers in new
plants has become more widespread because of the enormous costs,
conference spokesman Russ Robinson said. A new continuous-casting
plant alone _ just part of a larger steel mill _ could cost $150
million, he said.
   Nucor Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., is building an innovative mill
in Crawfordsville, Ind., designed to roll thinner strips of steel
and move hot steel more quickly from casters to rolling equipment,
thus saving energy costs and production time.
   Pongia said the steel industry will be watching closely to see
whether the process is successful. The concept is based on
technology used in West Germany.
   Pongia is vice president of CitiSteel USA Inc., a Chinese-owned
company which renovated and reopened a 250-employee steel mill in
Claymont, Del. The owners purchased the company within the last
year.
   The Armco mill that will be toured is preparing to take
advantage of Japanese steel technology. Armco announced on March 27
that its Middletown-based Eastern Steel Division and Japan's
Kawasaki Steel Corp. signed an agreement under which Kawasaki will
buy a 40 percent share of the division for $350 million.
   Armco plans to ask its shareholders to approve the joint venture
at the company's annual meeting Friday in Whippany, N.J.
   Pongia said the steel industry has increased its spending on new
plants and expansion as the industry's financial comeback has
progressed from years of heavy losses in the early 1980s.
   The U.S. steel industry posted a collective $2.4 billion profit
last year and is increasing spending in capital improvement
projects this year to $2.3 billion, up by 28 percent from last
year, Pongia said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1986 tax overhaul added $1.7 billion a
year to the income taxes of U.S. property and casualty insurance
companies, an industry survey indicated Monday.
   For 1987, the new law boosted the tax bills of the
property-casualty companies to $3.5 billion, according to the Price
Waterhouse accounting firm. That included $92 million in
alternative minimum tax, a special levy designed to ensure that all
corporations with a profit pay some tax regardless of their
deductions.
   The companies' rising taxes were traced to three provisions in
the 1986 law that were aimed specifically at property-casualty
companies: loss reserve discounting, unearned-premium offset, and a
proration adjustment.
   The Price Waterhouse survey, released by Insurance Industry
Services, suggested the new law in the long run will mean an even
larger increase in property-casualty taxes, since operating losses
were used to offset a share of the companies' taxable income in
1987.
   The changes in the law raised the companies' taxable income by
$9.5 billion in 1987.
   The conclusions were based on a survey of insurance companies
that accounted for 79 percent of property-casualty premiums in 1987.

<HEAD>First-Quarter Earnings Down 13 Percent, But Not Because of Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp.'s first-quarter earnings fell 13
percent, the company said Monday, as rising crude oil prices took a
bite out of refining margins and the Alaskan oil spill took a toll
mostly on the company's image.
   For the three months ended March 31, earnings at the nation's
biggest oil company declined to $1.3 billion, or 99 cents a share,
from $1.5 billion, or $1.06 a share, in the first quarter of last
year. Revenue rose 1 percent to $22.2 billion compared with $22
billion in the 1988 period.
   Exxon, based in New York, said expenses grew fourfold from the
1988 first quarter _ to $5.4 billion from $1.3 billion _ due mainly
to special one-time costs, including the acquisition of Texaco
Canada Inc.
   Exxon said the March 24 spill that tarnished the reputation of
the nation's largest oil company had only a negligible financial
impact in the first period. Exxon said it charged $30 million for
``salvage expense, vessel repair and partial loss of cargo.''
   The huge Exxon Valdez oil tanker crashed into an underwater reef
off the Alaskan coast on March 24, spewing about 250,000 barrels of
oil into Prince William Sound.
   Exxon Chairman Lawrence G. Rawl said the company doesn't yet
know the full cost of the disaster.
   ``Exxon and Exxon Shipping Company carry insurance in
substantial amounts to deal with cleanups, damage claims and
liabilities resulting from oil spills,'' the company said. ``Based
on information to date, we cannot reasonably estimate the net
expense to be borne by Exxon and Exxon Shipping Company.''
   Rising world oil prices hurt Exxon's refining and marketing
earnings but helped its exploration and production income in the
first quarter, Rawl said.
   ``Contrary to some public perceptions, prices for motor gasoline
and other products did not increase as rapidly as crude oil
costs,'' the chairman said.
   World crude prices have risen about $10 a barrel in the last six
months and although gasoline retail prices have jumped in recent
weeks, analysts said they have not risen by a comparable amount per
gallon.
   ``That's the reason we're continuing to have a price rise in
April as they play catchup to crude,'' said Bruce Lazier, analyst
with Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
   Lazier said Exxon's earnings were good considering the crude
rise.
   Earnings from domestic exploration and production rose 22
percent to $343 million, compared with $281 million in the 1988
first period. Income from foreign exploration and production,
however, slid 20 percent to $513 million from $642 million.
   Refining profits, meanwhile, were down nearly 43 percent to $147
million from $431 million in last year's first quarter.
   Stephen Smith, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co., said he
expects a reversal in the second quarter as the rise in crude
prices is passed through to product prices, including gasoline.
   ``At some point, gasoline will take over as demand increases
with the driving season,'' Smith said.
   Exxon said first-quarter results reflected a $3.9 billion
expense for the acquisition of Texaco Canada Inc. by its Canadian
subsidiary, Imperial Oil Ltd. Texaco Inc. sold its 78 percent stake
in Texaco Canada in January.
   Exxon also purchased more than 15 million shares of its own
stock at a cost of $676 million.

   Swiss drug manufacturing giant F.
Hoffmann-La Roche &amp; Co. Inc. said Monday it will modernize its
share structure and reorganize its corporate framework.
   The changes would make it easier to invest in the company and
conform to pending changes in Swiss corporate law.
   Hoffmann-La Roche failed in a takeover bid for Sterling Drug
Inc. last year, and the streamlining could help the company in
other U.S. takeover attempts, some analysts said.
   The company's U.S. operations, which accounted for $1.9 billion
in revenue out of the parent's $6 billion, are based in Nutley.
   One school of thought holds that a global consolidation in the
pharmaceutical business is inevitable. SmithKline Beckman Corp. of
Philadelphia and Beecham Group PLC of London have merger plans, and
Monsanto Co. of St. Louis bought G.D. Searle in 1985. Eastman Kodak
Co. stepped in last January 1988 to thwart Hoffmann-La Roche's
designs in Sterling.
   The move would make it easier to exchange stock for shares in
another company Hoffmann may seek to acquire, said Louis C. Webb,
an analyst at Advest Group Inc. in Hartford, Conn.
   ``Drug makers are very attractive for acquisition,'' he said.
   The changes also could help pave the way for Hoffmann-La Roche
to list its stock on U.S. exchanges, said Michael Martorelli, an
analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia. It trades
only in Switzerland.
   ``Does it make it easier to list? Probably,'' he said. ``Will
they list? That's a different story.''
   Hoffmann-La Roche's chairman, Fritz Gerber, declined Monday to
comment on whether the changes would ease the way for a takeover
bid.
   The new structure, to be proposed at the company's annual
meeting May 31 in Basel, Switzerland, would eliminate the automatic
dual ownership of stock in both Swiss-based Roche Group and Sapac
Corp. Ltd.
   Under the 50-year-old arrangement, Sapac, incorporated in New
Brunswick, Canada, was the holding company for subsidiaries in
North and South America, Asia, Australia, the United Kingdom and
part of Africa.
   Now, Sapac would become a subsidiary of Roche Group, in which
shareholders would own stock.
   Further, the company would form Roche Holding Ltd., to become a
parent of F. Hoffmann-La Roche, which would assume control of
operations and liabilities.
   The holding company arrangement ``makes the corporation more
transparent to the outside world,'' the company said.
   Finally, Hoffmann-La Roche said it would reorganize its shares
to enlarge the stock base.

<HEAD>Salomon Inc. Reports First-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salomon Inc. said Monday it lost $28 million in
the first three months of the year, with profits in the company's
energy division partially compensating for $150 million in losses
by the company's securities and commodities arms.
   The loss was the latest in a series of gloomy financial reports
by Wall Street firms attributed to a sluggish securities business.
   Salomon, the parent of Salomon Brothers Inc., said the losses
compared to net income of $173 million, or $1.19 per share, in the
same period last year. Revenue declined 4.3 percent to $1.54
billion from $1.61 billion.
   The company reported a $95 million pre-tax loss by Salomon
Brothers and a $55 million loss by Philipp Brothers Inc., its
commodities brokerage arm. Those compared with earnings of $253
million by Salomon Brothers and $15 million by Philipp Brothers in
the 1988 first quarter.
   ``During periods of high market volatility, thr company's
trading operations often show wide swings _ sometimes favorable and
sometimes adverse,'' Salomon said in a statement. ``The first
quarter was one of those periods.''
   Salomon said its energy division, Phibro Energy, made $98
million before taxes, more than 2{ times as much as in the same
period last year, boosted by oil price increases and added refining
capacity.
   The firm said a $72 million pre-tax loss was reduced by a $44
million income tax benefit.

<TEXT>
   Capital Cities-ABC Inc. said Monday its
first-quarter earnings rose 17.8 percent as its interest income
soared even as revenue tumbled 13 percent from a strong period a
year ago.
   Overall, the company said it earned $82.8 million, or $4.59 a
share, in the first quarter compared with $70.3 million, or $4.16 a
share, a year earlier.
   First-quarter revenue fell to $1.12 billion from $1.29 billion a
year earlier when ABC telecast the 1988 Super Bowl game and the
Winter Olympics.
   The latest results included interest income of $25.5 million, up
six times from interest income of $3.9 million a year earlier.
   The company said its operating income slipped 2 percent to
$163.8 million as its operating profit from broadcasting operations
slipped while income from publishing operations held steady.
   Nonetheless, the company said its ABC Television Network had a
modest profit in the first quarter in contrast with a significant
loss in 1988. It did not provide specific figures for either period.
   Previously, CBS said its network was profitable in the first
quarter and industry analysts estimate that General Electric Co.'s
NBC Television Network was profitable for the first three months of
1989. GE does not usually report specific figures for NBC.
   Peter Appert, media analyst for C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell
Inc., said the three major networks appear to be benefiting from a
strengthening in the advertising marketplace and their own previous
cost-cutting efforts.
   Capital Cities-ABC said the ad marketplace for both its network
and its TV stations as well as at ESPN, the cable network in which
it owns controlling interest ad marketplace, had improved.
   In addition to the ABC Television Network, Capital Cities-ABC
operates eight television stations, six radio networks and 21 radio
stations. It is a cable TV programmer and publishes newspaper,
shopping guides, business periodicals and books.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The parent company of Home Savings of
America, the nation's largest savings and loan, reported Monday
that its first-quarter earnings rose 34 percent, while CalFed Inc.
reported a 50.8 percent drop.
   Home's parent, H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co., deals almost entirely in
adjustable-rate mortgages on single-family homes.
   CalFed, the nation's fourth-largest thrift holding company and
parent of California Federal Savings and Loan, is increasing the
share of its home loans that have adjustable rates.
   H.F. Ahmanson &amp; Co. said first-quarter earnings rose to $39.2
million, or 40 cents per share, up from $29.2 million, or 30 cents
a share, from the first quarter of 1988, when Ahmanson had reported
a 66 percent profit drop due to a decline in earnings from sales of
mortgage-backed securities.
   Earning assets for the first quarter of this year grew by more
than 5 percent during the quarter to a record $38.7 billion on
March 31, up 11 percent from $3.9 billion one year ago.
   Ahmanson officials last month denied the influx was mostly due
to a switchover of funds from Gibraltar Savings and Loan, seized by
the federal government.
   California Federal Savings reported 1989 first-quarter net
earnings of $17.5 million, or 67 cents a share, compared to $34.4
million, or $1.27 a share for the first quarter of 1988.
   CalFed's deposit base increased 6.5 percent from $10.7 billion
at the end of March 1988 to $11.4 billion on the quarter just ended.
   CalFed Inc.'s assets totaled $28.3 billion at the end of March,
compared to $27.6 billion at the end of 1988.

   The dollar drifted higher Monday against most
major currencies in quiet worldwide trading.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said a troy
ounce of gold was bid at $386.75 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $2.50 from
late Friday.
   Dan Holland, an assistant vice president for Discount Corp.,
attributed Monday's dollar gains largely to technical factors.
``People were squaring up positions. There really wasn't anything
new.''
   Analysts said most dealers were awaiting the first-quarter gross
national product data, which will be released Wednesday. The dollar
could fall, they said, if the figures show the economy is slowing,
because that would decrease the likelihood of higher U.S. interest
rates.
   In Europe, the dollar got much of its support by weakness in the
West German mark, which reflected uncertainty of last week's
government reshuffling in Bonn. The mark's decline could be
reversed, though, by an expected government announcement of
suspension of the 10 percent withholding tax on income from
interest, analysts said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar eased to 131.38 Japanese yen from 131.45. The
dollar traded slightly lower at 131.37 yen in London, and at 131.55
yen in New York, up from 131.475 Friday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7050 late Monday, more than
one cent cheaper for buyers than Friday's late $1.7160. Sterling
stood at $1.70625 in New York, down from $1.7135 Friday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.86075 West German marks, up from 1.8485; 1.6420 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6305; 1.18925 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18685;
6.3070 French francs, up from 6.2720; and 1,364.625 Italian lire,
up from 1,357.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday: 1.8575 West
German marks, up from 1.8460; 1.6395 Swiss francs, up from 1.6320;
6.2975 French francs, up from 6.2625; 2.0960 Dutch guilders, up
from 2.0830; 1,362.50 Italian lire, up from 1,357.50; and 1.1890
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1850.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery rose to $387.70 a troy ounce from Friday's $384.90.
   Gold was bid in London at $384.90 an ounce, up from $384.40 late
Friday, and in Zurich at $384.65 an ounce, up from $384.15.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.05 an ounce, down
from $385.45 late Friday.
   Silver prices gained ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery closed at $5.825 a troy ounce, up from $5.756.
Silver rose in London to $5.81 an ounce from $5.78.

   Stock prices posted spotty losses Monday as
traders cashed in some of the market's recent gains.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 72.40 points last
week, slipped 6.78 to 2,402.68.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 6 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
667 up, 789 down and 506 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.10 million
shares, down from 187.31 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 170.20 million shares.
   Analysts said it was not surprising to see the market run into
some resistance after its sharp rise over the past four weeks.
   Interest rates showed spotty increases in the credit markets,
helping to dampen the mood of stock traders.
   Brokers also noted that weakness in blue chips often occurs
after they have been driven higher, as they were late Friday, by
computer program trades related to a set of expiring stock index
options or futures.
   Aside from those technical forces, analysts said hopes remained
high on Wall Street that interest rates would turn downward before
long.
   An increase last Thursday in key West German interest rates sent
a brief jolt through the stock market. But it quickly recovered as
traders concluded that the Federal Reserve wouldn't take any
similar action.
   Syntex fell 2} to 44{. The stock rose sharply Friday on
speculation that F. Hoffmann-LaRoche &amp; Co. might be preparing to
make a bid for the company.
   But those expectations died down today when Hoffmann-La Roche
announced an internal restructuring plan.
   Sears Roebuck rose } to 46|. The company reported first-quarter
earnings of 70 cents a share, against operating profits of 43 cents
in the comparable period last year.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down [ at 34|; Merck, down 1 at 67}; General Electric,
down ] at 48, and Philip Morris, down ] at 125[.
   International Business Machines, which raised its dividend, was
unchanged at 113{.
   McGraw-Hill climbed 4 to 81\. Traders cited revived rumors and
speculation about a possible takeover or restructuring.
   Terdata lost 1 to 16\ in the over-the-counter market. Late
Friday the company reported sharply lower operating earnings for
its latest quarter.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $7.17 billion, or 0.24
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .41 to 172.49.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.34 to 356.15, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down .92 at 308.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

<TEXT>
   Shareholders of United Technologies Corp.,
a major U.S. defense contractor, rejected moves Monday to pull the
corporation out of South Africa and to look into company hiring
practices in Northern Ireland.
   The shareholders also rejected a call for an annual list of
names of top company leaders with former ties to government.
   Voting at their annual meeting, held this year at the Peabody
Hotel in Memphis, the shareholders supported management on all
issues raised at the gathering.
   The shareholders overwhelmingly approved the election of 11
members of the corporation's board of directors and approved an
employee incentive plan offering stock options to top company
managers.
   Robert F. Daniell, United Technologies' chairman and chief
executive officer, said the company enjoyed a good year in 1988.
   ``We positioned ourself for a very healthy future,'' he said.
   The company's Pratt &amp; Whitney division has a backlog of orders
for commercial aircraft engines worth $8.4 billion and is launched
on a program to reduce costs 30 percent by 1992, Daniell said.
   Profits for the company's Sikorsky helicopters increased in 1988
after a difficult period the previous year. And the Otis elevator
and Carrier air conditioner divisions also recorded strong sales,
he said.
   United Technologies' automotive division, he said, had its
fourth year of growth in a row.
   ``(The division) has an average of almost $70 worth of equipment
on every car you see,'' Daniell said.
   One resolution, which also has failed at previous shareholder
meetings, sought to divest the company of its elevator plant
employing about 1,100 workers in South Africa.
   A companion resolution sought to ban the company from doing
business with government agencies in South Africa.
   United Technologies is opposed to South African policies of
racial separation, but the company can do more to oppose apartheid
by staying in the country than by leaving, Daniell said.

<HEAD>Exxon Chief: 10 Years From Now You'll See `Nothing' of Valdez Oil
Goo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp.'s chief executive predicts that
remnants of the Valdez oil slick will vanish within 10 years
because of cleanup efforts, a comeback by Mother Nature and
evaporation of the leftover sludge.
   In an interview in the May 8 edition of Fortune Magazine, which
went on sale on most newsstands Monday, Lawrence Rawl also says the
largest U.S. oil company could have controlled up to half the spill
ifit had received approval from Coast Guard and Alaskan authorities
to dump chemical dispersants by air.
   Rawl also rejected criticism of Exxon's behavior and his lack of
public visibility in the days after one of its tankers crashed into
an underwater reef off the Alaskan coast March 24, spewing more
than 240,000 barrels of oil into Prince William Sound, the worst
spill in U.S. history.
   ``You're damned if you do and damned if you don't,'' Rawl said
in the interview. ``I concluded that we were going to be up to our
butts in alligators right here.''
   Exxon has said it will clean up the mess, which has devastated
the area around Valdez and led to congressional calls for tighter
regulatory control over oil company access to the huge reserves in
the nation's largest state.
   Rawl declined to predict how long the cleanup would take or what
it would cost the company, but he told the magazine he's seen other
larger spill cleanups that have been ``relatively inexpensive
because the environment has just come right back.''
   Asked what reporters will find if they return to Valdez in 10
years, Rawl said: ``Nothing. I would think they can return to
Valdez a lot sooner than 10 years from now. I don't think they will
find much in terms of environmental damage.''
   Rawl said one reason he was optimistic about the cleanup is
``we're going to put a hell of an effort on it.''
   He also said ``oil evaporates and it oxidizes. We can pick a lot
of it up. It is surprising, but in World War II we lost 16 times
more oil off the East Coast of the U.S. in the early months of 1942
when your tankers were torpedoed, and there was no permanent damage
to the shoreline.''
   Rawl said Exxon had been ready to dump chemical dispersants on
the spewing oil shortly after the accident, but ``the basic problem
we ran into was that we had environmentalists advising the Alaskan
Department of Environmental Conservation that the dispersant could
be toxic.''
   He said the consequent delay to load planes full of the
dispersant to dump on the oil was one of the main reasons the
public perceived the oil giant as acting slowly and irresponsibly.
   ``When you get 240,000 barrels of oil on the water, you cannot
get it all up,'' Rawl said. ``But we could have kep

percent of the oil from ending up on the beach somewhere.''

<HEAD>Rain In Corn Belt Triggers Plunge In Corn, Soybean Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Weekend showers in one of the driest parts of the Corn Belt
triggered a steep sell-off of corn and soybean futures Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade, more than offsetting the sharp gains of
the previous session.
   Oats also closed lower but wheat futures gained slightly on
continued dry weather in Kansas.
   On other markets, energy futures plunged; precious metals
advanced; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to 2{ cents higher with the contract
for delivery in May at $4.15} a bushel; corn was 6\ cents to 7{
cents lower with May at $2.69 a bushel; oats were 6\ cents to 6}
cents lower with May at $1.96\ a bushel; soybeans were 11{ cents to
17{ cents lower with May at $7.44{ a bushel.
   Severe thunderstorms occurred in western Illinois and eastern
Iowa over the weekend but brought little relief to the rest of the
Midwest, where corn planting has begun and soybean growers are
preparing to plant.
   ``The coverage was probably less than 20 to 25 percent of each
state, but it was enough to create a negative atmosphere this
morning'' in the grain markets, said Mickey Luth, a soybean analyst
in Chicago with Shearson Lehmann Hutton Inc.
   In a six-to-10-day forecast issued after the close, the National
Weather Service predicted normal temperatures and normal ainfall in
the Midwest early next week. The weather service called for
continued above-normal temperatures in the Great Plains,
threatening further deterioration of the drought-stressed Kansas
wheat crop.
   Corn and soybean prices also were pressured Monday by heavy
farmer selling of old-crop supplies over the weekend following last
week's rally. May soybeans had surged 12{ cents a bushel on Friday
and corn had gained 2{ cents to 5{ cents.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, most unleaded gasoline and
heating-oil contracts finished down the permitted daily limit of 2
cents a gallon amid disappointment over an Environmental Protection
Agency decision delaying the expected date of Massachusetts' switch
to a less-polluting gasoline standard.
   The lower-pollution gasoline is more expensive to produce.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 54 cents to 79 cents
lower with June at $20.61 a barrel; heating oil was 1.82 cents to 2
cents lower with May at 51.81 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
1.93 cents to 2 cents lower with May at 72.23 cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures posted strong gains on New York's
Commodity Exchange on buying partly inspired by the gold market's
resistance to selling below about $383 a troy ounce for spot
delivery.
   ``No matter what they tried, they weren't able to get it lower,
so they had to turn it around at some point and take the path of
less resistance _ take it higher,'' said Richard Levine, vice
president of the precious metals and foreign exchange group at
Elders Futures Inc. in New York.
   Gold settled $2.80 to $2.90 higher with June at $391 a troy
ounce; silver was 6.8 cents to 8.4 cents higher with May at $5.833
a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
with selling inspired by expectations for increasing supplies of
slaughter-ready cattle into the summer. Those perceptions were
bolstered by Friday's Agriculture Department quarterly
cattle-on-feed report, which showed 3 percent more cattle being
fattened for slaughter as of April 1 than on the same date a year
earlier.
   Strong cash markets boosted near-month pork futures but prices
for deferred delivery slipped on expectations of greater supplies
in the months ahead.
   Live cattle settled .65 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June
at 70.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .27 cent lower to .08
cent higher with May at 76.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .13
cent lower to .18 cent higher with June at 45.67 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .17 cent lower to .23 cent higher with May
at 31.45 cents a pound.

<TEXT>
   Bond prices drifted in a narrow range Monday,
finishing little changed as traders appeared to be awaiting further
evidence on the economy and the likely direction of interest rates.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond finished unchanged
compared with late Friday and its yield held at 8.98 percent.
   Market analysts said trading was light in the absence of
market-moving news developments and in advance of several economic
reports due later this week, starting Tuesday with data on durable
goods orders for March.
   Later this week, the government expects to report its
preliminary estimate of first-quarter growth in the gross national
product.
   In recent weeks, several reports have indicated the economy may
be slowing. But last week's increase in interest rates by the West
German central bank has made some traders fearful of a global trend
toward higher rates, a development that would depress bond prices.
   Meanwhile, the Treasury Department sold $7.2 billion in new
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.66 percent, up
from 8.57 percent last week. Another $7.2 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 8.72 percent, up
from 8.59 percent last week.
   The rates were the highest since April 10, when three-month
bills sold for 8.71 percent and six-month bills averaged 8.78
percent.
   In the secondary market for outstanding Treasury securities,
prices of short-term and intermediate governments were off 1-32
point, while long-term issues gained as much as 1-32 point,
according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, lost 0.29 to 1,128.50.
   In corporate trading, industrials edged up. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, rose 0.27 to 302.59.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 5-32 point to 9125-32. The average
yield to maturity fell to 7.63 percent from 7.64 percent late
Friday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.99 percent as the
discount rose 6 basis points to 8.69 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 9.14 percent as the discount rose 5 basis points to
8.64 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 9.34 percent as the
discount rose 2 basis points to 8.63 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, traded at 9~ percent, up from 913-16 percent late Thursday.

   The Air Force said Monday it had awarded
contracts to two competing teams of companies to determine how a
new jet fighter they are designing can be modified for use by the
Navy as well.
   The two contracts, each worth $50 million and awarded by the Air
Force on behalf of the Navy, are part of a previously announced
cooperation program between the two services in which the Air Force
is developing a new jet fighter and the Navy is developing a new
ground-attack jet for the 21st century.

carriers as a replacement for the F-14 Tomcat, and the Navy's
Advanced Tactical Aircraft is to be used by Air Force tactical
bombing squadrons.
   The two teams competing on the Advanced Tactical Fighter include
Lockheed Corp. and General Dynamics Corp., and Northrop Corp. and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. One of those teams is to be selected in
1991 to build the plane.
   The contracts awarded Monday are designed to allow the Air Force
contractors ``to identify the changes which are necessary to meet
the Navy's unique (aircraft) carrier suitability and mission
requirements ...''
   ``Some of the changes required to make the Navy variant
carrier-suitable include adding a wing fold, strengthening the
landing gear, adding a nose tow and arresting hook and a high-lift
system to make approach speed and attitude compatible with carrier
launches and landings ...,'' the Air Force added.
   While the Air Force was responsible for awarding the contracts,
the Navy said Monday it was funding the work.

   Energy futures prices plunged Monday amid new
reports of rising oil production and possible new sources of
imported gasoline.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
U.S. grade of crude oil, fell 71 cents a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, closing the day at $20.61. Other contract
months closed as much as 79 cents lower.
   Analysts said a report shortly after midday EDT that some
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were
boosting production to take advantage of rising crude prices
triggered a sell-off.
   Ed Ryan, energy analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said the
market had been ``nervously quiet'' until then.
   ``When the statement came from OPEC that it was increasing its
production, that triggered profit-taking,'' Ryan said.
   OPEC is believed to be producing about 20.5 million barrels a
day, 2 million above its self-imposed quota. Since it established
the quota last November to boost world oil prices, crude prices
have risen more than 60 percent.
   Many investors also were jittery in the absence of new
information about the resumption of North Sea oil production after
last week's gas explosion.
   News of the accident on Tuesday sent crude prices soaring more
than $3 a barrel to a three-year high. The accident disrupted the
flow of Brent crude through a major pipeline, which affected the
production of at least 500,000 barrel.
   The North Sea disruption compounded fears of an already tight
gasoline supply situation at the onset of the driving season.
Analysts said a decision Friday by the Environmental Protection
Agency giving Massachusetts until June to impose new higher octane
regulations also helped soften prices.
   In addition, they said that rumors circulating in the market
about possible foreign gasoline supplies also contributed to the
decline.
   ``We heard that new deliveries are coming in from Latin
America,'' said John Hill, an energy broker with Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures. ``Gasoline that would normally go to Europe is
coming here because prices are so high here.''
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline
for May delivery dropped 1.93 cents to 72.23 cents a gallon, with
most other contracts down 2 cents. Heating oil for May slid 1.82
cents to 51.81 cents a gallon, with other contracts 2 cents lower.

<HEAD>Goodyear, Uniroyal Goodrich Sales Up In First Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First-quarter sales increased at both
Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. and Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co., but
profits were down slightly at Goodyear, while Uniroyal Goodrich
trimmed its net loss compared with the first quarter of last year.
   In the three months ending March 31, Goodyear earned $94.5
million, or $1.64 a share, on sales of $2.6 billion, the company
said Monday.
   In the same period of 1988, Goodyear earned $95.3 million, or
$1.67 a share, on sales of $2.5 billion.
   Chairman Tom H. Barrett said results from the company's U.S.
tire operations improved and sales of industrial and chemical
products were strong.
   Uniroyal Goodrich had a net loss of $7 million in the 1989
quarter, compared with a loss of $7.6 million in the first quarter
of 1988. Sales for the quarter were $537.6 million, up from $482.8
million during the comparable period last year.
   The loss was produced by additional interest expense from last
year's restructuring, which wiped out operating profits, the
company said.
   ``This net loss reflects the expected seasonality of our tire
business and is not indicative of our anticipated full year
results,'' said Sheldon R. Salzman, company president and chief
operating officer.

<HEAD>Unocal Profit Drops 48 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unocal Corp. posted a 48 percent decline in
first-quarter profit, due mainly to accounting changes that
produced unusual gains in 1988's first quarter.
   Unocal also announced the election of Richard J. Stegemeier to
chairman of the board. Stegemeier, 61, also was re-elected
president and chief executive officer.
   For the first three months of 1989, Unocal's after-tax profit
totaled $87 million, or 75 cents a share, compared with $178
million, or $1.53 a share, in the 1988 first quarter.
   Revenue totaled $2.64 billion, up 14 percent from $2.32 billion
in the year-ago period.
   The Los Angeles-based oil company said its 1988 first-quarter
results included a $456 million cumulative gain from a change in
accounting procedures, which were partly offset by after-tax
charges of $322 million for write-downs.
   Without adjustments, first-quarter 1988 earnings were $44
million, or 38 cents per share, Unocal said.
   Stegemeier succeeds Fred L. Harley, 72, who announced his
retirement last June.
   Stegemeier said that rising crude oil prices helped boost
Unocal's exploration and production earnings, but they were
partially offset by lower net income in the company's refining and
marketing business.
   Capital expenditures for the quarter were $202 million, up from
$189 million for the first quarter of 1988, Unocal said.
   As of March 31, Unocal had reduced its debt to $4.33 billion,
down $275 million from the end of 1988. The company said it has now
paid down $1.8 billion since October 1985, when it incurred the
huge debt trying to evade a takeover attempt by T. Boone Pickens Jr.

   Boeing Co. posted an 18.4 percent earnings gain
and broke $4 billion in sales in the first quarter, management told
shareholders Monday at the company's annual meeting.
   Boeing predicted record sales for 1989 and defended its lagging
military business as it announced an increase in its dividend and a
3-for-2 stock split.
   Boeing's earnings rose to $161 million, or $1.05 a share, from
$136 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.9
percent to $4.001 billion from $3.64 billion.
   Chairman and chief executive officer Frank Shrontz told a full
house of
   A 45-cents-per-share cash dividend, 5 cents higher than last
year's dividend, will be payable June 9 to shareholders of record
on May 12, 1989.
   After the stock split, which will also take effect June 9 for
the same stockholders, the dividend per share will be 30 cents.
   ``I am convinced we are headed to a great corporate year in
1989,'' Frank Shrontz, the chairman and chief executive, told
shareholders.
   The company attributed the increase in first-quarter earnings to
higher sales volume and a reduction in research and development and
other expenses in commercial aircraft and computing.
   Shrontz said ``concern about aging aircraft is bound to be a
significant factor'' in the company's improved jet sales prospects
for this year.
   Boeing predicts overall sales of $22 billion for 1989, company
spokesman Tom Cole said.
   The company's firm backlog of orders, which totaled $59.3
billion as of March 1, 88 percent of it for commercial aircraft,
led the company to increase production rates of its 737, 747, 757
and 767 programs, Shrontz said. Firm backlogs at year-end 1988 were
$53.6 billion.
   Boeing's record year for profits was 1986, with $665 million on
sales of $16.3 billion. Last year, profits were $614 million.
   Boeing last declared a stock split in 1985, when the price hit
$68.75. Last year, Boeing increased the dividend per share to 40
cents, from 35 cents in 1987.

<HEAD>First Women's Bank Changes Name To Reflect Changing Times</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The First Women's Bank, which was founded in
1975 to give women equal opportunity in banking, has changed its
name to the First New York Bank for Business, the chairman
announced Monday.
   The new appellation reflects the bank's decision to expand into
middle market commercial lending and its belief that women are no
longer discriminated against by other banks, said Martin A. Simon,
the chairman.
   ``The mission that the bank had to specialize in women because
they didn't have equal opportunity became anachronistic because
everyone else was doing the same thing,'' he said.
   The First Women's Bank was never successful financially, he
said, because of its small capital base. Moreover, he said, it soon
became clear that there was no need for a bank that catered
exclusively to women.
   Simon joined the bank in December 1986 and led the
recapitalization effort that moved it from a financial institution
with $50 million in assets and 23 employees to $633 million in
assets and 189 employees.
   The bank's new target is the middle market in the New York
metropolitan area _ people or businesses that are looking for loans
of $1 million to $5 million, the chairman said.
   However, he said the bank's flagship branch located at Park
Avenue and 57th Street will retain The First Women's Bank banner to
demonstrate ``a caring and an affinity for women ... we intend to
foster.''
   Simon noted that half of the bank's senior management is made up
of women. ``Few banks, if any, can make that claim,'' he added.
   The name change will affect all of the bank's other branches
except for The First Children's Bank, which opened at F.A.O.
Schwarz in September 1988.

<TEXT>
   Each passing day of spring is giving automakers a
better picture of how the rest of their year is shaping up, and
there's speculation that it may not look as good as they'd planned.
   Mid-April sales figures by the eight U.S. automakers are due
Tuesday, and the industry has been looking for rebounding numbers.
   It is the first 10-day sales reporting period to feel the full
impact of incentive programs announced in late March and early
April by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   March and April normally herald the spring car-buying season,
but sales this past March were lower than expected. Automakers
responded with a number of new incentives, hoping to make customers
deals they couldn't refuse.
   Those hopes haven't necessarily become reality.
   Car and light truck sales during the first 10 days of April
appeared strong on paper, rising 28.3 percent over the same period
last year. Ford led the charge, boosting sales of its domestically
made cars by 47 percent. But those figures compared with
year-earlier numbers weakened when incentives expired at the end of
March 1988.
   Sales had rebounded by mid-April last year, meaning a
year-to-year comparison on Tuesday will be more valid.
   ``You're comparing it with a fairly strong period last year,''
analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said Monday.
   ``I guess you'd say they (incentives) are working but not as
well as they used to,'' he said. ``If that's so, mid-April sales
were better than the March rate, but not as good as early April.''
   Analyst Douglas Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York
agreed that April sales were critical for the industry.
   ``I'm holding my breath a little on this one,'' he said, adding
that he was watching interest rates particularly closely.
   ``If interest rates start to trend down, I think that would
alleviate some of the concern (among automakers) about the impact
of this particular (incentive) program, '' he said. ``It would
suggest that things will be easier in the next few months.
   ``If interest rates hang up here,'' Laughlin said, ``it may be a
source of concern for the industry.''
   One of the first places any industry concern would be noted is
in the companies' production schedules. GM, Ford and Chrysler held
to ambitious production levels through the first quarter of this
year, leading some analysts to speculate that production rates
would have to be changed later this year, especially at
model-changeover time in the third quarter.
   Ward's Automotive Reports, a weekly industry newsletter, said in
Monday editions that GM had cut its production schedule
significantly for June, July and August.

   Tyson Foods Inc., the nation's leading

increased 21 percent from a year earlier.
   Profit for the quarter ended April 1 totaled $21.7 million, or
34 cents a share, up $3.8 million from $17.9 million, or 28 cents a
share, in the year-ago quarter.
   Sales for the quarter totaled $534.9 million, compared with

   For the six months ended April 1, Tyson reported a profit of
$41.5 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $35.7 million, or
56 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales for the six
months totaled $1.04 billion, up from $900.9 million.
   Tyson, with headquarters in Springdale, is a leader in
production and marketing of pre-packaged, pre-cooked and
convenience poultry and other products.
   Tyson has proposed a $1.15 billion takeover of chicken processor
Holly Farms Corp., which Memphis-based Holly has resisted.

<TEXT>
   Police arrested at least 200 United Mine
Workers members Monday for blocking roads and mine entrances as the
union expanded its violence-marred strike against The Pittston Coal
Group.
   Although state police reported no violence, a local hospital
treated seven miners who said they were injured while being
arrested.
   The sitdown strike, which blocked traffic on state and county
roads in Dickenson County, led to a spontaneous parade in
Clintwood, with union supporters jamming the streets and courthouse
steps.
   ``They're not going to run these mines with scabs, and they're
not going to run these mines without us,'' said Marty Hudson, the
executive assistant to UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts.
   The UMW on Monday expanded its strike against Pittston to
temporarily include Westmoreland Coal Co., which it accused of
plotting to provide Pittston with 200,000 to 300,000 tons of coal
to fulfill contracts. Westmoreland has denied that charge.
   The 1,400 Pittston employees who have been on strike since April
5 in Virginia were joined on the picket lines at 12:01 a.m. Monday
by about 750 Westmoreland employees who are taking off three of the
10 ``memorial days'' _ or personal days _ allowed by their contract.
   UMW District 28 President Jackie Stump said union President
Richard Trumka called the three-day work stoppage at Westmoreland's
mines in the western tip of Virginia.
   ``Each and every company is going to be looked at whether or not
they're filling Pittston's orders,'' Stump said. ``If they are, we
consider it to be a conspiracy to break the union.''
   The Pittston employees in Virginia and 300 in West Virginia went
on strike April 5, accusing the company of unfair practices during
contract talks. The miners had been working without a contract
since February 1988.
   Hudson said about 300 miners Monday blocked the entrance to the
McClure mine in Dickenson County and about 200 blocked access to
the Lambert Fork mine in Russell County.
   About 800 to 1,000 blocked all three entrances to the Moss No. 3
coal preparation plant in Russell County.
   ``We're going to let our rear ends touch the asphalt and we're
not going to move,'' Hudson said. ``We're going to let the county
feed us a while.''
   Many strikers, preparing for their inevitable arrests, rid
themselves of all forms of identification to make it more difficult
for police to process them.
   At 6 a.m., state police began arresting union members who
blocked roads in Freemont and Clinchfield. The strikers were
charged with obstructing free passage, a misdemeanor, said Lt. J.D.
Willis of the Virginia State Police in Wytheville.
   Most were released on their own recognizance, but at least 24
had been jailed in the Dickenson County Jail, according to Sheriff
Avery Phipps.
   ``We don't know if there were actually any injuries,'' said
Trooper B.I Sparks of the Virginia State Police. ``There were some
complaints of injuries.''
   Doctors at the Dickenson County Medical Center in Clintwood
treated and released six miners with lacerations and bruises. A
seventh, suffering from blurred vision, was held.
   After miners blocked off two Virginia roads, state police
blocked off all roads into the areas in which the arrests were made
and turned back reporters.
   By late afternoon, while arrested miners were being processed in
the Duckenson County Courthouse, a spontaneous parade erupted in
the streets of Clintwood. Streets were jammed with cars festooned
with homemade signs of support for miners.
   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom and company
spokeswoman Susan Copeland did not immediately return phone calls
from The Associated Press on Monday.

   Divers located the bodies of two
maintenance workers killed Monday when an early morning explosion
rumbled through the underpinnings of Ford Motor Co.'s Rouge complex.
   The victims were identified as Billy Stiener, 27, of Redford and
John L. Hatch, in his early 50s, of Detroit, Ford spokesman John
Spelich said.
   The bodies were located at 7:30 p.m. Monday in a half-mile-long
portion of a utility tunnel that carries electric, water, steam and
compressed air services to several buildings at the 1,100-acre
facility.
   The tunnel, 7 to 8 feet in diameter, was flooded with 4 to 6
feet of water after the blast apparently ruptured a water pipe,
Spelich said.
   The blast tore gaping holes in parking lots, flipped cars, blew
windows from a three-story power substation and forced the company
to shut down a number of operations, including the Mustang
automobile assembly line.
   John Schultz, a driver for a bus company Ford contracts to carry
people around the huge complex, said he saw ``flames shooting 300
to 500 feet into the air for a short period of time'' shortly after
the 6:20 a.m. blast.
   There was no fire damage.
   Spelich said the two victims were employed by Doetsch Industrial
Services Inc. of Detroit. A woman answering the Doetsch telephone,
who refused to give her name, said the company has done maintenance
work at the Rouge complex for years.
   While the divers searched below, workers on the surface some
wearing masks and protective clothing, picked up and bagged debris
out of concern that asbestos, which had been used to wrap the steam
pipes, might escape into the air. The fibrous mineral has been
shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals. Spelich said workers
immediately watered down any areas which might have been affected
by airborne asbestos.
   About 6,500 first-shift employees at the complex were sent home
after the explosion. The afternoon shifts at the Mustang assembly
plant, a metal stamping plant and part of a glass-making operation
were told not to report for work, affecting about 2,500 workers,
Ford spokesman Jay Meisenhelder said.
   It wasn't clear how long any of the 16,000 workers at the
complex would be away from their jobs. The assembly plant has been
making about 46 Mustangs an hour recently, Spelich said.
   The Rouge complex, located in Dearborn a few miles west of the
Detroit city limits, includes steel-making and engine plants in
addition to the operations shut down by the blast.

   Laid-off workers at the Wall Street brokerage
L.F. Rothschild &amp; Co. have sued their former employer under the new
federal plant closing law, while three Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
employees have sued that investment house over its plans to sell
its retail brokerage business.
   The Rothschild employees claim they were dismissed without the
60 days' notice required under the law.
   A lawyer for the workers said Monday he did not know of any
other suits filed under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, which took effect Feb. 4. The workers were laid
off March 10.
   Though the act is known popularly as the plant closing law, it
applies to any company with at least 100 employees in all and at
least 50 at one site. Such firms must give workers 60 days' notice
of a shutdown or mass layoffs.
   The lawyer, Jeffrey G. Smith, said L.F. Rothschild laid off
about 250 workers at its Manhattan headquarters without warning.
The suit, seeking back pay and punitive damages, was filed Friday
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by seven former employees as a
class action.
   The suit said Rothschild was one of the 20 largest brokerage
houses in the nation, with more than $300 million in capital,
before the October 1987 stock market crash.
   The firm suffered heavy losses in the crash and was purchased in
June by a subsidiary of Franklin Savings Association, a savings and
loan based in Ottawa, Kan. But it continued to lose money, and the
layoffs ensued.
   In a letter announcing the layoffs, Rothschild told its
employees the plant closing law did not apply because the company
had been ``pursuing a realistic opportunity'' to have a lender bail
it out and avert the layoffs.
   Smith said the law did offer such an exemption, on grounds that
a layoff notice would scare off potential lenders.
   But he said in this case the bailout apparently was being
considered by Franklin, the parent company. Smith said that would
not qualify for an exemption because Franklin already was aware of
Rothschild's condition.
   Kevin Hoffman, Rothschild's attorney, declined to discuss the
case, saying the company would respond in court.
   He did say Rothschild gave severance pay to the workers. But
Smith said the law requires notification regardless.
   In the Drexel case, the class-action suit filed Monday by the
three workers charges Drexel's top managers with breach of contract
and violations of their fiduciary duties because of the plans to
sell the brokerage division.
   The suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan,
contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions
of dollars because they will be forced to sell their Drexel stock
for far below its true value.
   The price of the stock is based on book value. The suit did not
disclose the firm's book value.
   According to the suit, Drexel has understated the book value of
its assets, including warrants and options it has received in some
deals in lieu of partial payment of fees.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder told The New York Times that the
firm had not studied the suit and had no comment.
   Drexel annouced plans last week for a major restructuring that
involves the sale of the brokerage unit and the elimination of
about one-third of Drexel's work force. The restructuring was
prompted in part by bad publicity due to the investigation of
securities fraud at the investment house.
