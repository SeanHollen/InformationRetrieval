   A school cafeteria wall collapsed during a
severe thunderstorm Thursday, toppling concrete blocks onto
lunching pupils and killing seven of them, authorities said.
Eighteen others were injured, four critically.
   ``It was a very quick thing and there wasn't anything anybody
could do about it because it happened all at once,'' said Donald
Presutti, mayor of the city of Newburgh, about five miles east of
the school and 60 miles north of New York City.
   From 113 to 125 students in first, second and third grades were
in the cafeteria when the storm struck East Coldenham Elementary
School about 12:30 p.m., said Newburgh Police Chief John Kulisek.
   ``You are talking about huge concrete blocks that fell on top of
the kids,'' state police Lt. Robert Hughes said.
   The storm system was the same one that moved through the South
on Wednesday, spinning off tornadoes that killed 17 people in
Alabama.
   State Police and survivors said they believed the school was hit
by a tornado, but the National Weather Service said it could not
confirm that until investigators went to the scene.
   The seven dead students were identified Thursday night by New
York State Police as Amy Innis, 8; Joanna Lichtler, 7; Larae
Litchhult, 8; Peter Orsino, 8; Charles J. Scotto, 7; Adam J.
Soltis, 7 and Maria J. Stuhmer, 8.
   At St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh, two children were in
critical condition, three were in guarded condition and four were
listed as satisfactory, spokeswoman Debra Sgroe said. Two others
were treated and released.
   A 7-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy taken to Westchester
County Medical Center in Valhalla were in critical condition with
injuries to the head and elsewhere, said hospital spokesman Barry
Bowman.
   One child was in serious condition at Cornwall Hospital, one was
in fair condition and one was treated and released, a spokesperson
said. Two others were treated and released from two other hospitals.
   Sgroe said several residents came to St. Luke's Hospital and
offered to donate blood. Crisis counselors were meeting with the
families of the dead and injured at the hospital, she said.
   ``There are a lot of broken legs, broken ankles, arms, some head
contusions, various other traumas to the body,'' the mayor said.
``The wall was blown down and they were in having lunch. It was
right during lunch time.''
   Only the center section of the wall collapsed. Cinder blocks
extended about 20 feet up the wall and were topped by 5 to 7 feet
of windows. The windows were blown out and the blocks toppled into
the cafeteria where students were sitting at tables.
   ``I saw a tornado come and I saw everything flying down,'' said
one youngster, Brian Schwartz. ``It looked like a tornado. All
kinds of glass fell down and these little things, papers that were
hanging on the windows, came down. I didn't even look back.''
   Bill Larkin, a state Assemblyman whose district includes
Montgomery, said he believed a tornado hit the school. He noted
that a willow tree was uprooted in the yard of a home next door to
the school, about 100 yards away.
   ``That building has been there since 1961. If it had hit the
house instead of the building, it would have torn the house
apart,'' Larkin said. There was little other damage in the area,
with only a few trees knocked over and some branches downed.
   A nearby resident said he helped firefighters pull bricks and
other rubble off children.
   ``The second kid I had in my arms wanted to go to his mom, and
he was crying,'' Vincent Sitko said.
   Police, firefighters and rescue workers worked in the cafeteria
by spotlight Thursday night to clear debris and shore up the wall.
Classes were cancelled for Friday throughout the Valley Central
School District.
   Christopher Carpenter, a spokesman for the state Education
Department, said the state would send a structural engineer and an
architect to the site Friday to determine what happened. Ciro
DiLorenzo, building inspector for the town of Newburgh, said there
was too much damage to determine immediately if the building was
structurally sound.
   The storm system roared up the Atlantic Coast on Thursday,
accompanied by tornadoes, high wind and heavy rain. At least one
person was killed in New Jersey by the storm.
   Utility workers clocked winds at 58 mph in the Newburgh area
during the storm.
   The weather service had posted a tornado watch Thursday for
large parts of the East Coast from Maryland to New England,
including the Newburgh area and metropolitan New York.
   A tornado warning, a more urgent advisory, was posted for
Westchester County, one of the counties between New York and
Newburgh.

   Negotiators for the Nicaraguan government and
the Contra rebels met for four hours Thursday night and were unable
to narrow their differences on terms for restoring a cease fire.
   Spokesmen for both sides said the principal sticking point was
the refusal by the Contras to agree to a Sandinista demand for the
withdrawal of rebel forces inside Nicaragua to base camps in
Honduras.
   The Sandinistas are linking their consent to a cease fire to a
rebel withdrawal while the Contras are insisting on maintaining
their present positions once a truce goes into effect.
   One positive sign after the talks recessed was the absence of
kind of strident criticism of each other's position that
characterized their public comments 24 hours earlier.
   The talks began on Nov. 9 and will resume Friday morning.
   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, an official ``witness'' to the
discussions, left the talks Wednesday night to keep an appointment
elsewhere. He said he rejoined the negotiations Thursday night on
orders from the Holy See. After his departure Wednesday, the
atmosphere for the discusssions deteriorated markedly.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros told reporters he had noted a
``hardening'' of the government's position on the cease-fire.
   The chief rebel negotiator, Col. Enrique Bermudez, said the
Sandinistas showed no interest in agreeing to a cease-fire as a
first step in a confidence building process.
   His Sandinista counterpart, Vice-Foreign Minister Victor Hugo
Tinoco, said that for a ``real and effective cease-fire to take
place, the Contras should go back to their camps in Honduras.''
   There are an estimated 5,000 rebels inside Nicaraguan territory.
   Earlier, Bermudez said that once a cease-fire was agreed to,
details of the duties and makeup of a verification commission to
monitor compliance could be worked out.
   The talks are being mediated by officials from the United
Nations and the Organization of American States, one of whom said
after the 10 p.m. recess that the negotiations were ``inching
along.''
   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega suspended the cease-fire 17
days ago, citing what he said were repeated terrorist activities by
the Contra forces.
   Reviving the truce is considered an important goal because
national elections are set for Nicaragua on Feb. 25.
   The Contra delegation stunned the Sandinistas Wednesday night
when Bermudez called for a weeklong recess in the talks just when
government negotiators said an agreement appeared to be within
reach.
   Tinoco told a news conference Thursday that the rebel action
``shows clearly the Contras have no interest in peace, no interest
in a cease-fire, no interest in demobilization.''
   But Matamoros denied that significant progress had been made
Wednesday, asserting that statements to the contrary ``were not
accurate'' and that the Sandinista negotiators showed a lack of
``flexibility'' in the discussions.
   The Contras proposed on Wednesday that the talks be reconvened
in a week, possibly in Guatemala, but Bermudez seemed to back away
from that stand Thursday by calling for a resumption of the talks
in early evening.

   One day after hearing Solidarity Leader Lech
Walesa appeal for economic aid, the House on Thursday approved a
three-year aid plan authorizing $846.5 million for Poland and $91.5
million for Hungary.
   The compromise measure, drawn up by House-Senate negotiators,
was sent to the Senate, where it hit a snag when Republicans
complained that safeguards they added to prevent misuse of the
money had been removed.
   One such amendment would bar the conversion of U.S. aid to
military assistance to Nicaragua or Cuba.
   After hours of consultations, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, stopped consideration of the measure and sent it
to a formal conference with negotiators from both chambers.
   In the version passed by the House, negotiators had added to the
authorization bill a $200 million standby trade credit insurance
program _ opposed by Senate Republicans _ to help Poland spur its
foreign trade. The measure was not included in the $738 million aid
package passed by the Senate earlier this week.
   The House voted, 372-47, to strip from the bill unrelated tax
provisions added by Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   In its final version, the bill authorizes $200 million to help
Poland shore up the value of its currency wich has been battered by
inflation.
   A private enterprise fund of $240 million also was authorized to
help Poland discard its centralized communist economic system and
move to a free-market economy.
   Also authorized for Poland are $125 million in food aid, $4
million in labor aid, $5 million for technical skills training, $3
million to introduce the Peace Corps, $6 million for education and
cultural exchanges and $30 million to retrofit a power plant at
Krakow with clean-coal technology.
   Also, $5 million for scholarships, $6 million to help Poland
build democratic institutions. $10 million to begin an
environmental cleanup, $4 million in medical aid, $3 million for a
technology development program, and $5.5 million to improve science
and technology.
   Authorized for Hungary are $60 million to establish a private
enterprise fund, $6 million for democratic institutions, $5 million
for technical training, $3 million for the Peace Corps, $6 million
for education and cultural exchanges, $5 million for scholarships,
$1 million for labor assistance, $3 million for a technology
development program and $2.5 million to improve science and
technology.

<TEXT>
   The Senate late Thursday approved a 22-month
extension of the U.S. Civil Rights Commission that would head off
the panel's automatic demise at the end of this month.
   The measure now goes back to the House, which had passed a
six-month extension a day earlier and was ready to accept the
longer-term bill, said a spokesman for Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who
worked out the compromise.
   The spokesman, David Carle, said the 22-month extension was a
middle ground between Democrats who wanted only a short-term
measure while they waited to see whom President Bush appoints to
the panel in the coming weeks and the White House's desire for a
six-year bill.
   The commission won praise in the 1960s for holding hearings
across the South and recommending bold civil rights legislation.
But during the Reagan administration its effectiveness has eroded
and the panel has been consumed by internal bickering. Congress has
slashed funding for the commission.

<HEAD>North Dakota's Sunday Shopping Law Faces Challenge</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</HEAD>

   Christmas music fills the air and ornaments
decorate the halls of North Dakota's largest mall, but shoppers are
talking more about a court challenge to the nation's strictest
Sunday closing laws.
   The Greater North Dakota Association, the state's chamber of
commerce, announced this week it will go to court to have those
laws declared unconstitutional.
   The so-called blue laws, rooted in religious tradition, have
been on the books since North Dakota became a state 100 years go.
In 1889, Sunday sales were restricted to meats and fish if sold
before 10 a.m., and to grocery items such as medicine, milk and
cigars.
   The laws have been relaxed over the years, including a provision
exempting tourist attractions. In 1985, the state allowed grocery
stores to open under the operation of a manager and no more than
six workers.
   Bismarck lawyer Orell Schmitz said it's time for another change.
   ``The constitution is not ... a document that's cast in stone.
It changes, and has to change, to reflect the times as they
change,'' Schmitz said Tuesday.
   Mark Sinner, owner of one of the 114 stores and restaurants in
the West Acres Mall, North Dakota's largest, said he was encouraged
by the association's announcement.
   ``I've always thought that it's very discriminatory for them to
tell me that I can't open on Sunday but other (stores) can,'' he
said.
   ``There's no doubt we'd fill the mall on Sunday,'' added Sinner,
the nephew of Gov. George Sinner.
   Some mall employees would rather have Sunday off than make more
money.
   ``I'm a student and I like to have my Sundays off to study and
do research,'' said Linda Perry, a part-time employee. She
acknowledged, however, that she shops on Sundays in supermarkets
and convenience stores that remain open.
   Eight states have some form of Sunday sales laws, according to
the National Retail Merchants Association. But most of the major
ones have been struck down by the courts.
   Alabama, South Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia restrict
liquor sales on Sundays and Louisiana restricts the sale of cars.
In Maine, small specialty stores are exempt from Sunday closing
laws, and all stores are allowed to open on Sundays between
Thanksgiving and Christmas. In Missouri, counties have the option
of restricting Sunday sales.
   Patty Smith, a mother of two who traveled the 25 miles to Fargo
from Amenia to shop on Tuesday, said that Sunday should be a day
for families.
   ``I know they say it will generate more business for the stores
and revenue for the state, but that has to be weighed against the
effects on families,'' Smith said.
   Others say on religious grounds that Sunday should be a day of
rest for retail workers. Jeff Hickman, a restaurant manager and
president of the West Acres Merchants Association, disagrees.
   ``Opposing it on religious or moral grounds doesn't make it as
far as I'm concerned because you can buy a Playboy on Sunday but
you can't buy a Bible,'' he said.
   Dale Anderson, head of the Greater North Dakota Association,
said the civil lawsuit will ask the court to allow any business to
open on Sunday, including liquor stores and bars.
   The planned court challenge comes as some cities have begun
exploiting a loophole that allows stores to open if a ``community
festival'' is declared.
   Fargo was the first to declare such a festival last month,
granting stores authority to open on Sundays between Thanksgiving
and Christmas as part of its ``Merry Prairie Christmas''
celebration. But Cass County States Attorney Robert Hoy has said
his office will prosecute businesses that operate on Sundays.
   Vince Lindstrom, head of the Fargo-Moorhead Convention and
Visitors Bureau, said he hoped the association would seek a court
order barring authorities from arresting store owners who choose to
open during the festival.
   Attorneys have yet to decide when or where the civil lawsuit
will be filed, or to choose a defendant. They said Tuesday it could
be filed against an assortment of government bodies.
   Schmitz said he hoped the court system would handle the lawsuit
speedily, ``so that we can get it resolved once and for all, as to
what is the status of Sunday shopping in North Dakota.
   ``Because right now,'' Schmitz added, ``it's in utter chaos.''

   Two years ago he wore tailored suits and
dined at the Harvard Club. Today, Wall Street felon Ivan Boesky is
said to eat at Mister Donut and wear a bushy beard and long,
unkempt hair like Howard Hughes.
   Boesky, the focus of Wall Street's insider trading scandals, is
on a three-week furlough from a minimum-security federal prison
camp in Lompoc, Calif.
   The owner of a local convenience store said Wednesday that a man
identified as Boesky in a front-page photo in the tabloid New York
Post ``looked like a homeless person'' and asked about the sugar
and salt content of foods during a weekend shopping visit.
   The newspaper reported that Boesky is staying with friends in
the Stamford area during his release.
   The man in the photo, wearing unkempt, long white hair and a
beard, was dressed in sweat pants and running shoes and carried a
gym bag and a full change of clothing.
   Pete Tournas, 22, owner of For Your Convenience near downtown
Stamford, said the man shopped at the store two or three times over
the weekend. But Tournas said he didn't know who he was until
seeing the newspaper photos.
   On one trip, the man believed to be Boesky bought $45 worth of
groceries and asked questions about the sugar content of some
cereals and the salt in other foods, Tournas said. He ``seemed to
be on a health kick,'' Tournas said.
   Boesky, whose fortune once was estimated at $200 million, was
accompanied by a friend who paid for the groceries, he said.
   ``He was a real friendly guy, a good-natured type,'' Tournas
said. ``But he stuck out like a sore thumb.''
   Boesky, 52, applied for and was granted the furlough, which
began last Thursday, prison officials said. He is due back at
Lompoc, where he is serving a three-year term, around the end of
the month.
   Boesky attorney Leon Silverman on Wednesday declined to discuss
his client's release.
   In Stamford, Boesky also supposedly was spotted in a Mister
Donut coffee shop, across the street from the Yeshiva Bais
Binyomin, a Jewish academy for Talmudic research.
   Boesky is known to have developed an interest in Judaic studies
and had endowed a $20 million library at the Jewish Theological
Seminary in New York City.
   He was rumored to have attended night classes at the Stamford
academy over the weekend, but the head of the Yeshiva denied Boesky
had been there and said he knew of no plans for Boesky to attend.
   Boesky's rabbi in New York City, Wolfe Kelman, also declined to
comment.
   Boesky, who owns a 75-acre estate north of New York City, is
eligible for release from prison next April. In prison, Boesky
reportedly has been working on a cleanup crew, lifting weights and
growing the beard.
   Three years ago Tuesday, Boesky paid $100 million to the
Securities and Exchange Commission and agreed to plead guilty to
one criminal count to settle charges related to a large insider
trading network.
   Boesky is cooperating with the government and still is expected
to testify against former junk bond financier Michael Milken, whose
trial is set for next year.
   Legal experts said they expect defense lawyers in the Milken
case to try to use the Post photos, in which the subject resembles
the late eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes, to discredit Boesky.
But they were expected to have a tough time getting them admitted
in court.
   ``If he looks weird or erratic it's the kind of information a
good defense attorney will want before a jury,'' said Harvey J.
Goldschmid, a Columbia University securities law professor.

   Two North Koreans studying in East
Germany defected by escaping through one of the new openings in the
Berlin Wall, the Foreign Ministry announced today.
   The ministry said the two _ Chang Yong Chul, 24, and Chun Chul
Wu, 23 _arrrived in Seoul on Wednesday aboard a Korean Air flight.
   After entering West Berlin over the weekend, the two students
went to the South Korean consulate general and asked for asylum,
officials said.
   The two were the first North Koreans to defect to South Korea
through the Berlin Wall since East Germany opened its borders last
week.
   Two North Korean students in Czechoslovakia defected to South
Korea in February and two North Korean students in Poland came to
South Korea in May.
   Communist North Korea is one of the most closed societies in the
world, rarely allowing its citizens to travel overseas.

   A Marine Corps honor guard and a crowd of 45
mourners paid homage to the late actor Tyrone Power on Wednesday,
the 31st anniversary of his death.
   ``His presence has been very significant in my life,'' said
Taryn Power, one of the late actor's two daughters, who was among
those gathered at Hollywood Memorial Park Cemetery. The crowd
``always amazes me,'' she added.
   The Marine guard honored Power's World War II service.
   Power, star of such films as ``Witness for the Prosecution,''
``The Razor's Edge'' and ``Captain from Castille,'' died of a heart
attack at the age of 45. He collapsed on a movie set in Spain in

   Three thousand people mobbed the cemetery when he was buried in
a white marble tomb, and there has been an annual memorial ever

<HEAD>Study: Strict Low-Salt Diet May Be Harmful for Some</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salt, long believed a cause of high blood
pressure, may have the opposite effect on some people on strict
low-salt diets, a study says. But other doctors insist it's still
better to keep your hands off the shaker.
   Dr. Brent Egan, director of the hypertension unit at the Medical
College of Wisconsin, said his study suggests that strictly
limiting salt intake could be bad for people with normal blood
pressure.
   He said he believes that the American Heart Association's
suggestion of limiting daily salt consumption to 7 grams, or about
1{ teaspoons, is safe. But he said further study is necessary
before more stringent rules are adopted for the general population.
   ``I think there are some people who are harmed by severe to
moderate salt restriction, at least in the short term,'' said Egan,
who based his findings on a diet experiment.
   But, he cautioned, ``I am not suggesting that the population
should run out and shake salt on their food.''
   Egan presented his findings Wednesday at the heart association's
annual meeting, where his conclusions were immediately questioned
by other high blood pressure experts.
   ``I would challenge the notion that blood pressures went up
because they went on low-salt diets,'' said Dr. Richard Grimm of
the University of Minnesota. ``It may just be the normal variation
in blood pressure. We haven't seen anything like that in our
studies.''
   An estimated 60 million Americans have high blood pressure. It
is a major underlying cause of heart attacks and strokes.
   Large population studies have clearly linked salt with blood
pressure. They show that, in general, people's blood pressures rise
as their salt intake increases.
   Other factors associated with high blood pressure are obesity,
low potassium consumption and heavy use of alcohol.
   Public health experts have recommended that all Americans watch
their salt intake, even though many people are not sensitive to the
bad effects of salt. Some said they feared Egan's findings might
make people think widely accepted dietary rules are potentially
harmful.
   ``It would be a big mistake for us to say that the modest
reduction of salt that the American Heart Association recommends
would be detrimental to anyone's health,'' said Dr. Theodore
Kotchen of West Virginia University.
   In Egan's study, 27 men in their 30s went on alternating
high-and low-salt diets. During the low-salt phase, half of the
men's blood pressures went down, and half rose.
   Among those whose pressures went up, the researchers noticed
that their levels of low-density lipoprotein, the so-called bad
cholesterol, also increased, as did their levels of insulin and
uric acid.
   Egan said that when physicians put patients on low-salt diets,
they should monitor these people to make sure that the regimens do
more good than harm.
   Among other studies presented Wednesday:
   _Researchers from several institutions presented findings on
miniature ultrasound devices that can be passed through the blood
vessels to give a ``fantastic voyage'' view of arteries and the
heart. They said this unique view of the body should help them
diagnose problems and select and guide the instruments to correct
them.
   _Doctors from the University of Oslo in Norway found that people
with large numbers of blood-clotting cells called platelets are at
unusually high risk of death from heart disease. They followed
2,014 middle-aged men for 13 years and found that the 25 percent
with the highest platelet counts had about double the death rate of
the other men.
   _Doctors from Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston said an
experimental test appears to spot the earliest stages of
cholesterol's damage to the blood vessels. They found that when
exposed to the nerve chemical acetylcholine, healthy blood vessels
expand, but if they are damaged, they contract. They hope to use
the test to spot early signs of trouble in heart transplant
recipients, who are at high risk for artery disease.

   The body of a 61-year-old man lay undiscovered for
at least five days in a toilet cubicle at a top London hospital,
the hospital said.
   A cleaner found the body of William Frost on Tuesday afternoon
in a busy outpatients' bathroom at St. Bartholomew's Hospital,
operational manager Ian Johnson said Wednesday.
   Frost died ``five or six days'' ago, and the results of an
autopsy Wednesday were not immediately available, Johnson said.
Frost was at the hospital for an X-ray but apparently died before
he was examined, Johnson said.
   The hospital has begun an investigation into how their cleaners
operate, and an inquiry into the circumstances of Frost's death is
being carried out by the local health authority, Johnson said.

   More and more of this city's power brokers
seem to be skipping those three-martini lunches in favor of
late-afternoon English tea, closing their deals over a cup of
Darjeeling, watercress sandwiches and crumpets slathered with
strawberry jam.
   Some of Washington's most exclusive hotels report that corporate
executives, lawyers, lobbyists and even congressmen are leading a
briefcase invasion of the genteel sanctuaries once reserved for
white-gloved ladies in their search for a quiet place to wheel and
deal.
   ``What's happening is that teatime is replacing the cocktail
hour,'' says trial lawyer Cary Pollak, a self-taught expert on
afternoon tea. ``Instead of the power lunch, it is getting to be
more the custom to conduct business over a power tea.''
   Georgetown's swank Four Seasons Hotel, part of a Canadian chain
of hostelries, is credited with introducing the capital to the
leisurely delights of afternoon tea about 10 years ago. Other
hotels followed, trundling out their tea carts every day at 3
o'clock.
   Most of the hotel restaurant managers interviewed in a random
telephone survey said their tea customers at first were almost
exclusively women, but they are seeing more and more men enjoying
this hallowed, high-calorie English ritual.
   ``I think it's catching on,'' said Cynthia Gumnick, manager of
the 50-seat Nest Lounge in the Willard Intercontinental Hotel, two
blocks from the White House.
   ``We're seeing more and more men,'' she said. ``They don't turn
up their noses at the door like they used to. They come in, sit
down and enjoy themselves. Sometimes four or five gentlemen will
order a larger table and spread out their papers before they order
tea.''
   Prices generally range from about $7 to $12, depending on what
customers consume with their tea.
   The Willard's typically lavish spread includes a choice of eight
varieties of hot tea, followed by finger sandwiches, scones with
thick Devon cream and strawberry jam and an assortment of cakes,
fruit tarts and petite pastries.
   Will Hancock of the Four Seasons reported that a couple of
big-name congressmen, whom he refused to identify, have gotten into
the habit of slipping into his Garden Terrace restaurant
occasionally to confer over afternoon tea.
   David Carr, manager of the lobby lounge at the Park Hyatt Hotel,
said a growing number of men accounts for about 20 percent of his
teatime business. He hopes to boost that figure with a marketing
campaign promoting afternoon tea as ``a good opportunity to relax
and conduct business.''
   Steve Johnson of the Mayflower Hotel said the growth in male
customers for afternoon tea coincides with a general decline in
alcoholic consumption and the lure of a quiet, relaxed cafe
atmosphere where the hubbub of the cocktail bar never intrudes on
serious conversation.
   All this is pleasant news to Pollak, 44, a civil trial lawyer
for the District of Columbia and bachelor chef who gives cooking
classes for interested amateurs in the country-style kitchen of his
townhouse in suburban Alexandria, Va.
   ``Afternoon tea is one of the finest customs we have inherited
from our English ancestors,'' said Pollak, who instructs his
students on the formal etiquette and proper preparation of an
English tea, which he frequently serves to his weekend dinner
guests.
   Pollak shows his students how to cut a lemon in thin slices for
resting in the bottom of teacups. They learn to carve the crusts
from tiny watercress and cucumber sandwiches. They roll the dough
on his antique oak kitchen table to make scones, the biscuit-shaped
cake that traditionally is served with a dollop of clotted sweet
cream.
   ``Litigation is very adversarial and aggressive,'' says Pollak,
who comes home exhausted from his 60-hour work weeks. ``Teaching
people how to prepare a gourmet meal or an afternoon tea gives me
pleasure. It's not a battleground, and everybody wins.''

<TEXT>
   A campaign celebrated today that has helped
millions of Americans quit smoking had its origins 15 years ago
when a small-town newspaper publisher printed the names of his
neighbors who went cold turkey for a day.
   Today's Great American Smokeout stems from an idea by Lynn
Smith, former publisher of the weekly Monticello Times.
   ``People said you couldn't get people to stop,'' said Smith,
founder of ``Don't Smoke Day,'' which was held Jan. 7, 1974, in
this Mississippi River town 40 miles northwest of Minneapolis. ``I
was ridiculed.''
   Smith persuaded 291 of the town's 2,300 residents to quit
smoking for one day. He said he put their names in print ``so they
were on the record.''
   Three years later, the American Cancer Society began the Great
American Smokeout. Held the third Thursday of November, the society
hopes this year that 10 million smokers will give up their
cigarettes for at least 24 hours.
   Nearly three of every 10 Americans smoke, according to Adele
Paronie, a spokeswoman for the cancer society. That's down from the
37 percent who smoked in 1974, the year of Smith's first ``D-Day.''
   Smith, 69, continues to write a column in the Times. And he's
still active in the campaign to end smoking.
   He himself quit in 1954 after 19 years of smoking.
   ``I had no idea it would reach such proportions,'' Smith said of
the Great American Smokeout. ``I was surprised and gratified that
an idea could grow to such extent.''
   Cancer society spokesman Curtis Allen, who quit smoking 10 years
ago after a Smokeout, said the society's goal is to get 20 percent
of the estimated 50 million smokers to kick the habit today.
   Of those who tried quitting last year, more than 5.4 million
abstained for the entire 24 hours, and 3.4 million stopped for at
least one to three days, Allen said, citing numbers from a Gallup
Poll commissioned by the society.
   Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory
disease. The surgeon general has warned of the potentially fatal
risks of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine, the active
drug in cigarettes.
   The Tobacco Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based lobbying group
for the tobacco industry, said it will release a poll that it says
shows smokers and non-smokers are more tolerant of each other than
most people believe.
   Tom Lauria, a spokesman for the institute, said the poll found
that 73 percent of adults polled believe that smoking by adults is
a personal matter and ``nobody's business but their own.''
   Lauria said that 76 percent of those polled think there ought to
be a place for people to smoke in every public place.
   ``We like the fact that (the poll) shows a fairness to both
smokers and non-smokers,'' Lauria said.
   The survey of 1,500 adults, conducted by the Washington, D.C.,
polling firm of Frederick-Schneiders, has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percent, Lauria said.

<HEAD>Farm Stockpiles Continue to Shrink</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once-huge stockpiles of taxpayer-owned surplus
farm commodities have continued to shrink, an Agriculture
Department report shows.
   The department's Commodity Credit Corp. said Wednesday that it
had $9.8 billion invested in price support loans and actual
inventories as of Aug. 31. That included $6 billion in loans and
$3.8 billion in the CCC's inventory.
   Keith Bjerke, executive vice president of CCC, a corporation
wholly owned by the department, said the total investment a year
earlier was $16.2 billion, including $9.5 billion in loans
outstanding and inventories of $6.7 billion.
   Under price support programs financed by the CCC, some major
items _ mainly grains _ are mortgaged to the agency by farmers, or
``put under loan.'' While under loan, the farmer still owns the
commodity but cannot sell or use it until the debt to CCC is
cleared.
   Producers have the option of repaying the loans and then selling
or using the commodities as they choose. Or they may forfeit the
products in lieu of repayment, in which case the commodity is taken
over by CCC and becomes part of its surplus inventory.
   The dairy program is a major exception to this system. No direct
loan program is operated for milk producers, but the CCC buys
butter, cheese and non-fat dry milk to support the price of milk
paid to farmers by dealers. The purchased products also become part
of the CCC inventory.
   Other CCC holdings under loan and as inventory include wheat,
feed grains, rice, tobacco, cotton, soybeans, honey and sugar.
   The surplus commodities are used as a huge stockpile for use
under a number of USDA programs, including food donations to
schools and other institutions and food aid overseas.
   Certificates, redeemable in CCC-owned commodities, also have
been used as export subsidies paid to private companies, and as
partial payments to farmers participating in some federal crop
programs.
   Substantial reductions in CCC holdings from year-earlier levels
have been going on for many months as supplies were drained off.
May 31, for example, total holdings were valued at $13.5 billion,
down from $23.1 billion on May 31, 1988.
   In the case of major grain crops, the 1988 drought reduced
production and pushed up prices. That reduced the need for price
support loans and forfeitures. Market prices of some other products
also were high enough to reduce the need for CCC purchases to
bolster prices.
   Overall, the report said commodities acquired by CCC during the
first 11 months of the 1989 fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 had an
``acquisition value'' of about $2.76 billion, compared with $12.1
billion in the same period of 1988.
   Another factor in the CCC operation has been the farmer-owned
grain reserve, which enables wheat and feed grains to be stored and
kept off the market under government loan until prices rise enough
to trigger their release. The reserve is included in overall CCC
holdings.
   The report said that as of Aug. 31 the reserve consisted of
211.4 million bushels of wheat valued at $757.1 million and 767.5
million bushels of feed grain worth $1.9 billion.
   Net losses to CCC totaled about $4.3 billion through Aug. 31,
compared with almost $12.4 billion for the same period in 1988, the
report said. The decline was due mostly to the smaller volume of
grain moving into CCC inventories and reduced payments to farmers.

   The Agriculture Department says two farms near
Boone, Iowa, are in friendly competition to test the merits of
low-input methods against more traditional ways of producing crops.
   Information will be gathered by USDA scientists over a number of
years to help determine which kind of farming is superior, the
department's Agricultural Research Service said Wednesday. The
study began last spring, and results of the 1989 harvest are being
analyzed.
   Jerry L. Hatfield of the USDA agency said the Iowa project is
``one of the first studies to combine basic scientific studies with
an economic analysis.''
   Two adjacent 40-acre fields are being used, he said. One is part
of a 300-acre private research farm that belongs to Dick and Sharon
Thompson, longtime advocates of low-input, sustainable agriculture
designed to maintain the environment as well as the farm.
   Except for a few experimental plots, the Thompsons have used no
pesticides or commercial nitrogen fertilizer on the land since
1967. Crop rotations are used, including corn, soybeans, oats and
hay.
   The adjacent field is part of 1,400 acres of corn and soybeans
farmed by David Snyder with minimum fall tillage. He has rotated
corn and soybean crops on his land for at least 15 years. Snyder
uses pesticides and commercial fertilizers ``judiciously,'' the
report said.
   Hatfield, director of the USDA agency's National Soil Tilth
Laboratory in Ames, Iowa, is working with colleagues to conduct the
farm comparison study.
   ``They will evaluate the soil from the top down, including the
movement of pesticides and fertilizers and the potential for
leaching to groundwater,'' the report said.
   The researchers also will be looking at earthworms and other
soil organisms to determine what effects the farming methods have
on them.
   Thompson says his main argument with Snyder and other farmers is
that they till land in the fall, causing earthworm populations to
decline.
   Initial samples show more worms in Thompson's field, but the
report said, ``The jury is still out on who has more worms.''

<HEAD>Derwinski Pledges to Keep VA Hospitals Open</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski is
pledging to keep rural VA hospitals open, a promise lawmakers say
they welcome but contend doesn't address all the health-care
problems for veterans who live in sparsely populated areas.
   ``I have no intention of closing and no intention of making
changes that in any way would diminish hospital care in rural
areas,'' Derwinski told the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee.
``These kinds of locations must stay.''
   Derwinski referred specifically to hospitals in Fargo, N.D., Hot
Springs, S.D., Martinsburg, W.Va., Miles City, Mont., Prescott,
Ariz., and Walla Walla, Wash.
   Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, complained at Wednesday's
hearing that most Washington policy-makers lacked a sensitivity to
the vast distances that people in the West must travel for health
care.
   Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., complained that many rural
veterans were being denied the health care to which they are
accustomed. VA facilities, he said, have limited their treatment in
the last five years to only the poorest veterans and those with
service-connected disabilities.
   ``We made a decision retroactively affecting these veterans that
is just a disaster for these veterans,'' said Daschle, adding that
most are too old to enter private insurance programs.
   ``There are veterans who are being turned away and they are
getting sicker or dying as a result,'' he said.
   Dr. Daniel Winship of the VA's medical division said there was
no policy decision to cut the so-called Category B and C patients.
He said that the demand for care by Category A patients has
``virtually consumed'' the VA's resources.
   Health care for rural veterans, like rural health care in
general, suffers from a shortage of doctors and nurses, difficult
access to facilities and a lack of resources because most rural
hospitals are not affiliated with medical schools.
   The American Legion says that 95 percent of all veterans live
within a 100-mile radius of the nearest VA facility, but 83 percent
of the veterans served by the Miles City, Mont., hospital live more
than 100 miles from it.
   Baucus noted that Los Angeles has nine centers compared with two
in Montana, and Derwinski said in his native Chicago three
hospitals were within six miles of one another.

   Senate Republicans thwarted in their efforts
to cut capital gains taxes are looking to 1990, but key Democrats
say a reduction is no sure thing.
   ``Of course we'll consider capital gains next year,'' said Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance
Committee. But, he added, it will be considered with other parts of
a package for encouraging saving and investment.
   ``One day we will have 60 votes to pass the capital gains tax''
cut, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., said Wednesday, shortly before the
Senate refused for the second consecutive day to shut off a
Democratic filibuster against the reduction.
   Each time, the vote was 51-47 for limiting debate, nine short of
the 60 needed. All 45 Republicans were joined by the same six
Democrats in favoring a limitation.
   President Bush, who promised a capital gains tax cut during his
campaign last year, won a reduction in the House in September when
60 Democrats and all but one Republican united behind the proposal.
The effort died in the Senate because Majority Leader George J.
Mitchell, D-Maine, convinced some Democrats who have favored a
reduction that now is not the time.
   Bush contends that taxing capital gains _ profits from the sale
of investments _ at a lower rate than applies to wages would
encourage investment and create jobs.
   ``If the capital gains tax is lowered ... some people will
undertake transactions they would not otherwise undertake,''
Packwood said. In turn, ``you will raise money (for the government)
by lowering the capital gains tax rate and we can use that money
for other programs.''
   Mitchell and Bentsen criticized the reduction on grounds 80
percent of the benefit would go to people with incomes over
$100,000 a year. It also would worsen the federal budget deficit,
they said.
   ``It will be a fantastic windfall ... for the very wealthiest
Americans, which the middle class will end up paying for through
higher deficits or increased taxes,'' Mitchell said.
   ``It is wrong, just wrong, that the president puts a higher
priority on cutting capital gains taxes than on reducing the
federal budget deficit.''
   Packwood's plan would exclude a portion of capital gains from
tax, with a larger exclusion allowed for longer-held property. For
example, 5 percent of the profits from the sale of assets owned
more than one year would be excluded; the exclusion would increase
gradually to a maximum of 35 percent for property owned more than
seven years.
   The proposal also includes an amendment by Sen. Bill Roth,
R-Del., expanding Individual Retirement Accounts. A worker could
contribute up to $2,000 a year to an IRA and get no immediate tax
benefit. However, interest that accumulates would be tax-free
forever.
   On another budget front, Senate leaders hope to complete a
bipartisan deficit-reduction package designed to help break a
House-Senate deadlock over how to reduce this year's $116 billion
federal budget shortfall.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said the
proposal could be unveiled before the end of the week and would
pressure the House and Bush administration to agree to a
budget-cutting bill.
   ``We think the legislative branch has a responsibility to
produce its own ... (deficit reduction) bill, and the executive
branch has the responsibility to decide whether it wants to sign
it,'' Sasser said.
   Lawmakers and White House officials have been squabbling over a
deficit-reduction measure for weeks. Because of that stalemate, $16
billion in cuts in most federal programs were imposed by the
Gramm-Rudman law Oct. 1 and remain in effect.
   The six Democrats who sided with Republicans on the vote
Wednesday are Sens. Bennett Johnston of Louisiana, Howell Heflin
and Richard Shelby of Alabama, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, David
Boren of Oklahoma and Joe Lieberman of Connecticut.
   Sens. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, did
not vote. Both oppose the capital-gains tax cut.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Customs Service high-tech surveillance
plane had a partial radar failure just as it was about to take the
agency's new commissioner _ and the federal drug policy director _
on a VIP demonstration flight.
   The flight took place Monday as scheduled for Customs
Commissioner Carol Hallett and William Bennett, but the radar was
unable to scan its full range of airspace because some power was
out.
   The aircraft uses sophisticated computer equipment to locate and
track drug-smuggling aircraft.
   ``It was picking up a multitude of targets,'' Customs Service
spokesman David Hoover said Wednesday, concluding the flight was a
success. ``There was no perceptible difference in the way the radar
works between high and low power.''
   However, other Customs Service sources, speaking only on
condition they not be named, said that a mission would normally
have been aborted with a similar failure. They said that on low
power, the radar can scan about 80 miles instead of the normal 250
miles.
   The VIP mission was designed to show off the multicolored
computer displays while taking Bennett and Mrs. Hallett from
Savannah, Ga., to Tampa, Fla., where they were to speak at a drug
conference.
   Hoover said Wednesday that the difficulties began Sunday night
when one of the agency's two P-3 airborne early warning aircraft
left its base in Corpus Christi, Texas, on a regular surveillance
mission. That plane had a failure in the radar system and returned
to base.
   The second P-3 was sent Monday to pick up the officials, but a
fluid pump in the cooling system failed in flight. The system pumps
vital coolant to the radar components, which cannot be allowed to
overheat.
   The plane bound for Savannah made an unscheduled landing in New
Orleans in an effort to fix the problem. But to get the part,
Customs officials had to fly the plane that was grounded Sunday
night to New Orleans so the defective part could be switched.
   The cooling system in the Savannah-bound plane was corrected,
but when the radar was turned on, a spark knocked out the
components that let the radar run on high power.
   Bennett ``knew there was some concern about the radar,'' said
his spokesman Don Hamilton. ``But he had a great trip. He enjoyed
it. He learned a lot of useful information.''

<TEXT>
   A select group of West German
officials has been meeting this week to try to devise a strategy
for making sure, without appearing too meddlesome, that the changes
continue in East Germany.
   West Germany is elated over East Germany's opening of its
borders a week ago as well as over promises by the ruling
Communists in East Berlin of easing state control with sweeping
political and economic reforms.
   With an offer of massive financial assistance that has strings
attached, the Bonn government is seeking to encourage the process.
Yet it is trying hard not to invite charges it seeks to destabilize
the East German leadership.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said this week that ``exporting
capitalism'' could hurt the growing climate of cooperation in
Europe and also reaffirmed the Soviet Union's opposition to any
suggestions of German reunification.
   Juergen Chrobog, spokesman for Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher, said interfering in East Germany's internal affairs is
the furthest thing from Bonn's intentions.
   ``We don't want to interfere and take advantage of a weakened
government. We must give them time to develop,'' he said Wednesday.
   A group of officials from eight federal ministries has since
Monday been holding closed-door sessions to consider how to best
support East Germany's reform processes in the long term.
   The group has been working on a ``catalog'' of possible ways to
help East Germany, said chief government spokesman Hans Klein.
   Officials said the ideas included short- and long-term economic
assistance and how such aid could be best carried out.
   Improvements in cooperation in the areas of transportation,
telephone communications and environmental projects were also
discussed.
   West German officials are also considering setting up a special
fund to finance improvements in East Germany and to help East
German visitors get the convertible currency they need to travel
West, Bonn government sources said.
   Klein said Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of
staff, would discuss the ideas with East German Communist Party
chief Egon Krenz in East Berlin on Monday.
   Klein also indicated Kohl might postpone a crucial summit with
Krenz until after an emergency Dec. 15-17 congress of East
Germany's Communist Party that could choose a new party leadership.
   West German government officials make no efforts to conceal
their uncertainty over where East Germany is headed.
   ``Concerning long-term help, we have to have discussions with
them to find out what their needs are, what their problems are. We
don't even know what they want,'' said Chrobog.
   ``Herr Seiters will go there (East Berlin), and when he comes
back we will make decisions,'' said Chrobog.
   Bonn has been sending out unclear signals on how much financial
assistance it will pledge.
   On Saturday, Kohl told reporters economic assistance to East
Germany cannot be successful unless the ``system of a state-planned
economy'' gives way to a ``socially responsible market economy.''
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann on Tuesday said a massive
economic aid program for East Germany should be contingent upon
concrete economic reforms.
   Genscher on Tuesday said Bonn should not set conditions for its
aid but that the reform process in East Germany must show
``definite signals.''
   Volker Ruehe, general secretary of Kohl's Christian Democrats,
said Wednesday that some assistance could be offered to East
Germany soon, including an overhaul of East Germany's troubled
telephone communications network and environmental projects.
   But Ruehe said ``far-reaching changes in the current economic
system'' are needed for East Germany to be able to attract
desperately needed private investment.
   East Germany's state-run news media as well as the country's
main opposition group, New Forum, have indicated wariness over West
Germany's intentions.
   New Forum has expressed concern Western capitalists might
exploit an unstable East Germany without helping its people. And
the country's news media have warned against a ``sellout'' to West
Germany.
   But Klein rejected any suggestion that West Germany wanted to
impose its own type of economic system on its Communist neighbor.
   ``We export a lot of things, but not capitalism,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Member Seeks GAO Probe of Labor's Handling of Pension Cases</HEAD>

   The Labor Department may have a ``major
problem looming'' in the way it handles allegations of pension plan
fraud, says the chairman of a House panel in seeking a
congressional audit of those investigations.
   But an assistant labor secretary, David George Ball, appeared
before the House subcommittee on Wednesday to dispute such warnings
and ``take a moment to reassure the nation's workers and retirees
that the pension system is sound.''
   The acting Labor Department inspector general, Raymond Maria,
said lax auditing and enforcement in the multibillion-dollar
private pension system have created a ``window of opportunity'' for
unscrupulous managers to pilfer Americans' pensions.
   Subcommittee Chairman Rep. Bill Hughes, said of Maria's
testimony: ``I think that in the final analysis many of his
conclusions are valid, that we could have a major problem
looming.'' He said he is asking the General Accounting Office to
look into the handling of 1,600 cases investigated by the Labor
Department last year.
   Hughes, chairman of the Subcommittee on Retirement Income and
Employment, said the public need not panic but cautioned:
``Ignoring a situation where such large sums of money are subjected
to few effective outside investiwttention, the auditing process is
slow and enforcement policies lean toward civil suits rather than
criminal cases.
   Ball, assistant labor secretary for pension and welfare
benefits, said his department was examining recommendations and
added, ``the pension system, by any objective measure, has never
been healthier.''
   In an earlier interview, Hughes expressed skepticism about such
assurances. ``I heard the same sectors saying the savings and loan
situation wasn't serious five years ago,'' he said.
   Maria, a former FBI agent, said, ``Our goal is not to
unnecessarily frighten people, but to stimulate concern where such
concern is needed, and to avoid potential future crisis.''
   He also discussed infighting in the Labor Department, which led
to a Justice Department opinion in March barring his office from
directly investigating private pension plans. That job is handled
by the department's Pension Benefits Welfare Administration, which
has 300 inspectors to police the nation's 870,000 private pension
programs.
   Over the past five years, more than 25 percent of the plans
audited by the agency had violations of the 1974 Employee
Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA. But the PBWA on
average investigates less than 1 percent of the nation's pension
plans.
   The inspector general's office wants the law changed to require
private accountants who audit pension programs to report any
violations to the Labor Department. It also says the Labor
Department should pursue more criminal cases against violators,
rather than relying largely on civil suits.
   Ball responded that the department's enforcement policy is
designed to deliver ``the biggest bang for the buck and affecting
the most participants possible.''
   ``The secretary and I intend to come down with hob-nail boots on
criminal violators,'' he said.
   In 1988, only 23 of the 1,610 cases audited were classified as
criminal cases.
   Ball said the Labor Department concentrates on plans covering
more than 100 employees and targets its investigations ``on plans
which we believe have a high chance of violating the law.''

<HEAD>Elderly Are Silent Casualties in Drug War, Panel Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-year-old Evelyn Blackwell is one of
few elderly residents in her neighborhood who dares to stand up to
the drug dealers.
   ``We've got senior citizens who are afraid in their own homes
and afraid to come out,'' the longtime Washington resident said
Wednesday.
   Miami's Rosemary Dalton, 65, said seniors in her public housing
project are ``afraid and sick and tired'' of the dope dealers.
   ``You can smell the ether and they make so much noise you can't
sleep,'' Dalton said.
   Elsie Taylor-Jordan of Alexandria, Va., at 63 is raising her
1{-year-old great-granddaughter, Ashley, abandoned by the baby's
drug-addicted mother.
   ``Being able to use drugs whenever she wanted was more important
than caring for her child,'' Taylor-Jordan said.
   America's elderly are silent casualties in the nation's drug
war, isolated in crack-infested neighborhoods, abused by violent
addicts and left to rear babies abandoned by drug-abusing parents,
a Senate committee was told.
   Instead of finding refuge in their families, many seniors suffer
drug-related violence at home at the hands of addicted relatives
and neighbors, Brooklyn District Attorney Elizabeth Holtzman told
the Special Committee on Aging.
   ``No bond of love can stand in the way of crack,'' Holtzman
testified. ``Hundreds, even thousands of older New Yorkers are now
vulnerable to murder, to assault by their children, grandchildren
or great-grandchildren desperate for their next fix of crack.''
   Holtzman told of one case in which a Brooklyn woman suffocated
after her son tied her to a bed and set the room on fire because
she refused to give him money for crack.
   Sgt. Robert Crawford of the Oakland Police Department in
California said some elderly residents lose control of their homes
when adult children or grandchildren turn the property into a haven
for crack users.
   ``Many times the elderly person will ignore the activity and
simply hide in a back bedroom,'' Crawford said. ``When the police
raids come he or she is left behind until the arrestee returns
after posting bail or being released because of overcrowded jails.
The process then repeats itself.''
   Committee Chairman David Pryor, D-Ark., said the extent to which
the elderly are being victimized by the drug crisis is difficult to
measure because many keep silent due to a ``sense of fear and
shame.''
   ``In preparing for this hearing, we heard plenty of stories
about abuse of the elderly as a result of drugs _ yet it was
virtually impossible to find someone willing to make their story
public,'' Pryor said.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said his staff had a similar experience
trying to find public witnesses from among elderly residents of a
Pennsylvania housing project where drug problems made life ``hell
in a high-rise.''
   ``They were afraid of reprisals, they were afraid of telling the
truth, they didn't want the drug dealers to know,'' Heinz said.
   Heinz urged swift approval of legislation he has proposed to
expedite the eviction of drug dealers from public housing projects.
Pryor said that as Congress puts more money into fighting drugs,
``we must ensure that the often hidden victims of drug abuse are
not forgotten.''
   Holtzman said the popularity of crack has been a major reason
for an upturn in violence against the elderly. She said her office
handled 400 percent more elderly abuse cases in 1988 than in 1986,
the year that crack use took off.
   Many more cases go unreported because parents and grandparents
often are ``deeply ashamed about the violence visited upon them by
their offspring'' or afraid of retaliation if they turn someone in,
Holtzman said.
   States need massive new resources for local law enforcement,
drug treatment, education and prevention, and services for drug
abusers and victims, Holtzman said.
   ``Although both the president and Congress have been aware of
the enormity of America's drug crisis and proclaimed a war, they
have not funded one,'' she said.

   A bill that would allow schools more
flexibility in the use of federal education dollars in exchange for
improving student performance gets a hearing today, but one critic
is calling the legislation ``nonsense.''
   ``I don't like it,'' Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the
House Education and Labor Committee, told reporters at the National
Press Club this week.
   ``I think it's nonsense. ... It's part of deregulation. But Mr.
Smith is very sincere about it. I see nothing wrong with having the
hearing.''
   The bill, introduced by Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., would create a
voluntary program allowing local schools more flexibility in the
use of federal education dollars in exchange for improving student
performance. Participation in the program would be canceled if
student achievements worsen within two years.
   Among the scheduled witnesses are New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean;
Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers;
and Stephanie Robinson of the National Urban League.
   Hawkins contends that a bill signed into law last year addresses
many of the concerns raised in Smith's bill.
   ``Trying new ideas when we already have success seems to be a
foolish waste of money,'' he said.
   Hawkins also complained that President Bush and the nation's
governors failed to specify at a September education summit the
federal regulations that are the most frustrating for educators.
   ``To some extent I'm for simplification of regulations,'' he
said. ``I would hope that this hearing will help ... find out what
they're talking about. The president made a commitment to the
governors that he would sponsor deregulation. Well, obviously they
want to get money with no strings attached. But that doesn't mean
it's good for children.''
   Smith, an educator and former Vermont lieutenant governor,
introduced the bill days before the historic education summit that
concluded with an agreement that national performance goals would
be developed and federal regulations tied to key education programs
would be loosened.
   In a joint statement, Bush and the governors said, ``we want to
swap red tape for results.''
   Smith said the summit gave his bill the impetus it needed.
   ``It's a difference between night and day,'' Smith said in an
interview Wednesday. ``The idea of restructuring is something that
a number of us has been working on for five to six years. It's
bipartisan, but mostly at the gubernatorial and state commission
level. (The summit) propelled the idea onto the national agenda.''
   The bill specifies that the civil rights of students cannot be
infringed in exercising local flexibility with federal dollars _ a
provision Smith said ensures that programs for disadvantaged
students won't be shortchanged.
   Smith said he had gotten positive reaction from many members of
Congress, although the National Education Association is ``more
guarded'' and the National Urban League insists it ``doesn't go far
enough.''
   ``It's a big change,'' he said. ``We're talking about a major
concept on how we relate to schools. It ought to be controversial.
People ought to care deeply about it and ask tough questions about
it.''

<TEXT>
   The ``no trespassing'' sign is out in Montana
_ for the Yellowstone bison, that is.
   And violators will be shot.
   The National Park Service promised Wednesday to try to keep the
northern herd of about 400 bison at Yellowstone National Park from
roaming onto Montana rangeland this winter, as state officials said
that once again they stand ready to shoot bison that wander north
of the park.
   Last winter nearly 600 bison from the Yellowstone herd were shot
and killed by ranchers and hunters under the eyes of Montana game
wardens, prompting an outcry from some environmentalists and animal
rights organizations.
   Montana officials said the ``controlled harvesting'' of
wandering bison is needed to protect ranchers, although the state
and park authorities have reached agreement on an interim bison
management plan within the park.
   ``Montana does not want to be viewed as being unrealistic or
uncooperative,'' said K.L. Cool, the state's director of fish and
wildlife, during a visit to Washington where he sought to explain
the state's policy.
   ``If the bison leave the park they are fair game. ... We're
faced with a threat to our own livestock industry,'' he said. ``The
animal is not welcomed in Montana.''
   Bob Barbee, superintendent of Yellowstone National Park, who
along with Cool met with reporters to discuss plans to deal with
the bison problem this winter, acknowledged that the northern herd
has grown too large. It is down to 400 bison from more than 900
last year, but is still at least 100 animals more than what park
officials and authorities in Montana say is manageable.
   Barbee said he and state officials have agreed on developing a
bison management plan that would limit the northern herd to between
200 and 300 animals. At those numbers it is hoped the herd could be
contained to the park, he said.
   But the park superintendent acknowledged that ways to reduce the
herd have yet to be worked out, short of letting them roam onto
private rangeland and be killed. He said he has no way of assuring
that the bison now in the park will remain within its boundaries by
January and February.
   ``Trying to herd a buffalo doesn't work. Buffalo are herded
where they want to go,'' said Barbee, adding that park workers hope
to influence the big animals by ``gentle hazing,'' perhaps by
helicopter.
   Ranchers have complained vigorously that the buffalo that roam
from the park damage property and threaten to infect cows with
brucellosis, a bacterial disease that causes cows to abort their
calves. Montana has struggled for years and spent an estimated $30
million to rid its cattle of the disease, according to state
officials.
   Although no cases have surfaced where Montana cows have been
infected from bison, Cool attributed that largely to efforts to
keep the bison and cows separated. Blood tests have shown that more
than half of the bison killed in the state last year had the
disease, he said.
   Yellowstone has about 2,500 bison in three major herds on more
than 2.4 million acres. But ranchers are concerned only about the
northern herd that grazes near the Montana border.
   Montana officials, National Park Service officials and many
conservationists agree that the long-term answer to the bison
problem is to control the number of buffalo in the park, so that
they are less inclined to roam for food and better habitat.
   Douglas Inkley, a wildlife resource specialist for the National
Wildlife Federation, suggests one answer might be to reintroduce a
natural predator, the Rocky Mountain wolf, into the park.
   Barbee was careful to stay away from that idea. Proposals to
reintroduce the wolf to Yellowstone have been even more
controversial among area ranchers than has the roaming bison.

   As Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir nears
the end of a fast-paced visit, the Bush administration is looking
for a go-ahead on Mideast talks from Egypt and the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``There is a need for us to get a positive response from the
Egyptians for the process to move forward,'' a senior U.S. official
said Wednesday after Shamir concluded back-to-back talks with
President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Before flying to Cincinnati for a reunion with former President
Reagan tonight, Shamir was meeting today with members of the House
Foreign Affairs and the Senate Foreign Relations Committees.
   The 74-year-old prime minister seemed tired and yet upbeat in
summing up his sessions with Bush and Baker at a news conference
late Tuesday.
   ``In principle, I cannot see any deep differences between our
positions and American positions,'' he said. ``It's only a matter
of details.''
   Shamir, whose proposal for talks with Palestinian Arabs had U.S.
support, is seeking assurances the PLO would not get a foot in the
door of the negotiations.
   He said he came away from his talks with Bush and Baker
convinced that ``they will not do anything to force us to sit
together and negotiate with them (the PLO) if we do not want to.''
   Shamir wants to restrict the talks with Palestinians to setting
up an election on the West Bank and Gaza. The winners would
negotiate with Israel a form of limited self-rule for the
Palestinians.
   But, Shamir said, Egypt in behalf of the PLO has tried to
broaden the agenda for the talks to other issues. Referring to the
Egyptian president, he said ``(Hosni) Mubarak now understands it
was a blunder.''
   Earlier, Shamir said ``there are some obstacles that we have to
remove and work out. It will be a long process. It will take time.
It's not easy.''
   The PLO, dealing with the administration through Egypt, has not
given a green light for Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza
to meet with Israel to arrange the election.
   Baker said a response from Egypt was essential for the talks to
move ahead.
   Referring to Israel's conditional acceptance of his plan for the
talks, Baker said, ``I hope we will soon be receiving a similar
response from Egypt.''
   Baker and Shamir said they made progress toward negotiations,
but a senior U.S. official who requested anonymity said, ``I can't
tell you that we have sorted out specific details.''
   Before Shamir called on Bush, there were reports of U.S.
impatience with Israel for seeking various assurances on the
discussions.
   After the session, Shamir and U.S. officials struck a friendly
stance.
   ``There is no more tension,'' Shamir said. He also told
reporters, ``I think we made some progress.''
   Marlin Fitzwater, the presidential spokesman, said Bush was not
frustrated with Shamir over the delay in getting to the table.
   ``It's important not to become impatient when you're dealing
with the Middle East,'' Fitzwater said. ``Two thousand years is the
normal wait for things to happen.''
   Bush also took up two other touchy issues with Shamir _ Israel's
military cooperation with South Africa and an expansion of Jewish
settlements on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Last week, a U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said there
was ``very great concern'' that Israel may have provided U.S.
technology to South Africa for a missile test last summer.
   And on Tuesday, Margaret D. Tutwiler, the State Department
spokeswoman, denounced as an obstacle to peace a planned Israeli
settlement in northern Gaza.
   Shamir has insisted on the right of Jews to live anywhere.
   Asked about Israel's South African connection, he said military
contracts had been ``reduced to the greatest extent'' in the past
2{ years.
   ``There is no question about it,'' Shamir said. ``We are not
busy with any nuclear arms.''

   President Bush says no government should stand
in the way of changes sweeping Eastern Europe, but promises that
next month's summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will
not be used ``to negotiate the future of Europe.''
   Bush made his statement Wednesday after Gorbachev reaffirmed his
firm opposition to German reunification despite the opening of the
Berlin Wall.
   Gorbachev said in Moscow the existence of two Germanys ``has
been recognized by the world community'' since the end of World War
II and that even talk about reunification constitutes interference
in the affairs of the two countries.
   Bush, in a speech to a convention of the AFL-CIO, reiterated his
call for a Europe ``whole and free'' but did not directly call for
a reunified Germany, which U.S. policy envisions.
   Before an audience that included Solidarity leader Lech Walesa,
Bush said he watched in awe last week as Berliners danced atop the
Berlin Wall.
   He said he had expected to see the wall opened during his
lifetime and hoped it would happen during his presidency.
   ``Change has a way of sweeping through like a fast-moving
train,'' Bush said. ``And no one and no government should stand in
its way.''
   While praising the easing of travel restrictions in
Czechoslovakia, Bush said ``freedom of travel is not enough. Only
free and unfettered elections can satisfy the yearnings of a free
people.''
   Bush and Gorbachev will meet Dec. 2 and 3 on ships in the
Mediterranean off the coast of Malta. The president then may go on
to Brussels to report to NATO allies on the trip.
   The president said he and Gorbachev ``are not meeting to
negotiate the future of Europe.
   ``The peoples of Eastern Europe are speaking their own minds
about that future and they are calling for democracy, freedom of
the press and of conscience, the right of the governed to choose
their leaders,'' Bush said.
   The agenda of the next month's summit and expectations of any
accomplishments appear to be shifting as the meeting approaches.
   Bush originally said the meeting would not be an arms-control
summit, but the White House said Wednesday that arms negotiations
will be discussed.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush and
Gorbachev likely would reach ``a consensus in their thinking'' for
progress to reduce strategic nuclear forces and conventional arms
in Europe. However, he said it was ``quite doubtful'' that any
papers would be signed.
   The press spokesman acknowledged that Washington and Moscow were
sparring over the summit's outcome.
   He said the Soviets have a tendency ``to build expectations
before a summit, and we have a tendency to play them down.
   ``I suspect the reality is somewhere in the middle,'' he said.
``But I would urge you to discount theirs a little bit on the top
side.''

<TEXT>
   Plans to extend the life of the embattled U.S.
Civil Rights Commission for six months are on their way to the
Senate after winning approval from the House.
   The bill approved Wednesday was designed to keep the commission
from automatically going out of business at the end of the month
but keep it on the front burner in view of its recent problems. The
vote was 278-135.
   Approval of the stopgap measure by the full House came a day
after it emerged from the Judiciary Committee amid concerns that
action was necessary to reconstitute the commission and end its
internal strife.
   An alternative GOP plan would have deliberately put the
commission out of business _ for one day only _ to give President
Bush a chance to dump the current members. It then would have been
reconstituted for six years.
   Democrats said it would be unwise to go ahead with a six-year
bill with lawmakers about to wrap up their business and go home
until after the holidays.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said he initially had favored a
one-year measure but bowed to the belief of Sen. Paul Simon,
D-Ill., that six months was time enough to resolve the issue.
   In the 1960s, civil rights forces hailed the commission's
hearings across the South, its ringing reports on racial injustice
and bold legislative proposals. Since 1983, however, the atmosphere
has soured and both parties in Congress have combined to slash the
panel's funding.
   Controversy has focused on former Chairman William B. Allen, who
remains a member of the commission. He recently came under fire
after delivering to a conservative group a speech titled: ``Blacks?
Animals? Homosexuals? What is a Minority?''
   The commission, in a 6-1 vote, called the speech ``thoughtless,
disgusting and unnecessarily inflammatory.'' Allen, who is black,
calls himself the only conservative on the panel and says he does
``not believe in coddling people.''
   Lawmakers say he's not alone in fanning the controversy and that
at least one other member of the commission has made ``bizarre''
remarks.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has launched a covert
effort to overthrow Panama's Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, with the
acquiescence of the Senate and House intelligence committees, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The CIA has been authorized to spend $3 million initially to
sponsor a coup by recruiting Panamanian military officers or other
dissidents, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   The covert operation has no restrictions beyond an order
prohibiting Noriega's assassination, and the use of U.S. troops
along with other ``high risk'' options are under consideration, the
newspaper said.
   The Times quoted an unidentified source as calling the operation
``an unimpeded effort to try to topple Noriega.''
   ``We're going into it with the understanding that there may be
loss of life, though the effort will be not to kill anyone,'' the
source told the Times.
   A White House press spokesman was not immediately available for
comment on the report.
   The United States has been trying to force Noriega from power
since he was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988
by federal grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   After a coup by members of the Panama Defense Forces on Oct. 3
failed, congressional critics assailed the Bush Administration for
its restrained response to that attempt.
   Bush administration officials outlined the current operation
three weeks ago before the Senate and House intelligence
committees, the Times said. The officials made it clear that the
administration is no longer willing to negotiate an alternative
that would allow Noriega to avoid criminal prosecution in the
United States.

   The Bush administration's nominee to head the
nation's nuclear arms production says he unavoidably made enemies
during 23 years as a regulator of atomic power, but that charges of
professional misconduct are unfounded.
   ``It's a bum rap,'' Victor Stello Jr. said at his confirmation
hearing Wednesday, acknowledging that his personality played a part
in having gained many enemies.
   ``I say what I think ... I'm aggressive, I'm not a diplomat ...
I can be abrasive,'' he said, adding that he was fully committed to
ensuring safe nuclear operations.
   Stello rebutted several charges raised by Democratic members of
the Senate Armed Services Committee, including that he was too cozy
with the utilities he was responsible for regulating while chief of
staff of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
   The committee scheduled a further hearing for this afternoon to
take testimony from individuals who asked to speak either in favor
or against the Stello nomination.
   The committee chairman, Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said a third session
was likely Friday, and that Stello might be asked to return for
additional testimony. That appeared to mean the administration
stood little chance of gaining full Senate confirmation of Stello
before Congress recesses for the year, probably next week.
   Democratic Sens. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Timothy
Wirth of Colorado told Stello they would vote against his
nomination as assistant energy secretary for defense programs. Sen.
John Glenn of Ohio strongly hinted he would, too.
   Kennedy accused Stello of ``corruption of the processes and
procedures'' of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and said he
``bears a major share of the responsibility'' for an erosion of
public confidence in the regulation of nuclear power.
   ``Few nominees have arrived before this committee with a longer
train of excess baggage than Victor Stello Jr.,'' Kennedy said. ``I
intend to oppose this nomination.''
   Stello has been the NRC's chief of staff, ranking below only the
five commissioners, since 1986. He was nominated for the Energy
Department job July 24.
   If confirmed, Stello would be responsible for nuclear weapons
production, the main activity of the Energy Department. Key
facilities in the weapons complex, which comprises 17 major plants
in 12 states, have been shut down in recent months because of
severe safety, management and environmental problems.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins made an unusual personal plea
on behalf of the nominee, telling the committee he had no
reservations about Stello's fitness to serve.
   ``I am more convinced today than ever before that he is the
right man for the job,'' Watkins said.
   The charges against Stello include allegations that he
improperly advised the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1986 on how to
respond to an NRC investigation of TVA's nuclear program, and that
he authorized cash payments for information from a former utility
worker in 1988 in an effort to undermine an NRC investigator.
   Stello said he could assure the committee that those and other
allegations were groundless.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
committee, said he saw no reason for Congress to question Bush's
judgment in choosing Stello, but several Democrats said many doubts
about Stello's fitness had not been dispelled.

   Congressional approval of a $305 billion
defense bill that slashes President Bush's request for the
Strategic Defense Initiative has left even the strongest backers of
Star Wars doubting its future.
   ``Why waste money for SDI if it's not the president's intention,
or the Congress' intention, to deploy,'' Sen. Malcolm Wallop,
R-Wyo., asked Wednesday, shortly before the Senate overwhelmingly
agreed to the fiscal 1990 military bill.
   The legislation, approved 91-8, cuts $1.1 billion from the
president's proposal of $4.9 billion for SDI, about $279 million
less than the fiscal 1989 amount and the first budget reduction in
the program in six years.
   Bush is expected to sign the bill, which trimmed his request for
other major strategic programs such as the MX and Midgetman nuclear
missiles and the B-2 stealth bomber.
   The House, meanwhile, approved by voice vote a companion
military spending bill that provides the money to implement the
policies in the defense legislation.
   The $286 billion spending bill, which goes to the Senate for its
consideration, largely mirrors the defense legislation on funds for
SDI, land-based nuclear missiles and the B-2 bomber.
   The House eliminated a handful of contentious issues, including
an amendment providing House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., with
an Air Force C-20 aircraft at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland,
ready at his request.
   The substitute amendment allows Foley the use of an Air Force
aircraft when he needs it, consistent with current practice.
   Among the other prickly issues dropped from the bill was an
amendment providing a classified amount of money for the SR-71 spy
plane, a program the administration decided to cancel.
   However, lawmakers may have created more problems when they
eliminated about $90 million earmarked for university projects in
the home districts of House and Senate members.
   The spending bill cuts $400 million from the administration's
request for $1.8 billion for procurement of the Trident 2 missile
and $11 million from the administration's $216 million request for
testing the troubled missile.
   That bill also prohibits spending more than $250 million on the
program until three successful flight tests have occurred. In
August, the weapon suffered its second successive failure in
undersea test firings, exploding seconds after being launched.
   In the Senate, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, said the defense bill ``continues
strategic modernization at a somewhat slower rate than the
administration sought.''
   But Wallop bemoaned the fate of SDI particularly in light of the
Republican administration's inaction.
   ``I must fault the administration for failing to fight harder
for SDI funding and not sticking to their own pronouncements on the
importance of the program,'' said Wallop, who voted against the
bill.
   Overall, the bills provide $4.3 billion for the B-2, $430
million less than the administration requested for the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   Money is included for two bombers in fiscal 1990, one less than
the administration sought, but adopts Bush's proposal for
components for five bombers in fiscal 1991.
   Approximately $1.1 billion is included for two land-based
nuclear missiles: the multiple-warhead, rail-based MX and the
single-warhead, truck-based Midgetman. The bills trim about $150
million from the administration's request for the two weapons and
includes House language imposing a 50-missile cap on the MX.
   The legislation provides for the Navy's F-14D Tomcat jet fighter
and the AHIP helicopter _ for one more year _ and postpones a
decision on the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and the Phoenix missile.
   The bills accept the administration's plan to kill six other
programs, including the SSN-688 submarine, the F-15 aircraft and
the M-88 tank recovery vehicle.

<HEAD>Polish Aid Bill Sidetracked</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just hours after Polish labor leader Lech
Walesa made a passionate plea for U.S. funds, a foreign aid bill
offering the first installment of that help was sidetracked by an
unrelated abortion dispute in the Senate.
   The domestic politics of one of America's most volatile issues
intervened late Wednesday to send the $14.6 billion foreign aid
measure back to the House for further action as Walesa dined with
lawmakers in the Capitol just a few yards from the Senate floor.
   While the bill, which provides military and economic aid in the
coming year to U.S. friends and allies around the globe, still was
expected to pass, further delays could throw prospects for $533
million in aid to Poland and Hungary into doubt for this year.
   Earlier in the day, Walesa appealed in strong terms for U.S.
financial support and investment to keep Poland's dramatic changes
alive. Some lawmakers in the audience sported lapel buttons that
read, ``Make the check to Lech.''
   The issue that delayed the bill was a Senate provision to send
$15 million to the United Nations Population Fund, a family
planning agency that has been barred from receiving U.S. funds for
five years because it operates in China, which has repressive
population control policies.
   Anti-abortion forces object to the money because of China's
one-child-per-family policy, which they say has led to forced
abortions and sterilizations.
   The House had effectively deleted the money a day earlier, but
the Senate voted 52-44 to insist it remain in the bill. Proponents
pointed out that the bill would bar any of the U.S. contribution
from being used in China.
   Another provision added in the Senate on Wednesday also could
cause problems for the bill, a ban on counting illegal aliens in
the upcoming national Census. The measure was pushed by Sen.
Richard Shelby, D-Ala., and approved on a 50-48 vote.
   Throughout the day Wednesday, House and Senate negotiators also
talked informally in an effort to come to agreement on separate
legislation setting the shape and size of an overall three-year aid
package for Poland and Hungary. The Senate had passed a version
totaling $738 million, the House an $838 million bill.
   Both Poland and Hungary have led the way in the political and
economic reform movement sweeping Eastern Europe, and Congress has
sought to encourage the changes with U.S. aid.
   The money bill also remained subject to a veto threat because of
a provision stemming from the Iran-Contra scandal that would bar
use of foreign aid to entice other countries to carry out policies
contrary to U.S. law. The administration believed the language
would tie its hands in dealings with allies.

   It's tiring being the toast of Washington, so
Lech Walesa called it a day early and missed some of the accolades
being heaped upon him.
   Walesa, exhausted after a day in which he made a triumphant
appearance before Congress, abruptly left a dinner in his honor at
the Capitol on Wednesday night, saying he was too tired to continue.
   ``The day has taken some toll and he is tired and he regrets
having to depart,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.
   A glittering assembly had gathered in Statuary Hall to hail the
leader of Poland's Solidarity labor union as the hero of the day.
   However, the dinner continued after Walesa left and Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., his voice quavering and his eyes brimming
with tears, expressed the pride he said all Polish-Americans feel
at Walesa's achievements.
   ``Lech Walesa today made a speech that was so simple, so direct,
so honest,'' Rostenkowski said. ``He is a man who says, I know what
freedom is because I haven't had it.''
   Walesa, at a luncheon after his address before Congress,
described his speech simply:
   ``It was too long. I am not a good speaker.''
   Not too long by Senate standards, said Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell of Maine. ``By those standards it was a very short
speech.''
   ``In addition, he had something to say,'' said Senate Republican
Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Dole said that as Walesa walked into the House chamber he turned
to him and said:
   ``If the lights go out, I can fix them before I give the speech.
I would like you to understand, I really am an electrician; I never
wanted to be a diplomat.''
   He had never understood, he said, ``how much responsibility''
one takes on when one assumes the role of a leader.
   Now, he said, ``I must be what you want me to be.''
   Walesa, who spoke through an interpreter, said he could not
pronounce the names of his hosts.
   But in many cases he was wrong.
   Seated near him were Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security
adviser in the Carter administration; Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska; Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and many other
Polish-Americans of achievement and rank.
   Rostenkowski led a standing ovation on the House floor when
Walesa described Solidarity's long battle for survival and its
eventual triumph and said:
   ``We did not smash a single window pane. But we were stubborn,
very stubborn, ready to suffer. We knew what we wanted. And our
power prevailed in the end.''
   Walesa's speech had personal meaning for many.
   Ms. Mikulski wore her great-grandmother's scarf, hand
embroidered with the arms of Poland, and handed down in her family,
daughter to daughter.
   ``His triumph is the fulfillment of a dream that my family have
had for more than 100 years _ that Poland is free and on the way to
democracy,'' the senator said.

<HEAD>Nikkei Closes at Another High, Dollar Edges Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed at
yet another high Thursday, while the dollar edged up against the
yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 24.11 points, or 0.07
percent, to close at 35,876.34, the fourth straight record high
since Monday. The index had gained 83.59 points for the previous
record, closing at 35,852.23 Wednesday.
   The dollar ended at 143.85 yen, up 0.48 yen from the previous
day's 143.37-yen finish. The currency started at 143.83 yen in
Tokyo and ranged between 143.75 yen and 144.00 yen.
   The Nikkei's rise followed an overnight gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average of 30 major issues in New York.
   The index erased some of its gains as the yen's weakness against
the dollar discouraged market players, said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a
dealer with Daiwa Securities Co.
   Other dealers said sales for profit taking by some investors
also helped narrow the index's gains.
   ``Although the index's gain is not that big, trading was pretty
active,'' Suzuki said.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was slowly getting stronger
against the yen as many investors expected the U.S. trade deficit
in September to shrink from the previous month, dealers said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department is to announce its monthly trade
statistics in Washington later Thursday. The figures are seen as a
major economic indicator of the U.S. economy.
   A Bank of Tokyo trader anonymously said market players were
reluctant to make major moves and currency rates moved narrowly
prior to the trade figure announcement.

   The future of cease-fire talks between
Nicaragua's rival factions is in question today after Sandinista
delegates said the Contra rebels had second thoughts just when an
agreement seemed within reach.
   The key element of an eight-point draft proposal, a copy of
which was obtained by The Associated Press, called for the
withdrawal of 2,000 Contra forces from Nicaragua to rebel camps in
Honduras as part of a cease-fire agreement.
   The proposal was the principal working document of the two sides
as they met Wednesday for the fifth time in seven days in an
attempt to restore the truce President Daniel Ortega suspended Nov.
1.
   After about three hours of discussions, the Contra delegation
stunned the Sandinistas in early evening by asking for a week-long
suspension of the talks.
   ``We had made a lot of progress today,'' said the chief
Sandinista negotiator, Victor Hugo Tinoco. ``It was a total
surprise that they decided to break off the talks.''
   But Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros denied that significant
progress had been made, asserting that statements to the contrary
``were not accurate'' and that the Sandinista negotiators showed a
lack of flexibility in the discussions.
   He defended the call for a recess by saying that after many
hours of talks dating back to last Thursday, a time for
``reflection'' was appropriate.
   After rethinking their earlier proposal for a seven-day recess,
the Contras announced after 11 p.m. that they would return this
morning to discuss next steps with the Sandinistas and with
Organization of American States and United Nations mediators.
   The scene of the talks was an eight-story OAS office building
three blocks from the White House.
   There was a bizarre twist when, according to Tinoco, the Contra
delegation asked for a 30-minute recess to talk things over among
themselves only to disappear for two hours.
   ``We don't know where they are,'' Tinoco told reporters shortly
after 10 p.m. ``They are somewhere in this building.'' He and
fellow delegates then left for their hotel.
   The Contra decision to ask for a week's recess just when the
talks seemed on the verge of success, prompted Sandinista
speculation that a hidden State Department hand had nipped the
proposal in the bud.
   Sandinista partisans prowled stairwells throughout the building
searching for U.S. diplomats but came up empty-handed. The official
U.S. policy is that the State Department gives advice to the
Contras but is not directly involved in the discussions.
   Restoring the cease fire is considered an important goal because
national elections are set for Nicaragua on Feb. 25.
   An American negotiator for the Sandinistas, Paul Reichler,
sounded incredulous when he talked to reporters about the perceived
change of Contra attitudes.
   ``On the verge of reaching an agreement, they're breaking off
the talks,'' he said. ``It does not make sense unless the Contras
do not want an agreement of any kind.''
   He wondered whether the sudden appearance at the talks of Contra
chief of staff Israel Galeano, otherwise known as Comandante
Franklin, was related to the rebel retreat.
   Other key points in the draft proposal included:
   _Verification of the cease fire by a United Nations force
scheduled to take up peacekeeping duties in Central America shortly.
   _A pledge by the Contras not to dispatch any forces into
Nicaragua from base camps in Honduras, in addition to withdrawing
2,000 of their estimated 5,000 troops based in Nicaragua.
   _A request to Central American presidents to extend from Dec. 5
the deadline set Aug. 7 for concluding the demobilization of the
Contras.
   _A Contra delegation would travel to Nicaragua in the last week
of November to determine if political conditions will permit the
safe return to Nicaragua of rebel combatants.

<HEAD>FDA Warns Against Mail-Order `Immunization Kits'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is warning
that some mail-order ``immunization kits'' claiming to protect
children from diseases such as polio and measles contain only sugar
pills and solutions of alcohol and water.
   ``These kits and pills offer no protection,'' FDA Commissioner
Frank Young said Wednesday.
   The FDA advised parents who used the kits, marketed by an Idaho
company, to have their children immunized as soon as possible.
   The kits were discovered last month during a search by the Idaho
State Attorney General's Office at the office, laboratory and
health food store of J.S. Inc. of Twin Falls, Idaho, and the E.F.
Skilling Co. of Buhl, Idaho, a device manufacturer.
   J.S. Inc. is the distribution company of James D. Solomon, the
FDA said.
   Solomon, who was arrested on Idaho state charges, says he is a
``naturopath,'' the FDA said. Naturopathy is a method of treating
diseases with food and exercise to assist the natural healing
process.
   Distribution records indicated kits were sent to naturopaths,
parents and regional distributors in Florida, Kansas, Ohio, South
Carolina, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

<NOTE>Petitions Filed to Allow Competition in Local Telephone Access</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Metropolitan Fiber Systems Inc. is asking the
Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission to allow
alternative telecommunications carriers to compete for local
telephone access services.
   The regional Bell and other operating companies provide local
phone access for all long-distance carriers. Nearly 50 cents of
every dollar spent on long-distance services goes to the Bell
companies for access fees, totaling about $20 billion a year.
   Anthony J. Pompliano, president of MFS, based in the Chicago
suburb of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill., said Wednesday his company was
asking the Justice Department ``to enforce the Modified Final
Judgment to require that local access ... be `unbundled' to the
fullest extent possible to permit fair and equitable competition.''
   Also, he said, ``we are asking the FCC to mandate that
alternative local telecommunications carriers can cost-effectively
interconnect'' and locate equipment at Bell facilities.
   ``That means MFS and similar alternative carriers can install
their equipment in Bell-owned switch sites and hook up to the user
community via the Bell network,'' Pompliano said.
   A. Gray Collins, Bell Atlantic senior vice president for
external affairs, said MFS was ``free to use Bell Atlantic's
services any way it wants, and it is free to connect its own
network with Bell Atlantic's.''
   ``Metropolitan Fiber, however, is demanding more than this. It
is demanding collocation, which is, in effect, the ability to set
up their shop in our store. Bell Atlantic has no legal obligation
to do this, but it has agreed to meet a number of Metropolitan's
requests,'' Collins said.

wounded.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush called

   Bush also pledged the United States would continue to speak out

   A tornado slammed into a shopping
district, a residential area and a school Wednesday, killing at
least 15 people, injuring more than 300 and trapping people in cars
and homes, authorities said.
   ``It's total destruction where the tornado hit. Cars are piled
on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to
be,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in
Montgomery.
   Emergency officials in Huntsville reported 15 confirmed deaths,
said Henry Jurnigan, a duty officer with the state Emergency
Management Agency in Montgomery. Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305
people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that
struck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled with
rush-hour traffic.
   Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched the rubble
through the night for injured or dead.
   ``Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment
complexes and shopping areas,'' said police spokesman Ben Jennings
after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in the
city's south section.
   ``It may be tomorrow before we have a final count,'' Gov. Guy
Hunt said at the state's disaster center in Montgomery.
   The governor dispatched 50 National Guardsmen, along with search
and rescue equipment.
   Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, and
Cooper said police were unable to determine the extent of the
damaged area. Rescuers also were hampered by darkness and plunging
temperatures.
   ``We're even having a few snowflakes,'' said Cooper. High
temperatures in Huntsville were expected to be in the 30s Thursday,
he said.
   Witnesses said the downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the
Waterford Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were
reduced to rubble by the tornado.
   ``The only thing left standing was a door frame,'' news
photographer Mike Mercier said of the school, which was empty of
staff and pupils when the tornado hit. Police reported one person
killed in a car outside the school.
   Authorities said at least five were killed at Waterford Square
apartments, three at a business school, Southern Junior College,
which is located in a converted movie theater, and others in
scattered areas.
   ``Rescuers are digging in the rubble,'' state trooper W.L. Kelly
said. He said two people were killed when the twister hit house
trailers in rural areas east of Huntsville. The fifth death was
reported near the shopping district.
   The city is home to Marshall Space Flight Center and the Army's
Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from the space
agency or weapons testing center.
   ``We've called in troopers from around the state to help,''
Kelly said.
   Telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the
tornadoes and WAAY-TV, the only station still broadcasting,
reported widespread damage.
   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and
it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold
of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when
the twister struck.
   ``It started picking cars up and pushing them around, ... some
of them upside down, some of them just strewn around,'' he said.
   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circus
performer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said.
   ``All of these heavy arcing, flashing lines that were just
popping and snapping over the top of us ... it was as if you were
looking into an arc-welder, they were so bright,'' he said.
   WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a
business collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area. A
nearby shopping center also was damaged.
   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors were
having difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
   The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east
Alabama hamlet of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one
home and causing some injuries. Weather officials said people were
trapped inside a collapsed house.
   A spokeswoman for the Clay County Sheriff's Department said
people were injured at one house in a rural area 30 miles east of
Sylacauga.
   Another tornado touched down about 1:30 p.m. as severe weather
swept across much of Alabama and the National Weather Service
placed most of the state under a tornado watch.
   A third tornado was reported shortly before 3:30 p.m. crossing
the Coosa River near Titus in east Alabama, the Weather Service
said.
   In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, and at
least 200 people evacuated after a tornado struck two mobile home
parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25 miles
southeast of Atlanta, authorities said.
   Authorities in southwestern North Carolina said a pair of
storm-spawned tornadoes struck around 10:45 p.m., destroying a
vacant house in Henderson County.
   The National Weather Service also reported tornadoes inflicting
minor property damage in Kentucky and Mississippi.

<TEXT>
   Toxic waste sites at 27 Defense Department and
Energy Department facilities are being added to the priority list
for cleanup under the federal Superfund program, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   The federal facilities were among 29 sites added to the list
Wednesday, bringing the total number of sites scheduled for
priority cleanup to 1,219. Of those, 79 sites are on facilities
belonging to the federal government.
   The latest to be added included toxic waste sites at 19 Defense
Department facilities and eight Energy Department facilities
including a number of atomic weapons manufacturing or processing
plants.
   Concern about hazardous wastes at the atomic weapons plants has
previously been made public.
   The two non-government sites added to the list were the Forest
Glen Mobile Home subdivision in Niagara Falls, N.Y., and the Radium
Chemical site in New York City.
   Earlier this year the Department of Health and Human Services
recommended that residents of the two sites be moved because of a
threat to public health.
   Last February the EPA, acting under an emergency provision,
removed waste material that was believed to be the source of
unhealthy levels of radiation at the Radium Chemical site in New
York. Adding the site to the Superfund list will allow completion
of the cleanup of the contaminated building, officials said.
   The Department of Health and Human Services issued a health
advisory to residents of the Forest Glen mobile home subdivision in
Niagara Falls last July because of concern about contamination from
toxic materials in the soil.
   The EPA offered to temporarily relocate residents, but it was
not known Wednesday how many of the residents had moved.
   Here are the Defense Department facilities at which hazardous
wastes sites were added to the cleanup list:
   Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska; Williams AFB, Arizona; Barstow
Marine Corps Logistics Base, Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base,
March AFB, Travis AFB, all in California; Treasure Island Naval
Station, San Francisco;
   Air Force Plant (RJKS), Waterton, Colo.; Cecil Field Naval Air
Station, and Jacksonville Naval Air Station, both Jacksonville,
Fla.; Pensacola Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Fla.; Marine Corps
Logistics Base, Albany, Ga.; Fort Devens, Mass.; Otis Air National
Guard (Camp Edwards), Falmouth, Mass.; Naval Industrial Reserve
Ordnance, Fridley, Minn.; Plattsburgh AFB, N.Y.; Davisville Naval
Construction Battery Center, North Kingstown, R.I.; Newport Naval
Education and Training Center, Newport, R.I.; Fort Lewis Logistics
Center, Tillicum, Wash.
   Here are the Energy Department facilities:
   Idaho National Engine Laboratory, Idaho Falls, Idaho; Brookhaven
National Laboratory, Upton, N.Y.; Feed Materials Production Center,
Fernald, Ohio; Mound Plant, Miamisburg, Ohio; Savannah River Site,
Aiken, Ga.; Oak Ridge Reservation, Oak Ridge, Tenn.; Monticello

   Maria Zubarria of apartment 43
in Zacamil's housing block 111A is swollen like a bullfrog's throat
because her cancer treatment is three days overdue.
   Juan Alberto Ponce has carried a white flag up and down
Conacaste's alleys No. 3 and 4 dozens of times searching in vain
for a way through fierce combat to alley 8, where his family has
been holed up for four days.
   Dr. Ricardo Mendez of Soyapango's Psychiatric Hospital has
worked since Sunday without sleep and for two days without food
because the hospital is in the middle of an urban battlefield and
relief for him and his staff has not arrived.
   Though hundreds of leftist guerrillas and soldiers of the
rightist government have been killed and wounded in this week's
battle for San Salvador, it is the capital's civilian population
that is taking the brunt of the suddenly and drastically escalated
civil war.
   More than 100 non-combatants have been killed, and civilians
make up about half the 1,600 total wounded, according to
still-sketchy casualty figures on fighting that began Saturday
night.
   President Alfredo Cristiani has accused insurgents of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front of entrenching themselves
in densely populated working-class neighborhoods so they are
shielded by non-combatants.
   The presence of thousands of civilians around dug-in rebels has
not prevented the government from sending rocket-firing helicopters
and warplanes with heavy-caliber machine guns against guerrilla
strongholds.
   Thousands of homes have been damaged or wrecked in nearly
continuous strafing of the outlying neighborhoods where the
insurgents are making a stand.
   A reporter races across the clearing separating Zacamil's
six-story apartment complexes from the barricaded streets, assault
rifle fire ringing through the passages between the buildings and
smacking into their facades.
   Guerrillas keep watch at both ends of each floor, sighting down
their Soviet-desgined AK-47s toward soldiers up the road and
occassionally squeezing off short bursts.
   Eduardo Rodriguez, who lives in apartment 42, next to the
cancer-stricken Mrs. Zubarria, crouches behind the low wall of the
fourth floor hallway.
   ``We want to get out of here,'' he says, under his breath so the
guerrillas a few yards away don't hear, to the just-arrived
reporter.
   Later, inside his small apartment with his wife, Adriana, and
their children, he tells how they have almost run out of water and
are low on tortillas, the only food they have left.
   ``They won't let us leave,'' says Mrs. Rodriguez softly, with a
gesture with her chin toward the external hallway where the rebels
crouch. ``We're their protection.''
   Alberto Davila finally decided to take up what he and his wife,
Angela, could carry from their home in Conacaste early Wednesday
and flee along with thousands of others who streamed out of the
neighborhood beneath white flags.
   Mrs. Davila, tears streaming down her face, clutched her
6-year-old daughter's hand as they paused in their flight.
   ``It's terrible, it's terrible,'' she sobbed as several
residents hurried by with an improvised stretcher carrying a
middle-aged woman, her jaw blown off by a bullet or shrapnel. Deep
in shock, she sat straight-backed on the rig and stared straight
ahead with glazed eyes.
   ``We stayed this long because we didn't want to leave the house
abandoned,'' said Davila.
   Mrs. Rodriguez of Zacamil echoed that sentiment.
   She and her family have hung on in Zacamil despite the combat
``because once we leave, we must be resigned to losing everything.
They'll just take it all. But now, we're willing to go with just
the clothes we have on.''
   Perhaps the only civilians in Soyapango not distraught by the
death and destruction surrounding them this week are the catatonics
or severely psychotics among the 360 patients at Dr. Mendez's
hospital.
   But oblivion or delusion cannot keep them entirely immune from
the war and its consequences.
   They have not eaten in more than 48 hours either.

<HEAD>Study: Drug Slows Parkinson's Disease</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drug recently approved for Parkinson's disease
appears to be the first to slow down the crippling disorder and may
be the first effective treatment for a degenerative brain ailment,
a major study today confirms.
   The study conducted on 800 people began in 1987 and was
scheduled to continue until late next year. But because of the
drug's dramatic effect, the researchers ended the study in February
in order to provide the medicine to the patients in the control
group, which received placebos.
   The drug, deprenyl, helped prevent people from becoming sick
enough to require levodopa, the standard medicine for symptoms of
the incurable disease that afflicts about 500,000 Americans.
   ``It does not stop the disease,'' said Dr. Ira Shoulson. ``But
it may well slow the disease. This may be the first treatment for a
neurodegenerative disorder that actually slows the disease.''
   Until now, levodopa had been the main treatment, easing symptoms
but not slowing the disease. Doctors usually refrain from
prescribing levodopa until relatively severe symptoms develop
because it loses its effectiveness after about a year.
   The study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, was
conducted by members of the Parkinson Study Group at 28 medical
centers in the United States and Canada.
   The researchers wrote that ``the results translate into a delay
in the development of disability of nearly one year and an extended
capacity for full-time employment.''
   ``Over 12 years, this might buy 50 percent more time of less
impaired disability,'' said Shoulson, who directed the study at the
University of Rochester Medical Center.
   In the research, 399 people with early, untreated Parkinson's
were given deprenyl, while 401 others received another experimental
medicine or dummy pills. During the followup, 97 of those who got
deprenyl worsened enough to need levodopa, compared with 176 in the
comparison group.
   The doctors are not sure how the deprenyl prevented the patients
from reaching their need for levodopa.
   The disease attacks the brain and results in symptoms such as
shuffling gait, shaking and difficulty talking. It typically
strikes people in their 50s and 60s.
   At the start of the study, people's symptoms included mild
tremors, stiffness and slow movement. By the time they needed
levodopa, they often had to stop working or had trouble caring for
themselves.
   Deprenyl, sold under the brand name Eldepryl, was approved by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine use in September.
   In a separate study, scientists at the University of California,
San Diego said that genetically modified cells grafted into the
brains of rats had reduced the animal's symptoms of Parkinson's
disease.
   The researchers, whose results were published Wednesday in
Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, said the implanted
cells were genetically altered to produce a chemical lacking in the
brains of Parkinson's patients.
   The research may help provide an alternative to fetal cell
implants, which have proven effective but is embroiled in the
abortion controversy. The Bush administration this month extended a
ban on federal financing of research in which human fetal tissue
from induced abortions is transplanted into human patients.
   The scientists genetically altered the rats' skin cells to make
them produce L-dopa, a chemical that is lacking in the brain of
Parkinson's patients. Levodopa is the synthetic drug used as a
substitute for L-dopa to treat the disease.
   When the genetically altered cells were transplanted into the
rats' brains, an average 40 percent reduction in abnormal behavior
was seen, said UCSD neuroscientist Fred Gage.

<HEAD>Nikkei Sets Another Record, Dollar Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index closed at a
fourth straight record high today, while the dollar rose against
the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average added 24.11 points, or 0.07
percent, ending the day at 35,876.34. On Wednesday, the index
gained 83.59 points.
   The dollar ended trading at 143.85 yen, up 0.48 yen from its
143.37-yen finish on Wednesday. The U.S. currency opened at 143.83
yen and ranged between 143.75 and 144.00 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen rate moved inside a very tight range,'' said
Minori Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   The dollar opened higher in Tokyo following its overnight rise
in New York, and then rose further because the Tokyo market
expected a decrease in the U.S. trade deficit for September, other
dealers said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department was to announce its monthly trade
statistics in Washington later today.
   The Bank of Japan reportedly sold the dollar to slow its rise
shortly after the currency touched the 144.00-yen mark at late
morning. The central bank does not usually comment on its monetary
actions.
   Ms. Takeuchi said current economic factors were negative for
dollar buying. But she said investors probably would not abandon
the U.S. currency, mainly because of expectations of further
U.S-Soviet arms reductions, which are seen as a remedy for the U.S.
trade deficit.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei index first rose in early
trading following overnight gains in the Dow Jones average of 30
major industrial issues in New York, but then lost more than half
its initial gains.
   ``The index stopped rising as the yen touched 144 yen and
discouraged market players,'' said Masaya Hashizume, a dealer with
Nikko Securities.
   He said a lack of direction in trading also contributed to the
small gains. ``Participants kept changing their buying targets,''
he said.
   ``Investors were trying to sell for profit-taking whenever they
could,'' Hashizume said. He said participants also were concerned
about the forthcoming U.S. trade figures.
   An estimated 1.1 billion shares changed hands on the market's
first section, down from Wednesday's 1.2 billion. Among the winners
were real estate and railways issues.

<TEXT>
   Causing a stir in the Italian cultural world, a new
book and a newspaper have disclosed that Nobel laureate Eugenio
Montale signed literary articles that were actually written by a
friend.
   The country's literati had considered Montale the leading
Italian poet of the 20th century.
   The Milan-based newspaper Il Giornale recently published a
series of letters Montale wrote in 1950 to an American friend,
Henry Furst, asking him to put together several book reviews that
would appear under Montale's name.
   The deal also was detailed in a book about Furst published this
month, ``Dry Branches,'' by Mario Soldati.
   The disclosures surprised Italians, who grew up revering the
verses of the reclusive Montale, including ``Occasions,''
``Finisterre'' and a collection titled ``Cuttlefish Bones.''
   Montale, who often wrote of the sea in his native Genoa, won the
Nobel Prize in literature in 1975. He died in 1981 at age 85.
   Most commentators have expressed sympathy for Montale, who,
according to Soldati, arranged for the ghost-written articles
during a period in which he was very tired and felt unable to write.
   Another controversy has developed over a column by an Italian
Communist politician and poet, Pietro Ingrao, who said Montale had
a ``right to deceive,'' since capitalist society did not permit an
artist to make a living from poetry.
   In the letters published in Il Giornale, Montale told Furst he
could not fulfill his contract to write a monthly review of an
English or American book for the prestigious Milan newspaper
Corriere della Sera.
   The poet asked the American writer to do it for him, and
promised to turn over the payment he would have received.
   ``The problem for me is the reading, not the writing of the
article,'' Montale wrote, according to the published letters.
   ``It takes me a lot of effort even to read an Italian book,
imagine an English book! No one can imagine the life I am leading;
and if they knew _ at the newspaper _ instead of feeling sorry for
me they would show me the door.''
   Montale said he wanted to keep the contract with the newspaper
since he did not have much income.
   ``In time I will do the work, but now ... it is already
something if I don't imitate Pavese,'' he wrote, referring to the
well-known writer Cesare Pavese.
   In other letters, Montale thanks Furst for sending reviews,
cautions him not to make them too elegant and says that he has
given a more positive tone to Furst's review of a book by Ernest
Hemingway, ``since I know the author and I am part of a jury for
the prize named after him.''
   Furst, an author in his own right, was close friends with many
European writers in the 1950s and served for a time as literary
correspondent from Italy for The New York Times, according to Il
Giornale.
   ``The Montale case ... has become an occasion for raising again
the inexhaustible arguments about the shadowy collaborators of the
greats of literature,'' said the Italian weekly newsmagazine
Panorama.
   Ingrao said in a front-page article in the Communist newspaper
Il Manifesto that Montale had the right to deceive his newspaper,
``being that we are not able or willing to guarantee a poet even
the liberty to search, to interrogate, to interrogate himself, in
idleness.''
   He described Montale's act as rebellion against a consumer
society.
   But columnist Paolo Mieli responded in the Turin-based daily La
Stampa: ``There remains the sensation that this attempt to cast the
episode in terms of politics and ideology is false, above all when
compared with the intense drama of those long-ago letters to
Furst.''

   The wounded come in waves. They
have been coming for days and Hospital Rosales is stretched past
the limit.
   ``We need anesthestics. We need antibiotics. We need bandages,''
Dr. Melvin Guardado, the head of emergency services said. ``And
blood? There isn't any blood. On blood, we're done for.''
   Guardado moves aside as yet another stretcher bearing yet
another wounded civilian comes through the open door.
   People huddle outside in groups. A woman cries. The day is
steamy. A thin film of sweat coats the doctor's face.
   ``There are people are coming in from Mejicanos, from
Soyapango,'' he says.
   ``The fighting is heavy there. We understand there are a lot
more waiting to be evacuated but the ambulances can't get in.''
   Guerrillas from the Marxist-led Farabundo Marti National
Liberation have been entrenched in heavily populated northern
neighborhoods like Soyapango and Mejicanos since Saturday.
   The air force has been using warplanes armed with .50-caliber
Gatling guns and helicopter gunships with .30-caliber machines guns
on the areas.
   Guardado takes a drag on his cigarette, watching attendants
wrestle yet another stretcher off the back of a pickup. Soldiers
and police posted in the emergency room watch too.
   Some patients are questioned as well as treated. The army says
wounded guerrillas are being evacuated from battle zones as
civilians.
   ``The surveillance is intense,'' the doctor murmurs as a police
officer moves in on a stretcher bearing a young man shot in the leg.
   Guardado has been a surgeon in San Salvador for 23 years. He's
lived through a decade of war. He manned the emergency room in the
devastating 1986 earthquake. He thought he'd seen it all.
   Until Saturday night, that is, when leftist rebels brought their
war against the U.S.-backed government to the capital.
   ``It wasn't this bad in the earthquake,'' Guardado says. ``I've
never seen anything like it.''
   Rosales, the main civilian hospital in San Salvador, has treated
more than 400 civilian casualties since the offensive began.
   ``Gunshot wounds,'' Guardado says. ``Almost all of them are
gunshot wounds.''
   The 400-bed public hospital, which has eight operating rooms,
can muster about 25 residents, interns and medical students at any
one time. In between the waves of wounded, they try to get some
rest.
   ``Some of the staff is living here at the hospital,'' Guardado
says. ``We have others who can't get to the hospital because of the
fighting. We have a lot of tired people.''
   In a corner of the teeming emergency room, Jose Antonio Canas
watches attendants hovering over his wife, Lidia. She has been shot
in the stomach.
   ``She went to the door to see what was going on,'' he says. ``We
don't know where the bullet came from.''
   The couple and their three teen-age children live in Mejicanos,
the scene of some of the heaviest and most sustained combat.
   Why didn't they leave?
   ``Where were we going to go?'' Canas asks. ``There is fighting
everywhere.''
   He looks at his wife. She is 45. They have been married since
they were teen-agers.
   ``There is no point to this. For anyone,'' he says. ``It has to
stop.''

   Santa Claus lost his pipe, celebrities told tales of going cold
turkey and cigar-smoker Sen. Edward Kennedy proposed funds for an
anti-smoking campaign as millions of American smokers today felt
the heat not to light up.
   On street corners and in offices and hospitals, the country's
non-smoking majority encouraged smokers to snub out their
cigarettes today for the 13th annual Great American Smokeout.
   The American Cancer Society, the Smokeout sponsor, hoped that 10
million of the country's 50 million smokers would give up their
smokes for at least 24 hours.
   The organization estimates that 29 percent of the population
smoke. Four decades ago, 41 percent did.
   ``The people that are smoking now are ... pretty hard core,''
said Mike Madden, a spokesman for the Minnesota Lung Association.
   He and other activists said smokers may need an excuse such as
today's events to break their nicotine addiction.
   But inside Maine's 43 hospitals there'll be no excuse. The
nation's strictest anti-smoking law went into effect today, banning
smoking at hospitals. The only exceptions were for patients with
written permission from a doctor, and then only in designated areas.
   Hospital officials were armed with carrot sticks, popcorn,
crossword puzzles and advice on giving up smoking. Smokers were
being shown the door.
   But physicians who treat people for drug or alcohol dependency
say they are not sure how they will cope with the law.
   ``It's a real moral dilemma,'' said Dr. George Dreher of St.
Mary's Hospital in Lewiston. ``I've had patients walk out of detox
when they found out they couldn't smoke. So what's my priority?''
   In the Philadelphia area, hospitals were setting up clinics
offering advice on how to stop smoking. Many restaurants banned
smoking, Temple University traded pencils for cigarettes and U.S.
Healthcare gave out apples.
   Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop today was to hand
out ``I'm a Born Non-Smoker'' T-shirts for newborns at a Washington
area hospital.
   He joined Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat, at a news
conference Wednesday to announce legislation that would call for
$185 million in federal spending next year on an anti-smoking
advertising campaign; grants to states, schools and businesses that
promote anti-smoking programs; and money to establish a new Center
for Tobacco Products.
   The center would for the first time give the government
regulatory control over the contents of cigarettes.
   ``It's about time that the federal government stood up to be
counted on a product that kills 390,000 people every year,'' Koop
said.
   Kennedy called cigarettes ``a form of death.'' Then he said he
would try to kick his cigar habit.
   Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory
disease. The surgeon general has warned of the potentially fatal
risks of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine, the active
drug in cigarettes.
   The Tobacco Institute of Washington, the industry's lobbying
arm, generally does not offer a rebuttal to the Smokeout.
   In Illinois, smokers and non-smokers at Loyola University
Medical Center in Maywood today can test carbon monoxide levels in
their lungs.
   Santa's lungs got a break on Wednesday.
   In Southern California, a group of elementary school pupils
yanked the pipe from the mouth of a 8-foot-tall cutout Santa Claus
at a Pasadena shopping center.
   The mall's management decided to make Santa a non-smoker after
the cancer society passed on a complaint from a caller unhappy to
see him puffing.
   Celebrity former smokers at a New York City news conference told
tales of woe for the anti-smoking cause.
   Screen actress Sylvia Miles said she gave up cigarettes out of
embarrassment.
   ``Every year I used to say I wouldn't smoke, and then this year
I decided I was so ashamed to come here and lie, that I really
stopped,'' she said.
   ``I did it in a sneaky way,'' said actor Eli Wallach, who
stopped 25 years ago. ``I switched to little baby cigars and
inhaled those and got sicker and sicker.''
   Non-smoker Eileen Fulton of television's ``As the World Turns''
said she almost started smoking as a young actress with a chance
for a cigarette commercial.
   ``I sat down and took a big drag, right down to my heels,'' she
said. ``They said, `Oh, that's wonderful, Eileen.' Then I turned
around and passed out right on the floor.''

<HEAD>Picasso Sells for $40.7 Million</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA ROSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1905, Pablo Picasso painted ``Au Lapin
Agile,'' a Parisian tavern scene, for his suppers. In 1989,
philanthropist Walter Annenberg bought it for $40.7 million.
   The painting, in which Picasso depicts himself as a harlequin,
had been described by John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North
America, as the most important 20th-century picture to come up for
auction.
   Wednesday's price fell within the presale estimate, but left it
behind another famous self-portrait painted four years earlier.
``Yo Picasso'' sold for $47.85 million at Sotheby's in May, a
record for the artist and more than double its presale estimate.
   The record for any work of art _ $53.9 million _ was set in 1987
for Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises.''
   ``We were a little disappointed it didn't pass `Yo Picasso,'''
said John Payson, whose sister, Linda de Roulet, consigned ``Au
Lapin Agile.''
   Payson's and Mrs. de Roulet's mother, art collector and former
New York Mets owner Joan Whitney Payson, acquired the painting in
1952 for $60,000.
   She displayed it in her Long Island home and bequeathed it to
her daughter. ``Irises'' also came from the collection.
   John Payson had said his sister offered the Picasso because the
prices commanded by ``Irises'' and ``Yo Picasso'' made her ``a bit
nervous having the painting in her house.''
   Mrs. de Roulet said she would establish a foundation for medical
research and education with part of the proceeds.
   Annenberg, of Rancho Mirage, Calif., the former U.S. ambassador
to London and friend of former President Reagan, was in the auction
house but bid by phone, said Diana Brooks, president of Sotheby's
North America.
   Marion said Annenberg's collection had ``just about everything
but a great Picasso.''
   While subdued in comparison with other recent auctions,
Wednesday night's sale drew an estimated 1,500 people, totaled
$269.5 million and set records for 12 artists.
   Among other highlights:
   _Picasso's ``The Mirror,'' one of a series of portraits of
sleeping women done in 1932, sold for $26.4 million to Japanese
dealer Shigeki Kameyama.
   _Picasso's ``Mere et Enfant,'' which dates from 1921 when the
artist's son was born, sold for $18.7 million to a private Japanese
collector.
   _Edouard Manet's ``La Promenade'' sold for $14.8 million to a
Japanese dealer.
   _Van Gogh's ``Quarry near Saint-Remy,'' a landscape painted in
1889, was sold for $11.5 million to a Japanese dealer.
   All prices include a 10 percent premium.
   `Young Girls at the Piano,'' a Renoir pastel produced in 1892 on
commission from the French government, failed to sell. The Renoir
had been expected to bring up to $30 million, but the high bid was
$17.5 million.
   ``Au Lapin Agile,'' which means the agile rabbit, was the name
of the tavern frequented by Picasso.
   He painted ``Au Lapin Agile'' when he was 25. It shows him and a
woman _ model Germaine Pichot _ standing at a bar, brooding and
disenchanted with one another. Picasso had blamed Pichot for
causing his best friend's suicide.
   ``The big question in the picture is whether or not at the time
it was painted Picasso was actually having an affair with this
woman,'' Brooks said.
   A photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed
in a bar.
   ``I painted it in exchange for free meals and drinks,'' Picasso
once said.

   One year after a tornado tore through
this tiny town, wiping out a third of its homes and killing one
person, virtually the entire community came together to give thanks
to one another.
   ``The town could have laid down and died but it didn't,'' said
the Rev. Jean Latshaw, pastor of the First Baptist Church, who
helped organize Wednesday night's dinner to pay tribute to the
town's successful rebuilding.
   ``You often hear today about how terrible and mean people are to
one another, but there were some wonderful acts of kindness after
this disaster.''
   Latshaw's First Baptist Church _ the only church in town _ was
not damaged and became a beacon in the chaos that followed the
funnel. For two months, the small white church served as a 24-hour
center for meals and lodging for the homeless and cleanup crews, as
well as a distribution center for supplies such as clothing and
furniture.
   As most of the southwestern Missouri town's 230 residents packed
the church Wednesday to pay tribute to Latshaw, his wife, Wilma,
and others who helped rebuild Butterfield, a grim scene unfolded
about 450 miles to the southeast, in Huntsville, Ala.
   Rescuers there searched for bodies from a deadly tornado, one of
several that carved paths of destruction Wednesday through the
Southeast.
   In Butterfield _ so small that there's no store, stoplight or
post office _ neighbors prayed and exchanged hugs and handshakes
before sitting down to a pre-Thanksgiving meal of turkey, ham,
pumpkin pie and all the trimmings.
   ``Tonight we're saying thanks for what everybody did to help the
tornado victims,'' said Todd Mason, whose trailer home ``just
exploded'' in the twister. ``Butterfield and the church did a lot
for people.''
   Several people said Mrs. Latshaw badgered state and federal
officials to declare the region a disaster area until they did so.
Then she and city clerk Mary Boyd helped Small Business
Administration officials find dozens of residents who had left the
ravaged town to live with relatives, so they could apply for
diaster loans. In addition, a relief fund raised more than $32,000.
   ``When Wilma raised her eyebrows at the SBA people and got that
look on her face, I knew they were in trouble,'' said Mary Turner,
laughing. Mrs. Turner, whose rural home escaped damage, went daily
to the church herself to oversee the distribution of clothing.
   A Missouri House proclamation praised the Latshaws for helping
keep the community together.
   ``I got on the phone and said, `Hey, we need help,''' Mrs.
Latshaw said. ``People didn't have anything, not anything left.''
   ``It was a mess,'' Latshaw said. ``Wire, roofs, timbers
everywhere. Houses and trailer houses looked like they'd been run
through a shredder.''
   All but five of the 34 homes destroyed have been rebuilt, but
signs of the devastation are still evident. Trees lie scattered
around town, along with boards, broken glass and trashed cars. A
piece of sheet metal is wrapped tightly around a thick tree branch
about 20 feet off the ground.
   ``We have good people who are willing to pitch in and help their
neighbors,'' said Mrs. Boyd, who watched the tornado flip her front
porch onto and through the roof.
   ``I think you learn from a tragedy like this just how important
people are to you. You realize your life's in someone else's hands
other than your own.''

<HEAD>Freddy Kruger Nails on Lawyer's List of Worst Toys</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: For release 10 a.m. EST, time set by source</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Replicas of the blades-for-fingernails hands of
Freddy Krueger and a plastic ``Butcher Knife and Meat Cleaver''
today made a lawyer's annual list of hazardous toys.
   Also on the list by Edward Swartz, a personal injury lawyer,
were a crib toy that its own manufacturer had warned to ``keep out
of baby's reach,'' a doll and play clothes by Playskool and chewing
gum cigarettes.
   Swartz called the toys on his 18th annual list ``a time bomb
ready to explode.''
   A spokeswoman for a trade group representing 240 companies that
account for 90 percent of the domestic toy market downplayed the
criticism.
   ``He finds these toys that nobody's buying and nobody's playing
with,'' said Jodi Levin, of Toy Manufacturers of America.
   Swartz said the toys he listed were bought within the past six
weeks, but one company said its toy that made the list _ the X-15
Rocket Plane _ hasn't been manufactured for three years.
   ``We weren't selling enough of them,'' said Joe DiStefano, vice
president of Estes Industries. All of the company's remaining
rockets are used as ``a safe hobby and a safe science instrument,''
DiStefano said.
   Swartz cited two toys that replicate implements of destruction
in the popular horror movies ``A Nightmare of Elm Street'' and
``Friday the 13th.''
   He said the Freddy Krueger gloves, with plastic simulated knives
for fingernails, come in a package bearing a warning, in small
letters: ``Do not wave, poke or jab this glove at anybody's face,
eyes, ears or nose.''
   Swartz' list included addresses for some of the toys'
manufacturers, but not for the Freddy Krueger gloves' maker, Marty
Toy Inc.
   He also complained about an array of ``Friday the 13th'' replica
weapons. He singled out the ``Butcher Knife and Meat Cleaver'' set
by 1989 Rubie's Costume Co., for which he also listed no address.
   ``They are made out of rigid plastic, realistic in size and
appearance, and when used in play could cause eye or other physical
injury,'' Swartz said.
   Swartz said removable ribbons and elastic bands on the Kid
Sister doll by Playskool Inc., a subsidiary of Hasbro Inc., could
be swallowed by infants, and he said Playskool's Dressing Pretty
Bride play clothes are made with flammable lace ruffles and a
flammable veil.
   Wayne Charness, spokesman for Hasbro in Pawtucket, R.I., said
the federal government does not list ribbons and elastic bands as
small parts. And he said the bridal dress exceeds all federal and
state regulations on flammability.
   ``Our number one concern is the safety of children who use our
products. We go out of our way to ensure everything we produce is
safe,'' Charness said.
   Swartz also cited play gum cigarettes by Philadelphia Chewing
Gum Corp. in Havertown, Pa. Company officials failed to return a
telephone call requesting comment.
   Another toy that made the list was the Baby Mickey Musical Pull,
a cloth balloon with a string coming out of it. Pull the string and
the toy plays the song ``Over the Rainbow.''
   Swartz noted that the toy came with a disposable tag saying:
``Caution: To prevent possible entanglement, keep out of baby's
reach.'' Swartz also said stuffing inside the toy becomes exposed
with use and could be swallowed.
   Hal Kyle, corporate counsel for the toy's manufacturer, Applause
of Woodland Hills, Calif., maintained that the company's products
are safe.
   ``We make every effort to ensure every product complies with
certain mandated federal regulations,'' he said.
   But Kyle said Swartz's list has its benefits.
   ``Pretty much everyone in the industry at one point or another
has been put on that type of a list. We think it's healthy. It
makes the industry focus on product safety.''

<HEAD>Police Allow Protest, Soviets Reportedly Press for Reform</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia _ Authorities announced the lifting of
travel restrictions this week then began to show a hint of
tolerance for dissent: A street protest went off unperturbed and a
critic got a suspended sentence.
   About 1,000 people protested plans for a highway through
downtown Prague Wednesday with a march in the capital that police
did not move to break up.
   They did prevent protesters from marching to government
headquarters but their restraint was a departure from brutal
tactics of the past.
   Helmeted riot police have routinely beaten and arrested people
who stage demonstrations, most recently on Oct. 28 when
anti-government protesters in Prague sought to mark the anniversary
of the country's 1918 independence.
   On Wednesday, a court in Bratislava sentenced opposition
activist Miroslav Kusy to an eight-month suspended sentence and
acquitted three others. The activists had signed a statement urging
Slovaks to mark the 21st anniversary of the 1968 Soviet invasion
that crushed reforms.
   In the past, Kusy would almost certainly have been jailed.
   On Tuesday, Premier Ladislav Adamec announced that Czechoslovaks
wishing to travel to the West will no longer need exit visas
beginning Jan. 1.
   In today's editions, The New York Times quoted Communist Party
officials as saying the Soviet Union had warned Czechoslovakia last
week that further stalling on political reforms that have overtaken
other East bloc countries could cause serious trouble.
   The newspaper said Moscow had cautioned Prague in a high-level
message not to make the same mistakes as Communist hard-liners
elsewhere.
   The message cited East Germany, which opened its borders a week
ago under the pressure of a peaceful popular revolt that began the
October weekend that Mikhail S. Gorbachev visited to mark the 40th
anniversary of the Communist state and encouraged the country's
Communist leaders to get in step.
   A senior adviser to one Czech minister said the message was
similar to one sent to Bulgaria that apparently helped persuade
Todor I. Zhivkov that it was time to retire after 35 years in
power, according to the Times.
   In 1968, Soviet tanks and troops led a Warsaw Pact invasion that
ousted the Czechoslovakian government of Alexander Dubcek when it
tried to effect democratic reforms in what became known as the
``Prague Spring.''
   Now the Soviet Union is leading a wave of reform among East bloc
states. Poland and Hungary have followed Moscow's lead.
Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania have resisted, however.
   Up to 1,000 people took part in the rally Wednesday near
Prague's Old Town Square. They protested plans to build a
superhighway through the Stromovka Park, Prague's largest. So far
458 people have signed a petition seeking a referendum on the issue.
   The demonstrators divided into two groups, with one marching
toward the Romanian Embassy to protest that country's move a year
ago to crush a demonstration by workers in Brasov, Romania's
second-largest city.
   A larger group sought to cross Charles Bridge to reach buildings
housing the national government. Lines of police, many in riot
gear, blocked the other side of the bridge. There was no violence.
   Some of the protesters sat down, lighted candles and sang ``We
Shall Overcome.'' The crowd then rose to sing the national anthem.
   The riot police left a short time later. There were some shouts
from the crowd, including ``We want a new government'' and
``Germany, Germany,'' an apparent reference to the dramatic changes
in East Germany.
   The remaining police began to move and the crowd walked back
across the bridge, again singing the national anthem.
   More police moved in when the crowd surged toward the Old Town
Square, shouting ``Czechs, come with us.''
   ``You should protect us,'' they shouted at police. A small group
of demonstrators baited police and three were taken away.
   The demonstration was peaceful, although toward the end officers
pushed some of the protesters, who then gradually dispersed.
   A much larger demonstration was expected Friday to mark the 50th
anniversary of the first Czech uprising against the Nazi occupation.

<HEAD>Wine-Lovers Turn Out for Promising Beaujolais</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beaujolais nouveau fresh from the cask vied with
coffee and croissants in cafes this morning as bon vivants raced to
get their first taste of what forecasters hope will be the best
year for French wine in decades.
   ``Don't drink too much of that stuff or we won't see you for
lunch,'' a waiter joked with an early morning tippler at the Val
d'Or wine bar near the Champs Elysee. ``It's a lot more alcoholic
this year.''
   Proprietor Marcelle Rongier said the Val d'Or sold its first
bottle of the newly arrived Beaujolais nouveau to a regular
customer just after opening at 7 a.m.
   ``He's taking it to work,'' Mrs. Rongier said. ``And he said
he'd come back for lunch and then back again after he gets off.''
   A consumption embargo on the young wine, the first to be
consumed en masse since the autumn grape harvest, was lifted at
midnight Wednesday. Promoters called the 1989 stock the best in 25
years.
   ``This is an exceptional year for Beaujolais and all the
vintages in France,'' said Michel Deflache of the Beaujolais
winegrowers association. ``It's more of a complete wine this year.''
   Wine lovers await the arrival of the fruity beverage each
November at bars and parties from Paris to Australia. Planes,
trains, trucks and ships transported cases all over the world this
week so imbibers could enjoy their first glass today.
   The export success is largely due to Deflache's organization,
the Union Interprofessionnelle des Vins du Beaujolais. Critics and
admirers have debated the wine's other merits for years.
   ``It's extraordinary marketing, but not extraordinary wine,''
declared Jacques Constant, 49, who chose coffee instead of
Beaujolais for breakfast at the Bar St. Philippe in the fashionable
Faubourg St. Honore shopping district.
   ``Twenty years ago, this wine was nothing and it's still
nothing,'' Constant pronounced. ``The real French wines are the
Bordeaux and Bourgogne.''
   Bar owner Rene Bourel launched a spirited response: ``I prefer
the Beaujolais to the Bordeaux. Why? It's like a blond woman or a
brunette, a matter of taste. But I find Bordeaux disgusting.''
   Outdoor parties in the crisp November air were planned all over
the French capital this afternoon, with the largest expected to be
on the Ile de la Cite featuring a New Orleans jazz band and a
banquet of cheeses.
   Prognosticators look to this year's Beaujolais as a bellwether
for the much-hyped 1989 vintages.
   A long dry summer and early, rain-free harvest have led to
expectations that this year's French wines could rank among the
best this century, made of balanced grapes with minimal acidity.
   That gives the Beaujolais nouveau, normally considered an
inexpensive lightweight by connoisseurs, a greater role this year.
And wholesale price increases of 30 percent over last year point
the overall trend in the French wine market thanks to the vaunted
harvest, Deflache says.
   About half of this year's production of 4.4 million cases of
Beaujolais nouveau went to foreign markets, principally West
Germany, Britain, Belgium, the United States and Japan.
   The Japanese market remains the fastest-growing, Deflache said,
with demand jumping from 300,000 cases in 1988 to 440,000 cases
this year.
   The U.S. market represents an equivalent number of sales and
celebrations were planned today in New York, Los Angeles,
Pittsburgh, Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston and Dallas.

<HEAD>Pope: Church Supports AIDS Victims, but Lifestyles Must Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has pledged church support
for AIDS victims but says people at risk because of sexual
practices must not resort to ``morally illicit'' means of
prevention, an apparent reference to condoms.
   ``The church ... is concerned not only with stating a series of
`no's' to particular behavior patterns, but above all with
proposing a completely meaningful lifestyle for the person,'' he
said Wednesday in the closing address of a three-day Vatican
conference on AIDS.
   The pope's speech constituted his most extensive comments to
date on what he called ``the impending plague of AIDS.''
   John Paul spoke hours after an American doctor said about 1,500
U.S. military personnel contract the AIDS virus every year and that
the disease will become the leading cause of death in the U.S.
armed forces.
   ``It is morally illicit to support as AIDS prevention any method
which violates the authentically human sense of sexuality,'' the
pope said, speaking in Italian before the assembly of more than
1,000 scientists, theologians, church officials and health-care
workers.
   While he did not mention condoms, church officials said it was
clear he was ruling out their use as a means of curbing the spread
of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. That position was expressed
repeatedly by speakers during the conference.
   The church opposes all forms of artificial birth control.
   In another apparent reference to condoms, the pope condemned
AIDS prevention based on ``egoistic interests deriving from
considerations that are incompatible with the fundamental values of
life and love.''
   John Paul has in the past expressed his solidarity with those
suffering from the deadly disease, but the pontiff for the first
time Wednesday addressed the causes of AIDS and related sexual
issues.
   Some church and Vatican officials at the conference specifically
condemned sexual activity among homosexuals, but the pope spoke in
more general terms.
   He noted that AIDS can often be attributed to the ``phenomena of
drug addiction and the abuse of sexuality.''
   ``The necessary prevention against the AIDS threat is not to be
found in fear, but rather in the conscious choice of a healthy,
free and responsible lifestyle,'' he said.
   Lt. Col. Robert Redfield, chief of AIDS research at the Walter
Reed Army Institute of Research, said between 200 and 500 U.S.
military personnel have died from the disease in the past six years
and more than 5,000 have the virus.
   Redfield said 1,500 people in the three branches of the U.S.
armed forces contract the HIV virus annually.
   Assuming that most of those with the virus will die in eight to
12 years, AIDS can be considered ``the single leading cause of
mortality in the military, surpassing automobile accidents, and any
other medical illness combined,'' Reed said. About 700 military
personnel die each year in car accidents, he said.
   In the Army, he said, one of every 500 men and one of every
1,000 women has the AIDS virus.
   He did not say how the sufferers had contracted the AIDS virus,
which is most commonly transmitted through intimate sexual contact,
intravenous needles and the exchange of blood. More than 40 percent
of the infected Army personnel are married, Redfield said.
   The dissent that emerged Tuesday about the tone and structure of
the AIDS conference flared again Wednesday.
   In a stormy meeting, conference chairman Archbishop Fiorenzo
Angelinia told about 50 delegates why he had refused a request to
allow Peter Larkin, an AIDS sufferer from London, to address the
conference.
   Angelini said there was no time to add Larkin to the program,
that the request was made in a provocative way and that the
conference was ``for AIDS sufferers, not of them.''
   Larkin, 34, stormed out of the room, saying, ``This man is a
disgrace to his cloth.''
   He later returned and apologized, and Angelini invited him to
greet the pope personally later Wednesday.
   Angelini also agreed to publish the dissident group's views in a
church magazine report on the conference.

   Ruby the elephant can paint, but can she
differentiate between colors?
   The Phoenix Zoo, with help from researchers at several
universities, have started testing Ruby to find out.
   The 16-year-old pachyderm received her first paintbrush two
years ago when her keepers noticed she spent a lot of time using
rocks and sticks to doodle in the sand. Before long, painting had
become a favored reward for successfully completing her regular
obedience training.
   ``All we have to do is say the word `paint,' and she squeals,''
said keeper Tawny Carlson.
   Zoo officials noticed Ruby seems to choose the color of her
paint based on colors worn by her visitors. On days guests wear
red, the officials said, she tends to paint red; yellow came into
vogue when large earthmoving equipment worked on a nearby
construction project.
   ``Color vision has only been documented in primates. If we can
document this, it will be something new for elephants,'' said zoo
keeper Anita Schanberger.
   ``It's not a trivial question to answer,'' said Chris Murphy, a
veterinary ophthalmologist with the medical school at the
University of California, Davis. ``It sounds trivial, but you can't
just hold out red and blue plastic blocks and then say that proves
it.''
   Murphy and colleagues at California-Davis, along with experts at
Cornell University, Arizona State University and the University of
Arizona, have coached zoo personnel on how to conduct the color
testing, zoo spokesman Dick George said Wednesday.
   Zookeepers have developed a plywood testing device that will
eventually be used to test for color discrimination, but first Ruby
must master the mechanics of the machine, which involves pulling a
lever for a food reward. George said the testing could take several
years.

   Reno's most prominent painted lady, an 18-foot
showgirl statue, has been ordered down from her perch after
welcoming visitors with open arms and a champagne toast since the
1950s.
   Depicted for years on postcards of the gambling city's downtown,
the scantily clad Primadonna Lady is the only survivor among nine
long-legged statue showgirls that for three decades towered above
the old Primadonna hotel-casino.
   In 1984, the Primadonna Lady _ paint chipping on her red
strapless costume, her tired eyes and her hairdo below her
feathered hat _ was moved from downtown to the roof of a proposed
burlesque dance club.
   But the club never opened. And now city officials want the
statue removed. They cite city ordinances barring closed businesses
from retaining signs advertising the enterprise.
   Mike Mitchell, a supervisor in the city's building department,
said Wednesday he was responding to a complaint in ordering the
building's owners to take the statue down within 10 days.
   ``I guess this is a personal thing for a lot of people,''
Mitchell said. ``She's been around a long time. I do have empathy
for her. But that doesn't have any bearing on why she has to come
down.''
   Mark De La Fuente, a member of the board of Would Corp., which
owns the would-be burlesque and an adult bookstore next door, said
city officials are harassing his company.
   ``It's funny in a state like this, but they don't seem to like
our kind of business much,'' he said. Licensed brothels are legal
in most Nevada counties.

<HEAD>`Death' of Berlin Wall Celebrated at Site of `Iron Curtain' Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT CHARTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>FULTON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worshippers celebrated the ``death'' of the
Berlin Wall during services at Westminster College, where Winston
Churchill gave his famous warning of an Iron Curtain descending
across Europe more than four decades ago.
   ``If Sir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill were among us this
day, he would be smiling,'' said the Rev. William Young, chaplain
at the college, ``because this is the dawn of a new era, one which
he longed to see and which his wise leadership helped to create.''
   Wednesday evening's service was promoted as a worship of thanks
for new freedom in East Germany, where easing of travel
restrictions in the last week allowed thousands to go West for the
first time since 1961.
   ``We are here to celebrate the death of an inanimate object _ a
wall _ yet that wall has come to symbolize all that has kept us
apart,'' said Jack Rogers, executive director of Ecumenical
Ministries of Callaway County.
   In a March 5, 1946, lecture at Westminster, Churchill _ out of
government but introduced as an honored visitor by President Truman
_ chillingly predicted the separation of Europe.
   ``From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron
curtain has descended across the Continent,'' Churchill said.
``Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of
Central and Eastern Europe.''
   Churchill, who died in 1965, never claimed authorship of the
phrase, which he had used before in writing. But the speech was
indelibly etched in history books.
   Young noted that Churchill also urged in his speech that England
and the United States work together in building a ``Temple of
Peace.''
   ``In an age known as the Cold War, peace has seemed precarious;
the Iron Curtain has remained firm,'' Young said.
   ``However, in just the past few years, the past few months, the
past few weeks, even in the past few days, the winds of change have
been blowing so strongly across the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe
that his dream now seems not only possible but likely. The Iron
Curtain is being lifted. Dare we hope that a firm foundation for
Sir Winston's `Temple of Peace' has finally been laid?''
   The service was filmed by the British Broadcasting Corp. for a
documentary about Churchill that will air in the United States in
1991, said executive producer Jeremy Bennett.

   Starr said he and other musicians were drunk or on dope for much
of the recording session and that release of the album would have
harmed his musical reputation.
   Starr wore a black suit with turned-up collar, dark glasses, one
dangling earring and two rings on each hand to his court date
Wednesday. He testified for about an hour before leaving with his
wife Barbara Bach, without greeting fans waiting outside.
   Starr's appearance in Fulton County Superior Court drew a steady
stream of courthouse employees into the trial room.
   The former Beatle drummer sued Memphis, Tenn., record producer
Chips Moman to block the 1987 recordings, on which Moman claims he
spent $146,000 to produce.
   Moman, whose College Park, Ga.-based record company also is
named in the lawsuit, claims to have a financial stake in Starr's
next two albums, and the trial's consideration of financial matters
was expected to continue through Friday.
   Judge Clarence Cooper granted a permanent injunction to block
the album before testimony even began Wednesday.
   Starr testified that he entered the Memphis recording session
thinking he and Moman did not have a formal agreement. He said any
money or deals for further recording were contingent on whether the
1987 album was completed and released and on whether it was a hit.
   ``If the album we were making was a hit, then Chips did not want
to be left in the cold when I made the next one,'' Starr added. ``I
understood that.''
   But Moman testified that he and Starr agreed to an exclusive
three-album deal.
   Starr said he drank heavily during the sessions and only sang,
never playing the drums.
   Three musicians who worked on the sessions, however, testified
that they never witnessed any alcohol consumed during the
recording. Drummer Gene Chrisman said Starr declined invitations to
play the drums on some songs.
   Moman's attorneys have said Starr came to the producer in an
attempt to revive his waning music career. Though acknowledging he
had not had a hit record in several years, Starr testified he was
not desperate when he first talked with Moman.
   ``It was just a move for your career,'' he said. ``I wasn't
looking for Chips, and Chips probably wasn't looking for me.''
   Moman said Bob Dylan made a guest vocal appearance on one song
on the never-released album, which includes cover versions of the
songs ``I Can Help'' and ``Ain't That a Shame.''

   A blast of frigid air continued to move through the nation's
midsection today, as thunderstorms were pushing out the warm
weather that the East has had since the weekend.
   Tornadoes in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and
Kentucky caused hundreds of injuries and many deaths Wednesday.
   Wintery weather swept into Michigan, bringing snow that put a
chill on the opening day of deer season and was a factor in an auto
accident in which four teen-agers were killed.
   Temperatures early this morning fell to freezing in Chicago and
Peoria, 30 in Rockford and 33 in Decatur as a light snow dusted
central Illinois.
   On Wednesday, temperatures dipped into the teens and single
digits from eastern Montana through the Dakotas to northwestern
Minnesota by early evening. Winds gusting to 40 mph produced wind
chill readings colder than 25 degrees below zero.
   There were dozens of reports of large hail and damaging winds in
Kentucky, Alabama and Mississippi on Wednesday, while thunderstorms
produced heavy rain across parts of the Ohio Valley, Tennessee and
the central Gulf Coast states.
   In Ohio, thunderstorms produced an inch of rain in half an hour
in Fairfield, 1.75 inches of rain in 20 minutes at Wayne, and 1.7
inches of rain in 20 minutes at Trenton.
   Snow fell across the upper Mississippi Valley and western
sections of the Great Lakes region Wednesday night, with heavy snow
today along the southern shore of Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.
   Up to a foot of snow was expected to fall today in upper
Michigan and storm warnings and watches were in effect for lower
Michigan and northern Indiana. Gale warnings were in effect for
Lake Superior and Lake Michigan.
   The nation's high Wednesday was 92 degrees at McAllen, Texas.

<TEXT>
   The National Council of Churches is making a
push to strengthen ties with Roman Catholics and conservative
evangelicals, traditionally on the sidelines of America's largest
ecumenical body.
   It is one of the more pressing matters facing the council in the
1990s, according to members of the council's governing board, who
are gathered in Pittsburgh this week for their twice-yearly meeting.
   ``If the wall can come down in Germany, anything can happen. But
my assumption would be that we would form a new council'' if Roman
Catholics and evangelicals assumed a more active role, said the
Rev. Patricia McClurg, outgoing council president.
   ``The Roman Catholic Church in membership is larger than all the
rest of us here put together,'' she said. ``And so in fairness to
the way they would approach such a council, the gifts they would
bring, I believe we would have to draw a new blueprint.''
   Ms. McClurg, associate executive of the Presbytery mission in
Elizabeth, N.J., told the governing board Wednesday a committee has
been appointed to increase council input from Roman Catholics and
evangelicals. Although the two groups currently are represented on
some council projects, neither is a full-fledged member.
   The Rev. Eileen W. Lindner, a Presbyterian minister from
Tenafly, N.J., and an associate general secretary for the council,
said the seven-member committee will ``explore the ways in which
we're already witnessing Christian unity'' with Roman Catholics and
evangelicals.
   Thirty-two Protestant, Orthodox and Anglican denominations
constitute the council, with a combined membership of 42 million
Christians.
   Some conservative evangelicals have criticized the council in
the past for its involvement in so many social issues, according to
the Very Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, an archpriest of the Orthodox
Church in America who will be installed tonight as the council's
new president.
   ``Some evangelical people would feel that more prayer is
needed,'' Kishkovsky said.
   Many of the resolutions being considered by the 273-member
governing board during its three-day meeting in Pittsburgh, which
ends Friday, involve domestic issues. One measure calls for a
congressional hearing to discuss the harassment of black elected
officials, while another urges legislation banning the sale of
handguns and assault weapons to the public.
   Other resolutions being voted on by the board today call for
continued support of affirmative action and equal pay for work of
equal value.
   On international issues, the council's division of overseas
ministries is urging the U.S. government to prevent the return to
power in Cambodia of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge. The governing board
also will consider resolutions involving the political situations
in El Salvador and Angola, and the 75th anniversary of the Armenian
genocide.
   Kishkovsky and the Rev. Syngman Rhee, the president-elect
nominee, said they want to focus more on matters closer to home
during the next few years in hopes of helping the faithful through
today's trying times.
   ``The churches need to take concern and care for what is
happening in the United States'' like divorce and drug abuse, said
Rhee, a mission executive with the Presbyterian Church (USA) in
Louisville, Ky.
   ``Global issues have occupied our attention and our energy quite
a bit. We need to come back to the basic patterns of ministries of
the church to the people,'' he said.
   Council leaders hope the shift will have a financial effect as
well. The council is in the midst of a restructuring prompted, in
part, by stagnant contributions from the 32 denominations.
   Council officials on Wednesday presented a proposed budget of
$45.4 million for 1990, nearly $1 million more than 1989's spending
plan. About 70 percent of the money will go to Church World
Service, the council's relief and refugee resettlement agency.

   An 82-year-old woman came out swinging when
a firefighter tried to rescue her from her burning home,
authorities said
   The volunteer firefighter who found Evelyn Foreman of Bedford on
the floor of her smoke-filled bedroom Tuesday said he expected to
find her unconscious or dead.
   Instead, she started throwing punches, said the 28-year-old
firefighter, Daniel Datesman.
   Mrs. Foreman remained hospitalized in stable condition early
today.
   ``She wanted to know who the hell I was and what I was doing in
her bedroom,'' Datesman said Wednesday. ``She wouldn't leave her
home.''
   Mrs. Foreman slugged her rescuer three times before collapsing.
Datesman said he didn't understand how she was able to do that in
heavy smoke.
   Other volunteers helped Datesman carry Mrs. Foreman out of the
house when he became disoriented in the smoke.
   ``She beat the heck out of him,'' Assistant Fire Chief Steve
Wineland said. ``She was definitely feisty.''
   The cause of the fire, which caused $15,000 in damages, has not
been determined, Wineland said.
   The flames were confined to the kitchen. The rest of the
2{-story brick home received water and smoke damage.
   Mrs. Foreman, a retired nurse, came to once firefighters got her
outside and initially refused to go to Memorial Hospital of Bedford
County. Neighbors and friends finally persuaded her to go as a
precaution.
   Datesman said he planned to visit Mrs. Foreman ``to give her a
big bouquet of flowers and a big hug. She's a remarkable woman.''

   After a rocky fund-raising effort, backers say
they have the money to break ground next year for a national rock
'n' roll hall of fame and museum in downtown Cleveland.
   ``We are off the rocks and on a roll,'' Cleveland Mayor George
Voinovich said at a news conference announcing the city had met the
Wednesday deadline to raise $40 million for the glass-and-steel
pyramid structure with 18-story tower.
   The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation in New York, a group
of recording industry executives and artists' promoters and
managers which each year since 1986 has inducted music figures into
the hall, had set the deadline.
   The rock mecca is expected to cost $48 million overall. The city
still must find the other $8 million; no deadline for that amount
has been announced.
   The hall would be a centerpiece for a new hotel-retail complex,
called Tower City, which is under construction.
   Larry Thompson, the hall's director, said $40.2 million was
raised by Tuesday night. Contributions and pledges came from
corporations, foundations, government and others.
   Of the $40 million, $5 million comes from a state appropriation,
$5 million from county bonds and $18 million from city property
taxes on Tower City that would be used toward the rock hall's
construction.
   The rest came in commitments by Cleveland corporations and
foundations as well as in personal gifts, said Thompson.
   Last month, a $6.9 million federal Urban Development Action
Grant, considered a key piece in the project's funding, fell
through.
   Local promoters predicted about 600,000 people would visit the
hall and museum each year and spend about $85 million at area
hotels, restaurants and shops.
   Cleveland, where disc jockey Alan Freed is said to have coined
the term ``rock 'n' roll,'' and seven other cities vied to be home
of the hall.

   Researchers said today they have found evidence
of mysterious ozone destruction near Antarctica that cannot be
explained by the well-known ``ozone hole'' there.
   The finding suggests that scientists have more to learn about
the important problem of what destroys ozone in the atmosphere,
said researcher M.H. Proffitt.
   Reporting in the British journal Nature, the scientists said
they had detected ozone losses outside the ozone hole, which is an
area of annual and temporary ozone destruction over Antarctica.
They also found evidence that ozone losses begin before the hole
forms each year.
   Other scientists urged caution in interpreting the research but
said it is potentially significant.
   Ozone is a form of oxygen. It is a pollutant at ground level but
beneficial high in the atmosphere, where it shields out ultraviolet
rays that can promote skin cancer.
   Protection of the globe's ozone shield has become a focus of
international concern, focusing on the use of compounds called
chlorofluorocarbons. Chlorine from those compounds is implicated in
the ozone hole.
   The new study's co-authors include Proffitt of the Cooperative
Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, a joint venture
of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the
University of Colorado. The other co-authors are with NOAA.
   The scientists found evidence of ozone destruction at altitudes
of about 11 miles to 12 miles by analyzing readings taken during
airplane flights during 1987.
   In an unusual approach to measuring ozone losses, the
researchers first determined an apparently normal minimum ratio of
ozone levels to amounts of nitrogen compounds. When a given sample
of air showed a lower ratio, it was considered to have lost some
ozone.
   Using this method, the researchers found evidence of ozone loss
averaging at least 15 percent to 30 percent at the 11-mile altitude
outside the ozone hole, the limits of which roughly correspond to
the outline of Antarctica.
   The newly found area of depletion extended about 342 miles
outside the boundary of the ozone hole and perhaps twice that far,
Proffitt said in a telephone interview.
   In addition, losses inside and outside the area covered by the
ozone hole were observed in mid-August, which was before the
formation of the hole in September.
   The researchers concluded that losses outside the ozone hole
were caused by some sort of chemical reaction that occurred outside
the hole. Perhaps they resulted from temporary conditions that
allowed chlorine to destroy ozone for limited periods, Proffitt
said.
   Robert de Zafra of the State University of New York at Stony
Brook, who has studied the chemistry of the ozone hole, said
Wednesday he found the paper's evidence ``interesting but not
compelling.''
   He cautioned that the researchers used only an indirect means of
detecting ozone loss. An aberration similar to what they called
evidence of ozone loss near the ozone hole also appears in their
data from the Northern Hemisphere, but they do not claim ozone loss
there, he said.
   Still, if their analysis near the ozone hole ``holds up and is
verified by other, more direct measurements, then this is a fairly
major and significant finding that will send people scurrying to
try to determine the cause of it,'' he said.
   Guy Brasseur, acting director of the atmospheric chemistry
division at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, Colo., also cautioned the paper's conclusions should be
considered only tentative.
   The paper gives good evidence for ozone destruction, but not
absolute proof, he said.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was generally higher in lively late
morning trading in Europe today, buoyed by investor demand ahead of
the release of eagerly awaited U.S. trade figures.
   Gold prices fell below the important $390.00 an ounce level in
quiet trading.
   The market was expecting the U.S. trade deficit to have narrowed
to around $8.9 billion in September, from $10.77 billion in August,
dealers said.
   Traders said it will take a trade deficit of between $8.3
billion and $8.5 billion for the dollar to be pushed up. A deficit
wider than $9 billion will send the dollar lower, they said.
   ``Recent economic indicators have shown the U.S. economy is
slowing, but the underlying, long-term prospects for the U.S.
economy are still good,'' said one trader in Milan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 0.48 yen to a closing 143.85 yen. Later, in
London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 144.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.84355 West German marks, up from 1.8382
   _1.6320 Swiss francs, up from 1.6220
   _6.2710 French francs, up from 6.2420
   _2.07835 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0790
   _1,354.50 Italian lire, up from 1,348.25
   _1.1712 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1726
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5755 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5810 late Wednesday.
   An overnight rise in gold prices was wiped out by European
selling pressure this morning. Dealers said they expect profit
taking and consolidation in light of gold's recent upward climb.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $390.30 a troy ounce,
down from late Wednesday's $391.25. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of $389.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $388.75, down from $391.00 late
Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.32 to close at a bid $389.62.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.49 a troy
ounce, up from Wednesday's $5.46.

<TEXT>
   A lesbian couple who adopted a boy with
AIDS charged that California and other states were wasting
taxpayers' money and ignoring the welfare of children by forbidding
adoptions by unmarried people.
   The couple, Millie Jessen and Sue Pavlik, held a news conference
at the National Center for Lesbian Rights on Wednesday with their
2-year-old son Eric to comment on the lengthy battle required to
legalize his adoption.
   An judge in June allowed the adoption to proceed, and it became
final in July.
   But attorney Roberta Achtenberg said there were many cases in
the country in which couples qualified to care for orphans were not
permitted to do so.
   The lesbian rights center has represented about a half dozen
unmarried couples across the country who have won adoption battles,
she said. ``The issue is not a gay or straight one.''
   ``Millie and Sue's marital status does not determine their
parenting abilities,'' Achtenberg said.
   Achtenberg said courts should look at children's welfare
foremost, rather than adhering to guidelines of the state Social
Services Department, which is oriented to promote traditional
marriage, she said.
   During the news conference, Eric sat on Pavlik's lap playing
with Batman figures part of the time, sometimes getting up to
toddle around the office chasing a golf ball, while mugging for
cameras and calling out ``Mommy! Mommy!''
   Jessen said: ``I'm `Mommy.' She's (Pavlik) `Mama,' and it's
really cute when he says, `Mommy, Mama,' when he wants both of us.''
   Jessen and Pavlik said they were welcomed when they offered
their home for foster care of children testing positive for the HIV
virus, which causes AIDS. They took Eric home from the hospital
when he was just 5 weeks old, but met with resistance several
months later when they asked to adopt the boy.
   Although social service officials recognized that Jessen and
Pavlik offered Eric a stable and nuturing home, ``nobody wanted to
be the bad guy in this case ... so they sat on it,'' Achtenberg
said.
   It took nine months for the necessary documents and reports to
be filed with the court _ a matter that could have been decided in
6 weeks, Achtenberg said.
   Achtenberg said she believes the case will make it easier for
other judges to rule in favor of unmarried couples seeking adoption
_ and may step up political pressure to change the policy against
adoption by the unmarried.
   Jessen and Pavlik said they were ecstatic about winning legal
recognition as Eric's adoptive parents. Although they feel strong
parental bonds to the boy, Jessen said, as partners for the past
five years it was important to have the relationship validated
officially rather to be treated as ``second-class citizens.''
   The court ruled Jessen and Pavlik to be Eric's adoptive parents,
with both guaranteeing his care and support. Eric's mother is dead;
his natural father gave the women his blessing, saying he would be
unable to provide the special medical care the boy will need
because of AIDS, Achtenberg said.
   Jessen, a computer programmer, and Pavlik, a homemaker, said
they became interested in becoming foster parents for children with
AIDS after taking a course in helping people with the deadly
disease.
   Both women describe Eric as a healthy and normal right now,
although he was born 8 to 10 weeks premature and didn't catch up
developmentally until he turned two. Last January, he suffered a
bacterial blood infection related to AIDS, they said.
   The boy takes AZT and participates in a study on the benefits of
gamma globulin in treating AIDS.
   ``He has AIDS, but right now he's doing very well,'' Pavlik said.

<HEAD>`A Few Good Men,' A New Play by Aaron Sorkin, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS four grafs with critics' reviews. No PMs planned.</HEAD>

   Don't tell it to the Marines.
   There's a lot of plot, maybe too much, in ``A Few Good Men,'' an
overstuffed and not entirely convincing military courtroom drama
that opened Wednesday at Broadway's Music Box Theatre.
   Playwright Aaron Sorkin has packed more than 60 scenes and 20
actors into his nearly three-hour examination of what happened to a
young Marine at the United States Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.
   Some of the evening is entertaining, thanks to the author's
snappy, often funny dialogue. The jokes help camouflage the play's
dramatic shortcomings, particularly its meager attempts to flesh
out the personal life of the main character and a confusing,
disappointing courtroom finale. But the laughs also get in the way
and finally trivialize the serious story Sorkin is trying to tell.
   The play marks the Broadway debut of the 28-year-old Sorkin and
of director Don Scardino, who has made a name for himself as an
actor and as a director of television's ``The Days and Nights of
Molly Dodd.''
   Its hero is a wisecracking Navy lawyer named Daniel Kaffee,
played with a great deal of charm and humor by Tom Hulce. Kaffee is
assigned to defend two Marines charged with murdering a third
soldier. The dead Marine, Pfc. William Santiago, was disliked for
being a malingerer, trying to get out of the Corps and writing
letters of complaint to his senator.
   Santiago was the victim of a ``Code Red,'' a Marine term for a
brutal form of hazing. The two men on trial for his death are
willing to take the punishment for what happened. But Kaffee, with
the help of two other defense lawyers, played by Megan Gallagher
and Mark Nelson, are determined to prove a coverup.
   They run up against the abrasive, super-macho Guantanamo Marine
commander, Lt. Col. Nathan Jessep, played by a grinning Stephen
Lang. Lang gives a maniacal, over-the-top performance that gets
more cartoonish as the evening goes on.
   Hulce gets uneven support from the other cast members. A
sad-faced Mark Nelson brings intelligence and a sly sense of fun to
the role of Hulce's nebbish assistant, while a bland Gallagher has
the impossible task of playing his other, more gung-ho partner.
Both of the roles only pad the plot.
   Much better is a low-keyed Clark Gregg as Hulce's formidable
opponent, and Victor Love and Michael Dolan are ramrod perfection
as the two accused Marines. Several other cameos fall flat,
particularly Ted Marcoux as a Bible-thumping officer and Geoffrey
Nauffts as a hayseed Marine who takes the witness stand.
   Scardino hasn't just directed the play, he has choreographed it.
Scenes blend quickly into each other on designer Ben Edwards'
simple two-tiered platform set with a ghostly sentry tower standing
guard over the back of the stage. It's a fine job.
   But someone should have sent Sorkin back to cut the play. The
wait for the minimal dramatic payoff is long, and even when it
comes, several issues _ particularly the death of Santiago _ remain
unresolved.
   ``A Few Good Men'' already has been sold to the movies, and Tom
Cruise is reportedly interested in the script. Maybe by the time it
begins filming, Sorkin will have streamlined the play. But what's
on stage now at the Music Box looks and sounds like a long night of
one playwright's basic training.
   Howard Kissel wrote in today's editions of the Daily News that
Sorkin skillfully built his story with strong confrontations and
sharp banter. But Kissel wondered, ``What is this really about?''
   The New York Times' Frank Rich said the play was too predictable
and attempts to tie it to larger moral issues were lightweight.
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post applauded Sorkin for writing
an ``old-fashioned, strickly commercial melodrama'' that ``provides
an evening of sheer delight, unadultered by the need for serious
thought, uncomplicated by consideration of higher dramatic
sensibility.''
   Noting trial plays are clearly set up and conclude neatly, Linda
Winer of New York Newsday said people who like courtroom dramas
will be thrilled with ``Good Men.'' But she called for ``something
more substantial to hang on to than a mechanical genre with its
bolts showing.''

<HEAD>Judge Was Undressed, Former Secretary Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EBENSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former court secretary says she felt
insulted after she saw a judge wearing nothing but his undershorts
when he called her into in his office six years ago.
   Betty Krisko, 58, told a jury Wednesday she yelled an epithet at
suspended Judge Joseph F. O'Kicki before stalking out of his office
that day.
   O'Kicki, 59, who sat on the bench for 17 years before being
suspended last year, is on trial on 11 charges spanning more than a
decade. He has denied the charges, which include bribery,
extortion, open lewdness and coercion.
   ``He was standing sideways, 10 to 12 feet away, dictating into
the Dictaphone,'' Betty Krisko said, testifying on the April 1983
episode. ``He had nothing on but a pair of bikini briefs,'' she
said.
   ``I was disgusted and embarrassed.''
   O'Kicki appeared to be naked when he called the former secretary
into his office on another occasion in July 1983, said Ms. Krisco,
who worked for the judge for 12 years before leaving in February
1985.
   Under cross-examination by defense attorney Richard Galloway,
Ms. Krisko said she could see only O'Kicki's chest area and could
not tell whether he was wearing pants.
   She also testified that although her relationship with the judge
was good at one point, in later years O'Kicki often harassed her
and appeared to be trying to ``get rid'' of her.
   ``He gave me so many problems at work,'' she said. ``He ...
locked me out of the office and ... threw files off my desk.''
   Earlier Wednesday, defense attorneys questioned the credibility
of a former tipstaff who said he often drove O'Kicki's daughters to
college or performed chores around the judge's house on county time.
   George Koban, a former Philadelphia police officer who left the
force in 1972 because of a disability, said he paid O'Kicki $500
for a better-paying job but never received it.
   A tipstaff takes care of the jury and keeps the courtroom in
order.
   Defense attorneys Wednesday presented Koban's bank records from
that time, saying they did not reflect a $500 withdrawal.
   O'Kicki's trial began Nov. 7 and is expected to last at least
three weeks. He faces a second trial on 16 other counts at a still
unscheduled date.

   William N. Deramus III, chairman of
Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., died Wednesday at age 73. A
cause of death was not released.
   Deramus began his railroad career in 1939 on the Wabash Railroad
after receiving a law degree from Harvard University. In 1949, he
became the youngest railroad chief when he was named president of
the old Chicago, Great Western Railway.
   In 1961, Deramus was elected president of the Kansas City
Southern Railway Co. and its subsidiary, Louisiana &amp; Arkansas
Railway Co. Deramus succeeded his father.
   He established Kansas City Southern Industries as a holding
company in the early 1960s. It was one of the first of its kind in
the railroad industry, and it expanded into life insurance, real
estate, broadcasting and data processing.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   The state transport company
today fired hundreds of striking black workers, and police
headquarters said six officers were hurt in two clashes with
club-wielding strikers.
   Strikes against South African Transport Services are illegal
because its rail, trucking and harbor operations are designated as
essential.
   The company fired 626 workers earlier this week and said more
than 800 others were being fired today.
   Police headquarters said violence broke out at a railway station
in Germiston, near Johannesburg, when about 50 strikers arrived by
train for a union meeting without having paid their rail fares.
   Officers moved in to arrest the men and were attacked with
sticks, whips and stones, police said. Strikers scattered after
officers fired two pistol shots, according to police, who said
three officers were injured.
   An hour later, three more officers were hurt trying to disperse
about 150 strikers outside a union office in Germiston, according
to police headquarters. No arrests were reported in either incident.
   The dispute centers on a demand by the South African Railwyas
and Harbor Workers for the minimum wage to be increased to $570 a
month from $230. Other issues in dispute are the union's objection
to possible privatization and the company's refusal to officially
recognize the union.
   Most of the strikers are in the Johannesburg-Pretoria area and
the port city of Durban.
   The union, which says 40,000 workers are striking, is affiliated
to the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the country's
largest and most militantly anti-apartheid labor federation.
   The union claims a membership of 40,000 of the total 180,000
black workers employed by the transport company.
   The transport strike is one of two bitter, nationwide labor
disputes that show no signs of resolution.
   About 6,000 black employees of South African Breweries, the
country's privately owned beer monopoly, have been on strike for
five weeks.
   On Wednesday, the brewery workers' union lowered its wage demand
for the first time, saying it would accept a 32 percent increase
instead of a 38 percent increase. But management maintained its
refusal to change its ``final'' offer of a 16 percent raise.
   Seven deaths have been linked to the strike.
   Police officials also said today that 15 black activists had
been arrested for participating in an illegal meeting in Alexandra,
a township adjoining Johannesburg. The meeting followed the
announcement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission for
a protest march in Alexandra on Saturday.
   Organizers hoped 30,000 would join the march to demand new
housing, an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accrued
during a three-year rent boycott.

<HEAD>IBM Says Used Equipment Sold to Government as New</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp. has
acknowledged that it sold the federal government used equipment it
had claimed was new, a published report said today.
   IBM spokesman Mark Holcomb told The Washington Times that the
company also falsely certified that equipment sold to the
government was made of domestic parts in accordance with the Buy
American Act.
   Holcomb said IBM has been trying to negotiate a settlement with
the General Services Administration, the government agency that has
been investigating IBM computer contracts.
   ``Eighteen months ago, IBM discovered through its own internal
audit procedure and disclosed to the government contract compliance
related to the Buy American Act and the new-versus-used issue,''
Holcomb told the newspaper.
   He said the false certifications may have begun as early as 1982
but that the GSA was investigating IBM shipments from 1986 to 1988.
   A finding that IBM gave false information could lead the federal
government to suspend one of its biggest computer contractors from
doing business with the government.
   IBM provides computer mainframes and support services to the
federal government. The GSA told the Times that IBM received 84
percent of Navy contracts for IBM or IBM-compatible mainframes.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Dan Eramian, declined to say
whether the department is investigating IBM, the Times said.
   Holcomb said IBM has acted to correct the problems and said the
false certifications were not made intentionally.
   ``It's a matter of not knowing as the result of an
administration problem, not knowing the content. IBM has corrected
the problem. It no longer exists,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lawyer Urges More Disclosure of Medical Conflict of Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors shouldn't send patients to a clinic for
expensive tests if they own a stake in the clinic _ unless they
advise the patient to get a second opinion first, a law professor
argues in a medical journal article.
   The attorney, Marc A. Rodwin of Tufts University, said it is not
enough for doctors simply to tell patients about the conflict of
interest, because patients may not understand why it matters.
   Many doctors now own shares in X-ray centers and other
facilities where they frequently send patients for tests or other
services.
   ``Patients need to know that virtually every major study
indicates that physicians who make referrals to medical facilities
they own recommend more (or more expensive) medical tests and
procedures than physicians without ownership interests,'' Rodwin
wrote.
   Rodwin outlined his case in a report published today in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   Conflict of interest can affect a doctor's views about whether a
medical service is needed _ not just who should provide it, Rodwin
said.
   Rather than simply telling patients about their conflict or
giving them a list of alternative clinics, ``physicians who
recommend expensive tests or procedures in facilities in which they
have a financial interest should probably advise their patients to
seek a second opinion from a physician without a conflict of
interest.''

   An ``NBC Nightly News'' show using three anchors
instead of Tom Brokaw alone was brought on by special circumstances
and does not signal a change in the program's format, the network
said.
   Brokaw taped the start of the Wednesday night show in
Washington, D.C., then had to leave to serve as master of
ceremonies at the annual Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights awards,
said NBC spokeswoman Katherine McQuay.
   Mary Alice Williams, in New York, filled in during the rest of
the broadcast, with Garrick Utley, in Berlin, anchoring reports
about developments in Eastern Europe.
   ABC was the first network to use a triple-anchor format on a
regular evening newscast. From 1978 to 1983, its newscast was
anchored in Washington by Frank Reynolds, in Chicago by Max
Robinson, and in London by Peter Jennings. Jennings has been sole
anchor of ``World News Tonight'' since ABC's troika format was
dropped six years ago. Reynolds and Robinson have since died.

<TEXT>
   Trying to keep pace with the changes sweeping
Europe, the Italian Communist Party has taken a revolutionary step
of its own.
   After months of debate, party leader Achille Occhetto has put
the machinery in motion to drop the word ``Communist'' from the
party name, eliminate the hammer and sickle from its symbol and
present the skeleton as a new force grouping leftist parties.
   Occhetto is hoping the change will reverse the party's sagging
political fortunes and end the stigma that has kept it out of the
national government for 42 years.
   It is a gamble that could change the political map in a country
where one party, the Christian Democrats, has led or dominated all
governments since the end of World War II.
   ``Divisions among leftists have caused the permanent victory of
the Christian Democrats,'' Occhetto said Wednesday.
   But the move could also backfire and cost the Communist Party
its hardcore supporters, lead to a split in party ranks and
strengthen the Christian Democrats' No. 1 position.
   ``The step taken by Achille Occhetto has unquestionable
historical importance and like all moves of such nature carries
risks, firstly that of losing somebody and something along the
way,'' said Turin's moderate La Stampa newspaper in a front-page
commentary.
   In recent elections, the Communists have held on to their No. 2
position but have dropped from the 34 percent of the vote they
received in 1976, when they came to the brink of power, to around
27 percent. In the meantime, claimed membership has fallen from
some 2 million in 1953 to less than 1.5 million.
   Still, in a Europe that has seen ruling Soviet bloc Communist
parties begin to crumble and the once powerful French party reduced
to a small opposition role, Italy's Communists stand out as major
vote-getters.
   The party has long pledged adherence to Western parliamentary
democracy, criticized Moscow's military intervention in
Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Afghanistan in 1979 and voiced its
support for Italy's membership in NATO.
   Successive U.S. administrations, however, have opposed the
party's participation in Italian government, expressing wariness
over its stand on strategic issues.
   The party opposed the installation of cruise nuclear missiles in
Italy in a NATO initiative to counter a Soviet missile buildup and
the transfer to Italy of a squadron of U.S. fighter-bombers forced
to leave Spain.
   Italian news agencies quoted U.S. Ambassador Peter Secchia as
telling reporters during a visit to Bolgona on Wednesday that
``changes are always welcome'' but that the proposed change of name
was an issue for the party and not the U.S. administration.
   Occhetto made his formal proposal to a meeting of his party's
leadership on Tuesday, saying the party had to keep up with the
changes taking place in Europe or risk losing its ``special
identity.''
   In other words, there is no more political mileage for a party
that presents itself as a critic of international communism if
international communism fades away.
   Occhetto's aim is to lure the smaller Socialist Party and other
leftist groups under one political banner, presenting itself as an
alternative to the Christian Democrats.
   But the Socialists have been coalition partners of the Christian
Democats for the past decade and it seems doubtful that party
leader Bettino Craxi would ally himself with another leftist party
that receives twice as many votes.
   Craxi's ``long march'' strategy has been aimed at eventually
overtaking the Communists to secure him leadership of the Italian
left.
   Occhetto's plan will be considered by the 300-member Central
Committee in the coming days and then probably submitted to an
extraordinary congress for approval next year, perhaps before
spring municipal elections.
   Occhetto said it was premature to come up with the new name but
party leaders have discussed a number of possibilities over the
past few months including ``Workers Party,'' ``Italian Democratic
Party'' and ``Party of the United Left.''

   Doctors today transplanted the heart of an
Israeli soldier who was killed in an Arab guerrilla attack into a
Palestinian patient, Israeli officials said.
   Hanna Khader, 54, a former hotel manager from east Jerusalem,
was recovering and in stable condition in the intensive care ward
at Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem after the four-hour
operation, the family said.
   Thirteen family members gathered in the hospital lobby
afterward, crying and hugging each other.
   ``I can't tell you how happy I am,'' said Mary, his 51-year-old
wife. He's a human being, and there is no difference between a
Palestinian and an Israeli in such cases.''
   Jamilla, Khader's 29-year-old daughter, said the family was not
told by the hospital who donated the heart but learned of it from
the media.
   She indicated family members had some concern that they could be
targeted by radical Palestinians or fundamentalists for accepting
an Israeli heart but said: ``In such cases we cannot mix politics
with medicine.
   ``If we refused to take the heart it would be like killing him
with our own hands,'' she said, adding that she would do the same
if one of her family had an organ needed by an Israeli.
   The Israeli-born soldier, reservist Sgt. Zeev Traum, 40, who
grew up in New York and lived on an Israeli collective farm, died
Wednesday night of a head wound suffered in an ambush Monday.
   Traum was the second trooper to die in the attack claimed by the
Palestinian Moslem fundamentalist Hamas group. He was the 42nd
Israeli victim of a 23-month-old Palestinian uprising in which 615
Arabs also have died.
   Spokesmen at Hadassah could not be reached, but an Israeli
official who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed that the
soldier's family had donated the heart to the Arab patient.
   The family ``agreed immediately to make the donation simply out
of pure generosity, but they are in mourning and don't want to talk
about it,'' the official said.
   Traum's heart was brought to Jerusalem in a special ice chest by
helicopter from Soroka Hospital in the southern Israeli town of
Beersheba shortly before midnight.
   The surgery conducted by Dr. Dov Simon was the ninth heart
transplant done in Israel.
   It was the first known case since the uprising began of an
Israeli victim donating an organ to a Palestinian.
   In December, the family of a Palestinian shot to death by
Israeli soldiers in the West Bank town of Nablus refused a request
to donate their son's heart to a dying Israeli civilian.
   The Palestinian, Nasr Hawwash, 20, was declared brain dead after
sustaining a serious head wound Dec. 16 during a demonstration.
   The Israeli accountant Yehiel Israeli, 46, had been hooked to a
respirator on Dec. 18 after unsuccessful surgery on a heart valve.
He died three days later.

   An arson fire destroyed the home of a
vocal supporter of a play about AIDS shortly before its debut in
this conservative Ozark town.
   Investigators believe it was related to his involvement to ``The
Normal Heart.''
   ``It does look like there may be some connection'' between Brad
Evans' support for the play and the fire, said Springfield fire
investigator Kent Turner.
   Evans, 22, is president of the group People Acting with
Compassion and Tolerance, which led an effort to produce ``The
Normal Heart'' at Southwest Missouri State University. He was
attending an opening-night candlelight vigil outside the theater
when the fire was reported at 7 p.m. Wednesday, Turner said. Two
cats died in the fire.
   No other disruptions were reported after a week of
demonstrations for and against the production at the state
university.
   ``It doesn't discourage me,'' said Evans. ``But I never thought
anything like this would happen.''
   There were no arrests, Turner said.
   The back door to the single-story house had been forced open and
flammable liquid was found on the floors of two rooms in the house,
he said.
   ``The Normal Heart,'' written by gay activist and writer Larry
Kramer, is set in New York in the early 1980s. The drama, which
appeared off-Broadway in 1985, attacks society's slow response to
the AIDS crisis.
   Opponents of the play, including state Republican Rep. Jean
Dixon of Springfield and Citizens Demanding Standards leader Paul
Summers, said it promotes homosexuality. They called it obscene and
contrary to the moral standards of the community and should not be
supported with tax money.
   On Wednesday night as the play opened, several dozen security
officers stood outside the theater, but a lone protester peacefully
handed out leaflets stating that the Bible was against
homosexuality.
   Wednesday's soldout performance capped a week of protests at the
school.
   On Tuesday, actress Tess Harper joined faculty members and about
300 others at her former school in blasting opponents of the play.
   On Monday, more than 1,200 opponents of the play packed a hall.
They sang gospel songs and heard fiery speeches against the
production.

   Two passenger trains collided in southern
Italy today, and police said at least 15 people were killed.
   The crash between the two local trains headed in opposite
directions occurred just south of this Ionian Sea coast city, in
the southern tip of the Italian peninsula.
   First reports said one of the trains had just departed the
Crotone station headed to Catanzaro.
   There was no immediate word on the injured, but rescue squads
were called in from a number of surrounding towns.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
criticized people who say there is little chance the two Germanys
will reunite, an apparent response to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
comments on the subject.
   ``He who does not want to make decisions for our people should
not try to persuade them the best thing is a division of our
fatherland,'' Kohl said in his first speech to Parliament on East
Germany's historic border openings.
   In East Germany, the leader of a political party long allied
with the ruling Communists but now asserting independence said the
Communists' control of the government will be challenged during a
Parliament session Friday.
   In another development, East Germany's Communist Party daily
Neues Deutschland announced today in a front-page report that its
longtime chief editor had been replaced. The report said the change
occurred after the staff of the orthodox publication engaged in ``a
confrontation with the past.''
   It said editor Herbert Naumann was replaced by Wolfgang
Spickermann to promote change at the newspaper, until now a forum
for harsh attacks on Western capitalism and even on the reforms of
Gorbachev, the Soviet president.
   Reunification has become an increasingly important topic
following the growing unrest in Communist East Germany that led to
the new government of President Egon Krenz and the decision to open
the nation's borders.
   Gorbachev on Wednesday said talk about reunification ``would
mean interference in the affairs'' of East Germany and West Germany.
   But Kohl, who did not mention Gorbachev, said East Germans
``must be able to decide for themselves, which path they want to
follow in the future.''
   Kohl said West Germany would ``respect every decision made by
the people of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) in free
self-determination.''
   The chancellor claimed socialism is a ``total failure.'' A day
earlier, Gorbachev insisted the Communist revolution ``was not a
mistake.''
   Kohl pledged to NATO and European Economic Community allies that
West Germany remains committed to the integration in Western
Europe. Kohl also said ``solution of the German problem and the
overcoming of Europe's division are inseparably linked.''
   During today's debate in Parliament, former Chancellor Willy
Brandt said he doesn't have the impression East Germans want
reunification soon.
   ``Apparently they see the question of free elections as the
matter of priority,'' said the 75-year-old Social Democrat.
   British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd, commenting on
reunification during a visit to West Berlin today, said it is not
realistic now. ``It is not actively on the agenda. ... It is not
what people in the GDR (East Germany) are pressing for,'' Hurd told
reporters at the city's Reichstag building.
   Krenz, who is also Communist Party chief, met with leaders of
allied political parties and the new parliamentary speaker,
Guenther Maleuda, to discuss the other parties' call for a better
power-sharing arrangement among the recognized political groups.
   The official ADN news agency, reporting on the meeting, said the
leadership wants a commission formed to draw all political and
popular movements into the reform process. Maleuda has called for
the creation of a multiparty government.
   Manfred Gerlach, head of East Germany's Liberal Democractic
Party, said his country's constitutional guarantee of a ``leading
role'' for the Communist Party would be challenged at Friday's
session of the increasingly independent-minded parliament.
   It was not known whether a vote on the change would come the
same day.
   ``I figure it will pass with a large majority,'' Gerlach said in
an interview with West Germany's ARD radio network.
   Gerlach predicted free elections as early as next year and that
the Communists would fail to win a majority.
   Hundreds of people, meanwhile, waited on both sides of the
Berlin Wall for a possible opening of a border crossing at the
Brandenburg Gate. The gate, Berlin's best-known landmark, has
symbolized the division of Germany since the Wall was built in
1961. East Berlin has opened 22 border crossings at the Wall since
lifting travel restrictions Thursday and there has been wide
speculation that an opening at the gate is next.
   In response to East German's move toward reforms, West German
Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann has offered massive aid similar
to the U.S. Marshall Plan that helped rebuild war-ravaged Western
Europe after the Nazi defeat.
   But the offer is conditional on fundamental changes in East
Germany's economic and political systems.
   East German officials have spurned the offer, saying they prefer
their own recovery course. They have made it clear that they are
not ready to abandon their centrally-planned economic system.

   Bush signed the measure on Wednesday, the White House said.
   The legislation renames the federal building at 1919 Smith St.

   Leland was a leader of congressional efforts to alleviate world
hunger. He was killed with 15 others in the Aug. 7 crash of a plane

<HEAD>House Refuses To Set Air Force Plane Aside for Speaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley can make use of
an Air Force plane on a case-by-case basis when he needs to travel
on official government business, but no ``Air Force Three'' will be
set aside for him.
   That is the result of action taken by the House Wednesday, a day
after reports that an amendment in a defense appropriations bill
would have given Foley the same reserved-plane privilege now
enjoyed only by the president and vice president.
   In adopting a $286 billion military spending bill, House members
agreed to a substitute provision that would make an Air Force
aircraft available to Foley if he requested it. But no specific
C-20 plane would be kept ready for his call at Andrews Air Force
Base in nearby Maryland.
   Under what has been described as a gentleman's agreement, the
Defense Department has traditionally furnished the speaker with a
plane on request. Foley is next in line of presidential succession
after Vice President Dan Quayle.
   When reporters asked presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
Wednesday about an earlier proposal to set aside an aircraft for
Foley, he said, ``I doubt that the proposal will fly once it is
exposed to the American people's scrutiny.''
   ``We worked it out with the Air Force,'' Rep. John Murtha,
D-Pa., said after the House agreement to keep the old arrangement.
Murtha is chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee on
defense who, according to congressional sources, had inserted the
change into the bill.
   Murtha said the committee had felt strongly that ``because of
the speaker's high responsibility'' and incidents of terrorism a
plane should be designated for his use. But, he said, ``we had
trouble with the technical language.''
   The Defense Department already provides a jet for the president,
known as Air Force One; and for the vice president, dubbed Air
Force Two.
   It remained unclear whether Foley had requested a change, but
his staff seemed surprised when told it was part of the bill.
   Questioned at midday about the possibility of having a $20
million aircraft at his disposal, Foley said there has never been a
case where the speaker has been denied use of an aircraft for
official purposes.
   ``I am sure that will continue. Nor would I ever suppose that
any aircraft would be assigned exclusively to me and not be
available for other use under appropriate circumstances for
official purposes,'' he said.

   John Seigenthaler is assuming
responsibility for the business side of The Tennessean and
relinguishing his title of editor as part of a realignment of
duties at the Gannett Co. Inc.-owned newspaper.
   Seigenthaler was named chairman, publisher and chief executive
officer of The Tennessean. He is also editorial director of
Gannett's USA Today.
   Under a joint operating agreement with the Nashville Banner, The
Tennessean handles all advertising, circulation, production and
distribution functions for the two newspapers. The news departments
remain separate. The Nashville Banner is owned by The Nashville
Banner Publishing Co.
   Seigenthaler gave up the title of editor to E. Frank Sutherland
Jr., who returns to The Tennessean. Sutherland was editor of The
Times in Shreveport, La.
   C.W. Johnson, now deputy managing editor, will be promoted to
managing editor to replace Wayne Whitt, who is retiring. Metro
Editor Teresa Wasson moves to deputy managing editor.
   Joseph P. Pepe of the Gannett corporate staff was named
president and chief operating officer of The Tennessean. Pepe has
been coordinating Gannett's customer service program since July. He
had been executive vice president for operations at the El Paso
(Texas) Times since 1987.
   ``I'm honored by the confidence and challenge by Gannett,'' said
Seigenthaler. ``I'm elated by the appointment of Joe Pepe and
personally gratified to see Frank Sutherland come back to where he
started.''
   Harry Browning, who had been president and general manager of
The Tennessean, was named a general executive of Gannett.
   The changes were announced Wednesday by Brian Donnelly,
president of Gannett's Metro Newspaper Division.

<TEXT>
   The government has declared all
whites-only beaches open to blacks and will repeal the law that
allows local officials to segregate public facilities, President
F.W. de Klerk announced today.
   ``The time has arrived to repeal this act,'' he said, referring
the Separate Amenities Act that his National Party put into law in
1953.
   Since then, the act has been used by white local governments
across the country to bar blacks from parks, libraries, swimming
pools, civic centers, buses and a range of other amenities.
   In many communities, most or all of these amenities are now
opened to all races. But whites-only facilities persist in the
capital, Pretoria, in many rural towns, and in several small
industrial cities where the far-right Conservative Party took power
in municipal elections last year and re-introduced segregation laws.
   The proposed repeal ``is the beginning of the end of a separate
white community life,'' said Koos van der Merwe, chief spokesman
for the Conservatives, who urged whites to oust de Klerk.
   ``The steps which now will inevitably follow will be the
scrapping of separate residential areas, separate schools and
separate voters' rolls,'' he said. ``Mr. de Klerk is placing South
Africa on the road of a totally racially mixed South Africa, which
will inevitably be governed by a black majority.''
   De Klerk, addressing a high-level advisory group called the
President's Council, said the Separate Amenities Act would be
repealed ``as soon as possible'' after Parliament reconvenes on
Feb. 2.
   The repeal would leave three major categories of segregation in
South Africa _ residential neighborhoods, public hospitals and
public schools.
   The government is in the process of designating certain
neighborhoods as multiracial, although it says whites will retain
the option of living in segregated areas. De Klerk has given no
signal that public schools and hospitals will be integrated.
   Anti-apartheid leaders had anticipated either repeal or revision
of the Separate Amenities Act, and said any change, while welcome,
would not affect the political domination of the 5 million whites
over the 32 million blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race.
   Activists have demanded the repeal of the two remaining
legislative cornerstones of apartheid _ the Group Areas Act, which
segregates residential areas, and the Population Registration Act,
which officially classifies all South Africans by race.
   De Klerk said repeal of the Separate Amenities Act would be
undertaken ``with careful consideration of the implications of such
a step.'' He said ``fitting measures'' would be taken to ensure
that the opening of segregated facilities did not lead to
overcrowding, an increase in crime or environmental problems.
   Steps to integrate whites-only beaches ``should be taken and
implemented without any delay,'' he said.
   Many beaches have been opened to all races in recent years, but
segregated beachfronts remain the country's main resort city,
Durban, and several smaller resort communities. Durban's city
council recently voted down a beach integration proposal.
   ``It has been decided that all beaches will henceforth be
accessible to all members of the public,'' de Klerk said. ``Insofar
as ordinances or bylaws may exist in conflict with this, the local
authorities are requested to act within the spirit of this
decision.''
   De Klerk, who took office in August, said his announcements were
``in line with our stated goal to eliminate discrimination.''
   His announcements were the latest in a series of moves aimed at
enhancing the prospects for black-white negotiations on a new
constitution that would extend political rights to blacks while
protecting white interests.
   Among these moves:
   _Eight prominent political prisoners, including seven leaders of
the outlawed African National Congress, were freed unconditionally
on Oct. 15.
   _For the first time in years, the government has allowed mass
demonstrations and marches by anti-apartheid activists.
   _De Klerk and other officials have sharply increased government
contacts with opposition leaders, holding meetings with nationally
known and local activists.
   ``There is no alternative for South Africa but the road of
reconciliation,'' de Klerk said today. ``The government is not
playing games ... We are in deadly earnest with regard to the road
on which we have embarked.''
   He said the government had spent the equivalent of $70 million
since 1983 upgrading beaches and would continue this program with
the aim of minimizing overcrowding and possible racial friction. He
said local authorities would retain powers to control potential
crowding problems.
   De Klerk said the the government would support
``non-discriminatory methods to ensure acceptable behavior,
civilized standards and compliance with the law.''

<TEXT>
   An American woman and two West Germans
turned up in good health in Lebanon today, and relatives and West
German authorities said the three claimed they had not been
kidnapped.
   A previously unknown group said Wednesday it had abducted the
three.
   Relatives and West German Ambassador Wolfgang Gottelmann said
Deborah Fahrend, 54, and naturalized West Germans Mounir Shamseddin
Sami, 39, who was born in Lebanon and his son, Danjel, 7, born in
Berlin would leave for Cyprus later in the day by ferry.
   ``They are free. They presented themselves this morning at the
consular section of the embassy after they had read the reports (of
their kidnapping). There was no kidnapping,'' Gottelmann told The
Associated Press by telephone.
   He disputed a family member's comment that the three had been
robbery victims rather than hostages.
   ``They had not been robbed. They were already back in east
Beirut ready to return to Cyprus when the claim was issued. They
had come to Lebanon to see the man's family,'' he added.
   He said: ``The American lady was a friend of the family. They
cannot explain how this happened. I doubted this thing from the
beginning.''
   A relative said the three ``called from the West German Embassy
in Christian east Beirut to report that they were O.K.''
   The relative, who refused to be further identified, said Mounir
Shamseddin Sami told relatives by telephone that the three were
``robbed by gunmen.''
   ``He didn't say where they were robbed,'' the relative added.
   Ms. Fahrend, 54, of San Francisco, was ``with Sami and the boy.
They are all O.K.,'' the relative added.
   The discrepancies between the various accounts of what happened
could not immediately be reconciled.
   ``It seems those who robbed them also took their passports,
photocopied them and issued the claim hoping to make some money,''
the relative said.
   A Beirut police spokesman, who cannot be name in line with
standing regulations, said: ``It's a strange story. I don't believe
that they were held against their will.''
   In Bonn, a West German government spokesman said the three
insisted they were not abducted. ``They showed up at the (West
German Embassy in Beirut) saying they could not explain why it was
reported they were kidnapped,'' said Foreign Ministry spokesman
Rainer Mueller. He said the three went to the embassy this morning
and were all in good health.
   ``They told the embassy they went there because they were upset
about news reports of their kidnapping,'' said Mueller.
   The kidnapping claim was made in a typewritten statement, in
Arabic, by a group calling itself The Organization of Just Revenge.
The statement was delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut with
photocopies of the passports and visas of the three people.
   ``The Organization of Just Revenge announces its responsibility
for kidnapping the West German Mounir Sami (born in Lebanon) and
his son Danjel Sami and American publisher-journalist Deborah
Fahrend in Beirut for their activities in Lebanon,'' it said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced to
reporters flying with President Bush to Houston today that the
three had turned up.
   ``The West German government has informed us that the three
people kidnapped in Beirut yesterday _ two Germans and one U.S.
citizen _ are in the West German Embassy in Beirut. All three are
reported in good health. That's all we have. The cable just came to
the president,'' Fitzwater said.
   Ms. Fahrend, 54, is a nurse and sometime poet who had described
herself as a ``publisher-journalist.'' She reportedly had gone to
war-torn Lebanon in hopes of writing a book on what she called her
``chance in a lifetime.''
   It could not be immediately determined whether the three knew
each other.
   Eighteen foreigners are held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian factions.

<HEAD>24-Hour Strike Shuts Down Mines, Factories in Bolivia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 24-hour general strike called to
protest a government crackdown on labor unrest idled mines and some
factories in Bolivia today, but businesses and transportation
appeared to be operating normally.
   On Wednesday, the 3-month-old government of President Jaime Paz
Zamora declared a state of siege and rounded up hundreds of
teachers and labor leaders after negotiations with striking
teachers broke down.
   The three-month state of siege expands police powers and allows
state governments to limit public meetings. The center-left
government said it acted to guarantee peaceful local elections next
month.
   ``We are calling for the strike to demand the freedom of all the
leaders, students and workers detained by the repressive
government,'' said Filemon Escobar, leader of the Bolivian Workers
Central, the main union federation.
   At least half of the 858 teachers and labor leaders arrested
Wednesday were later released, said the Interior Ministry. The
state of siege authorized police to detain people without charges
for 48 hours.
   Today's strike closed the 14 government-owned mines and some
factories, but in La Paz and other cities businesses were operating
normally.
   Teachers refused to hold final exams scheduled today and said
they will not hand out report cards unless they receive the
one-time $103 bonus they are demanding to make up for inflation.
   ``In declaring the state of siege the government revealed its
real undemocratic face in violating the constitution and the law,''
said a statement by the Workers Central calling for the 24-hour
general strike today.
   The Workers Central, which is made up of the country's principal
unions, also demanded new talks between the government and teachers.
   ``After three months in power President Jaime Paz Zamora shows
he cannot resolve the basic problems of the Bolivian people,'' said
the statement.
   The government has said it cannot afford to pay the bonus and
will not negotiate under pressure.
   Three of the leaders of the teachers union were taken to a
private clinic in critical condition after being on a hunger strike
for 24 days.
   ``Our hands will not tremble to impose order and the law,'' said
congressman Luis Vazques, a member of the governing Movement of the
Revolutionary Left. ``This government respects the constitution but
demands that democracy be respected. We wish to defend the values
of democracy.''
   The state of siege was also enacted to guarantee the municipal
elections scheduled for Dec. 3. It imposes a 1:00-to-5:00 a.m.
curfew. There are no restrictions, however, on political
advertisement or intercity or foreign travel, says the prefect of
La Paz, Fernando Cajias.
   Bolivian cities were calm Wednesday after the state of siege was
declared. In recent days there have been widespread confrontations
between rock-throwing protesters and police who used tear gas to
break up marches and road blocks.
   Bolivia, South America's poorest country, has a minimum monthly
wage of $25. Teachers earn an average of $75 a month, and education
makes up 18 percent of the federal budget.

   The Navy's top safety officer said he had no
explanation for the string of 10 accidents during the past three
weeks that prompted a stand-down of all Navy units.
   ``Sometimes there just is no answer,'' Capt. Ferguson Norton,
commander of the Navy Safety Center, said Wednesday. ``Never in the
history of the modern Navy have so many (accidents) happened at one
time.''
   Ten people have been killed or lost at sea and at least 71 have
been injured in Navy accidents during the past three weeks.
   On Tuesday, Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett III and
Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, chief of naval operations, ordered all
Navy units to suspend normal operations and spend 48 hours of 72
hours this week reviewing procedures and training and reminding all
hands of safety measures.
   The stand-down affected such far-flung outposts as the Navy's
Subic Bay base in the Philippines and the 7th Fleet based in
Yokosuka, Japan.
   ``Basically, the training has essentially stopped here at
Subic,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri, a spokesman at the Philippines
base where 5,000 sailors are stationed. ``Support of ships is
continuing, but everyone is taking the guidance (safety review
order) extremely seriously.''
   In the sensitive Persian Gulf region, the crews of most Navy
ships, including three minesweepers, were allowed to continue their
duties and put off the safety check until time allowed, a spokesman
said.
   ``We are always vigilant and we try to maintain the highest
state of readiness always,'' said Joe Bartlett, spokesman for the
naval force in the Gulf. ``We put emphasis on safety at all times.''
   Norton, whose command analyzes all Navy accidents worldwide,
compared the order to a timeout in an athletic contest.
   ``It gives you a chance to review your game plan and get back to
the basics. A timeout also can be called to halt the momentum of
the opponent ... in this case, the string of mishaps,'' he said.
   Norton said the center's analysis of the accidents found no
common denominator linking them, nor any indication that budget
cuts played any role.
   On Tuesday, 31 people were injured in a fire aboard the
amphibious assault ship USS Inchon while it was docked at a Norfolk
repair yard.
   The most serious of the recent accidents occurred Oct. 29 when a
jet pilot making his first landing on an aircraft carrier crashed
into the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico. The pilot and four
others were killed.
   The destroyer USS Kinkaid and a freighter collided in the
Malacca Strait off Indonesia, killing one Navy crewman, injuring
five and starting fires on both vessels Saturday _ early Sunday in
Asia.
   Last Thursday, a Navy reserve pilot flying an A-7E jet crashed
into an apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians and
injuring two others, including himself.
   Norton said the Navy's record of safety has been steadily
improving. According to Navy figures, there were 118 major
accidents during operations in 1984. That figure has dropped to 69
so far this year.
   However, the number of fatalities for 1984 was 64; 102 sailors
have been killed so far this year, including 47 in the April 19 gun
turret explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa.
   Stand-downs have happened before. In June, the Marine Corps
ordered all its aviation units to stop normal activities for two
days of refresher safety training.
   But Norton said the current stand-down is the most widespread in
memory.
   Lt. Cmdr. Steve Burnett, a Navy spokesman, said Atlantic Fleet
ships at sea will not be called home for the safety drill but will
stand-down at sea.

<TEXT>
   Diethard Wietsche has gone back to East
Germany, where he says he spent 10 years in prison for trying to
escape, because he's disappointed with life in the capitalist West.
   He says he now has hope for promised changes in his Communist
homeland.
   Wietsche was one of about 60 East Germans who had arrived by
Wednesday at the East Berlin center where the government welcomes
back prodigal sons and daughters.
   ``Every day about 30 people knock on the door here and ask to
re-enter the German Democratic Republic,'' said Peter Heyn, deputy
chief of the center in Berlin's northeastern Buch district. ``The
climate in the Federal Republic (West Germany) has gotten colder.''
   He predicted the center soon would reach its capacity of 150
people.
   It is not clear how many of the East Germans who fled to West
Germany this year might return home now that Communist leaders in
East Berlin have opened of the borders to free travel and promised
a more open society.
   About 200,000 East Germans, most of them young and skilled, had
emigrated to their rich western neighbor this year before the
authorities buckled under the pressure of a peaceful popular revolt
and threw open their borders.
   West Germany's ZDF television network said Wednesday about 7,000
disillusioned East Germans were expected to turn their backs on
their rich neighbor, but officials on both sides of the border said
there were no signs of a major organized return for the time being.
ZDF gave no source for its report.
   An air of old-style secrecy surrounds the East Berlin government
returnee center, East Germany's only one until the national Red
Cross started setting up several of its own this week.
   Gray corrugated-metal fences keep outsiders from peering in.
Patrolling soldiers demand identification from anyone wanting to
enter the eight-story building.
   But Heyn said ``we are trying everything'' to simplify
procedures for regaining East German citizenship.
   Wietsche, 33, a native East German who said he was jailed for 10
years for trying to flee to the West, said West German society
wasn't for him.
   ``But what made the biggest difference was the fall of Erich
Honecker,'' Wietsche said. The hard-line East German leader who
oversaw the construction of the Berlin Wall was ousted Oct. 18.
   A car mechanic, Wietsche said he moved legally to the Bavarian
city of Regensburg two years ago after he was released from jail.
He said he expects reforms to begin soon under Egon Krenz, who
replaced Honecker.
   A 48-year-old warehouse worker who would not give his name said
he left West Germany a few days ago after four years, feeling
``totally disappointed.''
   ``I was allegedly too old for a job,'' he said. ``It wasn't for
me. I wanted to come back mainly because of the security, which I
missed quite a bit in the Federal Republic.''
   The East German Red Cross, which said it was preparing for a
wave of up to 10,000 people returning, opened four reception
centers along the border with West Germany. Authorities in cities
such as Magdeburg and Erfurt readied emergency shelters in military
barracks, schools and dormitories.
   West German Red Cross officials in Bonn said buses were on
standby but no organized return was planned.
   Dispatches by East Germany's state-run news agency ADN Wednesday
suggested only a trickle of returnees had arrived at the official
centers.
   Officials said the flow back to East Germany would be difficult
to document since many people would simply return to their homes.
   East German officials say the government will loan each person
who returns 150 marks, or $82, in immediate aid and 15 marks, or
$8, for each day of unemployment.

   President Bush flew here today for the funeral of
C. Fred Chambers, a onetime Texas oil business associate and close
friend of nearly four decades.
   Bush arrived aboard Air Force One for the morning Mass at St.
Michael's Catholic Church. It was to be a private service.
   The president was accompanied by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Baker's wife Susan, former Houston residents.
   Chambers and Bush met in the 1950s in the oilfields of Midland,
Texas, where both were beginning oil-industry careers. They
continued the friendship in Houston through the 1960s and, as
recently as June, Chambers and his family were guests in the White
House.
   Chambers died Monday at 71.
   A retired Navy lieutenant, Chambers was a co-founder of CNK
Petroleum. He retired from the company in 1981 but remained an
active supporter of education, the arts and political campaigns.
   The president had no other events scheduled in Houston and
planned to return immediately to Washington.
   Bush included a letter from Chambers in his 1987 autobiography
``Looking Forward.''
   ``We lived in the same small town, knew the same group of
people, had children about the same ages and were associated by our
mutual interest in the oil industry,'' Chambers wrote of his
friendship with Bush. ``Somebody had a rig, someone knew of a deal,
and we were all looking for funds. Oil was the thing in Midland.''
   In that book, Bush related that one of his early trips to the
nation's capital had been with Chambers, as the two came on ``a
brisk Washington day'' in search of financial backing for a
``sure-fire producer'' well in West Texas.
   They got the money, but Bush recounted, ``our sure-fire
proposition didn't do as well as we'd hoped, though from a tax
standpoint the investors came out ahead.''
   Chambers was quoted in an August 1988 Washington Post story on
Bush's early days as recalling a conversation in the late 1950s
when Bush, ``out back after a tough day, ties loosened, drinking
sake,'' confided that he was more interested in politics than in a
lifetime career in the oil business.
   In the 1970s, Bush and his wife, Barbara, named a family dog
``C. Fred'' after the friend.
   Although Bush went to dozens of funerals as vice president, it
is only his second as president. He recently attended the funeral
of the Episcopal bishop of Washington, John Walker.

<HEAD>Thailand Bans Asian Wall Street Journal for Story on Buddhism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said today they are banning
local distribution of the Asian Wall Street Journal because of a
story they said had insulted the leader of Thailand's predominant
Buddhist faith.
   The newspaper is to be banned beginning Friday, said Lt. Col.
Samphan Sresthaphon of the Police Special Branch.
   Samphan singled out a story published July 21 about the conflict
between the Supreme Patriarch and the Santi Asoke, a fundamentalist
sect that accused the mainstream faith of materialism and other
un-Buddhist practices.
   Samphan said the article by John Berthelson, a Journal
correspondent based in Bangkok, amounted to ``disrespect'' for the
Supreme Patriarch ``and created disunity among Buddhists.''
   ``The paper will be allowed to be sold again if it makes a
request to the police,'' he said.
   Barry Wain, editor of the Journal, issued a statement in Bangkok
today saying that he noted with concern reports of the ban. ``We
are seeking urgent clarification from the Thai authorities,'' the
statement said. ``If the press reports are correct we will appeal
immediately against the ban.''
   The Asian Wall Street Journal is owned mainly by Dow Jones &amp; Co.
of the United States, which also publishes the Wall Street Journal.
The Asian Journal's editorial headquarters in Hong Kong said 2,500
copies are distributed in Thailand.
   Samphan also said authorities on Nov. 2 had lifted a ban on the
local distribution of the South China Morning Post newspaper of
Hong Kong. It had been banned since July because of an article
about rumors of a military coup in Thailand.
   Samphan said the special branch police were considering action
against the Far Eastern Economic Review, a Hong Kong-based
newsweekly, because of a Nov. 2 article on Thai prostitution.
   And he said action also may be taken against The Economist, the
London-based newsweekly, for an article that he said satirized Thai
Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's policy on Cambodia.
   Last week, the Tourism Authority of Thailand issued a statement
protesting the Review article's suggestion that the authority
indirectly protected Thailand's huge sex industry because it draws
many foreign tourists.
   The Review's circulation in Thailand is 3,030, said its Hong
Kong editorial headquarters.
   Thailand is considered one of the freest countries in Southeast
Asia for the foreign press.

<TEXT>
   An American woman who was reported abducted
in Lebanon with a West German friend and his son had described her
visit to the war-torn country as a ``chance in a lifetime.''
   Deborah Fahrend and the two others went to the West German
Embassy in Beirut today and insisted they had not been kidnapped. A
family source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the three
were robbed of their passports.
   Fahrend, 54, formerly of San Francisco, told her family she had
planned to write a book about Lebanon and that she had a publisher
lined up.
   ``It seems to me to be a chance in a lifetime,'' Fahrend wrote
in a recent letter to her 89-year-old mother, Margaret Brooks.
   Fahrend had written books of poetry that she had printed herself
and distributed to her friends and relatives, said Brooks.
   ``She's creative and wants to do something, and she's still
searching for her fulfillment, and that's why she's doing the
writing,'' Fahrend's sister, Emily Rowe, said in a telephone
interview from the family home in Davis, 70 miles northeast of San
Francisco.
   Fahrend chose her last name three years ago. It means
``traveling'' in German. Her last name had been Corra, from her
ex-husband, whom she divorced about 20 years ago. Fahrend had been
living in West Berlin for the last four years.
   A previously unknown group said in Beirut on Wednesday it had
kidnapped an American woman and two naturalized West Germans _ a
man born in Lebanon and his 7-year-old son.
   The claim was made in a typewritten statement in Arabic for a
group calling itself The Organization of Just Revenge. The
statement was delivered to a Western news agency with photocopies
of the passports and visas of the three people.
   It described the woman as Fahrend, calling her a
publisher-journalist. The others were identified as Mounir
Shamseddin Sami, 39, born in Lebanon, and his son, Danjel, born in
Berlin.
   Brooks briefly had discussed the trip to Lebanon on the
telephone with her daughter but didn't discuss the possible
dangers. The State Department warns Americans not to travel to
Lebanon.
   Eighteen foreigners are in captivity there, including eight
Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In a letter to her mother last week, Fahrend wrote she was going
to Beirut with ``Munir'': ``I'm going to use Munir's connections to
the hilt,'' she said, referring to diplomatic friends he had in
Lebanon who could put her in contact with Druze and Sunni
officials, according to her sister.
   The mother said Deborah referred to Munir as her ``therapist and
really good friend'' when they visited the United States this
spring.
   The Munir in the message apparently was the ``Mounir'' mentioned
in the statement from the terrorists.
   Rowe added that just before moving to West Berlin, Fahrend
finished a master's degree in creative writing at San Francisco
State. She earlier earned undergraduate degrees in international
administration and registered nursing.
   Jane McCullough, a friend who lived in San Geronimo, 20 miles
north of San Francisco, said she received a card from Fahrend last
week that had been mailed from Cyprus on Nov. 1.
   The card read: ``I'm sending this Christmas greeting early this
year as I know I'll be swamped when I return. I'm on my way to
Beirut to visit Munir's family. While there I'll be doing some
interviewing so I can write about it from more than just my
perspective.''

<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO is enlisting perhaps the world's
most popular union leader, Lech Walesa, for an advertising campaign
and is banking heavily that the Polish Solidarity leader's fame
will help improve the image of U.S. unions.
   Walesa, wearing a ``Union Yes'' pin on his lapel, taped a
30-second spot earlier this week when he appeared at the labor
federation's convention.
   It took about 90 minutes to tape the spot because Walesa speaks
little English and the producers were not certain until Wednesday
that they would be able to cut a commercial from the tape.
   Most of his remarks are in Polish and translated by an
interpreter into English. But the ad ends with the onetime shipyard
electrician beaming and declaring the ``Union Yes'' slogan of the
federation's advertising campaign.
   The ad will air for the first time Tuesday night during ABC-TV's
situation comedy, ``Roseanne.'' The first planned run will end the
following Saturday with an airing during the Notre Dame-Miami
college football game.
   In that five-day period, the federation will spend $600,000 to
air the ad during those two nationally televised programs as well
as during dozens of local newscasts in major cities.
   The ``Union Yes'' campaign to date has relied on four actors and
actresses: Jack Lemmon, Tyne Daly, Howard Hesseman and Edward James
Olmos, who taped ads in both English and Spanish in an effort to
attract Hispanics.

   A man out on bond on assault charges
brought by his former girlfriend shot and killed her and two blind
co-workers as she drove them home from work, authorities said.
   Joe L. Westbrooks was charged with three counts of murder in the
Wednesday afternoon shotgun slayings of Paula Pearson, 32; and the
two blind people, Willis Thrasher, 34; and Carolyn Sullivan, 45,
authorities said.
   Westbrooks, 30, apparently followed Pearson from work to the
intersection where the shooting took place, Police Chief Ed Crider
said. Witnesses said the man pulled up beside Pearson's car, jumped
out and fired several times into the car.
   Westbrooks was arrested moments after the shooting, and a
12-gauge shotgun was confiscated, Crider said.
   Detective Wayne Tutor said Westbrooks, 30, had been charged
earlier with burglary and assault in connection with attacks on
Pearson.
   Rob Russell, her employer at BHR Co., a publishing company, said
Westbrooks called Pearson twice Wednesday and threatened to kill
her.
   ``A girlfriend of hers tried to get her to call the police, but
she didn't want to get him in any more trouble than he was in,''
Russell said.
   Pearson, a mother of three children, ``carried these two people
home from work every night and would go get them in the morning,''
said Russell.
   Russell said Westbrooks had harassed the eight-week employee of
his company since the couple's breakup a month ago.

<TEXT>
   Conservative Fernando Collor de
Mello led two left-wing rivals today in Brazil's first free
presidential election since 1960, according to preliminary returns.
   However, no candidate appeared likely to obtain a majority, and
Collor de Mello is probably headed for a runoff Dec. 17 against
populist Leonel Brizola or Rep. Inacio Lula da Silva.
   With 34 percent of Wednesday's vote counted, Collor de Mello, a
40-year-old former state governor, had 25 percent, or 6.9 million
votes, according to Globo TV, the country's largest commercial
network.
   Brizola, of the Democratic Labor Party, was second with 16
percent, tallying 4.5 million votes. Da Silva, of the
Marxist-oriented Workers' Party, trailed Brizola by less than
one-half percent, Globo said.
   In a suprisingly strong showing, Sen. Mario Covas of the
left-of-center Brazilian Social Democracy Party was fourth with 3.8
million votes, or about 14.2 percent of the total, Globo said.
   Computer problems reportedly slowed official results.
   At noon, 19 hours after the polls closed, the country's Superior
Electoral Court had tallied just 5.8 percent of the votes. It
showed Collor leading with 26.6 percent, followed by Brizola with
16.5 percent, Lula with 16.3 percent, and Covas with 8.9 percent.
   Final results are not expected until Saturday.
   More than 82 million voters cast ballots to choose a successor
to President Jose Sarney, who by law could not run for re-election.
The vote marked the return of full democratic rights after 21 years
of military rule.
   Sarney is a civilian, but he gained office in 1985 through an
electoral college vote coordinated by the military.
   Collor de Mello, 40, has been a harsh critic of Sarney. Leading
in the polls since April, his dapper good looks and anti-corruption
platform made Collor de Mello popular with the poor, a majority in
the Brazilian electorate.
   Sarney is widely blamed for official corruption and an annual
inflation rate of at least 1,300 percent.
   Brazilians ages 18 to 69 were required by law to vote.
   Federal police chief Romeu Tuma said in a television interview
that a small amount of illegal campaigning had been noted but
reported no other troubles in balloting across the nation of 150
million.
   The Superior Electoral Court originally said it would begin
releasing the first official results Wednesday night, then said
they would not be available until tonight.
   The Vote Announcement Center, packed with more than 5,000
journalists, workers, foreign dignitaries, government officials and
party heads, turned raucous when the electoral court announced the
delay. Several journalists and foreign ambassadors shouted at court
officials when no explanation was given.
   An electoral court official, who would not give his name, told a
reporter there was a problem with computer links between Brasilia,
the capital, and distant voting precincts.
   Promotional TV spots had said Brazil's computerized tallying
system would speed vote counting. The results in the 1960 election
were not announced for three months. Federal police guarded the
center during the night.
   Globo TV kept a parallel computer count and its partial results
showed the candidates leading in their regional strongholds.
   Collor de Mello, a former governor of the poor northeastern
state of Alagoas, received strong support in the northern and
northwestern regions. He also led in the southeastern city of
Curitiba and his home city of Maceio on the northeastern Atlantic
coast.
   Da Silva, a former labor leader, had support nationwide, and led
in the southeastern industrial city of Belo Horizonte and the poor
northeastern cities of Brasilia, Recife and Salvador.
   Brizola, a former governor of the states of Rio de Janeiro and
Rio Grande do Sul, appeared to have his strongest support in the
heavily populated southern part of the country. He led in the
southern capital cities of Porto Alegre, Florianoplis and Rio de
Janeiro, and the northern city of Fortaleza, according to Globo
TV's returns.
   Covas, a dark-horse candidate, held a strong lead in Sao Paulo,
the nation's biggest city, and was a solid second in Belo
Horizonte, the network reported. It also reported that about
130,000 people voted for popular TV game-show host Silvio Santos,
who tried to enter the race two weeks before the election but was
disqualified by the Electoral Court.
   Brazil's last free presidential election was in 1960, when Janio
Quadros won. Quadros quit after seven months in office, and the
ensuing confusion led to a 1964 ``anti-communist'' military coup.
   The generals banned popular elections for president, although
restricted regional voting was allowed.

<HEAD>Massachusetts Bond Rating Lowered, Tied with Louisiana As Nation's
Lowest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL BEEGAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massachusetts has tied Louisiana with the lowest
long-term bond rating of any state in the nation.
   ``We are at the bottom of the barrel,'' State Treasurer Robert
Q. Crane said Wednesday after Moody's Investors Service downgraded
the state's $8.5 billion in long-term debt from ``A'' to ``Baa 1.''
   Moody's cited a $721 million budget deficit, which has stopped
Gov. Michael Dukakis from talking about the ``Massachusetts
Miracle,'' his term for the state's rebounding economy in the mid
1980s.
   The move came the day before the state went to market with $140
million in short-term notes to pay off overdue bills in the
Medicaid program, which pays medical bills for the poor.
   ``The magnitude of the projected deficit is made all the more
onerous by the apparent lack of consensus on how to deal with it,''
Moody's said.
   Standard and Poor's Corp., the other major Wall Street
credit-rating service, let the state keep its ``A'' rating, but
placed it on CreditWatch and said it would lower the rating if
Massachusetts didn't resolve its difficulties by next month.
   Lower credit ratings mean a borrower has a greater risk of
default and must pay higher interest rates on new debt to
compensate lenders for the additional risk.
   The lowering does not directly affect short-term notes. Their
rating was lowered in June from the highest MIG 1 rating to MIG 2,
according to Moody's Vice President George Leung.
   The state plans to sell $250 million in long-term debt next
month, and Administration and Finance Secretary L. Edward Lashman
said that is when the higher interest rate caused by the lowered
bond rating really will hurt.
   Dukakis said he was not surprised by the lowered credit rating,
and he and Lashman said it was time for the Legislature to raise
taxes to solve the deficit problem.
   ``We've known for months that unless and until we get this
budget into balance our credit rating was in jeopardy,'' Dukakis
said. ``The best and the fastest way to do it is to pass a
responsible revenue package.''
   Moody's strongly criticized the state's inability to deal with
the deficit.
   The ratings service noted that the Legislature soundly rejected
a tax increase earlier this year, ``expressing a preference for
expenditure reductions to achieve budget balance.''
   But Moody's said the deficit-reduction package being debated by
the House would be worth only about $400 million.
   Leung said the House's vote Tuesday to reject a $46 million
revenue-raiser _ confiscating unclaimed beer and soda bottle and
can deposits from wholesalers _ played a role in the lowering of
the rating.
   Lashman called that House move ``the most irresponsible vote I
have ever seen.''
   Leung said the ratings service did not care whether the state
balanced the budget with cuts or taxes, or both. However, he said
it was unlikely the Legislature would be willing to balance the
budget with cuts alone.

   The CIA has launched a $3 million operation,
with the approval of congressional oversight committees, to
overthrow Panamanian Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, a newspaper reported
today.
   The covert operation has ``no restrictions'' other than an order
prohibiting Noriega's assassination and could involve U.S. troops,
the Los Angeles Times reported, citing unidentified sources.
   ``It is an unimpeded effort to try to topple Noriega,'' one
source told the Times. ``We're going into it with the understanding
that there may be loss of life, though the effort will be not to
kill anyone.''
   President Bush said at Andrews Air Force Base, Md., before
leaving for Houston today that he would neither confirm nor deny
the report.
   ``If there was a covert operation, would I discuss it, ever? It
wouldn't be covert if I even referred to it, so there will be no
such discussion of anything, which means I am not confirming nor
denying,'' he told reporters on Air Force One.
   Vice President Dan Quayle also declined to comment directly on
the report today. But when asked if it was proper for the United
States to try to get involved in an effort to oust Noriega, he
replied:
   ``It's certainly proper for the United States to state the
policy very clearly, and that policy is that the sooner Noriega
leaves power, the better off the people of Panama are going to be,
the better off the people of Central America are going to be. ...''
   Asked if the administration and Congress were still coordinated
on the effort to get Noriega out, Quayle said: ``The policy on
Panama and other issues are very closely coordinated with the
Congress. This president insists on consultation and he has gone
out of his way to consult with Congress on this and other matters.''
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since he was
indicted on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988 by federal
grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   ``What it boils down to is that we want him alive in the United
States or dead,'' one source told the Times.
   Sources told the newspaper the CIA believes disgruntled officers
within the Panama Defense Forces are willing to collaborate in the
overthrow.
   The operation has been dubbed Panama-5 _ a referrence to past
actions against Noriega _ and reflects a renewed commitment by the
Bush administration, which drew criticism following the failed Oct.
3 coup attempt by dissident Panamanian military officers.
   Administration officials presented the plans for the operation
to Senate and House intelligence committees three weeks ago, the
Times said.
   During the failed October coup, the Bush administration said its
hands were tied by a 13-year-old executive order banning U.S.
involvement in the assassination of foreign figures.
   Last month, the Justice Department was assigned to make clear a
series of Ford administration executive orders regarding
clandestine action, the Times reported.
   A clarification memo was written by William P. Barr, assistant
attorney general in charge of legal counsel, sent to CIA Director
William H. Webster and finally delivered to the House and Senate
Intelligence committees, the newspaper said.
   According to the Times, the memo paves the way for more active
U.S. involvement in coup attempts not meant to result in
assassination but that could result in death.

<HEAD>Bid to Relaunch Iraq-Iran Peace Talks Fails</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.N. envoy said today that the latest
efforts to revive peace talks between Iran and Iraq have failed.
   In a statement isssued by the United Nations in Baghdad, Swedish
diplomat Jan Eliasson said he has ended his 17-day round of
negotiations.
   Eliasson said that during his shuttle betweeen Tehran and
Baghdad, which included 12 meetings with officials of both
countries, he focused on how to implement a U.N. resolution
outlining a permanent peace accord.
   ``In the course of my talks with the representatives of both
governments, I suggested ways to move the talks forward within the
framework of (U.N.) Resolution 598 in order to achieve a
comprehensive and lasting peace in the region,'' he said.
   The resolution calls for a withdrawal of both sides' forces to
internationally recognized borders, an exchange of prisoners and
talks leading to a final peace settlement.
   The two sides went to war in 1979 after a series of border
skirmishes. Fighting ended with a tentative cease-fire on Aug. 20,
1988, but the sides have yet to agree on a permanent peace.
   The U.N. statement, which was simultanously released in Baghdad
and in Tehran, said Eliasson was hopeful that further indirect
talks at the ministerial level would take place later this year in
New York.
   Eliasson arrived in Baghdad Oct. 31 and held intensive talks
with officials from Iran and Iraq, including Presidents Saddam
Hussein and Hashemi Rafsanjani.
   Upon his arrival in the region, Eliasson and U.N. officials said
he was not bringing any specific ideas or proposals to the sides
but would try to convince them to find a formula for restarting the
negotiations.
   Neither side has given any idications that they are willing to
shift position since Eliasson began his shuttle more than two weeks
ago.
   But Eliasson expressed satisfaction that the 15-month-old truce
in the Persian Gulf war was holding well.
   Among the sticking points in the talks has been Iraq's claim on
the Shatt al-Arab waterway that forms part of the frontier between
the two nations.
   Baghdad insists that the border must be redrawn to include all
of the strategic waterway in Iraqi territory and has refused to
withdraw its troops from Iranian territory until the issue is
settled.
   Another point of contention is the issue of prisoners-of-war.
Iranian spiritual leader Ali Khamenei said Wednesday that Iraq must
disclose how many prisoners of war it is holding before any
exchange of POWs can take place.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moldavia's Communist Party chief was replaced
today after activists pushed for his ouster, saying he blocked
reform in the southwestern republic wracked by ethnic unrest.
   The official news agency Tass said Semyon K. Grossu was
``relieved of his duties'' by the republic's policy-making Central
Committee because of a transfer. It did not give his new post, but
the director of the republic's official news agency said he will
work in Moscow in an as-yet-undetermined job.
   His replacement is Pytor Luchinsky, 49, the No. 2 party official
in the republic of Tadzhikistan, Tass reported. The news agency
said he, like Grossu, is an ethnic Moldavian.
   There was no hint in the report that the Moldavian party was
unhappy with Grossu, but activists on Sunday began circulating a
petition demanding removal of conservatives in the top echelons of
the republic's government.
   Grossu and three of his deputies were on the petition because he
was an ``inactive arch-conservative'' blamed for economic,
ecological and political problems, said Konstantin Bogdanash, a
spokesman for the grassroots group People's Front that organized
the petition drive.
   The activists began the petition drive after a Nov. 10 clash
between police and protesters that left almost 200 people injured
in the capital, Kishniev.
   Grossu, 55, headed the Moldavian Communist Party since 1980 and
came under increasing pressure from nationalist activists to
reverse decades of ``Russification'' of the republic that borders
Romania.
   In the past year, Moldavian officials agreed to measures aimed
at preserving the Moldavian language and ethnic rights of the
indigenous population.
   Moldavia is one of the ethnic hotspots in the Soviet Union where
the local population is clamoring for more local control over the
culture, economy and politics.

   A veteran state senator from the
crack-infested Bronx has sponsored legislation to legalize drugs,
saying the war on drugs has failed.
   New Yorkers over age 21 should be able to buy marijuana,
cocaine, heroin or any drug over the counter, without a
prescription, just like a bottle of wine at a liquor store, state
Sen. Joseph Galiber contends.
   Galiber, in opening a hearing on his bill today, said his
proposal was years away from becoming law. But he said he hoped his
bill would be a first step toward some legalization.
   ``Five years ago, this legislation would probably have gotten
you run out of town,'' Galiber said. ``But the time is right now.''
   Robert Frohling, who monitors state drug laws for the
Denver-based National Conference of State Legislatures, agreed:
``There are more people jumping on the bandwagon, so there's more
credence being given to that type of alternative. It's not just
some sort of off-the-wall thing.''
   But Thomas Hedrick Jr., executive director of the Partnership
for a Drug-Free America, wondered, ``Is this a joke?''
   Those who have suggested legalization as a possible alternative
cut across the political spectrum.
   They include former Secretary of State George Shultz, economist
Milton Friedman and commentator William F. Buckley Jr. as well as
Democratic Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, Hodding Carter III who
served as the Carter administration's State Department spokesman,
and former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark.
   Still, there's little chance the New York bill will become law.
It has no co-sponsors and Gov. Mario Cuomo already has said he's
opposed to legalization.
   It's also unclear whether such a law could supersede federal
anti-drug laws. James Flateau, spokesman for Cuomo's chief criminal
justice adviser, said today that the federal government could still
prosecute New York drug cases under its authority to control
interstate commerce.
   Frohling said that even though legalizing all drugs was too
politically sensitive to become reality, he expected other states
to hold hearings on the idea next year.
   Galiber, a Democrat with 20 years in the Assembly, disclaims
drugs as a good thing. It's just that all the efforts to stop drug
use have failed, he said.
   Legalization, with a state-regulated drug industry, would
eliminate drug trafficking by taking away the huge profits
available to pushers, said Galiber.
   By taking away a pusher's profits, the state could put drug
dealers out of business and lessen chances that young children
would get hooked.
   The problem then would be teaching New Yorkers not to take drugs
and treating the ones that do, said Galiber, a former social worker.
   ``The so-called war on drugs, whatever it's called, hasn't
worked,'' said Galiber. ``We won't end the demand, but we can take
the huge profits out and remove the heinous criminal elements.''
   Galiber said his proposal might lead to a short-term increase in
drug use, but he predicted it would improve the state's chances of
solving the problem in the long run.
   ``The way it's going now, we're killing off our youth, we're
locking our adults and people into violence. People are killing
each other,'' Galiber said. ``I'm not suggesting that this is the
answer, but we have to try some alternatives.''
   Some people dislike his alternative, however.
   ``Legalizing illicit drugs would catastrophically expand the
addiction and use,'' said Hedrick, whose New York City-based
non-profit group produced the TV commercial equating a drug user's
brain with fried eggs. ``Remove the big economic issue and you
remove the criminal element? That's just not true.''
   Hedrick said the ``black market'' for narcotics would survive
even if drugs were legalized.
   ``God help us if anything comes of this,'' Hedrick said of the
Galiber legislation.
   Should anything come of it, Galiber's plan would create a new
state agency almost identical to the one that regulates the liquor
industry.
   Licenses to sell drugs would be given to doctors and
pharmacists, as long as they're not near schools or houses of
worship.
   The state would charge licensing fees of more than $1,000 a
year, and would charge sales tax. The revenues would pay for drug
treatment centers.

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit tumbled
from its 1989 high to an imbalance of $7.9 billion in September,
its lowest level in almost five years, as imports dropped sharply
from August's record level, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the September shortfall in the
trade balance represented a huge 21.4 percent drop from a revised
August deficit of $10.1 billion, which was the widest gap so far
this year.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the ``deficit for the
first three quarters of 1989 is at an annualized $107.2 billion, in
line with our expectations of moderate improvement to the $105
billion-$110 billion range.''
   Mosbacher said that the August record was an ``aberration,'' but
added that ``September's figure was significantly below the 1989
monthly average of $8.9 billion and must also be viewed
cautiously.''
   The narrowing imbalance resulted from a 3.9 percent decline in
imports to $39.1 billion and a 1.9 percent increase in exports to
$31.1 billion. The deficit is the difference between the two.
   The September deficit was the narrowest since a $6.8 billion
imbalance in December 1984.
   Preliminary estimates had put the September imbalance at about
$9 billion.
   Imports had jumped a revised 5 percent to a record $40.7 billion
in August, while exports increased a revised 0.3 percent to $30.6
billion.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for the Boston Co., had said the
drop in imports in the September report would be the consequence of
a slowing economy due to the Federal Reserve's tight rein on credit
as it strives to contain inflation.
   The stock markets were unenthusiastic about the report.
Observers said the decline in imports could be interpreted as
evidence of weakening consumer spending at a time when many
investors are worried about the outlook for corporate profits.
   At the same time, chief economist Robert G. Dederick of the
Northern Trust Co. of Chicago said the relatively stable exorts
would be the result of firm overseas markets despite the rising
value of the dollar, which makes U.S. products abroad more
expensive.
   For the first nine months of the year, exports increased 1.9
percent while imports decreased 3.9 percent.
   The deficit for the year on an annual basis was $107.2 billion,
compared with a $118.5 billion imbalance for all of 1988.
   Exports were led in September by a 72.8 percent improvement in
aircraft shipments to $1.97 billion. Aircraft exports had fallen
16.1 percent in August, contributing to the increase in that
month's deficit.
   Export improvements also included office equipment and
machinery, automobiles, telecommunications equipment and industrial
machinery.
   Contributing to the decrease in imports were industrial supplies
and big-ticket capital goods, consumer goods and foods.
   The nation's foreign oil bill fell 7.6 percent to $4 billion in
September. The amount of imported oil dropped to 8.2 million
barrels a day from 8.7 million in August, while the price per
barrel rose to $16.38 from $16.14.
   As usual, the largest trade deficit in September was with Japan,
an imbalance of $4.1 billion, up from $4 billion in August. The
deficit was $1.3 billion with Taiwan, $700 million with Canada,
$500 million with South Korea and $700 million with China.
   Sinai had said a deficit below $9.5 billion would be encouraging
because that would be an improvement over the $110 billion gap on
an annual rate posted six months ago.
   Imports tend to curb demand for U.S. produced goods and thus
dampen production and threaten the loss of jobs. Exports, on the
other hand, strengthen demand on domestic production and help
create more jobs.
   The August shortfall between imports and exports was the largest
imbalance in eight months and was 31 percent higher than the July
deficit of $8.24 billion. It was also the biggest deficit since
$10.8 billion last December.
   It prompted some analysts to express fear that the worsening
trade deficit signaled a return to much high imbalances, which
would act to dampen domestic growth in coming months.

<HEAD>Congress Investigating Pact Between Archives, Philip Morris</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: New material, editing throughout with today's testimony.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A congressional critic of an agreement between
Philip Morris Cos. and the National Archives to commemorate the
bicentennial of the Bill of Rights today lamented the ``pervasive
presence of tobacco companies on Capitol Hill.''
   The House subcommittee on transportation and hazardous materials
began an investigation of the agreement as the American Cancer
Society launched its 13th annual Great American Smokeout.
   Under the agreement, Philip Morris will donate $600,000 to the
National Archives Trust Fund in exchange for authority to publish
or broadcast announcements and materials promoting the 200th
anniversary of the Bill of Rights. The materials carry the names of
both Philip Morris and the National Archives.
   ``It's not the text of the ad that troubles me, it's the
context,'' said Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass.
   ``I am embarrassed, too, as a member of Congress by the
pervasive presence of tobacco companies on Capitol Hill ... you
can't have an event without it being cosponsored by the cigarette
industry,'' said Atkins.
   But Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., said, ``We have a long and
time-honored practice in the United States of allowing corporate
America to collaborate with public agencies in order to advertise
public events.''
   ``I would say, let's make one exception. Let's take a
corporation that sells a product that kills the largest number of
Americans ... let's say we'll put them in a little different
category,'' countered Atkins.
   ``Philip Morris has bought the exclusive rights to the
Constitution, which we entrusted to the National Archives, for the
modern equivalent of 30 pieces of silver or $600,000,'' Rep. Thomas
Luken, D-Ohio, chairman of the subcommittee, said in announcing
today's hearing.
   Luken and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., called Wednesday for
investigations into the two-year agreement between Philip Morris
and the Archives after a consumer health group urged that the
contract be revoked.
   ``It's more than coincidental'' that the bicentennial campaign
began shortly before the society's annual nationwide cigarette-free
day, said Cancer Society spokesman Alan Davis.
   ``Every year just prior to the smokeout one company or another
tries to grab headlines and change the agenda,'' Davis said.
   ``There is no cigarette called Philip Morris,'' said Guy L.
Smith, the company's vice president of corporate affairs. He said
he did not believe the announcements violated the ad ban.
   ``In the same week that the Berlin Wall is being torn down, that
people in this country are being criticized for celebrating the
Bill of Rights is very strange,'' Smith said.
   Congress specifically encourages the Archives to accept
tax-exempt donations ``to enhance its archival and outreach
activities,'' said Archives' spokeswoman Susan Cooper.
   She also said such efforts by the cigarette maker are no
different from the company's past sponsorship of exhibits at the
National Gallery of Art.
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-New Mexico, has written Don Wilson, the
archivist of the United States, questioning how and why the
agreement was made. The Health Research Group, a consumer health
group, last week wrote Bingaman asking Congress to revoke the
August agreement.
   Critics question whether the broadcast announcements violate a
1971 federal ban on cigarette advertisements on television and
radio.
   ``The Philip Morris ads are running on television and do not
contain any health warning and apparently are a flagrant violation
of the law prohibiting such video commercials,'' Luken said.
   ``You have to ask what does advertising mean,'' said John
Banzhaf, chief counsel for Action on Smoking and Health, a consumer
group that led efforts for the federal restrictions. ``It seems to
me this is advertising, since at least one of their purposes,
directly or indirectly, is to encourage the sale of cigarettes,''
he said.

<HEAD>Judge Speeds Up Payments to Vietnam Vet Victims of Agent Orange</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Vietnam veterans injured by the
toxic defoliant Agent Orange will get a big portion of their claim
payments before Christmas under a federal judge's order.
   ``The judge wants to get the payments to the veterans as soon as
possible,'' said Deborah Greenspan, a lawyer administering the
Agent Orange Veteran Payment Program.
   The disbursements, which will total nearly $30 million, won't
significantly change the total award an eligible veteran would
receive, but will provide a large share of it in a lump-sum payment.
   Some 9,300 veterans disabled by Agent Orange during their
Vietnam service will soon receive a single payment of as much as
$8,100, said Ms. Greenspan.
   ``From a veteran's point of view, I think it's significant,''
Ms. Greenspan said of the ruling made Wednesday by U.S. District
Judge Jack B. Weinstein of Brooklyn. ``It will give them a chunk of
money to work with.''
   The veterans getting the lump-sum checks will continue to
receive annual payments until 1994, but the amount of the annual
payments will be reduced to account for the lump-sum payment.
   Disabled veterans admitted into the Agent Orange Veteran Payment
Program by Wednesday are eligible for the payments, Ms. Greenspan
said.
   The changes, Weinstein said, are possible ``because an analysis
of claims processed to date reveals greater than expected funds
available for distribution. Such a `dividend' may not be possible
in future years in view of falling interest rates.''
   Weinstein, who oversees the program, also abolished on Wednesday
a requirement that applications to the program must have been filed
by March 1, 1989, or 120 days after the veteran dies or is found to
be disabled by exposure to the chemical.
   The judge also ruled that survivor payments can be made to a
veteran's parents, adult children and siblings. Under the previous
guidelines, compensation could be paid only to surviving spouses
and dependent children.
   The Agent Orange Settlement Fund was created by Weinstein in
1984 when seven chemical companies _ without admitting guilt _
agreed to pay $180 million to settle a class-action lawsuit brought
by Vietnam veterans and their families who alleged injuries because
of exposure to the chemical during the war.
   Agent Orange, widely used by American forces during the Vietnam
War, contained the highly toxic chemical dioxin. In their lawsuit,
veterans said exposure to the defoliant caused cancer and other
illnesses, as well as birth defects in their children.

   Massachusetts became the second state to ban
discrimination against homosexuals in housing, credit and
employment, ending a 17-year legislative battle.
   ``We in Massachusetts are again at the forefront of efforts to
extend civil rights protection to all,'' Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
said at a signing ceremony Wednesday.
   Opponents argued the new law establishes special rights for a
small group and promised to try to get it repealed by a statewide
vote next year. But homosexuals said it finally gives them the
protection enjoyed by other minority groups.
   ``This is really proof that the gay and lesbian community can
win in the political and legislative arenas,'' said Arline
Isaacson, co-chair of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political
Caucus.
   More than 80 cities and towns nationwide prohibit discrimination
against homosexuals, but only one other state, Wisconsin, has such
a law, according to gay rights groups.
   During the final day of debate, Republican Sen. Edward Kirby,
who drew scorn from his colleagues for equating gay rights with the
demise of Western civilization, said it provides rights to members
of a group based on their behavior.
   ``Why don't we have an amendment to the bill that protects
members of the Flat Earth Society?'' Kirby said.
   In past years, Senate opponents had bottled the measure up in
committe even after it received initial approval. This year, key
committee posts were changed.
   The bill moved through the final legislative stages last month
when its supporters decided against fighting several Senate
amendments they opposed, opting instead for quick passage.
   The amendments exempt religious institutions and state that
Massachusetts does not endorse homosexuality or recognize
homosexual partnerships.
   In 1979, the state's highest court ruled that the Massachusetts
Commission Against Discrimination could not act on claims based on
sexual orientation unless the Legislature acted to specifically
prohibit such discrimination.
   Now that such action has been taken, MCAD Director Alex
Rodriguez said he expects to handle 300 to 400 claims from
homosexuals each year. The commission can impose fines, and can
require restitution in employment cases.

   The Navy's top brass today defended the
service's safety record and investigation into the explosion aboard
the USS Iowa, but the Navy's top officer acknowledged that the
future of the Iowa and three other battleships may be ``up for
grabs'' because of budget pressures.
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that he stood by the initial findings of his
investigation into the gun-turret explosion that claimed the lives
of 47 sailors aboard the Iowa last April 19.
   Milligan said he remains convinced that one of the victims,
Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig, appeared to be the most likely
person to have set off the blast.
   He said additional technical tests conducted since he issued his
report on Sept. 7 found ``unique foreign material'' on the
projectile from the exploding gun barrel that would not have been
present during a normal firing of the Iowa's huge 16-inch guns.
   ``Now 3{ months later I know of nothing that would cause me to
change my report,'' Milligan said in a statement submitted to the
committee.
   Milligan's boss, Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the chief of naval
operations, said under questioning by committee members that there
was ``no basis whatsoever for retiring the battleships as a
consequence'' of the recent spate of accidents that have hit the
Navy.
   However, Trost acknowledged that ``everything is up for grabs
today as we face a smaller out-year budget.''
   He said the four World War II-era battleships brought out of
mothballs several years ago have made a major contribution to the
nation's combat readiness.
   ``That doesn't say they're guaranteed to stay and they'll take
their shot with everybody else'' in the Pentagon as military
budgets tighten.
   The Washington Post reported in today's editions that placing
the battleships back into monthballs was under consideration.
   Trost issued an unprecedented order on Tuesday that required a
sharp cutback in Navy training and operations in order to conduct a
wide-ranging safety evaluation into the accidents that have plagued
the service this year.
   He told senators he ordered the safety ``stand down'' in order
to discover whether there are ``some things we can or should do
better.''
   ``We aren't running our people into the ground,'' Trost said,
attempting to assure the lawmakers that neither budget cutbacks nor
a high number of operations have caused the string of accidents
over the past months.
   ``There is no central thread,'' Trost said, and preliminary
investigations have shown that some accidents were due to
mechanical failure, acts of God or problems with the performance of
the personnel involved.
   The admiral argued that the Navy's overall safety record has
steadily improved over the past five years with the number of major
accidents running from 118 in 1984 down to 67 in 1989. A major
accident is considered one in which a death or major loss of
equipment occurs.
   Trost said the Navy's duties to fly thousands of airplanes and
run hundreds of ships means that ``there will be mishaps ... Our
goal is to minimize them.''
   The admiral said he was looking for reports at the end of the
safety stand down in order to analyze whether the service could
improve its performance.
   The Navy admirals were greeted by the statements of several
skeptical senators, as well as some supporters, in the hearing room.
   In particular, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., criticized the Navy's
Iowa report as one that ``seems based on supposition and guesswork
rather than fact and physical evidence.''
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, although not a member of the
panel, appeared as a representative from Hartwig's home state and
offered a statement sharply criticizing the Navy's findings.
   ``As a lawyer who formerly practiced law I can say unequivocally
that the Navy has no credible case against Clayton Hartwig,''
Metzenbaum said. ``There is not enough evidence to take to a grand
jury, let alone to get a jury to convict. Barring the introduction
of some new evidence, I believe it's clear that the Navy does not
know what caused the explosion.''
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, voiced similar reservations in an
interview earlier, saying: ``It's a mighty leap of faith for me to
take this information and jump to the conclusion Hartwig is it.''
   In the Milligan report, the Navy said it found Hartwig to be a
``loner'' who had few friends and was upset about the breakup of a
friendship with another sailor.
   The Naval Investigative Service garnered criticism for its part
in the investigation, since its agents queried Hartwig's family and
associates about a possible homosexual relationship after it was
discovered that Hartwig had designated Kendall Truitt, one of the
sailors who survived the blast, as the recipient of his life
insurance policy.
   In its report, however, the Navy said it found no evidence that
Hartwig was a homosexual.
   When the report was issued, Navy officials acknowledged that
their evidence was circumstantial in light of the fact that all the
witnesses, including Hartwig, were killed in the fiery blast.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., chairman of the House Armed
Services subcommittee on investigations, has said he ``seriously
questioned'' the Navy's report, and cited an FBI report that said
its laboratory investigation on the material found in the gun
barrel was inconclusive.
   ``We didn't find anything that would lead us to conclude that a
device was used to prematurely detonate the charge,'' an FBI
spokesman said last month. ``That's not to say something wasn't
there. Our findings were inconclusive.''
   The Senate inquiry was the first public congressional
questioning of Navy officials since the report was issued on Sept.
7.
   The House Armed Services panel is also looking into the
explosion, while the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, is conducting its own inquiry at the request of
Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.

<TEXT>
   While the violence and damage from tornadoes are well known, the
actual mechanics of these storms are complex and not completely
understood.
   They can occur in a variety of situations but are generated most
often in severe thunderstorms that occur when warm air and cold air
collide.
   The collision forces warm air upward, and that creates a low
pressure area at the ground. Surrounding air moves in to fill the
vacuum.
   In severe storms, cloud tops can rise high into the air,
reaching the level of strong horizontal winds that blow the tops
into the classic anvil shape often reported around tornadoes. When
this happens, more air is pulled upward in something like a chimney
effect.
   The air moving in toward the ``chimney'' begins to turn
counterclockwise and then rises in a twisting column of extreme
violence.
   Winds in a tornado are believed to reach more than 200 to 300
mph, although no instruments have ever survived an encounter with
one of the storms.
   Normally tornadoes form in the rear portion of severe storms
which move toward the east or northeast and are separate from the
heavy rains that occur in these storms.

   Taxis have disappeared for lack of gasoline. The local newspaper
Volkswacht complained that some people had bought up to 42 gallons,

<TEXT>
   The great cabbage invasion of 1989 has added a
new leaf to the history of central planning in China.
   The newspaper Beijing Daily declared victory Thursday, saying
the city had successfully withstood the crush of 380,000 tons of
cabbage delivered in the annual November stockpiling of China's
main winter vegetable.
   But the excess supply of cabbage also has been a lesson for
central planners of the difficulty of matching rigid plans to
market demands and tastes.
   The troubles began last year when farmers, turned off by low,
state-set prices, didn't produce enough. Consumers, skittish over
shortages and a 30 percent inflation rate, went on a panic buying
spree.
   City officials, trying to avoid a repeat of that, corraled local
farmers into planting 24,000 acres of cabbage this year, up 4,700
acres from 1988. Their enticements were better prices and
guarantees of pesticides and chemical fertilizers, treasured
commodities for Chinese farmers.
   The result was cabbage chaos.
   Highways leading into the city were clogged with thousands of
trucks laden with farmers who were trying to sell before the first
winter freeze.
   Pedestrians threaded through mazes of cabbage, sometimes stacked
several yards high, piled on almost every streetcorner and spilling
onto streets. Apartment entrances and storefronts were blocked with
mounds of cabbage as the trucks kept pouring in, looking for new
places to dump their produce.
   Thousands of sanitation workers were mobilized to sweep up the
garbage, and even martial law troops, stationed in Beijing since
the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement in June,
pitched in to unload and clean up.
   Demand for cabbage fell. ``It's all over the streets so we can
buy it anytime we want,'' said one hotel worker.
   The official China Daily also pointed out that Beijing youths
were no longer content to eat nothing but cabbage all winter and
were turning instead to potatoes, cucumbers and cauliflower
available from greenhouses.
   Also, although cabbage is still very cheap, the price did go up
about 40 percent this year, to 1.2 cents a pound to help allay the
$8 million in subsidies the city paid out last year to keep retail
prices low.
   By the end of the first week of November, with 80,000 tons of
unsold cabbage on the streets, the government was forced to take
action.
   Mayor Chen Xitong called an emergency meeting Nov. 7 and issued
orders that all public offices, schools, factories and army units
were to stock up on cabbage.
   One worker said his work unit, apparently having bought more
cabbage than it knew what to do with, had given him the 220 pounds
he was lugging home on his bicycle cart. He said his wife had
received another free 220 pounds from her work unit.
   A quota of 66 pounds per person in effect through last year was
lifted and the city vegetable distributing company even promised
home deliveries.
   A foreign student at one university said there are ``heaps and
heaps'' of cabbage around every campus building and the trucks were
still arriving. ``They asked me to buy cabbage too, saying everyone
was buying.''
   By Nov. 11, public institutions had bought 50,000 tons of
cabbage, 20 percent more than original plans, the Beijing Daily
said.
   Beijing citizens spoke sarcastically of ``aiguo baicai,'' _
``patriotic cabbage'' _ a reference to how the government, having
inundated them with the vegetable, was appealing to people's civic
duty to buy more.
   Many people did, although usually not out of a sense of loyalty
to the government. ``Farmers have gone to a lot of hard work and
I'd like to help them out,'' said a 62-year-old doctor who bought
132 pounds for herself and her husband.
   She added that the cabbage was particularly tasty this year and
that ``it's a tradition. Beijing people love cabbage.''

   Three children under age 3 were strangled
or stabbed to death and mutilated with a steak knife, and their
mother was charged with murder, officials said today.
   ``Each child had multiple stab wounds, hundreds of stab
wounds,'' said Dr. J.B. Perdue Jr., Franklin County medical
examiner. He said the children's abdomens had been cut open and
their organs were found strewn about the house. ``It was one of the
worst things I've ever seen, if not the worst,'' he said.
   The mother, Katrina McKay, 20, was charged with three counts of
first-degree murder in the deaths Wednesday evening in her home in
rural Franklinton, northwest of here, said sheriff's department
Capt. Ralph Brown.
   Perdue said Ms. McKay left her children's bodies on a neighbor's
doorstep and was taken into custody after she broke into the man's
home. She was committed to John Umstead Hospital at Butner, a
psychiatric hospital, for observation, he said.
   ``I've been in law enforcement for 20 years in Franklin County
... I would say that this is one of the worst that I've
witnessed,'' said Sheriff Arthur Johnson. ``You wonder if you could
have found out something in advance to prevent this from
happening.''
   The victims were identified as Shenika Chantel McKay, 2, Terrell
Quentin McKay, 1, and Quincey Matthew McKay, 2 months, Perdue said.
   Perdue said electrical cords and clothing had been tied around
the children's necks ``in a strangulating fashion,'' but he did not
know whether it was before they were stabbed.
   A neighbor, George Harris Sr., told authorities Ms. McKay broke
into his home, naked and acting irrationally, and it took him 15
minutes to subdue her, Perdue said. The children's bodies were
found on his back doorstep, tied together with cord, Johnson said.
   ``She was very irrational, and he didn't know what was going on
and wrestled her to the floor,'' Perdue said, adding that Harris,
73, was not injured.
   Ms. McKay was treated at Franklin Regional Medical Center for
superficial stab wounds on her legs and neck before being taken to
the psychiatric hospital. After she was charged, officials said
they planned to transfer her to a psychiatric hospital in Raleigh
that has a prison section.
   Perdue said Ms. McKay, who is apparently unmarried, moved to
Franklin County several months ago.
   ``It was a neat little house,'' Perdue said. ``Of course it was
in disarray. TVs were turned over and there was a lot of trash and
things on the floor like hair rollers. On one of the children she
had used an electric hair curler cord to tie up the child and it
was still dangling from the child.''
   Harris told authorities he didn't know his neighbor personally.
His wife said the woman had borrowed their telephone earlier on the
day of the stabbings and got angry when she couldn't get through to
members of her family, Perdue said.

<TEXT>
   Immigration lawyers say the raging civil
war in El Salvador and political uncertainty in Nicaragua soon will
drive thousands of refugees toward Texas.
   U.S. immigration officials, however, said Wednesday they have no
evidence of an impending exodus from Central America. Southern
Texas is the most common crossing point for Central Americans.
   More than 500 people have died and 1,000 have been wounded in El
Salvador since leftist guerrillas launched an offensive over the
weekend that has crippled the capital, San Salvador.
   Jose Rafael Romero, a Salvadoran seeking asylum in Harlingen,
said he knew of many more countrymen headed north.
   ``I spoke with my family Saturday on the telephone and the
borders were full of people leaving, trying to come here and ask
for political asylum,'' he said.
   Thousands displaced from the intensified fighting will head to
the United States, said Mark Schneider, a lawyer with the Proyecto
Libertad legal aid office for Central Americans here.
   ``The people who are in the middle at this point are going to be
further intimidated and trying to leave,'' Schneider said. ``The
war has come out from underground. This is full-fledged war.''
   Immigration attorney Linda Yanez, in the border city of
Brownsville, said Nicaraguans wary of violence and uncertainty
surrounding the national elections set for February also are
leaving.
   ``A lot of them have been telling me that their families are
packing up and getting ready to leave,'' Ms. Yanez said. ``There's
a lot of uncertainty. I think there's a feeling that they need to
get out before the election.''
   The end of a cease-fire Nov. 1 between the Nicaraguan government
and Contra rebels also could drive people out, she said.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service and Border Patrol
said they had no evidence of large numbers of Central Americans
headed their way.
   Duke Austin, INS spokesman in Washington, said, ``No matter what
happens in Central America, the immigrant rights advocates predict
an increase in immigrants.''
   ``We don't see any buildup as such into Mexico or along the
Mexican border,'' said David Trevino, Border Patrol supervisory
intelligence agent for the sector covering the southernmost tip of
Texas.
   Earlier this year, the INS was seeing hundreds of Central
Americans voluntarily presenting themselves each day to apply for
political asylum. Central Americans pouring across the border
camped in a tent city and in abandoned buildings in the Brownsville
area.
   Then on Feb. 21, the INS began one-day adjudication of asylum
requests in southern Texas. Those denied refugee status are taken
immediately into custody for deportation.
   Since then, the INS in Harlingen as of Wednesday had reviewed
995 voluntary asylum applications. Of those, the INS has approved
168, including 154 Nicaraguans, 11 Salvadorans, two Guatemalans and
one Honduran.
   Asylum is granted to those able to show they are fleeing
persecution.

<TEXT>
   Fire swept through an ammunition depot
in northern Pakistan, killing up to 40 Afghan guerrillas and
wounding scores of others, sources said Thursday.
   The weapons depot belonged to northern Afghanistan's most
powerful guerrilla group, Jamiat-i-Islami.
   Seventeen bodies have been recovered in the wake of the fire,
which began Wednesday and was extinguished Thursday, said a
Pakistan official in the northern Himalayan town of Chitral, 160
miles northwest of Islamabad. He spoke on condition he not be
identified.
   Sources within the Jamiat party said sabotage is suspected,
although no one has claimed responsibility.
   Northern Afghanistan's strongest guerrilla field commander,
Ahmad Shah Masood, was supplied from the depot, located about 33
miles southwest of Chitral, guerrilla sources said.
   During the height of the blaze, rockets rained down on a nearby
refugee camp, he said. There were no reports of deaths or injuries
among the refugees.
   In April 1988, an ammunition dump supplying Afghan guerrillas
exploded outside Islamabad, killing hundreds of people and
showering the area with more than 100,000 rockets, grenades and
artillery projectiles.
   The U.S.-backed anti-communist guerrillas have fought for more
than a decade to topple communist governments in Kabul. Washington
has sent millions of dollars worth of military hardware to rebel
fighters via Pakistan.
   Moscow also arms its Marxist allies in Kabul. The last Red Army
troops left in February after nine years of direct intervention.

   The Senate Judiciary Committee today voted to
recommend confirmation of San Francisco attorney Vaughn Walker as a
federal judge, rejecting claims that he should be disqualified
because he waited too long to resign from a club that refuses to
accept women as members.
   ``I haven't found enough in the record to cause me to vote
against his nomination,'' Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, one of
Walker's critics, said as the panel sent the long-stalled candidacy
to the full Senate by an 11-2 margin.
   The committee also unanimously voted to send to the full Senate
the nomination of President Bush's cousin, District Judge John M.
Walker Jr. of New York, for a U.S. Court of Appeals seat.
   The full Senate is shooting for action on the nominations before
Thanksgiving and a number of others whisked through the committee
without debate.
   The nomination of Vaughn Walker _ no relation to John Walker _
for the District Court in California had been hanging fire for
almost two years and became more deeply embattled in February when
Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., who is not on the Judiciary
Committee, came out against it.
   Vaughn Walker, who had strong backing from Sen. Pete Wilson,
R-Calif., resigned from San Francisco's Olympic Club in a letter
dated Feb. 15, almost a year after former President Reagan
nominated him for the judicial post.
   The club expressly barred blacks from membership until 1968 and
did not admit its first black member until last year. It still does
not accept women as full members, although unmarried daughters and
wives of members may play tennis there and take part in limited
other activities.
   Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy was a member of the club
until shortly before he was nominated for that post. Kennedy had
supported easing restrictions against women maintained by the club.
   Voting against Vaughn Walker, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
told the committee the nominee's resignation and contention that he
had worked to reverse the clu'bs discriminatory policy was
``nothing more than a cynical effort to get himself confirmed.''
Also opposing confirmation was Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.
   Presidential cousin John Walker had been opposed for the appeals
bench by Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz, who said that the
nomination represented a violation of the nation's anti-nepotism
law.
   Dershowitz scoffed at the notion that his opposition stemmed
from friction between himself and John Walker arising out of an old
lawsuit. When the vote came, none of the committee members opposed
the nomination.
   Also getting favorable recommendations from the committee were
six other District Court nominees, Edwin L. Nelson of Alabama, .
Thomas Van Bebber of Kansas, Susan Webber Wright of Arkansas,
Edward W. Nottingham of Colorado, Arthur D. Spatt of New York and
Edward J. Lodge of Idaho.
   Receiving favorable recommendations from the panel were four
candidates for U.S. attorney. They were: Joyce J. George of Ohio,
Jean Paul Bradshaw of Missouri, Timonth D. Leonard of Oklahoma and
Gene W. Shepard of Iowa.
   The committee voted to recommend Cindy Shinga Daub of Nebraska
as a commissioner of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal. She is the
wife of former Rep. Hal Daub, R-Neb.

   Jean Holloway Tobin, a radio, film
and TV scriptwriter whose credits included ``Wagon Train,'' ``Dr.
Kildare'' and ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' has died of a stroke. She was
72.
   Mrs. Tobin, who died Saturday, began writing for radio with
``The Kate Smith Show'' in the late 1930s.
   While still in her 20s, she wrote for such prestigious shows as
``The Hallmark Radio Hall of Fame,'' where she condensed major
contemporary novels into 30 minutes of air time; ``Mr. President,''
where each week Edward Arnold portrayed a different president, and
``Mayor of the Town,'' a melodrama with Lionel Barrymore.
   From 1946 to 1948 she wrote the film musicals ``Till the Clouds
Roll By,'' ``Words and Music'' and ``Summer Holiday,'' an
adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ``Ah Wilderness!''
   After moving to television, where she wrote scripts for such
shows as ``How the West Was Won,'' she met her husband, Dan Tobin,
who played Terrence Clay on ``Perry Mason.'' He died in 1982.
   Her TV writing career extended into the 1970s with the pilot for
``The Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' and other shows.
   She had no immediate survivors.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately known.

   Workers at the Y-12 nuclear weapons plant in
Oak Ridge, Tenn., are not adequately protected from exposure to
radiation, a special federal inspection team said in a report
released Thursday.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins ordered his under secretary,
John Tuck, to prepare a plan for correcting a variety of safety and
environmental problems at Y-12 identified by the inspectors,
including the radiation protection flaws.
   The plant is owned by the Energy Department, but run by a
private contractor, Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc.
   Tuck was ordered to complete the plan, with ``special
attention'' to radiation protection issues, by Friday, according to
an Oct. 27 Watkins memo attached to the inspection report.
   The inspection was performed from Sept. 25 to Oct. 20 by a
special group of private and government experts. They and other
similar groups assembled by Watkins last summer have been assessing
health, safety and environmental issues at many of the department's
nuclear weapons production and assembly facilities.
   The Y-12 plant, built in 1943 as part of the Manhattan Project
that developed the atomic bombs used against Japan in World War II,
employs about 7,000 people making components for nuclear weapons.
It is part of the government-owned Oak Ridge Reservation, a massive
complex about 20 miles west of Knoxville.
   Among the major flaws in the radiation protection system are a
failure of the plant's health physics specialists to routinely
check radiation levels in all areas where significant amounts of
radiation are generated, the report said.
   The report also said radiation survey results often are poorly
documented, and that the plant does not routinely check for flaws
in the warning devices and other safety features of equipment that
generates radiation. For example, such checks are not routinely
done on electron-beam welders, which produce radiation fields
comparable to, and sometimes higher than, X-ray machines, the
report said.
   The report said its inspectors noticed that no health physics
specialists were present to monitor radiation levels when workers
removed an air filter from the roof of a building, ``despite the
potential for spreading contamination on the roof and also for an
unmonitored release of airborne radiation.''
   Also, the report said ``safety work permits'' prepared for
employees at Y-12 were ``not an effective means of informing
workers of the radiological conditions that may be encountered at
the job site.''
   The report said Martin Marietta was aware of the shortcomings
and was working to correct them.
   The inspectors praised Martin Marietta managers' commitment to
health and safety goals, and said the plant's operations were
basically sound. However, the team found numerous potential
violations of federal and state environmental regulations,
including discharges of waste into East Fork Poplar Creek.
   The report said that while the environmental problems needed to
be corrected, ``none were of a nature that indicated undue risk to
public health or the environment with continued operation of the
Y-12 plant.''

<HEAD>Study: No One is Too Old for Coronary Bypass</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Coronary bypass can help victims of heart
disease live better and longer even after they reach their 80s, and
no one should be denied the operation simply because of age, says a
study released Thursday.
   However, doctors cautioned that this common form of surgery
should be limited to folks who are healthy and independent except
for serious chest pain.
   ``All 80-year-olds are not created equal,'' said Dr. Gail E.
Darling. ``People with a lot of other illnesses are not considered
good candidates for bypass.''
   But if the patient is otherwise in good shape, she said, ``age
alone should not be a factor in the decision to proceed with
coronary bypass surgery.''
   Darling, a heart surgeon, based her recommendation on a review
of 159 octogenarians who underwent bypass surgery in the past 12
years at the Mayo Clinic. She presented her findings at the annual
scientific meeting of the American Heart Association.
   Before the operations, 97 percent of the patients had severe,
disabling chest pain that occurred while resting or during such
simple activities as cooking or walking. Afterward, most felt
dramatic relief from their symptoms and could lead more active
lives.
   An estimated 284,000 bypass operations were performed in the
United States in 1986. Darling said that while the surgery has
become relatively common for people in their 70s, many doctors are
still reluctant to perform it on older folks.
   The operation typically costs between $20,000 and $30,000. Some
have questioned whether it makes economic sense for the very old.
   ``Considering the skyrocketing cost of medical care, it will
become more and more of a philosophical issue,'' said Dr. Kent W.
Jones of the University of Utah. ``When do people get so old that
we say enough is enough?''
   The main drawback to the surgery was a relatively high death
rate of 11 percent. However, if they survived long enough to be
discharged from the hospital, the patients did relatively well.
   Overall, 84 percent of those undergoing surgery survived at
least one year, and 70 percent were still alive after five years.
   Darling said this was as good as typical survival for people
that age and better than what would be expected for those with
serious heart disease.
   Between 1977 and 1983, less than one-half of 1 percent of all
bypass patients at the Mayo Clinic were over 80. Since then, this
has grown to about 3 percent.
   The patients suffered pain because the arteries that carry blood
to their hearts had become clogged. During the operations, surgeons
used pieces of blood vessel to detour blood around the blockages,
restoring free flow to the heart.

   Six Jesuits priests were
tortured and killed today at a leading Roman Catholic university,
and a priest said uniformed soldiers were seen entering the
priests' residence before the shooting began.
   The government and armed forces denied that any troops were
involved in the massacre, which occurred during the sixth day of
fierce fighting between leftist guerrillas and soldiers of the
rightist government.
   The dead included the rector and vice-rector of Simeon Canas
Central American University. The cook and her 15-year-old daughter
who worked at the home also were slain.
   ``They were assassinated with lavish babarity. For example, they
took out their brains,'' said the Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the
Jesuit Provincial for Central America. He said the victims were
tortured before they were slain.
   The priests were killed, their faces disfigured and their brains
removed from their skulls at the home they shared at the
university, one of Central America's most prestigious insitutions
of higher learning.
   ``If this spiral of violence continues, death and destruction
will sweep away many, especially those who are of most use to our
people,'' San Salvador's Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas said after
leading a prayer over the mutilated bodies.
   A Jesuit priest who spoke on condition of anonymity told
journalists at the site that a witness saw about 30 uniformed
soldiers enter the university grounds and the priests' residence
shortly before the shots rang out.
   ``There have been soldiers posted at the gate since Sunday. The
murders were committed in the middle of a curfew. The same house
where they were killed was raided and searched by soldiers on
Tuesday,'' said the priest.
   The massacre took place during heavy fighting in San Salvador,
where guerrillas of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front were trying to hold on to positions they seized on Saturday.
   The armed forces and government rejected the accusation that
troops were involved in the killings. In a communique the National
Information Center, termed the slayings ``savage and irrational.''
   It said the crime ``is intended to destablize the democratic
process and increase even more the climate of anguish created by
the FMLN (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front).''
   The communique said an investigation into the slayings has begun.
   Eduardo Valdez, Director of Jesuit Studies, said the Jesuits had
received many anonymous threats in past days and that a rightist
death squad was probably responsible for the killings. The extreme
right has for more than a decade accused the Jesuit order and its
university of fostering subversive leftist ideology.
   Tojeira identified the victims as Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of
the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University; Ignacio
Martin-Baro, the vice rector; and educators Segundo Montes, Amando
Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez Lopez.
   The home of the Jesuits is located behind the university campus,
on the southwest side of the capital, where there has been fighting
between guerrillas and government troops. The bulk of the fighting,
however, was on the east and north sides and part of the west-side
of the city.
   One priest at the university, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said he and other neighbors mistook the shooting at the
Jesuits' home as part of the fighting. Reporters who saw the
victims at the house said their bodies were riddled with bullets,
some of them fired at the heads.
   All but Lopez Lopez, a native Salvadoran, were Spanish by birth
and naturalized Salvadorans.
   The university is one of the most highly regarded institutions
of higher learning in Central America.
   The slain servant was identified as Julia Elba Ramos. He
15-year-old daughter, Celina, was also killed, said Tojeira.
   ``They did not want to leave witnesses,'' said Valdez.

   The Palestinian group run by terror
mastermind Abu Nidal has been split by a bloody feud that has
killed at least 200 members, senior PLO officials say.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said more
than 300 of Abu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council have fled in
fear from his main base in Libya to Algeria, Tunisia and Lebanon.
   Those who fled and many of those killed are believed to be
dissidents upset with Abu Nidal's management of the organization
and the direction of the group. The dissidents hiding out in
Algiers include some of Abu Nidal's closest former aides, including
Atef Abu Bakr, his spokesman since 1986; and Abdul-Rahman Issa, a
member of the 10-man politburo that ran Fatah-Revolutionary
Council, the sources said in interviews.
   Most of the killings occurred in Lebanon, where Abu Nidal
loyalists have killed 152 of their adversaries this year.
   Twenty other dissidents were gunned down in Palestinian refugee
camps in Syria, the PLO officials said.
   Twenty-two of the group's leading figures were gunned down at
Abu Nidal's home in a compound used as a training base on the
outskirts of Tripoli, the Libyan capital, the sources reported.
   Abu Nidal's real name is Sabri al-Banna. He split with Yasser
Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in the early 1970s. His
group is not part of the PLO.
   In 1985 and 1986, Abu Nidal's gunmen carried out at least 12
attacks around the world, killing 115 people and wounding 500.
These included the November 1985 hijacking of an Egyptian airliner
to Malta in which 59 people were killed.
   The group is responsible for the Rome and Vienna airport
massacres of Dec. 27, 1985, that killed 20 people.
   His guerrillas also were held responsible for commandeering a
Pan Am jet on Sept. 5 at the airport in Karachi, Pakistan. The
terrorists opened fire inside the aircraft, killing 20 people.
   Among the Abu Nidal members killed in the feud were politburo
members slain in Libya late last year and buried in the backyard of
Abu Nidal's home by bodyguards who poured tons of cement over the
bodies, the sources said.
   They included Mustafa Murad, who used the codename Abu Nizar and
had been Abu Nidal's right-hand man since 1973; and Haj Abu Mousa,
the group's chief instructor.
   Abu Mousa was popular among Fatah-Revolutionary Council's young
recruits and his assassination apparently prompted most of the
defections, the sources said.
   The PLO officials said the trouble began in October 1987, when
some Fatah-Revolutionary Council guerrillas mutinied.
   The officials quoted dissidents as saying ``an air of
disappointment'' prevailed among Abu Nidal's men in Lebanon after
he allied with the Iranians and the Tehran-backed Shiite Moslem
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God, in 1985.
   ``No explanation was offered as to how a Communist, supposedly
committed to Maoism, found common ground for an alliance with
Moslem fundamentalists,'' one official said.
   They cited ``financial corruption, internal differences and
regional alliances'' as the main cause of the mutiny.
   ``He's tried in vain in recent months to reorganize the group,
recruit new members from the Syrian and Libyan intelligence
services. But no one wants to follow a loser,'' a Palestinian
official said from Tunis.
   Abu Nidal, 52, has dissolved Fatah-Revolutionary Council's
politburo and assumed full control of the movement, appointing
Majed Atta, his niece's husband, as his deputy, the sources said.

<HEAD>Poll Indicates Gandhi's Party to Lose Election Over Corruption Issue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress
Party is likely to lose its governing majority in elections next
week because of corruption allegations, according to opinion poll
results released Thursday.
   The poll, conducted for Sunday magazine, indicates Gandhi's
party will win only 180 to 215 seats in the 542-member Parliament,
a steep fall from the 415 seats it won in 1984.
   ``The Indian voter is angry, disillusioned and cynical. Most of
that resentment will probably find its way to the polling booth in
the form of a vote against Congress (Party),'' the weekly magazine
said in a preview Thursday. Full results are to be released
Saturday.
   The party is contesting 509 seats in the Nov. 22, 24 and 26
elections that poll analysts say will be the toughest for the party
since 1977 when it lost for the only time since independence from
Britain in 1947.
   At that time, the opposition had united. It soon splintered due
to internal squabbles and the Congress came back to power in the
1980 elections.
   This year, major opposition parties again united to form a
coalition led by Vishwanath Pratap Singh, who resigned in 1987 as
Gandhi's defense minister.
   However, Sunday magazine said its poll showed ``it is the
negative vote that will decide this election,'' the ninth since
India gained independence.
   Although the voter does not perceive opposition politicians also
as honest, anger at government corruption will result in negative
vote, said the poll, which questioned 11,500 voters in 38
constituencies.
   A Congress Party spokesman, Anand Sharma, dismissed the results.
   ``In the 1984 elections the same magazine said the Congress
(Party) will win 250 seats,'' Sharma said. ``If they were that wide
off the mark, then they have not shown any substantial
improvement.''
   The 1984 polls were conducted by a different agency.
   More than half the voters asked in northern and western India
believed that corruption has increased since Gandhi came to power
in 1984, the latest poll found. These concerns were nationwide, but
voters in the south were less concerned about corruption.
   ``An alarmingly large proportion of respondents believe that the
prime minister is personally corrupt,'' said the poll, which the
magazine said was largest of its kind ever conducted in India.
   Gandhi has been dogged since April 1987 by allegations that
members of his party and senior government officials received as
much as $50 million in kickbacks in a $1.4 billion gun contract
with a Swedish company, AB Bofors.
   Gandhi, repeatedly denying the charge, has also said no Indian
received commissions or kickbacks from Bofors. But the issue has
been seized upon by the opposition as its main campaign platform.
   Gandhi's landslide victory in December 1984 was attributed to
the sympathy wave generated by the assassination two months earlier
of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, his mother.
   The last poll was published in August by the newsmagazine India
Today. That poll predicted the Congress Party would win 314 seats _
but only if the opposition parties failed to unite. It said a
united opposition could cut the Congress Party's seats to 244, less
than half the seats in Parliament.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of Massachusetts' gay rights law
launched a repeal campaign Thursday one day after Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis signed the measure.
   A coalition filed petitions with the secretary of state's office
seeking a referendum on the law, which bans discrimination against
homosexuals in housing, employment and credit. Massachusetts is the
second state to enact such a law.
   ``We intend to blow this bill to smithereens,'' said the Rev.
Earl W. Jackson. ``We intend to defeat this legislation and bury it
so deep no one will ever find it again.''
   Nancy Sutton, chairman of Citizens for Families First, the group
leading the repeal movement, said, ``When this question has been
taken to the people for a vote anywhere in the nation, people
clearly reject it.''
   ``Protecting and thereby encouraging behavior that is contrary
to traditional family life is harmful to every member of society,''
she said.
   Sutton filed petitions bearing 10 signatures, including those of
former Gov. John Volpe, former Boston Mayor John Collins, state
Sen. Edward Kirby, a Republican, to start the referendum campaign.
To get the repeal question on the 1990 ballot, gay-rights opponents
must collect 25,263 signatures.
   Before Massachusetts, Wisconsin was the only state with a
gay-rights law.
   Kirby, who led the fight in the state Senate against the bill,
said, ``It is giving special privileges to a group who chose to
belong to it. Now this will go to the people. The people have a
right to be heard on this issue.''
   Arline Isaacson, co-chair of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian
Political Caucus, said of the repeal effort: ``I'm disappointed and
I'm frustrated, but more than that I am appalled. This bill gives
us equal protection under the law.''
   ``This doesn't mean people have to like gays or approve of our
lifestyle,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers crawled through collapsed homes
and shops today looking for more victims of a tornado that carved a
3-mile stretch of destruction, killing 17 people, injuring 463 and
leaving 1,000 homeless.
   ``It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a
blender and putting it on liquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob
Caraway, whose specialty is cave rescues. He was among those called
out to help dig through rubble for survivors or the bodies of the
dead.
   The tornado was one of a series that touched down Wednesday in
an arc spanning at least seven states from the Deep South to the
Midwest. The other tornadoes caused at least 19 injuries and
far-flung property damage.
   In Huntsville, teams with cranes and floodlights searched for
the injured or dead, hampered by wind-whipped rain and temperatures
that plummeted overnight from 73 degrees into the 30s.
   Gov. Guy Hunt sent 50 National Guardsmen to help and said he
would view damage Friday. His spokesman, Terry Abbott, said aerial
surveys indicate the twister hopped along a 25-mile path, much of
it straight through Huntsville.
   By this afternoon, severe thunderstorms were crossing the
Northeast. The National Weather Service put out a tornado watch for
parts of Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York,
all of Connecticut and Rhode Island, and parts of Massachusetts,
Vermont and New Hampshire.
   In Pennsylvania, the weather service said it received
unconfirmed reports of a tornado that turned over a car and knocked
down trees and power lines near Gettysburg.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Georgia, 19 people were injured, four critically, and at
least 200 people were evacuated after a tornado strus.C., and a tornado
toppled trees, downed
power lines and damaged 20 houses near Greenwood, S.C. No injuries
were reported in either state.
   _Tornadoes caused minor property damage in Mississippi, Kentucky
and Indiana.
   _In West Virginia, high winds believed to be tornadoes swept
Jefferson County early today, overturning trailers, blowing roofs
off homes and downing power lines, authorities said. Four people
were injured, two seriously.
   _Heavy thunderstorms destroyed at least a dozen homes in
Alorton, Ill., killing one person and injuring 20 others, five
seriously, authorities said.
   The tornado struck Huntsville with virtually no warning
Wednesday afternoon as the city's streets grew busy with the
approach of rush hour. In a matter of seconds, cars were hurled
through the air and crushed, and apartments and stores looked as if
they had been bombed.
   ``It was fast,'' said Lucy Lee Rusk, whose apartment was
battered by debris. ``It was like one big pop and that's when
everything went.''
   The National Weather Service had issued a tornado watch earlier
in the day, but did not issue a more urgent tornado warning until
4:39 p.m. CST, when the tornado was spotted at the municipal golf
course. By then, it was already tearing up the city.
   A watch means a tornado is considered possible, while a warning
means a tornado is believed to exist.
   Huntsville Police Maj. Robert Moder said this morning that 463
people were injured by the twister, which plowed through a school
and rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.
   Police Chief Richard Ottman initially put the number of dead at
19, but his clerk, Kitty Whitworth, later said the death toll was
lowered to 17 after police confirmed the count of bodies. She said
police had no firm reports of people missing.
   No children in the school were killed, but about 30 youngsters
were in a kindergarten class at the building, and five were
reported injured. Most of the dead were in apartments, stores or
cars.
   Mayor Steve Hettinger estimated the number of homeless at 1,000
and said officials were preparing a request for federal disaster
assistance.
   A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said
42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood of
the survivors as ``shock, mostly, and disbelief.''
   ``They're thankful to be alive and they're thankful their
families are alive,'' he said, adding that the shelter had received
calls from around the country from worried relatives.
   The tornado was Alabama's deadliest since a 1975 twister killed
22 people in Birmingham, said Danny Cooper, state emergency
management director in Montgomery.
   Along a highway near a destroyed apartment complex, cars were
flipped and smashed into telephone poles and crushed by trees. The
roadway was strewn with used bandages and medical gloves left by
emergency workers treating the injured.
   Humana Hospital administrator David Miller said doctors had
difficulty reaching the hospital because of blocked roads.
   Those in the tornado's path spoke with awe of its fury.
   ``It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and
it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold
of,'' said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car.
   Heavy overhead power lines ``started snapping just like a circus
performer would snap his whip,'' Carroll said. ``All of these heavy
arcing, flashing lines that were just popping and snapping over the
top of us. ... It was as if you were looking into an arc-welder,
they were so bright.''
   Kenneth Lenhard had undergone an operation at the Crestwood
Hospital on Wednesday and returned to his room about an hour before
a window in the next room blew out as the tornado passed.
   ``There wasn't anything I could do, so I covered my head,''
Lenhard said. ``I thought, `What the heck, I'm already half dead.'
''
   The downtown Jones Valley Elementary School, the Waterford
Square and adjacent Queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to
rubble.
   Kindergarteners were the only pupils left at the school by the
time the twister hit.
   The city is home to NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center and the
Army's Redstone Arsenal, but no serious damage was reported from
the space agency or weapons testing center.
   At least two other tornadoes were reported in Alabama, injuring
at least three people in addition to the Huntsville total.
   Near Palmetto, Ga., resident Jeff Bryant said his home at the
Sweetbriar Mobile Home Park near Interstate 85 began to vibrate
when the twister approached.
   ``Then we heard a large, loud, swirling and humming noise,'' he
recalled. ``It didn't sound like a train like everybody says it
does. I lived near a train track. It did not sound like a train. It
sounded more like a jet aircraft at very close range.''
   Thomas Farr was driving on Interstate 85 when the tornado hit.
``It was picking up cars and tossing them like toys off the
interstate,'' he said. ``I saw one 18-wheeler flip over. The car in
front of us was flipped about 100 yards, and the guy was thrown out
of his passenger window and landed 50 feet from his car.

   Debbye Turner says her biggest surprise
after becoming Miss America was how little it changed her.
   ``I always had this image of Miss America being superhuman,''
she said. ``She was bigger than life and perfect, ... But what I
found is I'm still just Debbye. Being Debbye was enough to win the
title and has been enough to carry the title.''
   Miss Turner, 24, returned to Jonesboro, where she grew up, for a
two-day celebration that ended Thursday.
   The events in Jonesboro marked Miss Turner's second homecoming
since her crowning two months ago. Last month, she was honored in
her adopted town of Mexico, Mo., where she lived while attending
the University of Missouri-Columbia Veterinary School of Medicine.
   Although she entered the Miss America pageant as Miss Missouri,
Miss Turner said Wednesday that Jonesboro is home.
   ``This is going to sound really corny to say, but to this point
the most exciting thing ... is coming home,'' Miss Turner said
Wednesday.

   Filmmaker Roger Corman, who was quick to
start work on ``The War of the Satellites'' following the 1957
Soviet launch of Sputnik, is ready to dramatize headlines again
with a Berlin-based movie.
   The movie, titled ``The Day The Wall Came Down,'' won't be a
documentary of the recent East German reforms that included opening
the wall separating the two Berlins, Corman said Tuesday.
   ``I didn't want to do a totally political story,'' he said. ``So
I wrote over the weekend an outline of an espionage thriller laid
against the tearing down of the wall.''
   Corman, who started work on the 1957 drama one day after the
Soviet satellite was launched, said he has already shown the script
idea to Bavarian Film Studios and won tentative approval to start
shooting in Germany by springtime.

Thursday won the Cervantes Prize, popularly known as the Nobel for
literature in the Spanish language.
   The 72-year-old author is best known for his 1974 historical
novel ``I, The Chief,'' about the 19th century Paraguayan dictator
Jose Gaspar Rodriguez de Francia.
   The prize, awarded by the Ministry of Culture for the work of a
lifetime, carries a $86,200 prize. It is named after 16th century
Spanish writer Miguel de Cervantes, author of ``Don Quixote'' and
considered by many to be the father of the novel.
   Spanish sociologist Juan Marichal, a member of the jury, said
Roa Bastos was picked for the high quality of his writing and also
because he wrote most of his works in exile.
   The author makes his home in Toulouse, France, where he taught
at the university before his retirement. During a civil war in
Paraguay in 1947, he was forced into exile to Buenos Aires. He
returned to Paraguay in 1970 but left soon afterward to live in
Europe.

   Moldavia's Communist Party chief was removed
Thursday after activists criticized him for slowing reforms in his
republic, wracked by ethnically motivated strikes, clashes and
demonstrations.
   The republic's policy-making Central Committee relieved Semyon
K. Grossu as its first secretary because of a transfer to another
job, Tass said. It did not identify his new post, but the director
of the republic's official news agency said Grossu would work in
Moscow in a yet-to-be determined job.
   Grossu's replacement is Pytor Luchinsky, 49, who has been
serving as the second highest party official in the republic of
Tadzhikistan, Tass reported. Like Grossu, Luchinsky is an ethnic
Moldavian.
   Moldavia is one of the many ethnic trouble spots in the Soviet
Union where the population is clamoring for more control over its
culture, economy and politics, and is running into opposition from
ethnic minorities led by Russians.
   The Tass report did not hint the Moldavian party was unhappy
with Grossu, but activists on Sunday began circulating a petition
demanding removal of conservatives among the republic's top
officials.
   Grossu and three of his deputies were on the list because he was
an ``inactive arch-conservative'' blamed for economic, ecological
and political problems, said Konstantin Bogdanash, a spokesman for
the grassroots group People's Front that organized the petition
drive.
   The People's Front began the campaign after a Nov. 10 brawl
between police and protesters that left almost 200 people injured.
The demonstrators were demanding the release of 20 people arrested
three days earlier while trying to stage another protest.
   Activist Pyotor Shornikov, a leader of a group representing
ethnic minorities in Moldavia, has called the southwestern republic
once ruled by Leonid I. Brezhnev ``one of the epicenters of
stagnation,'' and Grossu has become a target of growing criticism.
   Asked why Grossu was removed, Fyodr A. Angeli, the director of
ATEM, Moldavia's news agency, said by telephone from the Moldavian
capital of Kishinev that the step was ``logical'' after the events
of Nov. 7 and 10. But he added Grossu had been talking for at least
a half-year about stepping down.
   Grossu, 55, headed the Moldavian Communist Party since 1980 and
came under increasing pressure from nationalist activists to
reverse decades of ``Russification'' of the southwestern republic
on the border with Romania. In the past year, Moldavian officials
agreed to measures aimed at preserving the Moldavian language and
ethnic rights of the indigenous population.
   But strikes and demonstrations became common as ethnic
Moldavians and ethnic minorities living in the republic led by
Russians traded charges of discrimination. Of the republic's 4.2
million people, 64 percent are Moldavians, with the rest Russians,
Ukrainians, Bulgarians, Jews and Christian Turks.
   Grossu appeared on the national TV newscast ``Vremya'' on
Wednesday saying a package of economic reforms, including spending
more money on food and consumer goods supplies and the social and
cultural spheres, ``should help ease the tension in our republic.''
   Bogdanash, also speaking by telephone from Kishinev, predicted
Moldavians would welcome Luchinsky's election because he is
respected as ``cultured, politically experienced, energetic and
intelligent.'' Before moving to Tadzhikistan, Luchinsky worked as
the No. 2 party official in Moldavia.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Communist Party chiefs
have been replaced in many of the ethnically troubled republics, in
many cases with more liberal officials. These include Estonia,
Lithuania, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and the
Ukraine.

<TEXT>
   Government forces attacked
rebel positions today in the fiercest combat of the 5-day-old
battle of San Salvador. Six priests were tortured and killed in a
massacre at a Roman Catholic school.
   One church leader said the brutal slayings were probably the
work of rightist death squads. But a priest at the scene said
uniformed soldiers were spotted entering the priests' residence
before the shooting began.
   The government and armed forces denied that any troops were
involved.
   Nearly 700 people have died in the fighting in and around San
Salvador.
   The resounding boom of army mortars and reports from assault
rifles echoed across the capital, with fire from the Zacamil
neighborhood on the northern edge almost continuous from shortly
before 4 a.m. until dawn.
   Red tracer bullets and orange flares dropped by circling
helicopters lighted the night sky.
   Light tanks were seen heading toward the embattled district.
   A-37 fighter-bombers screamed low over the city in several runs
westward, presumably toward rebel positions near the western suburb
of Merliot, where fighting was heavy Wednesday night.
   Deafening explosions following the swoops gave the impression
the planes were dropping 250-pound or 500-pound bombs on insurgents
concentrated on the lower slopes of the San Salvador volcano.
   The six Jesuit priests were slain at about 3 a.m., their faces
disfigured and their brains removed from their skulls at the home
they shared on adjoining the grounds of Jose Simeon Canas Central
American University, one of the region's most prestigious
insitutions of higher learning. The victims were tortured, then
shot to death, officials said.
   ``If this spiral of violence continues, death and destruction
will sweep away many, especially those who are of most use to our
people,'' San Salvador's Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas said after
leading a prayer over the mutilated bodies.
   Eduardo Valdez, Director of Jesuit Studies, said the Jesuits had
received many anonymous threats in past days and that a rightist
death squad was probably responsible for the killings. The extreme
right has for more than a decade accused the Jesuit order and its
university of fostering subversive leftist ideology.
   A Jesuit priest who spoke on condition of anonymity told
journalists at the site of the massacre that a witness saw about 30
uniformed soldiers enter the university grounds and the priests'
residence shortly before the shots rang out.
   ``There have been soldiers posted at the gate since Sunday. The
murders were committed in the middle of a curfew. The same house
where they were killed was raided and searched by soldiers on
Tuesday,'' said the priest.
   The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, the Jesuit Provincial for Central
America, identified the slain priests as Ignacio Ellacuria, the
university rector; Ignacio Martin-Baro, the vice-rector; Segundo
Montes, Amando Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez Lopez.
   Tojeira said their domestic servant and her daughter were also
killed.
   ``They did not want to leave witnesses,'' said Valdez.
   A dusk-to-dawn curfew prevented travel to the combat zones until
daybreak, and it was not immediately clear if the sustained fire
was causing heavy casualties.
   The rebels had fortified positions in several six-story
low-income apartment blocks in Zacamil. Most civilians had
evacuated the buildings by late Wednesday, but scores remained in
the dwellings.
   As of Wednesday night, More than 680 soldiers, rebels and
civilians had been killed and another 1,600 wounded in the pitched
fighting, according to hospital, morgue and government sources.
   Among them, at least 100 civilians have been killed and 800
injured, the sources said. The fighting has been concentrated in
densely populated working-class districts on the capital's
outskirts.
   On Wednesday, government troops drove insurgents from some
outlying capital districts, but rebels repelled repeated army
assaults in others.
   Though the government held an advantage in numbers and weaponry,
many rebel units held their ground in fierce fighting while others,
forced into retreat, regrouped to strike again.
   Since the offensive began Saturday, government troops have
apparently not shelled or bombed rebel positions, likely for fear
of inflicting high civilian casualties.
   The government of rightist President Alfredo Cristiani has
accused the guerrillas of shielding themselves behind civilians.
   But that has not stopped government soldiers from rocketing and
strafing rebel strongholds from helicopters and airplanes, damaging
and wrecking thousands of homes in the city's northern reaches.
   Many civilians in neighborhoods held by guerrillas have been
caught in the crossfire as government forces have raked rebel
positions with large caliber machine-gun fire or rocketed from
aloft.
   The U.S. Embassy said the dead include 146 soldiers and 434
guerrillas, while 362 soldiers and 457 rebels have been wounded.
   The government, which on Sunday decreed a state of siege
suspending most constitutional guarantees, tightened limits on
freedom of expression Wednesday with a directive sent to all local
media.
   Salvadoran media are prohibited from publishing any communiques
issued by the rebels or by any group that circulates word on rebel
activities.
   The rebels claimed to hold about a quarter of the country and
radio correspondents in the countryside said fighting continued
Wednesday in and around the provincial capitals of San Miguel,
Santa Ana and Zacatecoluca.
   In the capital, several hundred rebels, including two top
commanders, were dug in Wednesday at the northern district of
Mejicanos.
   The scene there differed from that in Zacamil and Soyapango _
other guerrilla strongholds in recent days _ in that most Mejicanos
residents have stayed on in their homes and many appear aligned
with the rebels.
   In some neighborhoods, residents could be seen feeding and
giving other assistance to rebel fighters.
   The rebels say they mounted the offensive, their largest since
1981, largely in response to a series of attacks on leftist
civilian leaders that included the bombing of a union hall Oct. 31
that claimed 10 lives.
   Many leaders of union, peasant and student organizations
considered guerrilla fronts by the government have gone underground
this week.
   The 10-year-old civil war between the rebel front and a
succession of U.S.-backed governments has claimed the lives of
about 70,000 people, most of them civilians.

   Wine lovers uncorking the 1989 Beaujolais nouveau
on Thursday nearly unanimously agreed the pricey wine heralds great
promise for other French wine-producing regions.
   Sophisticated and pedestrian palates confirmed predictions by
promoters that the fruity young wine _ the first released since the
autumn grape harvest _ ranks as the best in decades.
   ``You never know how good a wine is going to be until you drink
it,'' lawyer Yves Milon said at a party celebrating the ritual
opening of the first bottles of the new wine on the third Thursday
of November. ``Now that I've tasted it, I know.''
   ``If all the '89 wines are this good, it's going to be a great
year,'' he said.
   Robert Cointepas, owner of the Taverne Henri IV near Notre Dame
Cathedral, detailed his satisfaction with the wine's clarity, color
and bouquet as shouts of ``Vive le nouveau!'' rang out from
indulgent tipplers packed into his celebrated wine bar.
   John Powell, 26, of Palo Alto, Calif., had a somewhat more basic
measure of quality: ``If I'm still standing in five hours, that'll
tell you how good it is.''
   A consumption embargo on the wine was lifted at midnight
Wednesday, but most Parisians held off serious drinking until the
early morning. At lunchtime Thursday, dozens of parties sprang up
throughout the capital.
   Promoters called the 1989 stock the best in a quarter-century.
   ``This is an exceptional year for Beaujolais and all the
vintages in France,'' said Michel Deflache of the Union
Interprofessionnelle des Vins du Beaujolais, the producers
association.
   Wine drinkers around the world await the beverage each November
arriving by plane, train, truck and ship in a massive public
relations campaign.
   Hundreds of Japanese raced to Tokyo's international airport
Wednesday night to get a first taste of the wine at midnight, eight
hours before the wine was allowed to be uncorked in France.
   The marketing by Deflache's organization has boosted the
little-known first-press wine to world fame in two decades while
critics and admirers continue to debate the wine's real merits.
   ``Twenty years ago, this wine was nothing and it's still
nothing,'' declared Jacques Constant at the Bar St. Philippe in the
fashionable Faubourg St. Honore shopping district. ``The real
French wines are the Bordeaux and Bourgogne.''
   Bar owner Rene Bourel vigorously disagreed. ``I prefer the
Beaujolais to the Bordeaux. Why? It's like a blonde woman or a
brunette, a matter of taste.''
   A long dry summer and early rain-free harvest have led to
expectations that this year's French wines could rank among the
best this century.
   As the first wines of the year, the Beaujolais nouveau, normally
considered an inexpensive lightweight, served as a bellwether to
both quality and the price the market will bear.
   Wholesale Beaujolais nouveau rose as much as 30 percent this
year, Deflache said, retailing for an average of $4 per bottle in
Paris and nearly $17 in Tokyo.
   About half of this year's production of 4.4 million cases went
to foreign markets, principally West Germany, Britain, Belgium, the
United States and Japan.
   The Japanese market remains the fastest-growing, Deflache said,
with demand jumping from 300,000 cases in 1988 to 440,000 cases
this year. The U.S. market represents an equivalent number of sales.

   Congressional supporters of expanded federal
financing of abortions are conceding defeat for this year but say
they'll renew their fight next year, aided by growing political
pressures.
   ``This is not the last inning, not by any means,'' said Rep. Les
AuCoin, D-Ore., a leader of the abortion-rights lawmakers. ``We
still have next year, and if that doesn't work out, we have next
November's elections.''
   The House on Wednesday approved an appropriations bill for
health and other programs that includes abortion language _
demanded by President Bush _ that continues the ban on federally
funded abortions for poor women except when the life of the mother
is in danger.
   Bush vetoed a previous version of the bill last month because it
would have permitted federally financed Medicaid abortions for poor
women who are victims of rape or incest.
   The Senate approved the bill today, after adding a series of
unrelated amendments, including one providing penalties for
providing ``dial-a-porn'' obscene telephone communications to
minors. The bill now goes back to the House for concurrence.
   The Senate passed the appropriations bill on a voice vote and
with virtually no mention of the abortion issue. Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., noted that the House had failed to sustain Bush's
veto of the abortion provision.
   ``That is the conclusion of that issue,'' Specter said. ``The
time has come for us to move ahead. ... The time for talk has
ended.''
   Although the rape-and-incest provision covers a relatively small
number of additional abortions, by most estimates, the issue became
a symbolic battleground in the political struggle over abortion.
That struggle has taken on increased intensity since the Supreme
Court last summer gave states more leeway to regulate abortions,
and proponents of abortion rights won key elections last week in
Virginia and New Jersey.
   Last month's House vote was the first time in a decade it had
backed the more liberal abortion provisions, which the Senate also
approved. But the House failed by 51 votes to override Bush's veto.
   AuCoin said abortion-rights supporters believe political
pressure will build as a result of Bush's veto and increased public
attention on the abortion issue.
   They rejected what they described as compromise efforts by
anti-abortion lawmakers to permit financing of abortions for rape
and incest victims who report the crimes within a time limit, such
as 72 hours. AuCoin said that would be a ``bogus compromise''
providing political cover to lawmakers who voted to sustain Bush's
veto.
   The House approved the bill on a voice vote after an emotional
and sometimes bitter revival of the debate over abortion.
Anti-abortion forces did not attempt to amend or defeat the measure.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has led the fight for abortion
restrictions, took strong exception to AuCoin's reference to Hyde's
side as being ``anti-choice,'' and hurled stronger words back.
   ``The pro-killer crowd _ the death squads of the left,'' Hyde
said. ``We can play that game too.''
   The disputed abortion provision is part of a $157 billion
appropriations bill for labor, education and health programs for
the 1990 fiscal year.
   The House and Senate both approved another appropriations bill
for the District of Columbia, which Bush similarly vetoed because
of abortion. The new version, approved 229-191, prohibits the use
of federal money for D.C.-funded abortions except when the mother's
life is endangered, but would let the district government use local
funds for abortions.
   Anti-abortion forces said the House action on the D.C. bill
could invite another Bush veto.
   At the same time, the administation suffered at least a
temporary setback in the Senate, which voted 52-44 to insist on a
provision in a foreign aid spending bill that would send $15
million to the United Nations Population Fund.
   Abortion opponents want to delete the money because the U.N.
agency operates in China, which has restrictive limits on family
size and allegedly imposes forced abortions and sterilizations on
women. The Senate vote sent the bill back to the House, which voted
a day earlier to give Bush the final decision on whether o fund the
U.N. agency.

   The House voted today to raise members'
salaries by more than a third and to tighten ethics rules which
allow lawmakers to earn much of their income elsewhere.
   The bill was passed 252-174 and sent to the Senate after a
debate sprinkled withreferences to the fact that voting for pay
raises was a politically sensitive proposition.
   House members now make $89,500 a year. Under the new bill, they
would make more than $120,000 within less than 14 months.
   ``We've decided to reinvest in this institution and take the
responsibility for its future,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif.,
co-chairman of the task force that drafted the legislation.
   ``This is a little like root canal work without the anesthesia.
It's painful, but it needs to be done,'' said Rep. Thomas Downey,
D-N.Y.
   But Rep. James A. Traficant, D-Ohio, argued against the
legislation.
   ``I understand the game _ we come with ethics reform and we
sneak in a pay raise,'' Traficant said. ``Now is not that time,''
he said, citing huge budget and trade deficits. ``You're not
rewarded for losing.''
   The package, introduced Wednesday by House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., had strong bipartisan support and the backing of
President Bush.
   ``This is truly an ethics package,'' said House Minority Whip
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., citing a series of reforms that would
accompany the salary increases spread over the next 14 months.
   The plan does not include a raise for the Senate, where Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said lawmakers might go for a more
gradual pay plan and elimination of honoraria. The issue will come
up Friday, he said today.
   Under the plan, House members, federal judges and top executive
branch officials would receive 7.9 percent in cost of living raises
by January, making up for inflation since the last congressional
pay raise in early 1987.
   On Jan. 1, 1991, those officials would receive another
as-yet-undetermined cost of living increase _ whatever rank and
file civil servants are given then _ plus a 25 percent pay boost.
At that time, new rules would require House members to stop
pocketing money from speeches and limit other outside earned income
to 15 percent of their congressional salaries.
   The total pay increase would be about 35 percent if there was no
1991 cost of living raise. If it followed the pattern of the
previous two years _ 4.1 percent and 3.6 percent _ the pay raise
would be closer to 40 percent with salaries reaching about $125,000.
   The long-awaited package was unveiled Wednesday by the joint
House leadership just as Bush was sending a letter to Capitol Hill
giving it his blessing.
   ``In my view, the bill would effect a tremendous change in the
landscape of government ethics standards,'' the president said.
   Leaders appeared confident the Senate will approve the raises
for the House and other officials, although that scenario would
repeat a situation that existed seven years ago when, for about six
months, the House was paid more than the Senate.
   That prospect is less than attractive to many senators, and
there appeared this week to be growing support for the House plan.
However, Senate rules make it possible for even a single senator to
block the majority will, especially with Congress trying to end its
session before Thanksgiving.
   The House plan was worked out in close consultation with the
White House, which has been desperately seeking to raise salaries
for federal judges and top agency officials.
   President Reagan, as he left office in January, proposed a 51
percent pay raise for Congress and the other officials but Congress
was forced to kill it after a storm of public protest.
   Wednesday's letter of support from the president was crucial not
only for GOP support but for Democrats, who will use it to
inoculate themselves from Republican attacks in next year's
elections.
   At the joint news conference on Wednesday, the drafters of the
new plan conceded it wasn't without faults. For example, the
honoraria ban allows members to make speeches and have the hosts
donate to charity on their behalf _ a useful political tool.

   The National Endowment for the Arts today
reversed itself and awarded a $10,000 grant to an AIDS art exhibit
just hours before the show was scheduled to open.
   Endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer, who toured the show and
discussed the grant with a group of New York City artists on
Wednesday, announced the decision.
   ``After consulting with members of the National Council on the
Arts, several of whom have also seen the show, I have agreed to
approve the request of Artists Space ... and will release the grant
for the exhibition only,'' said Frohnmayer. The endowment said it
will not fund the show's catalog, which Frohnmayer has called too
political to merit federal support.
   The show, ``Witnesses Against Our Vanishing,'' opens this
evening at Artists Space, said Susan Wyatt, the private gallery's
executive director.
   Frohnmayer had said at a Wednesday news conference that he
planned to discuss the funding issue with members of the endowment
and ``reflect on what I've seen'' in a quick tour Wednesday morning.
   ``The part of the show I've had a chance to see lacked artistic
merit,'' Frohnmayer said.
   The show, featuring works by 23 painters, sculptors and
photographers that portray the effects of acquired immune
deficiency syndrome on the arts community, was unchanged by the
funding controversy, Wyatt said.
   Frohnmayer said last week that the endowment was withholding the
$10,000 because the show's content differed from what its grant
application said and because the show lacked artistic merit.
   The endowment had approved a grant in May for the show, which
has some sexual images. But since then, Congress has passed a law
putting limits on federal support of art that could be deemed to be
obscene.
   Frohnmayer has objected to the catalog for the AIDS exhibit for
its denunciation of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., chief sponsor of the
anti-obscenity law, and other public figures who have taken a
conservative position on the AIDS issue.
   The artists whose works are featured in the show issued a
statement read by participant Allen Frame that said the endowment
was becoming ``a vehicle for repression.''
   ``We understand this suppression to be endemic of a broad
pattern of government challenges to individual and community
rights. Thus it enrages us, but does not surprise us, that by
expressing ourselves on the subject of AIDS we are now under
attack,'' it said.
   Inverna Lockpez, president of the National Association of
Artists Organizations, charged Frohnmayer had ``allowed the
perception to evolve that he's caving into homophobic tactics on
the part of a few vocal congressmen.''

   The nation's merchandise trade deficit in
September tumbled to $7.9 billion, its smallest imbalance in nearly
five years, the government said Thursday in a report that analysts
viewed as evidence of strong overseas economies but weakness at
home.
   The Commerce Department said the September deficit fell 21.4
percent from August, when the trade gap posted a $10.1 billion
difference, the largest of the year.
   The drop resulted from a 3.9 percent decline in imports to $39
billion and a 1.9 percent gain in exports to $31.1 billion. The
deficit is the difference between the two.
   Analysts said that while the improvement is encouraging on the
surface, it is, as chief economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co.,
said, ``coming about principally from a weak U.S. economy and very
prosperous overseas economies.''
   Reaction also was unenthusiastic on Wall Street, where stock
market observers also interpreted the drop in imports as evidence
of weakening consumer spending.
   But the figures were good news for the Bush adminstration, which
based its predictions of healthy economic growth partly on the
belief that exports would keep expanding.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said that while imports have
fallen back to their monthly average for the year, exports remain
high. Mosbacher noted the figures were in line with administration
expectations of a 1989 deficit ranging between $105 billion and
$110 billion.
   But Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford told a Senate Banking
subcommittee that while Thursday's trade report was ``very
positive,'' the improvement could stall by next year unless the
United States and its major trading partners do a better job of
coordinating their economic policies.
   ``Further improvement ... during 1990 ... we think will be
modest at best and there's soe possibility of a deterioration,'' he
said. ``However, it's interesting to note that the adjustment
process continues.''
   To maintain progress on shrinking the trade gap, the U.S. must
push down its budget deficit and Japan and West Germany must
stimulate their domestic demand for imports, he said.
   The trade gap for the first nine months on an annualized basis
was $107.2 billion, compared with a $118.5 billion imbalance for
all of 1988.
   The September imbalance was the narrowest since a $6.8 billion
deficit in December 1984.
   Leading the exports was a 72.8 percent gain in civilian aircraft
shipments to $1.97 billion. Mosbacher said most of the aircraft
went to Western Europe.
   The United States is running a $1.4 billion trade surplus with
the European Economic Community for the year. Sinai said that was
evidence of prosperous economies since those nations continue to
buy U.S. goods despite a relatively expensive dollar, which make
those goods more costly.
   Michael K. Evns, of Evans Economics Inc. in Washington, said
European growth has doubled from 1988 to 1989 and its economy will
continue to be robust for the next two or three years, enhancing
the export outlook.
   At the same time, Americans spent less on imports in September,
particularly for big-ticket capital goods and other industrial
materials used in manufacturing.
   ``This confirms the manufacturing recession that seems to be in
place,'' Sinai said.
   An exception to the drop in imports was consumer goods, which
rose slightly, not surprising since consumers have continued to
spend dispite weakness in manufacturing.
   The manufacturing sector has been particularly hit by
sluggishness as the Federal Reserve slows the economy by keeping a
tight rein on credit to contain inflation.
   In addition to aircraft, export improvements included office
equipment and machinery, automobiles, telecommunications equipment
and industrial machinery.
   The nation's foreign oil bill fell 7.6 percent to $4 billion in
September. The amount of imported oil dropped to 8.2 million
barrels a day from 8.7 million in August, while the price per
barrel rose to $16.38 from $16.14.
   As usual, the largest trade deficit in September was with Japan,
an imbalance of $4.1 billion, up from $4 billion in August. The
deficit was $1.3 billion with Taiwan, $700 million with Canada,
$500 million with South Korea and $700 million with China.

<HEAD>RICO Overhaul Bill Stalls as Senators Rally to DeConcini</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate efforts to overhaul the nation's
racketeering law stalled Thursday while members of both parties
rallied to defend the sponsor, Arizona Democrat Dennis DeConcini,
from consumer advocate Ralph Nader's charge that the bill was
designed to dilute curbs against white-collar crime.
   ``This isn't just some little Mickey Mouse bill that's supported
by business,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, declared after the bill
bogged down in the Judiciary Committee.
   The DeConcini measure would overhaul the 1970 Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act. The law, known as RICO, for
short, was primarily intended as a weapon against criminal mobs.
   Recent years, however, have witnessed a sharp upturn in civil
lawsuits filed under RICO against insurance companies, savings and
loan associations, accounting firms and an array of other
businesses.
   DeConcini's bill would cut back on provisions that enable those
who file such RICO suits to collect triple damages.
   The Judiciary Committee had been expected to draw up its final
version of the bill and send it to the floor on Thursday. But
efforts to do so broke down when the committee ran out of time with
Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, saying he still had substantial
reservations.
   ``I'm willing to reform RICO but not to gut it,'' Metzenbaum
said.
   Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., said that he
would try to make time for a full-scale debate on the measure
within the committee before Thanksgiving, when lawmakers hope to
have their work wrapped up for the year.
   But it appeared that final committee action on the measure might
have to wait until next year.
   After the bill stalled, members of the committee rallied to
defend DeConcini against Nader's charges a day earlier. Biden said
he had seen ``nothing but good, solid, reasonable intentions from
the senator from Arizona.''
   ``I think it's shameful to in any way question the motives of
Sen. DeConcini for his involvement in this bill,'' Metzenbaum said.
   ``I think the senator from Arizona has been badly maligned on
this bill just in the last couple of days,'' Hatch said.
   On Wednesday, Nader counted DeConcini among ``a panoply of
purchased politicians'' who aided Phoenix financier Charles
Keating, the central figure in the burgeoning Lincoln Savings and
Loan scandal.
   Nader's charge was rooted in the testimony of Edwin J. Gray,
former chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, who told a
House panel earlier this month that DeConcini, in the presence of
four other senators, once asked him to drop a rule barring risky
investments by Lincoln Savings. DeConcini and the others all
disputed Gray's account of the conversation.
   ``Now the ringleader of the Keating Five, Sen. DeConcini, is
responding to the swirling controversy by pushing a bill that would
weaken the white-collar crime laws,'' Nader told a news conference.
He said DeConcini's bill ``would gut the very law used by
regulators against his friend Charles Keating.''

<HEAD>Bush Awards 11 Medals For Arts; Bernstein Rejects His</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with grant decision reversed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein is
refusing to accept the 1990 National Medal of Arts because of a
controversy over the cancellation of a federal grant to an art
exhibit on AIDS, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said today.
   Fitzwater commented a few hours before the National Endowment
for the Arts reversed itself and awarded the $10,000 grant for the
New York City show. It was not known immediately whether this
change would have any bearing on Bernstein.
   Bernstein ``wrote to us in the last few days'' to say he had
changed his mind about accepting the award, Fitzwater told
reporters flying with President Bush to Houston.
   He confirmed a report in The Washington Post today that
Bernstein was protesting the cancellation of the grant.
   The newspaper also reported that another medal recipient,
painter Robert Motherwell, had offered to replace the lost grant
funds with his own money.
   In New York, Bernstein's manager, Harry Kraut, was out Wednesday
evening. There was no answer at telephones listed for Bernstein's
publicists.
   The White House announced Wednesday that 12 writers, artists and
art patrons and a corporation are being given the award. One medal
will go posthumously to pianist Vladimir Horowitz, who died Nov. 5.
   Bernstein was not on the list announced by the White House, but
officials acknowledged he had been selected for the honor.
   The other award-winners include jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie,
writer John Updike and photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt, as well as
the Dayton Hudson Corp. of Minneapolis, cited for its corporate
sponsorship of the arts.
   The president and wife, Barbara, will present the medals to the
recipients at a White House luncheon in their honor Friday. It is
the fifth annual presentation of the awards.
   The other winners are:
   Leopold Adler, a preservationist and civic leader from Savannah,
Ga.; dancer and choreographer Katherine Dunham of East St. Louis,
Ill.; museum director Martin Friedman of Minneapolis; Leigh
Gerdine, a civic leader and arts patron from St. Louis, Mo.;
sculptor Walter Kirkland Hancock of St. Louis; writer Czeslaw
Milosz of Berkeley, Calif.
   Eisenstaedt is from New York, Updike from Beverly Farms, Mass.,
Motherwell from Greenwich, Conn., and Gillespie from Englewood, N.J.
   The $10,000 grant had been slated for Artists Space, a gallery
where an exhibit on AIDS entitled ``Witness: Against Our
Vanishing'' opened today.
   Endowment chairman John E. Fronhmayer canceled the grant, saying
the exhibit was ``political rather than artistic in nature.''
Fronhmayer toured the show and said Wednesday he saw nothing to
change his mind.
   Just before the show opened today, however, Frohnmayer announced
the reversal. ``After consulting with members of the National
Council on the Arts, several of whom have also seen the show, I
have agreed to approve the request of Artists Space ... and will
release the grant for the exhibition only,'' he said in a statement.
   The endowment said it will not fund the show's catalog, which
Frohnmayer has called too political to merit federal support.

<HEAD>China Orders Crackdown on Corruption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has ordered all state-run
factories, enterprises and work units to crack down on ``little
coffers'' _ funds siphoned off from official projects and profits,
leading newspapers said Thursday.
   ``These `little coffers' are an important reason for losses by
the state treasury,'' said the Workers' Daily. ``It is not only
contributing to waste and corruption, but also destroys the spirit
of the party and social temperment.''
   ``Little coffers'' consist of misappropriated cash such as
``funds illegally made from the seizure and interception of state
and unit revenue, taking over public property and illegal
savings,'' said the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official
newspaper.
   Such funds also are hidden by accountants as they ``are not
listed in the accounts of the financial departments of units and
are not included in final accounts,'' the People's Daily said.
   The State Council, China's legislature, has issued a circular
calling for self-policing by leaders at all levels to root out such
fraud and profiteering.
   The reports did not give the estimated value of economic losses,
but such corruption, from small-scale price-gouging to massive
embezzlement, is rampant in China.
   In October, Shanghai discovered 1,256 ``little coffers''
amounting to $7.2 million, the People's Daily said.
   Similar funds totaling $13 million were recovered in Hubei
province and the city of Tianjin bordering Beijing, and China Oil
and Gas Corp. recovered $19 million, the newspaper said.
   ``Winning back ill-gotten gains is of crucial value in
consolidating and rectifying the situation, and strengthening the
construction of a clean and honest government,'' said the circular,
reprinted in several newspapers.
   Organizations that disclose ``little coffers'' formed by turning
public money to private gain in their ranks and report to
authorities by Dec. 15 will be treated leniently, the reports said.
Those enterprises will be allowed to retain half their ill-gotten
profits, while turning over the other half to the state, it said.
   Those which do not turn themselves in, however, must return any
money they have spent, turn over all illegal profits to the state
and be fined, according to the circular. It added that the
superiors of those involved also would be held responsible.

<HEAD>Illinois Law Has Nationwide Impact, Abortion Rights Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Illinois abortion clinic regulations, if
upheld in a key Supreme Court case, would have a devastating
nationwide impact on women's access to the operation, abortion
rights groups said Thursday.
   The regulations have ``the potential to seriously curtail, if
not eliminate entirely, the ability of most American women to
choose abortion,'' said Barbara Radford, head of the National
Abortion Federation. If the court upholds the Illinois law, she
said, ``it could turn the clock back to an era of virtual
prohibition of abortion.''
   The federation and Planned Parenthood announced the results of a
national survey that said 98 percent of abortion clinics would be
violating at least one of the Illinois rules if they were adopted
by the clinics' home states.
   Three-fourths of the clinics said the regulations would force
them to relocate and could drive them out of business.
   Supporters of the Illinois law have said the impact would be
minimal _ adding $45 to the cost of an abortion.
   The high court plans to hear arguments in the Illinois case Dec.
5. But talks are under way between state officials and an abortion
clinic owner to settle the dispute and eliminate the need for a
ruling by the justices.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan, a Democrat who plans to
run for governor next year, is leading the effort to reach a
settlement.
   Ms. Radford said even if a compromise disposes of the Illinois
case, the issues it raised will remain alive.
   ``We're still going to see efforts by other states to adopt
regulations almost identical'' to the Illinois law, she said.
   The 254 clinics that responded to the survey announced Thursday
perform about one-third of the 1.5 million abortions each year in
the United States. Nearly all said conforming to the regulations
would be extremely costly and perhaps impossible.
   The Illinois regulations were declared unconstitutional by
federal courts that said they would force the clinics to become
``the functional equivalent of small hospitals.''
   For example, the rules require separate facilities such as
lockers and lavatories for male and female employees and eight-foot
wide corridors for patients.
   Dr. Louise Tyrer of Planned Parenthood, in a statement read by
colleague William Hamilton, said the rules are not designed to
protect the health of women.
   ``We have a case of politicians claiming to know more about
medical procedure than the medical profession. These politicians
would have us all believe that abortions are dangerous,'' Dr. Tyrer
said. She said abortions are safer than practically any other
commonly performed surgery.
   The Supreme Court is reviewing two other abortion cases this
term. They test the validity of Minnesota and Ohio laws requiring
notification of parents whose minor daughters want abortions.
   The justices in July gave states new power to regulate
abortions, upholding a Missouri law while stopping short of
overturning their 1973 ruling that said women have a constitutional
right to an abortion.
   The July ruling touched off widespread activity in state
legislatures and state political races.

<HEAD>Panel Told of Escalating, Discriminatory Drug Prices</HEAD>

   Rising prescription drug costs are forcing
some people to choose between meals and medicine as they encounter
far steeper prices than large purchasers, such as hospitals, are
charged, a Senate panel was told Thursday.
   ``Something is seriously wrong when the incredible disparity in
the cost of drugs is realized,'' pharmacist Michael Berryman told
the Special Committee on Aging.
   Berryman, chairman of the board that oversees Virginia's
Medicaid program, said an elderly woman in his home town of
Kenbridge, Va., pays $120 a month for the same drugs that cost a
local hospital $30.
   The committee chairman, Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said the
hearing was called to address a ``crisis of affordability'' on
prescription drugs, whose prices he said are rising three times
faster than inflation.
   Pryor said that while large purchasers, such as hospitals, have
negotiated reduced prices for drugs, manufacturers have resisted
similar arrangements with state Medicaid systems and other
government programs.
   A report by the committee's majority staff said manufacturers
``have waged an all-out national campaign to undermine and
frustrate state efforts to negotiate lower prices for
therapeutically interchangeable drugs.''
   It also said drug companies cite their research budgets as a
justification for high prices, but pour a big share of that money
into developing so-called ``me too'' drugs that largely duplicate
medications already on the market.
   The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association sent Pryor a report
disputing that point and maintaining that the industry's research
``produces significant new compounds that improve existing
therapies and drive down the overall cost of medical care.''
   Officials from several major drug companies declined to testify
at the hearing, citing the proprietary nature of their pricing
decisions.
   The Belgian Consumers' Association, an independent institute
that conducts tests and surveys, compared prices for 25 drugs in
the United States and Europe and reported to the committee that
prices in the United States averaged 54 percent higher.
   Derek Hodel, executive director of the People With AIDS Health
Group in New York, told the committee U.S. drug companies ``charge
exhorbitant prices for desperately needed drugs.''
   He cited the case of aerosol pentamidine, used to treat
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, the leading cause of death among
people with AIDS. The drug retails for approximately $150 in the
United States while its equivalent sells for $26 in England, Hodel
said.
   ``Because of the high U.S. price, many of those in need of this
treatment simply do without,'' Hodel said. Others seek to import
the drug from abroad, he said.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., said the elderly are particularly
vulnerable to rising drug prices, because more than half have no
insurance coverage for prescriptions.
   ``When it's all over, people often decide they're going to go
without the drugs they because they can't afford it,'' Heinz said.
   Jake Green, 75, of Winchester, Ky., told the panel his costs for
a month's supply of Mestinon to treat the neuromuscular disease
myasthenia gravis have risen from $40 in January to $94 next month
through a discount pill bank. At a pharmacy, the cost would be
$136, he said.
   ``To be honest with you, I fear the day when I will not be able
to afford to purchase the medicine which is keeping me alive,''
Green said.
   His concern was echoed by Leona Bivens, 73, of Seal Beach,
Calif., who has Parkinson's disease and a yearly drug bill of about
$3,500.
   ``I thought I had a good retirement plan, but how long can I pay
the druggist's bill?'' she asked.

   Cosmetics queen Estee Lauder opened the doors
Thursday of a chic boutique filled with her pricey line of makeup
and perfumes, but there was some question about whether Soviet
women had enough dollars for her scents.
   Company officials said they would sell ordinary Soviet women
American-style cosmetics at American-sized prices, a tall challenge
in a nation where the average Soviet salary rarely tops $245 a
month.
   A tube of lipstick can go for $15 in New York. A quarter ounce
of the company's White Linen perfume can sell for $55.
   Still, there was no shortage of curious customers on opening day.
   The ceremony on Gorky Street in the center of Moscow, two blocks
from the Kremlin, attracted dozens of passers-by who were kept
behind police barricades as Mrs. Lauder and Nanouli Shevardnadze,
the wife of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, cut the
ribbon.
   Well-dressed Soviet women later packed the shop, the latest
curiosity in a country that prides itself on its egalitarian
principles.
   Mrs. Lauder told the crowd gathered outside the store that the
women of Moscow were already beautiful and ``we are going to keep
every woman beautiful.''
   As an afterthought, she added, ``we are going to keep the men
beautiful, too,'' with sales of men's after shaves and colognes.
   Company president Leonard Lauder said the company is selling its
products for dollars to the Moscow city council and the U.S.S.R.
Ministry of Trade, which in turn are selling the cosmetics to
Soviets for rubles.
   The shop itself is owned and operated by the city council and
the ministry. The Soviet staff was trained by Estee Lauder
personnel, he said.
   He said Estee Lauder products have been available in Moscow for
about 10 years, but only in special shops for foreigners and joint
ventures accepting only hard currency.
   ``We want to sell to ordinary Soviet people,'' Leonard Lauder
said. ``We will charge about what you would pay in New York.''
   Mrs. Lauder also said the prices would be about the same.
   For tourists, shopping at Estee Lauder will be a better deal. At
the official rate, the ruble is worth $1.62, but under new
regulations for tourists and other foreigners, the cost of a ruble
is only 16 cents, which will make the Estee Lauder shop a bargain
for foreigners.
   Thus, for an American tourist, eyeliner that costs 6 rubles
could be purchased for the equivalent of 96 cents. Of course,
that's if the foreigner wanted to brave the long line.
   Mrs. Lauder said, ``every woman and every man can come to my
shop. It doesn't cost much, cosmetics go a long way,'' she said.
   The idea to open a shop for Soviet people came during a visit by
Raisa Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet president, to Mrs. Lauder
in New York during a trip in 1988, Lauder officials said.

   Residents of Rongelap, a tiny Pacific atoll,
contended Thursday that their island remains unsafe nearly four
decades after the U.S. government tested a nuclear bomb in the area.
   ``The Rongelap people wish to return home,'' said Jeton Anjain,
who respresents the Rongelapese in the Marshall Islands government.
``However, we will only return home if Rongelap Atoll is determined
to be safe.''
   Such a determination could be made only through a comprehensive
radiological survey of the atoll, which has not been done since the
so-called ``Bravo'' test irradiated the area in 1954, he told a
House interior subcommittee hearing.
   The Reagan and Bush administrations have contended that Rongelap
is safe for habitation. Roughly 350 Rongelapese, concerned about
incidents of leukemia and tyroid cancer, evacuated the island in
1985 to live on Mejato, another island.
   Anjain said the Energy Department believes the Rongelapese
should return to their home island ``despite the fact that the
Rongelap environment today is highly contaminated with radiation.''
   Non-voting Delegate Ron de Lugo, D-V.I. and the chairman of the
insular and international affairs subcommittee, said that although
government officials have used a 1982 study to back up claims
Rongelap is safe, ``the report realy made no such finding.''
   But Bush administration officials said they would spend the next
six months reviewing the literature and studies on Rongelap.
   The six-month review, requested by the Energy Department, will
``conduct an internal review of how the agency reached its present
position on the issue of safety and habitability on Rongelap,''
said Stella Guerra, the assistant secretary of interior.
   ``The Department of Interior shares the desire of the energy
secretary to ensure that all health and environmental impacts, and
the concerns of the Rongelap people, have been properly
addressed,'' she said in prepared remarks.
   Rongelap is part of the Marshall Islands, a former U.S. trust
territory. The islands now have a commonwealth relationship with
the United States under the Compact of Free Association.
   Under the compact, the United States agreed to pay nuclear test
victims $150 million in exchange for the Marshall Islands giving up
the claims of its citizens.
   Some of that money was used for an independent scientific review
of the 1982 Energy Department report. De Lugo said information in
the preliminary review, completed in May 1988, ``appears to be
troubling.''
   Among other things, de Lugo said, the review stated that
Rongelap may be safe for adults but more study is needed to
determine if children are safe.
   The review also said people would have to mostly rely on
imported food for 30 to 50 years.

<HEAD>Controversial Exhibit Opens _ With $10,000 Federal Grant</HEAD>

   The National Endowment for the Arts reversed
itself and returned a $10,000 grant for a controversial AIDS art
show just hours before its Thursday night opening.
   ``After consulting with members of the National Council on the
Arts, several of whom have also seen the show, I have agreed to
approve the request of Artists Space ... and will release the grant
for the exhibition only,'' NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer said in
a statement.
   The chairman on Wednesday had visited the exhibit at the gallery
Artists Space in lower Manhattan. After his quick tour, he said
there was a chance of reversal but added, ``The part of the show
I've had a chance to see lacked artistic merit.''
   The NEA statement was released four hours before the opening of
the show, which has a total budget of $30,000. The endowment said
it will not fund the show's catalog, which Frohnmayer had called
too political to merit federal support.
   At the gallery, the NEA decision was hailed as a victory for the
artists and the First Amendment.
   ``We won a battle, but the war is still on _ the war against
homophobia, AIDS phobia and any undermining of our freedom of
speech,'' said Nan Goldin, organizer of the exhibit, ``Witnesses
Against Our Vanishing.''
   Susan Wyatt, museum executive director, called it ``a great day.
We've got a great show opening.''
   The show includes paintings, photographs and sculptures by 23
artists depicting the effect of the AIDS epidemic on the artistic
community.
   Some of the works are sexually explicit, and the catalog
contains derogatory references to Cardinal John O'Connor,
archbishop of the New York Archdiocese, and to lawmakers who
supported a law restricting funding of art deemed obscene.
   The endowment had approved a grant in May for the show. But
since then, Congress passed the law on art deemed obscene.
   The NEA said earlier this month it would withdraw support;
Frohnmayer said the show's content differed from what its grant
application said and that it lacked ``artistic merit.''
   Goldin said Thursday that regardless of the NEA's final
decision, she wants Frohnmayer to resign.
   ``It seems he's playing to the people with the most influence,''
she said. ``But the show has gotten the attention it deserves. It's
too bad it had to be this way.''
   She said the dispute reflected the controversy over how to deal
with the epidemic. Supporters of the law restricting support of the
arts ``are the same people who think that AIDS victims should be
quarantined,'' she said.

<HEAD>22,000 Egyptian Workers Back Home, Deaths Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds more Egyptian workers arrived by
plane from Iraq on Thursday while authorities investigated why
scores of the workers have died and more than 22,000 have returned
in recent weeks, officials said.
   Some workers said they were mistreated or lost their jobs to
Iraqi veterans who returned to civilian life since the eight-year
Iran-Iraq war ended in a cease-fire in August last year.
   Egyptian workers, numbering about 2 million by Iraqi count and
thus the largest foreign work force, have been hard-hit by postwar
shifts in Iraq's economy.
   An airport police officer said more than 600 workers arrived
Thursday on two Iraqi Airways and one EgyptAir flights, with a
dozen additional flights expected the rest of the day.
   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 22,000
Egyptian workers returned from Iraq through Wednesday since the
first of the month. Others went from Iraq to other Arab countries
like Jordan or Kuwait, but he said he did not know how many.
   Officials at Cairo International Airport's cargo department said
50 Egyptian corpses arrived from Iraq this month. They said Iraqi
certificates with them indicated violent deaths in most cases but
refused to give details.
   A senior security official at the airport said Monday that about
100 bodies arrived last month. Cargo officials said the rate in
months preceding the still-unexplained crisis ranged at 10 to 15 a
month.
   Egypt has ordered an investigation into the death rate and the
worker exodus. On Wednesday, it set up a special committee to
monitor the situation at the airport and report directly to Prime
Minister Atef Sedki.
   The problem will be thrashed out at a meeting in Cairo next
weekend of an Iraqi-Egyptian committee that convenes every six
months to review bilateral relations. Sedki and Iraqi Deputy
Premier Taha Yassin Ramadan co-chair the committee.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday denied that
Egyptians are being killed maliciously and promised an
investigation of claims that they are being ill-treated.
   He conceded some may have died in ``quarrels, whether with
Iraqis or among themselves,'' but said the number of deaths was not
alarming considering the Egyptian population in his country.
   Interviews with Egyptian returnees on Thursday showed they left
because they were fired and could find no other jobs or because
they could not tolerate ``insulting treatment'' by Iraqi employers.
One worker attributed the violent deaths to frequent fights with
Iraqis and to high-risk jobs.
   El-Sayed Khalifa, 30, a farmer who worked in construction or
agriculture in Iraq for the past five years, said he left after
``demobilized Iraqi soldiers came back from the front.''
   ``Iraqi employers began treating me and other Egyptians in an
insulting way, as though we had become a heavy burden all of a
sudden,'' he said.
   Construction worker Sayed Gomaa, 35, who worked three years in
Iraq, said: ``Some weeks ago, a group of young Iraqis who were just
out of the military appeared and demanded work. So the contractor
simply fired me.''
   Carpenter Gomaa Darwish, 23, attributed the deaths to two main
causes: ``One, frequent quarrels with jealous, job-seeking Iraqis,
in which firearms and knives sometimes were used. Two, the hazards
facing many thousands of Egyptian construction workers. Trying to
make more money, they work overtime and many overworked laborers
fall from scaffolds or die in other accidents.''
   Several of those interviewed complained of salary reductions of
as much as 50 percent as well as delays and cutbacks in remittances
to their families in Egypt.

   Employees at a jewelry store huddled in
the vault while the shop came down around them. A man in an
apartment building stayed in his bathtub while the bathroom walls
crumbled and fell.
   Those were among the stories people in this northern Alabama
city swapped on Thursday as they assessed the damage from a tornado
that whipped through the heart of the city in a flash, leaving at
least 17 people dead and hundreds homeless.
   ``Everybody was screaming and windows started breaking and the
roof started to fall,'' recalled Vincent Davis, a fourth-grader at
Jones Valley Elementary School. ``The whole top story flew off.
Everybody wanted their mom.''
   Vincent was staying late at school Wednesday when the twister
hit shortly after 4:30 p.m. He was taken to a hospital with minor
injuries; five of about 30 children in a kindergarten class also
were reported hurt.
   Lynn Culpepper was in his bathtub at the Waterford Square
apartments, where at least a dozen buildings were destroyed. ``The
next thing I knew, glass was breaking and I was rolling on the
ground,'' he recalled.
   ``It was just black, and then there was this tumbling feeling
with debris flying around everywhere. When I opened my eyes and
looked around, there was just a pile of rubble where the apartments
used to be.''
   Culpepper's head and arms were cut in the collapse.
   Manager Bob Husman of a Golbro jewelry store ordered employees
into the vault shortly before the roof and walls crashed down on
him, 20 feet from the vault.
   ``In the jewelry business, the vault is the safest place,'' he
said. ``I had structural steel on me but managed to crawl out. It
was the worst kind of nightmare.''
   The employees in the vault were dug out an hour after the
collapse, shaken but not hurt.
   Rick Snider was in the bakery aisle of a supermarket.
   ``Part of the roof was coming off,'' he said. ``Some ladies were
crying, but it was quite calm. A checkout lady was hit with a cash
register. People were shouting, `Can I help?' and they were leading
people to the light. There was no screaming or hysterical stuff. I
came out and I couldn't believe the damage.''
   For Ed Rolan, a medic, the devastation brought back memories of
Vietnam. Rolan, who was driving home when the tornado hit, went
right to work helping the stricken motorists around him.
   ``One lady was thrown from her car and I thought she was dead,''
he said. ``I came back by her later and saw she had changed
positions. It took 30 minutes to get a stretcher to her.''
   The enormity of the death and destruction ``sank in very
quickly,'' Rolan said. ``This is the closest to death I have been
since Vietnam.''

   The network of radio talk show hosts credited with
defeating an effort to raise congressmen's pay says it was caught
off guard when the House sped toward another salary increase, but
it's mobilizing for the debate in the Senate.
   Sparked by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, radio talk show hosts
around the country began a rush Thursday to urge listeners to
revolt, and fast. The Senate could vote on raises Friday.
   One of the biggest complaints of the talk show hosts was the way
the latest effort took by surprise those who earlier this year were
deemed instrumental in killing a pay raise.
   ``Mostly, the response we've been hearing is about the process,
about getting it done in a couple of days. Nobody really knew about
it and they perceive it as a scheme on the part of leadership, that
`leadership is in the tank,''' said Jerry Williams, the talkmaster
at Boston station WRKO who helped spearhead a campaign against the
last congressional pay raise plan, which included a deluge of
teabags sent to Capitol Hill.
   Williams said Nader notified him of the quick proposal and vote
in the House.
   ``It's just a backroom political deal that they are ramrodding
through in the dark of night,'' said Mike Siegel of KING in
Seattle. ``It flies in the face of everything in the system. They
announced it one day and voted on it the next day without any
chance for public discussion.''
   Siegel said there were a few actions that should have been taken
before any raise was considered.
   ``There should have been no raise of any kind considered until
there is a statute eliminating the honoraria,'' he said. ``And they
should have included a statute that the raises take effect with the
next congressional session.
   But since the House on Thursday approved a plan that would raise
pay from $89,500 to $120,000 within less than 14 months, Williams,
Seigel and their broadcasting cohorts have begun focusing attention
on the Senate, where debate will continue.
   ``It will be a little easier for people to respond because they
don't have to respond to so many lawmakers _ there are only two
senators in their state,'' Williams said, who began Thursday's
program by giving out the Washington phone numbers of Senate
leaders.
   ``All these folks in Congress say they are having trouble
attracting new blood. Well, I don't think they will have any
problem now,'' said Tom Leykis, of KFI in Los Angeles.
   ``Next year, a week before Election Day, I will read out loud
the names of everyone who voted for the pay raise, every day, and
make sure they get new blood in there,'' he said. ``If that's what
they want, the pay raise, then that's what they are going to get.''
   WJNO in West Palm, Fla., held a ``battle of the talk show
hosts'' Thursday with four hosts on the air at once.
   ``Congressmen should not be paid so much that they are making
five times what the average wage earner takes home,'' said Jack
Cole, who said his local listeners were about 80 percent against
the raise.

<HEAD>Labor Ducks Abortion Stand</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO declined Thursday to take a stand
on abortion, an issue which split labor leaders on the final day of
a convention dedicated to union unity.
   Though pro-choice oratory dominated the final session, the
convention put aside for study a half-dozen resolutions calling
upon the union to embrace, in one way or another, the stance taken
by most of its political allies, including the Democratic Party and
various women's and civil rights groups.
   The four-day gathering was highlighted by the appearance of
Polish Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and a number of rowdy
demonstrations to promote labor unity in several major strikes.
   Labor traditionally has steered clear of the abortion issue, and
had any of the resolutions come up for a vote it was likely that
the federation's older, predominantly male leaders could have
mustered the strength to defeat them.
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland himself said two months ago that
he did not believe the federation should take a stand on abortion.
   Kirkland and other leaders struck a deal with the pro-choice
sponsors to allow for the speechmaking and then refer the
resolutions to the federation's Executive Council.
   ``We did not choose this issue,'' said Susan Cowell, vice
president of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union and a
leading member of a small but vocal group of women labor activists.
``The Reagan courts have forced us to take a stand on this issue.
... The labor movement must choose sides and lead as we always
have.''
   Nine delegates, including two men, spoke in favor of adopting
pro-choice positions. Although no one spoke against the proposals,
the socially conservative leaders of the federation's building
trades unions remain opposed and wield considerable power on the
Executive Council.
   Still, several influential council members interviewed this week
predicted the 33-member board would endorse a woman's right to
choose to have an abortion if it could agree on language
acknowledging moral and religious concerns. The sponsors of the
pro-choice resolutions urged the council to act by its February
meeting. A decision then could determine whether labor makes the
issue a factor in its support of 1990 political candidates.
   ``Let us now be in the vanguard regarding the rights of our
women,'' said Arlene Collins of the Oregon AFL-CIO, the first state
federation to adopt a pro-choice platform. ``The elections of the
past few days have proven that pro-choice is not divisive, but a
winner,'' she said, referring to victories by pro-choice candidates
in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races a week ago.
   ``It is working women, poor women who will pay with their lives
and their futures is we sit by and government interferes,'' said
Mary Butz of the Sacramento (Calif.) Central Labor Council.
   The labor movement has longstanding ties to the Catholic church,
and some opponents of the pro-choice resolutions have said
privately that taking such a stance could hurt union organizing
among blue-collar Catholics.

   The settled, prosperous nations of
Western Europe have been stunned by developments in the suddenly
rambunctious East and are avidly seeking a common strategy of
response.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France quickly arranged a
summit, scheduled for Saturday, of the 12 European Community
nations to discuss the rapid change in Eastern Europe.
   ``It is crucially important that the European Community should
have a meeting of minds on it,'' said Peter Ludlow, director of the
Center for European Policy Studies, a think tank based in Brussels.
``If ever we ought to seek common interest, it's here.''
   The Paris summit comes two weeks before a meeting between
President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at which Eastern
Europe also is certain to be a major topic.
   A conference of the 12 leaders will allow Western Europe to
``make a contribution not after the event, but before,'' said an EC
official, speaking privately.
   Some in Western Europe worry that the unexpected events in the
Soviet bloc, especially East Germany, could derail the community's
plans to create a single market of 320 million consumers in late
1992.
   By that date, the dozen nations want to abolish the many trade
barriers that obstruct the free flow of money, people, goods and
services.
   West Germany's economy, third-largest in the world, overshadows
those of the other community members, giving it a powerful role in
the campaign for a continental market.
   The recent opening of East Germany's borders raises the
possibility of German reunification after 40 years of division,
however, and could distract West Germany from the Common Market
goal.
   Stephen King, international economist at James Capel and Co. in
London, said: ``The pace of integration may well be slowed to some
extent. West Germany must be more interested in looking toward the
East'' and may ``devote less political and economic resources'' to
the European Community.
   Officials of the European Community say it must be strong to
respond effectively to the uncertain events in the East.
   Jacques Delors, president of the community's executive body and
a driving force in the 1992 project, has pressed for a more rapid
pace toward unity.
   In support of Delors' position, the EC official said: ``Quicker
integration is necessary to avoid dilution or weakening of the
community. The necessity to strengthen the community becomes
apparent.''
   Ludlow, director of the Brussels think tank, said: ``You've got
to go faster on Western European integration in order to stabilize
the Eastern situation.''
   West German officials, mindful of the concerns of their allies,
have reaffirmed their ties to the West in recent days.
   ``We have decided for Europe and we are an integrated part of
Europe,'' said Peter Pietsch, an economist at the Commerzbank in
Frankfurt. ``Nothing will change in this respect. The process of
European integration will not be affected.''
   A senior Dutch official said privately: ``West Germany has made
clear that there is no such choice'' between the Common Market and
reunification, and ``that is an encouraging signal.''
   The community's toughest and most controversial task in coming
months will be forging an economic and monetary union.
   France wants a common currency and central bank system
eventually, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain fears
that would force member nations to relinquish some sovereignty to
new institutions. Some West German officials favor a slower
approach than the French.
   According to the Dutch official, ``The Germans feel slightly
cornered. If they hesitate (on monetary union), they will be
accused of not participating in European integration.''
   Western Europe as a body has had limited experience of economic
dealings with the East.
   In June 1988, the community signed a declaration establishing
official relations with the Soviet-led economic bloc known as
Comecon, but nothing came of it.
   Since then, the Common Market has worked out broad trade and
economic cooperation agreements with Poland and Hungary, and a more
limited one with Czechoslovakia. Negotiations are under way with
the Soviet Union and preliminary, but not formal, talks have been
held with East Germany.
   Two dozen Western nations also have put the community in charge
of developing an overall economic package for Poland and Hungary,
which are moving toward democracy and free economies.
   Because of the closer ties, there is talk of a form of associate
EC membership for some East European countries.

   President F.W. de Klerk on
Thursday opened all beaches to blacks and promised to end racial
segregation of public facilities. Activist groups pressed him to
scrap apartheid completely.
   ``The time has arrived to repeal this act,'' de Klerk said,
referring to the Separate Amenities Act that his National Party put
into law in 1953.
   The act allows white local governments across the country to bar
blacks from parks, libraries, swimming pools, civic centers, buses
and public toilets.
   It cannot be repealed formally until Parliament reconvenes Feb.
2. De Klerk's declaration that all beaches will be open also
requires action by municipal and provincial authorities.
   In many communities, most or all public amenities are open to
all races. But whites-only facilities persist in the capital,
Pretoria, in many rural towns, and in several small industrial
cities where the far-right Conservative Party took power in
municipal elections last year.
   The proposed repeal of the Separate Amenities Act ``is the
beginning of the end of a separate white community life,'' said
Koos van der Merwe, chief spokesman for the Conservatives, who
urged whites to oust de Klerk.
   ``Mr. de Klerk is placing South Africa on the road of a totally
racially mixed South Africa, which will inevitably be governed by a
black majority.''
   Anti-apartheid groups urged de Klerk to grant more freedoms to
blacks. Lawyers for Human Rights said in a statement: ``We hope
that this is the first step under Mr. de Klerk towards absolute
equality for all people in South Africa and the restoration and
protection of many other rights which remain violated in terms of
South African law.''
   The Democratic Movement, a loose organization of anti-apartheid
groups, said de Klerk had no choice but to ease the restrictions
and criticized his gradual approach of granting reforms.
   ``When the president announced that blacks and whites can swim
together he does so not from a position of moral strength, but as
someone put on the defensive by historical imperatives,'' it said
in a statement.
   It said that the ``incrementalist approach of Mr. de Klerk's has
built into it the elements of a holding act on behalf of a system
which must just be scrapped altogether and not reformed.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said ``We sincerely hope that the South African government will
continue on this encouraging path.''
   The repeal would still leave major areas of segregation in South
Africa _ residential neighborhoods, medical care and public
education. It also would leave intact the political system that
gives the 5 million whites domination over the 32 million blacks,
Asians and people of mixed-race.
   The government is in the process of designating certain
neighborhoods as multiracial, although it says whites will retain
the option of living in segregated areas.
   De Klerk has given no signal that public schools and hospitals
will be integrated, nor hinted at repeal of the Population
Registration Act, which officially classifies all South Africans by
race.
   De Klerk, who took office in August, said his announcements were
``in line with our stated goal to eliminate discrimination.''
   They were the latest in a series of moves aimed at enhancing the
prospects for black-white negotiations on a new constitution that
would extend political rights to blacks while protecting white
interests.
   Among these moves:
   _ Eight prominent political prisoners, including seven leaders
of the outlawed African National Congress, were freed
unconditionally on Oct. 15.
   _ For the first time in years, the government has allowed mass
demonstrations and marches by anti-apartheid activists.
   _ De Klerk and other officials have sharply increased government
contacts with opposition leaders, holding meetings with nationally
known and local activists.
   Further, De Klerk has visited neighboring black nations and it
is widely believed that he will free Nelson Mandela, the jailed
leader of the ANC, earlier next year.
   ``For the white group, clinging to power means accepting the
risk of _ more than that, of facing _ a revolution,'' de Klerk said.
   Many beaches have been opened to all races in recent years, but
segregated beachfronts remain in the country's main resort city,
Durban, and several smaller resort communities.
   Durban's city council recently voted down a proposal to
integrate its last three whites-only beaches, but removed the
``whites-only'' warning signs.
   Durban Mayor Derek Watterson said he doubted de Klerk had the
authority to overturn the municipal law segregating city beaches,
but was pleased with the president's statement and had placed the
issue on the city council agenda for Monday.
   Chris Hattingh, mayor of the Strand, near Cape Town, where
police used whips to drive black and mixed-race people off the
city's beaches in late July, said he was happy about de Klerk's
statement and the council would address the issue Friday.

   The value of U.S. dairy, livestock and poultry
exports in the first half of 1989 was more than $3.6 billion, up 14
percent from the same period last year, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   Beef, pork, animal hair, live animals, leather and poultry meats
contributed to the increase, the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service said in a report.
   Animal fats, hides and skins were down slightly, the report
said. Both quantity and value of variety meats were down slightly
from a year earlier, due mostly to a sharp drop in shipments of
pork variety meats.
   In the category of dairy products, cheese and non-fat dry milk
declined 40 percent to 50 percent both in volume and value, the
report said. Butter exports nearly doubled in volume from a year
earlier, however, and were up more than 80 percent in value.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of festive people strutted on the
San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge today, commemorating the quick
repair job that will enable commuters to return to the span this
week for the first time since the earthquake.
   Celebrators paid $5 _ proceeds to quake relief _ to walk over
the bridge to within 100 yards of the 50-foot break on the upper
deck that had severed the vital link between San Francisco and the
East Bay on Oct. 17. One motorist died.
   They couldn't walk all the way across because some of the
concrete was still in the final stages of hardening, officials said.
   ``I was on a bus when the bridge broke, about 150 yards from
where it broke,'' recalled Susan Palumbo, 42, of San Francisco, as
she stood on the bridge today. ``We had to get off the bus and walk
to Treasure Island and then to San Francisco.''
   ``It was scary. I didn't feel the quake, but I waited for the
aftershock to take the bridge down. I feel safe now,'' she said.
   The 53-year-old bridge, one of the world's most heavily
traveled, is scheduled to reopen at 11:59 p.m. Friday, said Bob
Halligan of the California Department of Transportation.
   Gov. George Deukmejian and Mayors Art Agnos and Lionel Wilson of
San Francisco and Oakland, respectively, were among the dignitaries
on the program for today's ceremony near the site of the collapse.
   In the early stages of the repair, state Department of
Transportation officials said they hoped to have the bridge
reopened by Thanksgiving. Denny McLeod, a contractor, said planning
alone for such a job usually would take a month.
   Samuel Skinner, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation,
congratulated Caltrans after observing the final stages of repair
work on Tuesday and said, ``We've beaten the bureaucracy on this
one.''
   Some local officials grumbled about today's ceremony, saying the
bridge could have been opened to cars today insteady of Saturday.
   Officials expect the usual traffic backups come Monday morning
when motorists pay their $1 tolls to cross.
   In recent weeks damage has been detected in many of the approach
ramps on either side of the bridge, so delays aren't likely to end.
   ``There are going to be tremendous traffic problems for at least
a year because of earthquake damage,'' said state Assemblyman Tom
Bates of Oakland. ``It seems like an excellent time to get
reliable, timely public transportation in place.''
   Bates plans to call for a toll increase, to at least $2, when
the legislature reconvenes in January.
   The bridge was carrying an average of more than 260,000 vehicles
every working day before the quake. It opened on Nov. 12, 1936.
   In the past month, commuters who normally drove the bridge to
work had to use alternate routes, longer and much slower because of
increased traffic.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which has an underground tube
below the Bay, has set records during the bridge closure, with as
many as 345,000 passengers riding BART trains some days.
   For the bridge repair, the first step was to make sure the
damaged decks didn't fall through to the bay. Working around the
clock, crews cut the damaged upper deck into two pieces, then used
a crane to lower them to a barge below.
   Other steps involved installing new girders, placing 20 new
I-beams, lowering 42 precast deck sections and pouring concrete
between them.
   Skinner said he hoped people who used mass transit during the
closure would stick with it.
   ``The nation can't afford the single occupant vehicle,'' he said.

   A Korean-born Presbyterian minister condemned
by some conservatives for calling for the reunification of his
homeland was chosen Thursday as president-elect of the National
Council of Churches.
   ``By faith, I have been able to overcome the past, hatred,
hostility, and begin to see the new reality of reconciliation, in
particular the situation in Korea,'' the Rev. Syngman Rhee said
after being named to the No. 2 post in America's biggest ecumenical
organization.
   The council's 273-member governing board, gathered here for its
twice-yearly meeting, unanimously elected Rhee, the sole nominee
for the post.
   Rhee will assume office Jan. 1 and become president in 1992,
succeeding the Very Rev. Leonid Kishkovsky, an archpriest of the
Orthodox Church in America in Syosset, N.Y.
   Thirty-two Protestant, Orthodox and Anglican denominations
constitute the council, with a combined membership of 42 million
Christians.
   Rhee, 58, associate director of the global mission unit for the
Presbyterian Church (USA) in Louisville, fled to South Korea in
1950 after his father was slain by the communists.
   He served for five years in the South Korean military before
coming to the United States in 1956.
   There was no sign at Thursday's meeting of Rhee's primary
critic, the Presbyterian Lay Committee. The conservative
organization, which seeks to de-emphasize political involvement by
the Presbyterian Church (USA), has questioned Rhee's motive in
calling for the reunification of North and South Korea.
   The Presbyterian Lay Committee's president was out of town
Thursday and unavailable for comment, said the Rev. George Booker,
a consultant at the group's office in Springfield, Pa.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city that boasts the world's largest Polish
population after Warsaw on Thursday prepared a joyous welcome for
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   ``Next to the pope's visit here, it's the biggest thing that's
happened,'' said Anthony Piwowarczyk, vice president of the Polish
National Alliance.
   ``There's no question about it,'' said Roman Pucinski, a city
alderman and president of the local Polish American Congress. ``The
two top figures of the world today, the pope and Walesa, are both
Polish.''
   Signs depicting Walesa were taped to store windows up and down a
section of Milwaukee Avenue, center of the city's Polish community.
``Solidarnosc: A labor leader who is changing the world,'' read
one, urging attendance at a rally Saturday in Walesa's honor.
Another read simply: ``The Man.''
   As many as 50,000 people are expected at the rally, including
thousands of children from Polish ``Saturday Schools,'' schools in
Polish language, history and culture. It is Walesa's only public
appearance in Chicago, with private meetings occupying most of the
rest of his one-day visit.
   When asked about Walesa, Wojciech Cioromski immediately pulled
two invitations from his breast pocket _ one to a Saturday
breakfast and the second to a lunch honoring the labor leader.
   ``Absolutely. They are waiting for Walesa,'' said Cioromski of
Chicago Poles as he drank coffee and chain-smoked European
cigarettes at the Orbit Restaurant, across the street from Klub
Ameryka.
   ``Everybody wants to see him _ but he spends minutes here,'' he
said.
   Walesa will be in Chicago slightly more than 24 hours after he
arrives Friday, and the demands for his time have been monumental.
   ``They are calling Solidarity headquarters in Gdansk, asking him
to attend weddings, birthday parties, anything you can imagine,''
said Pucinski, who met with Walesa while in Poland earlier this
month. ``He said to me, `It would be easier for me to go to the
moon than go to Chicago.'''
   Some 800,000 Poles live in the Chicago area, more than in any
other city but Warsaw, said Piwowarczyk.
   While some along Milwaukee Avenue said they were saddened Walesa
would spend none of his time in the heart of the Polish community,
most said they understood.
   ``He's not going to be going by in everybody's little
delicatessen,'' said Peter Bacik, whose father owns Bacik's
Delicatessen. ``But we appreciate what he is doing _ we are all for
it.''
   ``It's been something,'' Bacik reflected while standing among
customers eyeing rows of hanging sausages. ``They are watching the
news, listening to Polish radio stations. Polish people are finally
coming out of the dark ages.''

<HEAD>Fairness Of Disability Rules Questioned</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawmakers questioned eligibility rules for the
nation's $19 billion-a-year disability insurance program Thursday,
after a congressional study found that many people being rejected
are often in as bad shape as those receiving benefits.
   More than half of a sample of applicants denied benefits under
the Social Security Disability Insurance Program are not working,
80 percent perceive their health as fair to poor, and 61 percent
had total family income below the Census Bureau's poverty level,
according to the General Accounting Office study.
   Among those rejected, according to a supplement to the study
prepared by the Senate Special Committee on Aging, was a man
disabled when a steel beam fell on him during a welding accident in
1979.
   Dale White, 54, of Carlisle, Pa., told the study's researchers
that he limps, can only walk short distances, lost sight in one
eye, can lift only small objects and has difficulty concentrating
for more than 10 minutes at a time. But, according to the
supplement, White was told that ``since he has two good arms and
can lift small objects, he could put nuts and bolts in a factory,
or he could be a security guard.''
   GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, asked the Census Bureau
to interview 3,000 people who either were recipients or former
recipients of disability benefits in 1987, or whose applications
were turned down.
   About 1 million people apply each year for benefits under SSDI,
and about 30 percent are awarded benefits. The program, which paid
more than $19 billion to 4 million beneficiaries in the last fiscal
year, is the nation's main source of income replacement for
disabled workers.
   The survey results ``on the surface, appear to raise some
questions as to the accuracy of the Social Security
Administration's disability criteria and determination process in
judging a disability applicant's ability to work,'' said the GA0.
   ``A significant proportion of denied applicants were not
working, and their self-reported health limitations appeared to be
similar to those of program beneficiaries,'' it said.
   The study was requested by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., ranking
minority member of the Senate aging committee, and Rep. Andrew
Jacobs, D-Ind., chairman of the House Ways and Means subcommittee
on Social Security.
   Jacobs and Heinz said after the study was released Thursday that
the program's eligibility standards should be reviewed.
   To qualify for benefits, a person insured under Social Security
must be unable to perform ``any kind of substantial gainful
activity that exists in the national economy,'' according to the
GAO. The Social Security Administration has developed a list of
impairments _ for example, blindness _ considered severe enough to
automatically warrant benefits.
   Mental and heart problems were the most common ailments among
those receiving benefits, the GAO said. The report said the
rejected applicants most often reported back problems.
   Social Security Administration spokesman Phil Gambino said the
agency is considering personal interviews with applicants. He said
Administrator Gwendolyn King vowed when she assumed the post
earlier this year to ``promote fairness, equity and responsiveness
through all our policies, practices and decisions in the disability
program.''

<HEAD>100,000 Bid Farewell to Fiery Communist Leader</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Spaniards and
Communists from 78 countries bade farewell Thursday to Dolores
Ibarruri, ``La Pasionaria,'' whose fiery oratory rallied Republican
forces during the Spanish civil war.
   An estimated 100,000 people crowded around the downtown Plaza
Colon for the 20-minute ceremony, with many waving red flags and
raising clenched fists in honor of Mrs. Ibarruri, who died Sunday
at the age of 93.
   Mourners shouted ``No pasaran!'' _ ``They shall not pass!'' _ a
phrase she made famous as a deputy in Parliament when nationalists
under Gen. Francisco Franco rose up against the Second Republic to
set off the 1936-39 conflict.
   The crowd followed the hearse bearing Mrs. Ibarruri's coffin
from Communist Party headquarters to the plaza.
   ``Times change, then and now, and you knew how to match your
Communist militancy to new moments and situations,'' said Spanish
Communist Party General Secretary Julio Anguita in his eulogy.
``But you never went back on your principles _ nor did the Spanish
Communist Party.''
   Both Mrs. Ibarruri and the party she headed for several decades
embraced the Eurocommunist movement.
   The cortege left the plaza and headed for a municipal cemetery
for burial next to Pablo Iglesias, founder of the ruling Socialist
Party.
   More than 50,000 people paid their last respects to the
legendary leader during the three days she lay in state in party
headquarters, officials said.
   Officials from Communist parties in the Soviet Union, Cuba,
France, Italy, Nicaragua and Czechoslovakia, among others, took
turns in five-minute vigils around the casket as people filed by.
   Many of the mourners raised their fists in salute, others tossed
flowers at the foot of the bier, still others knelt and cried.
   At least 600 buses brought mourners into Madrid for the funeral,
according to the party officials.
   Visitors included U.S. and Canadian veterans of the
International Brigades that fought alongside Republican troops in
the 1936-39 war, the officials said.
   Mrs. Ibarruri, who began her career as a labor organizer and
strike leader, wrote articles signed ``La Pasionaria.'' She chose
the name in 1916 when her first article appeared during Holy Week,
the time of the Christ's passion.
   She went into exile in the Soviet Union when the Second Republic
fell to Franco's forces and only returned to Spain in 1977, two
years after his death.
   She was one of the first women elected to Parliament in Spain
and served as deputy during the Second Republic as well as in that
of the constitutional monarchy established after Franco's death.
   Political leaders said her death signaled the end of the
divisive era in Spanish history symbolized by the war.

<TEXT>
   The nation's governors and the president of
the American Federation of Teachers gave conditional support
Thursday to a bill that would allow schools more flexibility in
exchange for improved learning by students.
   ``I know some people fear change,'' New Jersey Gov. Thomas H.
Kean told a subcommittee of the House Education and Labor Committee.
   ``Providing a quality education today entails taking risks. ...
This bill commits school districts to higher academic achievement
in return for flexibility in dealing with federal and state
regulations,'' said Kean. ``It's a trade of professional freedom
for accountability.''
   The bill, introduced by Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., would make the
program voluntary and stipulate that participation would be
canceled if student achievements worsen within two years.
   Kean submitted a statement from the National Governors'
Association that praised the ``concept and policy direction'' of
the legislation but said the measure needs more work in clearly
stating the financing and monitoring arrangements.
   AFT President Albert Shanker stressed that the performance goals
should be clearly defined as well as how achievements will be
assessed.
   But Shanker added, ``I think the overall framework of getting
people at the local level to come up with some new ideas and
planning, getting commitment on the part of all the constitutents,
combining sums of money ... I think the entire framework is
excellent.''
   Opposing the bill, the committee chairman, Rep. Augustus
Hawkins, D-Calif., told the hearing by the Subcommittee on
Elementary, Secondary and Vocational Education that the measure may
set a ``dangerous trend.'' He reminded committee members of the
initial problems with the federal Chapter One program for
disadvantaged children.
   ``We found that Chapter One was being expended _ even though it
was getting positive results _ for football fields, for swimming
pools, for faculty lounges and so forth and not for the academic
improvement of the children,'' said Hawkins. ``So we had to come
back 15 to 20 times'' and insert protections in the law.
   Hawkins also noted that Congress got involved in education
``because of the neglect that we found.''
   ``We had to legislate to get handicapped kids into the
classroom. We had to legislate on the federal level to get
disadvantaged children who were picking crops back into the
classroom. We've had to go through this process. It worries me what
regulations are going to be suspended or altered,'' he said.
   Smith, an educator and former Vermont lieutenant governor,
introduced the bill days before the historic education summit that
concluded with an agreement that national performance goals would
be developed and federal regulations tied to key education programs
would be loosened.
   ``The summit, and the attention it commanded, have given us an
extraordinary opportunity here in Congress to work with the
administration and the governors toward a national policy that will
restructure our public school system for the better,'' Smith told
the subcommittee.
   Smith said the bill was written in direct response to complaints
of educators that ``quality education has suffered as government
rules and regulations have stiffened.''
   ``It is offered as both a solution and a challenge, because it
basically says to our educators, if you can do better with fewer
rules and regulations, prove it,'' he said.
   Smith said the bill also stresses that the civil rights of
students ``in no way, shape or form can be abridged.''

<HEAD>Gov't Company Fires Hundreds More Strikers, Clashes Injure Six</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police clashed with striking
black workers Thursday and the government-run transport company
fired hundreds more employees demanding nearly 2{ times their
current pay.
   Police said six officers were hurt in two clashes.
   The South African Transport Services said it fired 800 strikers
after dropping 626 from the payroll earlier this week. The company
said the walkout is illegal because rail, trucking and harbor
operations are designated as essential.
   Police headquarters said violence broke out at a railway station
in Germiston, near Johannesburg, when about 50 strikers arrived by
train for a union meeting without having paid their rail fares.
   Officers moved in to arrest the men and were attacked with
sticks, whips and stones, police said. Strikers scattered after
officers fired two pistol shots, according to police, who said
three officers were injured.
   An hour later, three more officers were hurt trying to disperse
about 150 strikers outside a union office in Germiston, according
to police headquarters. No arrests were reported in either incident.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, with which the
transport union is affiliated, said police ``indiscriminately
attacked'' the workers when they got off the train without paying.
   The statement by the congress, the country's largest and most
militantly anti-apartheid trade federation, said police ``brutally
assaulted'' the strikers when they fled to the union offices. The
union said the workers were unable to pay for their train tickets
because they were on strike.
   The dispute centers on a demand by the South African Railways
and Harbor Workers for the minimum wage to be increased to $570 a
month from $230. Other issues in dispute are the union's objection
to possible privatization and the company's refusal to officially
recognize the union.
   The union claims a membership of 40,000 of the total 180,000
black workers employed by the transport company.
   The strike, which has hit mainly the Johannesburg-Pretoria area
and the port city of Durban, is one of two bitter labor disputes
that show no signs of resolution.
   About 6,000 black employees of South African Breweries, the
country's privately owned beer monopoly, have been on strike for
five weeks.
   On Wednesday, the brewery workers' union lowered its wage demand
for the first time, saying it would accept a 32 percent increase
instead of a 38 percent increase. But management maintained its
refusal to change its ``final'' offer of a 16 percent raise.
   Seven deaths have been linked to that strike.
   Police officials also said Thursday that 15 black activists were
arrested for participating in an illegal meeting in Alexandra, a
township adjoining Johannesburg. The meeting followed the
announcement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission for
a protest march in Alexandra on Saturday.
   Organizers hoped 30,000 would join the march to demand new
housing, an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accrued
during a three-year rent boycott.

   Members of Congress are warning President Bush
that reported plans to slash federal support for such
high-technology initiatives as robots and advanced computer chips
would be ``economic insanity'' and doom America's consumer
electronics industry.
   ``Eliminating America's few strategic technology initiatives
will cause permanent damage to both our defense and commercial
industrial bases,'' said a bipartisan group of four legislators in
a letter sent to Bush late Wednesday.
   White House spokesman Steven Hart had no comment on the letter,
which said Bush administration officials are circulating documents
that call for drastically reducing contracts and programs of the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   The programs, they said, include high-definition television
known as HDTV and X-ray lithography, a technology needed to make
advanced computer chips.
   They also include the Defense Department's manufacturing
technology program, which is aimed at developing robots and other
computer-assisted equipment.
   The letter said the administration also is reported to be
considering a cutoff of support for Sematech, an
industry-government consortium that aims to regain U.S. leadership
in semiconductor manufacturing by 1993. Sematech receives $100
million annually from the government.
   ``Cutting, if not completely eliminating, any of the programs in
question would be economic insanity,'' said the letter signed by
Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa.; House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt,
D-Mo., and Democratic Reps. Mel Levine and Norman Y. Mineta of
California.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on science, technology and space, also criticized the
reported cutbacks Thursday in a separate letter to Bush.
   ``I find it hard to believe that you would personally
countenance actions so short-sighted and so damaging,'' Gore wrote.
   Gore wrote his Senate colleagues a letter saying he had been
informed that ``orders have been given to terminate all work in the
Defense Department on HDTV and that the Defense Department should
now prepare to rely upon the Japanese as suppliers for our
military's needs in this field.''
   The Tennessee Democrat said he also heard that ``ideologists''
are urging the administration ``to cancel Sematech and other
consortia that bring the federal government into cooperation with
the private sector on critical technological work.''
   If this happens, Gore wrote, ``the administration will have
sanctioned and encouraged the complete and irrevocable demise of
the American consumer electronics industry and signaled that it
also intends to allow the machine tool industry _ already badly
damaged by foreign competition _ to suffer a similar fate.''
   Gore's letter to Bush, dated Nov. 1, accompanied a report by the
National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors, which the White
House has not released.
   In the letter, the advisory committee's chairman, Ian M. Ross,
president of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories, contended that ``the
semiconductor industry in the United States is in serious trouble.''
   Ross told Bush that ``if this vital industry is allowed to
wither away, the nation will pay a price measured in millions of
jobs across the entire electronics field, technological leadership
in many allied industries such as telecommunications and computers,
and the technical edge we depend on for national security.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Describing socialism as a ``total
failure,'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Thursday the East Germans
must decide for themselves whether to unite with West Germany.
   The Soviet Union is firmly opposed to German reunification, and
some Western countries are nervous about the idea.
   But Kohl told a raucous parliamentary session that the East
Germans should be allowed to make up their own minds.
   ``They don't need any lectures from one side or another. They
know best what they want. That pertains also to German unity, to
the question of reunification,'' he said.
   Parliament erupted into a verbal free-for-all as lawmakers and
officials from Kohl's governing coalition exchanged barbs with the
opposition about Kohl's responses to events in East Germany
following the opening of the Communist country's borders and a
series of other reforms.
   The chancellor said West Germany would ``respect every decision
made by the people of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)
in free self-determination.''
   Kohl added: ``He who does not want to make decisions for our
people should not try to persuade them the best thing is a division
of our fatherland.''
   He said West Germany's call for sweeping economic reform in East
Germany was not an example of meddling, but a recognition of
disastrous results from communist rule.
   ``We don't want to impose our ideas on anyone,'' he said. ``But
no one can seriously dispute that socialism has proven itself to be
a total failure. Everywhere in the world, not just in the GDR (East
Germany), it has failed.''
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev insists that sweeping changes in the
Communist world are not an admission that socialism was a mistake.
The Soviet president also has warned the West not to gloat over
what would seem like its victory in the Cold War.
   Gorbachev on Wednesday said talk about reunification ``would
mean interference in the affairs'' of East Germany and West Germany.
   On Thursday, Soviet Central Committee adviser Nikolai Portugalov
said reunification won't happen even in the long-term future.
   ``Reunification in the form in which certain rightists and
nationalists in the Federal Republic (West Germany) envision it
doesn't fit in the concept of the German states, neither East or
West,'' Portugalov told the Soviet news agency Novosti.
   ``Therefore I think that for the forseeable future and also in
the long term two German states will exist with one another, not
against one another, as sovereign and equal.''
   West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper accused Kohl of dragging his
feet in offers of help for East Germany and demanded that financial
aid not be linked to a complete overhaul of the Communist nation's
economy.
   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, interrupted Momper and
said to him angrily: ``Do you really think that in this hour of
history your attack is really appropriate?''
   In his speech, Momper also said East Germans want ``no meddling
in the formation of their society'' and contended most aren't
interested in the question of German reunification.
   Renewed interest in possible German reunification has followed
East Germany's decision a week ago to open its borders, including
the Berlin Wall. Built in 1961 to prevent citizens from fleeing,
the wall was a symbol of East-West division.
   Kohl offered to make desperately needed doctors and medical
assistance available to East Germany but said fundamental changes
in its political and economic system remains crucial to Bonn's
plans for ``a fully new dimension of help and cooperation.''

   The General Services Administration is
investigating International Business Machines Corp.'s sale to the
government of used computer equipment marked as new, GSA officials
said Thursday.
   IBM says it told the GSA about the problems two years ago.
   The investigation by the agency's inspector general is also
trying to determine if IBM violated the Buy American Act by
incorrectly certifying that more than half the components of some
products it sold the government were made in America.
   Audits of three computer contacts, each worth $700 million to
$800 million a year, are being conducted by the inspector general
of GSA, officials told the House Government Operations national
security subcommittee.
   ``It appears that IBM has violated the terms of its contracts
with the government and may have violated federal law,'' Assistant
Inspector General Edward F. Hefferon told the subcommittee.
   Company spokesman Mark Holcomb said the company had no intention
of trying to deceive the government and reported the problems to
GSA two years ago.
   ``Discussion of criminal and administrative penalties is simply
not appropriate to the facts,'' he said. ``There was simply no
intent to deceive the government.''
   But investigators are reviewing the contracts to determine if
there is any evidence of a willful intent by IBM to deceive the
government, said Karen Shaffer, a spokeswoman for the inspector
general's office.
   ``If we find something that warrants civil or criminal action,
we refer it to the Justice Department and they make the case,'' she
said.
   No referrals have been made to the Justice Department but the
investigation is continuing, she said.
   Holcomb said the false certification that some of the products
were new was inadvertent and the result of a computer program error.
   The sale of used equipment or products largely made with foreign
components accounted for only a small percentage of the three
contracts, which ran from 1984 through 1988, he said.
   Used equipment sold to the government had been reconditioned and
worked as if it were new, Holcomb said. IBM offered to pay $1.5
million to cover penalties for selling used equipment to the
government.
   Hefferon said GSA auditors are looking at the three contracts
``so that we can assure ourselves that all sales transactions were
adequately considered.''
   ``No settlement will be considered until all the facts
surrounding this situation have been carefully developed and
reviewed,'' Hefferon said.
   A customer's query led to IBM's discovery that it couldn't
certify that some of the products sold the government were
``domestic-end use'' as required by the Buy American Act, Holcomb
said.
   ``With the growth of world-wide sources'' of computer components
``it is increasingly difficult for venders to certify country of
origin,'' Holcomb said. ``We went back and looked at the process
that was used to track the literally billions of components that go
into primary low-end products'' such as printers and work stations.
   ``We did not have enough information in some cases to be able to
certify'' that half the parts were U.S.-made, Holcomb said. ``When
we found that in our own internal review, we disclosed it to GSA.''
   Hefferon said that IBM has been cooperating with the review and
GSA has asked for additional information. ``While some of this
information has been furnished by IBM, we are still waiting for a
substantial portion of data.''
   ``Our experience has been that IBM as a very large bureaucracy
is very slow to respond,'' Hefferon said. ``In general, however,
they have maintained a cooperative attitude.''

   An elementary school cafeteria wall
collapsed early this afternoon during a wind and rain storm,
killing at least seven children, authorities said.
   Faye Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the Valley Central School
District, confirmed the deaths and said 18 other students were
injured. She said rescue workers pulled many children from under
the rubble at East Coldenham Elementary School.
   Wind toppled a tree and sent it crashing through the wall of a
cafeteria where pupils were eating about 12:30 p.m., said Carole
Armstrong, a school district secretary.
   The school is about five miles west of Newburgh, a city of about
23,000 people located about 60 miles north of New York City.
   Officials with the State Emergency Management Office could not
immediately confirm reports that a tornado hit the school, said
Gary Fryer, a spokesman for Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The Newburgh area and metropolitan New York were covered this
afternoon by a tornado watch posted by the National Weather Service
for large parts of the East Coast from Maryland to New England.
   A more urgent tornado warning was posted for Westchester County,
one of the counties between New York and Newburgh.
   The storm was part of a band of severe thunderstorms crossing
the Northeast today.

<HEAD>Cuomo Wants Poles to Learn About Democracy From Abe Lincoln</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC HUMBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo plans a new book about
Abraham Lincoln that will translate the Gettysburg Address so
Polish school children can learn about government ``of the people,
by the people and for the people.''
   Instead of memorizing the words ``Four score and seven years
ago,'' Polish children may learn ``Osiemdziesiat siedem lat temu
...''
   Cuomo was to announce plans for the book, to be published in
English and Polish, at a meeting Friday with Lech Walesa at an
AFL-CIO-sponsored breakfast in New York City.
   Cuomo also planned to present a bust of Lincoln to Walesa,
founder of the Polish labor union Solidarity that brought sweeping
democratic reforms to his country.
   The unusual book project, for which Cuomo is writing an
introduction, stemmed from a visit this summer by a group of
teachers from Poland, the first Soviet bloc country in 40 years to
hold free elections and form a non-Communist government.
   They asked the governor how to teach their students about
democracy, and Cuomo told them to study Lincoln's writings. Told by
the teachers that there was no such work in Polish, Cuomo promised
to help correct that.
   ``A day after he found out there was no such book in Poland, he
found there was such book in this country either,'' said Cuomo aide
Harold Holzer. ``He thought we could just go out and buy the book
and have it translated.''
   Cuomo and Holzer began rounding up Lincoln scholars and money to
produce such a book. Eventually, said Holzer, more than 40 Lincoln
scholars volunteered their time. Seven are writing essays for the
book.
   Polish-born poet and novelist Czeslaw Milosz, winner of the 1980
Nobel Prize for Literature, agreed to translate the Gettysburg
Address into Polish. Holzer is hoping that the State University of
New York at Stony Brook's Institute for Translation will take care
of the rest.
   Seed money for the project came from the New York Telephone Co.,
the Forbes Foundation, the American Federation of Teachers and the
New York State United Teachers.
   The book will be published next November by Cornelia and Michael
Bessie Books, a division of Harper &amp; Row, said editor Amy Gash.
   The second chapter of what some Cuomo aides have dubbed the
``Lech-Lincoln connection'' comes Sunday when the New York Democrat
goes to Gettysburg, Pa., to be the featured speaker at ceremonies
marking the 126th anniversary of Lincoln's famous speech.
   Billing the governor's own Gettysburg address as a major speech,
Holzer said it would deal with democracy in Eastern Europe and the
question of ``who are the true heirs of Lincoln _ the Democrats or
the Republicans?''
   Cuomo's speech will come at the annual ceremony at the
Gettysburg cemetery, dedicated by Lincoln after the battle that
what was the turning point of the Civil War.
   Previous speakers have included poet Carl Sandburg and Illinois
Gov. James Thompson. Last year, U.S. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist was the main speaker.

<HEAD>President Rejects Attempt in Congress to Pardon Drug Traffickers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Virgilio Barco's government
opposes an attempt in Colombia's congress to pardon drug
traffickers, newspapers reported Thursday.
   During debate in congress Wednesday, Justice Minister Roberto
Salazar said Barco is steadfastly opposed to giving amnesty to the
Medellin Cartel members and other cocaine traffickers, reported the
dailies El Espectador and El Tiempo.
   Barco has no veto power over legislation and if the congress
should decide to approve the amnesty bill, it would become law.
   However, there is little doubt the Supreme Court would declare
such a law unconstitutional. The constitution clearly reserves
pardons for political crimes while forbidding amnesty for common
criminals.
   Rep. Cesar Perez is proposing that amnesty for traffickers be
made part of a bill that would offer amnesty to leftist guerrillas
who signed a truce with the government.
   Perez said in a speech to the congress Wednesday that the
minister of justice was ignorant because of his opposition to
amnesty for drug traffickers.
   Colombia's congress has not been enthusiastic over the
government's war on drug traffickers declared by Barco Aug. 19
after traffickers killed a popular presidential hopeful, Sen. Luis
Carlos Galan.
   Barco issued decrees allowing the extradition of traffickers to
the United States and the confiscation of their property in
Colombia.
   Attacks blamed on drug thugs since the government offensive
began have left at least 39 people dead and 226 injured.
   Several members of congress have been accused in the last 10
years of accepting money from drug traffickers, but the accusations
have never been proven. The suspected head of the Medellin Cartel,
Pablo Escobar, was a member of congress from 1982 to 1986.
   Several congressmen have expressed support for amnesty for drug
traffickers, but because most are keeping their opinions to
themselves there is no way to tell if amnesty for traffickers might
be approved.
   Debate on the bill is expected to end within the next two weeks.
   The proposed amnesty for guerrillas came in a peace treaty with
the April 19 Movement, known as the M-19. Few in congress have
spoken out against the government's attempt to reach a peace with
the guerrillas.
   In exchange for pardons and the right to form a political party,
the M-19 has agreed to give up its weapons and disband.
   Four other guerrilla groups have expressed interest in opening
talks with the government, but so far no other talks have taken
place. A sixth guerrilla group, the National Liberation Army, has
said it will never negotiate with the government.

<TEXT>
   Here are some of the questions posed by the
members of the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday to Navy
officials who conducted the investigation into the April 19
explosion aboard the battleship Iowa, and some of the replies they
received:
   _Does the Navy have proof the explosion was caused by gunner's
mate Clayton Hartwig?
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, author of the Navy's report, said
the Navy has ``forensic evidence'' that Hartwig was the gun captain
on the day of the explosion, and that he was the one who
``controlled the loading'' of the 16-inch gun, which was rammed 21
inches further up the barrel than it should have been. Hartwig had
the ability to construct an explosive device and the opportunity to
put it in the gun, the admiral said.
   Milligan cited as other evidence an FBI psychological profile of
Hartwig that he said suggested the sailor ``took his own life in
hopes it would look like an accident.''
   _But Hartwig didn't know he was to be in the turret until
several hours before the blast.
   Milligan said the sailor was upset over the breakup of a
friendship with another sailor, had discussed suicide and did have
those hours of notice. He noted that superiors who assigned Hartwig
to replace another sailor in the turret also died in the blast.
   _Aren't there other possible causes for such an explosion?
   The admiral said his investigation and the Navy's 20,000
technical tests of the gunpowder and charge ruled out numerous
other possibilties, such as a spark from a burning ember or the
ship's electrical system, friction during the loading of the gun
barrel, or contamination of the gunpowder during its years of
storage.
   _Could the ``foreign matter'' found on the projectile, a key to
the Navy's conclusion that someone probably used a detonator, have
gotten there at some other time?
   Milligan said the material was embedded in the copper ring of
the projectile by the fierce power of the explosion, and could not
have gotten there when the shell was forcibly removed from the gun
barrel following the explosion.
   _Given the safety and training problems aboard the Iowa,
couldn't they have played a part in the explosion?
   Milligan admitted that there were ``major problems'' in the
administration of the ship and that the sailors in the gun turret
had not completed the proper procedures to prove that they were
competent to work in those positions, but the admiral said those
problems didn't cause the blast.
   _Doesn't a recent series of deadly accidents give rise to doubts
about the Navy's training and the leadership of its commanders?
   The Navy's top admiral, Carlisle A.H. Trost, told the committee
that steps have been taken to make sure that the lapses in
procedure aboard the Iowa have been corrected throughout the fleet,
and that he ordered a Navywide safety inspection to make sure that
proper procedures are being followed.

Lazio, the 1889 oil painting valued at $8.5 million will remain at
the National Gallery of Modern Art in Rome.
   The ownership dispute dates to 1977 when Ernst Beyeler, an art
collector from Basel, Switzerland, bought the painting for 600
million lire _ about $1 million then _ from an Italian nobleman.
   The painting remained in Italian museums and Beyeler tried to
sell it last year to the Guggenheim Collection, one of the most
renowned modern art galleries in Europe. The sale price was $8.5
million.
   The Italian Culture Ministry, however, blocked the sale. It
charged Beyeler's 1977 purchase of the painting was illegal, saying
it was bought in another person's name. The ministry said Beyeler
was not the legal owner and that the government had rights to the
painting.
   Beyeler took the case to court, which ruled against him
Thursday. The court will announce the reasons for its ruling later.
   Guggenheim officials were not involved in the court case.
   The court ruling means the state can buy the painting at the
1977 price, now equivalent to $444,000. However, an official
familiar with the case said another court could adjust the price
for inflation, putting the sales tag at about $1.5 million.
   The painting has been in Italy since 1910 and is considered by
the government part of the country's artistic patrimony.
   In 1977, an attempt was made to illegally export the painting
from Italy.
   The painting, a half-length portrait of a peasant in a sun hat,
has been kept in the basement of the Rome museum since 1987 pending
clarification of its ownership.

   A State Department official said Thursday that
U.S. consular officials want to question the California woman who
for a time was thought kidnapped by terrorists in Lebanon.
   Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said West German authorities had
conveyed word that Deborah Fahrend and two West German citizens
were ``free and safe.''
   ``We don't know for sure'' whether they were kidnapped, Miss
Tutwiler said. ``They have told the Germans that they were robbed,
not kidnapped.''
   Reports from Lebanon said the trio had gone by ferry to Larnaca,
Cyprus.
   ``Our consular officer, wherever she surfaces, will definitely
want to have a little _ meet her,'' said Miss Tutwiler, ending her
sentence on a different note.
   She said that a privacy law prevented her from discussing Mrs.
Fahrend's passport, but she emphasized it is against the law to use
a U.S. passport to travel to Lebanon without a special validation.
   She said no American citizen to date has been prosecuted for
such passport violations, ``but there are a number of cases under
consideration for prosecution right now.''
   After outlining what the State Department knew of the Fahrend
case, Miss Tutwiler added:
   ``The Lebanon travel advisory states that the situation in
Lebanon is so dangerous for Americans that no U.S. citizen can be
considered safe from terrorist acts.''
   She noted that U.S. embassy personnel were evacuated last Sept.
6 and said, ``without a special validation, U.S. passports remain
invalid for travel to, in, or through Lebanon.''
   Lebanon and Libya are the only two countries on which the United
States has placed such stringent travel restrictions.
   So far this year, Miss Tutwiler said, U.S. officials have
granted only 15 such passport validations for travel to war-torn
Lebanon. It validates passports for journalists, for Red Cross or
humanitarian purposes, or for trips ``in the U.S. national
interest,'' she said.
   Mrs. Fahrend, 54, had no connection with the U.S. government,
she added.
   Mrs. Fahrend, a registered nurse formerl of San Francisco, had
been living in West Berlin in recent years. She reportedly
described herself as a ``publisher-journalist'' and gone to Lebanon
to write a book on what she called ``a chance in a lifetime.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced to
reporters flying with President Bush to Houston earlier Thursday
that Mrs. Fahrend and her two companions had turned up.
   Eighteen foreigners are held in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   The government on Thursday proposed voluntary
record-keeping standards for employers so workers get credit for
all their wages when Social Security benefits are calculated.
   ``It is simply unacceptable for anyone to receive less than
their entitled Social Security benefits because their wages were,
at some point in their career, improperly recorded,'' Social
Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King said.
   The Social Security Administration believes the new voluntary
computer software standards could help employers more accurately
report wage and tax information to SSA and the Internal Revenue
Service.
   If an employee does not get proper credit for his or her wages,
it could result in lower Social Security benefits. Under the
current system, an estimated 10 percent of employer wage reports
contain inaccuracies or discrepancies that government workers must
try to resolve.
   The General Accounting Office last year reported that between
1978 and 1983, employers reported $58.8 billion less earnings to
Social Security than to IRS, and that little was being done to
reduce a growing backlog of unresolved cases.
   Social Security spokesman Phil Gambino said all those cases have
since been closed, with differences successfully resolved in
two-thirds of them. For 1984-87, about three-fourths of problem
cases have been resolved, and all should be completed by next year,
he said.
   The work has resulted in the crediting of $84 billion in wages
for 1979-87, Gambino said.
   ``In recent years, SSA has struggled mightily to attempt to
reconcile these errors after the reporting fact,'' Mrs. King said.
``Now, we want to correct the problem at the employer level ...
before differences occur.''
   Employers are being asked to comment on the draft guidelines
before a final version of the voluntary standards is issued.
   Workers themselves can help verify the accuracy of their
earnings record by obtaining a Personalized Earnings and Benefit
Estimate Statement from Social Security which contains a
year-by-year display of their earnings from 1951 through the most
recent year. Applications for the statements can be obtained by
contacting local Social Security offices or by calling
1-800-234-5772.

   Engineers installed a borrowed
electrical control unit in space shuttle Discovery on Thursday, and
NASA said it was proceeding on a tight schedule toward a
Thanksgiving Eve launch.
   Discovery's five astronauts will deploy a classified Pentagon
satellite, reportedly to eavesdrop on military and diplomatic
communications.
   The launch had been scheduled for next Monday night but was
postponed until Wednesday after an electronic unit destined for
another shuttle shorted out. Engineers blamed faulty wiring and
decided to check all other such units.
   In doing so, NASA found a unit with suspect wiring in one of
Discovery's solid fuel booster rockets and replaced it with a unit
taken from space shuttle Columbia.
   The unit routes all power, commands and data between the
spaceship and the boosters and commands the separation of the
rockets after about two minutes of flight.
   ``While the schedule is very tight, we feel we can make a
Wednesday launching,'' said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   Because the flight is classified, NASA and the Pentagon have
said only that the launch will occur between 6:30 p.m. and 10:30
p.m.. They will not make the exact time public until just nine
minutes before liftoff.
   Except for announcements on the landing day and time, there will
be a news blackout during the mission unless something major goes
wrong.
   The flight is expected to last four days.

<HEAD>Market Reform Bill Clears Senate Committee, Still Pends in House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bill that would allow the Securities and
Exchange Commission to halt trading during stock market emergencies
_ with the president's approval _ was passed by a Senate committee
Thursday.
   The proposed Market Reform Act of 1989 would give the SEC
authority to take temporary emergency action in response to a major
market disturbance.
   But the president would be required to state that he does not
disapprove of any action before it could take effect.
   Meanwhile, House members were working to get a similar bill out
of committee before Congress adjourns for the holidays.
   Lawmakers are hoping to complete their work for the year by next
Wednesday and adjourn until January.
   The House bill also would give the SEC the power to curtail
practices deemed ``manipulative or abusive'' _ including program
trading _ during periods of high volatility.
   That measure, pending before the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, went further than the pending Senate bill, the market
Reform Act of 1989.
   The Senate bill, which now goes to the full Senate, would give
the SEC the authority to:
   _ Halt trading during stock market emergencies like the crash of
1987 or the 190-point drop last month;
   _ Require large securities transactions to be reported;
   _ Require the parent and affiliated companies of securities and
investment firms to verify their financial stability;
   _ Coordinate the clearance and settlement of stock, option and
future trades with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the
federal agency that oversees the futures markets.
   The Senate bill was introduced in March by Sen. Christopher
Dodd, D-Conn., and Sen. John Heinz, R-Penn., at the request of the
SEC.
   The bill seeks to prevent some of the problems that contributed
to the stock market plunge in October 1987.
   ``It's absolutely critical that we pass this before we go,''
Dodd told the panel, which approved the bill by a voice vote after
leaders said they would oppose attempts to include amendements that
would limit takeovers or leveraged buyouts.
   Heinz noted the bill had the strong support of the SEC and the
Treasury Department as well as most segments of the industry.

<HEAD>NRC Makes Move That Could Speed Up Seabrook Licensing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said
Thursday it would immediately move toward a decision on licensing
the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant.
   In a three-page ruling, the commission said it would take the
case away from two lower-level boards who were disputing the
adequacy of emergency evacuation plans for New Hampshire residents
living near the plant. No timetable for action was announced.
   Rick Bornemann, spokesman for Connecticut's United Illuminating
Corp., owner of the second-largest share of the Seabrook plant,
said, ``Anything that speeds up this outcome is good news.''
   Opponents of Seabrook, meanwhile, reacted angrily.
   ``I am absolutely outraged,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. ``I
will ask for a speed-up of the congressional investigation of NRC
procedures that we called for this week.''
   The plant, planned since the early 1970s, was finished in 1986.
Licensing and operation has been held up by disputes over the
adequacy of emergency evaucation plans, particularly for
Massachusetts communities near the plant.
   The commission would have had to consider the action by the
boards in any case and it is under no obligation to wait for the
boards to complete their work.
   The Atomic Safety and Licensing Board earlier this week
dismissed a ruling by the Atomic Safety and Licensing Appeal Board
that questioned the effectiveness of the evacuation plans. The
licensing board's argument was that the concerns raised by the
appeal board should not stand in the way of Seabrook receiving a
license.
   Until Thursday's ruling, the appeal board was preparing to open
a two-week process during which arguments on the evacuation plans
would be heard.
   ``In the interests of efficiency and effectiveness in resolving
matters relating to the licensing board's authorization of the
issuance of a full-power license, the commission has decided that
it rather than the appeal board will consider all applications for
a stay of the licensing board's authorization of full-power
operation,'' the four commissioners said.

   A federal agency is denying charges by a
group of earthquake victims who contend they aren't getting the
benefits they deserve.
   Outside a crumbling and boarded residential hotel, the group
Wednesday presented a petition of grievances against the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, demanding parity for poorer victims of
the Oct. 17 earthquake.
   ``We're outraged against this discriminatory action of FEMA,''
said attorney Kenneth Zimmerman of the Legal Aid Society of Alameda
County.
   The group accused FEMA of violating its legal obligations to
ease the burdens of quake victims.
   Zimmerman accused FEMA of granting low-income tenants of
residential hotels and seasonal workers a half to a third of the
payments other renters are getting. He charged also that the agency
has labeled some people as ``pre-earthquake homeless'' when they
had addresses before the quake.
   Lorri L. Jean, FEMA's deputy federal coordinating officer,
categorically denied the allegations. She said the authors of the
petition ``do not understand FEMA's program and have not made an
attempt to try and understand FEMA's program.''
   She said long-term renters and homeowners get more money because
it takes them more time to relocate them than residential hotel
tenants.
   ``Those who need and qualify for help from FEMA and other
organizations receive it now and will continue to receive it,'' she
said.
   Jean said that as of Monday her agency paid out almost $6.3
million in temporary housing aid, and that the figure would soon
double.

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Thursday fired Arizona
millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr. as manager of a luxury resort
owned by his failed thrift institution, Lincoln Savings and Loan
Assocation.
   Keating and 23 family members and associates were dismissed from
positions at The Phoenician Resort, a 605-room golf, tennis and spa
complex carved from the Arizona desert near Scottsdale, as well as
from posts at the 344-room Crescent Hotel in Phoenix.
   Those dismissed included Keating's wife, Mary Elaine Keating,
two daughters and two sons-in-law.
   Regulators, accompanied by FBI agents, Phoenix police officers
and private security guards, seized the properties at 1:30 a.m.
local time, according to Alan J. Whitney, a spokesman for the
Resolution Trust Corp., a new agency created this summer to handle
failed S&amp;Ls.
   A spokesman for Keating denounced the seizure as ``the most
despicable, outrageous, blatant act of terror we have ever seen by
our U.S. government.''
   ``The Gestapo-like tactics used on employees and management of
the resort are just unconscionable,'' said Bradley Boland, senior
vice president of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental
Corp.
   ``They walked in ... they locked offices, they locked desks.
Then they went out into the community to the homes of the core
management group and posted severance notices on their front doors.
These guys are gutless, ruthless, faceless bureaucrats trying to
carry out their on-going vendetta against Charlie Keating,'' Boland
said.
   Keating's continuation as manager of the Phoenician, had
particularly galled members of the House Banking Committee. The
panel is investigating the collapse of the Irvine, Calif.-based
Lincoln, which is expected to be the nation's largest savings and
loan failure at a cost to taxpayers of $2 billion.
   A recent newspaper advertisement for the resort brags of its
``tiered oasis of pools and waterfalls'' and ``seven fine
restaurants.'' Robin Leach featured it on his television special,
``The Rich and Famous, 1989 World's Best.'' Current room rates
range from $200 a night to $3,750 for the most expensive suite,
according to the House panel.
   Federal regulators seized Lincoln and its subsidiaries,
including The Phoenician, in April and later filed a $1.1 billion
lawsuit against Keating and his associates alleging fraud and
racketeering.
   However, they could not dismiss Keating until they obtained the
approval of the Kuwaiti Investment Office, which has a 45 percent
interest in the resort and the right to block management changes,
Whitney said. The office, based in London, makes real estate
investments on behalf of the Kuwaiti government, he said.
   The RTC named Hans Turnovszky, formerly director of a ski resort
in Vail, Colo., as manager of the Phoenician.
   Although Keating drew no salary as manager of the Phoenician, he
continues to receive a $400,000-a-year salary as chairman of
American Continental. He is scheduled to testify before the House
banking panel on Tuesday.

   Some smokers threw away their cigarettes, but others kept
nicotine flowing in their veins Thursday as organizers of the 13th
annual Great American Smokeout pressed Americans to kick the habit.
   Newborns in New Jersey were given ``I'm a born non-smoker''
T-shirts; a national chain of restaurants offered ``cold turkey''
sandwiches for a half-pack of smokes, and a hospital in Maine gave
out carrot sticks and gum to relieve the craving to light up.
   The American Cancer Society, the Smokeout sponsor, said it hoped
that one-fifth of the country's 50 million smokers would give up
smoking for at least 24 hours, and that many of them would do so
for good.
   ``The more times you attempt to quit, the more likely you are to
be successful,'' said Kenneth A. Perkins, an assistant professor of
psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who endorsed the
Smokeout concept.
   Darlene Grinolds, 58, of Butte, Mont., said said she began
smoking when she was 9. Last year, she stayed off cigarettes for
four months after the Smokeout.
   This year, she hopes to make the ban permanent because ``I'm
tired of being a slave.''
   Steve Malko of Philadelphia took the opposite tack. ``I don't
want to quit. I enjoy it,'' he said. ``I've told myself I'll quit
when I'm married and my wife gets pregnant. Now all I have to do is
put off marriage.''
   Maine marked Smokeout day by putting into effect a strict ban on
smoking in hospitals, and many employers, including the Travelers
insurance giant in Hartford, Conn., instituted similar bans for
their workers.
   Osteopathic Hospital in Portland, Maine, handed out carrot
sticks and popcorn to quitting smokers, along with about 150
``survival kits'' including sugarless gum, sugarless candy,
crossword puzzles and ``anything to get them through the day,''
said Margaret Smith, office coordinator at the hospital.
   In Pittsburgh, the Subway Sandwich and Salad Shop hung a sign
saying, ``Leave the pack behind.'' It was part of a nationwide
promotion by the 1,350-restaurant chain inviting customers to trade
a half-pack or more of cigarettes for a cold turkey sandwich.
   Some employers who believe smoking increases their health
insurance and absenteeism costs offered even greater incentives.
Cummings Properties of Woburn, Mass., gave employees who pledged
not to smoke during work hours $500. The money was offered even to
those who have never picked up a cigarette in the first place.
   Seventy-two of the company's roughly 100 workers collected the
cash.
   James McKeown, executive vice president of the real estate
management company, said giving out the grants to all non-smokers
was ``the only way not to be punitive to non-smokers. The best way
to quit smoking is to never start.''
   Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory
disease and can threaten newborns whose mothers smoked during
pregnancy, scientists say. The surgeon general has warned of the
risks of smoking and the addictive nature of nicotine.
   Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City, which claims to be
the first hospital to ban smoking from its grounds three years ago,
offered free tests of lung function to make smokers stop and think.
   One Smokeout participant across the river in New Jersey had no
comment. Nicole Marie Manente got an ``I'm a born non-smoker''
T-shirt within hours of her birth Thursday morning at Meadowlands
Hospital Medical Center in Secaucus.
   ``When they put the T-shirt on her, she did not cry,'' assured
hospital spokeswoman Maura Kenny. Nicole's parents, from Weehawken,
do not smoke, she added.

<HEAD>Parliament Adopts Sweeping Law to Reduce Prison Terms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solidarity-led Parliament passed a law
Thursday that reduces the sentences of many prisoners and suspends
terms of those convicted of lesser crimes on the grounds the jail
terms set by Communist rulers were too severe.
   The vote was 293-19 with 61 abstentions. Among the supporters
were many deputies of the Solidarity trade union who were jailed
for their opposition to Communist rule.
   The law covers crimes committed before Sept. 12, the day the
460-member Parliament replaced a Communist government with the
administration of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a confidante
of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.
   It does not cover repeat offenders, drunk drivers responsible
for fatal accidents or those convicted of gang rape.
   More than a dozen deputies took the floor during the debate.
Most of the speakers were from the 161-member Solidarity caucus and
most favored the law.
   ``I was among those who had been sentenced. I think the Polish
legal system should be less strict,'' said Solidarity deputy Adam
Michnik, who was released in 1986 after five years in jail.
   ``The Polish law is so strict and the sentences have been too
severe. The Polish legal system has been rather repressive and the
sentences unjust. Nobody should be excluded from the amnesty,''
said Eugeniusz Ujas, another Solidarity deputy.
   A television news program said it was the first amnesty for
prisoners with long sentences since 1956, when prison terms were
reduced for many inmates sentenced during the Stalinist era in
Poland.
   The amnesty is the first step in an expected overhaul of the
penal code.
   The law suspends sentences of those who received sentences of up
to two years for common crimes and those who received sentences of
up to three years for premeditated crimes.
   The sentences must be reviewed by the court or prosecutor before
the prisoners are released.
   In the case of crimes carrying sentences of up to 10 years, the
terms will be reduced by half. Higher sentences are to be cut down
by one-third, while those carrying terms of 25 years will be
reduced to 15 years.
   Those prisoners who received a death penalty will now serve 25
years.
   Some of the opponents expressed concern that criminals would be
released and let loose on society in Poland's difficult transition
to democracy.
   New crimes and prison sentences were introduced after the
martial-law crackdown on Dec. 13, 1981, to crush Solidarity.
Solidarity was legalized again this April after a seven-year ban,
and its representatives trounced Communists in June parliamentary
elections.

   A young mother was charged Tuesday with
stabbing to death her three children, mutilating the bodies with a
steak knife and dumping the remains, lashed together with a cord,
on a neighbor's doorstep.
   Katrina McKay, 20, was taken into custody Wednesday after she
burst into the neighbor's home, naked and incoherent, with
self-inflicted, superficial stab wounds, authorities said.
   ``You wonder if you could have found out something in advance to
prevent this from happening,'' said Sheriff Arthur Johnson. ``I've
been in law enforcement for 20 years in Franklin County. ... This
is one of the worst that I've witnessed.''
   Ms. McKay was charged with murder in the slayings of Shenika
Chantel McKay, 2, Terrell Quentin McKay, 1, and Quincey Matthew
McKay, 2 months, said sheriff's Capt. Ralph Brown.
   ``Each child had multiple stab wounds, hundreds of stab
wounds,'' said Dr. J.B. Perdue Jr., medical examiner. He said the
victims' abdomens had been cut open and their organs strewn about a
bedroom.
   Ms. McKay lived with an uncle and the children in a house in a
rural area near here, about 30 miles north of Raleigh. The uncle
was at work when the killings occurred, Johnson said.

<HEAD>Panel Endorses Bill to Move 1,800 Acres from Nebraska to South Dakota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Dakota would grow by 1,800 acres under a
bill rushed through a House committee Thursday to move back a
12-mile stretch of the Nebraska border that lies along the shifting
course of the Missouri River.
   The strip of land on the north side of the river just west of
Sioux City, Iowa, technically lies in Nebraska because the river's
course has moved since the boundary was set in 1905, Rep. Tim
Johnson, D-S.D., told the House Judiciary subcommittee on
administrative law.
   An interstate compact that must be approved by Congress would
fix the boundary along the river's main channel. Legislatures of
both states have approved the change.
   The House could vote on the bill as early as Monday, Johnson
said.
   Johnson said the river is relatively stable now because the
Corps of Engineers has brought the river under control with dams
and channels.
   However, the Corps of Engineers said in a letter to the
committee that it is ``technically correct'' that the river is
stable now but that the channel could shift at some time as dikes
erode.
   Johnson said Congress should act quickly on the compact so that
construction can begin on a planned community and business park
along the river in Union County, S.D.
   The Dakota Dunes development, which would occupy 400 acres of
the disputed area, is eventually expected to house 3,000 people, he
said.

<TEXT>
   West Berlin's newest shelter for homeless
East German refugees will have 400 small rooms, walls three feet
thick and all the comfort of a jail _ which is what it was.
   U.S. Army Engineer units armed with steel-cutting rescue saws
and acetylene torches stormed the former Youth Detention Center
Wednesday morning and began cutting out the inch-thick bars on the
windows and removing the reinforced cell doors. The Army has
offered to help with the refugees.
   The engineers have just three days to make the house of
detention into a home. The 19th-century prison building, still in
use as a jail until five years ago, will be used as a transit
center for the refugees, most of whom are now sleeping in schools
and other public buildings.
   Since the Berlin Wall and the other fortifications dividing East
from West Germany were opened Friday, millions of East Germans have
flooded into the West. Although most have gone back across to their
homes, the West Berlin government said that about 7,500 East German
refugees had come to stay.
   ``My job is to get all the bars out of the window, to get away
from the jail cell appearance,'' said Sgt. Robert J. Hart, as the
gasoline-powered disc saws of his men roared and spewed exhaust
fumes along the cell blocks.
   His unit is also tearing out the iron bed frames and the
antiquated cell toilets to make the 7-by-12 foot cells more
liveable. The jailhouse graffiti will have to stay, because there's
no time for painting.
   ``They're going to move in more suitable furniture,'' Hart said.
``It's better than sleeping on the streets. At least they're out of
the weather.
   ``It's kind of ironic that now they're trying to get out to
freedom, they're moving into a jail. I just hope they appreciate
it.''
   Known to local wags as the ``Cafe Schoenstedstrasse'' because of
its location at the intersection of Karl Marx Strasse and
Schoenstedstrasse in the borough of Neukoln, the four tiers of
cells surround an exercise courtyard where occupants will be able
to stretch their legs.
   The West Berlin government will provide food for the refugees
until more permanent lodging can be found.
   Because of their size, each cell can only accomodate one person,
but Hart said they'd be as comfortable as the Army can make them.
   ``I believe everybody should have a chance for freedom. Now
they're having it,'' said Hart, from California, Mo.
   But one of his men, Spec. 4 Daniel Bross of Newton, Ill., was
concerned that a prison might be too much a reminder of repression.
   ``How would you feel if just got out of a country where you
couldn't do nothing and they stuck you in a 6-by-6 room?''

<HEAD>Bush May Leave Early for Seagoing Summit With Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush may leave a day early for his
seagoing summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev so he
can visit a U.S. aircraft carrier and perhaps address sailors of
the Mediterranean fleet, officials said Thursday.
   Bush originally had been scheduled to leave Washington early
Dec. 1 and fly to Malta for two days of talks with Gorbachevon U.S.
and Soviet warships anchored about 1,000 feet offshore.
   However, officials said Thursday that Bush may leave the evening
of Nov. 30 and fly through the night, arriving in Malta early the
next morning. Under that plan, the president would then fly out to
the carrier Forrestal, meet with servicemen and perhaps deliver a
speech to sailors gathered from other ships in the region.
   Bush would spend the remainder of the day preparing for the Dec.
2-3 summit talks. His headquarters will be the USS Belknap, a
guided missile cruiser.
   The first day of talks are to be held on Gorbachev's ship, the
Slava, followed by meetings the next day on Bush's ship. Bush will
give a dinner for Gorbachev on the Belknap on Dec. 2.
   The two leaders are expected to close their summit with a joint
statement on the afternoon of Dec. 3 and then hold separate news
conferences.
   Bush is to spend the night of Dec. 3 on the Belknap and fly to
Brussels, Belgium, the next day to report to NATO allies on the
talks. He returns to Washington on Dec. 4.
   Bush was expected to make remarks both on his departure from
Washington and on his arrival home.

<TEXT>
   Eight months after a cyanide scare briefly
halted the import of Chilean fruit, some researchers believe that
the poison found in grapes was introduced after they arrived in the
United States, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Wall Street Journal quoted researchers as saying that if the
grapes had been injected prior to their two-week voyage from Chile,
they would have shriveled before they arrived.
   It would have been difficult to get to the grapes when they were
in the hold of the ship, the newspaper said, and Food and Drug
Administration officials say that the ship was unloaded amid tight
security.
   The newspaper said researchers at the University of California
at Davis found that four hours after they injected cyanide into
grapes, cyanide levels matched the amounts found by FDA chemists.
   That suggests the grapes were injected after they were unloaded
and in FDA hands but before they were tested, the newspaper said.
   An FDA spokesman strongly rejected the Journal account.
   ``It's the FDA's continued belief that the grapes were poisoned
in Chile before the ship left,'' spokesman Jeff Nesbit said.
   The Journal also quoted researchers who were critical of the
tests performed by FDA chemists after inspectors in Philadelphia
turned up three grapes they believed were tainted.
   They said by using a centrifuge instead of a distilling process,
the FDA chemists exaggerated the amount of cyanide in the grapes.
   The Journal also reported that despite claims by the FDA that
inspectors were on a hit-or-miss mission when they found the
tainted grapes, it appears that they specifically zeroed in on the
ship on which the grapes came and on the grapes of a single
vineyard.
   FDA's Nesbit said that a terrorist had made threats ``that his
group could poison the grapes up to and when the ship was actually
sailing. But because it would be difficult to poison the grapes in
the hold of the ship because of the way crates are packed, it seems
most likely the grapes were poisoned before the ship sailed, as the
agency has maintained all along.''
   Asked about the story's inference that cyanide-laced grapes
would deteriorate after two weeks, he said, ``We have done our own
experiments where grapes injected with cyanide after two weeks had
not deteriorated much, that they still looked appetizing.''
   He added that ``probably some (cyanide-laced) grapes might
deteriorate after two weeks, but not all of them.''
   Asked if the FDA was involved in the poisoning, he said: ``No,
that's not very feasible or possible.''
   He denied the FDA had been tipped to where to look for the
grapes. ``We had no idea where to look for those grapes,'' he said.

<HEAD>GAO Says Foreign Agriculture Programs Wasting Millions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Millions of dollars have been wasted because
of mismanagement in federal programs that subsidize agriculture
exports, a farm state congressman said Thursday.
   ``This is one of the biggest cases of mismanagment ever in the
history of the Agriculture Department,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman,
D-Kan., after receiving two investigative reports on three export
programs.
   Glickman said the investigations by the Agriculture Department's
inspector general and the congressional General Accounting Office
did not reveal fraud but showed ``lack of controls.''
   ``There has been an enormous waste of government funds,'' he
said of the export enhancement program, the targeted export
assistance program and the export credit guarantee programs.
   ``These audits were done prior to this administration,'' said
Sally Michael, spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter.
   She said the department appreciates the review of the programs
and is working with both the inspector general and GAO.
   ``We want to respond to their criticisms,'' she said.
   The first two programs were established in 1985 to help U.S.
exporters compete with countries that heavily subsidize their
commodities on the world market. The third guarantees that
exporters will be repaid for credit sales made to foreign buyers,
even if the buyer defaults.
   When it comes to targeted export assistance and export
enhancment, foreign agriculture service officials have not been
sufficiently documenting their decisions and say they don't have
time to do so, said the GAO.
   ``We believe that such documentation is essential to ensure
accountablity and fairness,'' the agency said.
   Furthermore, the inspector general said the foreign agriculture
service didn't have written policies to determine how it calculates
the subsidies it gives.
   ``Although FAS officials prepare price sheets which list each of
the figures used in price and bonus calculations, they do not
provide either narrative or statistical support to explain how they
arrived at these figures,'' said the GAO.
   The reviews indicated ``control weaknesses in the bonus payment
process which allowed overpayments to occur,'' said the GAO.
   The GAO also said better controls were needed in the credit
guarantee program.
   ``Our review also indicates that controls are not in place to
ensure that exporters are complying with applicable regulations,''
said the GAO.
   Glickman said the inspector general's report ``estimates that
USDA may have misspent as much as $114.8 million solely in
miscalculating bonuses awarded to exporters by understanding the
world price and overstating incidental costs incurred by
participating exporters.''

   The United States said Thursday it will ask
for an investigation into the killing of six Roman Catholic priests
in El Salvador, and will accelerate deliveries of military aid to
government forces there.
   ``We do not know who committed this barbarous act, which we
condemn in the strongest possible terms,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   A Jesuit priest, who spoke only on condition he not be
identified, told reporters in San Salvador that a witness saw 30
uniformed soldiers enter the grounds of the University of Central
America shortly before the six priests and two university employees
were tortured and killed.
   Both the Salvadoran government and its armed forces denied any
involvement in the incident.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater condemned the
killings in a statement late Thursday and said the Salvadoran
government was reported to have begun an investigation.
   ``We condemn in the strongest possible terms the outrageous
murder of Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of the University of
Central America, and the other Jesuit priests in El Salvador,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``We understand that the Salvadoran government has begun an
investigation and we will be watching this investigation closely.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said U.S. Ambassador William Walker will ask the
Salvadoran government for a ``full inquiry'' into killings at the
university. She said Walker intended to raise the matter directly
with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani on Thursday.
   The Conference of Major Superiors of Men, representing 260
religious orders, condemned the killings and called for renewed
efforts to negotiate a peace in El Salvador.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she and Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., had sent telegrams to the Salvadoran government and
leftist FMLN guerrillas asking them to respect a Red Cross request
for a 72-hour cease-fire to allow evacuation of civilians and the
wounded.
   She said the Bush administration should do everything it can to
halt the fighting and arrange negotiations.
   Pete Williams, spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said
the Pentagon is accelerating delivery of military assistance
previously requested by Salvadoran authorities.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the request from San Salvador included riot
control equipment and light weaponry.
   ``I understand some of the equipment is new but other items have
been on request for some time, and we are merely speeding up
delivery,'' Williams said.
   The administration has requested $370 million in economic and
military aid next year for El Salvador, which the United States
regards as its closest ally in Central America. Of the total, $85
million is arms aid.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States is confident of the
Cristiani government's ability to defeat the guerrillas who began a
major offensive earlier this week.
   ``We believe the Salvadoran govenment is able to manage the
situation,'' she said.
   The Pentagon spokesman said U.S. military advisers are
monitoring the situation but are neither involved in the fighting
nor directing Salvadoran troops.
   U.S. officials have accused the rebels of using civilians in San
Salvador as protection, and say Salvadoran troops are moving
cautious to keep down the number of casualties.
   ``Both the army and the ai force are dislodging remaining
pockets of guerrillas from neighborhoods where they have dug in,''
Ms. Tutwiler said. ``In this environment where the FMLN is using
civilians to shield its combatants, strict rules of engagement have
been issued by the Salvadoran government to prevent civilian
casualties,'' she said.

   President's Bush's nominee to head the Urban
Mass Transportation Administration was approved by the Senate after
a two-month delay while a committee investigated work done by his
auditing firm.
   Brian W. Clymer was confirmed by unanimous consent Wednesday
night once a ``hold'' on his nomination was lifted by the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
   The committee had unanimously backed Clymer's nomination on
Sept. 8. But the panel delayed sending the nomination to the Senate
floor while it examined work done by Clymer's suburban Philadelphia
accounting firm on behalf of an economic development organization
nearby, according to a Senate aide who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   According to the aide, the committee asked a certified public
accountant from the General Accounting Office of Congress to
determine whether Clymer's firm should have uncovered questionable
expenditures by the Delaware County Economic Development
Partnership. The aide said it was determined the firm had done its
job properly.
   A committee spokeswoman said Thursday she could not discuss the
results of the investigation. ``All Senate confirmation procedures
had been completed and it was now time to release the hold,''
committee aide Deborah DeYoung said.
   The partnership was founded in 1983 by Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa.
The congressman asked consultant Anthony J. Dunleavy to investigate
the partnership earlier this year following press reports about the
awarding of no-bid contracts.
   Of particular interest to the Senate panel were no-bid contracts
awarded Clymer's firm by the partnership to audit its books.
Dunleavy said in an interview Thursday that he was asked about the
contracts recently by the committee staff.
   Dunleavy said that this year's contract was properly bid. But he
said that the contracts for 1986, 1987 and 1988 were not awarded
through competitive procurement policies required by the federal
government, and that federal money was used.
   Dunleavy also said Thursday that the partnership misspent
$121,000 in federal funds on ineligible items such as a promotional
film between July 1988 and July 1989.
   But Dunleavy said that Clymer's firm was just now auditing that
period. Dunleavy said there had also been improper expenditures in
previous years, but that there was no reason Clymer's firm should
have discovered them.
   ``In layman's terms, he's been criticized for not doing
something he was never asked to do,'' Dunleavy said. He also said
Clymer should not have been expected to know that the 1986, 1987
and 1988 contracts were not properly bid.
   Clymer already has a desk at UMTA, where he has been acting as a
consultant. UMTA assists state and local governments in improving
mass transportation systems.
   Clymer was on a business trip in California Thursday, and could
not be reached for comment, according to UMTA spokesman Richard
Centner. Clymer is the former vice chairman of the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, which runs Philadelphia's
mass transit system.

   A Navy boat with 10 sailors aboard was
swamped as it returned to base Thursday to take part in an
unprecedented, two-day ``stand-down'' that had sailors around the
world brushing up on safety.
   In Navy wardrooms and engine compartments, flight decks and
hangars, crews were busy in lectures and training. The Navy ordered
the halt to normal operations Tuesday after a rash of 10 accidents
over the last three weeks killed 10 people and injured at least 71.
   The 36-foot Navy Seafox was swamped in stormy weather on the
nearby York River as it headed to Cheatham Annex near Williamsburg.
The 10 sailors aboard the Seafox were picked up by a Virginia
Institute of Marine Science vessel that was in the area, said Lt.
Cmdr. Steve Burnett, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman in Norfolk. None
were injured.
   A Seafox is a twin-engine boat designed for special warfare
operations.
   A second Seafox towed the swamped boat, which is designed to
float even when flooded, said Burnett. They were returning from
training in Maryland.
   ``At no time was it a life threatening situation,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, aboard the guided missile cruiser USS Josephus
Daniels docked at the Norfolk Naval Station, Petty Officer Mike
Ballard instructed seamen in damage control.
   Again and again, Ballard walked sailors through the proper way
to wear firefighting equipment and the necessary checks for each
safety device.
   Every sailor is trained in damage control, according to Lt. j.g.
Paul Ward, the ship's assistant damage control officer. He said the
ships runs a daily fire or rescue drill. Ward saw the stand-down as
a good way to stress safety to all hands.
   ``Our job is to carry out our mission while sustaining damage.
Everyone here has to be a capable firefighter. When there is a fire
on board, you can't just run away. ... There is nowhere to run,''
Ward said.
   Throughout the ship, sailors gathered in compartments for talks
about electrical safety, fire aid and weapons handling.
   While sailors were going to school aboard the Daniels, 30 miles
away at the Oceana Naval Air Station the pilots of Squardon VF-41
were in their ready room going over data on the flight performance
of the F-14 Tomcat.
   The squadron already had been scheduled for a safety inspection
Friday by the Naval Safety Center, so the stand-down did not affect
the flight schedule. One pilot characterized the exercise as a
``two-day stand-around.''
   But aboard the San Diego-based carrier Independence, ``we're
taking this very seriously,'' said ship spokesman Lt. Greg Smith.
   A stand-down ``doesn't mean everything is at a standstill,''
said Lt. Mike Andrews, a spokesman for the U.S. 7th Fleet, based in
Japan. ``Ships at sea will obviously maintain normal watch
stations'' while conducting safety reviews.
   At the Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, Rear Adm. Phil
Anselmo joined about 1,000 sailors in a walk around runways,
taxiways and aprons looking for potentially hazardous litter. They
found about 50 pounds, including industrial bolts and chunks of
epoxy.
   Out on the hangar floor at Oceana, Lt. Cmdr. Ken Heimgartner
watched young crewmen go over his F-14.
   ``After a while, you start equating safety with combat
readiness,'' said Heimgartner, the squadron commander. ``When you
start seeing something unsafe, that's an indicator you may not be
combat ready.''
   The order Tuesday gave all Navy units 72 hours to complete 48
hours of safety stand-down. Most Atlantic Fleet units began the
stand-down Thursday morning, according to Burnett.
   Stand-downs are not unusual, though this is the first in memory
that involved the entire service, said Capt. Ferguson Norton, the
Navy's top safety officer.

   The heart of an Israeli soldier ambushed and
killed by Arab guerrillas was sewn into the chest of a Palestinian
on Thursday, a gift of life that family members said transcends the
bitter war between Arab and Jew.
   Hanna Khader, 54, a former hotel manager from Israeli-annexed
east Jerusalem, was recovering in stable condition in the intensive
care ward at Hadassah medical center, Khader's family said.
   ``God, I don't really know what to say,'' said his daughter,
Jamilla. ``We thank the family that agreed to give the heart to a
human being without looking if he were an Arab or a Jew.''
   Khader's wife, Mary, said: ``I can't tell you how happy I am.
He's a human being and there is no difference between a Palestinian
and an Israeli in such cases.''
   Jamilla told Israel radio the family learned from the media that
her father's heart donor was a slain Israeli soldier.
   She indicated her family had some concern that they could be
targeted by Palestinian or Islamic radicals for accepting an
Israeli's heart, but said ``in such cases we cannot mix politics
with medicine.''
   ``I hope that the events (in the occupied territories) will end
and everything will return to normal,'' she added.
   The heart was removed from Sgt. Zeev Traum, 40, after he died
Wednesday night of a head wound suffered after Palestinian
guerrillas raked his patrol jeep with at least 28 rounds of
automatic gunfire in an ambush Monday, Israel radio said. A second
soldier also was killed.
   Traum, an army reservist and father of four, was the 42nd
Israeli to die in the violence of the 23-month uprising against
Israeli rule. At least 615 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
troops or civilians in the bloodshed. Another 146 Palestinians have
been slain by others who accused them of collaborating with Israeli
authorities.
   In an interview with Israel television that broke a day of
silence, Brenda Traum refused comment when asked whether she agreed
to the doctor's request to transplant her husband's heart into the
body of an Arab.
   She did say, however, that she believed her husband would have
agreed to donate an organ if it could save a life.
   ``If it is possible to save a person I think it is a religious
commandment,'' she said, speaking from her home in Yodfat, a
collective farm where Traum raised flowers for export.
   ``Zeev was a man who helped people as a natural matter of
course, without being asked,'' she said. ``We spoke about
transplants a bit and he said it was a good thing.''
   Hadassah hospital took the unusual step of asking doctors and
spokesmen not to comment on the transplant, Israel radio said,
apparently because of the operation's sensitive political nature.
   Azai Applebaum, the director of cardiology, broke the silence
Thursday night and appeared on television.
   ``We treat the sick and we have never looked at nationality or
identity,'' he said. ``I don't think that this point has
significance in an operation like this.''
   Israel radio said Traum's condition began deteriorating rapidly
Tuesday night and doctors asked the family to agree to donate his
heart to one of dozens of Israelis and Arabs waiting for a
transplant.
   The family agreed and Khader was chosen as a recipient because
his body tissue closely matched that of Traum.
   The heart was flown in a special ice chest by military
helicopter from Soroka hospital in Beer Sheva to Jerusalem's
Hadassah hospital at midnight Wednesday night and the 4-hour
transplant was immediately performed.
   It was the ninth heart transplant performed in Israel but the
first known case since the uprising began of an Israeli donating an
organ to a Palestinian.
   In December, the family of a Palestinian family shot to death by
an Israeli soldier in the West Bank town of Nablus refused to
donate their son's heart to an Israeli civilian.
   The Palestinian, Nasr Hawwash, 20, was declared brain dead after
sustaining a serious head wound Dec. 16. during a demonstration.
   The Israeli, Yehiel Israeli, 46, had been hooked to a respirator
since Dec. 18 after unsuccessful surgery on a heart valve. He died
three days later.

<HEAD>Unions Defy State of Siege, Call 24-hour Strike</HEAD>

   The nation's largest labor group defied a
state of siege Thursday and called a 24-hour strike to pressure the
government to free hundreds of people rounded up by police.
   Schools, government-owned mines and some factories were
affected, but businesses, banks and offices were open and public
transport operated normally.
   Labor Minister Oscar Zamora claimed only ``2 percent of the work
force'' took part in the strike.
   Officials declared the strike illegal and said police would
arrest labor leaders who disobeyed the state of siege, which
imposes a curfew from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., restricts public gatherings
and allows arrests without warrant.
   Guillermo Capobianco, the interior minister, said the purpose of
the state of siege was ``to preserve economic stability and the
foreign assistance needed to reactivate the economy, re-establish
peace and guarantee municipal elections.''
   The Bolivian Workers Central, which includes most of Bolivia's
labor force, called the strike to demand freedom for 858 teachers,
students and workers police detained Wednesday. The government
released several hundred, but sent 146 to detention camps in the
Bolivian tropics.
   President Jaime Paz Zamora's government declared the state of
siege Wednesday in response to protest marches and a hunger strike
by hundreds of teachers and other workers. Police have used tear
gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds of rock throwing students
and teachers.
   When the siege was declared, three leaders of the teachers'
union were in critical condition from the effects of a 24-day
hunger strike, but doctors said Thursday they were out of danger.
   Teachers demand the equivalent of $103 each in a year-end bonus
to compensate for the increasing cost of living, but the government
says that would upset the economy and contribute to inflation.
   Schoolteachers earn an average salary equivalent to $75 a month
and 18 percent of the government budget goes to education.
   Opposition parties said they would defy the state of siege and
candidates in the Dec. 3 municipal elections would hold rallies
despite restrictions on public gatherings.
   ``No governmental decree will prohibit us from conducting
political activity on the streets,'' said Antonio Aranibar of the
United Leftist Party.
   ``Holding elections under a state of siege constitutes a
tremendous aberration without precedent in Latin America,'' said a
statement from the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement, the main
opposition party.
   The opposition group, which controlled the government during the
four years before Paz Zamora took office three months ago, declared
states of siege on two occasions to quell social unrest and
opposition to its austerity measures.
   Paz Zamora's administration has said there will be no pay
increases or bonuses until next year.
   ``Our No. 1 priority is to preserve economic stability and
attract foreign investors, said Raul Loayza, undersecretary of the
interior.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says German Reunification Not Realistic Now</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said again Thursday
that the two Germanys may be reunited someday, but not now.
   In a television broadcast of his answers to questions at a
conference of students, Gorbachev repeated earlier statements that
the existence of two German states is reality and trying to change
it ``would be meddling into the affairs of the Federal Republic of
Germany and the German Democratic Republic.''
   ``You have to proceed from this reality,'' he said. ``As to how
history will turn out in the future, we will live and see.
   ``I think all European society and the international community
are interested in stability. Both the world and Europe could
develop and come to new forms of coexistence, and life will show
what will happen. Let's not read tea leaves.''
   ``The whole world is changing, and these changes are positive.''
   Little was said of reunification except in West Germany until
tens of thousands of people began fleeing East Germany last summer
and huge protests for democracy began inside the country.
   Last week's opening of the Berlin Wall and the border between
East and West Germany suddenly made the idea conceivable and the
debate began.
   Gorbachev gave a formal speech to the students Wednesday, then
answered written questions. The speech was broadcast Wednesday and
his responses to the questions were shown Thursday night.

   The Communist Party overhauled its ruling
Politburo on Thursday, sweeping out three members of the old guard
and installing four more liberal men likely to support Petar
Mladenov, the new leader.
   The one-day session of the party's policy-setting Central
Committee was called less than a week after the removal of Todor
Zhivkov, 78, who led the nation with rigid orthodoxy for 35 years.
   BTA, the official news agency, said speakers at the Central
Committee meeting described the remaking of the Politburo as a step
``without which onward progress is hardly possible.''
   They expressed the party's resolve to ``pursue the watershed
policy of renewal of socialism ...on the basis of democratization,
openness and responsibility of everyone,'' the agency said.
   Zhivkov resigned Nov. 10 and was replaced by Mladenov, 53, who
was foreign minister and is considered more open to reform.
   The Central Committee ousted three members of the 10-member
Politburo with close ties to Zhivkov and named four new members.
One of the seats filled was Zhivkov's.
   The committee also accepted a proposal that Mladenov be
nominated to replace Zhivkov as president and approved suggestions
for unspecified government changes proposed by Premier Georgi
Atanassov, BTA reported.
   Mladenov is expected to be replaced as foreign minister but the
agency gave no indication of what other changes might be made.
   Removed from office was Politburo member Milko Balev, 69, a
close associate of Zhivkov who for many years was his private
secretary. Also ousted was Dimitar Stoyanov, 61, a former interior
minister.
   Western analysts speaking on condition of anonymity said
Stoyanov was associated with the widely condemned forced
assimiliation of the 1.5 million-member Turkish minority.
   Also removed was Grisha Filipov, 70, a former premier who was
responsible for economic policy.
   Balev, Stoyanov and Filipov were also expelled from the Central
Committee.
   Petko Danchev, a non-voting member of the Politburo who was
reportedly a Zhivkov protoge was also ousted, BTA reported.
   The new Politburo members are the current foreign trade
minister, Andrei Lukanov, 51, who is considered a liberal. The
others promoted to the ruling body were Nacho Papazov, Pantelei
Pachov and Mincho Yovchev. Papazov had been in charge of a
commission for reform in the party.
   There were several shakeups in the Central Committee as well.
According to a resolution carried by the state BTA news agency,
Zhivkov's son, Vladimir, was expelled from committee.
   The Central Committee also reinstated former members Stoyan
Mihailov and Svetlin Roussev, who were removed in 1988.
   Roussev, an artist, was active in establishing an unofficial
committee to protect the environment, while Mihailov had been
stripped of his ideology portfolio after being criticized for what
appeared to be deemed a too liberal interpretation of Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   Mladenov has moved quickly to assert reforms since his
appointment Nov. 10, when he pledged greater openness and called
for the establishment of a ``contemporary democratic and
law-abiding country.''
   His appointment was greeted by intellectuals and the official
media. According to an opinion poll published in the trade union
daily Troud on Thursday, Bulgarian citizens also welcomed the new
leader as providing hope for change.
   Thursday's personnel changes followed a decision by the
Politburo on Monday to restore the party membership of 11 activists
and on Tuesday, Mladenov met with a group of intellectuals, many of
them members of opposition groups.
   The leadership shakeup in Bulgaria comes as reform is sweeping
the Soviet bloc. This Balkan country has traditionally been one of
the Kremlin's most loyal allies, but while Zhivkov's leadership
paid lip-service to reform, little was done to implement change.

<HEAD>Ex-Police Officer Tells of Death Squad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police captain has
admitted participating in the murders of government opponents as
part of a special police unit, a newspaper reported Friday.
   Dirk Coetzee, identified in the article as a white captain who
left the police force in 1982, was interviewed on the Indian Ocean
island of Mauritius after leaving South Africa last week, said the
Afrikaans-language newspaper, Free Weekly.
   The paper quoted Coetzee as saying he had been actively involved
with a police hit squad until August 1982 when he left the force,
but had kept in contact with the unit's members and knew of further
misdeeds committed since his departure.
   Coetzee is the second former policeman recently to admit being
part of a death squad. Last month, a black former security
policeman on Death Row was reprieved the day before his set
execution when he contacted attorneys and said that when he was
part of the squad in 1981 he had killed black anti-apartheid
attorney Griffiths Mxenge in Durban.
   The black policeman was about to hang for a murder committed
during a robbery after he left the police force, and he said he
spoke out because his former colleagues failed to keep promises to
save him.
   According to Free Weekly, Coetzee also listed the Mxenge murder
among the acts committed by the squad to which he belonged. The
paper said Coetzee admitted planning and taking part in murders.
   The newspaper quoted Coetzee as saying the police death squad
sent the letter bomb to Maputo, Mozambique, in 1982 that killed
Ruth First, wife of South African Communist Party leader Joe Slovo.
   The paper said Coetzee also said his squad was responsible for:
   _the killing of African National Congress member Patrick Makau
and his child at Manzini, Swaziland, in 1980;
   _a bomb explosion at the ANC's London office in 1982;
   _the murder of two ANC members near Komatipoort on the
Mozambican border in 1980,
   _the attempted murder of ANC military wing leader Chris Hani in
Lesotho.
   In the article, Coetzee alleged that police stole cars, killed
guard dogs and people with poison, and used former members of
outlawed guerrilla organizations to carry out some deeds.
   The Free Weekly article was made available just after midnight
to the independent South African Press Association, and there was
no immediate comment from police officials. But high-ranking
officials already have been appointed to investigate the charges
made by the reprieved black security policeman.
   There have been about 20 unsolved killings and bombings of
anti-apartheid activists and organizations the past 10 years.
Anti-apartheid leaders have often said they believe security force
members are involved, but have no proof.
   The Free Weekly said Coetzee had left the country with his wife
and children to start a new life, and gave the interview to ``put
the past right.''

   Federal sentencing guidelines violate the
rights of criminal defendants by giving prosecutors arbitrary power
to determine prison terms, a federal judge ruled Thursday.
   U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene said the guidelines are
``revolutionizing the criminal justice system'' by letting
prosecutors determine punishment.
   ``This change has in substantial measure eliminated the safety
valve in terms of fairness and due process of an impartial judge
exercising whatever sentencing discretion any particular criminal
statute allows,'' Greene said.
   The full impact of Greene's ruling is not clear. But it could
set the stage for a new nationwide test of the sentencing law.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens, who is in charge of prosecutions in
federal court here, said in a statement issued by his office that
he was reviewing the opinion and could not comment immediately on
its impact.
   ``In the past five years, in response to the escalating drug
epidemic and related crimes of violence, Congress has enacted
fundamental and important changes in the criminal justice system,''
Stephens said. ``The U.S. attorney's office will utilize fairly and
aggressvely all the laws enacted by Congress in fulfilling our
obligation to protect the citizens of this community.''
   The Supreme Court, in an 8-1 ruling in January, said the
sentencing guidelines do not violate constitutionally required
separation of powers between the three branches of government.
   But the justices did not decide whether the new system violates
due process protections for defendants _ the grounds relied upon by
Greene.
   The system took effect in November 1987 for people convicted of
federal crimes and was designed to eliminate what some called
unjustified disparities in sentences. Those accused of crimes in
state courts are not affected.
   Greene became at least the second federal judge to declare the
new system violates due process rights aimed at guaranteeing fair
play for all defendants.
   U.S. District Judge Michael M. Mihm in Peoria, Ill., handed down
a similar ruling in September.
   Greene said the system may be particularly capricious because of
the secrecy surrounding what crime a defendant will be accused of
commiting. That decision ``takes place in the back rooms of the
U.S. attorney's office'' _ not in open court, the judge said.
   It often means a young prosecutor with little experience will
decide whether the defendant is accused of a crime carrying a
five-year or a 20-year prison term, he said.
   Greene acted in the case of five people accused of drug-related
crimes.
   One defendant, identified only as Jane Doe, has a 4-year-old
child and is seven months pregnant, Greene said.
   She faces a prison term of 21 to 27 months for transporting
marijuana, the judge said. Moreover, he continued, she is
handicapped from plea bargaining for leniency because she
apparently is not in a position to give prosecutors enough help in
convicting any drug kingpin.
   Greene ordered a hearing for the woman to determine whether
prosecutors were ``aribitrary and capricious'' in refusing to give
her the chance for a reduced sentence.
   He also ordered hearings for Stephaney Roberts, who faces a
mandatory 10-year sentence for distributing crack cocaine, and
Vernon Holland, charged with cocaine possession with intent to
distribute.
   Greene dismissed similar charges against Albert Mills and
Kenneth Wonson.

<TEXT>
   The main Communist Party daily, until now the
most reluctant to embrace the new spirit of change, jumped on the
reform bandwagon Thursday with a new editor and a more lively tone.
   In a front-page notice to readers, Neues Deutschland said the
moves were needed to promote renewal. Previously the newspaper had
been critical of opposition groups and of calls for an end to the
Communist monopoly on power.
   Long-time chief editor Herbert Naumann was replaced by Wolfgang
Spickermann, who signed the announcement of the top-level shakeup.
   ``As in all of the fundamental organizations within our party,
the comrades in editing and publishing in these weeks have exposed
their work to a confrontation with the past,'' the newspaper said.
   ``The result of these discussions is not just a new editorial
board, but above all the concept for a rejuvenated newspaper,''
Neues Deutschland said.
   It promised ``new content, more information, political views and
timely journalistic forums.''
   While state-run East German television and other publications
have given relatively balanced coverage of the rise of opposition
groups and independent actions by parties allied with the
Communists, Neues Deutschland had been more defensive of the
party's leading role and control of state affairs.
   The newspaper's front page on Thursday conveyed a more
reform-oriented image, with more than a dozen articles addressing
problems and benefits resulting from the newly opened borders and
other changes introduced the past month.
   It also published a call for more public involvement in
government affairs, providing telephone numbers for readers to call
in with advice, proposals and criticism.
   The format of the newspaper was little revised, with numerous
small articles but no pictures to break up the gray monotony.
   But the changed approach to reporting was clear in articles from
foreign countries discussing what can or should be done to help
East Germany develop in the right political and economic directions.

   Citizens still must have police
approval to travel to the West after the first of the year even
though exit visas will not be necessary, the government said
Thursday.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec announced Tuesday that exit visas no
longer would be required.
   Government spokesman Miroslav Pavel told reporters Thursday the
visa would be replaced by a ``statistical sheet'' issued by police
and valid for one trip abroad.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Jiri Belohlavek told the official
news agency CTK the statistical sheets were being introduced
because ``a record of Czechoslovak citizens' travels abroad is
necessary.'' He did not elaborate.
   Anyone wishing to travel to the West now must apply for exit
visas with Interior Ministry authorities after receiving a
passport. Stamps of approval are required from the local Communist
party branch, the person's employer and the army, so the process
can take up to 30 days.
   Even under the new regulations, Czechoslovaks would have to
maintain foreign currency deposits in banks or present invitations
to visit from relatives or friends abroad, Pavel said.
   Government officials have given no indication that people
previously denied passports will be given permission to travel
under the new regulations.
   The government said Thursday it would cancel weekend trips to
Czechoslovakia organized by state travel agencies for people from
Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, due to
``excessive purchases'' of consumer goods.
   Rising prices in those countries and shortages of certain goods
make food, clothing and shoes relatively cheap in Czechoslovakia.
   Last month, authorities restricted exports of a long list of
consumer goods ranging from meat to personal computers.

   A powerful storm system brought strong winds and heavy
thunderstorms to the Northeast on Thursday, causing flooding and
widespread property damage. Seven children died when a wall
collapsed in a school cafeteria near Newburgh, N.Y.
   Tornadoes were reported in New Jersey, Delaware, Virginia and
New York, although the National Weather Service was unable to
confirm them. The same storm system caused tornadoes in seven
states in the South and Midwest on Wednesday, and was blamed for 17
deaths in Huntsville, Ala.
   The storm was particularly violent because it occurred along a
line of extreme variations in temperature. High temperature records
fell in advance of the storm and sharply colder weather lurked
behind it.
   Record highs were recorded in Binghamton, N.Y., where it was 61
degrees, Bridgeport, Conn., (66), and Burlington, Vt., (69). A
record was also set in Miami, where it was 89.
   Thunderstorms continued across the Ohio Valley overnight and
during the morning. Storms that might have been tornadoes damaged a
residence and a store near Richmond, Va., and uprooted about 600
feet of trees near Wilmington, Del. Other storms that might have
been tornados were reported near Peekskill, N.Y., and Piscataway,
N.J., during the afternoon.
   Strong thunderstorms caused a concrete-and-glass wall to blow in
on a cafeteria during lunchtime at the East Coldenham Elementary
School near Newburgh. Seven children were killed and 18 injured.
   There were reports of damage from strong thunderstorms and gusty
winds in eastern Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, eastern
Pennsylvania and eastern New York state. Winds gusted to 65 mph in
Baltimore, 76 mph in Lancaster, Pa., and 100 mph at Great Valley,
Pa.
   A tornado watch was posted for northeast New York state, much of
Vermont and much of New Hampshire.
   Thunderstorms also produced locally heavy rain and flooding. A
flood warning was posted over portions of upstate New York. Nearly
two inches of rain fell east of Utica, N.Y., at the Little Falls
Reservoir, which overflowed and caused flooding.
   Water was eroding the Lyons Pond Dam near Dolgeville, N.Y.,
causing flooding there.
   Snow was falling west of the cold front. A winter storm warning
was posted for northwest Wisconsin, in the snowbelt near Lake
Superior. Winter storm warnings were posted for much of lower
Michigan, northwestern upper Michigan and north central Indiana.
   Winds gusted to 63 mph at Whitefish Point, Mi., and near
blizzard conditions extended over eastern upper Michigan.
   Overnight snowfall across upper Michigan included 12 inches at
Van Riper State Park and 10 inches near Neguanee.
   Heavier snowfall during the 6 hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included 4 inches at Houghton Lake, Mich., 3 inches at Marquette,
Pellston, Saginaw and Sault Ste. Marie, all in Michigan, and 2
inches at South Bend, Ind.
   Heavy snow warnings were posted for the northwest and northern
mountain portions of Pennsylvania. A snow squall warning was posted
for northeast Ohio.
   Cold weather was expected to invade the Southeast, with warnings
of freezing overnight temperatures posted for Friday morning in
Georgia, Alabama, northwest Florida, most of Mississippi and all
but extreme southeast Louisiana.
   The low temperature for the nation Thursday morning was 8
degrees below zero at Bismarck, N.D.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Fergus Falls, Minn., to 88 degrees at Miami, Fla.

   A veteran police officer killed two
13-year-old boys with a single shotgun blast to their backs after
one of the youths pointed a screwdriver at him and he mistook it
for a gun, authorities said Thursday.
   Thia Yang and Basee Lor, who were suspected of auto theft, were
shot Wednesday with a 12-gauge shotgun fired by Inver Grove Heights
officer Kenneth Murphy, according to Mark Shields, superintendent
of the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.
   ``Officer Murphy, fearing his life was in danger, discharged his
weapon,'' Shields said at a news conference.
   However, the killings angered members of Minnesota's Southeast
Asian community, who said Murphy had used unneccessary force. The
boys' parents, who live in St. Paul, are Hmong immigrants.
   Murphy was placed on paid administrative leave pending a grand
jury investigation, which is expected to open in about three weeks,
said Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom. A special prosecutor
from the state attorney general's office will present the evidence,
he said.
   ``The decision on whether that was justifiable use of deadly
force is up to the grand jury,'' Backstrom said.
   Authorities at the press conference declined to answer questions
about why the boys were shot in the back.
   Yang Vang, director of the Lao Family Community of Minnesota,
charged that the police officer had acted recklessly. Vang said his
center had been receiving telephone calls from outraged Laotian
neighbors.
   ``Members are very, very upset,'' Vang said.
   Ge Yang, coordinator of the Laotian center's delinquency
prevention program, complained that Murphy ``should have known how
to deal with those kids (without) firing a gun.''
   The brief chase involving police from Inver Grove Heights,
Rosemount and Dakota County began at 12:31 p.m. Wednesday when a
Rosemount police squad responded to a report of an auto theft,
according to Shields.
   The pursuit continued after the car went into a ditch in Inver
Grove Heights and three boys fled on foot, he said.
   Murphy, a 20-year veteran, pursued the boys on foot through a
field. He took cover behind a hay wagon, identified himself as a
police officer and shouted at the boys, who fled into five-foot
high raspberry bushes, Shields said. The officer saw Yang raise his
hand with what Murphy thought was a gun, he said.
   Murphy was about 30 yards away from Yang when he shot, and Lor
was about 15 feet behind and to the side of Yang, Shields said.
   ``We don't think the officer even realized that (Lor) was in
such close vicinity,'' he added.
   Yang was shot in the back and upper left shoulder by one of the
nine pellets in the shell, severing his aorta, according to the
Ramsey County coroner.
   Lor was hit by three pellets, one in the arm, one in the spinal
column and another in the stomach, causing severe abdominal
bleeding.
   The third boy, a 14-year-old, was arrested after the shooting,
authorities said.
   Le Yang, Thia Yang's 14-year-old sister, said her brother was an
eighth-grader at Washington Junior High School in St. Paul.
   ``It was their fault _ the police's fault,'' she told the St.
Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch. ``They don't have the right to take
out their gun and shoot him. To me, my brother is a nice guy. He
doesn't fool around; he doesn't do bad things.''
   Inver Grove Heights Mayor William Saed described Murphy as ``a
very stable officer over the years.''
   ``It's very unfortunate for the boys, a real tragedy,'' Saed
said. ``But it's a tragedy for the officer, too. Something must
have happened to cause him to do that.''

pay by more than $30,000 a year over the next 13 months _ to above
$120,000 a year _ while revising ethics rules to put new limits on
outside earnings.
   The bill was passed 252 to 174, just 10 months after intense
public criticism forced the House to reject a larger pay increase.
   The new proposal sped through the House with strong support from
the leaders of both parties and an endorsement from President Bush.
A slight majority of Republicans voting opposed the bill despite
Bush's stance.
   The Senate planned to consider the plan Friday, including
whether to take the same salary increases the House approved for
itsef, government executives and federal judges. With Congress
hoping to adjourn next week, Senate leaders scheduled an unusual
bipartisan caucus for Friday morning to iron things out.
   ``I can understand and sympathize with people in my district who
make 15 and 20 and $30,000 a year who would have trouble
understanding why this kind of pay level is needed,'' said House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``But,'' he told his colleagues, ``in your heart and in your
mind you know it's the right thing to do.''
   Rep. James A. Traficant, D-Ohio, took a different view.
   ``I understand the game _ we come with ethics reform and we
sneak in a pay raise,'' he said.
   The complex 100-page pay and ethics package was announced by
Democratic and Republican leaders Wednesday, but copies were not
made available to the public until debate was well under way
Thursday.
   Public criticism, some of it galvanized by broadcast talk-show
hosts, helped lead to defeat of a proposed 51 percent congressional
pay raise earlier this year. But there was no time this time.
   ``Without public hearings, without a decent interval of time for
the American people to digest it, ... the House leadership
railroaded it through,'' complained consumer advocate Ralph Nader,
who opposes congressional pay increases.
   But Ann McBride, senior vice president of Common Cause, the
self-proclaimed public interest organization, hailed the action as
``moving toward a time when we will have government fully
compensated by the public, and not by special interest influence
money.''
   The bill would increase salaries in the House, for federal
judges, and for top executive branch officials by at least 35
percent and often by closer to 40 percent.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said the Senate
would consider the bill Friday. However, it was not clear what
raises or honoraria limits the Senate might include for itself.
   The Senate could give itself a smaller raise, as it did earlier
this decade. Senators were paid less than House members for about
six months seven years ago before senators approved a catch-up
raise.
   The House bill provides for a 7.9 percent cost-of-living hike by
January. On Jan. 1, 1991, a 25 percent raise would be given _ on
top of whatever cost-of-living increase is given to rank-and-file
civil servants at that time.
   Assuming a 3 percent 1991 civil service raise, House members who
now make $89,500 likely would see their pay increase to about
$125,000.
   However, lawmakers who currently add to their incomes with
honoraria for speeches would have to give that up. Current rules
allow House members to pocket honoraria totaling up to 30 percent
of their salaries, while senators can keep 40 percent.
   Gephardt cited the honoraria rules as a key reform which would
raise public confidence in Congress. He implored House members to
have courage to vote for the package.
   ``We heard a hero yesterday talk to us about courage,'' he said,
recalling Wednesday's congressional address by Polish labor leader
Lech Walesa. ``Today is the day for us to be leaders, to have
courage to do what's right for this body, this institution, and for
this country and its people.''
   Bush, who has been seeking for months to increase salaries for
his top aides and for federal judges, cleared the way for House
action this week. By giving his blessing to the package, he made it
more difficult for Democrats or Republicans to use pay as a
partisan issue.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., co-chairman of the task force that
drafted the package, announced Thursday that the heads of the two
political parties were signing a statement that ``they have no
intention of having it become part of'' the 1990 election dialogue.
   The ethics reforms in the bill stem in part from the case of
former Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, who resigned from the House in
June after the House ethics committee charged him with evading
limits on honoraria income and with accepting improper gifts.
   Foley vowed when he took over the speakership that he would push
an ethics bill to the floor this year, and said it probably would
have to include a pay raise to get members' support.
   The legislation would bar House members from accepting fees for
speeches, but they could suggest their hosts pass on up to $2,000
in the member's name to a charity of the member's choice. The bill
requires members to reveal the donor but not the destination of the
money.
   Income earned outside the House would be limited to 15 percent
of salary beginning in 1991. Members could not receive directors'
fees, legal fees or other income for professional services. Book
royalties would remain exempt from the limits but with new
restrictions.
   The bill also would tighten rules on accepting gifts and on
travel that members may accept.
   ``It says boys and girls, this is a full-time job. Pay attention
to what's going on here. We'll compensate you straight from the
public treasury, right out in the open, but no more side employment
deals,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.

   Dorothy Bartlebaugh always wanted to
walk down the aisle with the man of her dreams, but she never
imagined she would do it in a supermarket _ in the generic section.
   Ms. Bartlebaugh, 38, and Russell Marshall, 46, were married
Thursday night in Aisle 3 at the County Market store, where they
met in July 1988.
   ``It's romantic,'' she said. ``We fell in love with each other
on first sight in the generic section.''
   Ms. Bartlebaugh said she was looking for bargains, not love,
when she met Marshall in the supermarket in this small town 70
miles northeast of Pittsburgh.
   ``I was comparing the prices, and he turned around and started
talking to me,'' she said. ``He said, `Don't I know you from
somewhere?' and I said, `Not really.' I was going to buy some soap
powder and then he started talking to me.''
   The bride and groom wore black pants and white shirts, and the
aisle was decorated with black and white streamers and balloons.
The wedding cake featured a universal pricing code symbol painted
in black and white icing.
   ``Last night we stopped at the County Market and a lady said, `I
can't ever find anything in this store,' '' Ms. Bartlebaugh said.
``I said, `What are you talking about? I found my husband here.' ''

<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Francis Speight, a landscape painter
known for his scenes of Philadelphia and North Carolina, has died.
He was 93.
   Speight died at his Greenville home on Tuesday.
   He was a painter with gentlemanly manners who captured the
cloud-dappled skies of Philadelphia and the looming pines of
Eastern North Carolina with lyrical grace and informality. His
style blended a concern for fleeting effects of light and
atmosphere along with a bedrock sense of place.
   Collectors, dealers and museum officials said his reputation
extended beyond the state and interest was in rising in his work
and life, as well as prices of his paintings.
   His paintings are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in New York, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.
   ``He was more than a regionalist, and his work had an impact
throughout the United States,'' said Richard S. Schneiderman,
director of the North Carolina Museum of Art.
   In Philadelphia, Speight is considered ``one of the most
important painters of the Philadelphia scene,'' said Carl
Jorgensen, the Washington dealer whose gallery represents the
artist. An exhibition of the artist's work opens at the gallery at
the end of the month.
   Speight was born Sept. 11, 1896, in Windsor in Bertie County. As
a boy, he disliked farm chores but showed an aptitude for writing
and drawing. In 1915, Speight enrolled at Wake Forest College and
began taking art lessons at Meredith College.
   In 1920, Speight enrolled at the Corcoran School of Art in
Washington and later went on to the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine
Arts, where he studied under the noted American impressionist
Daniel Garber and became a teacher in 1925.
   His wife, Sarah Blakeslee, is also a landscape painter.
   In addition to his wife, Speight is survived by two children.

<HEAD>Military to Draw Up Platforms for Parties, Register Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling military will dictate the
platforms and register members of the two parties it will permit to
contest elections returning Africa's most populous nation to
democracy, it announced Thursday.
   The moves were the latest by the military to take more control
over the transition to civilian rule. Last month, Maj. Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida, the head of state, rejected each of the 13 parties the
civilian National Election Board had nominated to compete in local
and parliamentary elections.
   Babangida, who seized power from civilian President Shehu
Shagari in 1983 and banned political parties until May, says the
military needs to be involved in even the smallest details of the
transition to civilian rule to avoid tribalism and corruption. The
change-over is set to be completed by Oct. 1, 1992.
   The announcement means the government rejects the platforms
proposed by the civilian election board, which the military had
originally entrusted with registering parties and defining their
platforms. Earlier this week, the board gave Babangida platforms
for a left-center and a right-center party.
   The policy-making Armed Forces Ruling Council said late Thursday
that the party platforms would be written by a council committee
and published within two months. Registration of party members
would begin immediately after the platforms were published.
   In rejecting the 13 parties on Oct. 7, Babangida said none ``had
passed the test as imposed by our vision of a new political order.''
   He said the parties, which had each raised at least $3 million
and gathered petitions of support from the 435 local government
districts, had close ties to past parties that had failed Nigeria.
   Babangida had said the civilian election board would monitor the
election process and polling.
   Babangida said limiting the country to two political parties was
the only way to avoid regional, ethnic or religious divisions. His
government blames factionalism for the failure of previous civilian
governments.
   The general already had banned all former politicians from
taking part, and had extended the ban to officials now in the
government or military.
   Nigeria, an oil-producing nation with a population of 95
million, has seen its economy near collapse from mismanagement,
corruption and falling oil prices. It has been ruled by the
military for 20 of the 29 years it has been independent from
Britain.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers hauled 66 trapped miners to the
surface through a narrow hole Thursday, three days after an
underground flood stranded them in an eastern India coal pit, news
agencies said.
   The search continued for five other miners thought to have been
trapped when water from a subterranean reservoir burst into the pit
100 yards beneath the surface Monday.
   Press Trust of India said the 66 rescued miners were in good
health and had been taken to a hospital for medical checks.
   United News of India said the miners were lifted to the surface
through a rescue hatch drilled to their underground prison in the
government-owned mine near Raniganj. The bore hole was only 24
inches in diameter, and the miners were rescued one at a time in a
specially built capsule lowered down the hole.
   Rescuers had been in voice contact with the miners since shortly
after the disaster and had managed to pass food and water to them
during most of their ordeal.
   The news agencies said at least 1.5 million gallons of water
poured into the pit Monday, blocking the exit shaft of the Mahavir
Colliery 465 miles southeast of New Delhi.

   Here is a state-by-state look at the tornadoes and severe
thunderstorms that have killed at least 27 people, injured more
than 500 and left hundreds homeless since Wednesday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Alabama: Seventeen people were killed in Huntsville on
Wednesday when a tornado touched down just before rush hour,
causing major damage. There were 463 injuries and about 1,000
people left homeless, authorities said. Three people were injured
in an earlier tornado in Clay County in eastern Alabama.
   _District of Columbia: Heavy thunderstorms packing 50-60 mph
winds swept through the Washington area during the Thursday morning
rush hour, flooding some streets. About 10,000 customers lost
power, mostly in the Maryland suburbs. No injuries were reported.
   _Georgia: 19 people were injured, four critically, and at least
200 people were evacuated Wednesday after a tornado struck two
mobile home parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto, about 25
miles southeast of Atlanta.
   _Illinois: Strong winds Wednesday morning destroyed about 15
homes and killed one woman in St. Clair County in southwestern
Illinois. Damage was estimated at $3 million to $5 million.
   _Indiana: A tornado was spotted Wednesday afternoon around
Richmond, close to the Ohio border. It ripped the top off a silo
and tipped a semi-trailer into a ditch. The driver was slightly
injured.
   _Kentucky: The storm Wednesday left at least 28 people injured;
damage was estimated at $2.5 million or more. A storm believed to
have been a tornado cut a mile-long swath of destruction through
the town of Flaherty in Meade County. Damage was also reported in
Bullitt, LaRue, Hardin and Pendleton counties.
   _Maryland, Delaware: Heavy winds on Thursday leveled a church
building in Kent County, Md., lifted roofs from buildings in
Baltimore and cut power to tens of thousands of utility customers,
authorities said. Reports of tornado damage came from Kent County,
Md., and Hockessin, Del. National Weather Service officials were
unable to immediately confirm the reports. No injuries were
reported.
   _Mississippi: Scattered damage and power outages were reported
Wednesday after radar showed tornadoes in Neshoba and Kemper
counties in the east-central portion of the state. No injuries were
reported.
   _New Jersey: High winds and tornadoes were blamed for one death,
at least four injuries and widespread damage and power outages
Thursday. A tornado touched down in Piscataway shortly after noon,
collapsing on house and damaging 10 to 12 others. One person
suffered a minor injury. A bridge connecting Elizabeth with New
York City was closed after two tractor trailers overturned in heavy
winds; one truck driver died and a passenger was injured. Two minor
injuries were reported in Bergen County.
   _New York: A severe thunderstorm Thursday sent a tree crashing
through an elementary school roof in Newburgh, about 60 miles north
of New York City, killing at least seven children and injuring 18,
authorities said. In New York City, a woman was killed by a 12-foot
steel beam that apparently had blown off her apartment's water
tower. Tornadoes were reported in Peekskill, just north of the city.
   _North Carolina: A pair of tornadoes were reported Wednesday in
Henderson County, where a vacant house was destroyed. No injuries
were reported.
   _Ohio: High winds described by local authorities as a tornado
hopscotched across north-central Ohio on Wednesday, ripping roofs
off barns and houses, destroying farm sheds and damaging trailer
homes. One man was hospitalized from a lightning strike and a woman
was slightly injured by flying debris.
   _Pennsylvania: High winds and funnel clouds ripped off roofs and
downed trees in eastern Pennslyvania on Thursday, shattering
windows in Philadelphia skyscrapers. No serious injuries were
reported, but at least 75,000 customers in southeastern
Pennsylvania lost power.
   _South Carolina: A tornado Wednesday downed power lines and
damaged 20 houses near Greenwood. No injuries were reported.
   _West Virginia: High winds knocked over trees, ripped roofs off
houses and toppled a trailer early Thursday in Jefferson County,
just west of Frederick, Md., injuring four members of one family,
two seriously. The National Weather Service said the storm probably
was a tornado.

<HEAD>Gov't Company Fires Hundreds More Strikers, Clashes Injure Six</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police clashed with striking
black workers Thursday and the government-run transport company
fired hundreds more employees demanding nearly 2{ times their
current pay.
   Police said six officers were hurt in two clashes.
   The South African Transport Services said it fired 800 strikers
after dropping 626 from the payroll earlier this week. The company
said the walkout is illegal because rail, trucking and harbor
operations are designated as essential.
   Police headquarters said violence broke out at a railway station
in Germiston, near Johannesburg, when about 50 strikers arrived by
train for a union meeting without having paid their rail fares.
   Officers moved in to arrest the men and were attacked with
sticks, whips and stones, police said. Strikers scattered after
officers fired two pistol shots, according to police, who said
three officers were injured.
   An hour later, three more officers were hurt trying to disperse
about 150 strikers outside a union office in Germiston, according
to police headquarters. No arrests were reported in either incident.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, with which the
transport union is affiliated, said police ``indiscriminately
attacked'' the workers when they got off the train without paying.
   The statement by the congress, the country's largest and most
militantly anti-apartheid trade federation, said police ``brutally
assaulted'' the strikers when they fled to the union offices. The
union said the workers were unable to pay for their train tickets
because they were on strike.
   The dispute centers on a demand by the South African Railways
and Harbor Workers for the minimum wage to be increased to $570 a
month from $230. Other issues in dispute are the union's objection
to possible privatization and the company's refusal to officially
recognize the union.
   The union claims a membership of 40,000 of the total 180,000
black workers employed by the transport company.
   The strike, which has hit mainly the Johannesburg-Pretoria area
and the port city of Durban, is one of two bitter labor disputes
that show no signs of resolution.
   About 6,000 black employees of South African Breweries, the
country's privately owned beer monopoly, have been on strike for
five weeks.
   On Wednesday, the brewery workers' union lowered its wage demand
for the first time, saying it would accept a 32 percent increase
instead of a 38 percent increase. But management maintained its
refusal to change its ``final'' offer of a 16 percent raise.
   Seven deaths have been linked to that strike.
   Police officials also said Thursday that 15 black activists were
arrested for participating in an illegal meeting in Alexandra, a
township adjoining Johannesburg. The meeting followed the
announcement that a magistrate had refused to grant permission for
a protest march in Alexandra on Saturday.
   Organizers hoped 30,000 would join the march to demand new
housing, an end to evictions and the writing off of arrears accrued
during a three-year rent boycott.

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A decision to tape virtually all
telephone calls at state police barracks, including calls made by
suspects to their attorneys, was made by top state police officials
almost three years ago, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   State police memorandums cited by The Hartford Courant
contradict statements made by the former commander of the state
police when he resigned on Sunday.
   Lester J. Forst, who also resigned his post as state public
safety commissioner because of the controversy, said his top
officers weren't aware of the scope of the taping.
   There is no indication in the memorandums, however, that Forst
himself was aware of the taping system, The Courant reported.
   The newspaper also cited inventory documents from February 1987
and 1988 suggesting that state police played back tapes to check
the quality of the recordings. The documents do not make clear if
police played back tapes of client-attorney calls.
   The taping of all calls going in and out of state police
barracks is the subject of FBI and federal grand jury
investigations. Gov. William A. O'Neill has ordered a review of
state and municipal police taping policies and a halt to recording
of attorney-client calls.
   State police have insisted they did not listen to privileged
calls between suspects and their attorneys and have claimed that
the taping system was installed so police could verify details of
calls for help, for example.
   The new state police commander, Bernard R. Sullivan, declined to
comment on the newspaper report and said he would wait until all
investigations are completed.
   State Supreme Court Chief Justice Ellen A. Peters rejected a
request by a state senator for an investigation into whether judges
or lawyers knew of the taping system. Peters said if the senator
had any evidence of that, he should make it public.
   Meanwhile, the state agreed Thursday to a plea-bargain in a
Waterbury trial where the existence of the taping system was first
revealed.
   A Waterbury police detective charged with drunken driving and
manslaughter for hitting a women agreed to plead guilty to
negligent homicide with a motor vehicle and receive a four-month
suspended sentence and one year's probation. The detective's
lawywer had subpoenaed state police officials to testify about the
taping system, but the plea-bargain eliminated that possibility.
   In Wallingford, town attorney Adam Mantzaris said his town's
police may have illegally taped phone conversations in the
department's cellblock. Mayor William W. Dickinson Jr. ordered the
taping halted Tuesday.
   And state police who investigated the case of a teen-age girl
charged in the killing of her mother will be asked to testify in
Hartford Superior Court Friday whether they videotaped or recorded
any conversations of the defendant or other witnesses.
   According to the Courant, a Dec. 3, 1986, memorandum sent by
Dominick Console, the civilian telecommunications chief for the
department, to Lt. Henry Bourgeois, commanding officer of the state
police communications center, said it was ``time to remind the top
management'' about the taping system and to decide what lines
should be recorded.
   A meeting apparently was held a week later on the matter.
   A memorandum dated Dec. 12, 1986, from Capt. Ronald P. Mikulka,
commanding officer of technological support services, to Bourgeois
and Console, said:
   ``In accordance with a decision reached at the Dec. 10, 1986,
Staff Meeting all telephone lines are to be recorded. The only
exception will be the Troop Lieutenant's private line.''
   The memorandum instructs them to ``make arrangements to obtain
and distribute appropriate labels to be affixed to Troop phones
which will notify users that all lines are taped.''
   The stickers never reached most telephones in police barracks
and a policy requiring troopers to tell anyone using the telephones
that their conversations would be recorded was never developed, The
Courant said.

   Thousands of residents strolled along the
newly intact San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge on Thursday, saluting
the workers who got it back in shape just a month after the
earthquake.
   The bridge is ``part of the family,'' said Frank LaFontaine, 59,
of Daly City, who uses it to visit friends in the East Bay. ``You
really miss it.''
   Repaired at a cost of about $2.5 million, the bridge is slated
to reopen to traffic at 11:59 p.m. Friday _ one month to the day
after the devastating Oct. 17 quake _ if all goes well. But
officials decided a formal reopening celebration was in order and
invited people to travel the bridge on foot Thursday.
   The ceremony featured crooner Tony Bennett singing his trademark
``I Left My Heart In San Francisco,'' a Navy band with the national
anthem, and appearances by Gov. George Deukmejian, San Francisco
Mayor Art Agnos and Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson.
   About 9,200 people purchased $6 tickets for a bus ride to
locations at either end of the bridge. Profits were slated for
quake relief.
   ``I was on a bus when the bridge broke, about 150 yards from
where it broke,'' recalled Susan Palumbo, 42, of San Francisco as
she stood on the bridge Thursday. The bus' occupants had to walk
off the bridge, she said.
   ``It was scary. I didn't feel the quake, but I waited for the
aftershock to take the bridge down. I feel safe now,'' she said.
   The bridge, one of the most-traveled in the world, was carrying
an average of more than 260,000 vehicles every work day before the
quake, which caused a 50-foot section of the upper deck to
collapse. It opened 53 years ago this week, on Nov. 12, 1936.
   At the ceremony, Deukmejian thanked the people who ``have been
working around the clock seven days a week in order for us to open
up this bridge to help the literally millions of people who have
depended upon it.''
   He said the reopening of would have ``a positive impact on the
spirit of all of the people in the Bay area and throughout
California.''
   Meanwhile, a panel of engineers said the repairs have made the
bridge as strong as it was before the 7.1 temblor, but said that
another, similar quake would seriously damage the span again.
   ``Mother Nature performed an experiment that showed (the bridge)
was not designed adequately,'' warned geologist Robert E. Wallace,
chairman of the Bay Conservation and Development Commission's
Engineering Criteria Review Board.
   ``It failed in a very distant earthquake,'' he said. The quake
was centered in the Santa Cruz Mountains about 70 miles to the
south.
   The ceremony was held near the spot where the section of bridge
collapsed, smashing into the lower deck. One person died when the
car she was in fell into the gap.
   The crowds were not allowed on the actual section that fell,
because concrete was in its last stages of hardening, officials
said.
   Shortly after the quake, California Department of Transportation
officials had said they hoped to have the bridge reopened by
Thanksgiving.
   In the past month, commuters who normally drove the bridge to
work had to travel longer, slower alternate routes or use mass
transit.
   The Bay Area Rapid Transit system, which has an underground tube
under the bay, has set records during the bridge closure, with as
many as 345,000 passengers riding BART trains some days.

<TEXT>
   Conservative Fernando Collor de Mello on
Thursday was virtually guaranteed a berth in a runoff election for
president, and two leftist rivals battled for the second spot.
   Official and TV network tallies gave Collor de Mello about 26
percent of the vote and an ample lead in Wednesday's election, the
first free presidential balloting in 29 years.
   With his elegant suits and good looks, the 40-year-old former
governor of the tiny northeastern state of Alagoas campaigned on a
clean-government program that captured the imagination of many poor
Brazilians, most of whom earn less than $25 a week.
   None of the candidates was expected to obtain a majority, and a
runoff between the top two finishers was scheduled for Dec. 17.
   In Washington, the State Department said it was ``a truly
significant day'' for Brazil. Spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler likened
the elections to the developments sweeping Eastern Europe.
   ``In considering the spread of democracy into other regions such
as Eastern Europe, we should also take note of what occurred in
Brazil yesterday,'' she said in a statement.
   ``We congratulate the people of Brazil on what has been a truly
significant day in their history,'' she said. ``We look forward to
working with whomever they choose in the upcoming runoff election
to be their next president.''
   Official and TV network counts gave Collor de Mello a wide lead
over radical-leftist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and rival populist
Leonel Brizola in Wednesday's balloting.
   An unofficial tally by Brazil's largest TV network, Globo TV _
which said it independently counted 57.3 percent of the returns
from the country's 82 million registered voters _ gave Collor de
Mello 12.5 million votes, or 26.5 percent of the total.
   Brizola, of the center-left Democratic Labor Party, was
comfortably in second place with 8.6 million votes, or 18.3
percent, the network said.
   Da Silva, a former union president of the Marxist-oriented
Workers Party, was trailing in third with 7.5 million votes, about
16 percent.
   The government's official vote-counting center, far behind
unofficial tallies because of apparent computer problems, issued
partial results showing da Silva in second.
   It said that with only 20.68 percent of the votes counted,
Collor de Mello was leading with 26.91 percent, da Silva was second
with 17.27 percent, and Brizola was third with 15.91 percent.
   Those were the last official results to be issued Thursday.
   The impending runoff raised the possibility of an alliance
between the leftist candidates to defeat Collor de Mello. The two
insulted each other during the campaign and dismissed the idea of
joining forces.
   Brizola overtook da Silva on Thursday in the Globo TV count.
Network analysts said Brizola's surge was due to a predicted strong
showing in the heavily populated states of Rio de Janeiro and Rio
Grande do Sul, where he was governor.
   However, Globo TV analysts said da Silva, a charismatic labor
leader backed by the progressive wing of Brazil's powerful Roman
Catholic Church, could close the gap when votes from remote
interior precincts came in.
   Sen. Mario Covas, of the left-of-center Brazilian Social
Democracy Party, was fourth with 5.2 million votes in the network
count but was not expected to overtake Brizola or da Silva.
   The Supreme Electoral Court released an official partial result
Thursday night based on only 12 percent of the votes counted. It
showed Collor de Mello leading with 2.4 million votes, da Silva
second with around 1.6 million, and Brizola third with some 1.5
million votes.
   Mauricio Mello, head of the Electoral Court's computer systems,
said the final tally would be announced in five days.
   Collor de Mello, who had led in polls since April, has sharply
criticized President Jose Sarney, calling the 59-year-old leader
corrupt and incompetent, and blaming him for Brazil's 1,300 percent
inflation. Sarney, who by law cannot run for re-election, said he
will sue the candidate for slander.
   The new president takes office March 15 for a five-year term.
   Brazil's last direct presidential election was in 1960, when
Janio Quadros was elected. Quadros quit after seven months in
office, and three years later the Armed Forces took power in a
right-wing coup.
   The generals banned direct voting for presidential election,
although limited regional elections were allowed. Sarney, a
civilian, took office in 1985 in an electoral college controlled by
the generals.

   An American woman and two West German
friends were reported safe Thursday, the day after a previously
unknown group claimed to have kidnapped them. Police said they had
not been abducted.
   The three sailed from the Christian port of Jounieh north of
Beirut aboard a ferry for the Cypriot port of Larnaca, police and
port officials said. They arrived at the Lebanese harbor and
refused to talk to reporters as they boarded.
   Police said Deborah Fahrend, 54, of San Francisco; Lebanese-born
naturalized West German Mounir Shamseddin Sami, 39; and his
7-year-old son Danjel, born in Berlin, were not kidnapped.
   A police spokesman, whose name cannot be revealed because of
regulations, said the case ``involved a robbery report.''
   ``We are investigating to find out what whether they were robbed
or their passports were just stolen,'' he said, and refused to
elaborate.
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday that U.S.
consular officials want to question Ms. Fahrend. Spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said West German officials had told Washington
the three were ``free and safe.''
   ``Our consular officer, wherever she surfaces, will definitely
want to have a little _ meet her,'' said Miss Tutwiler.
   A statement Wednesday claimed a group called The Organization of
Just Revenge kidnapped the three ``because of their activities in
Lebanon.'' The 30-word typewritten statement in Arabic was put in
the mailbox of a Western news agency along with photocopies of
their passports and visas.
   Both the police spokesman and Wolfgang Gottelmann, the West
German ambassador, said Ms. Fahrend and the Samis were in good
health and planned to leave by sea for Larnaca, Cyprus, when
weather permitted. They would not say where the three were staying
in Jounieh.
   The U.S. Embassy in Beirut has been closed since Sept. 22.
   Gottelmann said by telephone: ``They are free. They presented
themselves this morning at the consular section of the embassy
after they had read the reports.
   ``They had not been robbed. They were already back in east
Beirut to return to Cyprus when the claim was issued. They had come
to Lebanon to see the man's family.''
   ``The American lady was a friend of the family,'' the ambassador
said. ``They cannot explain how this happened. I doubted this thing
from the beginning.''
   A Sami family source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the three telephoned from the West German Embassy in east Beirut to
say they were fine.
   According to the relative, Mounir Sami said they were ``robbed
by gunmen'' but ``he didn't say where they were robbed. It seems
those who robbed them also took their passports, photocopied them
and issued the claim hoping to make some money.''
   The photocopies showed they arrived in Jounieh by sea from
Larnaca on Nov. 3.
   Ms. Fahrend's mother, Margaret Brooks, said in the United States
her daughter had planned to write a book about Lebanon and said in
a letter last week: ``It seems to me to be a chance in a lifetime.''
   She said her daughter chose the name Fahrend, which means
``travel'' in German, about three years ago. Her name previously
was Corra, from the husband she divorced about 20 years ago.
   Neighbors said Sami, his son and Ms. Fahrend spent 10 days at
the apartment of his parents in the Bourj Abu Haidar district of
Moslem west Beirut and left on Tuesday.
   ``They told me they were heading for Jounieh to leave Lebanon
and I was under the impression that they did,'' said Ibtisam Malak,
a 40-year-old housewife and neighbor of the Samis. ``I was amazed
when I heard radios this morning saying they were kidnapped.''
   Eighteen Western hostages, including eight Americans, are held
in Lebanon, most by radical Shiite Moslem factions loyal to Iran.
   Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   A violent storm that spun tornadoes across the South and Midwest
blew north Thursday, knocking a cafeteria wall down on top of
lunching schoolchildren in upstate New York. The two-day toll was
at least 27 dead and hundreds injured.
   The cafeteria cave-in claimed the lives of seven children near
Newburgh, N.Y., and deaths also were reported in New York City, New
Jersey and Illinois. Seventeen people died Wednesday in Huntsville,
Ala., when a tornado packing 250 mph winds struck virtually without
warning, laying waste to a wide swath of the city.
   The storm churned around a collision of record warm air and
extremely cold air. The result was tornadoes and unusually severe
thunderstorms.
   By far the worst damage was in Huntsville, where an estimated
1,000 people were left homeless and National Guardsmen stood watch
against looting Thursday.
   No bodies were believed left in the rubble, but portions of the
city resembled a bombing target. A shopping center and clusters of
apartment buildings were leveled. Cars were piled atop each other.
Utility poles had been snapped like twigs.
   The National Weather Service said the tornado path had covered
between eight and 10 miles and that its wind speeds were as high as
250 mph.
   ``It's like taking six to 10 city blocks and putting them in a
blender and putting it on liquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob Caraway.
   As the storm moved north on Thursday, it knocked over trees and
ripped the the roofs off houses in West Virginia, injuring four
members of one family, two seriously. The storm also caused
flooding in Washington, D.C., blew the windows out of skyscrapers
in Philadelphia and destroyed a house in Piscataway, N.J.
   A truck driver died when his tractor-trailer overturned in high
winds on a bridge connecting Elizabeth, N.J., and New York City. A
New York City woman died after being hit by a steel beam blown off
a water tower.
   In Wyckoff, N.J., high winds knocked a power line onto a gas
line, sparking a fire that forced the evacuation of 20 homes,
according to police. No houses were burned.
   The cafeteria collapse occurred at the East Coldenham Elementary
School in Newburgh at about 12:30 p.m., when from 113 to 125
students in first, second and third grades were eating lunch, said
Newburgh police Chief John Kulisek.
   State Police and survivors said they believed the school was hit
by a tornado, but the National Weather Service said it could not
confirm that until investigators went to the scene.
   The center section of a cinder-block and glass wall fell in on
the cafeteria, showering the pupils with glass and concrete.
   ``You are talking about huge concrete blocks that fell on top of
the kids,'' state police Lt. Robert Hughes said.
   Seven children ages 7 and 8 were killed and 18 others were
injured, four critically, officials said.
   In eastern Connecticut, more than 75,000 Northeast Utilities
customers lost power in the afternoon, and 18,000 remained without
power at 9 p.m., spokeman Jeffery Kotkin said.
   Tornadoes were reported Wednesday in Mississippi, Alabama,
Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Kentucky, Ohio and
Indiana. A severe thunderstorm in Illinois claimed one life and
caused several million dollars in damage.
   Altogether, the storms were blamed for at least 27 deaths and
more than 500 injuries over the two days.
   In Alabama, Gov. Guy Hunt said he would ask President Bush to
declare Huntsville a disaster area to open the door to millions of
dollars in federal relief. Mayor Steve Hettinger said no firm
damage estimates were expected until Friday, but he put the number
of homeless at 1,000.
   Hunt assigned nearly 200 Guardsmen to assist in the cleanup and
help law officers guard against looting. Police spokeswoman Susan
Williamson said there had been minor looting the night of the storm
but no arrests.
   The temperature, which had risen to 73 before the storm
Wednesday, plunged into the 30s early Thursday while rescuers
worked through the night under the glare of floodlights.
   The lights, powered by generators, produced an eerie glow in a
area that was otherwise largely without power. Tall cranes lifted
the heavy rubble, while workers with flashlights picked through the
smaller pieces.
   As daybreak came, people began returning to the scene, some to
look for valuables in ravaged cars or businesses, others simply out
of curiosity. Many carried cameras or videocassette recorders.
   Police Maj. Robert Moder said there was no indication that
anyone was left in the rubble.
   ``We don't have any reports of people missing,'' he said
Thursday morning.
   Moder said 463 people were injured and more than 150 of those
required at least overnight hospital treatment. Authorities had
said 19 people were killed but later lowered the death toll by two.
   All but one of the victims, who ranged in age from 7 to 67, were
killed along Airport Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that seemed to
be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march. The other victim
perished on the city's outskirts, authorities said.
   Most of the dead were in apartments and stores that were torn
into twisted wreckage, or in cars blown off the pavement.
   The tornado seemed to catch everyone by surprise.
   ``It was fast,'' said Lucy Lee Rusk, who moved to a Red Cross
shelter after her apartment was battered by debris. ``It was like
one big pop and that's when everything went.''
   The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm
warning at 3:54 p.m., but the tornado struck with no real warning,
said Brenda Page of the service's office. A tornado warning was
broadcast at 4:39 p.m., two minutes after the twister was sighted
on the ground at the old Huntsville airport.
   Ms. Page said radar showed a strong storm but not the conditions
usually visible during tornadoes.
   Danny Cooper, director of the Alabama Emergency Management
Agency, said three people were seriously injured in an earlier
tornado that hit a home in Clay County in eastern Alabama. He said
a tornado in northwestern Alabama's Lauderdale County destroyed
three homes.
   Alabama Power Co. reported Thursday that violent winds had
battered the switchyard of the Farley Nuclear Power Plant near
Dothan on Wednesday night, causing about three gallons of
concentrated PCBs to spill. A spokesman said no one was injured,
the nuclear plant was not affected and a cleanup of the
cancer-causing chemicals was under way.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa declared
Thursday ``the Iron Curtain is no more'' but also said the West
will be to blame if Poland's experiment in democracy fails for lack
of economic support.
   ``If we do not succeed in evolution, a revolution may come,''
Walesa told a packed luncheon at the National Press Club before
leaving for New York on the next leg of his weeklong visit to the
United States.
   Lionized during four days in the nation's capital, Walesa met
with President Bush, addressed a joint session of Congress and
received the cheers of U.S. labor leaders. The president hailed him
as ``America's special guest'' and Congress gave him repeated
standing ovations.
   He also found time to tape a 30-second commercial for the
AFL-CIO's ``Union Yes'' advertising campaign. In the ad he speaks
in Polish, through a translator, until the end when he grins,
switches to English and gives the ``Union Yes'' slogan.
   The taping took about 90 minutes, partly because Walesa had such
trouble pronouncing ``union.''
   In Manhattan on Thursday night, the 1983 Nobel Peace Prize
winner received a Freedom Award from the International Rescue
Committee, a nonsectarian, voluntary agency that runs relief,
medical and resettlement for refugees fleeing political, religious
or racial persecution.
   Past Freedom Award recipients included Winston Churchill, George
Meany, Hubert Humphrey and Elie Wiesel.
   Walesa told an estimated 700 government officials, diplomats,
industrial leaders and private citizens at the award dinner:
``Please care for this country, because this country is a beacon of
hope for people elsewhere.''
   At the press club earlier, Walesa repeated his call for
Americans to invest in Poland to protect the fragile beginnings of
democracy. Walesa said he would not be to blame if the peaceful
evolution degenerates into chaos.
   ``I will defend myself and ... my defense will be as follows:
   ``We have done everything. We have fulfilled all your conditions
and we have stretched out our hands. But there was no other hand to
take it.''
   Animated despite his hectic schedule, the Solidarity leader
bantered with his press club audience and said Polish reforms so
far represent ``a beautiful house of cards'' that will not survive
without ``economic concrete.''
   ``The Iron Curtain is no more,'' declared Walesa, an emissary
for the East bloc's first non-communist led government.
   ``We have fought and we have won. But the victory is mostly a
theoretical victory. I call it a beautiful house of cards.
   ``Any wind could destroy this house of cards. If we want a real
victory we need to build a strong foundation under it by pouring
economic concrete.''
   ``We want to make business deals,'' said Walesa, who met earlier
in the day with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter and representatives of a dozen American
corporations.
   At their meeting earlier, Mosbacher declared Walesa an honorary
Texan and presented him a white Stetson hat.
   ``All heroes, all good guys wear white hats,'' said Mosbacher, a
former Houston businessman.
   Asked at the luncheon if he had achieved everything he wanted
during the visit, Walesa referred to his one passion outside of
Solidarity _ fishing.
   ``Obviously ladies and gentlemen, you have to remember that I am
like a fisherman. I caught a fish this big,'' he said, first
stretching out his arm, then gesturing with his hand a catch only
the size of his forearm.
   The crowd guffawed.
   ``I talk a lot, I ask for a lot, and of course I already know
that I cannot accomplish everything, that the results will be
limited.''
   But he added a few minutes later:
   ``It seems to me that I am being received with great sympathy
and with understanding. ... So there is a chance that we will
succeed. I hope that the fish will be a larger one than the one I
have shown.''
   Congress was taking steps this week to help finance the Polish
reforms, as the Senate voted Tuesday to authorize $657 million in
economic aid to Poland over three years and $81 million for nearby
Hungary, which also is dismantling its centrally controlled economy.
   The House went further, approving an initial one-year
installment of $533 million for the two Soviet bloc nations.

<TEXT>
   Warplanes bombed rebel
positions in parts of San Salvador and troops battled guerrillas
block by block Thursday in efforts to break the largest offensive
of the decade-old civil war.
   Armed men meanwhile entered the grounds of Jose Simeon Canas
Central American University before dawn and killed and mutilated
six Jesuit priests, their housekeeper and her 15-year-old daughter.
   The government denied responsibility for the killings and said
an investigation was under way. In Washington, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater condemned the killings as ``outrageous.''
   Reports on fighting in the countryside were sketchy, but at
least 800 people have died and 1,600 have been wounded since the
offensive in all 14 provinces began Saturday night.
   President Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala proposed Thursday that the
Organization of American States send a delegation to El Salvador to
negotiate a cease-fire. He said such a truce should be supervised
by U.N. forces.
   Guerrilla leaders have acknowledged they cannot win the
10-year-old war militarily but launched the offensive to prove the
army also could not win and that rightist President Alfredo
Cristiani would be unable to govern without a role in government
for their Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
   Although only 1,500 guerrillas are thought to be involved in the
attack in San Salvador, the entire capital of 1 million people
seemed besieged. Virtually nothing was open and the sounds of
combat were everywhere. A-37 attack jets screamed overhead,
followed by thundering explosions as bombs dropped.
   ``We were caught in the crossfire,'' said Angel Erazo, clutching
a kitten on one hand and a bag of clothes in the other. ``It was a
horrible night.''
   Residents of one neighborhood who had been without food for days
looted a marketplace.
   ``We have no food, no money, nowhere to go,'' sobbed Adilia
Hernandez, from Zacamil, a northern neighborhood held by the
guerrillas since Saturday night.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights group, said
50 civilians took refuge Thursday in a suburban church. The church
was surrounded by troops and there are three Jesuit priests inside,
the rights group said. The report could not immediately be
independently confirmed.
   Uniformed security officers late Thursday raided a downtown
office of the Lutheran Church and arrested 12 foreigners, including
four U.S. citizens, who work with the church, said Michel Gagne, a
consular officer in the Canadian Embassy.
   Gagne said the foreigners, who included a Canadian and a West
German minister, were detained by the Treasury Police, but the
police would not confirm the report.
   He identified the Americans arrested as Paula Brentlinger, a
physician, and Thomas Gabriel, a nurse, both from Seattle; Bradley
Fields, a social worker from San Diego and Paul Fitch, a volunteer
whose hometown was unknown.
   Earlier Thursday, a priest quoted two witnesses as saying
uniformed government troops killed the six Roman Catholic priests.
The government denied the accusation and said the the crime was
``intended to destablize the democratic process and increase even
more the climate of anguish'' created by the rebel offensive.
   The guerrilla offensive was launched three days after the
guerrillas canceled peace talks with the government following a
Oct. 30 terrorist bombing that left 10 dead at a union hall.
   The guerrillas called for an uprising to topple Cristiani. The
U.S.-backed government has declared the rebel offensive a failure
and insisted the guerrillas do not control any significant
territory.
   Thousands of Salvadorans have been forced to flee their houses
and many have said they blame the guerrillas for their misery.
   The slayings at Central American University were the most
significant mass killing since 1980, when seven leftist politicians
and three U.S. nuns and a lay worker were killed by government
forces.
   Those killings helped kick off a cycle of violence that has led
to more than 70,000 deaths, including tens of thousands killed by
right-wing death squads.
   On Thursday, the rebels appeared to have taken new ground in the
northern neighborhood of Mejicanos, but fell back in Soyapango on
the eastern side of the city. Fighting also continued in Zacamil,
on the north.
   Several hundred guerrilla fighters had moved down overnight from
the heights above Mejicanos, another northern neighborhood. They
were in control of the main streets Thursday, including a market
that besieged residents began looting.
   In Soyapango, the guerrillas appeared to have backed down after
intense house-to-house combat, but the entire capital seemed under
fire. The sounds of combat were everywhere. The government has
imposed a state of siege and a curfew, and the rebels have declared
a ban on all traffic.
   The guerrillas, estimated to have 7,000 full-time fighters and
11,000 backups nationwide, are heavily outnumbered by the
56,000-strong Salvadoran army and other security forces.

shops today looking for more victims of a tornado that carved a
3-mile stretch of destruction, killing 19 people, injuring 300 and
leaving 500 homeless.
   The tornado was one of a series that touched down Wednesday in
an arc stretching from Mississippi to Kentucky to the Carolinas.
Rescue teams with cranes and floodlights searched for injured or
dead, hampered by plummeting temperatures, wind-whipped rain and
jumbles of smashed concrete, twisted metal and cars heaped 10 to 14
feet high.
   ``It's total destruction where the tornado hit. Cars are piled
on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to
be,'' said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in
Montgomery.

   Salt, long believed a cause of high blood
pressure, may have the opposite effect on some people on strict
low-salt diets, a study says. But other doctors insist it's still
better to keep your hands off the shaker.
   Dr. Brent Egan, director of the hypertension unit at the Medical
College of Wisconsin, said his study suggests that strictly
limiting salt intake could be bad for people with normal blood
pressure. He said he believes that the American Heart Association's
suggestion of limiting daily salt consumption to 7 grams, or about
1{ teaspoons, is safe.
   But he said further study is necessary before more stringent
rules are adopted for the general population. ``I think there are
some people who are harmed by severe to moderate salt restriction,
at least in the short term,'' said Egan, who based his findings on
a diet experiment.

   Leftist guerrillas repelled
repeated army assaults around the capital in the fifth day of their
biggest offensive in years, but government troops drove insurgents
from other districts.
   Though the government held an advantage in numbers and weaponry,
many rebel units held their ground in fierce fighting Wednesday
while others, forced into retreat, regrouped to strike again.
   More than 680 soldiers, rebels and civilians have been killed
and another 1,600 wounded in the pitched fighting since the
offensive was launched Saturday, according to hospital, morgue and
government sources. Among them, at least 100 civilians have been
killed and 800 injured, the sources said. The fighting has been
concentrated in densely populated working-class districts on the
capital's outskirts.

   Lech Walesa, hailed by President Bush as
``America's special guest'' and applauded by a joint meeting of
Congress, told The Associated Press that U.S. promises to help
Poland make him an ``optimist'' that the Solidarity government will
survive.
   Walesa addressed a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday and
was welcomed with cheers, whistles and standing ovations as he told
lawmakers, ``this aid will not be wasted and will never be
forgotten.''
   Bush, who has been criticized by Democrats for not promising
enough aid to Poland, appeared with Walesa at an AFL-CIO convention
and called for a national effort for the survival of the first
non-communist government in the Soviet Bloc.

   Trying to keep pace with the changes sweeping
Europe, the Italian Communist Party has taken a revolutionary step
of its own.
   After months of debate, party leader Achille Occhetto has put
the machinery in motion to drop the word ``Communist'' from the
party name, eliminate the hammer and sickle from its symbol and
present the skeleton as a new force grouping leftist parties.
Occhetto is hoping the change will reverse the party's sagging
political fortunes and end the stigma that has kept it out of the
national government for 42 years.
   It is a gamble that could change the political map in a country
where one party, the Christian Democrats, has led or dominated all
governments since the end of World War II.

   Owen Ryan envisioned ``Party Animals'' as a fun
way to market wheat and sesame-seed party crackers shaped like
ducks, deer, pigs and rabbits.
   What he got was a dogged legal scrap with beer giant
Anheuser-Busch Inc., which sued Ryan, contending that people would
confuse the crackers with its beer-promoting mascot, Spuds
MacKenzie, ``The Original Party Animal.''
   ``This is financial bullying and harassment, plain and simple.
It's like a bully who goes to a playground and wants to take your
ball because he's bigger,'' said Ryan, founder of Owen Ryan and
Associates, a marketing and consulting company in New York.
   ``Can you believe that pooch can bite so hard?'' he said. ``But
every dog has its day.''
   Anheuser-Busch, which makes 78.5 million barrels of Budweiser
and other beer a year and controls 40 percent of the U.S. beer
market, declined comment through its attorneys and Peter Fowler of
Fleischman Hillard, a public relations company.
   Ryan said the dogfight pits a pipsqueak businessman with five
employees and no mascot against a company with $9.7 billion in
annual sales, 41,000 employees and Spuds, an English bull terrier
who has promoted beer, stuffed animals, beach towels, T-shirts and
hats since April 1985.
   Ryan says he has been unable to market his party crackers
because leery manufacturers want all the legal questions resolved
first, and a protracted battle could last years.
   ``They're using the courts to restrict competition,'' Ryan said.
``This is a free country. My product should have the opportunity to
succeed or fail in the marketplace. We want the ability to market
without this cloud hanging over our head.''
   Anheuser-Busch sued in February 1988 to stop use of the ``Party
Animals'' trademark, arguing that the snack food could be confused
with the products of one of its subsidiaries, Eagle Snacks Inc. In
court papers, the brewer said it ``believes that it will be
damaged.''
   But the courts already have ruled the trademarks and products
are distinguishable.
   ``There is no likelihood of confusion,'' according to a
three-member panel of the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board,
which dismissed part of the brewer's claim in a summary judgment
given May 30.
   However, the board said a trial would be needed to decide one
remaining question under interstate commerce law _ whether Ryan
ever actually marketed his crackers to consumers. Ryan claims the
issue is a technicality, but Anheuser-Busch has filed stacks of
legal motions against Ryan in an attempt to keep him from using the
name.
   Ryan said he first used his trademark on Aug. 15, 1987. He
argued that the term ``party animal'' was generically defined in
1983 by the Dictionary of American Slang and has been used by Walt
Disney Studios, Tiffany &amp; Co. jewelers and greeting card makers and
by others to describe politicians such as John Tower.
   His lawyer thinks it's a case of a little guy getting into a
corporate giant's doghouse.
   ``Spuds is a pit bull who won't loosen his grip,'' said Jay
Begler, Ryan's attorney. ``The court has already said that people
who see an animal cracker shaped like a duck aren't going to think
of Spuds MacKenzie. But they don't want to let go.
   ``I think this is something the American public can sink its
teeth into, if you'll pardon the expression,'' Begler said.
   Trademarks are jealously guarded by companies that spend
millions of dollars to cultivate symbols so the public can identify
with a product, whether it's beer, cars, fast food or clothes.
   Anheuser-Busch lost a 1984 case after suing the Florist
Association of Greater Cleveland for trademark infringement and
unfair competition because it sold stems with the slogan ``This
Bud's For You.''
   The court sided with the florists, saying consumers would not
confuse beer with flowers. It also said the promotion of rosebuds
did not disparage the beer producer or its product.
   Ryan has promised to keep fighting. He formed a ``Party Animals
Defense Fund'' to help pay his legal costs.
   ``Psychologically, there are times I've just felt blown away,''
he said. ``But this is my livelihood, and I'm just not a quitter.
   ``If that dog wants another black eye, he's come to the right
guy.''

<HEAD>No Surprise in US Response to German Surprises</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Berlin Wall went up, the initial
response from John F. Kennedy's White House was as cautious as
President Bush was when it began coming down 28 years later.
   Kennedy was silent, Bush subdued. Kennedy faced a crisis that
threatened Cold War explosion; he had to worry about war. Bush
seemed bent on playing down any celebration of victory for the
West, lest the United States seem to be crowing.
   In both cases, the administrations clearly were taken by
surprise by abrupt moves on the Communist side, one adverse, one
welcomed.
   Democrats have criticized Bush for what they say is too timid a
response now; some Republicans complained in 1961 that Kennedy was
not responding forcefully enough to a Soviet threat that seemed to
imperil western access to West Berlin.
   That access and the freedom of West Berlin _ not the wall _ was
the issue that threatened major East-West confrontation.
   Aug. 13, 1961, was a brilliant midsummer Sunday at Hyannis Port,
on Cape Cod, and Kennedy was headed for an afternoon cruise when
word came that the Communists had sealed the border of East Berlin
and started building a barbed-wire barricade.
   He was briefed by his military and security aides, then resumed
his weekend holiday and spent five hours cruising Nantucket Sound
with his family. His spokesman said there would be no comment on
Berlin.
   Back at the White House the following week, Kennedy put U.S.
forces on alert, ordered a partial callup of military reservists,
and sent 1,500 soldiers to reinforce the U.S. garrison in West
Berlin. He said later that the troops were hostage to America's
intent to maintain access to West Berlin.
   While the United States denounced the border closing and the
barricades that halted a flood of refugees and locked East Germans
into their Communist state, the crisis centered on Soviet demands
and statements that seemed to threaten western highway and air
routes to West Berlin, across 110 miles of East German territory.
   Kennedy sent Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson to West Berlin to
declare that the United States would fight if necessary to defend
freedom there, and to greet the troops, convoyed across East German
territory without incident on Aug. 20, 1961.
   There were to be more Soviet threats to impede western access to
Berlin, but it was not blocked.
   The wall became a symbol of oppression, Western protests a
litany. It went up in 1961 because East Germans were fleeing their
communist country, about 3,000 of them a day. It was reopened this
month by an East German government seeking to stem a new wave of
refugees, and hoping that free travel would persuade many of them
not to flee.
   From Kennedy's day to this, every American president has
challenged the Communists to tear down their wall. Bush did so in
Mainz, West Germany, last spring.
   But when the border was opened, Bush's response was bland and
bureaucratic. It was as though he had decided to play it safe by
playing it down, and overdid the role. He called the reopening a
dramatic happening for freedom and said he was elated, although he
didn't look it. ``I'm just not an emotional kind of a guy,'' he
explained.
   In televised contrast came the indelible image of John F.
Kennedy in West Berlin, calling the divided city a symbol of
freedom everywhere, declaring in a Boston accent that he took pride
in proclaiming ``Ich bin ein Berliner.'' That Kennedy speech was
replayed again and again as the Berlin Wall came open. It was not
an early response to the wall. Kennedy delivered it on June 26,
1963, nearly two years after the Communists walled in East Berlin.
   In the days after the border was sealed in 1961, the
administration accused the Soviet Union of cynically and
irresponsibly sealing the eastern sector of Berlin in violation of
the agreement among the World War II allies.
   ``I don't feel the situation in East Berlin is satisfactory in
any way,'' Kennedy said at a news conference on Aug. 30. ``And we
have made clear that we have _ do not consider it satisfactory.''
   Eloquence came later.
   Bush has said that he will be imaginative yet prudent in dealing
with the new situation in the East. So far the emphasis has been on
prudence.
   The administration has offered to help West Germany house and
care for refugees. There have been no major policy moves.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell urged Bush to go to
West Berlin to express American exhilaration. The White House said
Bush has no such plans. Sen. Robert J. Dole of Kansas, the
Republican leader, complained about an ``increasing level of
Democratic carping'' at Bush's actions and words on Eastern Europe.
   ``We have no apologies or concern with anything that we've done
at this point,'' said White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
``I would simply say that all the actions that we have taken thus
far ... we believe have been appropriate, have not been offensive,
and have had the desired effect of offering our support without
inciting revolution or other actions that would take the process
backwards.''

   Economist Nicole Ballenger says north-south
agricultural trade in the Western Hemisphere is heating up and
talks to liberalize global rules could add more fuel to the flames.
   The global talks are part of the so-called Uruguay Round under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and are scheduled to
conclude by the end of next year.
   Much of the controversy in the talks has centered on the U.S.
quest for phasing out trade-distorting agricultural subsidies and
other impediments to free trade.
   The U.S. goal has drawn some support, at least in principle, but
has been sharply criticized by others, including the 12-nation
European Economic Community, which has been lambasted for years by
U.S. critics for its big farm subsidies, protective import
restrictions and subsidized exports.
   Ballenger, who is assigned to the Agriculture Department's
Economic Research Service, speaks of another dimension, namely the
rising competition among Western Hemisphere countries in the
agricultural export market.
   U.S. trade problems in the hemisphere have increased in the
1980s, turning a relatively placid situation into ``a sometimes
stormy mix of changing relationships,'' Ballenger says.
   Countries that once were only customers or sources of U.S.
agricultural imports now challenge American traders for shares in
world soybean and grain markets. The United States remains the
biggest farm exporter and importer in the hemisphere, but
significant shifts already have occurred.
   ``For example, until 1980, the United States had a growing
positive agricultural trade balance with its most important trading
partner, Canada,'' Ballenger says in this month's Farmline
magazine. ``Since 1983, however, the U.S. trade balance with Canada
has deteriorated, and in 1985 it turned negative.''
   On the export side of agricultural trade, the United States has
faced growing competition since 1980 from Western Hemisphere
countries, particularly Argentina and Brazil.
   ``These countries have boosted their food exports in the
hemisphere and the rest of the world, while their agricultural
trade surpluses with the United States have continued to grow,''
Ballenger says.
   In the late 1960s, when total U.S. agricultural trade with the
Western Hemisphere was less than $2.1 billion a year, exports made
up almost $1.2 billion of the total. As the total U.S. trade value
rose, the export share kept pace.
   By the early 1980s, when yearly U.S. agricultural trade in the
hemisphere averaged $7.95 billion, the export share was $7.38
billion. But that was the high-water mark.
   In 1985, with a total U.S. trade value of $9.53 billion, exports
made up $5.85 billion. And in 1986, the most recent year for which
figures are available, exports made up $5.19 billion of the total
U.S. hemisphere agricultural trade of $10.24 billion.
   ``Some parts of the region, such as Mexico and the Andean,
Central American and Caribbean countries, face similar economic
circumstances,'' Ballenger said. ``The demand for their
agricultural exports is growing quite slowly, while their own food
needs are increasing rapidly.''
   The United States is looking at the recently concluded trade
agreement with Canada to help stabilize trade with its northern
neighbor, and attention now is shifting to Mexico and other
countries to the south.
   Ballenger said agricultural trade between the United States and
Mexico has shown an almost opposite trend to that with Canada.
   In the early 1980s, Mexico surpassed Canada as the largest
market in the hemisphere for U.S. agricultural products. The annual
agricultural trade balance went from an average of $273.4 million
deficit for the United States in the late 1960s to an average
yearly surplus of $827.3 million in 1980-84.
   ``In 1985-86, however, the pendulum swung back,'' she said.
``The United States again ran an agricultural trade deficit with
Mexico, which reached $940 million in 1986.''
   But now the United States again has an agricultural trade
surplus with Mexico, largely because of Mexican production
shortfalls, Ballenger said.
   Meanwhile, Brazil has emerged as a major U.S. competitor. In
1965-69, the annual U.S. agricultural trade deficit with Brazil was
$399 million. By 1980-84, the average yearly deficit was $1.259
billion, she said.
   With Brazil taking on U.S. soybean shippers and Argentina moving
into world grain markets, the United States is finding rougher
going in some of its old reliable markets in the hemisphere itself,
particularly in Mexico and the Andean and Caribbean countries.
   ``The recent proliferation of accusations of unfair trading
practices that the United States has brought against Brazil and
Argentina, for example, reflects U.S. concerns regarding its role
in Western Hemisphere agricultural trade,'' Ballenger said.
   Trade liberalization under GATT, the international rule-making
group that oversees global trade practices, could lead to
potentially serious disruptions for some Latin American countries
as well as significant benefits.
   ``If freer trade were to lead to higher grain prices (as some
studies suggest), food importing countries could face difficult
adjustments, at least in the short run,'' she said. ``But some
Latin American countries could also see sharp gains in their net
export earnings as prices for key exports, particularly beef and
sugar, strengthen.''
   Ballenger said an even more important issue also must be
resolved _ the practice of many hemisphere countries of having
government marketing boards and import licensing programs that
control trade and internal prices of agricultural products.
   ``The extent to which Latin American agricultural policies would
be affected depends not only on the outcome of the (trade) talks
but also on the extent to which developing countries will be
expected to comply with new GATT rules'' she said.

   After the big weekend shopping spree on the
other side of the wall, workday mornings in East Berlin are
dizzyingly different from what they used to be.
   ``It's a craziness,'' confided Otto, a construction supervisor
who would just as soon not give his last name. ``You wait for the
cement delivery. It doesn't come. The truck driver has just gone to
West Germany. Maybe so has the foreman. Everybody loafs, sits down
on the job. East Berliners are good at that.''
   The best in the world, according to James Lyman, a visiting
London textile salesman who regards himself as ``something of an
authority on gold bricking.''
   ``There is no job incentive,'' he said. ``You work for the state
at low pay on antiquated machinery with poor materials, and there
is almost no way you can get fired. There is a big labor shortage.
The youngest and the most skilled are leaving.''
   Things are different, too, at the big Supermarket HO, the
initials of the state-owned Handel Organization.
   ``No lines today at the checkout,'' said Greta Meinischmidt,
squeezing a shriveled apple, then a scrawny Cuban banana. ``Very
small, like our eggs. Perhaps I wait for my niece to shop across
the wall.''
   There were no lines either at the meat counter, where Frau
Meinischmidt passed up the single tray of yellowish pork cutlets
that less than a month ago would have tempted factory workers to
call in sick to join the queue.
   ``In the last month everything you heard about East Berlin has
become obsolete,'' cautioned a Yugoslav journalist colleague from
the Cambodian days now covering the East German capital. ``Now
because travel is permitted there are long lines to change money,
you wait an hour for a taxi at the bahnhof, and there is gridlock
around the police stations where passports and exit visas are
issued. I never saw so many DDR plates. People are coming in from
all the country and parking where they like. The police just
smile.''
   The ``government smile order,'' as my driver Karl called it, has
dramatically quickened the bureaucratic pace at Checkpoint Charlie.
On Tuesday it had taken nearly two hours to cross to the East as
border guards meticulously searched every trunk and glove
compartment. Now they just checked the passports and waved us
through with a smile and a salute.
   A convoy of six army trucks rumbled down Unter den Linden from
the direction of the Brandenburg Gate, and a baby-faced soldier
leaned out from under the green canvas roof to wave at a pretty
fraulein in a black leather mini skirt. She ignored him, but a
schoolboy waved back.
   ``Border guards,'' said Walter, the young waiter in the Grand
Hotel's glassed-in coffee shop. ``They're under a lot less tension
now. They can be friendly.''
   He told the latest wall joke: ``The guard dogs are being
retrained as drug-sniffing dogs.''
   West Berlin already has a severe drug problem and is regarded as
one of the most lucrative markets for crack dealers. Like street
crime, cocaine is rare on the other side of the wall. But
alcoholism is a national problem.
   Beer and vodka, available for less than two marks (about $1.10)
a shot, are the opium of the masses. As in Belfast, Northern
Ireland, you see men and sometimes women staggering around before
11 a.m.
   ``We live in a poorer, shabbier Berlin,'' conceded a barber with
the name Rolf over his comb pocket. ``That is why we come back
through those holes in the wall. Life is cheaper, food is simpler
and rents are subsidized.''
   A blue collar worker in East Berlin, putting in a 43}-hour week,
gets a monthly wage of 1,000 marks ($540). His counterpart a few
blocks to the west makes that much in a 35-hour week. But Ernst
East pays only 34 marks a month for a two-bedroom flat while Willie
West is lucky to find a one-room studio for 1,000 marks a month.
   ``Jah, that's zoe,'' chimed in the elderly customer in the
chair, ``but our buildings are all falling apart because the low
rent can't cover ordinary depreciation. And those new apartment
houses are very poorly constructed.''
   Both blamed shoddy workmanship on ``the slaves,'' as East
Berliners call the thousands of Vietnamese, Cuban and Mozambique
gastarbiters, imported workers, living in barracks and doing
low-paid, unskilled jobs at the many construction sites around town.
   In addition to the huge housing blocks rising not far from the
Wall, the government seems intent on restoring Berlin's pre-war
glory, rebuilding bombed-out palaces, churches and the old town
that flourished in the era of Prussian kings and even some of
office buildings designed by Albert Speer, Hitler's architect.
   It takes an East Berliner more than dacade to save 10,000 marks
for one of those tiny East German cars, almost as long as it takes
for delivery, but automobile exhaust pollution is already a public
health problem.

<HEAD>EAST BERLIN: health problem.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``So is pubic health itself,'' added Karl, as he drove past the
huge Charite hospital where he was born. ``Every day more and more
doctors and nurses are leaving. How can the state survive?''
   Life is far from being a cabaret, but the swinging nightclub
district off Friedrichstrasse that Christopher Isherwood's Sally
Bowles made famous is coming alive again with movie houses and
theaters crowding the somber East bloc embassies.
   ``Like haircuts, opera and theater are two-thirds cheaper over
here,'' Rudi pointed out. ``We get world famous artists, and
sometimes we see films like `E.T.' and `Out of Africa' ahead of
West Berlin.''
   That morning the box office had opened at Bertolt Brecht's
restored Deutsche Theater for a new production of Brendan Behan's
``Die Geisel'' (The Hostage).
   And there are cabarets, my Yugoslav comrade advised, in the
``five-star hotels for foreign guests paying in hard currency. Here
there are no street walkers like you see on the Kurfurstendamm, but
call girls work the big hotels. Oddly, the price is the same: 190
marks, West German only, bitte.''
   There is one mildy smutty magazine but staid East Berlin has
nothing to compete with the sex shops or strip joints that drew
long lines of wall crossers over the weekend in West Berlin. So the
question now looms: How do you keep 'em passionate for factory
production quotas after they've seen ``Erotes Berlin _ Super Sexy
Video and Sauna Parlor''?
   ``They give us football and circuses,'' laughed Walter the
waiter who has no fondness for the police, but is a passionate fan
of the Dynamos, the highly rated East Berlin police soccer team,
which is called a football team here, and can't wait for Circus
Busch to come back to town with ``those dancing Russian bears.''
   East Berlin's Christmas fair, now rising near Alexanderplatz
with amusement rides, clowns and games for the kids, will draw
thousands from the other side of the wall. But there already is a
parade of toys from that direction.
   ``East German toys are really quite charming,'' said a U.S. Army
sergeant who has been in West Berlin for six years. ``Hand crafted
things like music boxes and nutcrackers, but now that the wall is
open, the electronic stuff labeled `batteries not included' are all
the rage over here.''
   American, French and British forces stationed in West Berlin
frequently visit the East. A favorable currency exchange rate of
10-to-1 enables them to eat gourmet meals, with caviar and imported
champagne, for less than $5.
   Cigarettes are cheaper east of the Spee River, but ``terrible,''
everyone agrees, except for Cuban cigars. Despite the popularity of
coffee shops, coffee is either unavailable or ersatz.
   Records and cassettes are cheaper on this side, and books are a
bargain, although the selection is limited. Marx and Engels are
always available, but Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``Perestroika'' was
gone in a few hours.
   ``Here a best seller is how fast, not how many,'' explained
Ludwig, a student from East Berlin's Humboldt University, waiting
in line at the checkout counter of the downtown Volksbuch store.
   ``They only print so many, regardless of how well it sells.''
   Ludwig, who was wearing a Los Angeles Raiders jacket, said he
was majoring in computer sciences but now hoped to study in West
Berlin because he had been told that East Berlin's large
electronics industry ``is already two generations behind the
West.'' Before the wall went up in 1961, some 5,000 East Berliners
crossed to the Free Berlin University.
   He and some of his friends agreed that one of the most startling
changes in the past week has taken place on ``Aktuele Kamera,'' the
nightly news on East German TV.
   Once rated the most boring program in Europe, with its endless
array of apparatchiks reciting party gains and goals, it suddenly
has become what Ludwig calls ``a fun show.''
   ``Every night there is another expose of corruption. Some party
bigwig getting special privileges for his family or extra
advantages. It's intriguing,'' he said.
   Something intriguing definitely is taking place on an almost
daily basis in East Berlin. No wonder the British Cultural Center
on Unter den Linden has Graham Greene featured in large window
displays. You almost expect Harry Lime to jump out of a sewer and
do a TV interview with Dan Rather at the Brandenburg Gate against a
background of zithers playing ``The Third Man Theme.''

   Here you are in the age of AIDS, preparing
for surgery that may require a transfusion. Is the blood available
from the local blood bank safe? Should you have some of your own
set aside?
   Yes, and yes, doctors say.
   What if you just want some of your blood on hand in case you're
hit by a truck or need an emergency operation _ is that worthwhile?
   Probably not, say the American Red Cross and tradtional blood
banks.
   Yes, say those who freeze and store blood for a fee.
   ``A blood transfusion is the most intimate contact you can have
with another human being. It is more intimate than sex,'' said Dr.
Joseph Feldschuh of New York, who founded an independent frozen
blood lab in 1985. The Food and Drug Administration says 18 such
companies are licensed in the United States.
   Freezing blood for long-term storage is nothing new. The Red
Cross has been doing it without charge since 1964 for people with
rare blood, and has 10,000 pints in frozen storage at 56 centers.
Non-donors may use it in emergencies.
   Companies began getting into freezing four or five years ago
because of AIDS anxiety but ``there has been a low level of such
activity,'' said Dr. Toby Simon, president of the American
Association of Blood Banks.
   The Pentagon kicked off the world's largest frozen blood program
in October, a five-year project to draw 45,000 pints a year toward
stockpiling 225,000 pints domestically and abroad for use during
combat or disasters.
   Medical authorities, including the American Medical Association,
agree that whether the concern is disease or simply the best match,
the safest blood you can receive is your own. But freezing blood on
speculation is another matter.
   Liquid blood has a shelf life of 42 days, while frozen blood can
be kept 20 years or more. But dealing with frozen blood, which must
be thawed and cleaned of chemicals added during freezing, is
expensive and there is no guarantee it will be available where and
when it is needed, Simon said.
   Most U.S. transfusions are for surgery and there is generally
time for a patient to have blood drawn a few weeks beforehand, he
said.
   In an emergency, the chance of contracting disease through a
transfusion pales beside the risk of dying without it, said Dr.
Arthur Kellermann, director of emergency services at the Regional
Medical Center at Memphis and a professor of emergency medicine at
the University of Tennessee, Memphis.
   But James W. Jarvis, who runs a Miami-based blood storage
company, said setting aside a permanent supply ``can provide a
layer of protection for your family and yourself that is not
otherwise there.'' His Personal Blood Storage of America Inc.
recently opened an office near the Federal Express air shipment hub
in Memphis, guaranteeing delivery anywhere in the country in six
hours.
   Six hours can be too long in an emergency, Kellerman said. ``We
literally may need to give a patient blood within five or 10
minutes of coming in the door.'' Emergency rooms often lack time
even to cross-match a patient's blood and must simply give type-O,
the so-called universal donor, he said.
   The Red Cross and military frozen blood programs have nothing to
do with fear of disease, said Dr. Gerald Sandler, the Red Cross'
medical director. The risk of getting AIDS through a transfusion is
about one in 100,000 _ ``better than the odds of getting through
your operation,'' he said.
   A greater statistical risk is hepatitis, with the chances of
infection at two to four in 100 per pint of blood. A new screening
test to be used starting next year is expected to reduce that to
one in a hundred or less.
   Those risks are enough, Feldschuh said, for concern. His Idant
Laboratories will store a pint of blood for $12.50 a month, plus
$85 in drawing and testing fees and about $45 for processing when
it's time to use the blood.
   At Personal Blood Storage, it costs $295 to store a pint for
four years, and $4 a month after that. Additional charges totaling
$125 are likely when the blood is used, plus any shipping, said
spokeswoman Laura Hardy.
   On average, a person getting a transfusion gets four pints, says
the Red Cross, which collects half of the 12 million pints of blood
drawn annually in the United States. It puts the average cost of a
pint of blood at $52. Hospital fees may add $50 to that, said Bob
Rigney of the blood bank association.
   Most medical insurance does not pay for storing blood on
speculation but generally covers all costs when it's time to use
the blood, said Jarvis, whose company has freezers in Florida and
South Carolina as well as Memphis.
   He wouldn't say how many customers he has or how much blood is
in the freezers. Idant, a subsidiary of Daxor Corp., which runs
what it bills as the world's largest frozen sperm bank, also
wouldn't release those figures.
   ``It's not a business where anybody is going to make money for
quite a while. ... I feel this is the wave of the future,''
Feldschuh said.
   The issue of frozen storage aside, the Red Cross and American
Association of Blood Banks are trying to convince people to set
aside their own blood prior to surgery, for what is called
autologous transfusions. Besides being safer for the patients,
autologous donations reduce the demand on blood banks.
   ``There was a dramatic increase for several years for autologous
donations but it's kind of leveled off,'' Simon said. ``We're not
certain whether it's being optimally utilized everywhere or not.''
   In 1987, member hospitals, blood banks and doctors drew 283,000
autologous pints, ``a 55 percent increase over 1986 figures, and
1986 was a 50 percent jump over 1985,'' said spokesman Rigney. He
did not have later figures.
   The Red Cross last year drew 116,400 autologous pints, compared
with 5,500 in 1985, and hospitals with active surgical departments
have enouraged it.
   For autologous blood drawn prior to surgery, it is reasonable,
Sandler said, for many patients to give blood two or three times a
week in building up a stock of five or six pints. Two years ago, he
said, the Red Cross checked on 3,000 people who had their own blood
in frozen storage because of rare types, and found that 20 of them
had actually needed transfusions.
   ``Of the 20 out of the 3,000, every one of them could have done
it in a much, much less expensive way of waiting to have blood
drawn until they knew they needed surgery,'' said Sandler, who
worries that companies' sales pitches will weaken public confidence
in traditional blood banks. ``You can't market to the public the
concept of freezing your own blood without marketing fear of the
blood that most people in the community have to use.''
   ``We are not playing on anybody's fears,'' Jarvis said. ``We are
taking the entrepreneurial spirit that has built this country and
applying it to science and medicine.''

<HEAD>Doctors: Crack Epidemic Spurring Increase in Congenital Syphilis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MORAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crack cocaine use has been linked to an
increase in syphilis that could blossom to epidemic proportions
like AIDS has, say medical researchers calling for more agressive
education and treatment efforts.
   Pediatric syphilis jumped 128 percent from 329 cases in 1985 to
751 last year as the number of new infections overall climbed 48
percent, from 27,131 to 40,117, according to the national Centers
for Disease Control.
   ``Even without AIDS, congenital syphilis has devastating effects
on children. For every case of a child born with the disease, there
are two or three cases of stillborns and spontaneous miscarriages
that should be included in statistics,'' said Dr. H. Hunter
Handsfield, director of the Seattle-King County division of
sexually transmitted diseases.
   The increase coincides with the emergence of both AIDS and crack.
   ``The same behavior that places someone at risk for AIDS also
places them at risk for syphilis,'' said Peggy Clarke, formerly
assistant commissioner of the New York City AIDS program, now
executive director of the American Social Health Association in
Durham, N.C., a prevention advocacy group. ``People in sexual
relationships with drug users are at risk for syphilis and HIV.''
   ``So far both illicit drug use, primarily crack, and
prostitution have been found to be risk factors for syphilis, and
people using crack have been more likely to be infected,'' said Dr.
Ken Gershman of the CDC staff.
   The link between crack, prostitution and syphilis was documented
in studies in Connecticut and Philadelphia. Public health workers
who interviewed infected patients found crack use and prostitution
widespread among them. Syphilis rates rose 70 percent from
1984-1987 in Connecticut, and 74 percent in Philadelphia.
   ``The emergence of syphilis among prostitutes, drug users and
their sexual contacts may be a widespread national phenomenon,''
the CDC concluded.
   Although syphilis is not yet an epidemic, specialists point to
AIDS as an example of what a disease can do within a decade. Almost
unknown before 1981, it has infected more than 100,000 Americans
since then, killing nearly 65,000.
   After nearly two decades of steadily declining syphilis rates,
new infections, known as primary syphilis, began rising again in
1985, about the same year law enforcement officials first
encountered crack.
   The upswing is confined almost exclusively to black, inner city
neighborhoods, according to the CDC. In fact, the overall infection
rate among whites has continued to decrease during the 1980s,
Gershman said.
   The sexually transmitted disease first identified in the 1400s
is difficult to detect; it is characterized by a genital chancre,
or sore, which disappears sometimes for years. It is rarely fatal
in adults if identified and treated. In children and particularly
newborns, congenital syphilis often causes severe brain damage,
blindness, deafness or even death if undetected.
   ``In some cases, we never know how severely the child is
affected,'' said Handsfield. ``A child's IQ level could be 90
instead of 110. Or it could stunt growth. In other cases, the child
can remain in a deep, irreversible coma.''
   The combination of AIDS and syphilis has made detection and
treatment of each more difficult. ``Each disease affects the other
and the HIV virus makes it harder to diagnose and treat syphilis,''
Handsfield said.
   Although evidence exists that children are being born with both
AIDS and syphilis, statistics for concurrent cases are not
available, Gershman said.
   Confirming infection in newborns is especially difficult because
detection of syphilis, as with the HIV virus that causes AIDS,
depends on identifying the antibodies produced to fight the disease
instead of the disease itself. A baby testing positive for syphilis
antibodies may not develop the disease.
   The dilemma for pediatricians, Handsfield said, is: ``Do you
treat the baby with a massive penicillin dose knowing 10 percent of
cases are not infected, or do you take a cautious approach and use
a mild dose waiting for more tests?''
   In practice, they choose the aggressive approach, he said. The
danger from a large penicillin dose is relatively minor, and
``these mothers, some of them are drug addicts, prostitutes, have a
very good chance of not showing up again after they give birth. You
say to yourself, as long as I've got the baby, I may as well put
him in the hospital for 10 days and not worry about whether the
mother comes back.''

   Growth of business inventories outpaced
business sales in September, the government said in a report
analysts said contained a warning of growing backlogs due to the

   Sun Microsystems Inc. and Unisys Corp. have
confirmed they have decided not to join U.S. Memories Inc., a
chip-making consortium that is getting off the ground slowly.
   U.S. Memories was announced in June as a project to restore
American strength in production of the common computer memory chips
known as dynamic random access memory chips, or DRAMs. But efforts
to recruit investors have had mixed success.
   Apple Computer Inc. and Tandy Corp. earlier said they would not
join as investors. The consortium confirmed it received a letter
Wednesday from Sun Microsystems, a computer workstation maker,
saying it had decided not to join because it had adequate supplies
of DRAMs lined up from other supppliers.
   Sanford Kane, the U.S. Memories president, said Sun's decision
was a disappointment but not a major blow.
   ``Sun is only one of 18 companies considering investing in U.S.
Memories _ more than enough to make U.S. Memories happen,'' Kane
said in a statement from the consortium's temporary headquarters in
New City, N.Y.
   Unisys told reporters Wednesday that it also had decided not to
join. But Joanne Howard, a spokeswoman for U.S. Memories, said the
company had never expressed interest in joining anyway.
   The seven founding members of the consortium are International
Business Machines Corp., Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co., Intel Corp., Advanced Micro Devices Inc., LSI Logic Corp. and
National Semiconductor Corp.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock market reform legislation pending before
Congress doesn't outlaw program trading, but that's all right with
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden.
   ``I don't think it gives us the authority to ban program trading
per se,'' Breeden said of the Securities Markets Stabilization Act
of 1989. Rather, he said, it allows the SEC to single out
``specific harmful practices, including those associated with
program trading.''
   Breeden said Wednesday he supports the recently amended bill now
before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. It would allow the
SEC to curtail trading practices found to be ``manipulative or
abusive.''
   Critics of program trading, in which enormous blocks of stocks
are bought or sold in a wink of an eye via computer programs, say
it can lead to volatility _ sharp price rises and drops _ which in
turn, scares small investors out of the market.
   And that, say the critics, makes it hard for U.S. companies to
sell securities and raise capital.
   If the bill is passed, said Breeden, the SEC could then ``define
rules that would bar specific practices that we deem to be harmful
and contributing to excessive volatility, and those practices could
include program trading.''
   The bill must be passed by the Energy and Commerce Committee
before going to the House floor. Congressional leaders have said
they want to adjourn for the holidays next week.
   A similar bill that does not deal with program trading is
pending before the Senate Banking Committee.
   Breeden told a group of reporters at SEC headquarters that the
controversial, computer-driven trading strategy is only a symptom
of bigger market problems.
   ``I think we need a close look at the whole issue of volatility
and the factors that help produce it and the elements that may be
at work. I'd like to make sure that before we treat only the
symptom that we also are aware of what the disease is,'' he said.
   Originally the house bill would have allowed the SEC to
intervene when it considered trading practices to be
``disruptive,'' but members of the telecommunications and finance
subcomitee argued that the word was too vague.
   Breeden said he thought the debate over program trading had
caused discussion to stray from ``the big issues of this bill,''
two provisions that would require large traders to report their
transactions and require the SEC to assess the financial stability
of the parent and affilated companies of brokerage houses.
   ``The rest of the bill is very important,'' said Breeden. ``It
would improve our ability to improve stability in the market.''
   He added that another provision allowing the SEC to halt all
trading in market emergencies after consulting with the president
was less important since the creation of mechanisms, known as
circuit breakers, that automatically halt trading during times of
extreme turbulence.
   ``The development of circuit breakers has obviated most of the
importance of that section,'' said Breeden, who originally opposed
giving the SEC authority on its own, to halt trading.
   ``I was concerned that completely unfettered discretionary
authority,'' said Breeden ``could prove to be destabilizing.''
   He said having such power could lead to rumors that it was about
to be invoked, causing uncertainty in the markets.
   But the new legislative language adding presidential
consultation, approved by the subcommittee Tuesday, creates a
``two-key system'' like those used to guard against accidental
missile launches.
   ``You can't launch a missile without the two keys. And this is
still a two-key system and that's what I wanted to see in place,''
said Breeden, adding that he believed that would lessen
destabilizing rumors in times of extreme volatility.
   On another matter, Breeden conceded that it was unusual for him
to comment before a congressional panel this week about an ongoing
SEC investigation into possible fraud concerning the failure of the
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association and its parent, American
Continental Corp.
   ``We generally don't like to comment on whether we have an
investigation going,'' said Breeden, but he said the probe was
previously disclosed in SEC filings by the subject of the
investigation.
   ``Given the level of congresional and public interest in this
matter and given the fact the investigation's existence had been
disclosed by the subject of the investigation, I didn't think that
there was any undue harm to confirm the fact,'' said Breeden.

   The nation's stock exchanges don't have to be
earthquake-proof _ or even fireproof _ but the Securities and
Exchange Commission wants them to figure out what they would do if
one hit.
   The five-member commission voted unanimously Wednesday to
approve a policy statement calling on self-regulatory organizations
in the securities industry to review their computer systems
periodically.
   The SEC wants the industry to assess their systems' capacity to
handle heavy volumes of trades and their vulnerability to natural
catastrophes and human tampering.
   ``It is our belief that by providing guidance in this area we
can continue and encourage efforts in the self-regulatory
organizations to increase the efficiency of our systems and reduce
the risk that the systems themselves will be unable to operate in
times of stress,'' Richard G. Ketchum, director of the SEC's
Division of Market Regulation, told the commissioners.
   The new policy, which is purely voluntary, also will request
that exchanges and the National Association of Securities Dealers,
which oversees the over-the-counter market of stocks that are not
traded on exchanges, conduct ``stress tests'' of their automated
systems to see how they would stand up to extremes in trading
volume.
   Another aim of the policy is to get exchanges to establish
contingency plans and develop backup facilities in the event of a
system failure.
   The new policy is a response to the October 1987 market crash,
when the trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange hit 1.2
billion shares over two days.
   That record surge caused backups in some automated systems,
leading to delays in executing trades and transmitting transaction
reports.
   Automated systems were taxed again by last month's 190-point
drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   ``Wall Street can't work without computers,'' said Commissioner
Joseph A. Grundfest.
   The new policy also calls for the self-regulatory organizations
to assess the vulnerability of automated systems to threat such as
fires, earthquakes and vandalism.
   Options traders at San Francisco's Pacific Stock Exchange had to
be flown to other cities to resume trading after last month's
earthquake.
   Just last week, a fire in lower Manhattan in the building
housing the New York Stock and American stock exchanges' computers
forced an hour-long delay in the opening of the two trading floors.
   The SEC policy statement also requests exchanges to notify the
commission promptly of any instances of unauthorized access to
their computer systems.
   Kathryn V. Natale, an assistant director of the SEC's Market
Regulation division, said there have been no instances ``to date''
of unauthorized access but she said there is ``a greater threat as
we internationalize'' the markets.

   New U.S. barriers to foreign investment would
betray the trust of Eastern Europeans who are now opening a vast
new market to the West, former Attorney General Elliot L.
Richardson told Congress.
   He noted that Lech Walesa, the Polish labor leader, has been
urging U.S. investment in Poland.
   ``America has historically been the champion of both economic
and political liberalization,'' Richardson told a House banking
subcommittee Wednesday.
   ``Mr. Walesa's appearance in Washington is surely a sign that
America continues to be seen as a champion. The erection of
protectionist barriers would be a signal to Eastern Europe that we
are not putting our money where our mouth is,'' Richardson said.
   ``It would be a betrayal of our principles and their trust,'' he
said.
   Richardson heads the Association for International Investment, a
private group that promotes greater flows of capital across
borders. He opposed any change in current U.S. policy.
   His views were challenged by two witnesses who warned against
foreign political penetration of the United States through
investment.
   ``Political Action Commitees (PACs) of foreign affiliates here
... contributed more than $2 million during the 1988 election
cycles,'' said Pat Choate, vice president of policy analysis for
TRW Inc., a major consulting firm.
   ``The raw political power of foreign owners to shape U.S. trade
policies is a troubling new development in the American political
scene that is unexplored,'' Choate said.
   Susan J. Tolchin, professor of public administration at George
Washington University, suggested stronger enforcement of laws that
prohibit foreigners from taking part in U.S. elections.
   ``The foreign automakers' PAC intervened successfullky in the
1988 congressional election, claiming victory in the defeat of
several members whose policies they felt were inimical to their
interests,'' she said.
   Both complained of what they said is inadequate data on foreign
investment in the United States.
   ``Among the many consequences of this information gap is that
the Defense Department does not know who controls the critical
industries that produce the key technologies used in America's most
advanced weapons systems,'' Choate said.
   Richardson said foreign acquisition is an emotional issue.
   ``Serious people felt a tug at their hearts when they heard of
the sale of Rockefeller Center,'' he said.
   ``But I would ask them to consider the feelings of Britons and
the response of the British government to Ford's buyout of Jaguar.
...,'' he said.
   ``The British government, far from preventing the deal, actually
removed a legal obstacle to it. I respect their wisdom and hope
that we can emulate their courage,'' Richardson said.
   The witnesses testified before the subcommittee on Economic
Stabilization of the House Banking Committee. Rep. Mary Rose Oakar,
D-Ohio, who chairs the subcommittee, said this was the first of a
series of hearings that will continue into next year to review
international investment.

<HEAD>GE in Largest Postwar Business Investment Deal in Hungary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a $150 million deal that would
represent the largest postwar business investment in Hungary by a
Western company, General Electric Co. has agreed to buy controlling
interest in Tungsram, a Budapest-based lightbulb maker.
   The deal, announced Wednesday, is made possible by the recent
liberalization of economic and political systems in Eastern Europe.
Hungary has been in the forefront of this trend, throwing out
restrictions on foreign ownership and signaling it is eager for
investment from the West.
   ``This is both an excellent global move for GE and a historic
moment in the reform of Hungary's economic system,'' said John T.
Welch, chairman of Fairfield-based General Electric. ``This joint
venture was made possible by the Hungarian government's policy of
encouraging foreign investment and looking to world markets.''
   Tungsram is one of Hungary's largest industrial companies, with
12 manufacturing plants. Annual sales amount to about $300 million
and 85 percent of its products are marketed abroad.
   Under the terms of a joint venture agreement negotiated with the
Hungarian Credit Bank, GE's Cleveland-based General Electric
Lighting unit will purchase just over 50 percent of Tungsram and
will assume management of the venture.
   The majority of these shares are owned by the Austrian
Girocentrale bank, GE said.
   In addition, General Electric has the option to purchase up to
20 percent more of the shares on condition it accepts the
obligation of doubling the partnership's West European sales within
a five-year period.
   Andras Gabor, president of Tungsram, said Hungary was on its way
to becoming a democracy and developing a free enterprise system,
and that there was no going back.
   ``GE's participation in Tungsram gives us the opportunity both
to grow our lighting business and to embrace this process of
change,'' Gabor said, according to a GE statement.
   The two partners plan to combine their European lighting
distribution organizations into one unit to market both General
Electric and Tungsram products, GE said.
   The joint venture will manufacture and sell products ranging
from household lamps and energy-saving fluorescent products and
high-technology discharge lamps.
   In addition, it will manufacture a full range of vehicle lamps
and a number of special lamps, ranging from miniature halogen lamps
to infrared quartz lamps. GE Lighting said it will assist Tungsram
in expanding its product lines.
   GE also will invest technological resources in the joint
venture, modernize Tungsram's plant and equipment and introduce
Western management techniques.
   GE will provide training for Tungsram management and workers
both in Hungary and the United States.
   The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of this
year, GE said, following negotiation of definitive agreements and
government reviews.
   ``The combination of Tungsram's extensive product line and
manufacturing base with GE's advanced technology and manufacturing
expertise will give us a better competitive position in the
worldwide lighting market,'' said John D. Opie, a senior vice
president of GE Lighting.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local governments should have the power to
regulate basic cable television fees in certain cases, says a
bipartisan group of senators who have proposed controls on the
cable TV industry.
   Sen. John Danforth of Missouri, the senior Republican on the
Commerce Committee, which handles communications issues, said
Wednesday the legislation was ``to place some check on what is now
an unregulated monopoly.''
   The bill's sponsors, seven Democrats and seven Republicans, said
the legislation was to address complaints about rising cable
television rates in the wake of deregulation and a lack of local
government control over services provided to the more than 50
million cable TV subscribers nationwide.
   The legislation is strongly opposed by the industry.
   ``This bill offers a series of extreme solutions to problems
that are either modest or non-existent,'' James P. Mooney,
president of the National Cable Television Association, said in a
statement.
   As introduced, the bill would:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Empower cities and other local governments to regulate rates
for basic cable TV service in areas where there is no competition
from another cable provider.
   _Make it easier for local governments to revoke a cable
operator's franchise or deny a renewal.
   _Prohibit any individual cable operator from serving more than
15 percent of the nation's subscribers.
   _Require cable companies to carry local TV station signals from
their area, known in the industry as a ``must carry'' rule, and
give local broadcasters some guarantees on their channel placement
by the cable operator. In general, the bill would require cable
systems to carry local stations on the same channel as their
over-the-air position or at the channel location they had on the
cable-TV system as of 1985.
   A 1984 law largely deregulated the cable industry, with rate
deregulation taking effect in 1987.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Proposes Federal Product Liability Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. product liability law should be revised,
and include the creation of a federal product liability statute
that would result in lower insurance costs and help make U.S.
companies more competitive abroad, the U.S. Commerce Department
says.
   ``The existing product liability system is in no one's
interest,'' said Wendell Willkie II, general counsel for the
Commerce Department. ``It imposes unwarranted costs and creates
uncertainty for American companies, reducing their profitability
and limiting their ability to compete effectively ...''
   Willkie, in a speech at an insurance industry seminar Wednesday
in Manhattan, gave the first public statement of the Bush
administration's plans to seek an overhaul of product liability
laws.
   During the 1988 presidential campaign, George Bush said he would
support federal limits on certain types of product liability
lawsuits to cut business insurance costs.
   Bush has told the Council on Competitiveness, a panel headed by
Vice President Dan Quayle, to propose changes in product liability
laws that eventually could be submitted to Congress, Willkie said.
   The council, which includes officials of the Commerce, Justice,
and Treasury departments, was expected to make its recommendations
early next year.
   ``The Bush administration believes the time for federal product
liability legislation has arrived,'' Willkie said in his speech.
   Willkie, who is working on the proposed changes, declined to
discuss any details. But he said the president has three main
objectives in seeking a federal product liability statute:
   _The restoration of fault as the standard under which an
individual can receive damages in a product liability case. Under
many state laws, a manufacturer can be held liable even if a
consumer's actions were the cause of an injury and the product was
not defective.
   _The elimination of ``deep pocket'' liability, in which a
defendant with the most money can be forced to pay an entire award
even though it was only partly responsible.
   _Increased use of alternative means of settling claims, such as
arbitration and mediation, to help lower the costs of product
liability litigation.
   Under Congress' constitutional power to regulate interstate
commerce, a federal product liability law would take precedence
over conflicting state laws.
   Many state laws would remain in effect, but a law passed by
Congress would ``establish federal principles that would be
incorporated'' into the current state laws, Willkie said in a
telephone interview after his speech.
   The states still would have jurisdiction over product liability
cases, but would be bound by federal law, he said.
   In his speech, Willkie said the rising costs of insurance
coverage and litigation in product liability cases have eroded
manufacturers' profits. The higher costs have also driven up the
cost of the goods American consumers buy, making foreign products
more attractive.
   Some U.S. companies also have decided against expanding or
creating new products out of fear they might one day face product
liability claims, he said, citing a decision by Monsanto Corp. not
to develop a substitute for asbestos because of potential suits.
   ``It feared the possibility of substantial future liability
should the product be blamed for harm that cannot currently be
identified,'' Willkie said.
   Meanwhile, ``product liability insurance costs are 15 times
higher in the U.S. than in Japan, and product liability insurances
rates were reported in the early 1980s as averaging 20 times higher
in the U.S. than in Europe,'' he said.
   ``Product liability insurance costs account for up 15 percent of
the cost of certain American-made machine tools,'' Willkie said.
   Such statistics ``demonstrate that, in general, foreign product
liability laws impose a far smaller relative cost burden on
businesses than American product liability law,'' Willkie said.
   His speech came at a seminar sponsored by Johnson &amp; Higgins, a
large privately-held insurance brokerage.

<HEAD>Georgia Pacific May Up Offer for Great Northern</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. Chairman T. Marshall Hahn
Jr. said a ``friendly merger'' with Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.
could still take place despite Great Northern's opposition to the
proposal, and that the offering price could be raised.
   Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig earlier this week
rejected the company's $58-a-share offer in a letter to its
shareholders and to Hahn.
   Georgia-Pacific announced Wednesday that it had lined up
commitments for $4.5 billion from 19 domestic and international
banks to fund the takeover of the paper company. The company said
Bank of America, its primary bank since the 1950s, agreed to
provide $1.25 billion of that amount.
   Georgia-Pacific added that banks offered more than $8.4 billion
more than is needed for the takeover. Georgia-Pacific needs $3.3
billion to buy the Norwalk, Conn.-based Great Northern.
   In written answers to submitted questions, Hahn said
Georgia-Pacific's offer was ``50 percent above Great Northern's
market price''' when it was made, ``but we've made it clear that
all terms of our offer, including price, are negotiable,'' he said.
   Hahn added, ``We are disappointed with Great Northern's
misdirected response.''
   If successful, the takeover of Great Northern would be one of
the largest acquisitions ever for Georgia-Pacific, which has used
buyouts to grow over 62 years from a lumberyard to one of the
world's top forest products companies.
   Meanwhile, Georgia-Pacific announced Wednesday it has received a
request by the Federal Trade Commission for additional information
on the company's tender offer for Great Northern. Georgia-Pacific
officials said the company will begin assembling the additional
information immediately.
   Great Northern announced Tuesday it was challenging a ruling by
the Interstate Commerce Commission that cleared Georgia-Pacific to
include Great Northern's four railroads in the proposed takeover.
   Great Northern charged that Georgia-Pacific ``cut corners'' and
engaged in ``questionable tactics'' to get the ruling.

<HEAD>Cargill Fined $754,000 for Allegedly Exposing Employees to Injury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Department of Labor has fined a Missouri
turkey processing plant owned by Cargill Inc. $754,000 for
``knowingly and willfully'' exposing its employees to injury caused
by repetitive motions.
   The fine, one of the largest penalties ever imposed by the
department on a poultry processing company, is the second for
Cargill in a month. The food processor was fined $242,000 on Oct.
23 for 113 alleged violations at a plant in Buena Vista, Ga.
   Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole on Monday said the company was
aware of the safety problems at the California, Mo., plant, as it
was at the Georgia plant.
   ``The company fully recognized that employees were exposed to
hazards causing serious physical harm and took little action to
eliminate or reduce the possibility of injury,'' she said.
``Employers must protect their workers from these illnesses and
injuries.''
   The company is contesting the fines, issued after the Labor
Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration
investigated the plants.
   ``Cargill is committed to protecting the safety and health of
its employees,'' said Greg Lauser, a company spokesman.
   The department contends that workers have been exposed to
``trauma disorders'' in the hands, arms, shoulders and neck. The
injuries are caused by rapid and repetitive motion.
   At the plants, workers cut up as many as 5,000 birds a day.
   Cargill, which has its headquarters in Minneapolis, was cited
for 101 alleged violations at the Missouri plant, which employs
about 520 people.

<HEAD>Shoe Company Reveals Federal Investigation of Import Duties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   L.A. Gear Inc., the designer and marketer of
popular shoes and apparel, said it has learned it is a target of a
federal investigation of alleged underpayment of duties on imports
from Taiwan.
   The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney's
office in Massachusetts and involves several shipments of shoes
from Taiwan several years ago, the company said Wednesday in a
statement.
   The company referred queries for details of the investigation to
its New York attorney, John Quinn.
   ``We decline to comment other than to say we're cooperating with
the investigation. We've produced the documents requested,'' Quinn
said.
   L.A. Gear's statement said the shipments were made through an
independent agent before the company opened its own office in
Taiwan.
   ``The company believes it has fully complied with its
obligations to pay customs duties. The company's counsel has
conducted an internal investigation and, based on advice of
counsel, company management believes it has meritorious defenses to
any foreseeable charges or claims,'' L.A. Gear said.
   The statement said the federal investigation could lead to an
indictment, a civil case for underpayment of duties or no action at
all.
   If the company is indicted and prosecuted, legal opinions hold
that ``the company's maximum exposure would not have a materially
adverse effect on the company's financial statements or its
continuing operations,'' L.A. Gear said.
   Founded as a retail store in Los Angeles in 1983, L.A. Gear now
markets athletic and athletic-style shoes, apparel and accessories
in more than 90 countries. It describes itself as the third-largest
athletic footwear company in the United States.
   Sales in 1983 totaled $4.5 million. Since then, annual sales
have grown rapidly, reaching $235.6 million in the first six months
of 1989.
   Pop music superstar Michael Jackson recently announced an
agreement with L.A. Gear to design and market a signature line of
fashion sneakers.

   Share prices were firmer in directionless trading
at midday Thursday as the market evaluated the slew of corporate
earnings reports and British economic data released earlier in the
session, traders said.
   The market began on sound footing, largely on Wednesday's
healthy performance on Wall Street and relief after Wednesday's
economic statement by Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major which
contained no nasty surprises for the market.
   But most of the morning was spent measuring the outcome of many
interim and final earnings from major British companies as well as
some vital indicators, traders said.
   ``We're just waiting for all the numbers to roll in,'' said one
senior dealer at a major European brokerage.
   At 12:05 p.m. London time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 9.5 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,212.9, just
off its starting intraday peak of 2,213.8 and better than the
midmorning minimum of 2,200.9.
   Volume amounted to a moderate 271.8 million shares by midday,
compared with 186.8 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

<HEAD>EDS: Lead not planned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The federal government loans or insures
$20,000 for every man, woman and child in the country _ a total of
$5 trillion _ congressional auditors say in reporting a 10-fold
expansion of such programs in the past 13 years.
   ``While the government will undoubtedly not be required to
provide financial assistance for its total exposure associated with
these programs, its continuing and growing exposure to losses
cannot be ignored,'' the General Accounting Office says.
   Nonetheless, the congressional watchdog agency said in a report
prepared for a hearing today before a House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee, it ``is apparent that federal financial assistance
beyond that already provided will be needed to pay for growing
losses.''
   Future taxpayers already have been tapped through a farm credit
rescue and two savings and loan bailouts in the past three years to
absorb tens of billions of dollars in federal loan and insurance
losses.
   Additional billions of dollars in losses _ many of them not even
discovered yet _ exist in other government credit and insurance
programs, the GAO said.
   ``Not every program is in trouble,'' said Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., who requested the study as the subcommittee's chairman.
``But some are in a serious enough state to be cause for concern.''
   Dingell said the potential liabilities make the $14 billion to
$16 billion in fiscal 1990 budget cuts being sought by Congress
``look like pocket change.''
   ``In effect, every single American has co-signed a note for
$20,000,'' he said.
   From 1985 to 1988 losses on direct loans written off by the
government increased 1,700 percent _ from $1.2 billion to $21.2
billion _ and delinquent loans rose by 33 percent, from $14.6
billion to $19.5 billion last year.
   An even bigger potential for losses exists in the loan guarantee
programs that deficit-conscious Congresses and presidents found
attractive this decade for keeping the potential liabilities off
the government's balance sheet, the GAO said.
   ``Many newer guarantee programs such as those for education and
energy conservation involve loans with little or no marketable
property as security,'' the auditors said.
   Others, such as those for small businesses that cannot otherwise
get credit in the private market, can quickly turn sour upon
industry downturns and other changes in the economy, they added.
   As an example, the GAO cited the Department of Education's
student loan guarantee program, which has grown from $26.5 billion
in 1983 to $47.6 billion last year. Reported defaults on student
loans have almost tripled during the same time, from $486 million
in 1983 to $1.4 billion in 1988.
   Altogether, a wide variety of loan guarantee programs have
increased by 51 percent over the past five years to $550 billion.
Annual defaults on those federally guaranteed loans have jumped by
138 percent, from $4.7 billion in 1983 to $11.2 billion last year,
the GAO said.
   The real situation could be even worse, the agency said. Just
two months ago GAO auditors found $4.2 billion in Federal Housing
Administration loan defaults in 1988 _ five times what the agency
reported.
   ``The full magnitude of the government's losses under its credit
assistance and insurance programs is not known,'' the GAO said.
``Because of long-standing deficiencies in financial managements
and inconsistencies in the application of accounting principles by
federal agencies, losses are not always being recorded or reported
when they occur.''
   In addition to the $550 billion in loan guarantees and another
$222 billion in outstanding direct loans, the government also is
liable for $3.6 trillion in insurance commitments, most of it
covering deposits in banks, S&amp;Ls and credit unions.
   Loans by government-sponsored enterprises, such as the Federal
National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., Freddie Mac, total $656 billion, up from $15
billion in 1965.

<HEAD>Heileman Chief Says Loan Waiver Gives Brewer to June to Reorganize</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The G. Heileman Brewing Co. has reached
agreements with creditors that will give it until next June to
rebound from a declining market share and sales, the company said.
   Heileman was given a waiver on its loans from U.S. and Canadian
banks, company President Murray Cutbush said Wednesday. The
agreements will allow the brewer to realize benefits from spending
on capital improvements and marketing in 1989, he said.
   In an interview published Wednesday in The Milwaukee Journal,
Cutbush responded to a report in Australia that Heileman may not be
able to continue as a going concern.
   An auditor for Heileman's owner, Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. of
Australia, said in Bond's annual report that cash flow from
Heileman's operations was not projected to be enough to make
principal payments on Heileman's long-term debt in fiscal 1990.
   ``These factors raise substantial doubt about (Heileman's)
ability to continue as a going concern,'' the report said.
   Cutbush said that while the company's 1989 performance was less
than satisfactory, price increases and marketing and capital
expenditures during the year were made for the long term, not just
for one year.
   Heileman could have spent nothing during 1989 and ended the year
with a better record, he said, ``but that was not the view we
took.''
   Heileman spent money on capital improvements and new advertising
and marketing efforts, including the development of new
commercials, all of which ultimately will benefit the brewing
operation, said Cutbush.
   The expenditures were painful, he said, but ``done with the
long-term future of Heileman in mind.''
   In addition, Heileman closed three breweries, including a large
one in Perry, Ga., and those moves will reduce significantly the
brewery's overhead, Cutbush said. The other two breweries closed
are in Evansville, Ind., and Belleville, Ill.
   ``We will realize those benefits in the following years,'' he
said.
   Since May, Heileman has been trading profitably, in part because
of price increases for its premium beers for the first time in
years, Cutbush said.
   ``We have seen a significant benefit from the large expenditure
for marketing,'' he said.
   Bond bought Heileman in 1987, just weeks before the stock market
crashed, for about $1.3 billion, and reportedly still owes about
$850 million after selling the profitable Heileman Baking Co. and
other Heileman subsidiaries.
   Analysts have said Bond paid too much for Heileman and cannot
service the debt with Heileman earnings.
   The audit of Bond Corp., which is controlled by Australian
financier Alan Bond, was done in Perth, Australia, by Terry
Underwood, a partner in investment firm Arthur Andersen &amp; Co.
   The audit also cast doubt on the value of some of the Australian
concerns assets, including real estate and media properties around
the world.
   Last month, Bond reported losses of $773.9 million in the fiscal
year ending in June, and the auditors report said those losses are
continuing.
   Underwood said the Bond groups liabilities exceeded assets by
$1.36 billion in Australian dollars.

   The New York Times will sponsor a one-year,

at Columbia University.
   The program will be open to working reporters or editors at any
U.S. newspaper or magazine, The New York Times Company said in a

   The $25,000 fellowship will cover the costs of tuition and
university housing. The journalist's employer will be asked to

said.
   The program's first fellow will be selected in the spring of

   The grant for mid-career print journalists was created to

<HEAD>Chairman of Kansas City Southern Dies At Age 73</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   William N. Deramus III, chairman of
Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and once the youngest man to
head a railroad company has died. He was 73.
   Deramus, who took over as head of Kansas City Southern in 1961,
died Wednesday at Truman Medical Center after being rushed there
from his office in downtown Kansas City.
   ``He was one of our finest,'' said Donald J. Hall, chairman of
Hallmark Cards Inc. Hall said he worked with Deramus on civic
activities thoughout the years. ``He was a very generous soul and
an important Kansas Citian.''
   Deramus, who headed Kansas City Southern _ a diversified holding
company with major businesses in railroads and trucking _ during
its era of expansion and diversification, also was active in Kansas
City civic affairs.
   He was named Kansas Citian of the Year in 1985 by the Chamber of
Commerce of Greater Kansas City.
   Deramus was prononunced dead at Truman Medical Center on
Wednesday afternoon, but a cause of death was not released.
   ``He died suddenly at his desk, doing business,'' said Landon H.
Rowland, Kansas City Southern's president and chief executive
officer.
   Information regarding services had not been released late
Wednesday.
   Deramus, whose father joined Kansas City Southern in 1909 as
telegrapher in Pittsburg, Kan., began his railroad career in 1939
on the Wabash Railroad after receiving a law degree from Harvard
University. In 1949 at age 33, he became the youngest railroad
chief when he was named president of the old Chicago, Great Western
Railway.
   Deramus was credited with building up the struggling railroad,
and Chicago, Great Western reported a record profit of $3.4 million
in 1956. The next year, Deramus took over another line with
financial troubles, the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad. The
railroad, better known as the Katy, rebounded during Deramus' four
years of leadership.
   In 1961, Deramus was elected president of the Kansas City
Southern Railway Co. and its subsidiary, Louisiana &amp; Arkansas
Railway Co. Deramus succeeded his father, William N. Deramus.
   Deramus established Kansas City Southern Industries as a holding
company in the early 1960s. It was one of the first of its kind in
the railroad industry, and it expanded into fields such as life
insurance, real estate, broadcasting and data processing.

   The stock market advanced slightly today in a
muted response to news of a smaller-than-expected U.S. trade
deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .41 to 2,632.99
in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 520 up, 404 down and
580 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.69 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The business day began with a report from the Commerce
Department that the nation's trade deficit contracted to $7.94
billion in September from $10.10 billion the month before.
   The margin by which imports exceeded exports was the smallest in
nearly five years, and well below most advance estimates.
   The news helped the dollar post gains against leading foreign
currencies. But the response in the domestic bond market was less
enthusiastic.
   And stock-market observers said the decline in imports that
showed up in the trade data could be interpreted as evidence of
weakening consumer spending, at a time when many investors are
worried about the outlook for corporate profits.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet led the active list, down 1{ at 43 on top of a
5}-point drop Wednesday, when the company said it expects to post
lower earnings in 1990 as it revamps its credit-services business.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .04 to 188.72. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .69 at 372.84.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average gained 22.33
points to 2,632.58.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 920 up, 579 down and 468 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 155.13 million shares, against 143.17
million in the previous session.

<HEAD>Merrill Lynch Severs All Ties to South Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. is banning all business
related to South Africa, including trading or researching South
African securities, according to a published report today.
   The move by the country's biggest brokerage goes further than
similar policies of other securities firms and could encourage
others to take a tougher stance to protest South Africa's practices
of racial separation, The Wall Street Journal reported.
   The story appeared on a day when the South African government
announced the repeal of a major segregation law, called the
Separate Amenities Act.
   President F.W. de Klerk said the government will open all
whites-only beaches to blacks and repeal the law allowing local
authorities to segregate public facilities.
   Merrill Lynch's move, announced in an internal memorandum to
employees, reflects growing public outcry that Wall Street firms
continue to maintain ties to South Africa, the Journal said.
   Other financial firms, such as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
already don't do business with South Africa, its corporations and
individuals.
   The sweeping new policies reportedly mean Merrill Lynch will no
longer do securities research on South African companies and won't
offer investment recommendations on their stocks.
   Also, Merrill Lynch will no longer handle the buying or selling
of South African shares for customers. This extends to American
depositary receipts for South African stocks plus warrants and
other instruments. An ADR is a vehicle for U.S. investors to trade
in foreign securities.
   Researchers at Merrill Lynch will keep track of certain South
African industries, such as gold mining, but won't comment on
individual companies, the newspaper said.
   A spokesman for Merrill Lynch did not immediately return a
telephone call seeking comment on the report.

<TEXT>
   The cola wars have entered a new dimension, with
rivals Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola now in a fizz over the merits of
each other's hometown.
   Pepsi, based in Purchase, N.Y., recently took a swipe at Coke's
home base, Atlanta, in a handout to business students on an
employment recruiting trip to Northwestern University.
   The handout compared the relative merits of New York and Atlanta.
   The ``Pepsi Raffle'' challenge asked the students to match
statements with the correct city.
   On food, for example, it asked which city offers ``any food in
the world'' and which one has ``fat backs and grits?'' For
recreation, which one offers ``yachting'' or ``cow tipping?'' On
culture, which has the ``Metropolitan Museum of Art'' vs. the
``Stone Mountain Civil War Museum?''
   Coca-Cola issued a relatively restrained response this week:
``We're proud to call Atlanta home. What is cow tipping anyway?''
   But Gerald Bartels, president of Atlanta's Chamber of Commerce,
was a little more offended. ``I always thought of New Yorkers as
sophisticates and erudites. I'm surprised they would display their
naivete and ignorance so publicly.''

<HEAD>Unemployment Below 6 percent for First Time Since 1980</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate
fell below 6 percent for the first time since October 1980, the
government announced Thursday.
   It stood at 1.674 million, or 5.9 percent, in October, its 39th
consecutive monthly decline and down 1.7 percentage points from a
year ago, Employment Secretary Norman Fowler said.
   The opposition Labor Party, which claims the government is
massaging the figures by removing various categories from the
definition of unemployed, said the underlying trend gave cause for
``deep concern.''
   The party's employment spokesman, Tony Blair, said: ``Britain
will now end the 1980s with over 1.6 million unemployed, even on
the government's statistics, leaving many people facing the
prospect of yet another Christmas without a job, and thousands more
fearful of their job prospects at a time of high interest rates.''
   Fowler said Britain had the third lowest unemployment rate in
the 12-nation European Economic Community, and added that the rate
in Britain had fallen faster than in other Western industrialized
nations.
   But he warned that pay increases were averaging 9.1 percent,
well above the EEC mean of 6 percent. ``These kind of pay
settlements can only make us less competitive and therefore harm
future job prospects,'' he said.
   The highest regional level of joblessness was in Northern
Ireland, at 14.4 percent, followed by northern England at 8.9
percent, according to the government figures. The lowest level was
3.2 percent in eastern England.

   Three Swiss-franc traders at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange have been indicted as part of a sweeping
federal probe of corruption at the world's two largest futures
exchanges.
   The indictments, on charges of wire and mail fraud, and
violating commodity exchange laws, were announced Wednesday by U.S.
Attorney Anton Valukas as part of a long-range investigation by
federal authorities of the Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   Newly indicted were David Zatz of Chicago and Danny Scheck of
Skokie. They are the first traders to be indicted in connection
with the investigation since Aug. 2, when federal prosecutors
announced charges against 45 traders and one clerk.
   Both are charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud,
and violating the Commodity Exchange Act.
   Scheck's lawyer, Harvey Silets, said his client would fight the
accusations.
   ``We believe he will be fully vindicated and that the charges
will not result in any conviction because he's innocent,'' Silets
said.
   Zatz' attorney, Alan Blumenthal, said that although he had not
yet examined the indictment, ``we intend to go to trial.''
   Also named in the indictment was Robert Mosky, 33, of Chicago,
who had been charged previously in the probe. However, Wednesday's
indictment supercedes the previous one.
   The indictment increased to 80 from 63 the number of counts
against Mosky, who is charged with racketeering conspiracy, wire
fraud and mail fraud, and violations of the Commodity Exchange Act.
   Mosky's attorney, Jerry Samuels, said his client ``emphatically
denies any wrongdoing.''
   In all, 48 people have been charged in the investigation.
   Of the 46 others previously indicted, 13 have pleaded guilty, 30
have pleaded innocent and three have yet to be arraigned.
   The new indictment came just two days after Valukas, who
directed the investigation, announced he plans to resign next month
as federal prosecutor for northern Illinois to return to private
practice.

<HEAD>World Steel Output Fell In October From Year-Earlier Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude steel output in the non-Communist
world fell 4.6 percent in October from the corresponding
year-earlier month, the International Iron and Steel Institute said
Thursday.
   It dropped from 41.6 million tons in October last year to 39.7
million tons last month, Brussels-based IISI said.
   The decline was led by Japan where production fell 10 percent to
8.4 million tons. In the European Community, it fell 4.3 percent to
11.8 million tons and in the U.S., it dropped 4.1 percent to 7.25
million tons.
   In the first 10 months of 1989, steel output of non-Communist
countries rose 1.9 percent to 401.8 million tons from the
corresponding year-earlier period, IISI said.
   Its report covers 62 percent of world steel production.

   The stock market gave ground today in an
unenthusiastic response to news of a smaller-than-expected U.S.
trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.15 to 2,626.43
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 8 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 555 up, 620 down and
566 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 50.03 million shares at
midmorning.
   The business day began with a report from the Commerce
Department that the nation's trade deficit contracted to $7.94
billion in September from $10.10 billion the month before.
   The margin by which imports exceeded exports was the smallest in
nearly five years, and well below most advance estimates.
   The news helped the dollar post gains against leading foreign
currencies. But the response in the domestic bond market was less
enthusiastic.
   And stock-market observers said the decline in imports that
showed up in the trade data could be interpreted as evidence of
weakening consumer spending, at a time when many investors are
worried about the outlook for corporate profits.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet led the active list, down 2] at 42[ on top of a
5}-point drop Wednesday, when the company said it expects to post
lower earnings in 1990 as it revamps its credit-services business.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .28 to 188.48. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .53 at 372.68.

   Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Get your weight guessed,
your fortune told, your arteries clogged, test your strength, win a
stuffed animal, win two, one for the little lady, scare yourself
witless on a G-force ride.
   Welcome to the 71st trade show of the International Association
of Amusement Parks and Attractions.
   Despite all the glitz, bells and whistles at the show, one fact
shines like a carnival spotlight: Most of what's new on the Midway
has been there in various forms for a long, long time.
   At this year's show, the industry's biggest with more than 600
exhibitors, nostalgia runs neck-and-neck with computerized fantasy
for the carnival dollar.
   Tom Collins of Niagara Falls, Ontario, is selling a
weight-guessing scale for $24,500. It's a reproduction of one at
the Chicago's Century of Progress exposition, held 1933-34 along
the downtown lakefront.
   Weight-guessing has been a carnival staple since the 1890s, he
said, and is one of the only carnival games the customer doesn't
play.
   ``The guesser does the work,'' he said. ``We think it's a good
idea to dig out an old ideaand redo it.''
   Carousel dealers, too, agree that old is in.
   Tony Rae of the American Carousel Works of Diamond Bar, Calif.,
said the company's craftsmen still carve wooden horses. They don't
come cheap: $4,400 for the standard carousel horse.
   Intamin Service Corp.'s carousels, the brochure correctly notes,
look 100 years old. They are replicas of the old steam carousels,
and the horses are made from molds of the wooden originals.
   Barbara Zaichick and her husband, Gerald, of Miami, have
automated the Gypsy fortune teller, but they said their artists
were careful to keep the old theme.
   She said the newer video attractions and other modernizations of
the carnival trade ``are getting tired.''
   Her coin-operated fortune machines are good at telling you what
you want to hear.
   ``There is enough negative in the world,'' Mrs. Zaichick said.
   One taker was pronounced to be cultured, reserved, realistic,
ambitious, friendly, aesthetic, energetic, perceptive,
individualistic, enterprising, affectionate, sophisticated,
courageous, considerate, responsive, conventional, discriminating,
self-composed, disciplined and tender-hearted with a keen
foresight, quick mind and good memory.
   All true, and all for 50 cents.
   Another machine offers a sex analysis.
   Never mind.
   An Italian firm is marketing ``The Mouth of Truth,'' a replica
of a Roman stone museum piece. Put your hand in the mouth, and it
reads your hand and tells your future.
   The barker, the old-time pitchman and the sleazy looking ride
operator didn't make this year's show.
   But their bosses did, and they have their checkbooks. About
10,000 people in the industry are registered. More than 150 million
Americans will visit IAAPA member parks this year.
   The dart games, ducking stools and full-sized carnival rides
here are interspersed with the more basic ice machines, ticket
printers, fast-food equipment and carnival insurance companies that
bring it all back to Earth.
   But there's always room on the Midway for the novel such as the
Denson Funnel Cake Machine. It cranks out one deep-fried cake every
18 seconds, a sign notes.
   And there's the pigs.
   The Bob Hale Pig Racing Stables has 10 mobile units of 20 pigs
each and goes around the country to fairs and, increasingly, to
company picnics and other gatherings. The stables use the Asian
Pot-Bellied Pig and the Mexican hairless.
   ``Thrills, Chills, Spills and FUN!!'' promises the brochure.
``Up to 28 races a day!''
   Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

<HEAD>Carrier Struggling to Rebuild Keeps Low Winter Fares</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A move by money-losing Eastern Airlines to woo more
passengers by keeping cut-rate fares to Florida this winter has
been matched by Pan American World Airways, Eastern's closest
competitor in its Miami home market.
   After Eastern announced plans to continue its cheaper fares,
Midway Airlines also announced it will retain similar discount
fares on some seats. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the top
carrier out of Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood Airport, are studying the
lower rates.
   ``The existing fare structure...is a fare structure that is
doing nothing to stimulate travel into Florida,'' George Brennan,
Eastern's vice president for marketing, said Wednesday. ``Our
objective obviously is to make money.''
   ``We know a lot about Florida and how to stimulate travel,''
Brennan said. ``We have an awful lot of seats coming into Florida
this winter.''
   With relatively few restrictions, the fares go into effect
immediately for travel between nine Florida cities and 45 other
U.S. cities.
   While the airline industry normally boosts winter season fares
to vacation points such as Florida, Brennan said most of those
flying to the Sunshine State are discretionary, or leisure,
travelers and Eastern must offer incentives.
   ``It is used more as a marketing tool to attract attention,''
said Robert Joedicke, an airline analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton. ``It's calculated to create a loss, but it's calculated to
regain critical mass, or market share. (Eastern must) be
particularly active to win people back.''
   A Miami-to-New York fare, based on roundtrip purchase, would be
$99 each way midweek, compared with a current price of $139.
   Eastern in many cases is maintaining discount fares aimed at
regaining market share lost since the airline was hit March 4 by a
strike and entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization five days
later.
   Passengers must make reservations before Dec. 15, and purchase
their tickets _ if space is available _ seven days in advance.
Tickets are fully refundable, Brennan said. Reservations can be
made through 1990, and will be honored with seven-day advance
purchase.
   A two-night stay is required for the fares, but the discounts
are not limited to the weekend, according to Brennan. Normal fares
apply during the blackout dates Dec. 21-26 southbound (into
Florida) and Jan. 1-3 northbound (out of Florida).
   A slightly higher fare structure is to become effective Jan. 6,
offering discounts still below industry norms, but about $20 higher
each way than the bargain fares.
   Miami-based Eastern currently flies 335 flights in and out of
nine Florida cities: Miami, Fort Lauderdale, West Palm Beach,
Tampa, Orlando, Daytona Beach, Sarasota, Fort Myers, and Melbourne.
   The Eastern announcement came after last week's third-quarter
report showed losses of $185.2 million, with indications creditors
have been told of the carrier's cash shortfall.
   Eastern officials are trying to rebuild without the unions. They
have said the airline will emerge from bankruptcy in early 1990 at
nearly 90 percent its pre-strike size.
   The airline has 775 daily flights. It had nearly 1,100 before
the strike.

   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said today
the expected quick easing of Soviet emigration laws will open up
the Soviet Union for most-favored-nation trade status with the
United States.
   And Soviet Ambassador Yuri V. Dubinin, calling the new
legislation a ``breakthrough'' and ``the first of its kind'' in the
history of his country, anticipated a positive U.S. response.
   At a news conference at the Soviet embassy, Dubinin said
conversations with U.S. officials had not produced any specific
assurances that U.S. barriers to Soviet exports would be lowered.
   But, he said, ``We are expecting positive steps from the
American side.''
   The legislation, on its way to final approval, will vastly ease
restrictions on permanent and temporary travel abroad by Soviet
citizens.
   One major change provides a broad right to passports good for
five years abroad. Another limits to five years the period for
which Soviet citizens can be denied visas after working on a
security-sensitive job.
   Dubinin said the legislation ``will create legal guarantees for
assuring the human right to leave any country _ or to return.''
   ``I think that we're going to see them moving quickly to pass
this emigration bill and then that will open it up for the
most-favored-nation treatment, which will lower tariffs,''
Mosbacher said on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``And it will make it
easier for the Soviets to sell to us.''
   Asked when the Soviets might get the more advantageous trade
status, Mosbacher said: ``I would guess it would be within the next
one to three months.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, meeting at the White House with
Konstantin Katushev, the Soviet mnister for foreign economic
relations, said, ``We certainly hope that there'll be positive
developments in liberalizing their emigration policies. Any
positive steps taken in that direction will be very helpful in
changing our position.''
   A draft law lifting most travel restrictions on Soviets passed
its first legislative hurdle Monday in Moscow. The bill allows
emigration for virtually anyone who has entry permission from
another country and no outstanding alimony obligations, criminal
charges or recent knowledge of state secrets.
   It was given preliminary approval by the Supreme Soviet
legislature Monday and formalizes many changes that have already
been put into practice in Soviet emigration and travel policy.
   Mosbacher said ``unfortunately for them,'' the Soviets do not
have much that the United States wants to buy, mentioning
``petroleum and vodka and caviar and not much else.''
   ``The Soviets desperately need Western currency, hard
currency,'' he said. ``They also realize in the long term the only
way they're going to get this is investments, U.S. and other
compnaies over there. What they want is U.S. companies to come
over, make investments.''
   On Oct. 26, President Bush extended most-favored-nation status
to Hungary, making it the first country to be freed from a 1974 law
denying U.S. trade credits to most communist nations.
   The action gives the recipient nation full access to U.S.
markets and the lowest possible tariff rates, putting it on an
equal footing with major U.S. trading partners.
   The law requires an annual report to Congress from the president
on the emigration policies of each nation covered under the
restriction, and an assessment of whether there has been progress
toward unrestricted emigration.

   The AFL-CIO was urged today to adopt a
pro-choice stance in the national debate over abortion, an issue
that has sharply divided labor leaders gathered to celebrate their
unity.
   The sponsors of six resolutions calling on the federation to
take a pro-choice position agreed to put the issue to further study
in exchange for a debate on the subject today, the final day of a
gathering highlighted by speeches by Polish Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa and President Bush.
   Nine speakers, including two men, spoke in favor of adopting a
pro-choice stance before the issue was referred to the Executive
Council for study. No one spoke against the resolutions, although
pro-life forces within the labor movement are expeated to lobby the
council heavily for their position.
   ``The labor movement must choose sides and lead as we always
have,'' Susan Cowell, vice president of the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union, said in urging the federation's Executive
Council to study the issue quickly and endorse a pro-choice stance.
   ``We did not choose this issue,'' she said. ``The Reagan court
has forced us to take on this issue. Labor cannot stand on the
sidelines.''
   The abortion issue has proved a divisive one for a number of
reasons, pitting traditional labor factions that long have
advocated staying neutral against a vocal coalition of women labor
activists demanding that the federation take a stand.
   Those women say going on the record against last year's Supreme
Court decision expanding state's rights to limit abortions and
Bush's recent vetoes of legislation providing federal funding for
some abortions would put labor in line with its traditional allies,
including the Democratic Party, and help it recruit women.
   Others, however, argue that a pro-choice stance would hurt
labor's standing among Hispanics, most of whom are Catholic, many
religious organizations and in conservative states.
   Cowell said advocates of the pro-choice resolutions would push
for the federation's Executive Council to decide the issue by its
February meeting and suggest language that would allow it to take a
pro-choice stance while recognizing moral and religious concerns.
   If pro-choice resolutions did come up for a vote, it is widely
believed they would be defeated, leaving labor in an awkward
position at a time most of its political allies are helping
mobilize pro-choice forces.
   ``That's certainly not a bastion of liberalism in there,''
William Lucy, vice president of the American Federation of State,
County and Municipal Employees, said of the 800 delegates.
   Susan Bianchi-Sand, president of the Association of Flight
Attendants and a newly elected member of the council, is being
pressed by sponsors of the pro-choice resolutions to lobby the
council.
   In an interview Wednesday, she would say only that the issue
``deserves to be looked at seriously.''
   Her union is on the record in favor of choice, but Bianchi-Sand
said she had not decided whether the federation should take a
position.
   Bush's Wednesday address to the delegates was criticized by
labor leaders because he avoided discussing his numerous
differences with labor. He praised AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland
and the role of the federation in helping Solidarity and other
union movements around the world.
   ``Through the labor movement, democracy is finding its voice,''
Bush said.
   But he steered clear of his differences with labor over issues
ranging from child care to the Eastern Airlines strike except to
say, ``I know we have differences.''
   At the end of the speech, some delegates began chanting, ``Sign
the bill,'' a reference to legislation that would create a special
congressional panel to investigate the 8-month-old Eastern strike.
   Administration officials have said Bush likely will veto the
measure.
   ``He very skillfully avoided dealing with several of the very
difficult issues that affect American workers,'' Lucy said.

   Steel imports in September decreased 8.6
percent from August and were down 18.6 percent for the first nine
months of the year, an industry group said Thursday.
   Steel imports in September totaled 1.4 million tons, compared
with 1.5 million tons in August and 1.6 million tons in September
1988, the American Iron and Steel Institute reported.
   Imports for the first nine months of the year fell to 13 million
tons, compared with 16 million tons in the same period last year,
the Washington, D.C.-based trade group said.
   The American Institute for Imported Steel, which represents
leading steel importers and exporters, said imports for the first
nine months amounted to 15.3 percent of domestic demand when
semifinished steel bound for U.S. mills is excluded.
   The steel import group noted the percentage without semifinished
steel is below the Bush administration's Voluntary Restraint
Agreements target of 18.5 percent of imported steel in the domestic
market.
   Steel exports in September totaled 363,849, down 21.1 percent
from August, the importers' group said. In September 1988, American
steel manufacturers exported 206,760 tons.

<TEXT>
   When auto worker Lars-Ola Melzig moved into
the new Saab car assembly plant last month, he found himself deep
in paperwork.
   Inspection instructions, work manuals and attendance reports
were things he never had to deal with before. Now he even is
involved in hiring new staff for his production team.
   Not that he regrets the extra work.
   ``It's fun to have a job with responsibility,'' said Melzig, 23,
who is a leader of a six-man team building Saab's upscale passenger
cars. ``Assembling cars is now a good job.''
   Melzig is one of the workers in Saab-Scania AB's new Malmo
factory, which takes innovative Swedish manufacturing labor
practices a step further in reducing mind-numbing drudgery and
increasing worker responsibility for such areas as quality control
and day-to-day management.
   ``You can't build a first-class car with workers whom you
consider to have second-class jobs,'' says Henry Selenius, the
plant's general manager.
   In labor-starved Sweden, industries must compete to attract and
keep workers. With an unemployment rate of just 1.5 percent,
laborers can pick and choose their workplace.
   The assembly line is gone at Saab's new $150 million plant.
Replacing it is what the company calls ``parallel assembly,'' or
autonomous work teams of up to 10 people who assemble a larger part
of the unit and do their own quality control.
   Each team, equipped with a personal computer, plans its daily
work ration and orders the materials it needs. It also draws up a
rotation of jobs within the group and files reports comparing
results with management's targets.
   Workers _ here they're called ``car-builders'' _ start their day
with a company-provided breakfast, followed by a team planning
session against a backdrop of tropical flowers and water ponds.
   The Saab factory is light and spacious, with walls and equipment
in matching colors and a cubistic net of shimmering pipes on the
ceiling.
   Escalators have replaced stairways. A chessboard is painted on
the floor of the rest area and it's not unusual to find workers
playing with king-sized chess pieces during their lunch hour.
   There's also a grocery store and the top-floor restaurant
commands a view over the Oresund sound between Sweden and Denmark.
A company doctor offers specialist treatment for back strain, which
is the scourge of many factories.
   In another innovation, the work team is responsible for
computer-controlled quality tests before sending the car to its
next assembly station.
   ``Our goal is that the car-builders themselves should be able to
correct any defects and in future use their experience to assist
the engineers ... in changing the construction to eliminate
entirely the source of the defect,'' Selenius said.
   Some of Sweden's largest companies began dismantling the
standard assembly lines in the early 1970s, freeing workers from
the repetitive single-task work day.
   When Saab took down the line in 1972 at its gasoline engine
plant, production costs increased but the company claimed its
employees did higher quality work, Selenius said.
   Other factories were slow to follow, said Stig Marklund, of the
Metal Workers' Confederation. But now the practice is becoming more
common, he said, citing such companies as Alfa Laval AB and car
maker Volvo AB among the converted.
   Marklund said other European manufacturers, facing a long-term
decline in the size of their work force, had expressed interest in
the Swedish concept.
   Under Sweden's welfare laws, all workers get a minimum annual
five-week holiday and overtime may be compensated in extra time
off, which many workers prefer to highly taxed cash payments.
   Mothers or fathers are guaranteed 15 months of parental leave
after the arrival of a newborn. Paid sick leave can apply also for
those who stay home to care for a sick child or aged parent. Unpaid
study-leave of up to a year is available without risk of losing a
job.
   One result of the system is chronic absenteeism. Saab's rate has
been as high as 25 percent, but Selenius said the first three
months in Malmo showed an 8 percent decrease in absenteeism.
   Saab also wants to revamp the salary system, which is strictly
controlled by union contracts, to give greater flexibility and more
reward for experience and merit. Monthly salaries are average for
the sector, starting at the equivalent of $1,613, or about $937
after tax.

<HEAD>British Telecom Reports 8.5 Percent Increase in After-Tax Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Telecommunications PLC reported Thursday
an 8.5 percent increase in after-tax profit for the first half of
the year.
   British Telecom Chairman Iain Vallance said that despite the
slowdown in the British economy, the company should ``make
continuing progress in the second half.''
   Vallance said the company's domestic investment program ``is
paying off,'' with improved services helping to ``ensure profitable
growth in the future.''
   Profit after taxes rose to 867 million pounds, or $1.37 billion,
in the first half from 799 million pounds a year earlier, while
earnings per share rose to 14.2 pence, or 22.4 cents, from 13.2
pence.
   A 10 percent rise in sales helped offset high interest payments
to finance the company's $1.5 billion purchase of a 22-percent
stake in McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the biggest U.S.
cellular telephone company.
   Overall sales rose to 5.95 billion pounds, or $9.40 billion, in
the six months ended Sept. 30 from 5.41 billion pounds the previous
year.
   Its operating profit increased 9.4 percent to 1.53 billion
pounds, or $2.42 billion, from 1.40 billion pounds a year earlier.
   Pretax profit rose to 1.313 billion pounds, or $2.08 billion,
from 1.239 billion pounds in the first half of 1988.
   Net profit attributable to shareholders, or after-tax profit
minus minority interests, rose 7.9 percent to 857 million pounds,
or $1.35 billion, from 794 million pounds the previous year.
   Interest costs rose 36 percent to 220 million pounds, or $347.6
million, from 162 million pounds due to the cost of financing
British Telecom's investment in McCaw.
   British Telecom bought into McCaw, based in Kirkland, Wash.,
last January as part of its plans to compete globally in mobile
telephone communications.
   The company also owns 60 percent of Cellnet, a British cellular
phone concern. Cellnet is growing rapidly, the company said, and
increased capital spending in that area is planned.

<HEAD>After-Tax Profit Up 31 Percent At British Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Steel PLC, Europe's largest publicly-owned
steel maker, said Thursday its after-tax profit rose 31 percent in
the latest six-month period due to strong profit margins and a
lower than expected exceptional charge.
   The company reported profit after tax and minority interests of
332 million pounds, or $524.6 million, in the six months ended
Sept. 30. That compared with a net of 253 million pounds in the
same period last year.
   Earnings per share rose to 16.6 pence, the equivalent of 26.2
cents, from 12.6 pence a year earlier.
   Group sales rose to 2.55 billion pounds, or $4.03 billion, from
2.33 billion pounds a year earlier.
   British steel had an extraordinary loss of 45 million pounds
stemming from future reorganization costs.
   Operating profit rose 35 percent to 388 million pounds, or $613
million, from 287 million last year.
   Pretax profit rose to 423 million pounds, or $668 million, from
270 million pounds during the same period last year.
   British Steel said the six-month period was distinguished by
``buoyant trading conditions and good plant performance.'' But the
company warned that high British inflation and weakening steel
demand might affect operating profit in the second half of the year
and said it would continue its cost-cutting efforts.
   In the past two years, demand for steel products, particularly
in Britain, has soared, enabling British Steel to post strong rises
in profits.
   But Robert Scholey, Chairman of British Steel, said: ``Overall
steel demand is slightly fading after running well over the average
trend.''
   In Britain, Scholey said, ``the company wasn't doing too badly
but that demand will probably go down.'' He said he hopes the
company's prices ``can hold up,'' and forecast that full-year
1989-90 pretax profits would surpass last year's.
   ``It is likely that the weaker market conditions in Britain will
carry over into next year's trading profit, although market
conditions in mainland Europe are expected to remain relatively
strong,'' he said.

   Assets of the nation's 478 money market mutual
funds fell $200.8 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline, to $363.61 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a $3.92 billion increase in the funds' assets
the previous week to a record high $363.81 billion, according to
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 235 general purpose funds fell $354.3 million to $118.79
billion, assets of 97 broker-dealer funds decreased $13.1 million
to $157.39 billion, and assets of 146 institutional funds rose
$166.6 million to $87.43 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 8.01 percent from 8.07 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 8.09 percent from 8.14 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, up from 42 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.38 percent as of Wednesday from 6.40 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.08 percent, unchanged from a week earlier.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 8.11
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 8.16
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.16 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.21 percent; 8.09 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.14
percent; and 8.09 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.14 percent.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. said Thursday it is
discontinuing all business related to racially segregated South
Africa, including trading or researching South African securities.
   The move by the country's largest brokerage, which broadens a
policy in place since September 1987, was the latest move by a Wall
Street firm to protest South Africa's apartheid policies.
   ``The new policy is significantly more comprehensive than
required by federal law and meets the criteria of anti-apartheid
initiatives that have been adopted or are under consideration by
various state and local governments in the United States,'' Merrill
Lynch spokesman Fred Yager said.
   Under the sweeping new policy, Merill Lynch and its subsidiaries
will no longer engage in any financial or commercial transactions
with the South African government, any of its agencies or any
corporation or individuals organized or residing in the country.
   The company will not conduct securities research on South
African companies or offer investment recommendations on their
stocks, effective immediately. Researchers will continue to respond
to questions from the company's sales force on developments and
trends in South Africa until Jan. 31.
   Also, Merrill Lynch will not buy or sell South African shares
for customers. This extends to American depositary receipts for
South African stocks plus options, warrants and other instruments.
An ADR is a vehicle for U.S. investors to trade in foreign
securities.
   Researchers at Merrill Lynch will continue to keep track of the
South African gold and precious metals industry as part of a global
overview. But the company said it won't offer opinions on
individual South African mining companies.
   ``Because of the importance of South Africa in terms of global
gold production, it is necessary to be aware of production trends
in that market in order to be able to fully assess the outlook for
gold,'' Yager said.
   The revised policy was outlined in an internal corporate
memorandum to employees. The company has periodically reviewed its
policy since implementing restrictions on its dealings with South
Africa in 1987.
   Other investment firms, such as Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.,
already refuse to do business with South Africa. Numerous other
firms have curtailed their South African connections to comply with
legal requirements.
   The news of Merrill Lynch's toughened policy came on a day when
the South African government announced the repeal of a major
segregation law, called the Separate Amenities Act.
   President F.W. de Klerk said the government will open all
whites-only beaches to blacks and repeal the law allowing local
authorities to segregate public facilities.
   Accounts maintained for customers residing in South Africa will
be closed as of Jan. 31.
   Previously, Merrill Lynch had various prohibitions on South
African dealings, some implemented to comply with laws.
   The company had not conducted business in the country, owned or
run any operations there or bough or sold South African gold coins
or other commodities. Also, Merrill Lynch did not engage in any
transaction that would have involved paying taxes or duties to the
South African government, the company said.

   The dollar rallied Thursday on news of a big
improvement in the country's trade balance but finished below its
best levels due to technically motivated selling.
   Gold prices edged up in U.S. trading after posting sharp gains
overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery ended at $391.40 a troy ounce, up 10 cents from
Wednesday's settlement. The Republic National Bank of New York
quoted an ounce of gold at $391.30 as of 4 p.m. EST, 40 cents
higher than Wednesday's late bid.
   The dollar got off to a strong start in U.S. foreign exchange
trading. It gained support from a report that the nation's
merchandise trade deficit tumbled to $7.9 billion in September, the
smallest monthly deficit in nearly five years.
   But the deficit's unexpectedly sharp decline caught some
currency investors unprepared and forced them to adjust their
holdings by selling dollars. The market had anticipated a deficit
of about $8.9 billion.
   Rumors that the Federal Reserve Board was selling dollars to
mute the rally accentuated the downtrend that had been touched off
by the technically-oriented sales. The Fed never comments on any
day-to-day currency transactions. Some dealers said they doubted
the central bank had actually intervened.
   Mixed emotions about what the Commerce Department's trade report
meant also snuffed out some of the enthusiasm to buy dollars. One
interpretation was that the slowdown in imports underscored the
weakness in U.S. economic growth, which would strengthen the case
for lower interest rates.
   A decline in U.S. interest rates would tend to lessen demand for
dollars and make returns on dollar-denominated investments less
attractive.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo with a rise of 0.48
Japanese yen to close at 143.85 yen. Later, in London, it edged up
to 143.90 yen and rose to 144.25 yen in New York from 143.795 on
Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.5805 from $1.5810 late
Wednesday. The pound fetched $1.5755 late in New York, compared to
$1.5803 Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
quotes, included: 1.8427 West German marks, up from 1.8390; 1.6326
Swiss francs, up from 1.6265; 6.2725 French francs, up from 6.2495;
1,357.25 Italian lire, up from 1,351.75; and 1.16875 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1709.
   Selected late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
rates late on Wednesday, were: 1.8375 West German marks, down from
1.8382; 1.6290 Swiss francs, up from 1.6220; 6.2550 French francs,
up from 6.2420; 2.0750 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0790; 1,354.00
Italian lire, up from 1,348.25, and 1.1700 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1726.
   Precious metals prices rose sharply in trading abroad.
   Gold bullion rose to a seven-month high in active trading in
London, where it was bid late in the day at $393 a troy ounce, up
from $391.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to $392.50
from $391 late Wednesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.32 an ounce to $389.62.
   Silver bullion jumped to a six-month high of $5.60 a troy ounce
in London from $5.49 bid late Wednesday. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.582 a troy ounce,
up from $5.528 Wednesday.

   The stock market churned in place Thursday,
getting little benefit from news of a smaller-than-expected U.S.
trade deficit.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.08 to 2,635.66.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 735 up, 748
down and 498 unchanged.
   The business day began with a report from the Commerce
Department that the nation's trade deficit contracted to $7.94

   The margin by which imports exceeded exports was the smallest in

   The news helped the dollar post gains against leading foreign

enthusiastic.
   And stock-market observers said the decline in imports that
showed up in the trade data could be interpreted as evidence of
weakening consumer spending, at a time when many investors are
worried about the outlook for corporate profits.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet led the active list, down 2 at 42{ on top of a
5}-point drop Wednesday, when the company said it expects to post
lower earnings in 1990 as it revamps its credit-services business.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose } to
57{; Philip Morris gained ] to 41[, and American Express was up 1[
at 34|. But International Business Machines dropped } to 97[.
   The General Services Administration said it was investigating
IBM's sale to the government of used computer equipment marked as
new.
   Expectations of lower interest rates helped electric utility
issues gain ground, pushing Dow Jones's average of 15 utilities up
.82 to 222.40, its highest close in more than two years.
   ``Electric utilities, with their monopoly franchises, high
yields and modest but predictable earnings growth are particularly
attractive in today's investment environment,'' wrote analyst Barry
Abramson at Prudential-Bache Securities in a report published this
week on the group.
   Hilton Hotels fell 5} to 96. The company said its directors
discussed ``expressions of interest'' from prospective acquirers.
But its statement apparently disappointed traders who had been
hoping for concrete news of an offer.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 148.37 million
shares, against 155.13 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 178.81 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $0.94 billion, or 0.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .01 to 188.75.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index dropped .11 to 388.05, while
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .04 at 340.58.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
.56 to 455.28. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 372.51, up .36.

   Energy futures prices advanced Thursday, led by
a surge in demand for home heating oil.
   The December contract for heating oil soared 1.66 cents to 58.79
cents a gallon in New York Mercantile Exchange trading as colder
weather was predicted for many parts of the country. Subsequent
contract months also posted strong gains.
   Heating oil prices are sensitive to changes in the weather. On
Wednesday, warmer weather in the East sent the December contract
0.32 cent lower.
   Crude oil futures also moved higher. The December contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, picked
up 19 cents to close at $19.86 a 42-gallon barrel, following a 17
cent gain Wednesday.
   And wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery rose 0.70
cent to settle at 51.31 cents a gallon, compounding a 0.30 cent
rise the previous session.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy market analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said a rally in European markets set
the stage for Thursday's domestic gains.
   Speculation that heating oil would be in short supply in the
Soviet Union sent prices higher overseas, and the momentum carried
over to U.S. trading, where seasonal factors also came into play,
Lebow said.

   Champion International Corp. said Thursday

writing paper mill.
   J. Douglas Banks, Champion's operations manager at the plant,
said in a statement that the layoffs were needed to help the mill
compete in a difficult worldwide market for premium papers.
   The plant previously employed 1,845 people, Banks said. He said
154 hourly employees were laid off and 12 salaried workers lost

   Banks said Champion would negotiate severance payments with
union leaders for the hourly workers and would offer to help

<HEAD>Warm-Up of Soviet Relations Boosts Grain Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid hopes that the warming of U.S.-Soviet relations
would lead to greater grain sales to the Russians.
   But analysts were skeptical, saying the Soviets already seem
able to buy as much grain as they want.
   On other commodity markets Thursday, coffee prices fell sharply;
heating oil surged, leading the energy complex higher; precious
metals were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   In Chicago, wheat futures settled 2{ cents to 4 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.07{ a bushel; corn
was { cent to 2 cents higher with December at $2.40\ a bushel; oats
were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with December at $1.47\ a bushel;
soybeans were 3{ cents to 5{ cents higher with November at $5.84\ a
bushel.
   Most of the buying stemmed from comments made Thursday by
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who said the expected easing
of Soviet emigration laws would open up the Soviet Union for
most-favored-trade status with the United States.
   Most-favored nations have full access to U.S. markets at the
lowest possible tariff rates.
   The Soviet Union's restrictive emigration policies have
prohibited it from being considered for most-favored-nation trading
status, but the United States has allowed the Soviets to buy
millions of tons of U.S. grain and even subsidized Soviet purchases
of wheat.
   ``The Soviets already buy large amounts of grain around the
world and they probably already buy at their maximum level,'' said
Walter Spilka, a grain-market analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   He said the effective ceiling on Soviet grain purchases is set
by their own limited port capacity, not by restrictions on how much
they can buy.
   Analyst William Biedermann agreed that lowering trade
restrictions would not likely increase Soviet purchases of U.S.
grain immediately, but it might in the long term if it means the
Soviets can buy grain more cheaply.
   Coffee futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange amid nervousness about Thursday's voting in the Brazilian
presidential election. Brazil is the world's largest coffee
producer.
   News of significant rainfall in Brazilian coffee-growing regions
also prompted selling of futures.
   Coffee settled 2.4 cents to 4.12 cents lower with December at
72.89 cents a pound.
   Heating-oil futures surged on on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as frigid temperatures moved into the Midwest and headed
for the Northeast.
   Analysts said crude-oil futures also got a boost from
speculative buying ahead of an OPEC meeting that begins this
weekend in Vienna.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 24 cents
higher with December at $19.86 a barrel; heating oil was .95 cent
to 1.66 cents higher with December at 58.79 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .60 cent to .80 cent higher with December at
51.31 cents a gallon.
   Silver futures climbed higher in a technically inspired rally on
New York's Commodity Exchange, extending the sharp gains registered
on Wednesday. Gold was little changed.
   Gold settled 10 cents lower across the board with December at
$392.70 a troy ounce; silver was 5.4 cents to 6.1 cents higher with
December at $5.595 a troy ounce.
   Cattle futures slipped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,
reflecting ideas that Wednesday's gains were overdone. Pork futures
were mixed amid disappointment over the government's rejection of
initial offers from dealers for pork bellies that the government
plans to buy and send to Poland.
   Cattle futures settled .25 cent to .48 cent lower with December
at 74.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent
lower with November at 83.10 cents a pound; live hogs were .15 cent
lower to .28 cent higher with December at 49.15 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .35 cent lower to .75 cent higher with
February at 63.52 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Pepsi Calls Recruitment Quiz It Distributed `Insulting' To Atlanta</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A job recruitment quiz distributed by a Pepsi
Cola employee was denounced Thursday by Pepsi officials, who called
it ``insulting'' for its digs at Atlanta _ the hometown of the soft
drink maker's chief rival Coca-Cola.
   The quiz poked fun at the eating habits, leisure activities and
sophistication of Atlanta, home of The Coca-Cola Co., comparing the
city unfavorably with New York. Pepsi Cola Co. is based in
Purchase, N.Y., a suburb of New York City.
   The handout, distributed recently to business students during a
Pepsi employment recruiting trip to Northwestern University in
Chicago, asked the students to match statements with the correct
city.
   For example, it asked which city offers ``any food in the
world'' and which one has ``fat backs and grits.'' For recreation
it asked which had ``yachting'' or ``cow tipping.'' On culture, the
choices were ``Metropolitan Museum of Art'' or the ``Stone Mountain
Civil War Museum.''
   Word of the handout surfaced in Atlanta when The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution published a story about the quiz on Thursday.
   Coca-Cola's relatively restrained response stated: ``We're proud
to call Atlanta home. What is cow tipping anyway?''
   Cow tipping refers to a prank in which people attempt to knock
over a sleeping cow. The reference to ``fat backs'' apparently
meant fatback, an ingredient in some Southern dishes.
   Gerald Bartels, president of Atlanta's Chamber of Commerce, was
a little more offended. ``I always thought of New Yorkers as
sophisticates and erudites. I'm surprised they would display their
naivete and ignorance so publicly,'' he said.
   Spokesman Tod MacKenzie at company headquarters said Pepsi
officials still were trying to determine the origin of the quiz,
but they were sure it was the work of a Pepsi employee.
   ``The quiz was a terrible prank and done in extremely poor
taste,'' MacKenzie said. ``It was insulting. We don't condone it
and it is not part of our recruitment strategy.''
   MacKenzie said Pepsi has about 8,800 employees in the Atlanta
area.
   Ron Tidmore, president of Dallas-based Pepsi South, the parent
company's Southern operation, said he received a few calls Thursday
from consumers who had heard of the quiz and were ``upset and
concerned.''
   ``We tried to explain the whole thing was done in poor taste,''
Tidmore said.
   ``I was upset when I heard about it myself,'' said Tidmore, a
native of Columbiana, Ala., and a graduate of the University of
Georgia. ``Whoever did it obviously has never spent any time in the
South.''
   He said the person responsible would be ``dealt with,'' but he
would not say if the person would be fired. ``It was just bad
judgement. It probably was a very junior level person who did
something they thought was cute and didn't understand the
ramifications,'' Tidmore said.
   Tidmore said the company did not plan to run advertisements
apologizing for the incident because that would only attract more
attention to it.

   Eastern Airlines reported quick and heavy response
Thursday to its cut-rate winter air fares to Florida, and two
competitors matched the rebuilding carrier's new fares.
   Pan American World Airways, a major competitor in Florida and
second to Eastern in Miami service, immediately matched Eastern's
fares, as did Midway Airlines. Officials at two other key
competitors in Florida, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines, said
they were still considering responses.
   Eastern, losing some $2 million a day as it struggles to
overcome an 8-month-old strike and emerge from Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization, on Wednesday moved to build up its
passenger base by offering fares as low as $79 one way in Florida
during the peak winter travel season.
   ``Our agents are experiencing very, very heavy call volume,''
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said. ``It started last night and is
continuing today.''
   In a separate development Thursday, Texas Air Corp. announced
that Eastern's sister carrier Continental Airlines has agreed to
buy 40 foreign-made Airbus jets in a deal valued at about $4.5
billion.
   The move is the latest example of parent company Texas Air
building up Continental to the detriment of money-losing Eastern,
pilots union spokesman Skip Orr charged.
   Matell said Eastern officials knew they could be triggering a
winter fare war.
   ``Let's face it, anytime you file a fare that offers a
competitive advantage you always run the risk of the other carriers
matching,'' Matell said.
   Some independent analysts say such lowball fare promotions do
little to help airlines improve a crucial passenger base _ business
travelers who aren't as responsive to lower fares as discretionary
fliers who fly infrequently.
   But Matell said Eastern is trying to get any and all passengers.
   ``Our approach on something like this is to stimulate traffic
and to generate passengers who might otherwise not have traveled,
given the existing fare structure,'' Matell said. ``We're in the
process of rebuilding our market share because of the strike and
the long-term effects it's had.''
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon in New York said the carrier
felt compelled to match Eastern.
   ``We certainly want to remain competitive in that market,'' she
said, adding that although Pan Am didn't welcome a fare war, ``The
decision was easily made ... We'll match all of them.''
   With relatively few restrictions, Eastern's fares went into
effect immediately for travel between nine Florida cities and 45
other U.S. cities.
   A Miami-to-New York fare, based on roundtrip purchase, would be
$99 each way midweek, compared with a current price of $139.
   Passengers must make reservations before Dec. 15, and purchase
their tickets _ if space is available _ seven days in advance.
Tickets are fully refundable, and reservations can be made through
1990.
   A two-night stay is required for the fares, but the discounts
are not limited to the weekend. Normal fares apply during the
blackout dates Dec. 21-26 southbound (into Florida) and Jan. 1-3
northbound (out of Florida).
   A slightly higher fare structure is to become effective Jan. 6,
offering discounts still below industry norms, but about $20 higher
each way than the bargain fares.

<HEAD>Hoylake May Put Cash in BAT Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment group trying to acquire BAT
Industries PLC in what would be Britain's biggest takeover said
Thursday it may include a cash component in a revised version of
its highly leveraged offer.
   Hoylake Investments Ltd. said it was considering offering cash
in place of some of the debt instruments in the original 13.3
billion-pound, $21 billion, offer, but would keep the value of the
offer at 850 pence, or $13.40, a share.
   BAT Industries said it was advising shareholders to take no
action because the proposals ``do not constitute an offer and ...
are not binding.''
   Hoylake is the investment vehicle set up by financiers James
Goldsmith, Jacob Rothschild and Kerry Packer to bid for the BAT
group.
   The original bid had technically lapsed while awaiting U.S.
regulatory approval. Meanwhile, BAT shareholders have voted to sell
off some of its holdings to bring in about $4 billion and fortify
the conglomerate against Hoylake.
   In a statement, Hoylake indicated it might offer cash instead of
the 20 percent of the bid package made up of Hoylake loan stock.
The balance would consist of Hoylake senior debt, as originally
planned, or cash or a mixture of cash and debt.
   Hoylake's statement, made as the preamble to the release of a
revised filing with U.S. insurance regulators, said the cash would
be raised partly by selling Hoylake equity to Anglo Group PLC, a
holding company controlled by Goldsmith and Rothschild.
   The original terms have been snubbed by many European investors
and analysts as too debt-dependent.
   The Goldsmith group initially said its offer was worth 850 pence
a share, though the valuation was later raised to 878 pence.
   No arrangements have been made for underwriting or placement of
the debt securities, Hoylake said, because it is not free to make a
fresh offer for BAT until it has won all the U.S. regulatory
clearances related to its plans to sell Farmers Group, BAT's U.S.
insurance unit.
   Once it wins the approval, it can bid anew within 21 days.
   Hoylake said a new offer would be subject to largely the same
conditions as the original offer and would be conditional on the
previously announced agreement for the sale of Farmers to France's
Axa Midi Assurances for $4.5 billion.
   Hoylake said the consideration it would offer BAT shareholders
for their shares could be reduced depending on how much the value
of BAT's equity is changed by its restructuring.
   In a statement issued late Thursday in New York, Farmers said,
``We believe that the information released by Goldsmith does little
to enlighten anyone. The so-called details he provides are still
based purely on speculation and conjecture, with no indication that
financing will be available for what continues to be a debt-laden,
hypothetical scheme.''
   Under the deal, Farmers would be ``exposed to the financial
condition of Goldsmith's takeover vehicle,'' the statement said.

   Chickens are slaughtered in conditions so
filthy that bugs crawl on the walls, the floors are slick with
blood and guts, and when carcasses fall in the muck, they are
picked up and tossed back on the line, a former poultry worker told
a congressional panel Thursday.
   ``As a result, consumers get chicken that we wouldn't feed to
our dogs,'' Donna Bazemore said in testimony submitted to the House
Education and Labor subcommittee on labor-management relations.
   The subcommittee is considering legislation to standardize the
treatment and protection of whistleblowers.
   Bazemore, a former worker at a Perdue Industries poultry plant
in North Carolina, was in a car accident Wednesday and could not
appear before the subcommittee, said Tom Devine, a lawyer with the
Government Accountability Project who represents her.
   But her testimony described conditions straight out of Upton
Sinclair's ``The Jungle,'' a 1906 expose of the Chicago meatpacking
industry.
   ``To start with, the plants are filthy,'' Bazemore said in her
testimony. ``The floors regularly are covered with grease, fat, snd
and roaches. Bugs are up and down the sides of the walls. ...
Chickens regularly fall off the line and into all the muck on the
floor. The supervisors have workers put them back on the line.''
   Bazemore said workers are instructed every day to remove tags
from hundreds of chickens condemned for diseases such as tumors and
green growths on their intestines. Chicken parts are sometimes
removed from a filthy floor drain and thrown back on the line, she
said.
   At Perdue, she said, workers were told that if they spoke to
reporters or the USDA, they would be fired. Bazemore is now an
organizer with the Center for Women's Economic Alternatives, a
support group for workers in the poultry industry.
   Perdue Farms, with headquarters in Salisbury, Md., responded by
issuing a press release calling Bazemore ``less than a model
employee.''
   ``The only way to respond to such outrageous allegations is to
invite members of Congress and the media to directly contact
government officials at (the U.S. Department of Agriculture) and
(the Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and ask them if
they would allow any poultry plant to function under the conditions
Ms. Bazemore described,'' Thomas R. Moyers, Perdue's vice president
of human resources, said in a statement.
   After Devine finished reading from Bazemore's testimony, Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J., expressed disbelief, asking where inspectors
from the Agriculture Department and the state are?
   Devine said they are present but cannot oversee the entire plant
all the time.
   ``What Ms. Bazemore has described are gross violations that
would be visually apparent to anyone at the plant,'' Roukema said,
suggesting that Bazemore should be called back before the
subcommittee and placed under oath.
   ``If these allegations are true, we have much more than just a
whistleblower problem,'' she said, adding that this matter would be
referred to the appropriate congressional committee, as well as to
the Agriculture Department.
   Robert P. Davis, the Labor Department's solicitor, told the
panel his agency opposes the whistleblower legislation, adding that
other such laws already exist.
   ``We are concerned that a generic approach to whistleblower
protection, although it is an attractive goal, could result in some
unnecessary or inappropriate federal coverage,'' Davis said,
   Legislation could be enacted to eliminate gaps in the existing
laws, he said, but ``such gaps should be identified and explicitly
covered by any new legislation.''

   Sony Corp. got leading Hollywood producers
Peter Guber and Jon Peters for its newly-aquired Columbia Pictures
on Thursday by settling a dispute with Warner Bros. Inc. in a pact
that includes joint business arrangements.
   The settlement ends all litigation stemming from Guber's and
Peters' acceptance of Sony's employment offer, according to an
announcement from New York by Warner, Sony USA and The Guber-Peters
Entertainment Co.
   Guber and Peters were producers of the highly acclaimed and
box-office hit movies ``Batman'' and ``Rain Man.''
   ``We're excited about the opportunity,'' Guber said in an
interview. ``It's something we dreamed and planned for all our
lives.''
   ``Over the next 120 days our agenda is to meet everybody ... and
to develop our relationship,'' Peters said, calling the deal a
``win-win'' situation for both sides with no animosity. ``We've
left as friends.''
   Warner has committed or invested $13 million in 50 projects
under development by the pair. The settlement included Warner
retaining rights to all unreleased Guber-Peters projects, including
sequels to ``Batman.''
   The settlement, which had been tentatively reported two weeks
ago, was signed in New York by Steven J. Ross, co-chairman of Time
Warner Inc., and Akio Morita, chairman of Sony Corp.
   Asked if there had been a significant hitch that kept the
settlement from being finalized for two weeks, Guber said it was
simply ``the process.''
   ``This transaction held a lot of importance to us and we wanted
to go about it carefully,'' he said.
   Sony Vice Chairman Michael T. Schulhof, who flew to Los Angeles
after the settlement was announced, said, ``We've gotten things
that we think are important to us. On balance, both companies have
done very well.''
   Schulhof would not put a value on the deal.
   In a statement, Ross said, ``The joint arrangements we have
worked out add significantly to Time Warner's worldwide position in
the media industry and help us achieve longstanding strategic
objectives on a global basis.''
   Morita said that Sony believes ``our agreements represent
excellent opportunities for all of us.''
   ``I think out of this you might get a win-win situation for both
parties,'' said Paul Marsh, an analyst with Bateman Eichler Hill
Richards Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Warner avoided getting bogged down in an expensive lawsuit and,
through the joint business agreements, will see profits flowing
back to them.
   ``They were smart enough to say `let's settle and get on with
things,''' Marsh said.
   Sony agreed in September to buy Columbia for $3.4 billion. The
dispute with Warner arose when Sony said it wanted to hire away
Guber and Peters.
   The settlement announcement said that some details would remain
confidential but it did confirm some points.
   Columbia Pictures will sell Warner its 35 percent interest in
The Burbank Studios and ranch, making Warner again the sole owner
of the 144-acre Southern California property. Warner previously
owned the entire facility during its heyday.
   Columbia Pictures will purchase Lorimar Studios in Culver City,
Calif. _ the former MGM lot _ from Warner Bros., which will give
Columbia ownership of its own studio facility.
   Warner and Columbia also agreed to a basic cable distribution
agreement for Columbia theatrical movie releases,
made-for-television movies and mini-series in the United States.
   Warner will also purchase a 50 percent interest in the Sony CBS
Records' subsidiary Columbia House, which is the largest
direct-marketer of records, tapes and videocassettes in the United
States. The announcement said Warner will continue its nonexclusive
distribution agreement with Columbia House and other clubs.
