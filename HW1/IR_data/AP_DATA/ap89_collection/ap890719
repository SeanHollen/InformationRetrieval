   Armed soldiers scattered hundreds of
students and beat and herded some into trucks as the military
government thwarted a planned mass opposition rally in Rangoon
Wednesday, witnesses said.
   It was not immediately known whether anyone was injured.
   Opposition leaders canceled the rally after the government put up
barricades throughout the capital and sent large numbers of troops
into the streets with harsh new martial law powers, sources said.
   Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi had said she would lead
thousands in a rally to mark Martyrs Day, which commemorates the
1947 assassination of her father and other independence leaders.
   She said in a telephone interview from Bangkok that she canceled
it to avoid bloodshed.
   The soldiers ``blocked off all the roads and prepared literally a
killing field for the people,'' said Ms. Suu Kyi, general secretary
of the National League for Democracy.
   Word of the cancelation apparently did not reach students who
marched toward the Martyrs Mausoleum carrying wreaths they intended
to lay there.
   Ms. Suu Kyi said soldiers used sticks to beat some of about 3,000
students in the capital's Swegondine district.
   A Western diplomat said he saw an army patrol scatter two groups
of students, one of several hundred and another of more than 1,000,
near the Shwedagon Pagoda, the city's Buddhist temple.
   ``About 25 to 30 soldiers advanced in line across the road, some
had bayonets leveled at the crowd ... others had grenade
launchers,'' he said by telephone.
   Soldiers pursued students down a side street, dragged some of
them out and hit them a few times with batons, he said.
   ``I saw about 15 or 20 picked up and put in a truck,'' he said.
   The others fled, littering the streets with wreaths, he said.
   There also were reports of clashes between soldiers and students
near the School of Fine Arts in the Bahan district, about half a
mile from the mausoleum.
   A heavily-guarded ceremony sponsored by the government was held
at the mausoleum in the morning, although it was boycotted by most
opposition parties.
   Downtown streets were largely empty in the afternoon as many
people stayed indoors, apparently fearing a clash between the
opposition and the military.
   Troops toting automatic rifles patrolled most intersections,
where there was little traffic and people ran to hide when military
vehicles passed.
   All day, the state radio repeated new regulations issued Tuesday
that include death penalties for those violating martial law.
Unauthorized gatherings of more than five people have been banned
under martial law.
   Martyrs Day, a public holiday, commemorates Burmese leaders who
were assassinated the year before Burma gained independence from
Britain. Most prominent of the martyrs was Suu Kyi's father, Aung
San.
   Ms. Suu Kyi said: ``Martial law is in full swing now. It is what
they have always wanted.
   ``They knew perfectly well that people wanted this to be a
perfectly peaceful ceremony, but they have used this day as an
excuse to impose martial law,'' she said. ``Their rule is based on
intimidation _ they don't have any other way of running the
country.''
   Ms. Suu Kyi is the most strident critic of military rule since
she emerged at the head of last year's uprising for democracy.
   The army killed thousands of unarmed demonstrators over several
months before army commander Gen. Saw Maung seized power, killing
hundreds more demonstrators to re-establish control in September.
   The pace of dissent has quickened in the past month, with Ms. Suu
Kyi drawing large crowds to her rallies.

   About 100 Shining Path guerrillas attacked
a private fish hatchery in the Andes, blowing up laboratories and
incubation tanks and killing 50 tons of trout, police said.
   Guerrillas in three trucks and a microbus arrived at the hatchery
Monday, tied up seven employees and set dynamite charges around the
facility, which is 25 miles northeast of Huancayo and 165 miles from
Lima.
   Authorities said the rebels made off with some arms, radio
equipment and a pickup truck. Security forces left Huancayo Tuesday
to pursue the rebels.
   The Shining Path is a fanatical, Mao-inspired guerrilla group
that has waged an armed insurgency against Peru's elected government
since 1980.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the
guerrilla war, including police, soldiers, government officials,
rebels and civilians.

<UNK>Law Reforms On the Way in England</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's top law officer pledged Wednesday to
press ahead with reforms of the legal system, despite fierce
opposition from most judges, barristers and even the attorney
general.
   Lord Mackay, lord high chancellor, presented his final propoals
in a policy document called a white paper, which Parliament will
debate.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher appointed Mackay to the Cabinet
post in 1987 and told him to propose reforms to do away with
restrictive legal practices. Britains' legal system has been
criticized for years as expensive and inaccessible to those who
cannot afford high fees.
   Mackay's proposals probably will become law since Mrs. Thatcher's
government has a 100-seat majority in the 650-seat House of Commons.
   Mackay made some concessions in the white paper but kept most of
his original proposals, including ending the monopoly that
barristers have on arguing cases in court. He would open that
practice to solicitors, who now are confined to consulting with
clients.
   Solicitors and barristers charge for their cases, even if they
lose. Mackay has proposed that lawyers in civil cases be paid only
if they win a case.
   As a concession, he said a proposed committee on conduct would
not be empowered to decide the rules governing the legal profession
but would have an advisory role. Instead, Mackay proposed that he
and senior judges decide any changes in the rules.
   ``The government's aim in all these changes is to make the legal
system of this country more straightforward, more flexible, and
above all more responsive to the citizen's choices and needs, whilst
at the same time maintaining the standards necessary to achieve
justice,'' he wrote in the white paper.
   In the past six months of debate over the proposals, judges
threatened to halt court work, although they eventually backed down,
and barristers launched a national campaign of denunciation.
   Attorney General Sir Patrick Mayhew said he would consider
resigning, although he didn't.
   David Tench, legal chief of the Consumers' Association, said Lord
Mackay's proposals would be a ``fundamental step in the right
direction toward a better, more responsive legal profession.''

   Here are day-to-day highlights of
events on the Apollo 11 moon flight 20 years ago this week:
   
   Saturday, July 19, 1969:
   Apollo 11 raced into the shadow of the moon and the astronauts
reported a spectacular first sighting of their destination.
Armstrong described a brilliant solar corona as the moon eclipsed
all but the halo of gases surrounding the sun. ``It looks like an
eerie sight,'' he reported.
   The spaceship slipped behind the backside of the moon, and
Collins fired the main engine for 5 minutes, 57 seconds to slow
their speed from 5,465 mph to 3,726 mph, settling into an orbit
ranging from 70 to 196 miles above the surface. Later, they
triggered the engine again to achieve a more circular path with a
low point of 62 miles and high point of 75 miles.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sunday, July 20, 1969:
   Armstrong and Aldrin entered the lunar module Eagle, and after
checking its systems, they cast off from Columbia. They fired the
craft's engine to start the descent to the moon. As they neared the
surface, they had to overcome computer alarms and had to fly around
a boulder field with fuel running low. But Armstrong found a
relatively smooth spot and touched down on the Sea of Tranquillity
with just enough fuel for seven more seconds of flying.
   ``Houston, Tranquillity Base here. The Eagle has landed,''
commander Armstrong reported. The time was 4:17.42 p.m. EDT.
   At 10:56 p.m., Armstrong stepped off a landing leg ladder and
planted the first human footprint on the moon. Aldrin followed 18
minutes later, and for about two hours, with more than 500 million
people watching on Earth, they explored the surface, planted the
American flag, gathered 50 pounds of lunar rocks and soil and spoke
with President Nixon through a radio-telephone hookup.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Monday, July 21, 1969:
   Precisely 69 seconds after Collins and Columbia passed over
Tranquillity Base, Armstrong fired Eagle's ascent engine and it rose
swiftly off the moon after a stay of 21 hours, 37 minutes. ``The
Eagle is back in orbit,'' Armstrong radioed.
   For more than 3 hours, Armstrong and Aldrin flew a series of
tricky rendezvous maneuvers, closing in on Columbia. The two ships
linked up and Armstrong and Aldrin rejoined Collins in the command
ship, transferring their lunar booty. Eagle, no longer needed, was
jettisoned to orbit the moon for several weeks before lunar gravity
tugged it down to a crash landing.

<TEXT>
   Tuesday, July 22, 1969:
   Collins fired Columbia's main engine for 2 minutes, 29 seconds to
propel the ship out of lunar orbit and start a 60-hour trip back to
Earth. ``We've got you coming home,'' Mission Control radioed.
   Within hours, they left the influence of lunar gravity and were
firmly in the grip of Earth's gravity, accelerating toward home. A
short burst of the main engine set them on a precise course to land
two days later in the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii, where the
recovery carrier USS Hornet waited.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Wednesday, July 23, 1969:
   A final television show from Columbia highlighted an otherwise
quiet day as Columbia sped closer to Earth and the three astronauts
relaxed and monitored spacecraft systems. Armstrong showed viewers
two sealed boxes in which were packed precious bits of soil and rock
that he and Aldrin had collected on the moon. He explained the
samples were placed in containers in the vacuum of the moon and were
sealed to prevent possible contamination of the Earth.
   As the Earth got nearer, the astronauts yearned for home. ``No
matter where you travel, it's nice to get home,'' Aldrin said.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Thursday, July 24, 1969:
   Columbia flashed into Earth's atmosphere at 24,500 mph, gradually
slowing until three main parachutes opened and dropped the craft
into warm Polynesian waters southwest of Hawaii at 12:50 p.m. EDT, 8
days, 3 hours, 18 minutes after the historic moon journey began. The
astronauts landed nine miles from the recovery carrier USS Hornet.
President Nixon was on the deck of the carrier to greet the
astronauts even though he could not shake their hands.
   The moon travelers immediately went into an elaborate quarantine
routine in which they would remain for 16 days, to protect the Earth
from any possible contamination from moon germs. The president faced
the three men through a glass window in their isolation van below
decks, flanked by a Marine honor guard. ``As a result of what you
have done, the world has never been closer together,'' Nixon said.

   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed Tuesday in
anticipation of heavy surf from Hurricane Dalilia, and residents
were urged to stock up on emergency supplies, although the storm
appeared to turn away.
   At 2 p.m. HST Tuesday, the hurricane was 450 miles southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving slightly north of a westerly course
at 12 mph, the National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustained
wind speed was 75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that
speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.
   The weather service said it was too early to tell whether the
slight shift north portended a significant change in course or
whether it meant Dalilia had a ``wobbling eye,'' a fairly common
phenomenon among hurricanes.
   If the hurricane took a more northwesterly course, it would pass
closer to the southern coasts of the islands, the service said in a
statement.
   Earlier in the day, data provided by the crew of an Air Force
hurricane-hunting airplane indicated the hurricane's center was
slightly farther south than it was Monday, said Clarence Lee, head
of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here.
   If it continued on the track determined by the airplane, Dalilia
would pass 250 miles south of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the
Hawaiian chain, Wednesday morning, Lee said.
   Dalilia's rapid westerly movement had slowed by nearly half from
20 mph during a 24-hour period, he added.
   ``Dalilia's current location and apparent movement is a favorable
sign for Hawaii,'' Lee said. ``If the trend continues, the hurricane
may pass far south of the island chain and the only effect ... would
be an increase in surf along the southern coasts of the islands.''
   A tropical storm watch remained in effect for Hawaii Island,
meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were possible if Dalilia
moved farther north than expected.
   Hawaii Island residents were urged to stock up on batteries,
canned goods and other emergency supplies in case the storm veered
northward.
   A high surf advisory was issued for beaches along the south shore
of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the Hawaiian chain, in
anticipation of waves as high as 15 feet.
   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as a
precautionary measure,'' said Bruce Butts, a spokesman for Hawaii
County Civil Defense. ``The tides are pretty high. That will make
surf especially dangerous.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Proposes Taxus Yew as State Shrub for Massachusetts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawmaker says the state known to some detractors
as ``Taxachusetts'' needs an official shrub befitting its budget
woes: the taxus yew.
   Republican Rep. Peter Forman filed a bill Tuesday to add the
ornamental shrub common to the state to the list of official state
symbols.
   ``The name of this humble fir echoes the calls from the governor
(Democrat Michael S. Dukakis) and many elected Democrats _ taxes on
you, taxes for you, more taxes at every turn,'' said the House
minority whip.
   The Legislature's Democratic majority recently supported a $700
million temporary income tax increase. And if it agrees to Forman's
bill, the taxus yew could join such other symbols as the the
official state fish, cod; the official state beverage, cranberry
juice; and the official state dog, Boston Terrier.
   Forman, a Plymouth representative who has a taxus yew on his
Statehouse office desk, suggested the shrub might be planted at
major intersections across the state.
   ``In that way, people would be reminded of the recent fiscal
actions of the governor and the Democrats in the House and Senate
every time they drove by or every time they checked their pay
stubs,'' he said.
   A Dukakis aide responded by referring to Forman's attempts to
weaken the universal health care law.
   ``We expect Representative Forman to propose next week
legislation making the chain saw the official tool of the
commonwealth after what he did to health care coverage for the
working poor of this state,'' Dukakis spokesman Steve Crawford said.
   Crawford also said Forman should propose making ``pass-the-hat
the official sport of the commonwealth, considering the number of
times he has come to the administration looking for money for his
district.''

<HEAD>NBC's All-Star Game Gets Top Rating, But Fox Moves Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Major-league baseball's all-star game on NBC
scored with the most viewers and Fox used a couple of heavy hitters
to gain its first Sunday night victory over a major network in the
Nielsen ratings.
   For the week ended July 16, Fox Broadcasting edged ABC for third
place Sunday.
   The fledgling network's ``Married ... With Children'' moved up to
23rd place and ``America's Most Wanted'' was 29th. Both shows had a
21 percent share of the audience, the highest share level in Fox
history.
   The game was the lowest-rated all-star game ever in prime time.
It reflected the generally low ratings this year for all baseball
coverage.
   NBC's coverage of the game was closely followed by ABC's
``Roseanne'' in second place. Both were on Tuesday night, but
because of the game's early start they were in direct competition
only in the East.
   NBC was first on the A.C. Nielsen Co. chart with an average of
12. CBS followed with 8.9 and ABC with 8.6.
   The ratings are a percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes
in the United States with television. The share is the percentage of
sets in use.
   ``Totally Hidden Video,'' Fox's highest-rated premiere show last
week in 21st place, dropped to 34th although the rating was off less
than a point.
   Fox had replaced several segments of the hidden-camera show after
it learned actors had been used and fired the producer. Allen Funt
of ``Candid Camera'' filed suit on grounds that some of the stunts
were taken from his show.
   The week's Top 10: NBC's All-Star Baseball Game, ABC's
``Roseanne,'' NBC's ``Cheers,'' NBC's ``A Different World,'' NBC's
``The Cosby Show,'' NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and ABC's ``Wonder
Years,'' tied, NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' CBS' ``60 Minutes'' and CBS'
``Murder, She Wrote.''
   ABC was first among evening news show with a rating of 8.8. CBS
scored 8.6 and NBC 7.9.
   The lowest-rated show was NBC's ``Jim Henson Hour.''
   The bottom five among only the three major networks were: CBS'
``48 Hours,'' ABC's ``Incredible Sunday,'' CBS' ``Beauty and the
Beast,'' ABC's ``Have Faith'' and NBC's ``Jim Henson Hour.''

<HEAD>Judge Orders Computer Hacker To Prison Despite `Addiction'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer hacker characterized as a program
pirate obsessed with cracking secret access codes was sentenced
Tuesday to a year in federal prison and six months rehabilitation.
   U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer issued the prison sentence
after learning she could not place Kevin Mitnick in a
hospital-operated therapy program for what an expert witness called
Mitnick's ``impulse disorder.''
   The program is not under contract with the federal government,
said Grace Denton, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney.
   ``A federal sentence has to be served in a federal facility,''
she said.
   Mitnick, who has been incarcerated at the federal Metropolitan
Detention Center downtown for seven months, need only serve five
more months in prison, Ms. Denton said.
   Mitnick, 25, pleaded guilty in May to computer fraud and
possessing unauthorized long-distance telephone codes. He will spend
six months in a residential therapy program after serving his prison
term.
   The charges stemmed from his use of stolen MCI long-distance
codes to tap into computers and copy valuable programs from Digital
Equipment Corp.
   After his prison term, Mitnick will be under conditional release
for three years. Mitnick will not be able to possess any illegal or
unauthorized access to computers or telecommunications equipment,
and will not be allowed to associate with known hackers. Another
condition states that he must complete a rehabilitation program.
   During his six months in a halfway house, Mitnick will be allowed
to either go to work or to treatment programs during the day, but he
must return to the halfway house at night, Ms. Denton said. He can
still have a personal computer.
   At one time, federal authorities considered Mitnick dangerous
enough to restrict his telephone use in jail. But Mitnick later
cooperated with authorities and apologized in court for his actions,
promising never to repeat them.
   Harriet Rossetto, a licensed social worker, testified that
Mitnick suffers from an impulse disorder and that his illegal
computer activity boosted his self-esteem.
   ``This is a new and growing addiction,'' she said. ``There was no
greed involved. There was no sabotage involved.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Asperger said that Mitnick's
activities were ``something like climbing Mount Everest.''
   ``He did it because it's there,'' said Asperger.

   Social activist Dick Gregory has gone
nearly six weeks without food to draw attention to illegal drug use.
He says it is just the beginning.
   At a news conference Monday marking 40 days of not eating, he
said he may fast for a year depending on two conditions: his health
and his hunger.
   ``If I get hungry enough, I will eat,'' Gregory said.
   During his fast, he consumes water, fruit juice and a special
vitamin powder.
   Gregory has lost 33 pounds. The Rev. George Clements, a Chicago
priest who's fasting with Gregory, lost 39 pounds.
   ``I went 40 days and I'm hungry. I am eating,'' Clements said.
   Gregory has been in Shreveport since June 6, attempting to drive
drug dealers out of this northwestern Louisiana city of 200,000. He
has staged protests at head shops and camped out in a park often
used for drug deals.

   The Duke and Duchess of York's short stop ended
with eating popcorn in front of a New York diner, standing on a
Paris rooftop and visiting a seedy district of Rome.
   It was all part of an exposition of film sets depicting different
city scenes.
   Prince Andrew and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, who asked
to see the Cites-Cines (Cinema Cities) exposition at the Palais de
la Civilisation, walked around the realistic sets, stopping to watch
clips of films.
   The duke ``especially loved the Cafe Lumiere and the Charlie
Chaplin and Jerry Lewis films,'' said Palais spokesman Pierre Royer,
referring to the set of a Paris cafe. The royal couple is on a
13-day tour of Canada.
   The British tabloid press, meanwhile, latched onto an incident
Sunday when the couple were booed at the closing ceremonies of
Quebec City's Summer Festival. The tabloids said the duchess was
close to tears.
   A story published in the Sun, a London newspaper, was headlined:
``Fergie Near Tears as Frogs Boo Her.'' A competing paper, Today,
headlined its story: ``Tour Turns Sour as Fergie Booed by 10,000.''
   The incident drew only passing attention from the Canadian media
and was described by witnesses as a few dozen boos.

   It's a riches-to-rags story for Roseanne
Conner, the wise-cracking mom on ABC's hit comedy ``Roseanne.''
   The show's producers on Tuesday denied rumors that the Conners,
played by Roseanne Barr and John Goodman, would strike it rich in a
lottery. The rumor turned up in a supermarket tabloid.
   Instead, producers Tom Werner and Marcy Carsey told reporters
that Roseanne would be unemployed at the beginning of the new season.
   Roseanne quit her job at the factory during the past season's
last episode.
   ``We think it's a very fertile area, someone who's unemployed,
and the first few scripts we're dealing with that. Obviously, in a
family like this, you need two incomes, so pretty soon Roseanne
Conner is going to find a job,'' Werner said.
   Carsey said Roseanne might possibly get a more upscale job, but
he was unsure.

   The U.S. Customs Service sees gold in an
auction of one of 20 platinum records presented for David Bowie's
album ``Let's Dance.''
   Leroy Elfrank, a Customs official in Lawton, said Tuesday the
record, encased in frame and glass, was found as workers took
inventory of the items to be auctioned Aug. 10 in Jersey City, N.J.
   Elfrank said he doesn't know why Customs had the record or to
whom it belonged. The record could have been seized or abandoned or
perhaps was unreturnable because of a lost mailing label, Elfrank
said.
   He said his office took several measures to track the
authenticity of the item, including talking to record companies and
Bowie's management firm.
   He said the company, Isolar, told him 20 platinum records were
made and that it didn't know the owner. Isolar, however, wanted it.
   ``We told them they could come to the auction and buy it back. It
belongs to the government now,'' Elfrank said.

   Heather Anne McLeod, a Nevada beauty queen, is
competing against the clock to enter the Miss Teen USA pageant.
   National pageant officials disqualified the 18-year-old winner of
the Miss Nevada Teen pageant for competing in two state pageants in
the same year.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Foley on Tuesday declined to order Miss
Universe Inc. to immediately let her compete in the national contest
in San Bernardino, Calif., but he agreed to hear Miss McLeod's
lawsuit against the organization today.
   Time is short: the nationally televised Miss Teen USA pageant's
finals are next Tuesday.
   Foley said it appeared she had grounds to sue over her
disqualification.
   Ms. McLeod said the Nevada pageant application was vague and
didn't understand that she couldn't compete in the California
pageant earlier this year.
   But Kristina Pickering, an attorney representing Miss Universe
Inc., said Ms. McLeod knew the rules and intentionally violated them.
   ``I think it's up to the judge to decide what to do, but I feel
I've won the contest fairly,'' Ms. McLeod said. ``I'd like to do the
best I can for the state of Nevada.''

   There is no way Thomas Root's revolver
could have discharged accidentally when his plane crashed into
Bahamian waters after his dramatic autopilot flight last week, the
gun's manufacturer said Tuesday.
   ``Absolutely not. It can't happen,'' Dick Bachmann, Smith &amp;
Wesson vice president, said from Springfield, Mass. The gun's safety
mechanism would make such a firing impossible, he said.
   Federal investigators have said the 36-year-old attorney's claim
that he doesn't remember a gunshot is the major inconsistency in his
version of the flight of his single-engine Cessna, crash and rescue
at sea Thursday.
   Hollywood police Chief Richard Witt said the gunmaker's statement
is only part of mounting evidence that shows Root's version of
events wasn't possible.
   ``I knew from the beginning his story wasn't true,'' Witt told
the Associated Press Tuesday night.
   Witt said there was ``indisputable'' proof contradicting Root's
version that his gun kept in the plane's glove compartment was
accidentally cocked and went off during the crash.
   The position of the glove compartment and the nature of the gun
and its safety features make an accidental discharge on impact
impossible, Witt said.
   Witt, a veteran homicide investigator, said forensic evidence
from the hospital shows that Root's wound was at least four hours
old when he arrived at the hospital.
   That supports statements by U.S. Coast Guard surgeon James
Rahman, who said he believed Root must have been shot at least two
hours before he was rescued.
   ``All this would indicate that Mr. Root is being less than
truthful. He's been saying some things that are now ludicrous,''
Witt said. ``Nobody is going to know what really happened until he
starts to put away those things that are implausible and starts
talking about what's plausible.''
   Andrew Alston, National Transportation Safety Board investigator,
said earlier that investigators would talk to Smith &amp; Wesson to see
if the .32-caliber revolver could have discharged on its own.
   Bachmann said Smith &amp; Wesson officials reacted with ``disbelief''
to the accounts suggesting the gun fired accidentally.
   Root's relatives said they thought the revolver may have been
cocked accidentally before Root fell unconscious when he reached
into the glove compartment for a compact disc. The gun then
apparently fired, Root suggested, when the out-of-fuel plane smacked
into the water. He has stoutly denied that the wound to his abdomen
was self-inflicted.
   ``Whatever the circumstances of the particular situation, the
Smith &amp; Wesson double-action revolver will only fire a cartridge
when that trigger is pulled back and held to the rear,'' Bachmann
told The Associated Press. ``Suggestions that it could are
absolutely false.
   ``There's an automatic internal safety feature that is designed
into the lockwork. Unless the trigger is pulled to the rear and
held, there is no way the hammer nose can impact the primer of the
cartridge,'' Bachmann said.
   Officials at Hollywood's Memorial Hospital, where Root remained
in stable condition Tuesday, said his family declined to be
interviewed. Root hasn't responded to AP requests for interviews.
   The NTSB said Alston will have a news conference at the hospital
Wednesday to discuss its investigation.
   Root was bound from Washington to Rocky Mount, N.C., when he told
air traffic controllers he was having trouble breathing. Military
pilots who trailed the plane reported seeing the pilot slumped over
the controls.
   Hundreds of miles to the south, the plane ran out of fuel and
plunged into the sea near the Bahamas, and stunned rescuers pulled
Root alive from the water.
   The following day, it was revealed that Root had been shot.
   But since then, he has been dogged by questions about his
business dealings, possible financial problems and past
investigations including discovery of a mini-arsenal of weapons and
a five-gallon drum of ether in his Manassas, Va., airport locker in
April.
   Root, who lives in Alexandria, Va., has insisted he didn't
attempt suicide. He says he passed out, apparently because of carbon
monoxide intake, and doesn't remember anything else until awakening
to see water coming into his plane.

   Hollywood has produced hundreds of great
movies, yet which ones are the very best?
   Congress has created a blue-ribbon panel to answer the question,
and representatives of 13 film groups are meeting today at the
University of California, Los Angeles, to try to choose what they
deem the best 25 movies.
   The movies they select will be the first to come under the
protection of the National Film Preservation Act of 1988.
   Leading candidates are ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' ``Casablanca,''
``It's a Wonderful Life,'' ``The Best Years of Our Lives,''
``Citizen Kane'' and ``On the Waterfront.''
   The preservation act, signed into law last year, was drafted in
response to outcries about the practice of coloring old
black-and-white films.
   It stipulates that a panel of film experts select 25 titles
annually, which will be added to a national film register labeling
movies according to their cultural, historical and aesthetic
interest.
   ``This will not stop the tampering, but it will make public
knowledge that a film has been tampered with,'' said George Kirgo,
president of the Writers Guild of America and a preservation board
member.
   Congress did not forbid a movie copyright holder from editing
movies, or from using computers to add color to films.
   But the film preservation act requires that such movies must be
labeled as colored or altered ``without the participation of the
principal director, screenwriter, and other creators of the original
film.''
   ``All it will do is identify the films when they're tampered
with. The 25 films that we'll pick must be so identified in the
future,'' Kirgo said.
   In preliminary polling, 57 movies were nominated by at least two
of 13 members of the preservation board.
   The leader was ``The Grapes of Wrath'' with eight votes.
``Casablanca'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life'' drew seven votes each;
``The Best Years of Our Lives,'` ``Citizen Kane'' and ``On the
Waterfront'' received six votes each.
   Aside from the writers guild, members of the panel were named
from the Screen Actors Guild; the Directors Guild of America; the
National Society of Film Critics; the Motion Picture Association of
America; the UCLA film department; the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences; the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers; the American Film Institute; the National Association of
Broadcasters; the department of cinema studies at New York
University; The Society of Cinema Studies and The University Film
and Video Association.

<HEAD>Man Crashes Truck Into Lorimar Studios, Kills Himself</HEAD>

   A man drove his truck through a
Lorimar-Telepictures studios gate, torched the vehicle, fired
shotgun blasts at a wall and killed himself, police said.
   The man's identity and the motive for the rampage at the motion
picture and television production complex were not immediately
known, said police Capt. Tom Mahoney.
   There were no other injuries, said police Lt. Jerry Dalven.
   The incident began shortly after 5 p.m., when the driver, who was
alone, handed a security guard two canisters and told him, ``You
have five minutes to live.''
   The canisters later were found to contain toxic methyl bromide
gas, Officer Ed Henneberque said.
   The driver had asked for someone, said witness Kelly Hustis.
Police could not immediately confirm the report.
   ``The guy just busted through the gates,'' said Bill McCullum, a
Lorimar security guard on duty at the gate after the incident. ``All
I know is I could have been the one lying on the ground.''
   The man then parked his vehicle against the wall of a studio
building, and apparently set it afire with a can of pressurized
lubricant, Henneberque said.
   A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department bomb squad was called
to the scene after studio firefighters discovered what appeared to
be a hand grenade lying on a seat in the truck, the officer said.
   The man walked onto the lot brandishing a shotgun, said Dave
Stapf, a spokesman for the studio 10 miles west of downtown Los
Angeles. After firing about six shots at random, he killed himself,
officials said.
   Stapf said the man apparently was not a former employee.
   Last December, a man was charged with fatally shooting two
unarmed security guards in a similar rampage at Universal Studios.
   Nathan Trupp, 44, of Albuquerque, N.M., had been turned away from
a Universal Studios gate minutes earlier by the guards after he
demanded to see actor Michael Landon. He allegedly returned to open
fire on the guards without warning.
   Trupp pleaded innocent July 5 to murder and attempted murder
charges filed in the case after a judge reversed an earlier finding
that Trupp was mentally incompetent to stand trial.

   A man who held various family members hostage
over the past 20 years kept police at bay for six hours Tuesday,
then shot and killed his daughter before turning the gun on himself,
authorities said.
   Suffolk County Police found the bodies of James Hyames, 59, and
his daughter, Lisa, 18, inside the family's Long Island home, said
Suffolk County Police Officer Salvatore Yovino.
   Hyames had been arguing with his daughter because she moved in
with her boyfriend and had recently sold her car, police said.
   Hyames also took family members hostage 20 years ago in Colorado
and in 1974 in Carlstadt, N.J., but did not kill any of them,
officials said.
   Hyames' wife walked out of their house during the argument
Tuesday, heard a shot, returned and saw Lisa Hyames lying on the
floor, said police Lt. William Kiley. She went to a neighbor's home
and called police.
   Carol Ianelli, another daughter of Hyames, said her father told
her on the telephone, ``I shot Lisa and she's lying in a pool of
blood.''
   When officers first approached the house, Hyames fired at them
with a handgun and drove them off. They waited two hours before
approaching again, but Hyames fired, grazing an officer's head,
Yovino said.
   Police surrounded the home and tried by telephone to persuade
Hyames to let them take Lisa out.
   Authorities connected Hyames' phone with that of his grown son,
Mark, in Harrisburg, Pa., in an effort to talk him into giving
himself up.
   At the end of the conversation, Hyames said ``goodbye,'' hung up
and a shot rang out, police said.
   With officers were several of Hyames' relatives, including
Ianelli, who said she hadn't spoken to her father in 15 years.
   Carlstadt Deputy Police Chief John Occhiuzzo, who along with a
priest talked Hyames into surrendering in 1974, was brought to the
scene Tuesday to try and help bring him out again, said Officer
Randy Jared.
   No one was hurt in the Carlstadt incident, in which Hyames held
his wife and two children hostage for 19 hours, but he served time
in jail, according to Carlstadt police Lt. Herb Scheidewig.
   Suffolk police had no information on the Colorado incident.
   The officer grazed with a bullet Tuesday was not seriously hurt.

   Archaeologists using shovels and other
garden tools found a human skull bone Tuesday underneath a marker
honoring the five men believed to be victims of 19th-century
cannibal Alferd Packer.
   ``It's definitely human,'' said archaeologist Jim Ayres as the
bone was unearthed in the apparent grave at noon.
   Walter Birkby, a physical anthropologist at Arizona State Museum
in Tucson, said it was a left temporal bone found in the human
skull. It will be shipped to the University of Arizona for analysis.
   The archaeologists are participating in a dig organized by George
Washington University law professor James Starrs, who wants to learn
the truth about the 1874 cannibalism case. He hopes to determine how
the five men were murdered and whether Packer consumed their remains.
   Packer formed a party of Utah men to search for gold in the San
Juan Mountains, but the group became snowbound on the 9,000-foot
mountain ridge in 1874.
   Packer claimed that one of the men, Shannon Bell, killed the
other four while Packer was away from camp. Packer said he then
killed Bell in self-defense and consumed the remains of the five men
to survive.
   Despite his claim, Packer was convicted of murdering one of the
prospectors in 1883. After that verdict was overturned by the state
Supreme Court, Packer was retried and convicted of manslaughter. He
was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison, but was paroled in 1901
and died six years later.
   The reputed gravesite of the five victims has been set off by a
marker, which honors the five men ``who were murdered on this spot
early in the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources of the
San Juan country.'' But researchers are uncertain whether the sign
marks the actual spot where Packer victims are buried.
   Working in short-sleeved shirts, hiking shorts and hats, Ayres,
Birkby and some of their graduate students dug about 6 inches under
the marker Tuesday before locating parallel rows of rock that they
speculated marked the graves of the five men. The human bone was
found a short time later.
   Ayres said the group had a photograph of the rocks in formation
that was taken in 1909, but he and Birkby were cautious about what
may lie below the rocks.
   ``We'll clean it up, shoot it, plot it on the map and then dig
some more,'' Birkby said. ``We don't know how deep it is.''
   To this day, the Packer case has triggered broad human interest,
from embellished legend to jokes, and the wry amusement is shared by
scientists on the dig as well as the onlookers.
   Starrs has nicknamed the dig area ``the bone zone,'' and is
selling T-shirts bearing a skeleton and the words, ``Gimme Five, the
Alferd Packer Expedition July 1989'' to help offset the costs of the
trip.
   Other T-shirts for sale in the area proclaim, ``Have a Friend for
Dinner,'' and ``Alferd Packer, Serving His Fellow Man.''

<HEAD>Opposition Criticizes Roh's Cabinet Changes As Cosmetic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo replaced six
Cabinet ministers today and fired the head of the politically
powerful national intelligence agency.
   Opposition leaders immediately denounced the changes as cosmetic
and claimed Roh ignored the public's desire for a complete change to
rid the government of officials who served under former President
Chun Doo-hwan.
   Most ministers in the 23-member Cabinet worked in some capacity
under the discredited and authoritarian Chun government.
   The changes today involved the home, construction,
communications, political affairs, labor, and health and social
affairs ministries.
   They were not expected to alter government policies and were
widely seen as a political housekeeping move aimed at reassuring
citizens that the governing party is concerned about social unrest,
rising crime and welfare problems.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and the other 16 ministers were
retained. The last Cabinet shake-up was in December 1988, when Kang
and 19 ministers were appointed.
   In the most noticable change, former Attorney General Suh
Dong-kwon, 56, replaced Park Seh-jik as head of the powerful Agency
for National Security Planning, fomerly the Korean Central
Intelligence Agency.
   Park was better known to foreigners as chief organizer of the
successful 1988 Summer Olympic Games held in Seoul in September.
   The intelligence agency has been widely criticized for apparently
not knowing beforehand of secret visits to communist North Korea by
dissident clergyman Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, opposition lawmaker Suh
Kyong-won and a radical student leader still in the north.
   Under South Korean law, unauthorized visits to the north are
illegal.
   The largest opposition group, the Party for Peace and Democracy,
said Suh Dong-kwon was ``in the vanguard of the government's
suppression of political opposition and dissent'' as attorney
general under Chun.
   Lee Sang-soo, a party spokesman, said the Cabinet change
``ignored the people's ardent desires for further democratization
and liquidation of human rights abuses and corruption'' under Chun,
who left office in February 1988.
   Lee In-che, spokesman for the opposition Reunification Democratic
Party, said the changes were ``not adequate to satisfy the people's
anticipation of renovation in government.''
   He said the public demanded better law enforcement and handling
of the nation's economic problems.
   Roh was elected president in December 1987, winning 36.6 percent
of the vote as two other candidates split the opposition vote.
   In other changes today, National Assemblyman Kim Tae-ho of the
governing party was made home minister, succeeding Lee Han-dong.
Sources said Lee was dismissed to hold him responsible for a surge
in violent crime in recent months. Police are under the home
minister's control.
   Kwon Yong-gack, president of the state-run Korea Housing Corp.
and a retired army general, became construction minister.
   Former governing party lawmaker Kim Chong-in was made health and
social affairs minister, Communications Minister Choi Young-choul
was reassigned as labor minister and former President Lee Woo-chae
of the state-run Korea Telecommunications Authority, took over
Choi's old post.
   Park Chul-un became the first minister of state for political
affairs. Park previously was a special presidential assistant on
policy matters.

<HEAD>Geologist Disputes Odds of Eruption at Nevada Dump Site</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is underestimating the
chances of a volcanic eruption near a Nevada site proposed to entomb
high-level nuclear waste that will remain radioactive for 10,000
years, a senior government geologist says.
   Department officials say the analysis by John Trapp, a staff
geologist at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is flawed. But they
acknowledged Tuesday that more study is needed before determining
whether the site can be used.
   Trapp, in what he called preliminary calculations, said his
review of the Yucca Mountain site and assessments by Energy
Department scientists show the chances of an eruption in the area
during the next 10,000 years are about one in six, not the one in 30
odds suggested in department studies.
   The proposed site is about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Trapp made the assertion in an internal memorandum June 22 to
Philip Justus, head of the NRC's geology section.
   Copies of the memo were released Tuesday by members of the Nevada
congressional delegation opposed to building the repository. The
state government also strongly opposes the project and has refused
to grant the permits the Energy Department needs to begin assessing
the site's suitability.
   John J. Linehah, a senior NRC licensing official, sent a copy of
the Trapp analysis on July 11 to Energy Department and Nevada state
officials. In a cover letter he called it ``a simple example'' of
the kinds of issues that need to be resolved by the Energy
Department before it seeks a license for the waste dump.
   Joseph Fouchard, an NRC spokesman, said Trapp's view did not
represent the NRC's official position, but he said, ``We agree with
Trapp's conclusion that it's an issue that has to be faced up to
early.''
   Yucca Mountain is adjacent to the Nevada Test Site where the
Energy Department conducts underground nuclear explosions. It would
permanently store nuclear waste from commercial nuclear power plants.
   The NRC, which would be responsible for licensing the dump, is
analyzing the Energy Department's approach to assessing Yucca
Mountain's suitability.
   Members of the NRC and the commission's staff said last week they
believe the Energy Department needs to put more emphasis on
resolving quickly such issues that could make or break Yucca
Mountain as a tomb for the nuclear waste.
   Congress decreed in 1987 that only Yucca Mountain should be
considered as a home for the waste.
   Carl Gertz, the Energy Department manager of the Yucca Mountain
project, said in a telephone interview he agreed the volcano issue
needed to be studied more. But he called Trapp's method of
calculating the odds of an eruption ``unrealistic.''
   Trapp wrote that because of various flaws in assessments made by
B.M. Crowe, a Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist assigned to
the Yucca Mountain project, ``the numbers which were generated by
Crowe could be highly in error.''
   Crowe's work on volcanism at Yucca Mountain is considered the
most complete so far.
   Trapp said that although his analysis was ``preliminary and for
illustrative purposes only,'' he concluded ``the various
probabilities and consequences which have been used for volcanic
disruption of a repository at Yucca Mountain may be in error by
several orders of magnitude.''

   Organization of American States foreign
ministers are meeting again with deep divisions remaining over how
much pressure they should bring to bear on Panamanian leader Manuel
Antonio Noriega to surrender power.
   As the OAS prepared to meet today, the State Department was
expressing deep disappointment over the lack of enthusiasm among
many delegates for taking decisive action against Noriega.
   These delegates, led by Mexico, cite provisions protecting member
nations against outside intervention. They also see the problem
concerning Noriega as essentially a U.S.-Panamanian issue, not one
which should involve the OAS.
   But the Bush administration has become increasingly impatient
with what it regards as foot dragging by the 31-member OAS. U.S.
officials, insisting on anonymity, said early drafts of a speech
prepared for Secretary of State James A. Baker III for today's
meeting were sharply worded.
   Baker was returning to his office today after his two-week trip
to Europe with President Bush and it was not clear beforehand
whether he or a subordinate would represent the United States at the
meeting.
   As Baker sees it, the administration bowed to Latin wishes by
assuming a low profile in the Panamanian situation and giving the
OAS a chance to forge a solution, the U.S. officials said.
   The Latin Americans had contended the Reagan administration too
often had acted unilaterally in confronting hemispheric problems and
that a multi-lateral approach was far preferable.
   But U.S. officials complain the OAS has shown no stomach for
acting decisively against Noriega, who is under indictment in
Florida on drug smuggling charges.
   Anti-Noriega sentiment in the OAS grew last May after Panamanian
authorities threw out the results of the May 7 national elections
amid widespread allegations that the candidate opposed to Noriega
was the landslide winner. The opposition presidential and vice
presidential candidate were beaten by pro-Noriega forces when they
tried to stage a public rally.
   The OAS met in emergency session May 17 and appointed a team of
mediators to go to Panama with a mandate to achieve a democratic
``transfer of power'' in Panama.
   One deadline for achieving that objective passed on June 6 and a
second deadline was set for today.
   The OAS mediators are more optimistic than the State Department
about a settlement, pointing to two meetings in recent days between
Panamanian opposition and government leaders.
   U.S. officials viewed those meetings as an attempt by Noriega to
dampen still further whatever desire the OAS may still have for
involvement in the Panama question.
   The Panamanian government hoped today's meeting would end with no
extension of the mediators' mandate.
   Expressions of impatience with the OAS already are being heard
from lawmakers as ideologically diverse as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. There is even a movement in the
Senate to leave vacant for an extended period the post of U.S.
ambassador to the OAS.
   Meetings among the Latin delegates were held Tuesday at the
Colombian Embassy and elsewhere in an attempt to reach a consensus
on the Panamanian problem.
   With the results of the May 7 election nullified and with no
announced winner, it is not clear what will happen in Panama on
September 1, the date on which the Panamanian constitution says a
new president is to take office.

<HEAD>GOP Lawmakers File Suit Against Bush Over Contra Aid Compromise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A White House agreement giving top
congressional leaders the power to stop Contra aid later this year
is unconstitutional, four conservative GOP lawmakers charge in a
lawsuit against President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   Meanwhile, some lawmakers Tuesday hailed Bush administration
plans to cut separate aid to the Contras' political operations as a
gesture of bipartisan cooperation and a move toward getting the
rebels to return home.
   Congressional leaders and Contra spokesmen confirmed that funding
for the Miami office will be sharply reduced. In Miami, Jorge
Rosales, a Contra spokesman, said it could mean the closing of the
office.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress passed a $50 million package
of non-military aid for the Nicaraguan rebels in April, but only
after the administration agreed to cut off aid by Nov. 30 if eight
Senate and House leaders do not approve its continuation through
February.
   In a lawsuit filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court, the pro-Contra
lawmakers said the bipartisan agreement sets a dangerous precedent
and violates the Constitution by circumventing the congressional
process.
   ``To allow one congressman or senator out of 535 to deny
implementing a law passed by Congress and supported by the president
is clearly unconstitutional,'' said Rep. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H. He
said the ``side agreement'' gives the six Democratic and two
Republican congressional leaders ``super veto power.''
   Also joining the suit were Rep. Phil Crane, R-Ill., and Rep.
Chuck Douglas, R-N.H.
   The funding for the Miami Contra office does not come out of the
Contra aid package approved by Congress in April.
   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said the Miami office will be
moved to an undisclosed location in Central America and added: ``We
are increasing our activities.'' The decision does not affect the
Contras' office in Washington.
   Jason Isaacson, spokesman for Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
described the cuts as ``good news,'' and said it showed the Bush
administration was following up on its agreement with Congress last
spring to seek ways for the rebels to return to Nicaragua.
   Rep. Robert Dornan, R-Calif., however, described the proposal as
``an absolute tragedy.''

   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich is
enlisting a former colleague as he prepares to defend a
controversial book deal even before an ethics committee vote to
formally investigate him, according to GOP sources.
   The sources, speaking only on condition they not be named, said
Tuesday that Gingrich has asked former Rep. Ed Bethune, R-Ark. for
assistance as he awaits for a likely ethics panel vote Thursday to
launch a preliminary inquiry.
   Bethune, now a Washington attorney, would not discuss any
conversations he had with Gingrich.
   Gingrich, who triggered the investigation that brought down
former House Speaker Jim Wright, was accused in a complaint by Rep.
Bill Alexander, D-Ark., of possibly violating federal campaign
finance laws and House rules on gifts and outside income.
   The allegations focused on a partnership Gingrich formed, in
which 21 investors gave $5,000 each to promote ``Window of
Opportunity,'' a book written by the Georgia Republican, his wife
and a third author.
   Gingrich saw his House fortunes rise over the past year as those
of Wright, D-Texas, fell, because it was Gingrich who filed the
original ethics complaint against the Texas Democrat.
   The Gingrich investigation seemed a near-certainty after Chicago
lawyer Richard J. Phelan, who conducted the committee's probe of
Wright, acknowledged he's been contacted by the panel about handling
an investigation of Gingrich.
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel, of Illinois, said Gingrich
may also be ``thinking of contacting'' other former members for help.
   If the committee votes to start a preliminary inquiry, Gingrich
would need a legal team quickly, because he would have the right to
give the panel a statement defending himself against the allegations.
   Michel also said the investigation can become ``a pretty
expensive thing'' for the Georgia Republican.
   Gingrich wouldn't discuss the probe Tuesday, but when he was
asked if expected it to cost him a of money, said ``yes.'' He said
he would have more to say Thursday.
   Wright primarily financed his legal defense out of campaign
funds, but also established a separate legal defense fund which was
not subject to limits that apply to campaign donors.
   The ex-speaker had almost $500,000 in legal bills, supporters
said in mid-May this year, and that figure would have climbed
considerably if Wright had continued to defend himself in a trial
phase of the ethics investigation.
   The panel had accused Wright of 69 rules violations, including
some of the same charges that Alexander leveled against Gingrich:
violating outside income limits and keeping gifts from persons with
a direct interest in legislation.

<HEAD>Congress Leaves Dye in FDA's Hands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-nine years after calling for a study of
whether Red Dye No. 3 causes cancer, the House says the government
still needs to find out more about the substance.
   But a congressman said the Food and Drug Administration can ban
the substance without further delay if it wants to.
   The vote by the House Tuesday approving the $42.1 billion
agriculture appropriations bill included a provision calling for
more study of the dye, but left unresolved whether the dye that
gives maraschino cherries their distinctive red glow would be pulled
from the market.
   In 1960, when Congress called for a ban on foods that cause
cancer in laboratory animals, Red Dye No. 3 was put on a provisional
list that allowed it to stay on the market for additional study.
   ``It was supposed to last for 2{ years, during which time the
industries were supposed to test the dyes for safety,'' said Rep.
Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., calling for immediate removal of the chemical.
   ``The industry has had 29 years to test these dyes,'' he said.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young has maintained the substance does
not pose a health threat to humans, and the Wall Street Journal
reported Tuesday that his office worked with canners and growers on
the language to postpone action.
   Large doses of the additive have caused tumors in rats, leading
consumer groups to demand that it be banned.
   Weiss complained about the language in the Appropriations
Committee's report on the bill that said the FDA should perform a
``long-term study'' on the dye. Although such language is not a
formal part of the law, it is used by agencies for guidance on
congressional intentions.
   The report said the study should be reviewed by the FDA ``prior
to making any decision relating to changes in the provisionally or
permanently approved uses of this color.''
   But Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee, said it's up to the FDA commissioner to
decide whether Red Dye No. 3 will stay on the shelves.
   Weiss said the agency shouldn't wait any longer.
   ``Under the law, the FDA has no option but to follow through with
its stated intentions to terminate the provisional listing of Red
Dye No. 3,'' said Weiss. ``It is high time that it do so.''
   Weiss, chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee
on human resources and intergovernmental relations, asked the FDA
Tuesday to provide all of its documents relating to the regulatory
status of Red Dye No. 3 over the past year.
   The appropriations bill covers spending for all agriculture
programs, as well as rural development programs like the Farmers
Home Administration, Rural Development Insurance Fund and Rural
Electrification Administration.

   President Bush went to Eastern and Western
Europe with an open checkbook, but not with carte blanche to
accommodate the many countries and causes tugging at his sleeve.
   In fact, he left disappointed people everywhere _ in Warsaw, at
the headquarters of the Solidarity trade union in Gdansk, at the
seven-nation economic summit in Paris, and even in the Dutch capital
of The Hague.
   ``Everybody wants the United States to pick up the check for
everything,'' Bush grumbled as he returned home Tuesday from the
9,000-mile journey.
   He said a group of Dutch legislators he met with wanted U.S.
funding for international environmental cleanup programs. They all
assume ``we are rolling in money,'' and at the same time foreign
leaders are asking the United States to balance its budget, he said.
   ``They understand we are not rolling in money because of our
deficit,'' he said, returning home only hours after his
administration issued its semi-annual economic prediction
forecasting slower growth and higher interest rates than earlier
projections.
   However, it said the federal budget deficit will be lower this
year than was expected _ $148.3 billion, down sharply from the $164
billion predicted in February.
   From the start, the administration sought to play down hopes of
U.S. munificence in Europe.
   ``This is really not a trip to bestow economic largess,''
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said on Bush's first day in
Poland.
   In fact, the aid package Bush unveiled in the Polish parliament
was a drop in the bucket of Poland's urgent needs.
   Bush promised to ask Congress for $100 million to help private
entrepreneurs and $15 million to fight pollution in the city of
Krakow.
   He also pledged to ask U.S. allies to increase their aid to
Poland _ which he did later that week in Paris _ and to encourage
the World Bank to provide $325 million in loans for Polish
agriculture and industry.
   But the Polish government wrote to the seven-nation Paris summit,
asking for $4.3 billion in loans and debt relief.
   In the Baltic Sea port of Gdansk, Solidarity chief Lech Walesa
invited the Bushes to his home for lunch _ and asked for $10 billion
to help Poland. The next day, the Solidarity daily newspaper said
Bush's gift ``disappointed many people'' although it praised the
warm intentions it reflected.
   In Hungary, Bush promised $25 million to encourage private
enterprise and 60 American Peace Corps volunteers to teach English.
   On to Paris, where Bush encountered an embarrassing situation:
leaders of some two dozen developing nations were invited by
left-leaning French President Francois Mitterrand to participate in
the bicentennial parties of the French Revolution and to mingle with
their richer counterparts.
   The Third World group called for an urgent dialogue between
developed and developing nations to discuss economic and
environmental programs. But the United States and England rebuffed
the suggestion, and Mitterrand promised to support it _ at a later
date.
   The solution to the problems of the Third World countries,
advised Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, was on a case-by-case
basis.
   Based on that approach, the United States sought to encourage a
conclusion to negotiations between Mexico and its commercial bankers
for a plan to ease the $100 billion Mexican debt. Those talks are
going on in New York.
   In fact, Bush and the other leaders _ of Britain, France, West
Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _ issued a communique at the end of
their annual gathering sternly admonishing private banks to be more
realistic in their expectations from Third World debtors and to cut
their debts.
   On the environment too, the United States and its partners were
big on words but light on cash. They called for concerted efforts to
clean up the seas and oceans and preserve the eroding ozone layer
that protects the earth from harmful sun radiation, but did not
commit any money.
   Only one group of nations got relief. Bush promised, just prior
to leaving for Europe, that the United States will forgive $1
billion in debts owed by the earth's poorest lands _ those in
sub-Saharan Africa.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Veterans Affairs will have
new rules this fall instructing its panel of scientific advisers to
take a more generous look at studies linking Agent Orange exposure
and a variety of ailments.
   The new rules could make it more likely for the 35,000 Vietnam
veterans who have filed claims based on exposure to the
dioxin-containing defoliant to receive compensation.
   More than 225,000 veterans have received VA physical examinations
out of concern for Agent Orange exposure. So far, only five have
received benefits.
   Rather than looking for proof that dioxin exposure and caused
disease, miscarriages or birth defects, VA's Advisory Committee on
Environmental Hazards need only look for a ``significant statistical
association'' between disease and exposure, under the regulations
proposed Tuesday.
   The committee evaluates data on radiation and dioxin exposure
which the VA uses to determine claims. The new criteria will apply
to radiation studies as well.
   Dioxin is recognized as one of the most toxic chemicals.
   Government scientists say they cannot prove troops other than the
1,200 Air Force personnel who directly took part in the spraying
operation were exposed. That group has yet to show any dramatic
increase in cancers, the government says.
   Outside studies, including one commissioned by the American
Legion, contend records of spraying and troop movements, combined
with questionnaires answered by veterans, show a connection. There
was no conclusion on cancer in the American Legion study because of
the nature of the study.
   The regulations, subject to public comment and final approval,
are expected to take effect Oct. 1.
   They were drafted after U.S. District Judge Thelton E. Henderson
of San Francisco ruled that the VA too strictly interpreted the 1984
Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Compensation Standards Act.
   Agent Orange, made by seven chemical companies, was contaminated
with dioxin during manufacture, the department says.
   A class-action lawsuit against manufacturers has been settled,
and veterans are receiving payments as a result, but the settlement
did not assign responsibility.

   Afghan rebels who hold Soviet prisoners may
also hold the key to releasing Americans held in Southeast Asia,
says a POW advocate.
   ``They have indicated a clear desire to help ... and they are in
a position to help,'' said William M. Hendon, from Asheville, N.C.,
back from his second meeting in Peshawar, Pakistan, with leaders of
the Mujahedeen.
   Hendon quoted one of the rebels as saying, ``The Soviets can get
your men out like that,'' adding a snap of the fingers. ``The world
knows they got your prisoners. We will help you get them out.''
   Hendon a former Republican member of the House and former
Pentagon consultant, heads the McLean, Va.,-based POW Publicity
Fund, created to publicize a $2.5 million reward offered by 21
congressmen for the return of a American prisoners of war they claim
have been held captive since the Vietnam War.
   Relatives of POWs accompanied Hendon for the second trip, from
which they returned Saturday. They have been lobbying members of
Congress and others for the plan and for continued military aid to
rebels fighting the communist-backed government in Kabul.
   ``They've lived what we've lived for many, many years because of
their own losses,'' said one of the relatives, Beth Bischoff of
Wilson, N.C.
   The State Department says it has received no reports from the
Mujahedeen about the possibility of a three-way prisoner deal.
   The United States says it is unable to prove the existence of
POWs in Vietnam although it won't rule out the possibility. There
are 2,348 Americans unaccounted for in Southeast Asia.
   The Soviets claim 300 of their number are held by the rebels.

<HEAD>Pentagon Payday Shift Triggering Savings Gimmicks in Congress</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congressional budget writers complain that the
Pentagon's decision to move its Oct. 1 payday up by two days is
triggering a rash of deficit-cutting gimmicks by House and Senate
committees.
   The Defense Department payday shift would move $2.9 billion in
salaries to the end of the 1989 fiscal year _ and allow the agency
to claim an equal amount in savings from its fiscal 1990 budget.
   Objections to the idea crescendoed on Tuesday, even as the Bush
administration conceded that the economy is not performing as
robustly as it expected several months ago.
   In May, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered the military's
monthly payday of Oct. 1 _ a Sunday _ moved up to Friday, Sept. 29,
saying the shift would avoid inconveniencing troops.
   But since fiscal 1990 begins Oct. 1, the rescheduling had the
effect of shifting $2.9 billion into the previous fiscal year,
freeing up $2.9 billion in 1990 for other purposes for the Pentagon.
   ``I think it has a budget consequence that was not intended by
the statute,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley told reporters Tuesday.
   Lawmakers grumbled that the payday shift enabled Cheney to claim
a solution to a dispute between the administration and Congress over
the Pentagon's budget, in which congressional budget officials were
claiming that the military will spend too much money next year.
   Now, congressional committees are mapping plans to achieve
similar budget savings by shifting paydays for civilian agencies
that they oversee.
   The House Appropriations Committee approved a spending bill
Monday that claims $358 million in savings by bumping ahead the Oct.
1 paydays for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Environmental
Protection Agency and NASA.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., told a
reporter Monday that committees controlling the Department of
Transportation and the Postal Service are planning similar shifts.
He and other congressional leaders are mapping plans to prevent the
idea from spreading.
   ``It'll set a powerful precedent,'' Rep. Bill Frenzel of
Minnesota, ranking Republican on the House Budget Committee, said
regarding the Pentagon payday shift. ``We'd be hard-pressed to say
the others can't do it if the one could do it.''
   Also Tuesday, the administration officially geared down the
economic projections it released in February.
   Administration officials estimated that short-term interest rates
would average 8 percent this year and drop to 6.7 percent next year,
that the economy would grow by 2.7 percent this year and 2.6 percent
next year, and that inflation would rise by 4.9 percent in 1989 and
4.1 percent in 1990.
   Each figure was more pessimistic than the administration forecast
in February _ estimates that at the time were called overly rosy by
congressional and outside economists.
   The administration projected that the fiscal 1990 deficit would
be $99.2 billion, well within the $110 billion shortfall target for
the year of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.

   American officials are stunned by the slaying
of 30 Afghan rebels, and they say the massacre may prompt an
evaluation of where U.S. military aid goes but is unlikely to result
in less assistance.
   ``It's kind of a mess ... I'm greatly concerned,'' said Rep.
David Dreier, R-Calif., a strong supporter of the mujahedeen, as the
anti-government rebels call themselves.
   Dreier said if reports that supporters of Gulbaddin Hekmatyar of
the Hezb-e-Islami group ambushed and killed their rivals are true,
``We have to be very careful not to have him as a ... recipient of
our arms.''
   He said the United States has ``always had problems with
Hekmatyar,'' who Dreier said holds anti-Western views.
   In Pakistan, Qaribur Rehman Saeed, a spokesman for Hekmatyar's
hard-line Islamic group, acknowledged the group killed some
competing fighters from the Jamiat-e-Islami guerrilla organization.
Saeed said his group is still investigating what happened July 9 in
the Takhar Valley.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said ``there may be''
some change in the distribution of aid, ``but at this point we don't
have any new details.''
   But, he said, ``The basic goal of supporting the mujahedeen,
urging them to unite, supporting their efforts of self-determination
_ that remains something we intend to continue pursuing.''
   There are seven major factions among the anti-government rebels,
with alliances sometimes shifting and some groups deeply opposed to
others.
   Boucher and others tried to play down the significance of the
internecine struggle.
   Asked why the United States would continue to aid a faction it
determined may have killed other rebels, Boucher responded: ``I
think what you're doing is taking one incident and blowing it out of
proportion.''
   He said, however, the United States deplored the incident, which
he labeled ``tragic'' and ``grave.''
   Another State Department official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, doubted U.S. assistance to the Mujahedeen would be
affected by the incident. That could change if such activities
become ``an endemic or pervasive problem,'' he said.
   Meantime, published reports quoted U.S. officials as saying they
have decided to increase military aid to the rebels in response to a
massive increase in Soviet military supply shipments to the Kabul
government.
   Although the Soviets withdrew their 115,000 troops from
Afghanistan in February as part an accord with the United States,
Moscow has been sending arms to the Kabul government at the rate of
$200 million to $300 million a month since March, a U.S. official
said.
   The Geneva accords called for an end to outside involvement in
Afghanistan.

<HEAD>Democrats Trying to Limit Political Ambassadorships</HEAD>

   Despite an initial defeat, Democratic critics
are pressing attempts to curb President Bush's nominations of large
numbers of political supporters and Republican contributors to
diplomatic posts.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and other Democrats said the quality
of the nation's representation abroad suffers when ambassadors and
senior State Department officials are chosen for their contributions
to the Republican Party, not for professional qualifications to
handle their jobs.
   Up to two-thirds of Bush's diplomatic nominations have been based
on political connections, a far higher percentage than in any recent
administration, Democrats contend.
   But Gore's bid to restrict political nominees to no more than 15
percent of the diplomatic corps was defeated Tuesday, 79-20.
   He readied a fall-back position, limiting such nominations to no
more than 30 percent, a total in keeping with administrations dating
back to that of President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s.
   Gore said he also will seek to rally opposition against nominees
whose non-political qualifications to represent the United States
abroad are thin.
   The Bush administration has submitted 42 diplomatic nominations,
of which 28 can be classified as political, Democrats said.
   They said many of them have few identifiable qualifications for
the jobs.
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and other senators contended the
proposed restriction would represent an unconstitutional intrusion
on the president's ability to conduct foreign policy.
   Gore said the political appointments destroy morale within the
U.S. Foreign Service and represent ``an abuse for which there is no
justification.''
   ``Other nations do not undermine their national interests
overseas to grant political favors or ensure loyalty to the
political line of the governing party,'' Gore said.
   In other action on pending State Department authorization bill,
the Democratic-controlled Senate approved an amendment forbidding a
president from soliciting foreign or private funds to carry out
foreign policy activities prohibited by Congress.
   The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
reflects lingering political fallout from the Iran-Contra affair.
   It was adopted, 57-42, after Moynihan contended it was an
essential step to make sure a president and his staff do not move to
circumvent the law.
   But Helms, voting on the losing side, protested the amendment
``is a clear, bald effort to usurp the foreign policy prerogatives
of the president of the United States in a manner not allowed by the
Constitution.''
   He predicted President Bush will veto the entire State Department
authorization bill because of it.
   The provision would make violators subject to fines and jail
terms of up to five years.
   Testimony before the congressional Iran-Contra committees showed
the Reagan administration solicited millions of dollars from
American citizens, and from such nations as Saudi Arabia and Brunei,
for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when U.S. aid them was banned by
Congress.
   ``This amendment can be summed up in three words: `Obey the
law,''' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Offers Changes in Catastrophic Health Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House tax-writers are weighing a plan to shift
more of the burden of the catastrophic health insurance program onto
older Americans with incomes of less than $25,000 a year.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, who would prefer to leave the Medicare catastrophic
program as is, offered a package Tuesday that would cut the cost of
the new insurance coverage for those with higher incomes.
   But Rostenkowski said the cool reception to his plan and pressure
from high-income earners among the elderly increased the likelihood
that catastrophic coverage will be repealed.
   Under current law, a typical couple with income between $15,000
and $20,000 would pay $59 for coverage in 1990. Rostenkowski
proposes to raise that to $101. A couple earning about $70,000, now
scheduled to pay $909, would pay $527 instead.
   ``It was not very well-received,'' Rostenkowski told reporters
after a closed committee session.
   Rostenkowski suggested the financing changes as part of a new
package he wants the committee to add to a bill, already approved,
designed to raise $5.3 billion in revenues for deficit reduction in
the next budget year.
   His proposals include:
   _A new tax that would cost the chemical industry _ and,
eventually, buyers of refrigerators and air conditioners _ about
$8.5 billion over five years. The tax would be imposed on
chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that are widely used in
cooling and insulation but which harm the Earth's ozone layer.
   _Reversing an earlier decision and allow individuals to deduct 10
percent of their credit cards, education loans and other consumer
interest in 1990.
   _Permanent extension of the 3 percent tax on telephone service.
   _A new tax of about $2 billion on mutual life insurance companies.
   _A significant expansion of federal tax assistance for
lower-income working families, part of an effort to improve aid for
child care. It would expand the earned-income credit, which gives a
working family with children and income under about $18,000 a tax
reduction _ or cash payment if no taxes are owed _ of up to $910.
The credit would rise to a maximum $1,217 for one child, $1,504 for
two children and $1,790 for three or more.
   An additional credit of up to $430 would be allowed if any child
is under age 6.
   _Extension of several tax benefits that have expired are due to
expire. These include a tax exclusion for tuition assistance
provided by an employer; a credit for employers who hire
disadvantaged workers; a benefit for those who invest in low-income
rental housing, and a 20 percent credit for increased investment in
research and experimentation.
   The toughest decision facing the committee is what to do about
the new law that insures older Americans against some costs of a
catastrophic illness. Many retirees object that it is financed
principally by a surtax on the elderly.
   Most of the money is raised from the 40 percent of people 65 and
older whose total income taxes exceed $150 a year. They pay a surtax
of 15 percent of taxes, with a 1989 maximum surtax of $800. Fewer
than 6 percent will pay the maximum.
   The remainder of the cost is financed through a $4 increase in
the $27.90 monthly premium paid for Medicare Part B, which covers
physicians' fees.
   Rostenkowski's new plan would cut the surtax by about two-thirds,
to a rate of 5 percent this year, with a maximum of $800, and the
rate would rise gradually to 10 percent (instead of 28 percent under
current law) in 1993.
   However, it would increase the Part B premium, which is paid by
all but the poorest beneficiaries. That premium, totaling $31.90 for
1989, would, when current-law increases are included, rise to $51 in
1993.

<HEAD>Scientist Find Chunks of Moon, and Perhaps Mars, on Earth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American scientists are finding rocks from the
moon _ and perhaps Mars _ in the glaciers of Antarctica, and one
expert says they may have been slung into orbit by an asteroid
collision during ancient times.
   ``We are certain that these samples are from the moon,'' said
William Cassidy, a University of Pittsburgh geologist.
   The rocks, deposited on ancient polar show fields hundreds of
thousands of years ago, match chemical characteristics of lunar
samples collected by astronauts on the six Apollo lunar missions, he
said. Matching the samples create what geologists call ``ground
truth.''
   ``We don't know from where on the moon they came, but we know
they have to (be from places) more widespread than the four percent
that we've sampled (by Apollo),'' Cassidy said Tuesday at the
International Geological Congress.
   Cassidy said it is believed that the Antarctic moon rocks got to
Earth when, in some ancient time, an asteroid smashed into the lunar
surface with such great violence that chunks of the moon were slung
into orbit. It would take less force to do this from the lunar
surface because the moon has only one-sixth of the Earth's gravity.
   Once in orbit, the moon rocks could eventually be swept up by the
Earth. The lunar material would streak through the atmosphere and
then crash into the Earth's surface.
   Most such objects hit the oceans, where they are lost, or on land
surfaces where they are weathered and eroded beyond recognition.
   But in the Antarctic, time is frozen in gigantic sheets of ice
that lie virtually unchanged for up to 20 million years. Moon rocks
that come to rest there remain untouched and nearly pristine,
awaiting collection by Cassidy and his team.
   Other types of rocks from space also are found on the frozen
polar plains.
   Cassidy said two rare samples, called shurgitites, have been
found that may have originated from Mars.
   ``We don't really know if that's the case because we don't have
ground truth (matched samples from a known source),'' he said. But
Cassidy said the fact that moon rocks hit Earth support the idea
that other samples could be from Mars.
   ``The lunar samples ... lend credence to the view that you really
can hit a planet with an asteroid and knock off a meteoroid and get
it into orbit,'' he said. ``This lends credence to the idea that the
shurgitites could have come from Mars and are really martian
samples.''
   Final proof, he said, will have to come from a sampling mission
to Mars.
   Cassidy said that about 12,000 other types of meteorites have
been gathered from the ice in Antarctica. He said he and his team
find the space rocks by systematically searching using snowmobiles.
   ``The meteorites are just lying around on the ice,'' he said.
Most are about the size of a ``large olive,'' but some are as large
as grapefruit.
   The fragments are photographed, collected in sealed bags and
transported, still frozen, to the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
In a special laboratory there, they are warmed and dried in a pure
nitrogen atmosphere. Sections are cut from the samples and sent for
study by scientists in 17 nations.
   Cassidy said when the study of Antarctic meteorites first began
20 years ago, scientists hoped to find samples that were as old as
the polar ice sheets where they were found.
   ``We hoped we could look back 20 million years,'' he said. ``But
the oldest one we've found is only about 900,000 years old. We've
found two that are 700,000 years old. The bulk have fallen over just
the last 300,000 years.''
   And in a solar system more than four billion years old, he said,
that's but a brief moment.

<HEAD>Man Chains Self to Sofa in Bid to Kick Cigarette Habit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY NACHTIGAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas Warren tried several methods,
including acupuncture and Smokers Anonymous, to break a 20-year
nicotine addiction.
   Nothing worked.
   Now, the 42-year-old Springfield man has had himself chained to a
280-pound sofa in his living room and rid his home of tobacco. He
intends to remain on the leash for three weeks in a drastic attempt
to kick the habit for good.
   ``I had my friends come over here and take a crescent wrench and
tie me up so there was no way of getting off,'' Warren said Tuesday,
his eighth day of being connected to the thin, 30-foot steel cable.
``I admitted that I was powerless over cigarettes and that they had
made my life unmanageable.
   ``I had to take control of the situation.''
   Warren describes himself as an artist, dog trainer and drug
counselor who beat a cocaine addiction 11 years ago. A pack-a-day
cigarette habit sticks with him, however.
   ``It's a crazy habit that's ruining my life,'' he said. ``It's
self-destructive, it's unhealthy. I used to run marathons, but I've
got respiratory problems now and can't run anymore. I can't do a lot
of the exercises that I'm used to doing.''
   Warren, who lives alone, roams about his small, secluded home
with the thin cable fastened at his neck by a bolt, like a dog
collar. His golden retriever, Rachel, can roam the yard, but
Warren's leash limits him from stepping much past the front porch.
   Warren, a Vietnam veteran, began smoking when he was in the Army.
He said it's especially important to quit smoking because of his
involvement with drug education.
   ``I'm going on the drug-lecturing circuit in September. I can't
smoke cigarettes and sit there and tell people how to get off
drugs,'' he said.
   He said he sought help to quit smoking from the Veterans
Administration, but was told VA hospitals didn't offer such a
program. Acupuncture, Smokers Anonymous, meditation, cutting back to
a quarter-pack and trying to quit cold turkey also failed.
   ``I felt the only way I could whip this once and for all and take
control of my life was to chain myself up,'' he said.
   Warren decided to chain himself for three weeks to guarantee a
modification of behavior, even though his body probably was free of
nicotine after three days.
   He said the urge to smoke in the first few days of confinement
was intense, adding, ``If you offered me a cigarette right now, I'd
say no way.''
   He had to chase away friends who smoked when they stopped by
because the temptation to ask them for a cigarette was too great.
   One man who saw a news report about Warren offered to sell him
herbal cigarettes, which he claimed contained no nicotine.
   ``I didn't want anything to do with those,'' Warren said with a
laugh. ``I'd already tried them before. They taste awful.''
   Jennifer Moore, a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society in
Springfield, conceded that Warren's attempt to quit is
unconventional.
   ``There certainly are other methods I'd have suggested he explore
before resorting to that,'' she said. ``But I think what he's doing
shows how really bad he wants to quit and how powerful a drug like
nicotine is. It is just as powerful as cocaine or heroin.''
   Warren, who spends his days painting, keeping a journal and
watching movies, feels optimistic he will never smoke again once his
chain comes off later this month.
   ``I love to smoke, but I love to live more,'' he said.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Take Debate Over Thrifts Behind Closed Doors</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators are bargaining
over a savings and loan bailout measure behind closed doors after
narrowing the major disputes between them to how to pay for the
rescue and who will regulate the most troublesome element of the
industry.
   Representatives of the two chambers agreed Tuesday to meet
informally in private the rest of this week with the aim of settling
what were described as minor differences on other issues.
   ``We ought to, over the next couple of days, get the legislative
language worked out so that we have the basis of a single package,''
said the Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., the chief Senate negotiator.
   The biggest stumbling block is a fight, largely along party
lines, on how to raise the $50 billion needed immediately to cover
the losses of federally insured deposits in some 500 failed S&amp;Ls,
mainly in Texas and California.
   President Bush and other Republicans want to raise the money
through 30-year private bonds in order to avoid swelling the federal
deficit.
   Democrats want to make the administration borrow the money
directly through the Treasury _ saying it would reduce the bailout's
total cost by $4.5 billion over 30 years _ but exempt the new debt
from annual deficit-reduction targets.
   Each side has enough votes in the Senate _ 41 _ on the issue to
stymie the other. Despite the little room for bargaining, several
House-Senate conferees said Tuesday they were looking to the White
House and the legislative leaders for a compromise.
   Meanwhile, Riegle said he hopes the other major hurdle _ whether
the Treasury Department or the more independent Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. should be put in charge of some 1,200
state-chartered thrifts _ will be ``resolved somewhere along the
way.''
   Loose regulation, particularly by Florida, California and Texas,
over state-chartered but federally insured thrifts is blamed for
losses totaling more than $50 billion to risky and often fraudulent
loans.
   Bush and the Senate want to regulate those institutions, as well
as more than 1,700 federally chartered thrifts, through a new Office
of Thrift Supervision in the Treasury Department.
   House conferees insisted Tuesday on giving FDIC Chairman L.
William Seidman rather than the Treasury the chief federal
regulator's role over state-chartered thrifts.
   However, one House source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the regulatory turf battle as a ``throw-away chip'' to be
used to ``get something'' in the form of a Senate concession on
another issue.
   Riegle and chief House negotiator Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, expressed optimism that agreement on a single package _
excluding the financing issue _ could be reached by Friday.
   ``We've got the train moving; we ought to keep the ball
rolling,'' Gonzalez said.
   The path was cleared for the informal talks after the House
conferees agreed tentatively Tuesday to retreat from their demand to
outlaw junk bond ownership by S&amp;Ls, a provision the Senate would
allow to continue.
   As a compromise, Gonzalez proposed and the Senate conferees
tentatively accepted a measure giving the FDIC and other regulators
discretion to say how many junk bonds S&amp;Ls can hold in their
portfolios.

<HEAD>Nationalist Party to Hold First Primary Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANNIE HUANG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Nationalist Party holds its
first primary election Sunday in a sign that further democratic
change is coming to Taiwan, once the exclusive political domain of
party elders.
   The primary will select candidates for general legislative
elections in December, when the Nationalists will for the first time
face a challenge from a legal opposition party.
   Opposition parties were forbidden under martial law, which until
two years ago had been in effect since 1949, when the Nationalist
government fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war on the Chinese
mainland.
   Martial law was lifted as part of a political liberalization
program begun by former President Chiang Ching-kuo, son of former
Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek.
   The primary is in response to complaints from many of the ruling
party's 2 million members about the long-standing practice of
allowing party bosses to choose candidates for national elections.
They claimed only loyalists who toed the official party line were
selected.
   President Lee Teng-hui, who also heads the party, has promised
the primary would establish ``a fair and open system'' for choosing
qualified candidates. Any incumbent legislator or a person receiving
endorsement from 0.2 percent of party members within a district can
run.
   ``Party members no longer blindly accept orders from the top,''
said political science Professor Hu Fu of the National Taiwan
University. ``We are still a long way from true democracy but the
primary could push the Nationalists to move toward that direction.''
   The primary will choose about 100 candidates from a field of 250.
The process so far has had its rough spots.
   Premier Lee Huan's son, Lee Ching-hua, was forced to withdraw
after opponents claimed his candidacy was designed to perpetuate his
family's influence.
   The younger Lee, the popular secretary-general of Taiwan's
Olympic committee, said he dropped out because his father was
``nearly suffocated'' by criticism of the candidacy.
   Several candidates claimed local Nationalist offices with close
links to the military told party members to vote for certain
candidates, leading to accusations of military intervening in
politics.
   Candidate Wang Lin-lin showed the media a letter she claimed was
sent by the military to party members in her district asking that
they vote for a retired serviceman.
   ``Some party officials have not adjusted their old mentality,''
she said. ``They still want to call the shots. The old tactics
employed against the opposition are now used to hurt the party's own
candidates.''
   Party officials denied the allegations. But political observers
believe the Nationalist officials might be backing candidates loyal
to them to prevent losing control of the new legislature.
   ``If many candidates win the elections on their own, they may not
support the party's policies,'' said Chu Yun-han, a political
science professor at National Taiwan University.
   The primary also has been marred by rumors of some candidates
giving away expensive watches, foreign cigarettes or money to buy
votes. Officials said they were investigating the reports.
   The Democratic Progressive Party, the main opposition party, also
will hold a primary Sunday for its 20,000 members to elect 48
candidates from a field of 52.
   The party's populist platform attracts many native Taiwanese, who
constitute 85 percent of the island's 20 million people. The
remaining 15 percent are largely mainland Chinese whose families
came to the island during the Nationalist retreat.
   At stake in the December elections are 101 seats in the
Legislative Yuan, the highest lawmaking body.
   Not facing re-election are the 182 Yuan members, mostly
Nationalists, who were elected on the mainland before 1949 and
frozen in office because of the Nationalist claim to still be the
legitimate government of all China.
   As the aging lawmakers die or resign, Taiwan-elected members will
play an increasingly important role and can transform the Yuan from
a rubber-stamp organization, professor Hu said.

<TEXT>
   High tide has a new meaning these
days along Texas' Gulf Coast.
   Dozens of bundles of cocaine with an estimated street value of $5
million have washed up along more than 200 miles of coast during the
past three weeks, attracting a new breed of beachcomber to the
area's tiny fishing and resort towns.
   ``Everybody's talking about it and I think everybody's looking
for it,'' said Herb Knowles, who works at the Dirty Pelican Pier in
Crystal Beach, about 30 miles east of Galveston. ``Guys on the
weekend are out here at night on three-wheeled vehicles with big
spotlights on the beach.
   ``You tell me what they're looking for.''
   The first discovery occurred June 28 when five packages weighing
a total of about 14.5 pounds were found in the sand on Matagorda
Island, about 100 miles southwest of Houston.
   A week and a half later, five bundles totaling about 78 pounds
washed ashore on the Bolivar Peninsula across from Galveston, and 19
bundles weighing about 81 pounds were discovered by the Matagorda
County sheriff's department.
   The latest find occurred Thursday when six men fishing about 10
miles off Galveston found 25 bundles with 83 pounds of cocaine
floating in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Altogether, 61 packages containing 261 pounds of 98 percent pure,
uncut cocaine have been discovered by authorities or turned in to
them.
   ``It all has the same markings, which leads us to believe it's
from the same load,'' said James E. Caldwell, supervisory special
agent for the U.S. Customs Service in Galveston.
   Marine biologists have estimated the cocaine was in the water
from three weeks to a couple of months. It was bundled in watertight
packages of five bricks, each wrapped in fiberglass resin and duct
tape and then tied together with yellow plastic rope.
   Each brick was marked with the word ``CENTAVO'' and the
designation ``T5.'' On some of the bricks also is written ``USA 2.''
   The drugs probably came from Colombia, Caldwell said. How they
wound up in the gulf is anyone's guess.
   ``It could have been from a ship that went down. It could have
been an air drop. They could have tied it off with floats,'' he said.
   Officials have speculated that a drug boat may have been wrecked
during Tropical Storm Allison last month, dumping the contraband in
the gulf.
   Galveston County Sheriff Joe Max Taylor said these are the first
instances of cocaine washing ashore in Texas, although bales of
marijuana have washed up in the past.
   Texas isn't the only state awash in cocaine. More than 150 pounds
of cocaine has been found on and off South Carolina beaches during
the past two weeks, perhaps the result of an unsuccessful air drop
by smugglers, federal officials have said.
   In Texas, the Coast Guard and some sheriff's departments made
special cocaine patrols last week along miles of desolate beach, but
most of the search now is confined to routine patrols.
   ``We're not doing anything special,'' said Petty Officer Bowde
West of the Coast Guard Station at Port O'Connor. ``But this
definitely is the talk of the town, that's for sure.''
   ``People like to keep it quiet, but they were wanting to comb the
beaches to look,'' added Susie Segura, who can see miles of open
beach from her perch on Meacom's Pier off High Island, northeast of
Galveston.
   Knowles said he's seen everything from parts of houses to
bathtubs come ashore, but no cocaine yet. If he does, he said he'd
leave the package on the beach and call police.
   ``Nine times out of 10, they might think it was mine to begin
with,'' he said.
   The cocaine that's been discovered will be flown to Dallas where
federal authorities will destroy it, Caldwell said.
   ``It's pretty potent,'' he said. ``I imagine there have been some
people sick who see this on television. But some of it might still
be in the gulf.''

   Move over, watch dogs. Step aside, security
guards. Attack snake does the job.
   Gale Gunter-Schultz said she had thought about posting a sign in
her yard warning prowlers that guarding her premises in this
northeast Georgia city was an ``attack snake'' _ her 10{-foot
Burmese python named Balthazar.
   She didn't, though, catching a burglar unawares.
   Mrs. Gunter-Schultz said her husband arrived home from a weekend
trip to find the window pried open to the bathroom _ where the
hungry python sleeps.
   ``Balthazar was probably pretty testy,'' Mrs. Gunter-Schultz
said. ``He had just shed, and that makes him hungry. Plus, it was
time for his regular feeding.''
   The python's last meal of two live rats was two weeks ago.
   Mrs. Gunter-Schultz said Balthazar probably hissed and struck at
the burglar.
   Police reported that the thief left the house undisturbed. A tire
iron, used to pry open the window, was found near the house.
   ``I never, never thought that he would stop a burglar,'' Mrs.
Gunter-Schultz said. ``He's usually pretty mellow.''

   Two innkeepers are offering customers
$1 per mosquito bite to combat the notion that Vermont has been
taken over by bloodthirsty bugs.
   Robert Lynch and Thomas Nunan are giving a ``bounty for bites''
after publicity on state funding for the town of Brandon's insect
control program led to cancellations of inn reservations across the
state.
   Brandon, about 60 miles northwest of Saxtons River, has been hit
especially hard by the blood-sucking bugs this year. But most other
parts of the state don't have mosquito problems.
   Lynch, owner of the Saxtons River Inn, claimed his business was
off by 20 percent because of widespread mosquito fear, with 100
cancellations in June alone.
   Nunan, who owns the Black River Inn in Ludlow, said two bicycle
tours were cancelled at his inn this mnth because of the news
reports.
   He said other innkeepers have received calls from people who said
they would only visit with a guarantee of no bites.
   In response to the mosquito publicity, the state will spend
$40,000 to promote tourism, but the ads have no mention of the bugs.
   Lynch likes his bounty idea better.
   ``You've got the hit the problem directly, not smooth it over,''
he said.

<HEAD>Kenya Burns $3 Million in Elephant Tusks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIDRIKKE SCHANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Setting fire to 2,500 ivory tusks worth $3
million, President Daniel arap Moi said he wanted to draw attention
to a continent-wide slaughter that threatens to wipe out Africa's
elephant in 10 years.
   Hundreds of government officials, diplomats, journalists and
conservationists watched Tuesday as Moi put a torch to the 12 tons
ivory atop a 20-foot pile of wood.
   The pyre was placed on a hill in Nairobi National Park
overlooking the vast Athi Plains that are home to gazelle, rhino,
giraffe, zebra, lions and other wild animals.
   ``Actions speak louder than words,'' Moi said. ``Kenya cannot
appeal to the world to stop buying ivory if at the same time we are
selling the very same commodity.''
   Conservationists and many nations have called for a worldwide ban
on the ivory trade.
   Kenya's elephant population has fallen from 65,000 in the l970s
to about l7,000. In all of Africa, poaching has cut the elephant
population from an estimated 1.5 million in the 1970s to fewer than
700,000 today.
   Iain Douglas-Hamilton, an elephant expert, said the burn was
``immensely important'' and he hoped it would help make people in
ivory consuming nations aware that if they ``buy, wear or sell
ivory, they're helping kill elephants.''
   Moi said he also will destroy 270 rhino horns Kenya confiscated
from poachers, but did not say when.
   Despite a rhino horn trading ban, Africa's rhino population has
dwindled from 65,000 in the early 1970s to an estimated 4,000.
   Conservationists say the ban has failed because the horn is still
highly prized in the Far East, where it is sold in powdered form as
an aphrodisiac.
   Moi said his government will continue to destroy all ivory
confiscated within its borders.
   ``I hope our action will help persuade others to appreciate the
urgent need to take drastic steps to halt the wanton slaughter of
elephants by declining to trade in ivory and its products both
within Africa and beyond,'' Moi said.
   The ivory burned Tuesday represented four years' worth of tusks
confiscated from poachers.
   More than 600 gallons of gasoline fueled the fire, since ivory
only burns under intense heat. The top half of the pyre was
blackened after about an hour.
   Richard Leakey, Kenya's director of wildlife, said the government
has increased the number of game patrols and he said poaching has
fallen drastically in the past two months.
   About 300 elephants were killed in the first five months of 1989.
   Ivory fetches $109 to $154 a pound on the world market, with the
higher prices going for the increasingly rare larger tusks. An
average tusk weighs nearly 11 pounds, down from nearly 22 pounds a
decade ago.
   Kenya has joined a growing list of countries that support a
worldwide ban on the ivory trade. Conservationists say the ban would
likely work because the elephant tusk is used only for decorative
purposes.
   The EEC, Japan and the United States buy up to 75 percent of
ivory on world markets. But in June, the United States, Japan, the
12-nation European Economic Community, Switzerland and Canada
imposed bans on ivory imports.
   The Lausanne, Switzerland-based 102-nation Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species will meet in October to
consider a worldwide ban.
   Zimbabwe, South Africa and Botswana oppose the ban. They say they
have successfully protected their elephants while herds in other
African nations have declined.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
sharply Wednesday, while the dollar edged down against the Japanese
yen.
   The dollar ended at 141.80 yen, down 0.55 yen from Tuesday's
close of 142.35 yen. It started at 141.75 yen and moved between
141.75 yen and 142.40 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 213.44
points, or 0.64 percent, to finish at 33,557.17, ending five
consecutive trading days of decline. It had lost more than 400
points from last Wednesday to Tuesday.
   ``But there was no strong buying incentive in the market because
Sunday's election was making investors nervous,'' said a dealer with
Nikko Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Analysts have predicted the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
which has been suffering from a series of setbacks including an
influence-peddling scandal and an unpopular consumer tax, will lose
badly in the upcoming election for the upper house of the parliament.
   Dealers said Japanese investors have stayed away from buying
before the election because of fears a Liberal Democrat election
loss would lead to a plunge in the Nikkei.
   In currency dealings, the dollar's slip followed a
wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for May.
   Traders said the dollar is not further weakening despite the U.S.
trade deficit because of pessimism over the Liberal Democarts'
performance in Sunday's election.

   Some senators say rising prices for
prescription drugs may hurt health care for the elderly in the near
future.
   Steadily rising prescription prices have driven up the costs of
Medicaid programs and are a concern as well for the Medicare program.
   ``From 1981 through 1988, the prescription drug inflation rate of
88 percent dwarfed the general inflation rate of 28 percent,'' Sen.
David Pryor, chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, said
Tuesday.
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., agreed, saying ``soon many elderly
will be priced out of the market.''
   A report by the panel's Democratic staff said most of the drugs
pharmaceutical companies put on the market are duplicates of drugs
already being sold. It said 84 percent of the 348 drugs brought to
market by the 25 biggest companies between 1981 and 1988 were judged
by the Food and Drug Administration as providing ``little or no''
therapeutic potential to improve on existing drugs.

   Former presidential aide Michael K. Deaver is
seeking to cut from $100,000 to $25,000 the federal court fine he
was assessed for lying under oath about his lobbying business.
   Deaver's request was made to U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who imposed the sentence on Deaver, the former deputy chief
of staff for President Reagan.
   The request by Deaver says he wants the fine reduced because he
has legal bills of more than $1 million.
   But Whitney North Seymour, the independent counsel who prosecuted
Deaver's case, said the fine could be paid by selling Deaver's
house. Seymour's answer to Deaver's appeal said Deaver paid $990,000
for the house in 1985, but claimed it is now worth $1.45 million.

   Before his death earlier this month, former
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko added a chapter about Joseph
Stalin to his soon-to-be published autobiography, according to a
published report.
   The New York Times in today's editions said the book _ derived
from Gromyko's two-volume autobiography published in a Soviet
edition last year _ is to include a preface by former U.S. Secretary
of State Henry Kissinger.
   Heyward Isham, who acquired the book for Doubleday, told the
Times the new chapter will criticize Stalin.
   ``His book has many comments about Stalin, in the context of
Yalta and so forth,'' said Isham.
   Yalta, a Soviet city, was the site of a treaty signing that set
up post-World War II superpower relations.
   ``But heretofore, he did not attempt to show how Stalin imposed a
one-man despotism without any of (Vladimir) Lenin's former
associates or the party itself trying to stop him,'' said Isham.
``Gromyko, a patriotic Communist, provides a very anguished
explanation.''

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index halted a losing
streak and sharply rebounded today, while the dollar lost ground
against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 213.44
points, or 0.64 percent, to finish at 33,557.17 and end five
straight trading days of losses.
   ``But it was not an active trading that could build up energy in
the market,'' said Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura
Securities. Umemori said volume was small.
   First-section volume was estimated at 330 million shares,
slightly up from Tuesday's 300 million. Among the winners were
housing-related issues.
   In currency dealings, the dollar ended at 141.80 yen, down 0.55
yen from Tuesday's close of 142.35 yen. It started at 141.75 yen and
moved between 141.75 yen and 142.40 yen.
   The fluctuation in the dollar-yen rate today was mainly due to
position adjustment and profit-taking, said a trader with the Bank
of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Bank of Japan also reportedly intervened in the market by
selling some dollars. The central bank does not publicly comment on
its monetary activities.
   The dollar hit the day's high in midday trading, as institutional
investors bought the dollar after its lower opening following a
wider-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for May, he said.
   The U.S. Commerce Department reported Tuesday the nation's trade
deficit rose sharply to a seasonally adjusted $10.24 billion in May
from $8.29 billion in April.
   Despite the growing U.S. trade deficit, the dollar did not weaken
because of more pessimism over the yen, mainly due to the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's expected poor performance in upper house
elections this weekend.
   ``Market sentiment is basically moving toward the weaker yen,''
he said.

<HEAD>Parliament To Investigate Former Socialist Premier and His Ministers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP DOPOULOS</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new parliament voted overwhelmingly
early today to investigate former Socialist Premier Andreas
Papandreou and four of his senior Cabinet ministers to see if they
should be charged with corruption.
   The decision to set up a 12-member parliamentary committee to
investigate the former officials' alleged involvement in a $200
million scandal involving the Bank of Crete came at the close of two
days of stormy debate.
   Along with Papandreou, former Cabinet ministers Agamemnon
Koutsogiorgas, Panayiotis Roumeliotis, George Petsos and Dimitris
Tsovolas, have been accused of ordering state-run companies to
deposit the equivalent of $12 million in the troubled Bank of Crete
in order to skim off the interest.
   Koutsogiorgas had served as deputy premier and justice minister;
Roumeliotis held the national economy portfolio; Petsos was
transport minister and later public order minister; and Tsovolas was
finance minister.
   Former Bank of Crete chairman Giorgos Koskotas, who has accused
Papandreou of authorizing the alleged scheme, is in a Salem, Mass.
jail fighting extradition. A decision is expected later this month.
   The Bank of Crete case was one of a series of scandals that
contributed to defeat of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK)
in June 18 parliamentary elections.
   Voters failed to give any one party an absolute parliamentry
majority, prompting the conservatives and a communist alliance to
form a coalition government.
   The 300-member unicameral parliament decided on each of the five
former Socialist officials by secret ballot and overwhelmingly
favored investigating all of them.
   The parliamentary proceedings were carried live by state-run
Hellenic Radio and Television. Most Greeks were glued to their
television sets or radios till the early morning hours.
   The investigative committee has three weeks to complete its
findings and decide whether there are grounds for prosecution by a
special civil court comprised of Supreme Court judges.
   The 70-year-old Papandreou, on his honeymoon after marrying
35-year-old former airline hostess Dimitra Liani last week, has
denied any wrongdoing. He had told his deputies they were free to
vote according to their conscience.
   The coalition government was formed with a three-month mandate to
investigate the scandals that wracked the former Socialist
administration. At the end of the 90 days, the governing coalition,
led by conservative Premier Tzannis Tzannnetakis, said it will call
new elections.
   In last month's elections, the conservative New Democracy party
won 145 seats in parliament, the Communist-controlled Coalition of
the Left and Progress won 28 and PASOK received 125.
   The two remaining seats went to a small conservative group and an
independent.

<TEXT>
   The wife of former Soviet dissident Natan
Sharansky flew from Israel to testify in behalf of E. Robert Wallach
at the Wedtech racketeering trial, but a judge temporarily blocked
her testimony.
   U.S. District Judge Richard Owen, saying he had yet to decide
whether she qualified as a character witness, planned to announce
his decision today.
   The New York Daily News reported, however, that Sharansky and his
wife, Avital, returned home Tuesday night.
   Wallach's attorney, Gary Naftalis, pleaded with Owen to allow
Mrs. Sharansky to take the stand Tuesday.
   He said the couple could stay for only one day because Mrs.
Sharansky's mother was dying.
   ``I'm upset,'' Mrs. Sharansky told the Daily News. ``My mother is
dying and I have two little children. I have never left them before.
I am sorry that my testimony will not be heard.''
   For his part, Owen said he wanted to review the law before making
a decision. ``I'm not going to be rushed into this,'' he said.
   Wallach, a San Francisco attorney and longtime friend of former
U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, is charged with two others in a
21-count racketeering indictment with illegally extracting almost $2
million from the now-defunct Wedtech Corp. The charges include some
$525,000 in bribes to Wallach to influence Meese and other
government officials.
   Once a small machine shop, Wedtech grew into a $100 million
government contractor through a special program that set aside
contracts without competitive bidding for minority-controlled
companies.
   Owen questioned Mrs. Sharansky outside the presence of the jury
to determine how well she knew Wallach.
   She said Wallach, whom she met in 1982, had been instrumental in
alerting Reagan administration officials about the plight of her
husband, who spent nine years in a Soviet prison camp.
   Sharansky, in court with his wife Tuesday, was released in March
1986.
   Wallach was available to her ``night and day'' to discuss
problems and strategy in her efforts to free her husband, said Mrs.
Sharansky.
   ``Always if he promised something to me, he did it,'' she said.
He never asked for compensation, she said.
   Wallach sought help for Sharansky from Meese, former national
security adviser Robert McFarlane and numerous members of Congress,
she said. He also introduced her to former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss opposed calling Mrs.
Sharansky as a character witness. He said her testimony was
``designed to appeal to the sympathy of the jury in a way that a
character witness is not allowed.''
   Mrs. Sharansky was to be the 10th character witness called by
Wallach's defense team.

   Jokers trying to make a fast buck with
counterfeit Batman merchandise had better think twice, Warner Bros.
has warned.
   The company said Tuesday it has confiscated more than 40,000
items bearing phony Batman symbols in nationwide legal actions
against purveyors of pirated merchandise.
   ``We don't license schlock,'' said J. Joseph Bainton, counsel for
Warner Communication Cos. ``My mother raised me to believe that
stealing's wrong.''
   U.S. marshals helped seize T-shirts, hats, shorts, medallions and
other rip-offs under a series of nationwide federal lawsuits since
the first week in June. The movie opened June 23.
   The raids were ordered on the streets of New York, Philadelphia
and Washington, D.C.; at flea markets in New York and Los Angeles;
manufacturers and distributors in New York, Los Angeles and Florida;
retail stores in New York; and through U.S. Customs in Los Angeles.
   Dan Romanelli, Warner's president of worldwide merchandising,
said the forgeries result in ``many, many millions of dollars'' in
losses for Warner; LCA Entertainment, the licensing agent; and DC
Comics.
   Wholesale domestic revenues for official Batman items are
projected at $250 million, he said.
   Real Batman shirts retail for $8 to $18, depending on the
manufacturer. The fakes go for about $5.
   ``From across the street, they look the same,'' said Bainton.
   But he said that the rip-offs fall apart quickly.
   Romanelli said they are marred by ``shoddy artwork'' that ``is
going to run as soon as it's washed.''
   ``In one way, it's a nice problem to have because the fakes are a
barometer for the market for the legitimate merchandise,'' said
Bainton, who predicted sales would explode at Halloween.
   Warner may donate the confiscated clothing to charity.
   Bainton said the penalties are $500 to $20,000 for someone who
sells rip-offs unknowingly; $100,000 for someone who sells them
willfully; and up to five years in jail for those who refuse to obey
a court order.
   About 90 retail outlets in New York City are under court order to
stop selling the rip-offs, said Bainton.
   Warner has hundreds of professional investigators around the
country. And its employees also report rip-offs.
   Their reward, said Romanelli, will be ``Bat points to keep the
Joker at bay.''

   Mayor Coleman A. Young announced a bid for a
record fifth term, telling supporters ``ain't nobody going to run me
out.''
   ``If you can't stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen, because
we're cooking up something,'' Young, 71, said Tuesday at a community
center. ``We're cooking up unity ... respect ... and love.''
   Since his narrow victory in 1973, Detroit's first black mayor has
won three subsequent elections easily and was expected to run again
this year. Young's campaign fund is estimated at $5 million.
   Eight weeks remain before a non-partisan Sept. 12 mayoral
primary, when voters will select two candidates for a runoff Nov. 7.
   Challengers to Young include City Council President Erma
Henderson, unsuccessful 1985 mayoral candidate Thomas Barrow,
businessman Charles Costa and self-described ``candidate of God''
James A. Williams.
   Young's critics have accused him of focusing on downtown
development in the nation's sixth-largest city at the expense of
neighborhoods.
   But the mayor told a crowd of about 1,500 cheering supporters
that he has helped rebuild the city in his 15{ years in office and
has plenty more to do.
   ``There's been a lot accomplished _ even Ray Charles could see
that,'' Young said. ``But there's a lot more to be done ... we will
complete the rebuilding of the city of Detroit.
   ``I'll leave if I want to, but ain't nobody going to run me out.''
   As mayor, he succeeded in integrating the police and fire
departments and landed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal
and state economic development grants, many of them for downtown
projects along the Detroit River.
   Young's years in office also have seen a continuation of the
white and middle-class flight from the city to the suburbs that
began shortly after World War II and accelerated with the 1967 riots
that left 37 dead and devastated large sections of the city.
   Detroit, which had a population of 2 million in 1950, now has
about 1 million residents in a metropolitan area that has grown to
more than 4 million. About two-thirds of city residents are black.
   Businesses and retailers have fled the city as well, and its
increasingly impoverished neighborhoods have seen violence, drug
abuse and crime steadily rise.
   ``When Young visits a neighborhood, it's like he's touring a
foreign country,'' Barrow said Monday. ``At least when President
Bush went to Poland, he left them with a promise.''
   Young also has drawn criticism for his delay in acknowledging he
was the father of a 6-year-old boy born to former city official
Annivory Calvert, now the public works director in Fontana, Calif.
   Young agreed to pay support for the boy after blood tests
confirmed he was the father.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies in
early European trading today, weakened by dollar-selling after
Tuesday's worse-than-expected U.S. trade deficit. Gold prices fell
in Europe.
   Dealers said the dollar showed signs of recovering in late
morning trading ahead of today's release of the U.S. consumer price
index for June.
   U.S. economists predicted in a survey that the index would rise
0.3 percent, compared with a 0.6 percent rise in May.
   Earlier, the Bank of Japan continued a bout of dollar-selling
sparked by the U.S. government's report of a $10.2 billion
merchandise trade deficit for May.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6215 from $1.6255 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8980 West German marks, down from 1.9138
   _1.6430 Swiss francs, up from 1.6395
   _6.4395 French francs, up from 6.4175

   Earlier, the dollar fell in Tokyo to a closing 141.80 Japanese
yen from 142.35 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, the dollar
slipped further to 141.67 yen.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $372.15 a troy ounce, up
from $371.95 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a lower recommended price of $371.50.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $371.30, down from $371.50 bid
late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 84 cents to a closing bid of

<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms and a tornado blasted north-central Texas,
flipping a trailer over four times and blowing a barn into a road.
Heavy rain early today drenched parts of five Southern states.
   Rains also poured on Chicago, with nearly 4 inches falling in a
suburb.
   In Throckmorton, Texas, geologist Steve Rezaie suffered possible
broken legs and ribs after he was blown out of his trailer when a
tornado moved through the area about 6 p.m. Tuesday. He was being
treated at a hospital in Throckmorton, about 150 miles northwest of
Dallas.
   ``I was in the trailer working and then it started rolling,''
said Rezaie. ``It rolled over four times and I didn't know what was
going on. I was scared to death. It threw me out of the trailer and
that's the last thing I remember.''
   A Haskell County Sheriff's Department dispatcher said the storm
also moved through the southern part of that county, blowing a barn
into a road.
   A squall also hit Monahans, about 220 miles west of Throckmorton,
about 10 p.m., a local radio station reported.
   ``We've got blackouts, walls of buildings blown down, street
flooding, U-Haul trailers blown across the highway,'' said Allen
Martin, news director of KLBO. ``Here's something you don't see in
the desert _ we've got a boat in the road.''
   No injuries were reported.
   The thunderstorms in the Chicago area were part of a large area
of showers and thunderstorms that extended from the upper Great
Lakes across the lower Ohio Valley to northern Texas.
   The most widespread area of thunderstorms this morning was in
Arkansas and northeast Texas, and into parts of northern Louisiana,
Mississippi and western Tennessee.
   Flash flood watches were in effect this morning for southern
Arkansas and western Tennessee.
   Severe thunderstorms also hit the southern Plains and lower
Mississippi Valley late Tuesday. Golf ball-sized hail pelted parts
of Oklahoma.
   The high temperature in the nation Tuesday was 120 degrees at
Death Valley, Calif.
   Today's forecast called for widespread rain and thunderstorms
from the lower Great Lakes and western parts of New England through
the Ohio and Tennessee valleys into Mississippi and Alabama; and
scattered showers and thunderstorms from the central Gulf Coast
across Florida into the southern Atlantic Coast states.
   Predicted highs: 80s or 90s across much of the nation; 70s from
the Great Lakes and middle Mississippi Valley into northern New
England, and along the Pacific Coast; 100 to 110 degrees in parts of
south-central and southwest Texas, interior valleys of California
and in the lower elevations of the Plateau region, with 110 to 120
degree readings in the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees at Laramie, Wyo., to 100 at Phoenix and Blythe, Calif.

<TEXT>
   The calamitous Alaskan oil spill could
have been avoided if efforts to steer the Exxon Valdez back into
shipping lanes had begun six or seven minutes earlier, the Exxon
Shipping Co. said.
   Exxon on Tuesday released its findings on the March 24 accident
that caused the nation's worst oil spill. The report has been
submitted to the National Transportation Safety Board.
   In a separate filing with the NTSB on Monday, the state said poor
management by Exxon led to the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of
crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   In related developments Tuesday:
   _A spokesman for Gov. Steve Cowper criticized the federal
government for its pace in estimating environmental damage from the
spill. ``We've got to get this federal process of assessing damages
off the dime so Alaskans can be fairly and promptly compensated,''
said spokesman David Ramseur.
   _Workers offshore San Diego finished sampling seawater in the
Valdez's cargo holds, and officials said it would take about a week
to determine the toxicity of oily discharges from the damaged tanker.
   Two weeks ago the Coast Guard stopped the ship from entering San
Diego Harbor for repairs after an 18-mile slick was sighted near the
tanker. State officials on Tuesday said the company must ensure all
discharges have stopped and prepare a contingency plan for handling
any pollution before docking the vessel.
   In its report, Exxon said the grounding of the 987-foot tanker
and the resulting spill were caused by a delay in turning the ship
back to traffic lanes after it was maneuvered to avoid ice.
   The level of staffing aboard the ship did not contribute to the
wreck, the crew had adequate rest to perform its work and the role
of alcohol in the accident cannot be established, Exxon said. The
company said it vigilantly told mariners they were to be sober on
the job.
   Critics have said tanker crews are too small and that crew
members work too long without rest. Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, who was
not on the tanker's bridge at the time of the wreck, failed sobriety
tests administered about 11 hours after the accident. He is to be
tried in October on felony and misdemeanor charges that include
operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   Exxon's report said the collison could have been avoided if the
ship had been turned near a navigational light about three miles
from Bligh Reef.
   The company said it has not resolved a discrepancy involving
information from a course recorder and testimony given the NTSB by
Third Mate Gregory Cousins, who was in charge on the bridge at the
time of the accident.
   Cousins testified that he issued rudder orders about the time the
ship was at the navigational light. Exxon said the vessel had been
on automatic steering and ``there was no testimony or evidence
suggesting any steering failure.''
   The company said three members of the crew consumed alcohol in
Valdez before the ship left the dock on the evening of March 23, but
two had no ``navigational or watch responsibilities which even in
the remotest sense could have contributed to this accident.''
   ``With respect to Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, the third crew member
who had consumed alcoholic beverages in Valdez, no conclusions can
be drawn that (he) was under the influence of alcohol at the time of
the grounding.''
   The tanker pilot and the crew said Hazelwood's behavior appeared
normal, but a Coast Guard officer who later boarded the ship
testified there was a strong odor of alcohol on Hazelwood's breath.
   The company said the smell of non-alcoholic ``beer'' that
Hazelwood said he drank aboard ship may have been detected.

<HEAD>Officials Emptying Tank After Underground Tunnel Leak</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DWIGHT OESTRICHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LINDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials were emptying a 12.6 million-gallon
oil storage tank today before investigating why an unsealed tunnel
leaked nearly 300 gallons of fuel oil into a New York City area
waterway.
   Coast Guard spokesman Matthew Duesing said about 2 million
gallons of oil had escaped from the tank by Tuesday evening. Most of
it was contained in surrounding dikes, or pumped into barges or a
pipeline leading to a storage system in the adjacent New York City
borough of Staten Island.
   The oil that leaked into the Arthur Kill, a narrow waterway that
separates Linden and Staten Island, was confined to a 20-by-80-foot
area, said Gary Allen, a spokesman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection. Workers were vacuuming the oil from the
water and using absorbent booms.
   ``It is free flowing oil, so it should not take more then a day
to clean up,'' Allen said.
   Officials said they expected to empty the tank by around midday
today.
   ``We won't know what caused it until the tank is totally out of
service,'' said John Reiff, general manager at the Northville
Industries plant.
   The oil that fouled the Arthur Kill came from an unsealed,
underground tunnel used to carry fuel from storage tanks to barges
and ships, Coast Guard Capt. Robert C. North said. Workers put a
makeshift clay seal at the mouth of the tunnel to cut the seepage.
   ``It wasn't sealed and why it wasn't sealed is something we are
looking into,'' North said.
   ``There's no threat to people,'' said North. ``We're concerned
about the environment if the tank should rupture.''
   The leak of No. 6 fuel oil was reported at late Tuesday morning
at the Northville plant, where four tanks sit near the edge of the
Arthur Kill.
   Reiff said the damaged tank is 18 years old and was last
inspected 7{ years ago.

   Khashoggi, the Marcoses, five other people and a California bank
were indicted in October by U.S. District Court in New York. The
indictment accuses the ousted president and his wife of stealing
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy real
estate and expensive art in New York.
   The U.S. government says Khashoggi posed as owner of some of the
assets as a cover, according to prosecutors.
   Khashoggi is charged in the indictment with racketeering,
conspiracy, obstruction of justice and mail fraud. Racketeering
alone carries a penalty of up to 20 years in prison.
   Swiss authorities said a U.S. diplomatic note asking that
Khashoggi be arrested cited four buildings in Manhattan and a
collection of paintings that disappeared from a Manila museum.

   Extremists hurled grenades at a
procession of Sinhalese and Tamil worshipers in a southern town,
killing at least 13 people and wounding about 85, police said today.
   The attack occurred Tuesday night at the end of a weeklong
religious festival in Kataragama, 105 miles southeast of Colombo,
said a police official speaking on condition of anonymity.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
   About 5,000 people had gathered for the procession, which
attracts both Sinhalese Buddhists and Tamil Hindus and is considered
a demonstration that the two communities can come together in
harmony despite the country's ethnic strife. Tamil Hindus from India
also were present.
   ``It is a tragedy beyond comparison,'' said Ranjith Madumma
Bandara, a government lawmaker who participated in the procession.
``There is nothing sacred in this country any more.''
   Bandara said two women walking beside him were killed in the
explosions but that he escaped injury.
   The Sri Lankan government imposed press censorship July 6 amid
escalating ethnic violence and a political dispute with India over
the withdrawal of Indian peacekeeping forces from the small island
nation southeast of Madras.
   In Madras, India, a Sri Lankan Tamil party blamed the attack on
Sinhalese militants from the left-wing People's Liberation Front.
   Ponnudurai Ravinesan, spokesman for the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front, said he had information from Sri
Lanka that the grenades were thrown by radicals from the Sinhalese
group.
   The front has usually attacked only fellow Sinhalese since
launching an uprising against the government in 1987. It has accused
the Sinhalese-dominated government of selling out its own people to
make peace with Tamil rebels.
   Bandara said Dharamadasa Banda, minister of state for
rehabilitation, and other Parliament members were walking with the
procession from a Hindu temple to a Buddhist dagoba when three
grenades were hurled. Banda, a Sinhalese Buddhist who is the
religious chief for the two shrines, was among those injured,
Bandara said.
   The two shrines, which are about a half-mile apart, are located
in the predominantly Sinhalese district of Monaragala. The largely
Tamil district of Amparai borders Monaragala to its north.
   Tamil guerrillas embarked on a separatist war in 1983, targeting
the predominantly Sinhalese Sri Lankan security forces and Sinhalese
civilians.
   In 1987, India attempted to mediate peace on the island of 16
million people by signing an accord with the Sri Lankan government
that was designed to give Tamils in northern and eastern Sri Lanka
some autonomy.
   Indian troops were dispatched to the island to supervise a
surrender of arms by Tamil guerrillas, but the most militant Tamils
reneged on the pact and began battling the Indians.
   The Sri Lankan government this summer opened negotiations with
Tamil militants, and President Ranasinghe Premadasa subsequently
demanded that India withdraw its estimated 40,000 soldiers by the
end of July.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India has said a premature pullout
would lead to even more bloodshed.
   Since 1983, about 14,000 people have died in the ethnic strife.
The government blames the Sinhalese extremists for about 3,500 of
the killings. The others, including nearly 1,000 Indian soldiers,
died in the Tamil insurrection.
   Sinhalese comprise about 75 percent of Sri Lanka's people. Tamils
make up 18 percent and say they are discriminated against by
Sinhalese in education, jobs and use of the Sinhala language.
   There also are small Moslem and Christian communities.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry Jr. and
Jesse L. Jackson met into the early morning today at Jackson's
hotel, as speculation continued about the former Democratic
presidential candidate's possible run for Barry's job.
   Barry, accompanied by Walter F. Fauntroy, the district's delegate
to Congress, told The Washington Post after the 90-minute meeting
that the session had been about ``faith.''
   Jackson said Tuesday that he would establish his legal residence
in the nation's capital when he moves here later this year.
   However, he sidestepped questions about whether he would run for
mayor.
   When asked whether he would end all speculation by saying
unequivocally that he would not join the 1990 race for mayor,
Jackson said: ``I will not bear the burden of your frustration.''
   Jackson would have to become a legal D.C. resident by Nov. 6, one
year before the 1990 election, to be a qualified candidate.
   He has owned a house in D.C. since 1984, but has resided in
Chicago where the Rainbow Coalition, the political organization he
founded, has its headquarters.
   The coalition is relocating to Washington, and Jackson said he
will be living her by Sept. 1.
   The Jackson-Barry meeting, which ended at 12:45 a.m. today, was
the first between the two men since Barry said through aides last
week he would seek a fourth term as mayor.
   Jackson has repeatedly stated he would not run against Barry.

<HEAD>Prominent Dissidents Arrested; 20 Executions Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two prominent dissidents were arrested, and a Hong
Kong newspaper reported today that about 20 people have been
executed for joining in pro-democracy protests.
   The Chinese-language newspaper Ming Pao said the executions took
place about 10 days ago, and that most of the group were members of
an outlawed independent workers' union set up during the protests.
   The Beijing People's High Court refused to comment on the report,
as did police. Several dozen executions are known to have taken
place since the protests were crushed June 3-4, but the authorities
have linked only 12 to the protests. Many Chinese believe the number
is far higher.
   A man who identified himself only as the husband of leading
journalist Dai Qing said Tuesday that she was arrested last week. He
said plainclothes police came to their home during dinner, said they
wanted to talk to her, searched the apartment briefly and led her
away. He said he had not heard from her since.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said a Shanghai man jailed for
two years after China's last round of student protests, in 1986-87,
was arrested again on the same charge of conducting ``demagogical
propaganda for counterrevolutionary purposes.''
   Yang Wei had been released from prison in January. Xinhua accused
him of collecting information during the recent protests for a
U.S.-based Chinese expatriate group, the Chinese Alliance for
Democracy, which seeks political reforms and which China has
condemned as reactionary.
   During Yang's first jail term, the U.S. Congress urged his
release.
   Dai's arrest was not reported in the official media.
   The officially reported arrests total about 2,060 nationwide, but
Chinese sources say more than that number have been arrested in
Beijing alone, and that more people are taken into custody each day.
   The authorities may be withholding information on arrests,
especially of leading intellectuals and student protesters, in order
to avoid further international criticism of the crackdown.
   In another development, the Japanese Embassy said Chinese police
have promised to investigate an anonymous threat to kill two
Japanese in China each month. The threat was made in a letter mailed
to Japan Airline's Beijing office and signed by a previously unknown
group, the Blood-Bright Dare to Die Squad. The group accused Japan
of colluding with ``the Communist Party dictatorial government and
(plotting) to launch a large-scale economic invasion of China.''
   Embassy spokesman Minoru Kubota said Japan's warning to its
citizens to be careful while visiting China, issued after the army
attacked the student protesters last month, still stands. He said no
further action would be taken until police complete their
investigation.
   A Public Security Ministry spokesman refused to acknowledge that
the case existed, and the Foreign Ministry did not answer telephone
queries about it.
   The Chinese government has been trying to encourage foreign
businessmen and tourists who fled during the army crackdown to
return, and has said their safety is guaranteed.
   Bo Xicheng, head of Beijing Tourism Administration, told foreign
travel agents last week that the government would pay $100,000 to
the family of any tourist ``killed irregularly'' in Beijing because
of martial law. Tourism officials said they did not know what
``irregularly'' meant.
   Also today, one of China's most popular and controversial
television programs was condemned on the front page of the People's
Daily in an essay that set the tone for the government's new hard
line.
   The six-part program, ``River Elegy,'' an analysis of Chinese
culture, was aired twice last summer to one of the biggest audiences
for any show on China Central Television. It concluded that Chinese
culture is rigid, inbred, suffocating and unable to adopt to the
modern world.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is lobbying
congressmen behind closed doors in his ``uphill battle'' to get
funding for the multibillion-dollar B-2 stealth bomber.
   Cheney took word of the plane's first successful test flight into
the first round of meetings Tuesday with lawmakers who will debate
the fate of the bomber and the overall $305 billion Pentagon budget
next week on the House and Senate floors.
   He said Monday's two-hour flight of the sinister-looking, dark
flying wing boosted chances the radar-evading plane will also dodge
congressional critics who want to stop funding the program.
   ``Having gotten it this far, it's now flying and I think we ought
to proceed with it,'' Cheney said before meeting with a group of
House Republicans. ``I think it would be a serious mistake for us to
turn our back on that system.''
   The plane, the most expensive in history, is to be dismantled and
undergo another series of tests before it is prepared for a second
flight.
   But House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., says Cheney faces
``an uphill battle'' for the weapon in the defense authorization
bill.
   The bat-like bomber, whose unorthodox design and materials makes
it tough to track with radar, carries a $500 million price tag that
has prompted ``sticker shock'' in budget-conscious lawmakers.
   Cheney calls the plane ``a first-class aircraft'' that represents
a significant advancement in technology, as well as a major
investment of $22 billion so far.
   Later in the week, Cheney is slated to meet with senators and
members of the House GOP Conference Committee over breakfast,
according to Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   The department has proposed $4.7 billion for the stealth bomber
in the fiscal 1990 budget and wants about $24 billion for the
program during a peak three-year spending period in the mid-1990s.
   Overall, the Pentagon wants to buy 132 planes for $70 billion.
   The House Armed Services Committee last month slashed $800
million from the B-2 budget. On Friday, the Senate Armed Services
Committee trimmed $300 million from the Bush administration's
request and included a series of testing requirements before the
plane could go into full production.
   Williams told reporters the successful test flight should have
changed some minds on Capitol Hill.
   ``There were many members of Congress who said they couldn't make
a decision about the B-2 until it had flown. ... Now it has flown.
... That whole question of whether it could fly is gone,'' Williams
said.
   ``It has proven it can fly and that makes a substantial
difference,'' the spokesman said.

   A woman told jurors she was gang raped by
teen-agers who kicked her husband in the face and shouted ``die,
die, die,'' while people in the neighborhood who saw the attack
refused her pleas for help.
   ``I saw a lot of people in their doors and windows, but no one
would help us. I thought I was going to be the only one to save my
husband,'' she said.
   Defense lawyer Walter Isaacson told jurors in his opening
comments Tuesday that the woman was a willing participant in sex
acts and the violence started after her husband decided ``that was
enough'' and the couple tried to leave.
   The 46-year-old woman was the first witness to testify in the
Rock County Circuit Court trial of Anthony Merriweather, 18, and
Craig Clifton, 19.
   They were among five people charged with first-degree sexual
assault and aggravated battery in the Nov. 10 attack on the couple
outside a tavern and in a surrounding working-class neighborhood in
Beloit, a small industrial city in southern Wisconsin.
   Deirick Conner, 18; Stanley Peacock, 19; and Tyree McAtee, 18,
pleaded guilty last week and face sentencing Aug. 22. The pleas came
in exchange for a prosecution promise not to seek maximum penalties.
   The woman testified she was sexually assaulted about a dozen
times by the five young men after they threatened to kill her and
her husband.
   The assaults started at the bar entrance, which was locked for
construction, she said. Her husband was pushed and punched when he
tried to pull her toward their car, she said.
   The assaults continued at a nearby house where she said she heard
one person tell her husband, ``You must not care very much about her
if you brought her here,'' and, ``She's ours now.''
   After struggling free, going outside and screaming for someone to
call the police, she said, ``I saw these guys running up and kicking
him (her husband) in the face.
   ``He was lying on his side and they'd come up and kick him. They
were saying `die, die, die,''' she said in a cracked, tearful voice.
She broke down later when shown a picture of her injured husband.
   Charlotte Golden, 17, said she was in her living room, heard
yelling and screaming outside and looked to see a group of
teen-agers ``hitting and beating on something in the middle of the
street.''
   Miss Golden said the woman ran into her front yard and screamed,
``Help me. They are trying to kill me.''
   But she said, ``I told her to get out of my yard ... because I
thought she was a prostitute.''

   U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de
Cuellar today began three days of talks aimed at resolving what he
called ``critical problems'' in a yearlong independence plan for
Namibia.
   The United Nations chief met with senior U.N. officials in the
territory. He was scheduled to hold talks with all major political
parties and Namibia's South African administrator, Louis Pienaar.
   ``I want to ensure that conditions are created that will enable
the holding of free and fair elections'' in November, Perez de
Cuellar said upon his arrival in Namibia late Tuesday night.
   South Africa, which has ruled Namibia since World War I, agreed
in December to carry out the U.N. independence plan under terms of a
regional peace accord. Under the U.S.-brokered pact, South Africa
also pledged to halt aid to guerrillas battling the Angolan
government.
   In exchange, the agreement stipulated that the estimated 50,000
Cuban troops supporting the Angolan government would be withdrawn.
   More than 5,000 U.N. personnel are in Namibia to monitor the
independence process in the territory.
   Perez de Cuellar indicated the independence plan is on track but
said ``critical problems remain.''
   He did not elaborate, but the remark was interpreted as a
reference to mutual suspicion between Namibia's South African
administration and the South-West Africa People's Organization, or
SWAPO, the group favored in the elections. SWAPO fought a 23-year
guerrilla war in an effort to drive out the South Africans.
   On Tuesday, SWAPO accused Pienaar of creating a ``war hysteria''
by claiming 1,900 SWAPO fighters were massed near the Angola-Namibia
border.
   SWAPO and U.N. officials said they found nothing to support the
claims during a visit to northern Namibia over the weekend.
   More than 1,000 armed guerrillas crossed into Namibia on April 1,
the day the independence plan took effect. The ensuing three weeks
of fighting left more than 300 guerrillas and 27 security force
members dead, and it jeopardized the independence plan.
   Perez de Cuellar is also expected to look into charges of
intimidation by the police force.
   An estimated 3,000 paramilitary police have been incorporated
into the regular police force, and SWAPO says they are harassing its
supporters.
   Perez de Cuellar was to visit several northern towns Thursday to
examine the security situation and observe repatriation of Namibian
refugees. A total of 41,000 refugees are to come home.
   The U.N. chief heads Friday to South Africa for talks with
government leaders there.

   A bomb exploded in front of a courthouse
in a northeastern city today, killing 11 people and injuring eight,
police said.
   The bomb, placed in the basket of a parked bicycle, exploded at
11:40 a.m. as the victims were descending the stairs of the
courthouse in Nakhorn Ratchasima, a police officer said.
   ``It's probably a homemade bomb with remote control,'' said the
officer, who demanded anonymity.
   He said the attack was probably related to a business dispute.
One of the businessmen involved and several of his bodyguards were
among those killed by the bomb, the police officer said.
   Three people were seriously injured, and five others suffered
less serious wounds, the officer reported.
   He said no arrests were made.
   Nakhorn Ratchasima, capital of the province of the same name, is
130 miles northeast of Bangkok.

   An 11-year-old boy collapsed while riding the
``Z-Force'' roller coaster at Six Flags Over Georgia and was
pronounced dead a short time later, officials said.
   Six Flags spokesman Bob Maxwell said the boy appeared fine when
he boarded the roller coaster with his family at 9:40 p.m. Tuesday,
but was found unconscious at the end of the ride, which includes six
sharp, corkscrew dives.
   Park personnel applied cardiopulmonary resuscitation until an
ambulance took the boy to HCA Parkway Medical Center, Maxwell said.
The boy, who showed now outward signs of injury, was pronounced dead
at 10:46 p.m., said hospital spokeswoman Mimi Salkin.
   Cobb County Police identified the boy as William D. Pope of
Talladega, Ala. An autopsy was scheduled for today.
   The roller coaster was closed as a precaution in keeping with
park and state rules, though there was no apparent malfunction,
Maxwell said.
   The roller coaster carries a warning that pregnant women and
people with heart or back problems shouldn't ride.
   The operators and other passengers on the ride were being
interviewed to determine if anything unusual occurred, but no other
injuries were reported, Maxwell said.
   The shoulder harness and lap belt were in place when the boy
returned, he said.
   ``The ride appears to be operating perfectly, but we won't take
any chances,'' Maxwell said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Quayle's Former Advisers Tell Their Side</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just as Dan Quayle was settling comfortably
into the vice presidency, several fellows who helped put him there _
campaign advisers borrowed from the Reagan entourage _ have provoked
anger in the White House by painting an unflattering portrait of his
candidacy.
   The old stories about Quayle being a lightweight, a foot-in-mouth
campaigner, and a neophyte not up to the job he sought are revived
in a new book, ``Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars? The Trivial
Pursuit of the Presidency 1988,'' by political columnists Jules
Witcover and Jack Germond.
   Derisive comments about Quayle's abilities come not from
Democratic critics, but from the GOP stable of advisers the Bush
campaign assigned to help manage Quayle _ among them political pros
Stuart Spencer, Joseph Canzeri and James Lake, all former advisers
to President Reagan.
   Their caustic assessments of Quayle's capabilities and their
problems in running his campaign paint a picture of a candidate who
needed protection from doing himself political harm.
   Canzeri told the authors that Quayle ``was like a kid. Ask him to
turn off a light, and by the time he gets to the switch, he's
forgotten what he went for.'' Canzeri said the handlers ``knew we
were going to have to script him.''
   Sometimes, the advisers said, Quayle exasperated and confounded
them by refusing to follow the script.
   The book quotes Spencer as saying that he let Quayle scrap a
prepared defense speech in Chicago once and deliver his own rambling
version so that the vice presidential candidate would foul up
publicly ``and then we'll own him again.''
   Lake told of a time when ``I just pushed him aside,'' to keep
Quayle from answering questions about his Vietnam-era National Guard
service at a time when it would have overshadowed George Bush's
convention acceptance speech.
   Longtime GOP consultant Ed Rollins, a former White House
political director, said any candid group of political people in
town would have told the Bush team that Quayle was a lightweight and
should not be vice president.
   President Bush is not happy about the characterizations.
   ``I find it offensive. I don't like it,'' he told reporters
Tuesday. ``That's the ugly side of politics.''
   Bush noted Quayle has made two trips to Latin America for the
administration, as well as heading the Space Council and
contributing to Bush's morning staff meetings.
   ``He's a good man and he deserves something better than a
post-mortem kick in the ... ankles,'' Bush said.
   Ironically, the book comes out at a time when Quayle has received
relatively favorable portrayals in several media accounts.
   Aside from an occasional gaffe _ he recently referred to
moon-traveling astronaut Buzz Aldrin as Buz Lukens, the congressman
convicted of corrupting a minor through sexual activity _ Quayle has
not embarrassed the administration.
   One former Quayle adviser who disagrees with those quoted in the
book, Mitch Daniels, said the critical picture they paint was not
true. But even if it were, he said, ``He's gone light years beyond''
that stage as vice president.
   But this image of Quayle is not widely seen outside Washington
political circles. While the capital may take him seriously, Quayle
still provides frequent fodder for the likes of late-night comics
Jay Leno and David Letterman.
   Quayle advisers acknowledge he hasn't shaken his image problem
across the nation, and the new book no doubt will stall progress on
that front.
   Quayle himself called it ``rather a cruel hoax that some of your
top advisers would speak like that behind your back.''
   The line from the Quayle camp now is some of his campaign
problems may have stemmed from his acquiescence to that very circle
of advisers.
   ``I share the blame. I could have told them to go to hell but I
didn't,'' press secretary David Beckwith quoted his boss as saying.

<HEAD>Officials Say Chinese Journalist Returned to Beijing on His Own</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese journalist who fled to Britain following
the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in his homeland returned
to Beijing because he wanted to, British and Chinese officials said
today.
   A Home Office spokesman said Xu Haining contacted the Chinese
Embassy on Monday and asked to return to China. He left the country
Tuesday after assuring an immigration officer at Heathrow Airport
that he wanted to leave, the official said.
   The spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
custom, would not comment on a report in The Daily Telegraph that Xu
turned himself over to the Chinese Embassy after veiled threats
against his mother appeared in a Chinese newspaper.
   Xu, 26, a prominent activist in the Chinese Democracy Movement
based in Hong Kong, had been granted permission June 30 to remain in
Britain for one year.
   A spokesman for the Chinese Embassy said Xu left ``of his own
free will.''
   The spokesman, also requesting anonymity, said Xu went to the
embassy July 9 seeking help to return home to be reunited with his
parents.
   ``We give our assurance that he will not be persecuted on his
return,'' the spokesman said. ``Everything will be all right for
him. He contacted the embassy himself. We did not know he was in
London until he came here.''
   Asked what reason Xu gave for wishing to leave Britain, the Home
Office spokesman said: ``I can't go into the individual conversation
that was held, but suffice it to say that he made a statement that
it was of his own volition.''
   The Daily Telegraph said Xu was escorted by officials from the
Chinese Embassy. The Chinese Embassy said a consular official
traveled with Xu to Frankfurt, where he caught a connecting flight
alone to Beijing.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified sources in Hong Kong, where Xu
had worked as a researcher for China's official Xinhua News Agency,
as saying he surrendered after seeing a newspaper advertisement that
suggested his mother might be harmed.
   The Evening Standard said the ad appeared July 10 and July 11 in
Singtao, a Chinese language newspaper published in London, and that
it said in part: ``Your mother is very grieved and worried, cannot
eat, sleep and (is) crying incessantly. In poor health. Please
speedily report your safety, otherwise consequences cannot be
foreseen. Everything will be as you wish.''
   The ad was signed ``your family,'' the newspaper said.
   The Home Office spokesman said he could not comment on where Xu
had been staying.
   ``Xu Haining was here legally, and somebody who is here legally
and holding a valid passport cannot be stopped from leaving the
country,'' he added.
   The Daily Telegraph said Xu escaped to London with the help of
the underground network that also assisted student leader Wu'er
Kaixi and university professor Yan Jiaqi, both of whom now are in
Paris.
   Xu fled China after speaking out against the Chinese leadership
following the military crackdown June 3-4 on demonstrators in
Beijing.

<HEAD>Suicide Increasing Among Elderly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The suicide rate among elderly Americans has
increased in recent years, federal statistics show.
   The suicides rate among people aged 75 to 84 jumped 21 percent,
from 20.8 per 100,000 people in 1979 to 25.2 per 100,000 in 1986,
according to data compiled by the National Center for Health
Statistics.
   During that same period the suicide rate for all Americans edged
up 5 percent, from 12.1 per 100,000 to 12.8 per 100,000.
   The figures, included in a detailed national mortality report for
1986, did not include an explanation for the increase.
   The 21 percent suicide jump among the 75-84 group was followed by
a 16 percent increase for people aged 85 and over. Their rate rose
from 17.9 per 100,000 to 20.8 between 1979 and 1986.
   For the 65-74 age group the suicide increase was nearly 11
percent, from 17.8 to 19.7 per 100,000; there was a 2 percent rise
from 16.6 to 17.0 among people aged 55 to 64.
   The figures showed a sharp 50 percent increase in the rate for
youngsters aged 5 to 14, but that rate was still so low that only a
small change results in a big percentage difference. The rate rose
from 0.4 per 100,000 in 1979 to 0.8 in 1986.
   For the 15-24 age group, suicides were up 5 percent from 12.4 per
100,000 to 13.1 in 1986.
   Other rates were 15.7 per 100,000 in 1986 for people aged 25 to
34, down from 16.3 in 1979; 15.2 per 100,000 population for those 35
to 44, down from 15.4; and 16.4 per 100,000 for people 45 to 54,
down from 16.5.

   Britain and Vietnam have agreed secretly to force
thousands of Vietnamese refugees in Hong Kong to return to Vietnam,
British news reports said today.
   The Guardian newspaper said the agreement was confirmed by
government officials in London and in Hong Kong. It did not identify
the officials.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. said without attribution in a
radio bulletin that details of the reported agreement had been
disclosed in Hong Kong.
   The Foreign Office would not confirm the report, and Hong Kong
officials refused comment.
   The Guardian said the refugees to be repatriated have been
classified as economic migrants from Vietnam rather than genuine
refugees. It said more than half the 50,000 boat people in Hong Kong
are likely to be sent back to Vietnam.
   The BBC said the reported agreement has been kept secret to avoid
provoking possible unrest among refugees in the British colony.
   The number of people fleeing Vietnam has increased in recent
years, many due to the poor state of Vietnam's economy rather than
political oppression. Many nations that have been accepting the
refugees have called for limits.
   The Guardian report quoted one source as saying the repatriations
could begin within a week. It said a meeting between British Foreign
Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen
Co Thach, on June 28 had paved the way for the agreement.
   The paper also said Britain has agreed to end its embargo on
economic aid to Vietnam and will provide various forms of assistance.
   A Foreign Office press officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity in keeping with British custom, said talks between British
and Vietnamese officials were still going on and that the granting
of British development aid to Vietnam was dependent on the
withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia.
   The press officer added: ``We have nothing to announce on the
outcome of those talks yet.''
   Robert van Leeuwen, head of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in the colony, said he has not been informed of an
agreement between Britain and Vietnam.
   Van Leeuwen also said a group of Vietnamese officials would
arrive in Hong Kong on Wednesday night to interview 300 boat people
who have volunteered to return to their homeland instead of
remaining in detention centers in the British colony.
   So far, 143 boat people have returned to their country under a
program of voluntary repatriation. Another group is expected to fly
back in about one month, the U.N. official said.
   He added that there were indications the number of boat people
volunteering to return home is increasing.

   Experts seeking victims of 19th century
cannibal Alferd Packer dug up eleven bones, probably all from the
same man, but couldn't immediately tell how the person died or if he
was eaten.
   ``We haven't found anything to date to indicate sharp implement
marks,'' said Walter Birkby, a physical anthropologist from the
Arizona State Museum in Tucson.
   The first bone, the left temporal bone from the side of a human
skull, was found Tuesday by an expedition organized by Washington
University law professor James Starrs. Others came from a foot, leg
and hands.
   Birkby said the condition of the first bones found made him
optimistic he might be able to recognize knife marks, gunshot
wounds, or post-mortem breakage of the bones that could indicate
cannibalism.
   The diggers hope to sift the truth from the legends that have
grown up around the deaths of five Utah men who went with Packer on
a gold-prospecting trip in the San Juan Mountains in 1874.
   Packer, who admitted eating his companions' remains, was the sole
survivor. The way he told it, the group got snowbound on the
9,000-foot mountain ridge in 1874.
   He said Shannon Bell, one of the party, killed the other four
while Packer was away from camp. Packer said he killed Bell in
self-defense and ate the remains of the five men to survive.
   Packer was convicted of murdering one of the prospectors, Israel
Swan, on April 13, 1883, but the state Supreme Court overturned the
sentence and when he was retried, Packer was convicted of
manslaughter.
   Packer was sentenced to serve 40 years in prison, but was paroled
in 1901. He died April 24, 1907.
   The gravesite of the five victims has been set off by a marker,
which honors the five men ``who were murdered on this spot early in
the year 1874 while pioneering for mineral resources of the San Juan
country.''
   Working in short-sleeved shirts, hiking shorts and hats, and
using common garden tooks, archaeologist Jim Ayres, Birkby and some
of their graduate students dug about 6 inches under the marker
Tuesday before locating parallel rows of rock that they speculated
marked the graves of the five men. The first bone was found a short
time later.
   Lab work will determine age, cause of death and other details the
bones may be able to provide, Ayres said. The searchers' next task
was to find if there are five separate graves or if all the victims
bones were interred in one large pit.

<HEAD>Uno Hints at Reform of Sales Tax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said in a campaign speech
today he will reconsider parts of a new sales tax that polls
indicate will cost his scandal-plagued party dearly in Sunday's
parliamentary elections.
   In her own electoral foray, Uno's wife, Chiyo, publicly
apologized for a sex scandal resulting from charges that her husband
kept a paid mistress.
   On his first campaign tour outside Tokyo since campaigns for the
upper house elections began July 5, Uno said people may feel some
``perplexity'' about the 3 percent tax that took effect April 1.
   ``If there are areas that need review, I hope to take
responsibility and correct them,'' Uno told reporters in Osaka
during a televised news conference. He did not elaborate.
   His governing Liberal Democratic Party bulldozed a tax reform
package, including the new sales tax, through Parliament late last
year. Opposition parties boycotted the proceedings, mainly in
protest over the role of the Liberal Democrats in an
influence-buying scandal.
   The scandal forced Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, to resign
June 2. Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate accused of trying to
gain influence with the government, sold stock at cut-rate prices to
politicians and bureaucrats. Stockholders made big profits after the
stock went public.
   The opposition has claimed the sales tax, which has now become a
major election issue, would create an unfair burden on low-income
households.
   In other comments on his campaign swing, Uno said he does not
foresee a major loss Sunday.
   But at a separate news conference today, Ryutaro Hashimoto, the
party's No. 2 executive, hinted at a possible alliance with the
conservative opposition Democratic Socialists if the Liberal
Democrats lose many seats, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   The Liberal Democrats are mainstream conservatives.
   Uno's own popularity has suffered after claims he paid a geisha
to be his mistress, and he generally has kept a low profile in the
campaign so far.
   In her apology today, the prime minister's wife spoke to a rally
of more than 5,000 women supporters of the Liberal Democratic Party.
``I deeply apologize for the criticism regarding my husband,'' she
told the audience.
   Uno himself has said only that he did nothing immoral. But
women's groups have denounced him, turning the sex scandal into
another major campaign issue.
   Polls indicate the Liberal Democrats, who have governed Japan for
34 years, will be an underdog in Sunday's elections for half the 252
seats in the upper house.
   The Liberal Democrats now hold 142 seats in the chamber,
including 73 not affected by this election. While it needs to win 54
on Sunday to maintain a majority, the latest poll indicated it will
capture only 33. The poll had a margin of error of five.
   The poll by the national newspaper Mainichi Shimbun also
predicted major gains for the leading opposition group, the Japan
Socialist Party, from its current 21 seats to a total of up to 70
seats.
   The predictions were based on interviews July 14-16 with 34,237
eligible voters picked at random across the country.
   In the survey, the Liberal Democrats' support rating was 27
percent, 18 points lower than in a similar poll before the last
election in 1986. Support for the Socialists climbed to 30 percent
from 13 percent.

   Budapest's Communist Party has proposed
that Oct. 23, the day the 1956 anti-Stalinist uprising broke out, be
celebrated as a symbol of popular will for democratic reform.
   The proposal was indicative of the dramatic changes in the
party's assessment of the revolt.
   Only last year there was an official ban on any public gathering
Oct. 23, causing opposition groups to cancel a planned march while
thousands of police prevented groups from forming around sites
associated with the revolt.
   The ruling Communist Party this year reversed its decades-long
official assesment of the revolt as a counter-revolution, saying it
began as a popular uprising.
   Andras Fabriczky, a secretary of the Budapest Communist Party
committee, told the official news agency MTI Tuesday that
participants in the protests that broke out Oct. 23, 1956 with calls
for greater democracy, espoused reform ideas now also embraced by
the current Communist Party leadership.
   Oct. 23, should be a day of ``national reconciliation,'' marked
jointly by opposition groups and the party, MTI quoted Fabriczky as
saying.
   The Budapest committee said it also supported proposals by
opposition groups and reform communists that a square be named after
Imre Nagy, the premier during the revolt who was executed in 1958 on
charges of high treason.
   Earlier this month, the Hungarian Supreme Court canceled all
charges against Nagy in a move amounting to his legal rehabilitation.
   Last month his remains were reburied in an elaborate funeral
ceremony attended by hundreds of thousands, and the party and
government have embraced him as a forerunner of communist reforms.
   MTI quoted Fabriczky as saying the formal naming of a square
should take place Oct. 23, as well as the laying of a cornerstone
for a monument to the memory of the ``heroes and victims'' of 1956.

   City officials have approved a ban next
year on plastic food containers, coolants, solvents and other
products containing chlorofluorocarbons that deplete the Earth's
ozone.
   According to a city ordinance adopted Tuesday, local businesses
will be banned from buying, selling or using products containing
chloroflurocarbons, or CFCs, as of July 1, 1990.
   Scientists say CFCs are destroying the Earth's ozone layer, which
screens the sun's ultraviolet rays. Exposure to large doses of
ultraviolet rays can lead to skin cancer and other diseases.
   The measure, approved by a 4-1 vote, is believed to be one of the
most comprehensive ever adopted, city officials said.
   ``We think it is the most far-reaching ordinance in the United
States,'' said Mayor Larry Agran, who proposed the measure. ``We
think it will set the standard nationally and globally.''
   Under terms of the ordinance, violators would be fined $50 for a
first offense, $100 for a second offense and $250 for each
subsequent offense. Each day of noncompliance with the ordinance
would be considered a violation.
   The ordinance also creates the job of environmental program
coordinator, a person who would work with businesses to find
alternative compounds to those containing CFCs and who would have
authority to grant exemptions to the ordinance.
   CFCs are found in such products as coolants, cleaning solvents
and plastic food containers, including plastic coffee cups. They
have already been banned in aerosol products made in the United
States.
   Companies in this city 40 miles southeast of Los Angeles that are
expected to be most affected by the ban include insulation
installers, food packagers, fire extinguisher manufacturers, air
conditioning and refrigeration repair operations, and electronics
manufacturers.
   The ordinance will not ban the use of CFCs in automobile air
conditioners and refrigerators, but it will require service stations
and repair shops to capture and recycle the compounds.
   Several representatives of businesses that would be affected
spoke out against the ordinance during a 2{-hour hearing attended by
about 100 people.
   Scott Byington, an air conditioning serviceman, said the
ordinance would increase the price of home air conditioner repairs
from an average of $60 to $200.
   ``You're going to have a flood of exemption applications,'' said
Keith Lehm, Western regional manager for General Chemicals in
Wilmington, Del., a national manufacturer of CFCs. He called the
measure overzealous and disruptive.
   Alex Sapre, corporate projects manager for Hughes Aircraft Co.
said the issue would be better left to national or international
environmental experts.
   ``CFCs are a global concern and therefore need a global
solution,'' Sapre said.
   ``If we wait until all these people take action, we might as well
kiss off the future of the globe,'' the mayor said.

   A woman charged with murder in the arsenic
poisonings of her former husband and former boyfriend and assault in
the non-fatal poisoning of her present husband made her first court
appearance today.
   Blanche Taylor Moore, 56, who was arrested Tuesday in Burlington,
waived her right to a court-appointed attorney during the brief
hearing in Alamance County Superior Court and was scheduled for a
probable cause hearing Aug. 1. She is being held without bond on the
murder charges.
   The investigation began after her present husband, the Rev.
Dwight Moore, was hospitalized May 7 because of nausea and vomiting
and his illness was traced to arsenic poisoning. Two bodies already
have been exhumed and authorities have suggested the probe could
widen to include other deaths.
   The charges against her:
   _First-degree murder in the 1973 death of her first husband,
James Taylor, filed by the Burlington Police Department. The body of
Taylor, a 45-year-old furniture refinisher, was exhumed two weeks
ago and found to have traces of arsenic poisoning.
   _First-degree murder in the 1986 death of Raymond C. Reid Sr., a
former boyfriend, in a warrant issued by the Forsyth County
Sheriff's Department. Reid, a grocer in Kernersville, signed a will
a month before he died leaving equal shares of his $68,000 estate to
Mrs. Moore and his two sons. Authorities exhumed his body and
determined that he had been poisoned.
   _Assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill in the arsenic
poisoning of her current husband, who is being treated at North
Carolina Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill, filed by the Alamance
County Sheriff's Department.
   At a news conference announcing the charges, authorities refused
to provide details of their two-month probe, or to give a possible a
motive.
   Alamance County Sheriff Richard Frye said his department has a
``short list'' of deaths that he will investigate in connection with
Mrs. Moore. But he declined to give names.
   ``We still have some follow-up to do,'' Frye said.
   Officials refused to say who owned the residence where Mrs. Moore
was arrested, how long she had stayed there, or whether she was
alone when arrested.
   ``We're just going where the investigation leads us,'' said Lt.
Steve Lynch of the Burlington Police Department.
   The charges were announced hours after an Alamance Superior Court
judge's order was filed Tuesday to exhume the body of the woman's
father, Parker D. Kiser Sr., who died in 1966.
   State medical examiner Dr. John Butts has said that Mrs. Moore's
former boyfriend and former husband died of heart failure caused by
arsenic poisoning.

   A federal official says the United States wants
decisive action by Cuba against drug-smuggling, as that country
makes overtures for a joint anti-drug campaign, including a reported
meeting with a State Department official.
   Word of the meeting between a top Cuban diplomat and Michael
Kozak, deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, came Tuesday from Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and was
confirmed today by a Cuban official.
   However, another State Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said, ``We have raised (the issue of)
narcotics with the Cubans on many, many occasions over the years.''
   ``We certainly think there's ample room for the Cubans to take
action,'' he said. ``We're looking for deeds rather than just
words.''
   He declined to accept Cuba's execution last week of four military
officials _ including a hero of the revolution _ for drug
trafficking as sufficient evidence of that country's commitment to
the war against drugs.
   The United States is waiting for such actions as ``interdicting
drugs, stopping the flow over their territory,'' the official said.
   Rangel said he was told of the meeting between Kozak and Jose
Antonio Arbesu Fraga, the new chief of the Cuban Interests Section,
by Arbesu and his assistant chief, Manuel Davis. The Cuban Interests
Section is that country's substitute for an embassy, attached
formally to the Czechoslovakian Embassy.
   The Cubans said Tuesday they ``have talked with the State
Department and told them that Cuba is waiting to see how Havana can
better establish a dialogue, because no matter what the political
differences are, no one can allow the drug traffickers to take
advantage,'' Rangel said.
   They also said they told Kozak they are ``willing to cooperate in
any international anti-drug venture,'' said Rangel, who chairs the
House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control.
   Clinton Adlum, a spokesman for the Cuban Interests Section, said
today that Arbesu, who arrived in the United States in June, ``has
visited with several officials at the State Department, including
Mr. Kozak. In these conversations ... the drug problem has come up.''
   However, Adlum said, there still is no ongoing dialogue between
the countries on cooperation in anti-drug efforts.
   ``Cuba is definitely interested in this,'' Adlum said. ``We have
always been interested in cooperation with anybody, including the
United States.''
   The State Department official said Kozak had ``met with Cuban
representatives many times over the years,'' but he declined to say
whether the specific meeting in question had taken place, or what
might have been discussed.
   One indication of possible change in the U.S. stance was the
cancellation of a closed-door Coast Guard briefing of Rangel's
committee on U.S.-Cuban drug cooperation.
   The meeting was scheduled for early Tuesday morning, but Coast
Guard Commandant Adm. Paul Yost called Rangel late Monday to cancel
it, saying ``changing developments'' were responsible, according to
Rangel.
   A Coast Guard spokesman, Lt. Cmdr Marc W. Wolfson said today,
``The admiral had to cancel the briefing because the administration
thought it would be premature to give a briefing while they're
reviewing the situation and taking a look at the circumstances in
the Caribbean right now.''
   While Wolfson declined to speculate on a possible change in U.S.
attitudes toward cooperation with Cuba, he said he believed the
State Department had advised Yost to hold off on the briefing.
   Cuban leader Fidel Castro called last week for cooperation
between the two countries to combat drugs.
   ``We need some way to communicate in this common battle,'' Castro
said in a four-hour speech to the Cuban Council of State. ``We need
to talk to the Americans about how to manage this situation.''
   He contended the United States failed to warn him of Cuban
military involvement in cocaine trafficking, saying the United
States had ``at least two names'' of military officers involved in a
cocaine-trafficking conspiracy long before contacts in Colombia
alerted Cuban officials.
   Last Thursday, one of Castro's trusted advisors, Army Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, and three other military officers were
executed for smuggling tons of drugs into the United States.
   The drug scandal stunned and embarrassed Castro and his communist
government, which for years denied U.S. accusations that Cuba was
being used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana.

   A United Airlines DC-10 with 249 people aboard
slid 300 yards off a runway after landing at rain-soaked O'Hare
International Airport, but there were no injuries, authorities said.
   After touching down Tuesday night, the pilot could not brake the
jet in time to avoid running off the runway into a grassy, muddy
area, said Lisa Howard, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Department of
Aviation.
   Flight 247, bound from Cleveland to Denver, landed in Chicago
with a crew of 10 and 239 passengers, said United spokesman Joe
Hopkins.
   Airport workers used portable staircases to evacuate the
passengers within 15 minutes, Ms. Howard said.
   O'Hare had been experiencing delays most of the afternoon due to
severe thunderstorms in the area, and the accident caused flights to
be delayed on all major carriers for up to 1{ hours, Ms. Howard said.

<TEXT>
   A man with a long history of family violence
fatally shot his 18-year-old daughter, wounded an officer trying to
rescue the woman and then killed himself, ignoring pleas from a
policeman who had persuaded him to surrender in a previous hostage
incident.
   Suffolk County police found the bodies of James Hyames, 59, and
his daughter, Lisa Fotiathis, at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in their Mastic
home.
   Hyames had argued with Ms. Fotiathis just before noon, prompting
the young woman's stepmother, Marcine Hyames, to leave the house,
said Lt. William Kiley.
   Soon after, Mrs. Hyames heard a shot, ran back to the house and
saw Ms. Fotiathis lying on the floor and her husband holding a
handgun, Kiley said.
   She ran to a neighbor's and called police, Kiley said.
   Hyames fired at the first two officers on the scene, prompting
police to surround the house and evacuate nearby homes.
   About 2:15 p.m., a team of officers stormed the house to try to
rescue Ms. Fotiathis, who they thought was still alive. Hyames fired
again, grazing the head of Officer John Keene, 32, and police
retreated, said Suffolk County police spokesman Salvatore Yovino.
Keene's wound was superficial.
   Hyames was married several times and had a history of violence
against relatives.
   In Colorado 20 years ago, he shot his pregnant wife. She survived
but lost the baby and he went to prison, Kiley said.
   In 1974, in Carlstadt, N.J., Hyames held his wife and two
children hostage for 19 hours, keeping police at bay with gunfire. A
Roman Catholic priest and Carlstadt Deputy Police Chief John
Occhiuzzo talked Hyames into surrendering, and he served time in
jail, said Lt. Herb Scheidewig of the Carlstadt police.
   He kept in touch with Occhiuzzo over the years and during
Tuesday's standoff with Suffolk police, Hyames telephoned Occhiuzzo,
told him he'd shot his daughter and that police were after him.
   Occhiuzzo then drove to Mastic at the Suffolk police's request
and tried, with relatives and others, to get Hyames to surrender or
permit police to take Ms. Fotiathis to the hospital.
   Among the relatives who spoke to Hyames by telephone at the scene
was his daughter, Carol Ianelli, who hadn't spoken to her father in
15 years.
   ``That's what he does,'' she said after her sister's body was
found. ``This is him. I'm not surprised.''
   She said he told her on the telephone that he ``shot Lisa and
she's lying in a pool of blood'' and that he was ``not going back to
jail. Life is over for me.''
   Mrs. Ianello told reporters Hyames had recently caught Ms.
Fotiathis in bed with a man.
   Hyames was also angry because Ms. Fotiathis recently sold a car
against his wishes and had moved in with a boyfriend, said Kiley and
Sgt. William Pepper.
   Pepper said throughout the ordeal Hyames was ``very adamant that
he was not coming out, no matter what.''
   About 5:30 p.m., police connected Hyames on the phone with a
grown son, Mark, in Harrisburg, Pa. A few minutes later, Hyames said
goodbye to him, hung up and a shot rang out, police said.
   Police sprayed the house with tear gas, went in and found the
bodies.
   Neighbors and relatives said Hyames had worked at various jobs,
including as a security guard and a mechanic.
   It was not immediately clear whether the Colorado, New Jersey and
Long Island incidents involved different wives.

<HEAD>Worker Claims Someone Laced His Lemonade With Radioactive Material</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A nuclear plant worker who told authorities
he purposely drank lemonade he'd laced with radioactive material now
says someone else spiked his drink.
   ``The individual who said he spiked his lemonade has changed his
story and says he did not do it,'' said Cliff Spieler, spokesman for
the New York Power Authority, which runs the James A. FitzPatrick
plant on Lake Ontario.
   The investigation of the non-sickening dose of cobalt-60 and
other materials now becomes a criminal probe, Spieler said Tuesday.
   ``I won't vouch for his new story,'' Spieler said. ``But we've
got to go on the assumption that what he is saying now would be
correct.''
   The power authority disclosed Monday that the worker, a temporary
supervisor at the plant, told his investigators of drinking the
radioactive lemonade Friday after he set off a radiation scanner on
his way home from work.
   Authorities refused to reveal the man's name.
   He was monitored to determine precisely how much radioactive
material he ingested, but he wasn't hospitalized.
   The worker gave no indication why he changed his story, Spieler
said, adding that the power authority has asked for help from the
Oswego County Sheriff's Department.
   No other plant employees have been found who saw the worker drink
lemonade, the spokesman said. The man was supervising work on the
refuel floor, an area where nuclear fuel is loaded and unloaded from
the reactor.
   Officials estimated the worker's dose of radiation at 50 to 75
millirems, comparable to the amount of radiation in five chest
X-rays.
   In addition to cobalt-60, which emits penetrating gamma rays, the
man also swallowed cesium-137 and manganese-54, Schmidt said.

   F.W. de Klerk, the politician expected
to be South Africa's next president, met President Joaquim Chissano
for talks today in the National Party leader's first official visit
to a black African state.
   In Lusaka, Zambia today, President Kenneth Kaunda told reporters
he has invited de Klerk to meet with him for talks. Kuanda, one of
Africa's staunchest South Africa opponents, said he offered to meet
de Klerk in Livingstone in southern Zambia ``on any day that is
acceptable'' to him.
   Chissano said Monday that de Klerk had asked for the meeting in
Mozambique, but the South African Broadcasting Corp. said Chissano
requested the talks.
   When a reporter asked Chissano what he hoped to achieve, the
president smiled and pointed at de Klerk saying, ``Later ... he will
tell you what he wants to achieve,'' the national news agency AIM
said.
   In Johannesburg, the state-run South African Broadcasting Corp.
said the talks would include proposals to end Mozambique's 12-year
guerrilla insurgency.
   South Africa at one time supported the Mozambique National
Resistance guerrillas, who have been accused of atrocities against
civilians in their war against the Marxist government.
   Chissano told a news conference Monday that his government no
longer believes the South African government or military support the
guerrillas, although he said ``elements'' in South Africa still
provide aid.
   The South African delegation indicated it wanted to discuss
development aid to Mozambique and improvements to Maputo harbor, the
broadcast report said.
   De Klerk's delegation, which included Foreign Affairs Minister
Pik Botha, was met at the airport by Mozambican Minister of
Cooperation Jacinto Veloso. It then toured a waterfront residential
compound intended for families of South African trade mission
employees.
   The two countries have no formal diplomatic contacts, but
relations have improved dramatically since President P.W. Botha met
Chissano in September.
   De Klerk is expected to become president of South Africa after
P.W. Botha retires following Sept. 6 parliamentary elections.
   In Lusaka, Kaunda, one of Africa's staunchest South Africa
opponents, told reporters he offered to meet de Klerk in Livingstone
in southern Zambia ``on any day that is acceptable'' to him.

<TEXT>
   Vietnam's foreign minister, Nguyen Co
Thach, said today the Vietnamese-installed government in Cambodia
should agree to a cease-fire with guerrilla forces opposing it,
official media reported.
   Also today, Prime Minister Hun Sen of Cambodia left for Paris to
attend an international conference on Cambodia starting July 30.
   Also expected at the Paris conference are the Cambodian guerrilla
factions; Vietnam and its ally, Laos; the six-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, and in their first collective attempt at
Cambodian peace talks, the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ Britain, France, the United States, China and the
Soviet Union.
   Vietnam's Radio Hanoi said Thach was asked during an interview on
Vietnamese television about a truce proposal made by Thai Prime
Minister Chatichai Choonhavan a few months ago.
   ``The Cambodian issue cannot be solved peacefully without a
cease-fire,'' Thach replied. ``Therefore, Vietnam fully supports the
Thai prime minister's proposal that the Cambodian parties sign a
cease-fire agreement in Bangkok and considers this as part of a
political solution to the Cambodian issue.''
   Hun Sen and Prince Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the three-party
guerrilla coalition, said in May they agreed in principle with the
proposal. But the Khmer Rouge, the largest and most hard-line
guerrilla force, rejected it.
   Thach also said that in recent talks in Indonesia, ``We have
formed a basis for a political solution to the Cambodian issue,''
but he did not elaborate.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted the
communist Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians and attacked Vietnamese border villages during its nearly
four-year reign.
   Vietnam says it will withdraw its 60,000 to 70,000 troops from
Cambodia by Sept. 30, whether or not there is a political settlement
in the war.

<HEAD>Officials: Body Parts Found at Illegal Dump Internal Organs, Not
Limbs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal prosecutors said the human body parts
found at an illegal waste site in Brooklyn with alleged mob ties
were internal organs and not external limbs as a published report
said.
   Law enforcement sources cited by the Daily News on Tuesday said
arms, legs and part of a torso were found at the dump in September
after a mob informant tipped investigators that trash hauling
companies were being used to dispose of mob execution victims.
   A spokesman for the city's Department of Investigation, Ron
Davis, blamed poor internal communications in the office for the
discrepancy, the Daily News said today.
   Prosecutors contradicted statements by the city's Department of
Investigation about the grisly discovery at National-Stage Carting
Co. in Bay Ridge, the newspaper said.
   Federal prosecutor Aaron Marcu declined to comment on allegations
connecting the waste disposal companies with mob hits, the newspaper
said.
   ``As we charged in the indictment, an enormous quantity of
illegally stored infectious waste was discovered in an unlicensed
tractor-trailer outside of National Carting,'' Marcu said.
   Federal and city investigators got a search warrant and found the
body parts with four tons of medical waste in a refrigerated trailer
parked on a side street near the company.
   Ben Brafman, a lawyer for the company's owner, Angelo Paccione,
said, ``These were hospital materials. Whether it was disposed of
properly will be resolved at trial.''
   The Daily News said investigators describe Paccione as a major
figure in a carting cartel controlled by the Gambino crime family.

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS year to 1988 sted 1986 in 3rd graf, That ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork told
a House panel today that the high court erred in ruling that the
Constitution protects flag burning, and the only way to turn things
around is through a constitutional amendment banning that form of
protest.
   ``The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision... that flag burning is a mode
of expression protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of the
freedom of speech seems to me plainly wrong and to rest upon
propositions that either are not relevant or that cannot be
supported,'' Bork told the House Judiciary constitutional law
subcommittee.
   That ruling might have gone the other way had the Senate in 1988
not rejected President Reagan's nomination of Bork to the Supreme
Court.
   Bork says he would have sided with the minority opinion of the
four justices who would have upheld the Texas law banning flag
burning. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, whose nomination was approved
after Bork was rejected, voted with the court majority in the case.
   Now that those decisions are history, the subcommittee is taking
testimony on whether a constitutional amendment banning flag burning
is needed, a regular statute would suffice or no remedy is required.
   Bork, a former federal appeals court judge who is now with a
Washington think tank, said the constitutional amendment approach
backed by President Bush was the only way to go.
   ``The matter cannot be cured by statute,'' he said. ``It is idle
to suppose that a constitutional ruling can be reversed by stattute
and it would be dangerous to try.''
   Also scheduled to testify today was Charles Fried, who served as
solicitor general under President Reagan. In that role, he declined
to submit a brief with the Supreme Court in the flag burning case.
   On Tuesday, Paul Kamenar of the Washington Legal Foundation told
the subcommittee his group had urged Fried to file a brief with the
court on behalf of the United States ``but to no avail.''
   ``There are some who say that if the United States had weighed in
on this case with the obvious federal interest involved, we may have
gotten the fifth vote we needed and thus would not be here today,''
Kamenar said.
   Kamenar, whose group filed its own arguments in the case on
behalf of veterans groups and others, said he supports a
constitutional amendment to turn the court ruling around.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas introduced the
Bush-backed amendment in the Senate on Tuesday, saying there was
``no guarantee'' that a regular statute would satisfy the court.
   But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a Vietnam veteran and Medal of Honor
winner, said his colleagues were jumping too quickly to push
flag-protection legislation in order to gain political capital.
   Kerrey said he at first was ``outraged'' by the court, but he
read the decision and found it appealing.
   ``I was surprised to discover... (it was) reasonable,
understandable and consistent with those values which I believe have
made America so wonderful.''
   Harvard University law professor Laurence Tribe told the House
subcommittee that the goal of the constitutional amendment could be
accomplished through a statute like one proposed by Senate Judiciary
Committee chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.
   Biden would make it a federal crime, punishable by a fine of up
to $1,000 and a year's imprisonment _ or both _ for someone to
knowingly deface the flag.
   The statute would remove all references in the existing federal
flag burning statute to ``ideas communicated'' in the process of
flag desecration and would punish only the physical act itself.
   The Supreme Court held in its 5-4 ruling in the Texas case that
desecrating the flag was protected under the Constitution's First
Amendment guarantee of free speech as far as the act of destroying
the flag was an attempt to communicate a political point of view.

   A man who crashed his truck through a
gate at the Lorimar television studio, burned the vehicle and then
killed himself may have had a business dispute with a production
company there, police said.
   ``There may be a possible business dispute involving one of the
on-lot production companies. We just don't know which one,'' police
Capt. Thomas Mahoney said after the rampage Tuesday on the lot where
the TV shows ``Dallas'' and ``Knots Landing'' are made.
   The former Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studio lot, now owned by
Lorimar-Telepictures Corp., has studios that are rented out to other
production companies.
   Police withheld the name of the dead man until relatives could be
notified. The man randomly fired six shotgun rounds, but no one was
there at the time and no else was wounded, police Lt. Jerry Dalven
said. The man turned the gun on himself when officers arrived and
ordered him to drop the weapon.
   The man drove up to a west gate at the lot shortly after 5 p.m.
Tuesday, police said. He handed a security guard two canisters of
methyl bromide gas and told the guard, ``You have five minutes to
live.''
   Officer Ed Henneberque said the gas is toxic.
   ``The guy just busted through the gates,'' said Bill McCullum, a
Lorimar security guard. ``All I know is I could have been the one
lying on the ground.''
   The driver parked the vehicle against the wall of a studio
building and apparently set it afire with a can of pressurized
lubricant, Henneberque said.
   Dave Stapf, a spokesman for the studio, said the man wasn't
believed to have been a former employee.
   ``At first, we thought it was special effects,'' said Kelly
Hustis, a truck driver at the lot. ``Then we saw the dust fly.''
   ``He didn't seem to want to hurt anybody. He stood there for a
long time telling a security guard to get back, get back,'' Hustis
said.
   The lot was not evacuated during the incident, Stapf said.

<HEAD>Iran Air Families' Lawyer Calls U.S. Offer ``Inadequate''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer representing
families of people who died when a U.S. warship shot down an Iranian
jetliner said today the United States' compensation offer is
``woefully inadequate.''
   The State Department announced Monday it will pay up to $250,000
for each full-time wage earner and up to $100,000 for each of the
others killed in the incident. It said the money would be paid to
selected intermediaries, either government or private, to make sure
it reaches the families.
   Attorney Nagib Y.A. Ghafoor said the money should be paid
directly to the families of the 290 victims rather than going
through intermediaries.
   He also noted that Iraq paid $750,000 to each of the families of
37 U.S. sailors killed when an Iraqi jet mistakenly attacked the USS
Stark in the Persian Gulf in May 1987.
   On July 3, 1988, the USS Vincennes fired missiles at what it
thought was an Iranian jet fighter flying over the Persian Gulf in
preparation for an attack. All 290 people on board the Iran Air
jetliner were killed when the plane crashed into the gulf.
   The State Department said the United States was not obligated
under international law to pay any compensation, and it blamed Iran
in part for the incident because it allowed a commerical jet to fly
over an area where a battle had been going on.
   But it recalled that former President Reagan announced eight days
after the Iran Air incident that the United States would pay
compensation in keeping with American ``humanitarian traditions.''
The proposed amounts were not announced until this week.
   Under the U.S. plan, which officials said was personally approved
by President Bush, the families to receive the money would have to
waive any further claims against the United States.
   The Stark settlement totaled about $27 million. U.S. officials
estimated the Iran Air victims' package could total $30 million.
   Ghafoor said the only difference between the two incidents was
that the Stark victims were military and the Iranian jetliner
carried civilians.
   He said the U.S. offer of ``up to'' certain amounts indicated the
United States intended to negotiate ``to minimize the amount'' of
payments.
   Iran has demanded compensation for the loss of the jet and is
suing the United States in the World Court.
   Relatives of some victims have filed a separate lawsuit against
General Electric Co., makers of the Vincennes' computerized radar
system.

   Israeli soldiers shot and killed two
Palestinians in battles with protesters in the occupied territories,
the army said today. A third Arab was reported killed as a suspected
collaborator.
   Also today, a 19-year-old Israeli woman died of injuries suffered
earlier this month in a bus crash caused by a Palestinian who
grabbed the steering wheel and forced the bus into a 200-foot ravine.
   The death of the Israel woman, a soldier, raised the death toll
in the July 6 crash to 16. On Tuesday, a 39-year-old woman hurt in
the crash became the first American to die in the Palestinian
uprising.
   In the West Bank, 20-year-old Samir al-Akhras, died after being
shot in a clash with soldiers conducting an early-morning,
search-and-arrest raid in the village of Beit Lid, an army spokesman
said.
   ``One of the forces encountered violent opposition, and in the
confrontation one youth was shot,'' said the spokesman, adding that
an army doctor tried unsuccessfully to revive him.
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers imposed a curfew on the Khan Yunis
refugee camp following nightlong clashes between troops and
stone-throwers.
   Soldiers who opened fire to quell the violence fatally shot
16-year-old Bassam Farouk Ahmed al-Jabri through the heart late
Tuesday, Arab reports said.
   An army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity in line
with regulations, said al-Jabri was shot by soldiers while he was
among youths who were hurling rocks at troops.
   Another Palestinian, 65-year-old Rizik Abdel Razak Berat, was
reported shot to death, apparently by an Arab assailant, in the West
Bank. Arab reports said his body was found in a well in the village
of Taibe and that he was slain because he was suspected of helping
Israeli authorities.
   The army said it had reports of the man's death and police were
investigating.
   More than 80 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as
suspected collaborators since the rebellion began on Dec. 8, 1987.
   In the uprising 569 Palestinians and 37 Israelis have been
killed. The protesters are trying to drive Israeli occupiers from
the territories, which Israel seized from Arab neighbors in the 1967
Middle East War.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, four Palestinian boys ages 8 to 14
suffered injuries from rubber bullets fired by troops during
stone-throwing protests today, Arab reports said.
   Another Arab man was shot and wounded by troops in the West Bank
city of Nablus, the reports said.
   The latest victim of the bus crash was identified by hospital and
army officials as Tova Maimon from the Tel Aviv suburb of Or Yehuda.
She died in intensive care.
   On Tuesday, Rita Levine, a lawyer from Philadelphia, died after
suffering serious injuries to her spinal cord and lungs, a
spokeswoman at Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem said.

<HEAD>Judge Sentences Parent to Jail for Allowing Child to Skip School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mother of a junior high school student has
been sentenced to 10 days in jail for allowing her daughter to miss
101 days of school last year.
   After sentencing Debra Shaw to the maximum jail time, District
Court Judge David W. Young then instructed a jailer to give the
woman's two children a tour of the courthouse holding cells.
   ``Your mother is going to the dirty, funky, stinky Baltimore City
Jail because the two of you have played hooky,'' Young said Tuesday.
   Young blamed the children's truancy on their mother's laziness,
noting that she had failed to show up for several meetings with
school officials before charges were filed.
   ``I don't think she's done anything to get the children to school
except to open the door and show them the way out,'' Young said.
``Ms. Shaw, as far as I'm concerned all you do is take that welfare
check, you don't do anything to help your kids.''
   Ms. Shaw was convicted on one charge of failing to send
14-year-old Shantres Shaw to school.
   Ms. Shaw said her daughter had the flu and a sore throat for the
entire month of February, when Shantres did not attend school at all.
   Young said he had information that Shantres' 13-year-old brother,
James, missed a similar number of days.
   She probably will spend about three to five days in jail before
being released, Young said. Ms. Shaw had told the judge a family
friend would watch the children if she was sent to jail.
   ``I'm going to ... follow up with the school in the fall,'' the
judge said. ``To me, it's a sin.''

   Unidentified assailants killed an army
colonel and a major and injured their driver today by spraying their
vehicle with machine-gun fire from another car and a motorcycle,
police said.
   It was the first political assassination in Spain since May and
raised to nine the number of people killed in terrorist attacks this
year.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but police said they
suspected the Basque separatist group ETA.
   The attack in Madrid occurred the day after the government of
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez formally ruled out renewing talks
with the ETA aimed at bringing an end to political violence that has
plagued Spain for 21 years.
   A police spokesman said the attack occurred at 11:15 a.m. near
the Spanish army's Madrid regional headquarters.
   The spokesman said on condition of anonymity that Col. Jose Maria
Martinez Narillo and Maj. Ignacio Varaguas were killed instantly in
the attack.
   Earlier, the spokesman erroneously reported that the driver, Cpl.
Fernando Vilches Herran, had also been killed.
   But a spokeswoman at Maranon Hospital said the soldier remained
in very serious condition with a bullet wound to the spine.
   ETA, the initials for the words Basque Land and Liberty in the
Basque language, seeks independence from Spain for the
three-province northern Basque region. It has claimed responsibility
for killing more than 600 people, mainly police, military and Civil
Guard officers since 1968.

<TEXT>
   Typhoon Gordon weakened to a tropical storm today
after roaring through the Philippines, Hong Kong and southern China.
Reports said the death toll from the storm rose to 35 people.
   Chinese television today reported five people were killed, three
wounded and at least 10 missing after Gordon hit southern Guangdong
province Tuesday afternoon. The storm left 29 dead in the
Philippines and one in Hong Kong.
   The State Meteorological Bureau said Gordon was downgraded this
morning to a tropical storm, meaning its winds were less than 73 mph.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said more than 11,000 people in
Zhuhai, on the coast of Guangdong province, were stranded and
transport was cut off between Zhuhai and Doumen, 20 miles to the
west.
   It said 80 percent of the farmland in Doumen county was flooded.
   The television news showed waves crashing over sea walls, flooded
streets and buildings with only their rooftops visible.
   The typhoon, which hit the Philippines early Sunday with 116 mph
winds, left almost 186,000 people homeless on the islands and caused
at least $30 million in damage, according to the Phillipine Office
of Civil Defense. Damage estimates from Hong Kong and southern China
were not yet available.
   The Hong Kong Observatory today said the storm was located over
Zhangjiang, on the southwestern tip of Guangdong province, at
midmorning and was headed northwest at 12 miles an hour.

<HEAD>Brady Expects Agreement Between Private Banks, Mexico</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top 9 grafs new to update with Brady testimony; picks up 7th

<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said today he
expects an agreement ``reasonably soon'' between private banks and
Mexico in the first test of his plan for reducing the $1.3 trillion
debt of poor Third World countries.
   Back from the Paris economic summit, Brady told the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress the endorsement of his plan by the
heads of state of the seven industrial powers puts pressure on
private banks to be more forthcoming in negotiating debt-reduction
agreements.
   Several members of Congress have expressed skepticism about the
workability of the plan and its reliance on government-backed
guarantees to cover interest payments to the private banks on the
remaining balances.
   The administration had sought to put some of those fears to rest,
hoping to announce at the summit an agreement in which Mexico's 15
creditor banks agreed to a 30 percent to 40 percent reduction in the
$54 billion they are owed by its government. No announcement was
made.
   ``I wish it were going faster, but these negotiations are very
complicated and take a long time,'' Brady said today. ``I think
we're going to get resolution reasonably soon.''
   ``And when we do get it,'' he said, ``I think everybody will feel
relieved that the first transaction has taken place and other ones
will follow much more quickly because we know how to do it.''
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., questioned whether private banks in
other countries were resisting the debt-reduction efforts in the
belief that their governments were not as supportive of Brady's plan
as the United States was.
   Last April, a month after the plan was revealed, it received a
qualified endorsement from the finance ministers of the six other
industrial powers _ France, Italy, West Germany, Britain, Japan and
Canada.
   Brady said the significance of the summit was that the issue has
now been ``kicked upstairs to the head-of-state level.''
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., said Tuesday the summit may have
produced a recognition by both the private banks and the Bush
administration that Brady's plan cannot work without more direct
government intervention.
   ``The banks have changed their tune,'' said LaFalce, who wants to
establish a new international agency to take the lead on deciding
how to divide losses on Third World loans which have soured.
   ``They realize that the bank advisory committees can't facilitate
it,'' LaFalce said, referring to multinational groups of commercial
bank creditors who have been negotiating debt-reduction agreements
with Third World governments such as Mexico's.
   To pressure the private banks, LaFalce and other lawmakers have
introduced legislation that would effectively cut their profits if
they continue resisting substantial voluntary reductions in what
Third World countries owe.
   At the conclusion of the summit, Bush quipped to reporters that
he was willing to put replace Brady's name with his own on the
debt-reduction plan, but not until there is more evidence it will
work.
   While the Bush administration anticipated a breakthrough during
the summit in negotiations between 15 private banks _ headed by
Citicorp of New York _ on reducing Mexico's $54 billion debt and its
annual interest payments, an accord never materialized.
   Brady's plan was based on the premise that private banks would
forgive large portions of the debt owed them by developing countries
for guarantees from government-financed multinational lenders such
as the World Bank to protect them from further losses.
   Mexico originally sought a 55 percent forgiveness of their debt
to the private banks after Brady announce his plans in March.
   The banks reportedly have offered a 35 percent reduction, but
only on the condition the multinational World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund guarantee the interest payments on the
remaining balance.
   However, the agreement between Bush and the leaders of the six
other industrial powers provides only ``limited interest support''
by their taxpayers through the IMF and World Bank ``for transactions
involving significant debt and debt service reduction.''

<HEAD>Agents Seize Alleged Kingpin Of Fish Smuggling Ring</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal agents arrested the alleged kingpin of
a fish-smuggling ring and detained the captains of two Taiwanese
fishing vessels in the North Pacific as part of a sting operation
involving the sale of $1.3 million worth of salmon.
   Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said today that a U.S. Coast Guard
cutter was continuing to shadow at least two Taiwanese driftnet
vessels about 1,000 miles north of Midway Island that were involved
in the attempted illegal sale of 500 metric tons of salmon.
   Patrick Lee of Taipei, Taiwan, was arrested late Tuesday as he
walked out of the vault of a Seattle bank carrying suitcases filed
with more than $1 million in cash, Gorman said. Two associates of
Lee also were arrested in Seattle, he said.
   Gorman said that as Lee was arrested in Seattle, the fishing
vessel Red Fin chartered by NOAA was rendezvousing with several
Taiwanese vessels in the North Pacific to complete the actual
transfer of the fish.
   When the two captains boarded the Red Fin to arrange details of
the transfer they were detained, but their two vessels fled when the
Coast Guard cutter Morgenthau appeared on the scene, the spokesman
said.
   Congressional sources, who asked not to be identified, said the
State Department had asked the government of Taiwan for permission
to board and inspect the two vessels.
   Gorman said that Lee was being charged today in Seattle with
violations of the Lacey Act, which prohibits commerce in illegally
caught salmon or wildlife. The maximum penalty would be a five-year
prison sentence and $20,000 fine.
   In addition, Gorman said the U.S. attorney in Seattle may file
additional charges and a grand jury was expected to convene there
today.
   ``We think he is the kingpin,'' Gorman said of Lee, adding that
the sting operation had taken six-months to pull off.
   ``We've arrested people in the past in salmon-laundering
operations, but we have never had an undercover operation of this
size,'' said Gorman. ``Certainly this is the first time we have been
involved in a high-seas operation.''
   He said that in addition to alleged violations of U.S. law,
Taiwan prohibits the export of salmon.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the sting operation began
early this year when Lee contacted a member of the U.S. fishing
industry with an offer to sell salmon. The American company that Lee
approached than contacted agents of the National Marine Fisheries
Service.
   Over the next six months, an agent poised as a buyer and
communicated with Lee over ``monitored'' telephone and fax machines
to arrange the sale that climaxed in Tuesday's arrests, the senator
said.
   ``This should put the lid on one of the biggest salmon-pirate
operations, and if the others have any brains, they'll sit up and
take notice too,'' said Murkowski.

   Afghan guerrillas said today they
captured 880 communist troops, including a handful of officers, when
they overran several government posts in the eastern province of
Paktia.
   The offensive was launched Sunday, but the Afghan News Agency,
which is controlled by the guerrillas and based in Pakistan, said
details of the fighting didn't reach Pakistan until Wednesday. A
second Afghan source, independent of the rebel groups in Islamabad,
confirmed the report.
   The fighting centered on posts 10 miles west of the
heavily-fortified town of Khost, 15 miles from the Pakistan border.
Many of the weapons sent through Pakistan to guerrilla positions in
Afghanistan pass through Paktia province.
   The Afghan News Agency described the fighting as ``one of the
biggest ever offensives against the communist regime troops in
Paktia.''
   The report said U.S.-backed insurgents also captured weapons and
military vehicles, including seven tanks, five of which were in
working order.
   In another report, the agency said up to 400 government troops
were killed or wounded in an attack last week on the border town of
Spinboldak in southern Afghanistan. The attack could not be
independently confirmed.

<HEAD>Authors Boast New Book is Definitive Guide to Soviet Arsenal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 5 grafs new with news conference quotes. Picks up 5th graf
pvs, Soviet nuclear.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The authors of a book released today said they
have compiled the most comprehensive guide to the Soviet nuclear
arsenal and that the Red Army's stockpile is dwindling because of
Mikhail Gorbachev's policies.
   ``We believe that the arsenal is declining, that it peaked some
time last year,'' one of the authors, Thomas B. Cochran, told a news
conference. ``They're not ahead of us and we're not ahead of them.
The fact is both can do a lot of damage to the other.''
   The book, a slick, oversized red-covered paperback entitled
``Soviet Nuclear Weapons'', claims the Soviet arsenal grew because
of ``the perception of how to achieve national security, the
advancement of certain foreign policy goals, the desire for
recognition as a superpower, domestic political struggles,
bureaucratic inertia, and military service rivalry.''
   With Soviet President Gorbachev's doctrine of ``necessary
defensive sufficiency,'' however, the arsenal is declining, the
authors say.
   ``They are and will continue in the future to get rid of their
relics, just as we did,'' Robert S. Norris, one of the authors, said
in an interview Tuesday. ``They are 40 percent larger than we are
and at first glance that's alarming, but look at why, and there's
less concern.''
   ``Soviet nuclear forces are following the U.S. pattern of the
past 10 to 20 years: certain military missions that once used
nuclear weapons began to be phased out,'' a statement about the book
said. ``The weapon was either not replaced, or replaced with a
conventional system.''
   But William M. Arkin, one of the other authors, warns: ``One
should not confuse technical obsolescence with real decisions to
remove weapons.''
   Arkin points out that a large percentage of the arsenals of both
the United States and the Soviet Union are not included in any of
the arms control negotiations.
   ``And those are the nuclear weapons that are most likely to cause
nuclear war,'' he said, adding that 14,000 of the 33,000 Soviet
warheads are not included in any of the arms talks. He cites bombs
on jet fighters, artillery and naval weapons.
   Norris said the book relied heavily on U.S. government
statistics, many of them obtained through the Freedom of Information
Act.
   ``This book seeks to put together everything we know about the
topic in one place,'' he said, pointing out the authors used
extensive footnotes to document their research.
   What is lacking, Norris readily acknowledged, is the specifics
from the Soviet Union.
   ``We didn't get any information from the Soviets,'' he said.
``The next step is to have the Soviets tell us more about out. It's
beginning to happen. We hope this book will be a lever.''
   Norris, during a recent trip to the Soviet Union, left a copy of
Soviet Nuclear Weapons for Gorbachev.
   ``We hope he'll continue what he's started to do, to bring out
more information,'' Norris said.
   The book is for experts and laymen alike, Norris said, pointing
to the numerous pictures and graphs in the 433-page book. It was
published under the auspices of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a private organization that bills itself as ``long
concerned about the dangers and problems posed by the unleashed
atom.''
   The other two authors are Thomas B. Cochran and Jeffrey Sands.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout
the country:
   July 12
   Burlington County Times, Willingboro, N.J., on Bush's trip to
Poland:
   In his two-day visit (to Poland), President Bush stepped into
situations rife with diplomatic risk and opportunity.
   He was right not to go too far _ offering relatively modest aid
while pledging support andchallenging Poles to begin transforming
their country with patience, courage, ingenuity and sacrifice.
   A key to his six-point package is a $100 million ``enterprise
fund'' to support Polish entrepreneurs.
   That kind of ecomonic incentive, plus all the symbolic support we
can offer, will help to reinforce the will of the Polish people to
break away from the hopelessness of communism and begin to forge
their own destiny.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on the S&amp;L crisis:
   Every day that passes without a bailout of the $150 billion
savings and loan mess is another $10 million in losses for which we
must pay.
   Congress has allowed more $10 million days to pass than it should
have without acting on President Bush's rescue plan. It should agree
quickly on a plan, get the bailout going, and close down ailing S&amp;Ls
before they lose more money. ...
   Bush did well in drafting his bailout. But each house made
changes _ some good, some bad. ...
   (The congressional conference committee) should accept the
House's recommendation that the taxpayers' portion of the bill be
paid out of the general budget instead of through a separate bond
sale by an independent agency.
   The House plan means increasing the deficit by $44 billion during
three years, but it would save billions of dollars in interest
payments.

   The Duluth (Minn.) News-Tribune on attempts to balance the budget:
   Just because President Bush vowed back when he was candidate Bush
that the words ``new taxes'' would never cross his lips, Congress is
looking for new ways to raise money that don't look like taxes.
   So our nation's leaders ponder hikes in the tax on tobacco and
snuff while discarding the idea of raising cigarette taxes. And
lawmakers look at repealing a tax break on employee stock ownership
plans, but won't consider hiking the gasoline tax.
   If the important task of moving toward a balanced budget requires
new income, members of Congress and George ``no new taxes'' Bush
should consider all possible sources _ not just those that pass the
duck test (if it looks like a duck, it's a duck; if it looks like a
tax, it's a tax).
   But we have an even better idea before Congress and the executive
branch leap upon the back of some poor revenue source that doesn't
look like a tax-collecting duck. Why not try cutting spending first?

   Anderson (S.C.) Independent-Mail on the U.S. Supreme Court:
   The founding fathers never intended that the Supreme Court would
be the branch of government that made everything right. The court is
intended only to be the last resort on interpretation of law.
   The most important law the court must interpret is the
Constitution. Yet, even in fulfilling that function, it is not the
duty of the court to nail new amendments onto the Constitution
simply because wise men and women think they are needed to achieve
justice.
   It is true that in interpreting the law, justices have some
latitude to construe the law broadly or narrowly. But, essentially,
the duties of the court are technical, relying on the legal
scholarship to come to an informed, lawyerly judgment about what the
law, enacted by others, means when applied in very specific cases.
   The recent decisions of the Supreme Court suggest to us that the
court is groping to return to the original function envisioned for
that body by the founding fathers.
   Legislative bodies made up of elected officials, not the court,
are supposed to make laws. But if the laws are within the
permissible bounds defined by the Constitution, narrowly
interpreted, the Supreme Court seems to be saying that it will not
throw out even stupid laws.
   After all, democracy requires that voters who elect stupid
legislators should live with the results.

   Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail on speaking fees for members of
Congress:
   President Bush has called for an outright ban on speaking fees
for congressmen and senators beginning in 1991. A new study by
Common Cause shows why this is a good idea.
   In all, 64 companies or lobbying groups spent $20,000 or more for
honoraria to congressmen and senators in 1987.
   The Tobacco Institute led the league with $123,400, followed by
the National Association of Broadcasters at $113,500. ...
   Most of the money goes to the leaders of the House and Senate,
the folks who set the congressional agenda. ...
   This money isn't passed out in the civic-minded spirit of
providing lawmakers with a forum for discussing the issues of the
day. Lobbyists get plenty in return; look at laws covering the
tobacco, television, banking, trucking and defense industries.
   Honoraria represent the legalized bribery of members of Congress
and should be banned. Congress belongs on the public payroll, not
the payrolls of special interests.

   The Phoenix Gazette on the Helmsleys:
   ``The rich are different from you and I,'' author F. Scott
Fitzgerald once said to Ernest Hemingway. To which Hemingway
supposedly replied, ``Yes, they have more money.''
   There may be other differences.
   Leona Helmsley, the self-proclaimed ``Queen'' of the hotel empire
sheand her wealthy husband own, is on trial in New York for tax
evasion in using $4 million in company money to renovate her estate
in Greenwich, Conn., and claiming it as business expenses on her tax
return.
   In testimony the other day, her housekeeper testified that she
once told Helmsley, ``You must pay a lot of taxes.'' She said
Helmsley replied, ``We don't pay taxes. Only the little people pay
taxes.''
   Obviously there was a little semantic problem here. Helmsley was
describing her behavior, not stating the law. The jury will be happy
to correct the Queen's English.

   The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel on the Seabrook nuclear power plant:
   There's really only one word that characterizes the history of
the Seabrook nuclear power project: incompetence.
   The advocates of nuclear power and the defenders of Seabrook have
tended all along to brand critics of the plant as irrational
anti-nukers. It's a false characterization.
   Those who worry about Seabrook are, for the most part,
level-headed people who have every reason to believe _ judging by
the plant officials' own behavior _ that something terrible may well
go wrong.
   Given the history of this turkey, there's nothing irrational

   The Daily Union, Junction City, Kan., on the moon landing
anniversary:
   The tax dollars spent on the U.S. space program have been subject
to debate from time to time as to its worthiness and place in the
national budget.
   We believe a space exploration budget deserves to be part of our
nation's expenditures.
   The technological gains made through the development of the space
program are too numerous to mention. The advantages space affords
man to see his fragile planet from another perspective is worth the
price alone.
   But perhaps the space program fulfills one of man's greatest
needs. That is to explore the unknown, to learn about our
surroundings and to turn that knowledge into something for the
common good of all.

   Vicksburg (Miss.) Evening Post on response to oil spills:
   If anything good can be said to come from the three recent oil
spills, it was government's quick and effective cleanup response.
   What happened in Rhode Island _ and in Delaware and Texas _ was
in dramatic contrast to the spill in Valdez ... when Exxon
ploddingly presumed to clean up after itself. ...
   The success and speed of response to the Rhode Island spill
indicates that cleanup is better coordinated by government hands
than the slow, sticky hands of the oil industry.
   If the government had delayed action as usual, to determine the
fault, the resulting enviornmental damage to the sensitive marsh
areas surrounding Narragansett Bay would have been more severe.
Instead, it was a case of cleanup first, fault and fines later. That
should be the prototype for subsequent spills.
   Prompt cleanup, however, was not enought for Delaware Gov.
Michael Castle, who was ``more interested in prevention than
response.'' Castle has a point.
   While government efforts to contain the dregs, plus the oil
industry's recent announcement of a multimillion-dollar
spill-response program are both commendable, making sure these
messes don't happen in the first place is still the key.

   Los Angeles Times on offshore oil drilling:
   There will be considerable debate in the U.S. Senate soon over
the level of oil imports. But once the rhetoric is over, senators
can vote with a clear conscience for a one-year moratorium on oil
exploration and production in the outer continenal shelf, including
the entire California coast. ...
   The House-approved moratorium obviously comes in reaction to the
Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska in March and more recent tanker
spills in the East.
   Critics claim the legislation is overkill, since offshore oil
production does not necessarily lead to tanker spills.
   But oil in the water is oil in the water. The year's delay may
finally force Congress and the administration to honestly weigh the
benefits of offshore oil production against the liabilities within
the context of a real energy policy. ...
   There will be more time to consider replacing dirty oil with
cleaner-burning natural gas. Officials can factor in the oil savings
from the use of alternative fuels in autos, as proposed in the
president's amendments to the Clean Air Act.

   Peninsula Daily News, Port Angeles, Wash., on military
procurement:
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney understands where the real military
savings can be found. That is in procurement. Defense buying will
account for more than $60 billion of this year's $305 billion
defense budget.
   The problem, of course, is how to get at those potential savings.
Any number of Defense officials before Cheney have tried to
streamline the procurement process, and failed.
   It is the Gordian knot of the Defense establishment. And, as
Cheney noted ... in calling for reform, Alexander the Great's fabled
single-stroke solution _ simply cutting the knot _ does not apply to
this 20th century problem.
   Cheney says he has no ``quick fix'' for streamlining the
Pentagon. But he does have a complex plan to overhaul the
weapons-buying bureaucracy. And he hopes to achieve some $30 billion
in total savings by the 1993 fiscal year.
   Whether or not that is a realistic expectation is anybody's guess.
   It is important that Congress cooperate, because defense budgets
are certain to decline in the years immediately ahead. The only way
to keep the nation's defense capabilities from declining as well as
to spend more carefully.

   Chronicle-Tribune, Marion, Ind., on flag burning:
   Monroe County Sheriff James Young says a U.S. Supreme Court
decision isn't going to stop him from arresting people who burn the
American flag.
   Young has told his deputies to continue arresting people who
deface the flag. He based his policy on two theories:
   _That flag burning fits the definition of disorderly conduct
under Indiana law.
   _That desecrating an American flag violates the First Amendment
freedom of expression of U.S. citizens who revere the flag as a
symbol of their country.
   Young believes he's on solid ground with the disorderly conduct
law because few public acts provoke a more violent response than
defacing an American flag. ...
   Young also defends his policy on constitutional grounds, arguing
that the flag is a ``collective expression'' of public patriotism
that should be protected under the First Amendment. ...
   Young may be stretching the point a bit too far. But the U.S.
Supreme Court also has been known to do that occasionally.

<TEXT>
   Israel's deputy finance minister
and a senior PLO official held secret, indirect talks in this city
last month with a former Dutch official acting as intermediary,
Dutch and PLO officials said today.
   Abdullah Hourani, a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's executive committee, held ``indirect and triangular''
talks on June 26 with Yossi Beilin, the deputy finance minister,
according to the PLO's representative in the Netherlands, Afif
Safieh.
   On Thursday, Beilin said on Israeli Army radio that ``clear and
official'' _ albeit ``indirect'' peace talks _ were under way
between the PLO and the Israeli government. He did not give details
or say whether he was involved.
   The Israel government considers the PLO a terrorist group and
bans its citizens from direct contacts with the organization.
   Max van der Stoel, who was Dutch foreign minister from 1973-77
and from 1881-82, acted as a go-between for the talks in this
diplomatic capital, Safieh told The Associated Press.
   A Dutch Foreign Ministry spokesman, Peter van Vliet, confirmed
Van der Stoel's role in the Israeli-PLO contacts but would give no
further details.
   ``We were kept informed by van der Stoel, but this is no
initiative of the Foreign Ministry,'' van Vliet said.
   Safieh also declined to discuss the substance of the talks.
   Van der Stoel was not immediately available for comment.
   Amsterdam's De Volkskrant newspaper quoted van der Stoel as
saying, ``I have tried to find out clearly what the bottlenecks are,
the differences of opinion, and where there are possibilities for a
beginning of understanding.''
   According to the newspaper, Beilin and Hourani had planned to
issue a joint statement after the daylong talks, but their plan fell
through because of mounting tensions in the Israeli government
coalition.
   Beilin is a member of Israel's left-of-center Labor Party and a
close political ally of Finance Minister Shimon Peres. The finance
minister has proposed a Mideast peace conference which would involve
Israel, its Arab neighbors, and Palestinian representatives.
   Earlier this month, Labor threatened to leave Israel's coalition
government after Premier Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likud bloc
bowed to conservative preconditions on his proposal to hold
elections in the Israeli-occupied territories. One stipulation was
that the 19-month Palestinian uprising must end before voting occurs.
   ``We hope that this news will not be exploited in the
intra-Israeli domestic debate,'' said Safieh, who also claimed that
``Likud, through a variety of channels, has also been communicating
with the PLO leadership.'' He refused to give details.
   Safieh described van der Stoel's role in the talks as ``trying to
bridge existing gaps between the two parties,'' and he said the
three officials had held ``more than one meeting'' during the day.
   According to Safieh, Hourani was in the Netherlands for a
conference of the World Peace Council, a private peace group. Beilin
was reportedly holding unrelated talks at the Finance Ministry.

   The 20th anniversary of Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy's traffic accident was marked here today by the
usual curiosity among tourists to the island.
   ``It's the same all the time,'' said Alison Siok, a summer worker
on the four-car ferry between this bucolic island and Martha's
Vineyard. ``People are always curious. I'd say six out of 10 people
ask about it.''
   Ferry officials say that amounts to about 50 tourists a day in
the peak summer months.
   Edgartown Police Officer Paul Condlin said today that despite the
publicity surrounding the anniversary of the accident, he hasn't
seen an increase in the number of tourists asking directions to the
now-closed wooden bridge.
   ``Every year we have the same thing,'' Condlin said.
   A passenger in Kennedy's car, 28-year-old Mary Jo Kopechne, died
July 19, 1969, after the car plunged off the narrow bridge.

   An explosion ripped through a small
apartment building today, injuring eight people who apparently
didn't hear or ignored officials' warnings to leave because of a
natural gas leak, authorities said.
   The blast at the public housing project occurred more than 90
minutes after a car ran into a gas meter and workers were unable to
shut off the gas quickly, authorities said.
   Some of the injured people were trapped in rubble for up to four
hours as workers tried to free them while not disturbing the
wreckage, authorities said.
   ``It was a bad situation. It's almost like pickup sticks. You
never know which one is going to cause the rest to collapse,'' said
Fire Chief Don Werner.
   Workers searched through debris of the two-story brick building
in the Sawyer Manor complex to check for any other possible victims
but said they didn't expect to find anyone else.
   Hospitals reported receiving eight injured people, including four
in critical condition.
   Assistant Fire Chief Neil Mills said he had no idea why anyone
was in the building at the time of the explosion. The building had
three apartments, plus a community center and offices.
   ``They had told them to get out of the bulding, but people were
going in and out,'' he said. ``You know how people are. They take a
chance to save a little bit of something.''
   When the blast occurred at 3:45 a.m., attempts still were being
made to find the proper wrench necessary to turn off a high-volume
gas line.
   ``Normally it would be shut off at the meter,'' Werner said.
``Well, the car's sitting on top of the meter.''
   Police Sgt. Mike Dailey said authorities were first called to the
scene on a report of a disturbance, which may have involved drivers
trying to ram another car. Somehow, one car hit the gas meter behind
the apartment.
   He said he did not know whether there had been any arrests.
   The force of the blast showered the area with glass and broke
windows in surrounding buildings in the project.

   Former major-league pitcher Donnie Moore,
despondent over his failing career and marital troubles, shot his
wife numerous times before killing himself, police said.
   ``All indications are that Donnie Moore and his wife, Tonya,
became involved in an argument, and during the argument, Mr. Moore
produced a handgun, shot his estranged wife and then turned the gun
on himself,'' Anaheim Police Lt. Marc Hedgpeth said.
   Tonya Moore, 35, suffered at least three gunshot wounds in the
upper chest and stomach, Hedgpeth said after the shooting Tuesday
afternoon at the couple's home in the affluent Peralta Hills area of
Anaheim.
   Their 17-year-old daughter drove her wounded mother to nearby
Kaiser Permanente Hospital. Mrs. Moore was originally in critical
condition but had improved to serious condition by this morning,
said hospital spokeswoman Donna Donan-Drasner. The spokeswoman
declined to elaborate.
   The couple's two sons, age 7 and 10, were at the house during the
shooting along with their older sister. None of the children was
hurt.
   The 35-year-old Moore, formerly with the California Angels, was
released last month by the Kansas City Royals' minor league team in
Omaha. He had been plagued by injuries during his last years in the
majors and saw yet another comeback attempt dissolve when he was
released by the Royals' organization.
   He also had separated from his wife of 16 years about a month
ago, said Moore's New York-based agent, Dave Pinter.

Sailor</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 3rd graf with Cheney declining to comment

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Navy investigation into the explosion that
killed 47 sailors on the battleship USS Iowa in April has found
strong evidence that a suicidal sailor set it off, according to two
reports.
   The 10-week probe, with FBI assistance, ruled out unstable
gunpowder or flaws in the mechanical or electrical systems in the
gun turrets where the explosion occurred, said NBC News and today's
editions of The New York Times.
   The network cited unidentified Navy sources Tuesday; the
newspaper quoted officials in the Pentagon and Congress who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today refused to
comment on the reports, saying he hasn't seen the final report of
the Navy investigation into the blast.
   The unreleased Navy report said Gunner's Mate Clayton Hartwig,
25, may have been responsible for the blast, according to NBC and
the Times.
   Navy spokesman Lt. Greg Smith told The Associated Press that the
conclusion of suicide ``was not based on official reports of the
Navy. It is the opinion of NBC and Mr. (Fred) Francis,'' the network
reporter.
   Other Pentagon officials told the newspaper the Navy had been
reluctant to issue a report, fearing it would further demoralize the
ship's crew and bring on legal action, bad publicity or charges of
incompetence or cover-up.
   Smith said the investigation report had been submitted to the
commander of surface forces for the Atlantic Fleet in Norfolk, Va.,
and eventually would land on the secretary of defense's desk.
   The investigators based their findings on a psychological profile
of Hartwig by the FBI and 228 other exhibits, including a three-hour
videotaped statement from another Iowa sailor, David Smith, NBC said.
   David Smith rejected Hartwig's sexual advances the night before
the explosion, he was quoted as saying in an interview with an
investigator.
   He also said Hartwig had discussed how to set off a bomb using a
nine-volt battery and a small timer, NBC reported.
   The two men talked about ``explosions, that kind of stuff. How to
set off the powder. All that kind of stuff,'' David Smith was quoted
as saying.
   Hartwig took him to his locker and showed him a timer, NBC
reported.
   ``Part of me can see him doing it,'' David Smith was quoted as
telling investigators.
   In addition, a psychiatric study done by the FBI Center for
Analysis of Violent Crimes found that Hartwig was disturbed and
under a lot of stress, ``virtually insuring some type of reaction.
In this instance, it is suicide,'' according to the report.
   Naval investigators also pointed to the rejection of Hartwig by
Gunner's Mate Kendall Truitt, who survived the explosion. Hartwig
had named Truitt as the sole beneficiary of a $50,000
double-indemnity life insurance policy.
   Asked about NBC's report Tuesday night, Hartwig's father, Earl V.
Hartwig of Cleveland, said there was ``no way, definitely'' that his
son was suicidal.
   Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina of Cleveland, said her brother
was not a homosexual and that 17 of his letters had been reviewed by
a team of psychiatrists who decided he was a ``normal, healthy young
man.''
   In NBC's report, David Smith was quoted as telling the
investigator he didn't immediately report what he knew because he
was scared others would think he, too, was homosexual.
   ``I could see my name labeled on every newspaper across the
U.S.A. that two gays had a fight, and I could see my life going down
the toilet right away,'' he said.
   Previous news reports indicated that at one point investigators
focused on Truitt as well as Hartwig. Truitt's attorney, Ellis Rubin
of Miami, said last month that Naval Investigative Service agents
had apologized to his client for news leaks suggesting Truitt was
involved in the explosion.
   ``The Navy is up to its old tricks of releasing selected parts of
an investigation to a favored media source and hence to the entire
world,'' Rubin said Tuesday night. ``The first victim was Ken
Truitt. Now, the victim is Clayton Hartwig, his memory and his
family.''
   The Iowa is on a six-month deployment to the North Atlantic and
the Mediterranean.

   A former high-ranking Senate aide from
Alabama pleaded guilty today to a charge of aggravated sexual
battery and was placed on probation with orders to get treatment for
psycho-sexual disorders.
   Circuit Court Judge William L. Winston sentenced Quentin C.
Crommelin Jr. to 10 years in prison, but the judge suspended the
sentence, placing Crommelin on probation for five years and making
mental therapy a special condition of the probation.
   Crommelin, 42, a native of Wetumpka, Ala., was a top aide to
conservative senators and was appointed Republican counsel for the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1987 by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., a post Crommelin held until June 1988.
   He was accused of a sexual attack on a 20-year-old Senate intern
five months later after he left the committee post.
   Barry Heitin, an Arlington County prosecutor, told the court
today that the commonwealth of Virginia was prepared to prove that
Crommelin had sexual contact with the woman by ``force, threat and
intimidation'' in his Arlington apartment on Oct. 30, 1988.
   The woman told reporters after the sentencing that she was
``happy this is over with,'' but refused to comment on whether she
thought the sentence was appropriate.
   Crommelin did not comment to reporters after the proceeding.
   Crommelin resigned in June 1983 as a top aide to then-Sen. John
East, R-N.C., shortly after District of Columbia authorities decided
not to prosecute him following an investigation into allegations of
sexual misconduct.
   He was appointed by Helms as minority counsel for the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in August 1987. He resigned that post in
June 1988.
   Previously, Crommelin worked as an aide to the late U.S. Sen. Jim
Allen, a conservative Alabama Democrat, and former Sen. Harry F.
Byrd, I-Va.

   The ashes of Laurence Olivier will be buried in
Westminster Abbey among monarchs, prime ministers and great artists
of past centuries.
   The Very Rev. Michael Mayne, dean of the church where England's
kings and queens are crowned, said a public memorial service for the
actor would also be held in the abbey this autumn.
   No date for either event was announced, but Mayne said the burial
and placement of a memorial plaque would be some time after the
memorial service.
   Olivier, 82, died July 11.
   Two of the great actors with whom he was frequently compared,
David Garrick and Henry Irving, are buried in the abbey.
   Among other famous tombs in the former monastic church are
Geoffrey Chaucer, author of the ``Canterbury Tales''; the
lexicographer Samuel Johnson; the playwrights Ben Jonson and Richard
Brinsley Sheridan; and poets Robert Browning and Alfred, Lord
Tennyson.
   William Shakespeare is among the artists honored by a monument in
``Poet's Corner,'' but is not buried in the church. Others so
honored include John Milton, William Wordsworth, Charles Dickens,
Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen, T.S. Eliot, and Emily, Anne and Charlotte
Bronte.

   The first private taxi service since
economic reforms began has gone into service in Vietnam's Ho Chi
Minh City, according to Radio Hanoi.
   The Saigon Taxi Co., whose cars are equippped with air
conditioning and radio-cassette players, was commissioned July 10,
Radio Hanoi said Tuesday.
   ``This is the first private passenger car service ever set up in
Ho Chi Minh City following the application of the multisectorial
economic policy by the state,'' it said.
   It said the company was talking with authorities at Tan Son Nhat
Airport about servicing foreign customers.
   Ho Chi Minh City was called Saigon when it was the capital of the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government, which fell to communist forces
in April 1975. In December 1986, the Communist Party endorsed for
nationwide application Western-style reforms including limited
private ownership and free enterprise.

<TEXT>
   Riot police fired tear gas to disperse
students who had gathered to hear an address by a maverick
legislator opposed to President Robert Mugabe's ruling party.
   About 5,000 students attended the meeting Tuesday night in the
main public hall on the campus of Zimbabwe University organized by
Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement, student leaders said.
   Rioting broke out when police asked Tekere to end the meeting and
students were filing out of the hall chanting slogans at police
surrounding the hall, they said.
   Some students hurled stones at advancing lines of riot police,
said a student leader who requested anonymity.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests but
ambulance crews aided students affected by tear gas.
   Students said police chased rioters and fired tear gas canisters
into campus dormitories.
   Tekere and his aides left the campus before the disturbances
started.
   A police spokesman said police began withdrawing from campus soon
after dawn Wednesday. Most students reported for classes by noon
Wednesday, school authorities said.
   The meeting was the first public gathering addressed by Tekere
since he formed his opposition party on April 30.
   In May, police cited public order regulations as the reason for
banning a public rally planned by the new party in Harare. Tekere
canceled a second meeting when his supporters found themselves
locked out of a stadium where it was to take place.
   Tekere, 52, who helped found the ruling party in 1963 and became
one of Mugabe's staunchest allies, was fired from the politburo and
central committee last October.
   He was dismissed after he denounced widespread top-level
corruption.
   Forming his opposition party in April, Tekere promised to root
out corruption and vowed to prevent Mugabe from establishing a
one-party state in one of Africa's few Western-style democracies.
   Tekere claims the broad support of students, labor leaders and
peasants in the countryside who are disenchanted with corruption,
record unemployment, shortages of basic commodities and inflation.

   A compassionate airline pilot made an
unscheduled landing because one of his 17 passengers desperately
needed a restroom, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The Twin Otter aircraft used on some routes by the domestic
airline Wideroe have no lavatories. A woman on a flight Sunday
convinced the pilot that her situation was critical, according to
the newspaper Verdens Gang.
   ``The woman was desperate,'' pilot Oeystein Sund said. ``I saw no
alternative but to land ... but I've never experienced anything like
it in my 11 years with the company.''
   The plane was on a 1-hour, 25-minute flight from Trondheim to
Mosjoen when it landed at tiny Namsos airfield, the newspaper said.
The passenger was not identified.
   A Wideroe spokesman said the extra service cost at least $430
``but I'm sure it was necessary.''

   An Egyptian trying to smuggle heroin through

Wednesday.
   The 25-year-old man, who was not identified, was in a coma for

   Blood tests conducted while the man was in the coma ``proved that

   During an autopsy, police found heroin wrapped in four small
plastic bags.
   An investigation showed the drug was being smuggled to Egypt via
Jordan, Zoubi said.
   Authorities say Jordan does not have a drug problem and that 90
percent of drug trafficking cases involve Jordan as a transit point
for narcotics smuggled from Turkey and Lebanon to ``Arab markets.''

   President Bush today gave congressional leaders
a review of his trip to Europe, and House Speaker Thomas Foley
predicted Bush will win approval for his promised $125 million in
new aid to promote free enterprise in Poland and Hungary.
   The president also voiced opposition to a proposal in the Senate
that would restrict official U.S. contacts with representatives of
the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Foley, speaking to reporters outside the White House following
the 75-minute meeting, predicted that Bush's aid package for reforms
in the Eastern Europe nations ``generally will receive strong
support.''
   He said Bush and the lawmakers did not discuss the space
initiative the president may announce Thursday, the 20th anniversary
of the first moonwalk. But the speaker said the sentiments Bush has
expressed previously that any space initiative ``has to be fiscally
responsible.''
   Foley said, ``The consensus of all those present was that (Bush)
had a very successful trip'' in both Eastern Europe and at the
economic summit in Paris. ``He deserved congratulations, which he
received.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee, said he was ``very delighted to see the president's
enthusiasm as to what's happening in Eastern Europe and his desire
to take whatever initiatives we can'' to help change the communist
economic and political systems there.
   ``That was most encouraging. There's a lot more enthusiasm than
we saw on that three or four months ago'' from the Bush
administration, said Bentsen, who added that he ``certainly will''
support the aid for Poland and Hungary.
   Both houses of Congress are now considering the administration's
overall $14.4 billion foreign aid package. A House appropriations
subcommittee late Monday earmarked $15 million for Bush's initiative
in Hungary.
   Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., the ranking minority member of the
Finance Committee, said it was hard to get any foreign aid through
Congress.
   But he called the aid proposals for the two Warsaw Bloc countries
``a very modest package. I think it's well worth giving them the
encouragement. ... You're wise to start out modestly until you see
if the reforms really come to fruition.''
   On another topic, Packwood said the PLO amendment the Senate is
considering would, in Bush's view, ``simply shut down the
negotiations. He was quite strong on that issue.''
   The amendment, co-sponsored by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
John F. Kerry, D-Mass., would bar negotiations with any PLO
representative unless the president first certified to Congress that
the representative had not played any role in terrorist activity
that resulting in the death, injury or kidnapping of American
citizens.
   Bush returned home Tuesday to a military honor guard and the
cheers of his Cabinet and a large crowd gathered on the South Lawn
of the White House.
   Bush was clearly tired from the grueling 9,000-mile journey
across four nations, but ebullient.
   ``Everywhere, in Warsaw, Gdansk and Budapest, among the leaders
of the summit nations, in the Netherlands, I found an enormous
amount of excitement,'' he said. ``Everywhere people seem to sense
that we live at a moment when positive change is possible.''

   The American Adoption Congress on Wednesday
kicked off a march to Washington to urge the opening of adoption
records, which are sealed in 47 states.
   Marchers gathered at the Bureau of Vital Records in Manhattan,
where an adopted person, her adoptive mother and her biological
mother each applied for the adopted person's original birth
certificate.
   All three applications were refused, said Don Humphrey, legal
counsel to the congress.
   In New York state, Humphrey said, records are sealed upon
adoption and cannot be opened without an application to the court
where the adoption occurred.
   ``Those applications are almost never granted,'' he said, adding
that New York's law is similar to that in most states that have
sealed records.
   Six marchers planned a 250-mile trek through New Jersey,
Pennsylvania and Maryland to an Aug. 5 rally in Washington.
   The American Adoption Congress, based in New York, is an
international, non-profit network dedicated to promoting changes in
adoption laws, policies and attitudes.

   A Korean Air Lines supervisor agreed in 1983
that a navigation mistake by the crew of ill-fated Flight 007 led to
the shootdown of the plane by the Soviet Union, an analyst who
studied the tragedy testified today.
   Frank Houston of Seattle told a U.S. District Court jury that
KAL's chief trainer of pilots, Yoon Bae Kim, ``agreed by shaking his
head in the affirmative'' about the idea that the plane had been
off-course almost from the minute it took off from Anchorage, Alaska.
   Houston and Kim were among a group of aviation experts who looked
into the shootdown over Soviet territory, which killed all 269
people aboard the plane.
   Houston said he and other members of a team ran tests in a
simulator at Boeing facilities in Seattle based on the available
flight data about the jumbo jet that was destroyed by a Soviet
fighter plane on Sept. 1, 1983.
   The team of analysts concluded that the KAL crew probably had
punched into the plane's computerized navigation system the wrong
number for the longtitude before taking off from Anchorage, Alaska,
for Seoul, South Korea.
   ``It's like a touch-tone telephone; what they did in my opinion
is misdial,'' Houston said in describing the device the crew used to
program the navigation system aboard the plane.
   The plane was estimated to be 300 miles off course when it was
shot down by Russian military aircraft. The simulator tests with the
longtitude number off by 10 degrees placed the craft in the location
it is believed to have gone down inside Russian waters.
   Houston's characterization of Kim's views is important to the
civil suit in which families of 138 of the dead passengers allege
willful misconduct by the airline.
   On Tuesday, an attorney defending KAL said Flight 007 was on
course until only a short time before it was blown out of the sky.
   George Tompkins disputed the international investigation of the
incident in which Houston participated. That probe found the plane
was significantly off course for hours before it was destroyed by
the Soviet Union.
   Tompkins refused to concede the KAL jumbo jet was off track so
early. The best evidence is that the crew was flying its correct
route until shortly before it was destroyed, he said.
   Tompkins said the crew sent radioed position reports periodically
to Anchorage and Tokyo pinpointing the plane's location as being on
course for the first four hours of its flight.
   U.S. air traffic controllers who tracked the earliest parts of
Flight 007 before it went out of radar range reported nothing
abnormal, Tompkins said.

   The Senate voted Wednesday to name a grassy

Park'' in honor of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   In addition to memorializing demonstrators who were killed by the
Chinese army, said Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., who sponsored the
legislation, the action serves ``to remind Beijing that America will
never and can never forget the ruthlessness and callousness of the
Chinese government in crushing their citizen-demonstrators and their

   The proposal expresses the sense of Congress that a statue should
be constructed to honor the fallen students.
   The amendment was added by voice vote to a bill authorizing State
Department programs for the new budget year.

<TEXT>
   A day full of thunderstorms with plenty of
hail and lightning means a good day at the office for Bruce Boe.
   He and a team of 200 researchers from across the country are part
of the North Dakota Thunderstorm Project, a $2.3 million effort that
involves scientists and students from 12 universities, 10federal and
state agencies and five private companies.
   Their aim is to find ways to reduce hail and enhance rainfall,
and also to learn more about the atmosphere around the storms.
   ``Actually, we've made tremendous progress,'' said Boe, director
of the North Dakota Atmospheric Resource Board and one of the
project organizers. ``There's something you can learn from every
cloud.''
   ``The bigger the better,'' added George Bershinsky, a weather
researcher from the University of Wyoming. He pilots an airplane
used for tracing and studying storms, cloud physics and air motion.
   The thunderstorm project, which began June 12 and will end July
22, uses six airplanes along with a complex system of ground radar
to study hail as well as the structure of storms _ the processes
that produce lightning and the role clouds play in the transport of
gases like ozone and carbon monoxide through the atmosphere.
   But in severe weather, the planes fly mainly during the day for
safety, Boe said. ``We haven't had as many really big thunderstorms
as we would have liked at the hours we would have liked,'' he said.
   Five graduate and 10 undergraduate students, whose training
ranges from meteorology and physics to engineering and computer
science, are using the project as a summer job. Their work is being
financed by a special National Science Foundation program for
students.
   Seven of the students, representing universities from New York to
Wyoming, are nicknamed ``hail chasers,'' because they are dispatched
during storms to catch and measure hail.
   Last week, when golf-ball size hail and a tornado were reported
about 100 miles north of Bismarck, the hail chasers were sent out to
collect samples. But they got a ribbing from their co-workers after
they missed the severe weather and wound up in an area of only light
rain.
   ``We're still trying to get our great hail,'' said Brenda Pobanz,
who just graduated from the University of North Dakota with a degree
in meteorology.
   Researchers from a number of countries with weather-management
programs, including Greece, Jordan, Morocco and South Africa, have
visited or are planning to visit the project to learn from the North
Dakota experience, Boe said.
   Of the 60 or 70 weather experiments conducted, about four dozen
have been successful, Boe said.
   The research team terms an experiment a success if ``the weather
elements are there and the equipment works properly and measures
what we want it to measure,'' he said.
   The project is being financed primarily by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration and the National Science Foundation.
   Boe said Bismarck was selected as the site because his agency has
been conducting weather research with NOAA for nearly a decade and
has the facilities and expertise.
   It may take several years to analyze all of the data accumulated
during the project, said Boe, who hopes for a follow-up project.
   ``This project won't answer all the questions about
thunderstorms,'' he said.

   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's son started
college this week and was accused of cheating even before he
attended a class, took an exam or cracked a textbook.
   A right-wing opposition party gearing up for parliamentary
elections expected by year's end is alleging the prime minister used
his clout to help his 17-year-old son, Rahul, get into the elite St.
Stephen's College.
   Admission is highly competitive and only about 1,350 students
attend the three-year college, located on the tree-shaded campus of
Delhi University.
   College officials say Rahul, whose entrance exams suggest he
shoots a pistol better than he solves a math problem, gained
admission through a limited quota set aside for athletes.
   ``The sports quota is just a ruse to accommodate the privileged
sections of the society,'' said Madan Lal Khurana of the Bharatiya
Janata Party, or the Indian People's Party.
   The college, Khurana added, doesn't even have a shooting team.
   But Prem Sagar Dwivedi, a history professor and member of the
college panel that selected the 390-member freshman class, dismissed
the suggestions and said the college has a shooting club that meets
regularly.
   ``Rahul's bona fides as a sportsman cannot be doubted. I haven't
heard anyone inside or outside the college questioning Rahul's
credentials,'' Dwivedi said.
   Rahul won three gold medals in a pistol shooting competiton
conducted by the Delhi State Rifle Association in November 1988. A
month later, he finished fourth in a national firing tournament held
by the National Rifle Association of India, the highest-ranking body
for the sport.
   For Rahul, going to college allows him to emerge from a highly
sheltered, well guarded cocoon. He plans to study history and will
attend day classes and then return to his family's official
residence.
   Rahul attended a private boy's school run by Roman Catholic
priests until 1982, when threats were made by Sikh extremists
against the Gandhi family. His grandmother, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, was assassinated on Oct. 31, 1984, and his father was
elected to succeed her.
   Rahul and his 18-year-old sister, Priyanka, were tutored at home.
Priyanka is studying psychology at a women's college in New Delhi.
   To counter opposition charges, the governing Congress Party
sponsored a welcome ceremony for Rahul on Monday, the first day of
classes.
   Party members hung banners saying ``Welcome Rahul Gandhi, the
Voice of Students.''
   Reporters were ordered to leave the campus when Rahul arrived in
a bulletproof car, accompanied by five bodyguards.
   He was greeted by several seniors who took him to the cafeteria
and cornered and bullied him for at least two hours in a tradition
for new students known as ``ragging'' and similar to hazing.
   ``Rahul was badly ragged by some unsavory elements. But I must
say he took it very sportingly,'' said Sanjoy Bhattacharya, a senior
history student.
   Since the controversy over Rahul's admission started, fellow
students have spoken out on his behalf.
   ``I don't like the way the opposition is carrying on the
anti-Rahul campaign. The poor chap hasn't had a normal education and
if he wants to attend a proper college now, what's wrong?''
Bhattacharya said. ``Give the poor guy a chance.''
   The Indian press, frequently critical of his father, has sprung
to Rahul's defense.
   ``One can only wish him well and hope he is able to lead as
normal a college life as possible, making friends with a wide
cross-section of people along the way,'' said The Sunday Observer, a
respected English-language weekly.
   Dwivedi said: ``Why all this fuss? Prime ministers' sons go to
college all over the world.''

turned north, putting it on course to pass close to Hawaii late
today and prompting authorities to warn residents anew to stock up
on emergency items.
   On Tuesday, the storm appeared to be turning away from the
islands, but it shifted to a northwesterly direction and forecasters
said Dalilia could come closer than they initially expected.
   Forecasters said Dalilia's new track would bring its center to
within 70 miles of Hawaii Island's south coast late today.
   The Central Pacific Hurricane Center expected to upgrade a
tropical storm watch _ meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were
possible _ to a hurricane warning for Hawaii Island, southernmost in
the Hawaiian chain.
   At 2 a.m. today, the hurricane was about 310 miles southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving west-northwest at about 13 mph, the
National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustained wind speed was
75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74
mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.
   National Weather Service forecaster Dick Sasaki said Dalilia's
hurricane-force winds extend to 25 miles from its center.
   ``The storm's center would have to pass very close or right over
any of the islands to bring any hurricane-force winds,'' Sasaki said.
   ``Right now our main concern is high surf,'' said Neil Gyotoku, a
spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense. ``High tide is this
afternoon and they're expecting bigger surf to hit about then.''
   There were no immediate plans for evacuation, Gyotoku said.
   Hawaii residents were urged to stock up on batteries, canned
goods and other emergency supplies.
   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed Tuesday when surf surged to
more than 15 feet on the southeast coast of Hawaii Island.
   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as a
precautionary measure,'' said Bruce Butts, a spokesman for Hawaii
County Civil Defense.
   Although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads
in some spots, Hilo police said there were no reports of injury or
damage as of late Tuesday.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over of Kauai with wind up to
117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.

<HEAD>Study Says Men Over 50 Benefit from Regular Aspirin</HEAD>

   Healthy men over age 50 appear to cut their risk of
heart attacks in half if they take an aspirin every other day,
although there is no clear evidence that younger men are helped, a
study concludes.
   A preliminary version of the research was widely publicized a
year and a half ago when it found a dramatic reduction in heart
attacks among regular aspirin users.
   Now, a more detailed analysis of the voluminous data gathered
over about five years in that research suggests that the benefits of
aspirin are most noticeable in older men, who are also at highest
risk of heart trouble.
   The research, called the Physicians' Health Study, was directed
by Dr. Charles H. Hennekens of Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston and published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Overall, the study found that men who took a single aspirin every
other day had a 44 percent reduction in their risk of heart attacks.
However, the benefits were limited to those over age 50, who cut
their risk about in half.
   ``We have a clear-cut, conclusive benefit on reducing a first
heart attack,'' said Hennekens.
   He said people should not start taking regular aspirin unless
they consult first with a doctor or other health professional. In
helping make a decision, doctors should consider a patient's other
risk factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol level and family
history of heart disease.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Valentin Fuster and others from
Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York wrote that ``aspirin appears
to be beneficial in the prevention of a first myocardial infarction
(heart attack), at least in men over the age of 50, and it has its
largest effect in those with uncontrolled risk factors.''
   Aspirin works by making the blood less likely to clot. Heart
attacks usually occur when clots form in the coronary arteries,
choking off the heart's blood supply.
   The study was conducted on 22,071 men doctors. They were given
packs of pills and randomly assigned to take aspirin, beta carotene
or dummy placebos. Although the aspirin part of the study is over,
the project is continuing to see if regular use of beta carotene
reduces the cancer rate.
   ``Since the publication of our preliminary report, 74 percent of
the participating physicians who were assigned to placebo have
requested that their calendar packs be changed to aspirin,'' the
researchers wrote.
   Among other findings:
   _Aspirin users were slightly more likely to have strokes, but the
number was too small to be statistically meaningful.
   _There was no overall decrease in cardiovascular deaths among
those taking asprin, but the study would have had to continue to the
year 2000 or beyond to show any impact on mortality.
   _The benefits of aspirin appeared to be greatest among those with
low cholesterol levels.

customs fine.</HEAD>

   William Lucas, nominated to be the government's
chief civil rights enforcer, was questioned sharply today about why
he and his family were fined in 1985 for failing to declare $8,900
worth of purchases to U.S. Customs inspectors.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, cited a U.S. Customs Service
report that the Lucas family failed to disclose the purchases when
they passed through customs at the Seattle airport following a trip
to Japan and South Korea.
   ``How do you explain concealing receipts and merchandise from the
customs inspectors?'' Metzenbaum asked.
   Lucas said the customs violation involved several pieces of
jewelry carried in a cosmetics case by a member of his family, whom
he did not identify. He was not aware of all the purchases his wife
and daughters made during their trip, Lucas said.
   The questioning took place as the Senate Judiciary Committee
began hearings on Lucas' nomination to be assistant attorney general
for civil rights. He said he had discussed the customs fine with
committee investigators.
   Metzenbaum asked why Lucas failed to disclose on a committee
questionnaire that he had once been investigated for violating
customs regulations for which he was fined. The senator did not
disclose the amount Lucas was fined for trying to conceal undeclared
merchandise.
   There was no investigation, Lucas said.
   ``You didn't think when they went through your pockets and the
pockets of your family that that wasn't an investigation?'' the Ohio
Democrat asked.
   ``I wasn't searched, nor did I consider that an investigation,''
Lucas responded.
   Lucas said his family declared they had purchased $4,800 worth of
merchandise on the trip.
   Earlier, Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and Joseph Biden,
D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, questioned
whether Lucas met professional qualifications to be assistant
attorney general for civil rights.
   Biden, who said he was ``favorably disposed toward you,'' told
Lucas ``one of the things you're going to have to speak to is your
lack of technical legal experience.''
   ``I think it's important to determine why and how deeply
committed you are to enforcing the civil rights laws of this land,''
Biden said.
   ``It remains to be seen whether Mr. Lucas is the right man for
this important job,'' Kennedy said during an opening statement. ``A
number of serious questions need to be raised.''
   The Justice Department acknowledged on the eve of today's hearing
that Lucas, a black Republican from Michigan, failed to state on a
1981 New York state bar application that he had once failed a bar
exam in the District of Columbia.
   Lucas merely answered that he had been admitted to the Michigan
bar in 1971 when asked if he had ever taken a bar examination or
applied to practice law in another state, Justice Department
spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade confirmed Tuesday evening.
   Metzenbaum said that unlike the other assistant attorneys general
selected to run the Justice Department's other divisions, Lucas
lacks extensive legal experience in the area he would supervise.
   ``Why is the civil rights division subjected to a different
standard? What kind of signal does that send to the American
people?'' Metzenbaum asked.
   Rep. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, accused Lucas' opponents of
raising ``shopworn arguments used by the bigots of old to keep black
Americans down.''
   Lucas' career, despite an orphaned upbringing in Harlem, ``is a
monument to what you could do and what you can accomplish in America
regardless of race or color or accident of birth,'' Grassley said.
   Lucas, who swore to the accuracy and truthfulness of his answers
when signing a statement submitted to gain admission to the New York
state bar in 1981, also stated he had never been a witness in a
court proceeding when, in fact, he had testified several times, Ms.
Burstion-Wade confirmed.
   He also inaccurately stated he had never been a party to civil
suits when he had been sued in his capacity as sheriff in Wayne
County, Mich., she confirmed.
   Ms. Burstion-Wade said the inaccuracies were not known to
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and his top aides until they
received a copy of the New York form this week. It had been
requested by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   While acknowledging the inaccuracies, Ms. Burstion-Wade added
that ``I don't see they negate four decades of public service.''
   ``There is no concern about his honesty or his ethics,'' Ms.
Burstion-Wade said. ``The man's background is just too admirable.''
   A number of civil rights organizations, including the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, oppose Lucas'
nomination, saying he lacks the legal qualifications for the job.
   In addition to his incorrect answers on the bar application,
Lucas has inaccurately described himself on resumes and in sworn
testimony as once having been a Justice Department lawyer.
   Employed as a legal assistant in 1963, Lucas left the Justice
Department after failing the District of Columbia bar. He joined the
FBI and later became sheriff and eventually chief executive of Wayne
County, Mich., which includes Detroit.
   Elected to public office as a Democrat, Lucas became a Republican
in 1985 _ a year before he ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor.

<HEAD>Chinese Retaliating Against Soldiers, Sources Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citizens angry at the army for killing
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing are retaliating with attacks on
soldiers, Chinese and Western sources said Wednesday.
   In Hong Kong, a Chinese language newspaper reported Wednesday
that about 20 more people were executed for joining in the
protests.Chinese officials denied the report.
   Incidents of shooting at soldiers in retaliation for the military
crackdown ``are going on, they're going on a lot and they're all
over the country,'' a Western diplomat in Beijing said on condition
of anonymity.
   He said there was no clear sign of a nationwide organization
behind the attacks, but he did not give other details.
   A Chinese source reported several cases of Beijing residents
firing on patrolling soldiers since the army shot its way into the
city center June 3-4. China has said about 200 people died in the
June attack, but Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources
said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.
   ``People who lost family members can be anguished enough to do
something rash, like shoot a soldier,'' the source said on condition
of anonymity. ``Too many weapons and ammunition were taken (from
army trucks) during the turmoil.'' It was not clear if any soldiers
have died in the attacks.
   Official media reported that some protesters are continuing
``counterrevolutionary activities'' underground, and government
spokesman Yuan Mu has acknowledged that guns taken by crowds from
army trucks could cause further unrest.
   However, there has been only one reported attack on soldiers, in
which a truck barrelled past a checkpoint in Beijing on June 17 and
fired at the soldiers, wounding one. Two men in the truck later were
arrested.
   The government said it suspected sabotage when dynamite blew up
on a Shanghai train June 26, killing 24 people, but the attack did
not appear to be connected to troops.
   In Hong Kong, the Chinese language newspaper Ming Pao said the
executions of about 20 people took place about 10 days ago. It said
most of the group were members of an outlawed independent workers'
union set up during the protests.
   The Beijing People's High Court and police refused to comment on
the report. Several dozen executions are known to have taken place
since the protests were crushed, but the authorities have linked
only 12 to the protests. Many Chinese believe the number is far
higher.
   Many Chinese also believe large numbers of arrests are continuing
in secret even though the number reported have trickled to a few a
week. More than 2,060 arrests have been reported in the official
media since June 4.
   The Western diplomat estimated arrests nationwide at no more than
5,000. Chinese sources have put the number in Beijing at more than
2,000.
   In other developments, the Japanese Embassy said Chinese police
have promised a thorough investigation of an anonymous threat to
kill two Japanese in China each month.
   The threat was made in a letter mailed to Japan Airline's Beijing
office and signed by a previously unknown group, the Blood-Bright
Dare to Die Squad. The group accused Japan of colluding with ``the
Communist Party dictatorial government and (plotting) to launch a
large-scale economic invasion of China.''
   Embassy spokesman Minoru Kubota said his government's warning to
Japanese citizens to be careful in visiting China, issued after the
army attacked the student protesters, still stands. He said no
further action would be taken until police complete their
investigation.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega today urged
President Bush to halt Washington's ``policy of war'' and stop
supporting the rebels as Nicaragua celebrated the 10th anniversary
of the Sandinistas' rise to power.
   ``The United States still hasn't decided to be respectful of the
rights of the nations of the Third World,'' Ortega told a Managua
rally of 200,000 cheering supporters, many waving red-and-black
flags of the ruling Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   ``If the president of the United States is for peace... he should
stop immediately his policy of war against the people of Nicaragua
(and) ... dismantle the Contras,'' Ortega said.
   Army and private trucks, public buses and family cars carried
Nicaraguans to the Plaza of the Revolution along Lake Managua
throughout the morning.
   ``Go! Go! Go!,'' shouted a squad of about 50 young people running
down a flag-bedecked avenue to the plaza. Most held small flags of
the Sandinista National Liberation Front and wore T-shirts with the
anniversary logo: ``We've got 10 down, and we keep going forth.''
   Some people had said they would boycott the rally because they
had little to celebrate in a country that ranks among the world's
poorest.
   In his 50-minute speech, Ortega said the government is
controlling inflation, and he repeated earlier pledges there will be
clean national elections as scheduled Feb. 25.
   The U.S. Congress cut off all but non-lethal aid to the Contra
rebels in 1988, shortly before rebel leaders signed a temporary
truce with the Sandinistas.
   Before entirely dismantling the Contras, the United States has
been insisting the Sandinistas reform election laws to accomodate
objections from opposition groups and ensure press freedom, fair
campaigning and balloting.
   Banks, businesses and government offices were closed to
commemorate July 19, 1979, when the victorious Sandinista rebels
marched into Managua to take power two days after dictator Anastasio
Somoza fled.
   Managua Mayor Carlos Carrion opened the ceremony with a speech in
which he said Nicaragua has withstood 10 years of ``imperialist
aggression'' and survived.
   ``Never again foreign domination,'' Carrion said. ``For 10 years,
Nicaragua's sovereignty has been in the hands of the people.
Nicaragua's sovereignty is not up for discussion, it's to be
defended with weapons.''
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the Sandinista Front,
carried no news on its front page, only two pictures of joyous
Nicaraguans, and in big red letters splashed accross the page: ``10
Years of Changes and Victory ... And More To Come.''
   ``Exciting, agitated, tormenting, hard and sweet; moving in their
pain and joy, these 10 years of revolution to which we have come
today, against all predictions and designs, have a positive balance
for the interests of the Nicaraguan people,'' it said in an
editorial.
   But some Managua residents said most of those at the rally would
be Sandinista militants or public employees afraid of losing
government jobs if they failed to attend.
   ``Five years ago, people were still very enthusiastic about the
revolution,'' a technician who did not want his name used said
Tuesday. ``People would paint and fix their houses, and neighbors
would tell each other, `Let's go to the plaza.'
   ``But Managua has been deteriorating. People are now feeling the
weight of the revolution.''
   An economic report underwritten by Sweden, Nicaragua's main
non-communist supporter, said last year's per capita output was
$300, making Nicaragua poorer even than Haiti, long the poorest
country in the hemisphere.
   ``Before, with what I earned I could support my children, buy
food,'' said a cleaning woman who identified herself only as
Socorro. ``But now, we're eating once a day. There just isn't enough
to go around. And I have two jobs and my husband also works.''
   The Sandinista government has blamed U.S.-supported Contra rebels
and U.S.-instigated cutoff of credit for the economic collapse. The
opposition blames Sandinista incompetence and the lack of private
sector confidence in the government.

<TEXT>
   A newspaper has lifted the lid off the dirty side
of the war in Afghanistan with two Soviet veterans' accounts of Red
Army soldiers beating innocent prisoners, trading submachine guns
for turncoats and barely surviving attacks by their own helicopters.
   The daring weekly Moscow News carried the war stories by Valery
Abramov and Ruslan Umiyev under the headline, ``The Whole Truth has
to be Told About this War!''
   Over the past year, the Soviet press has questioned the
leadership's decision to invade Afghanistan in 1979, but stayed away
from criticizing how the war itself was run.
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov came under public and
official attack at the Congress of People's Deputies last month for
claiming that Soviet pilots were ordered to kill Soviet soldiers who
were likely to be captured by Afghan guerrillas.
   Abramov told Moscow News that Sakharov's claim that Soviet
soldiers killed each other could have been based on a confused
firefight he witnessed in June 1980 in Faizabad.
   ``The guerrillas' fire was driving us into the ground. Suddenly,
our helicopters appeared and started to strafe our own battalions,''
Abramov wrote.
   ``It was some kind of hell,'' he said. The shooting stopped, he
said, after officers apparently understood their mistake.
   Umiyev, who served in Afghanistan from 1985 to 1987, said he,
too, had seen Soviet fliers mistakenly attack their own troops,
adding, ``It was quite a mess there, why should we be silent about
it?''
   Recounting ``incidents that are shameful to recall,'' Abramov
described how two Afghan prisoners suspected of being guerrillas
were brought into his camp.
   ``We already had people killed and missing. Lost friends ... and
we unleashed all our accumulated pain on those two. We beat them all
night, with short breaks. I, too, tried to beat them as painfully as
I could. It seemed as if they were to blame for the deaths of our
soldiers. And in the morning, it turned out they were peaceful
inhabitants who had never participated in any battles.''
   Umiyev told Moscow News the official silence should also be
broken about all the Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan who went over to
the other side.
   Soviet units often would exchange three guerrillas or 10
submachine guns for the chance to get their hands on such turncoats,
he said.
   His unit traded for one such soldier who reportedly had served
six years as a grenade launcher with the guerrillas, Umiyev said.
   ``We tried him right on the square,'' he said. ``Anyone could ask
him questions. He was silent and cried. They gave him eight years.
We were all mad that they gave him so little.''
   The nation's legislature, the Supreme Soviet, is evaluating the
decision to invade Afghanistan and is scheduled to report its
findings in October.
   The Soviet army completed its pullout from Afghanistan in
February. An estimated 15,000 Soviet soldiers and 1 million Afghans
died during the war.

<TEXT>
   The plane being used by a boy trying to
become the youngest pilot to fly around the world crashed and burned
while taking off from a remote village in northwest Alaska. There
were no serious injuries.
   The father of 11-year-old pilot Tony Aliengena was at the
controls when strong winds flipped the single-engine plane Tuesday
night, giving his son a break while the group took a side trip to go
fishing.
   ``We've come too far to turn back,'' the father said, adding he
hoped to find another plane for his son to fly home to Orange
County, Calif., and claim the record.
   Tony, meanwhile, was in tears at the Golovin Community Health
Clinic. ``This is the worst stop yet,'' he said.
   Of the eight people on board, four suffered facial cuts _ Tony,
his father, his Soviet pen pal and traveling companion, Roman
Tchermenykh, and Joseph Lee, 29, of Los Angeles, a member of a film
crew making a documentary on the flight.
   Federal authorities are investigating the fact that eight people
were on board a plane with seats for six, said Federal Aviation
Administration spokesman Paul Steucke in Anchorage.
   The boy wasn't at the controls of the single-engine Cessna
Centurion because the flight was part of a fishing detour from the
main route. A two-engine chase plane carries relatives, media and
others along for the record attempt, but the single-engine plane is
the one the boy pilots.
   The crash occurred about 9 p.m. as the travelers tried to take
off for Nome from a gravel airstrip. A Seward Peninsula community of
120 people situated on the Bering Sea 90 miles from Nome, Golovin is
inaccessible except by boat and air.
   Preliminary reports indicated the plane was destroyed by flames,
but Steucke said today it appears the plane can be patched up enough
to be flown to Nome for more work. The plane's right wing was
damaged by fire.
   ``I don't care about the Friendship Flight right now,'' said the
boy's mother, Susan, who is accompanying Tony on his journey along
with other family members, friends and members of the media. ``I'm
just glad that we're all alive.''

   A Peace Corps volunteer claims Rep. Gus Savage,
D-Ill., sexually assaulted her during a dinner outing in the capital
of Zaire, and material relating to the incident has been forwarded
to the House ethics committee, State Department officials said today.
   They confirmed a Washington Post story that quoted the volunteer
as saying Savage repeatedly fondled her for more than two hours in
the back of a chauffeur-driven embassy car.
   The woman said Savage continued his advances even though she
``tried everything ... short of hitting him, or hurting him
physically to make him stop,'' the newspaper reported in today's
editions.
   One State Department official, who insisted on anonymity, said
the U.S. ambassador to Zaire, William Harrop, had a confrontation
with Savage over the incident. An unidentified witness told the Post
that Harrop ``spoke very strongly'' to Savage ``chewed him out as
much as an ambassador chews out a congressman.''
   Jill Gross of the State Department inspector general's office
said today that allegations of the incident had been sent to the
House ethics committee on Tuesday night.
   ``They were sufficiently serious that someone should look into
them,'' she said.
   Efforts to reach Savage today were unsuccessful. He did not
return repeated phone messages left at his office.
   A Peace Corps official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the woman has not brought a formal complaint against Savage and the
agency would not pursue the case without her consent.
   ``The ball is in her court,'' the official said. ``It's something
we told her right from the beginning.''
   Neither the State Department officials nor the Post disclosed the
identity of the volunteer.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the House ethics
committee has authority to review the allegations against Savage.
   ``That committee is capable of reviewing matters within its
purview,'' Foley told reporters, adding that he was making no
judgment on the facts in the case.
   ``Every member of Congress has a high responsibility for personal
conduct as an elected member of the House of Representatives. If it
is true in this country, it is even more true when traveling abroad
as a representative of the United States,'' he said.
   The Post said Savage declined to comment on the account.
   An aide to Savage, Donnavan Dunkley, declined to discuss the
incident with The Associated Press when reached at home Tuesday
night.
   Peace Corps spokesman Lee Raudonis told The Associated Press the
volunteer had given the agency the account described in the
newspaper, but the agency had not been able to confirm the
volunteer's account independently.
   ``The fact that she's being given a new assignment indicates that
we think she is capable of the assignment and that we have
confidence in her,'' he said.
   The woman told the Post she did not file a formal complaint
because she did not want to publicize the incident and risk damaging
the Peace Corps. The paper said she agreed to the interview
reluctantly.
   According to the account in the Post, the incident happened March
19 when Savage made an official visit to the African capital of
Kinshasa and asked for a briefing on Peace Corps activities, which
the volunteer was scheduled to give in a few days.
   Other members of the dinner party included members of Savage's
staff and the American Embassy staff, including embassy information
officer Daniel McGaffie. Savage wanted to sample the city's
nightlife and insisted the woman ride with him, she told the paper.
   As soon as the three cars of the party left the ambassador's
home, ``He grabbed me,'' the volunteer said in her interview.
   ``He tried to force me to have sex with him. ... He kept touching
me, after I told him to stop, many times, loudly,'' she was quoted
as saying.
   After a two-hour outing that included stops at three or four
bars, the volunteer fled a hotel disco with Savage in pursuit, the
account continued.
   McGaffie was reported to have interrupted a ``tense public
encounter'' between the Savage and the volunteer and took the woman
home, according to the newspaper account.
   An official familiar with the meeting said Savage ``did not feel
as if it had been as extreme as she suggested.''
   The volunteer was sent to Washington for six weeks of treatment
of the sort given to victims of sexual offenses and is now awaiting
a new assignment by the Peace Corps.
   Sherman Funk, inspector general of the State Department, told the
AP, ``If true, the story is pretty egregious.''
   He said he had ``referred the incident to somebody else for
review. I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment further.''
   Savage has an unlisted number. The newspaper quoted him as saying
``Why don't you ask me about economic development projects? ...
   ``I don't want to talk about that ... Ask me the same kind of
questions you ask white congressmen. You don't ask white congressmen
questions like that ...,'' Savage, who is black, told the Post.

<BYLINE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Fitzwater, source comments.

   President Bush today was weighing costs and
timing as he neared a decision on a Space Council recommendation to
set up a manned outpost on the moon and send astronauts to Mars,
officials said.
   ``There's a lot of analysis that needs to be considered,
especially in terms of cost'' to maintain a human outpost on the
moon and a Mars mission, White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters. ``It is a costly venture and those aspects
need to be considered.''
   One administration official close to the issue said Bush appeared
likely to endorse the language before him in a draft speech that
calls for building a permanent moon post as a way station to Mars.
But what timetable he might set was unclear.
   ``It's not a question of whether we will go to Mars. Someday we
will go to Mars. It's a question of how quickly,'' said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The source added that
the president was mulling how specific he should be about dates for
the venture.
   Bush's speech Thursday will mark the 20th anniversary of man's
first steps on the moon, taken by Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong
on July 20, 1969.
   Sources said the draft speech on Bush's desk contained no
pricetag or timetable for such a project.
   Dr. Frank Martin, the head of NASA's exploration office, said
such a project would more than double the current NASA budget of
some $13 billion a year, bringing it to about 2 percent or 3 percent
of the total federal budget.
   While a strong supporter of an agressive space program, Bush did
not want to set expensive goals that could not reasonably be funded,
officials said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, a principal booster of the proposal
that came to Bush through the National Space Council that Quayle
chairs, expected to talk to the president about it by telephone
today between speaking engagements in California, said his press
secretary, David Beckwith.
   Aides noted that Bush could make significant revisions in the
speech before delivering it. Fitzwater said ``there are all kinds of
choices and options available here ... timing questions and so
forth.''
   Bush on Tuesday was noncommittal about what he will say in the
speech, which has been billed as a major space policy address.
   ``I'm not ready to say whether we're going to have a new space
initiative. I want to be sure that what I propose passes any test of
fiscal sanity, fiscal reasonableness,'' he told reporters traveling
home with him from his European trip.
   Another idea _ the possibility of a joint space venture with the
Soviets _ was not included in the recommendations sent to him,
according to two officials. The administration looked at the speech
more in terms of setting U.S. goals in space, independent of what
the Soviet agenda might be, one said.
   But that did not mean space cooperation with the Soviets has been
ruled out, the two officials said,
   The president also is expected to push Congress for renewed
funding of the ongoing Space Station project whose budget is
threatened by congressional cuts. Funding reductions proposed by the
House Appropriations subcommittee recently would ``seriously
undermine'' that project, Quayle said Tuesday.
   Quayle on Tuesday hinted at a bold proposal. In a speech in San
Diego, he said the administration ``is moving forward to put the
pieces in place for another great leap forward in space.''
   He said the nation ``must begin to think about the voyage of a
new Mayflower _ about expanding the human presence into the solar
system _ as a long-term goal.''
   The only specifics Quayle mentioned were continued White House
backing for three projects already announced _ Space Station
Freedom, a new Earth observation satellite, and the national
aerospace plane.
   He said that by the year 2000 the nation ``must be on our way to
pioneering the Solar System and establishing outposts on the moon
and Mars.''
   Space boosters want Bush to issue a call reminiscent of President
John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to the nation to land a man on the
moon by the end of the decade.
   White House officials preparing Bush's Thursday message on space
asked for extensive briefings on a NASA plan called ``Mission to
Planet Earth,'' a proposal for an intense environmental study of the
planet from space, sources said.
   ``There was talk that by supporting the Mission to Planet Earth
the president could help his image as the environmental president,''
a source at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said.

<TEXT>
   Rivers are rising and the people of
Bangladesh prepare for the annual deluge, which can bring the
blessing of rich harvests or the curse of destruction and death.
   After devastating floods last year that killed at least 1,400
people and submerged three-fourths of the country, the government
began an ambitious program to cope with future disasters.
   A giant earthen dam is being built around Dhaka, the capital, as
part of a two-year, $100 million flood-alleviation program.
   Warehouses of emergency rice and wheat supplies have been raised
in many parts of the country. About 400 helipads have been built to
facilitate emergency relief and rescue operations.
   Perhaps the most practical steps are being taken by the people,
who are resigned to the annual floods that invariably disrupt their
lives but, in good years, nourish the crops without washing them
away.
   At Mohadepur, a village of 6,000 people 30 miles northwest of
Dhaka, families have raised the ground beneath their bamboo houses,
which now stand on specially constructed hillocks several feet above
surrounding fields of rice and jute.
   The 22 men, women and children of four families who live on one
of the hillocks labored nearly a month, hauling baskets of gray mud
from the Isamati River, about 50 paces away.
   Jehanara, 20, lives in one of the four homes that form the
perimeter of the hillock's central courtyard. She said the houses
stand about 2 feet higher than they did when the 1988 flood peaked
in August and September.
   Last year, she and her neighbors said, the water reached at least
that far into their houses, which have mud floors. The walls are
made of mats woven from split bamboo, tied to bamboo poles, and the
roofs are of thatching or corrugated aluminium.
   Men from nearby houses said everyone in Mohadepur with the time
or money had raised at least the level of the family kitchen, which
usually consists of an earthen oven carved into the clay-like ground.
   During last year's flood, they said, families sometimes could not
eat for days at a time because there was no dry place to cook rice,
the staple in Bangladesh, and whatever other food was available.
   On an adjacent but lower hillock, Mohammad Ali said last year's
flood waters were three feet above ground level, so he raised the
area by two feet.
   How far people raise hillocks is a calculated gamble. The logic
goes like this: Since the 1988 flood was said to one in a century,
this one shouldn't be as bad, but if it is, knee-deep in water is
better than waist-deep or worse.
   Ali, prosperous by local standards because he raises more than
enough rice to feed his family and sells the excess, said he hired
17 men to elevate his compound. He said it took about 15 days and
cost him the equivalent of about $76.
   He said there is nothing he can do to save his one and one-third
acres of rice and jute if the floods are bad. The current rice crop
is due for harvest in late August.
   ``It's really difficult,'' the 40-year-old farmer said. ``In 1987
I lost the rice seedlings to too much rain. In 1988 I lost
everything to the flood.
   ``I may lose it again, but I can't find any other job. What can I
do? It's all up to Allah.''
   Rivers have not reached the levels of this time last year and
there is hope that, when they crest in a month or so, the floods
will be less severe. Up to 10 feet of water covered vast stretches
of Bangladesh last year.
   The government said 21 million people, nearly one-fifth of the
nation's 110 million, lost their homes last year and another 24
million were affected by the floods, which generally meant they were
temporarily displaced or could not feed themselves.
   About 30 million people relied on government-supplied food for at
least a month after the water receded.
   Because of the government program, if flooding is as bad this
year ``the number of people affected would be about (the same), but
the rescue work would be easier and quicker,'' Serajul Hossain Khan,
minister of relief and rehabilitation, said in an interview.
   He said the helipads would enable the air force to move food more
rapidly, but some foreign observers question whether helicopters are
the answer.
   ``What will they deliver except reporters?'' a Western relief
official said privately. ``On a good day they can get a dozen in the
air. You can't even begin to feed 30 million people by helicopter.''
   He and other foreign aid officials said the government appears to
have enough reserves, at least 1 million tons of rice and wheat, for
an emergency.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Promises to Reconsider Unpopular Sales Tax</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said Wednesday he would
review an unpopular sales tax, which has combined with sex and
bribery scandals to put his Liberal Democrats in serious danger of
losing this weekend's elections.
   His wife, Chiyo, appeared at a rally of party women in Yokohama
and apologized for the sex scandal, which involves allegations that
Uno kept paid mistresses.
   Polls indicate the Liberal Democratic Party, which has governed
Japan since it was formed in 1955, is the underdog in Sunday's
elections for half the 252 seats in the upper house of Parliament.
   Uno used his first stumping tour outside Tokyo since the campaign
began July 5 to pledge a review of the new 3 percent consumption
tax. It has become a a central election issue, particularly among
housewives already offended by the sex scandal.
   ``If there are areas that need review, I hope to take
responsibility and correct them,'' he told reporters at a televised
news conference in Osaka. Uno did not propose specific changes,
however, and reiterated general support for the tax.
   His party pushed a tax reform package through Parliament last
year during a boycott by opposition legislators, who were demanding
facts about alleged involvement of Liberal Democratic leaders in the
Recruit Co. influence-buying scandal.
   The conservative Liberal Democrats have majorities in both
houses, but consensus is highly valued in Japan and they were
criticized for ignoring opposition arguments that the sales tax was
unfair to low-income households. The tax reform law took effect
April 1.
   Uno described himself Wednesday as a ``commander leading the
battle'' and said he does not foresee a major loss this weekend, but
the governing party's No. 2 executive appeared to have a different
view.
   At a separate news conference Wednesday, Ryutaro Hashimoto hinted
at an alliance with the conservative opposition Democratic
Socialists if his the Liberal Democrats suffer a serious defeat, the
Japan Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Allegations about Uno's sex life arose soon after he replaced
Noboru Takeshita on June 2. Takeshita resigned to take
responsibility for the Recruit scandal, which tainted the highest
levels of government, bureaucracy and business but did touch Uno.
   At a university in Osaka where he delivered a speech Wednesday,
Uno was met by dozens of hecklers and protesters carrying placards
demanding his resignation.
   In Yokohama, his wife said: ``I deeply apologize for the
criticism regarding my husband.'' The party used 80 buses to bring
more than 5,000 women to the rally, where Mrs. Uno made only brief
remarks.
   Of the ruling party's 142 seats, in the upper house, 73 are not
being contested in this election. It must win 54 seats Sunday to
retain a majority, but the latest poll indicates it will get from 28
to 38.
   The poll by the national newspaper Mainichi also indicated major
gains for the leading opposition Japan Socialist Party, from its
current 21 seats to 64-70. Mainichi's poll was based on interviews
July 14-16 with 34,237 eligible voters chosen at random across Japan.
   Support for the Liberal Democrats was given as 27 percent, 18
percent lower than in a similar poll conducted before the last
election in 1986. The Socialists rose in popularity from 13 percent
in 1986 to 30 percent, and Mainichi sid 26 percent of respondents
were undecided.

   Department of Defense officials
envisioned thousands of red, white and blue balloons floating into
the air to celebrate National Constitution Week.
   But an environmentalist who has seen how deflated balloons kill
marine animals only saw red. His concerns prompted the Defense
Department to cancel proposed launches at military bases around the
country.
   Robert Schoelkopf, director of the Marine Mammal Stranding Center
in Brigantine, was alerted to a Pentagon memo with suggestions on
ways bases could celebrate National Constitution Week in September.
   One suggestion called for ringing tower bells for 202 seconds on
Sept. 17 while simultaneously releasing red, white and blue balloons.
   In recent years, Schoelkopf has recovered dead marine animals _
including whales, dolphins and turtles _ that have suffocated on
deflated balloons that fell to the sea.
   In addition, ``The Defense Department would be in direct
violation of the Clean Ocean Act, which prohibits the disposal of
non-biodegrable products into the ocean,'' Schoelkopf said.
   After unsuccessful attempts to reach Defense Department
officials, Schoelkopf turned to U.S. Rep. H. James Saxton, R-N.J.,
who appealed to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney earlier this month.
   ``We don't need to spend thousands of dollars in taxpayers' money
to launch balloons that will kill dolphins and other marine
animals,'' Saxton said Tuesday from his Washington office.
   A Defense Department spokesman said Tuesday that another memo was
in the works withdrawing the suggestion for a balloon launch and
explaining why.
   ``As soon as the problem was brought to our attention, everyone
was alerted,'' Maj. James L. Adams said. ``We're reversing that
suggestion.''

<HEAD>Witness Says Trainer of Pilots Agrees Crew Probably Misprogrammed
System</HEAD>

   Korean Air Lines' chief trainer of pilots
agreed in 1983 that crew members of Flight 007 probably
misprogrammed a navigation system, leading to the shootdown of their
jumbo jet over Soviet airspace, a witness testified Wednesday in a
lawsuit against KAL.
   Frank Houston of Seattle told a civil court jury in U.S. District
Court that he and other analysts who studied the tragedy reached the
conclusion while conducting tests in a simulator at Boeing
facilities in November 1983.
   At Houston's home, KAL's chief of training, Yoon Bae Kim,
``agreed by shaking his head in the affirmative'' about the idea
that the crew had misprogrammed the system, said Houston, resulting
in the plane being off course almost from the minute it took off
from Anchorage, Alaska.
   The team of analysts felt that the KAL crew probably had punched
into the plane's computerized navigation system the wrong number for
the longitude at Anchorage before taking off for Seoul, South Korea.
   ``It's like a touch-tone telephone; what they did in my opinion
is misdial,'' Houston said in describing the device the crew used to
program the navigation system aboard the plane.
   Houston said he invited those involved in the investigation ``to
my home. ... We had a drink. It seemed to be the consensus this was
the most likely cause.''
   ``The most likely cause of what?'' asked U.S. District Court
Judge Aubrey Robinson.
   ``The most likely cause of this tragic accident,'' replied
Houston.
   Houston explained that the misprogramming had caused the plane to
fly 10 degrees off course, leading it to a point 300 miles away from
its assigned flight path when it was shot down by a Soviet fighter
plane.
   The International Civil Aviation Organization concluded that
Flight 007 was off course for nearly 5{ hours and intruded into
Soviet territory for several hours before it was shot down.
   Houston, a retired airline pilot, was among the aviation experts
who assisted in the ICAO probe. The Sept. 1, 1983, shootdown killed
all 269 people aboard.
   Houston's characterization of Kim's views undermines statements
made Tuesday by George Tompkins, the attorney defending KAL in the
civil trial. Families of 138 of the dead passengers have filed suit
alleging willful misconduct by the airline.
   Tompkins said there was no proof of any programming error by the
crew and that Flight 007 was on course until shortly before it was
blown out of the sky by a Soviet jet fighter.
   The best evidence is that the crew of the KAL jumbo jet was
flying its correct route until about an hour before it was
destroyed, Tompkins said.
   Tompkins said the crew sent radioed position reports periodically
to Anchorage and Tokyo pinpointing the plane's location as being on
course for the first four hours of its flight.
   The families of the dead passengers are trying to prove that the
airline's crew knew it was off course but proceeded toward Seoul
anyway without the use of a misprogrammed navigation system.

   Police mistakenly escorted gang members
leaving a wake into another gang's territory, triggering a fight,
the sheriff's department said.
   One shot was fired at an officer during the July 12 melee and
authorities arrested 16 people, sheriff's Detective Robert Rifkin
said Tuesday. After the fight, an 18-year-old was killed in a
drive-by shooting that stemmed from the street fight, Rifkin said.
   Rifkin, an anti-gang detective, said the two escorting police
officers did not realize they were traveling with members of one
gang through territory controlled by another. The officers were
escorting the gang members as they walked from a wake for a slain
comrade.
   Police Lt. Robert Kimball, the officers' supervisor, said they
had no way of knowing that rival gang members were in the
neighborhood.
   Rifkin said he was told the brawl started after one gang member
being escorted told deputies he saw members of a rival gang, then
jumped into a car and approached the rival gang members.

   Trustees in this village where a woman went
on a shooting spree in a school have voted down a request to buy Uzi
submachine guns to replace shotguns carried in police cars.
   ``I do not believe we should have Uzis in Winnetka,'' said Jeanne
Bradner, village president in the suburb north of Chicago. Her vote
broke a 3-3 tie Tuesday night and defeated the proposal.
   Police Chief Herbert Timm asked the trustees for funds to buy six
Uzis, a request that was turned down by a Village Council committee
last week. In a last-ditch effort, three trustees then proposed that
Timm be allowed to buy two or three Uzis, a measure that was
defeated Tuesday.
   However, the trustees did approve funding for the police
department to replace revolvers with 29 semiautomatic Glock-17
pistols, which can fire 18 bullets before reloading. The
Austrian-made weapons cost $311 each.
   Winnetka is the stylish suburb where Laurie Dann went on a
shooting spree in an elementary school a year ago, killing one
student and injuring six other people before taking her own life.
   Timm said his request for new weapons was to replace out-of-date
firearms _ not in response to the Dann shootings. He said the Uzis
would replace 12-gauge shotguns that are kept in patrol cars.
   Some residents who opposed giving police rapid-firing Uzis said
the weapons would increase the chances of innocent bystanders
getting shot. Some also said the guns would be targets of thieves.
   Some residents also disapproved of the Glock-17s, arguing that
the pistols lack a built-in safety mechanism to guard against
accidental firing.

<HEAD>Authors Say Soviet Nuclear Arsenal Now Dropping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet nuclear stockpile peaked last year
and dropped in recent months because of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's military strategies, the authors of a book released
Wednesday said.
   ``The idea that they are churning out nuclear weapons like
sausage is baloney,'' William M. Arkin, one of the authors of
``Soviet Nuclear Weapons,'' said at a news conference. ``Under
Gorbachev there has been a significant change in the composition and
complexion of Soviet forces.''
   The book was published under the auspices of the Natural
Resources Defense Council, a private organization that describes
itself as ``long concerned about the dangers and problems posed by
the unleashed atom.''
   The volume contains pictures and explanations of Soviet nuclear
weaponry ranging from Blackjack bombers to Sierra class submarines.
It includes a map of what it says have been some 600 underground
nuclear explosions.
   The authors said they relied heavily on U.S. government
documents, using the Freedom of Information Act to obtain reports.
   One author, Thomas B. Cochran, said to Soviet journalists at the
news conference, ``This book should be published in the Soviet
Union.'' He and the other authors released a copy of a letter they
sent to Gorbachev during a recent trip to Moscow urging publication.
   ``You have stressed the need for historians to fill in the `blank
pages' of your history,'' the letter said. ``We hope that in some
small way our effort may stimulate Soviet accounts of the
development of atomic and hydrogen bombs, missiles, aircraft, ships
and submarines.''
   Figures in the book indicate a Soviet arsenal of 33,000 nuclear
weapons, about 40 percent larger than the United States has. But
Cochran, saying there is a U.S. superiority in readiness, said the
numbers can be deceiving.
   ``We believe that the arsenal is declining, that it peaked some
time last year,'' Cochran said of the Soviets' holdings. ``They're
not ahead of us and we're not ahead of them. The fact is both can do
a lot of damage to the other.''
   The book says the Soviets built up their arsenal grew because of
``the perception of how to achieve national security, the
advancement of certain foreign policy goals, the desire for
recognition as a superpower, domestic political struggles,
bureaucratic inertia, and military service rivalry.''
   Gorbachev's doctrine of ``necessary defensive sufficiency,''
however, has meant a slowdown.
   ``Soviet nuclear forces are following the U.S. pattern of the
past 10 to 20 years: Certain military missions that once used
nuclear weapons began to be phased out,'' a statement about the book
said. ``The weapon was either not replaced, or replaced with a
conventional system.''
   The book said the modernization of Soviet strategic nuclear
forces seemed to have slowed in the past two years, with the new
Blackjack bomber and SS-24 ICBM being introduced in small numbers.
   Arkin added: ``They have a lot of old junk and they never throw
anything out.'' But he also said, ``One should not confuse technical
obsolescence with real decisions to remove weapons.''
   He said large portions of the arsenals of both the United States
and the Soviet Union are not included in any of the arms control
negotiations.
   ``And those are the nuclear weapons that are most likely to cause
nuclear war,'' he said.
   He said 14,000 of the 33,000 Soviet warheads are not included in
any of the arms talks. He cited bombs on jet fighters, artillery and
naval weapons.

   A 9-year-old boy was trapped and unable to breathe
after a truck rolled over the top of his family's car, but
passers-by used a jack, crowbars and a pole to pry off the car's

   Rhonda Largo, 39, of Mesa, said she was driving with her son and
daughter Tuesday when the truck overturned, crushing their car's
roof and folding a seat over on Anthony.
   Ms. Largo and her daughter were not hurt, but Anthony was unable

'' she said.
   Seconds after the passers-by raised the roof and Anthony was able
to breathe again, firefighters arrived and cut away the wreckage to
free him.
   ``He was asking me `Am I going to die?' He was real brave. He
didn't cry,'' Rhonda Largo said.
   Anthony as in serious condition but his recovery prospects looked
good, officials of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center said.
   Authorities said the truck's brakes had malfunctioned. The driver
suffered minor injuries.

Seychelles will make an informal visit with Bush on Thursday.
   Rene is stopping in Washington during a trip to Seattle to pick
up a Boeing 767 airliner for Air Seychelles.

   Two jailed drug kingpins lived in luxury in a
crowded prison, taking up enough space for 250 inmates and filling
their opulent quarters with jewels, guns and dozens of their
friends, officials said.
   A pool table, a large aquarium, Turkish baths, video equipment, a
television, fruit trees, gardens, telephone and radio equipment and
even fighting roosters were found inside the quarters after the two
men were transferred, officials said.
   The two inmates, drug barons Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto
Fonseca Carrillo, are among those charged in the 1985 kidnapping and
slaying of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique
Camarena Salazar.
   The two invited five other prisoners and up to 50 friends and
relatives to stay at their refurbished quarters, said Alfonso
Cabrera Morales, city prisons director.
   Cabrera Morales said Tuesday that authorities confiscated seven
guns from Caro Quintero, and $109,000 in cash and an undetermined
amount in jewels from Fonseca Carrillo when the two were transferred
to maximum-security quarters recently.
   Television film of their sumptuous residences in the Northern
Prison showed kitchens, elaborately decorated living rooms and
bedrooms and a closet filled with Caro Quintero's cowboy hats. One
of the rooms had a fireplace.
   Reporters who visited the quarters on Tuesday said the plush
dwellings were air-conditioned and had telephone and radio
communications equipment. Caro Quintero's wardrobe included 35 silk
shirts, the Excelsior news service said.
   A maroon silk bathrobe hung in his marble bathroom, Excelsior
said.
   Cabrera Morales, who became prisons director four months ago,
said the plush lifestyle was uncovered during an investigation of
prison corruption.
   ``It was an unjust situation,'' he said.
   Each of the men was occupying a dormitory designed for 125
inmates.
   ``It's important to establish, and it is true, that another group
of 20 people who were not inmates, among them women, children,
assistants and all kinds of visitors there could be, were living
with them,'' he said of Caro Quintero's group.
   Fonseca also had 15 to 20 friends and relatives with him, he
said. Five other prisoners were invited to live there, he said.
   The official said complaints were filed against the two Tuesday
with the Attorney General's Office, he said.
   He blamed corruption in the prison system for the privileges.
   Lawyers for Caro Quintero and Fonseca have protested their move
to maximum-security prisons.
   Caro Quintero's lawyers said Monday he had ordered them to file a
complaint to the Mexico City prison system for abuse of authority,
conspiracy and intimidation, the newspaper El Financiero reported.
   Caro Quintero is serving a 34-year sentence for weapons and drug
charges. Fonseca is serving an 11 year sentence on other drug and
weapons charges.
   Neither he nor Fonseca have been tried in the Camarena case.
   Camarena and his Mexican pilot were kidnapped Feb. 7, 1985, in
the western city of Guadalajara. Their bodies were found on a ranch
March 5 of that year.

   Sectarian battles in Beirut and south
Lebanon killed three people and wounded seven Wednesday, and a
Spanish diplomat said 34 of his countrymen will be evacuated because
of the danger of random shelling.
   One person was killed and four were wounded in artillery duels
between Christian and Syrian forces in Beirut, police said. Two
others were killed and three wounded in artillery battles between
rival militias in south Lebanon, they said.
   The Spaniards, who were said to be all those remaining in Lebanon
apart from diplomats, were leaving overnight from the Christian port
of Jounieh, north of Beirut, and will go to Cyprus, said a Spanish
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Most of those departing said they were glad to be leaving but
said they want to return if the fighting eases.
   ``We'll always have the hope of returning to Lebanon,'' said one
of the Spaniards, Rosa Marco Moreno.
   Spanish Ambassador Pedro Manuel de Aristegui was killed April 16
when a Syrian mortar round hit his home in Christian east Beirut
during shelling duels between the Syrians and troops loyal to
Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun.
   The embassy, under Charge d'Affaires Norberto Ferrer, will
maintain its reduced staff, the diplomat said. He did not say how
many diplomats remain.
   Most Western embassies are operating on reduced staffs located in
the Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   The U.S. Embassy cut its personnel to fewer than a dozen shortly
after the battles between Aoun and the Syrians broke out March 8.
   There has been no organized evacuation of foreigners recently,
but the U.S. and British embassies have called on their citizens to
leave Lebanon because of the Beirut fighting.
   The battles have killed 420 people and wounded 1,692.
   The fighting began after Aoun, who also leads the Christian half
of this country's divided government, tried to block Moslem-run
ports and later vowed to drive the Syrians out of Lebanon.
   About 40,000 Syrian troops are here under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Syrian gunners again shelled Christian ports north of Beirut on
Wednesday, while Aoun's forces shot at Syrian artillery emplacements
in Moslem west Beirut, police said.
   In south Lebanon, police reported fierce exchanges of howitzer
and rocket fire between Israeli-backed militiamen of the South
Lebanon Army and guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
   The police spokesman said the casualties occurred when South
Lebanon Army gunners pounded the Hezbollah-controlled villages in
the western Bekaa Valley.
   The barrage scored several direct hits on a Syrian army outpost
in an abandoned government school in Mashgara, the spokesman
reported. He said it was not known if there were any casualties
there.
   The spokesman said Hezbollah responded with salvos of 107mm
rockets fired at the mountain town of Jezzine and surrounding
hamlets. The South Lebanon Army controls that town.
   There was no report of casualties there.

   A twin-engine plane caught fire shortly
after takeoff today and crashed into a house near the airport,
killing the pilot and a baby in the home and injuring six other
residents, authorities said.
   The home of Henry Beam, 33, and his wife, Janice, 31, burned to
the ground after the Beechcraft 18 cargo plane slammed into it at
about 7:20 a.m. They and four of their children suffered minor
injuries.
   The body of 6-month-old Paul Beam was found in the rubble about
10:30 a.m.
   Henry Garbrick, director of operations of Center Airlines in
Reedsville, Pa., which owned the plane, identified the dead pilot as
Benjamin S. Vitalini, 50, of Leroy, N.Y.
   Barry Majerowicz, 28, a neighbor, said neighbors had to restrain
Beam from returning to the burning house to try to save his son.
   ``People were standing around because they couldn't get in to
help,'' said another neighbor, who identified herself only as Ellen.
``I saw the mother and father come out of the side of the house by
the kitchen, and she laid out on the side of the house screaming,
`My babies! My babies!'''
   ``I heard this spitting and sputtering and a big bang,'' said
William Shelton, another neighbor. ``I looked out the window and the
house across the street was totally engulfed in flames. I ran out
and there was nothing anybody could do to get inside the house. It
was totally involved.''
   Duncan Pardue, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration in New York, said the plane took off from
Baltimore-Washington International Airport, bound for Winchester,
Va. Two minutes later, the pilot declared an emergency, saying the
plane was on fire and that he was returning to the airport.
   Moments later, the plane crashed into the house, about one mile
from the airport, and burst into flames, Pardue said.
   Phil Farney, a witness, said he saw flames shooting from the
cockpit moments before the crash and saw two adults and several
children running from the house.
   Only one corner of a brick fireplace remained standing in the
one-story house, in a subdivision two blocks from a major state
highway that borders the airport. Thick, white smoke still poured
from the blackened rubble two hours after the crash.
   Ferndale is midway between Baltimore and Annapolis, Md.
   North Arundel Hospital spokesman Alison Tavik said Beam, 33; his
wife, 31; sons Henry IV, Joshua and Benjamin; and daughter Dana
suffered minor burns and abrasions and were expected to be released
later in the day. The children range in age from 2 to 9.
   Officials from the National Transportation Safety Board and the
FAA were at the scene. The FAA said the plane was carrying cargo for
United Parcel Service.
   ``Everybody here is pretty shaken up,'' Shelton said. ``I saw no
evidence of the plane when I ran across the street. I think the
plane is probably inside the house.'' He said the Beams had only
recently moved in.
   ``We've had a running fight with the airport to get the runways
changed. We know we're up against the big boys,'' said Bonnie
Thurston, 48, who lives five doors down from the house.
   The two houses on either side suffered only minor damage.

   Military pilots who chased Thomas
Root on his flight down the East Coast saw his head move several
times during the 800-mile trip when he claimed to be unconscious, a
federal investigator said today.
   The pilots also noticed changes in the position of the sun visor
on the plane's windshield, said Andrew Alston, an investigator with
the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Root was confronted with the pilots' accounts this morning but
was unable to explain the movement, Alston said. Root has maintained
that he lost consciousness and traveled on autopilot before ditching
in Bahamian waters last week.
   ``Various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the
right his head would turn to the right and as he was intercepted
from the left, his head would move to the left,'' Alston said. ``The
sun visor moved position at least three times during the flight.''
   Alston said any criminal investigation about the mystery flight
would be handled by the FBI.
   Officials also said a blood test screening for carbon monoxide in
Root's blood system turned up negative, raising further questions
about whether he fell unconscious.
   In other developments, reports surfaced that two days before
Root's mysterious 800-mile flight, a federal task force began
investigating him on suspicion of running guns and drugs.
   A gun manufacturer and a police chief, meanwhile, cast doubt on
Root's claim that he was shot when his gun discharged as the plane
crashed in Bahamian waters last week.
   ``He's been saying some things that are now ludicrous,''
Hollywood police Chief Richard Witt told The Associated Press late
Tuesday. ``Nobody is going to know what really happened until he
starts to put away those things that are implausible and starts
talking about what's plausible.''
   The task force, working under the Drug Enforcement
Administration, began investigating the Washington lawyer eight days
ago after a meeting of state and federal law enforcement officials
from Washington, Maryland and Virginia, according to today's Fort
Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel.
   The group took action because of the discovery of 35 guns and
five gallons of ether, a chemical that can be used to process
cocaine, during an April 24 search of the hangar where Root stored
his plane, said Emile Manara, a special agent working for the task
force.
   Task force members told the Sun-Sentinel that the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration has uncovered evidence suggesting that
Root also had made unscheduled landings in remote areas.
   Manara said such behavior fits the pattern of suspected drug
smugglers, but he cautioned that the task force had not found any
direct evidence linking Root to drug smuggling or gun running.
   ``We thought that this guy warranted some looking into,'' Manara
said.
   Root, 36, remains in stable condition at Memorial Hospital in
Hollywood with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. He has said he
doesn't know why he passed out during the flight and claimed his
.32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver, kept in the plane's glove
compartment, discharged during the crash.
   Dick Bachmann, vice president of Smith &amp; Wesson, told the AP that
the gun's safety features make such accidental firings impossible.
``Suggestions that it could are absolutely false,'' he said.
   And Witt, a veteran homicide investigator, told the AP there was
``indisputable scientific proof'' that Root's bullet wound was at
least four hours old when he arrived at the hospital.
   Witt's claim supported the findings of U.S. Coast Guard surgeon
James Rahman, who has said that peritonitis _ or inflammation of the
abdominal cavity _ showed Root must have been shot at least two
hours before he was rescued.
   ``All this would indicate that Mr. Root is being less than
truthful,'' Witt said.
   Manara said the task force investigation of Root has been put on
hold while other agencies make their inquiries into the flight.
   The search of Root's hangar at the Manassas, Va., airport, also
turned up chemical lighting sticks, which smugglers often attach to
drug loads tossed out of airplanes, said Bill Kelmartin, a Prince
William County, Va., police investigator assigned to the task force.
   Kelmartin said that in an interview after the hangar search, Root
told him and a U.S. Customs agent he kept the sticks in the
airplane's cabin for ``backup lighting'' in case of an electrical
problem.
   Root's work for Sonrise Management Services Inc., a company that
deals with radio stations, also is the subject of investigation and
legal disputes.
   A lawsuit filed July 3 in U.S. District Court in Macon, Ga.,
accused Root of legal malpractice, breach of contract and fraud in
handling a $75,000 transaction for Dr. Kenneth Bazemore of Byron,
Ga. Bazemore's suit contends Root sent the money _ meant as an
initial payment for two broadcast companies _ to Ralph Savage,
chairman of Sonrise, without permission.
   The lawsuit stems from Bazemore's plans to buy Savage's interest
in Vista Communications Inc. and Desert Broadcasting Corp. in Palm
Springs, Calif. It seeks return of the money, damages and legal fees.

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old who escaped from a boys'
home and evaded police by living in a forest has embarrassed social
authorities and prompted a parliamentary investigation into the case.
   The youth, identified only as Pikkis, has been on the run in the
forest near his former home in Espoo, outside Helsinki, for more
than a week. Friends secretly gave him food and clothing.
   Pikkis fled from an institution for homeless boys in Turku, 125
miles from Espoo, where he was sent by social authorities 18 months
ago.
   ``I ran away because I could not live in that place. The people
there are pigs. They ordered me about and hit me,'' Pikkis said in a
television interview, in which only his voice was heard.
   ``Living in the forest is much better than being in that boys'
home. I wouldn't go back even if they paid me,'' Pikkis said.
   The case of Pikkis, dubbed the ``forest boy'' by the media, has
generated interest in a country that prides itself on the high level
of welfare for the unfortunate and the care available for all
citizens.
   Assistant parliamentary ombudsman Pirkko Koskinen said
``something was apparently rotten,'' and she had commissioned a full
report on the case.
   ``Obviously, an 11-year-old boy cannot play at being Robinson
Crusoe. The forest is no place for him to live. We must find a
solution to the problem before the hot summer weather ends,'' she
said. ``Of course, what I'm particularly interested in is to find
out what happened at that boys' home in Turku.''
   Pikkis was sent to Turku after his parents separated because,
according to press reports, his father was incapable of looking
after him and his mother didn't want to.
   Annikki Alho, senior psychologist at the Turku boys' home, denied
anyone was beaten at the home, but said she could not discuss
Pikkis' specific case.
   ``It is obvious that our methods do not include hitting. We never
use such means on anyone. Besides, it is forbidden by law,'' Alho
said.
   ``Yes, there are Dickensian overtones to the whole affair but
when we get to the bottom of it I'm sure it won't be as bad as made
out by the press,'' Alho said.
   Last weekend, Pikkis was given shelter in a friend's house after
four adults were allowed in on his secret.
   On Monday, only minutes before he was due to meet welfare
authorities, neighbors put the police on his track, and the boy
again went underground.
   ``It is really unfortunate that we did not make contact with the
lad because we have a foster family lined up for him. At the moment
it seems that the media know more about the case than we do,'' said
Laura Jussila, social welfare officer in Espoo.
   ``Our prime concern is with the well-being of the boy but we do
not want to break the law or step on anyone's toes,'' Jussila said.

<HEAD>Miners' Strike Eases in Siberia But Spreads in Ukraine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Siberian miners returned to work after the
government made pay concessions, but more walked out in the Ukraine
and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday the coal strike
could imperil his reforms.
   Gorbachev said there were reports of railway workers being urged
to strike, and if labor trouble spreads, ``we may have to take such
extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been doing'' to
modernize the economy. He did not elaborate.
   Strikes are rare in the Soviet Union and were ended by force
before Gorbachev gained power in March 1985.
   Tass said 24,000 strikers in the Kuznetsk Coal Basin of western
Siberia were working Wednesday after some of their demands were
granted, and called the partial return a ``change for the better.''
State television said 150,000 Kuznetsk miners remained on strike.
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, said strike committees in
four Kuznetsk cities decided to end the walkout, which began July
11, and that coal deliveries had resumed.
   A correspondent said on the evening television news program
``Vremya'' that the strike had spread to 70 of the 120 mines in the
Donetsk Basin of the Ukraine, more than triple the previous number,
and mine construction workers joined the walkout.
   In a report from the Donetsk city of Yenakiyevo, ``Vremya'' said
steel and coke-chemical plants were ``on the verge of a stoppage''
for lack of coal. A striker said on the program that miners agreed
to provide 1,000 tons to one coke-chemical plant to keep it running.
   Earlier reports in the official press had said operations at
steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and
coke.
   The strikes in the country's two leading coal basins are the
worst Soviet labor unrest since the turbulence of the 1920s, a few
years after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
   In Moscow, Gorbachev told the national legislature the strikes
had deprived the nation of more than 1 million tons of coal and
``there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strike
as of Aug. 1.''
   ``Such a development of events poses a threat to the
implementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika,''
his economic reform program, Gorbachev said, and issued his warning
about possible ``extreme measures'' if the trouble spreads.
   Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegram
assuring Donetsk miners all concessions granted the Siberian miners
would apply to the men working other Soviet coal fields.
   The government agreed to most miner demands, including those on
pensions and overtime, Gorbachev told the Supreme Soviet
legislature, but he added that settling some longer-term issues
would take up to a month.
   Tass outlined a concessions package tha includes bonus pay to
night shifts and for men using pneumatic hammers. Strikers also have
complained about poor housing and shortages of consumer goods and
food, and the government has made general pledges of improvements in
those areas.
   Anatoly Saunin, a legislator from Donetsk, told the Supreme
Soviet every day lost in the mines costs millions of rubles that
otherwise might help improve living conditions in the entire nation.
   ``You mustn't hold a knife to the throat'' of the government, he
said, apparently addressing the strikers.
   Izvestia said coal production worth $31 million had been lost in
Donetsk and the strike had cost industry in one Siberian region $75
million.

<HEAD>Steelworkers Say Deng's Speech Cleared Their Minds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY WILHELM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Off-hours classes at the Capital Iron and Steel
Co. used to focus on new technologies. Now, however, study is
mandatory and the text is senior leader Deng Xiaoping's speech on
crushing pro-democracy protests.
   All 184,000 workers at the company's facility in western Beijing
are taking part in once-weekly classes in which the themes of Deng's
speech are repeated, examples are raised and personal experiences
are recounted and analyzed.
   ``After studying (Deng's speech) I improved my thinking and
understand more clearly the nature of the rebellion,'' Wang Songjie,
a worker in Capital Steel's sintering plant, told five co-workers,
two top plant officials, three lower-ranking officials and a foreign
journalist on Wednesday.
   The workers, some about to go on shifts and some coming off,
gathered for their class in a tiny factory sitting room, copies of
Deng's June 9 speech to army officers balanced on their knees.
   Noisy fans kept the hot, muggy air circulating as the six
students took turns summing up what they learned about the
seven-week student movement for a freer society that Deng condemned
as an effort to overthrow the government and socialist system.
   The army ended it June 3-4 with an attack on the protesters in
central Beijing in which hundreds and perhaps thousands of people
were killed. Thousands have been arrested since.
   Not one of the participants mentioned the deaths or arrests, but
Wang appeared to defend them.
   ``If bad elements savagely cause turmoil and don't allow us to
attack them, this would be so unfair,'' he said. ``Martial law is
supported by the people.''
   ``We must have unified thinking,'' said Li Zuowei, an engineer.
``What is this thinking? It is the policy expressed by Deng
Xiaoping. This cannot be shaken and will not be changed.''
   Phrases from Deng's speech and newspaper commentaries abounded:
``a handful of people with ulterior motives,'' ``stability and
unity,'' ``uphold production,'' ``grasp well ideological education.''
   ``There have been many rumors,'' said worker He Dakun. ``But
after studying Deng Xiaoping's speech we expelled all outside
disturbances from our minds and put all our efforts into our work.''
   Rumors are indeed legion, including shaky reports that workers at
other factories are staging slow-down protests against the
government. At one point during the protests students reported they
had heard that Capital Steel workers were on strike, but those at
Wednesday's class denied it.
   ``In fact, many workers came to work even though transportation
was stopped,'' He said. ``One worker, Mu Kehua, in order to fulfill
the (factory) quota spent 70 yuan (about $19) on a taxi to get to
work.''
   Cao Muming, director of the sintering plant, said only one of his
plant's 1,088 workers joined the protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   ``He is being investigated and is studying,'' Cao said.
   The workers' recitations were expressionless, and there was no
opportunity to ask them privately what they thought. Many Beijing
residents say privately they oppose the army crackdown, although not
all supported the students.
   All across the nation, work units are holding classes to study
Deng's speech with the aim of wiping out the silent opposition. But
Capital Steel is taking special pains.
   As Beijing's most prominent factory, its workers epitomize in the
public mind the urban proletarian who is supposed to lead socialism.
During the student movement, authorities reportedly threatened to
punish any Capital Steel worker who took part.
   Now, they are determined to maintain Capital Steel's image as a
socialist bastion. Every other week, the workers in each plant
gather by the hundreds for political lectures.
   But the real education comes in the small groups, where workers
must show they have internalized the message.
   For any Chinese over the age of 30, that may not be difficult.
Veterans of the 1966-76 far leftist Cultural Revolution and more
recent, less-violent political campaigns are experienced in
stringing together phrases from official documents.
   The only time the discussion became lively was when a reporter
asked about the date of the largest march of the student movement,
when more than 1 million people filled Beijing streets.
   ``That was May 17,'' the workers said. What happened on the
street, it seemed, they had no need to study.

   Doctors Wednesday reported a growing number of
stress-related illnesses among people in a resort city southwest of
Tokyo that has been jolted by thousands of tremors and several
volcanic eruptions in the past two weeks.
   ``We've had an increasing number of patients complaining of
insomnia and gastritis due to stress and fear of earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions,'' said Mikio Kakefu, director of the National
Hospital in Ito City.
   Ito, a coastal resort city on the Izu peninsula, about 60 miles
southwest of Tokyo, has had more than 23,000 temblors, including 486
strong enough to be felt, since June 30.
   On July 13, an undersea volcano erupted off the Ito coast,
creating a mound 82 feet high, according to the Maritime Safety
Agency, Japan's coast guard.
   Volcanic activity has slowed since then, and no strong
earthquakes have been recorded since Sunday. No injuries or damages
were reported after the eruption.
   But the Central Meteorological Agency has warned the volcano is
likely to erupt again because the movement of magma, or molten rock,
continues.
   Kakefu said the hospital, which has an average of 250 outpatients
daily, Monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches,
insomnia and diarrhea, ``all from fear and stress.''
   ``They didn't feel sick for a couple of days after the eruption
because they were still tense,'' he said. Kakefu said he does not
have any statistics, but indicated the number of such patients is
likely to increase.
   Pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortly
after the eruption, said Masaaki Mochizuki, an Ito veterinarian.
   He said he has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the
``earthquake syndrome'' between July 4 and July 14.
   Symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite were
frequent among cats, and many dogs suffered skin problems including
rashes and hair loss, he said. He said some dogs were also afflicted
with coughing and trembling due to excessive fear.
   ``My busiest day was July 14, the day after the eruption,''
Mochizuki said. ``Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than in
people because animals are more sensitive, and they feel the
temblors and noises more strongly.''
   ``We humans have information from the municipal office and the
meteorological centers, which help to relieve our tensions ... but
such things don't work for animals,'' he said.

   Bulgaria, which has no diplomatic
relations with South Korea, will open a trade office in Seoul this
week, government officials said Wednesday.
   Under a bilateral accord reached this year, South Korea opened
its trade office in Sofia in April, they said.
   Bulgaria will thus become the fifth East European nation to
exchange trade offices with anti-communist South Korea, following
the lead of Hungary, Yugoslavia, Poland and the Soviet Union.
   Trade between Bulgaria and South Korea, which totaled $3.4
million in 1987, almost tripled last year, according to officials at
the state-run Korea Trade Promotion Corp.
   Hungary became the first communist nation to establish full
diplomatic ties with South Korea in February. Yugoslavia and Poland
are expected to follow suit by the end of this year.

   The 20th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's stroll
on the moon certainly isn't going unnoticed Thursday in Moon, Ky.
   The mountain hamlet of perhaps 75 people already has installed
new ``Moon'' signs at both ends of town on highway 172 and is geared
up for a party that includes a prize drawing with a theme.
   Grand prize: a case of Moon Pies, a picture taken with the
postmistress of Moon, dinner and a play at Jenny Wiley State Park,
and a ``giant step'' in wet cement outside the Moon Post Office. The
first 10 runners-up also get boxes of the marshmallow-filled pies.
   The festivities were organized by Langley Franklin, president of
the Kiwanis Club in nearby West Liberty, who was in junior high
school when Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon.
   Both NASA and Gov. Wallace Wilkinson were invited to the event.
   Wilkinson sent his regrets and noted, ``It sounds like an out of
this world experience.''
   NASA politely thanked Moon and the Kiwanians for their interest.

   Dancers from the Bolshoi Academy dropped
the pas de deux for a few do-si-dos during a visit to an American
dairy farm.
   About 90 dancers and staff from the Soviet troupe put on T-shirts
and red bandanas for the old-fashioned hoedown at the Bella Estancia
farm Monday night.
   They were guests of the Indiana Dance Ambassadors, a group of
5-to 18-year-olds who wanted to give the travelers a look at life in
rural America. The Soviet group watched the American youths perform
a few tap dance routines, dined on country chicken and toured the
farm.
   ``They're amazing. They're so kind and generous,'' Beth O'Brien,
13, said.
   Like the other youngsters, she received gifts from the Soviet
visitors _ three pins, a small wooden doll, a book and a spoon.
   Soviet ballerina Galina Stepanyenko, 23, shared her impressions
of an American farm: ``It is so nice for someone to have such a
farm. When someone has such a farm, there's no necessity for them to
live in the city.''

<TEXT>
   Adnan Khashoggi has known the good times,
maintaining luxury homes in 10 cities and continent-hopping in his
private DC-8.
   More recently, he's known the bad: involvement in the Iran-Contra
scandal, a bankruptcy filing for one of his companies, indictment in
the Marcos case, and arrest and jail as Prisoner 67391.
   The 53-year-old Saudi financier has seen it all in an
extraordinary entrepreneurial life dedicated to the accumulation of
spectacular wealth and the cultivation of contacts worldwide.
   He was extradited to the United States from Switzerland on
Wednesday to face arraignment in New York on federal charges
stemming from Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos' alleged
multimillion-dollar theft of the Philippines treasury.
   Prosecutors accuse Khashoggi of posing as the owner of some of
the assets that were actually acquired by the Marcoses.
   Khashoggi's indictment and subsequent arrest on April 18 _
authorities grabbed him in an elegant Swiss hotel _ continued a
recent series of woes which include financial troubles and constant
controversy.
   The son of a physician to the Saudi royal family, Khashoggi
showed his talent in the art of the deal at an early age. While he
was still a boarding school student in Egypt, he introduced the
fathers of two classmates: one who made towels and sheets, the other
who was in the market for them.
   Khashoggi pocketed 200 pounds and learned an important lesson:
``It's only (by) putting people together you make money.''
   Khashoggi came to the United States to study economics at
California State University at Chico.
   While in California, he arranged for the export of U.S. goods to
Saudi Arabia. When he returned to his native country, he used his
royal connections to continue as broker between the West and Saudi
Arabia.
   Guns became Khashoggi's bread-and-butter, and he served as a
major conduit for military goods bound for Saudi Arabia.
   His Triad Holding Corp. soon branched out into Kenyan real
estate, Asian hotels, Indonesian shipping, French fashions, Lebanese
furniture, cattle raising in Arizona and an import company in the
Philippines.
   At the height of his financial success, he went through $250,000
a day. His yacht, later sold to developer Donald Trump, was fitted
with gold fixtures.
   But in the mid-1970s, Khashoggi became embroiled in the scandal
surrounding bribes by U.S. companies to foreign governments _
although he was never charged.
   It was alleged that part of Khashoggi's commissions were funneled
to foreign officials. In 1977 he flew to Barbados to avoid a
Securities and Exchange Commission subpoena; two years later, he
voluntarily gave a deposition to the SEC.
   His name made headlines again in 1986 when it was revealed that
he had brokered the U.S.-Iran arms deal at the center of the
Iran-Contra scandal.
   Khashoggi acknowledged he had a role in the deal, and said he
lost $10 million on it. He added that he never expected to make a
profit. If the result was peace between Iran and Iraq, he said, he
would make money by helping rebuild both countries.
   Khashoggi's wealth, meanwhile, seemed to vanish. Triad America
Corp., his U.S. holding company, filed for protection under
bankruptcy statutes. Work stopped on a $400 million office-shopping
complex in Salt Lake City.
   A British company, Lonrho PLC of London, sued because Khashoggi
defaulted on two $4 million loans; authorities temporarily seized
two Khashoggi jets and his two-story duplex apartment on Manhattan's
Fifth Avenue.
   Finally, Khashoggi defaulted on a loan to the Sultan of Brunei,
who claimed the collateral _ his yacht, the Nabila. The Sultan then
sold the boat for $30 million to Trump.

   Capitol Hill, which produces 60 tons of trash a
day, took a look Wednesday at ways it could recycle more of its
words, or at least the paper they're printed on.
   Before the House subcommittee on procurement and printing was a
bill by Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y., calling on the architect of the
Capitol, George White, to devise a plan to recycling more of
Congress' rubbish.
   Only 10 percent of the paper the House and the Senate throws away
now is sold for reuse. Green said by passing his bill Congress would
be ``setting an example for the rest of the country.''
   White laid before the subcommittee an elaborate plan. It called
for a year-long pilot program under which workers in two
congressional office buildin of the executive, legislative and
judicial branches of the federal government'' to comply with local
laws ``respecting control and abatement of solid waste or hazardous
waste disposal.''
   ``We expect you to do it,'' she said.
   Fifty-three percent of Washington's waste is paper, said Ms.
Winters.
   ``The very nature of our city is reflected in the waste generated
within the city,'' she said.
   The city, she said, produces 381,000 tons of waste paper a year,
much of it high-quality paper, valuable when recycled.
   ``It is a national resource which must be reused. To do any less
would be to encourage a national disgrace.''
   White reported that Capitol Hill _ including Congress' hill
neighbors, the Library of Congress and the Supreme Court _ generate
20,000 tons of trash a year, much of it paper and only 10 percent of
it recycled.
   That amounts to roughly eight pounds a day for each of the 15,000
people who work for Congress.
   Because it is all lumped together it commands only $1 a ton from
recyclers. High quality paper, separated out, might go for $15 a
ton, he said.

   Rioters attacked a hydroelectric dam, shot up two
trains and assaulted Interior Ministry troops to steal weapons in
ethnic violence in the Black Sea resort region of Abkhazia, official
sources said Wednesday.
   Troops trying to restore order between warring bands of Georgians
and Abkhazians fought back, confiscating 40 pounds of explosives and
nearly 1,000 firearms, a Georgian official quoted the Tbilisi
newspaper Zarya Vostoka as saying.
   The death toll from five days of violence rose from 16 to 18 on
Wednesday, the official news agency Tass said. Hundreds have been
reported wounded.
   Thousands of vacationers were stranded as rioters cut off road
and rail transportation from the region 870 miles south of Moscow.
Authorities organized evacuation by sea and air.
   A man answering the phone at the Communist Party office in
Sukhumi, the region's capital, said troops were gaining the upper
hand on Wednesday following imposition of a state of emergency,
which included a curfew.
   The man said shooting stopped in Sukhumi on Wednesday. But the
line was cut off before he could give his name or further details.
   Abkhazians are a minority in their homeland, a so-called
autonomous republic inside the southern republic of Georgia. Both
Abkhazians and Georgians claim ethnic discrimination by the other.
   Mobs of more than 100 people have attacked troops and citizens
``for the purpose of seizing arms and ammunition,'' Tass said
Wednesday.
   Tass said a highway patrolman was fatally shot on the coastal
highway. Gunmen also shot up two passenger trains in Sukhumi, said
Tass, adding that no one was injured.
   On Monday, an armed band attacked the Inguri Hydroelectric
Station in the mountains near Djvari and cut off the power to some
districts before ``police restored the situation'' and posted
guards, the Tbilisi newspaper said.
   Tass described food shortages as acute in some areas. The
newspaper said 69 trains were stuck in Sukhumi and in the Georgian
capital of Tbilisi because Abkhazians had ripped up a section of
track and striking railroad workers in Sukhumi refused to repair it.
   Authorities reinforced the Interior Ministry troops, raising the
total dispatched to the region to 4,500 soldiers and 2,000
policemen, said the newspaper account, which was read over the
telephone by Gizo Grzeledze of the Georgian Foreign Ministry.
   The government daily, Izvestia, reported 30 people arrested for
violating the 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew imposed Tuesday night.
   ``Active measures are being taken to identify and arrest
troublemakers and organizers of the unrest and to confiscate weapons
and explosives from the population,'' Tass said.
   Demonstrators at meetings in Gali, Ochamchira, Tkvarcheli and
Gulripshe called on crowds to arm themselves and take action, the
Tbilisi newspaper reported. In Gali, a village with a population of
13,500 in 1970, 10,000 people gathered to hear reports of extensive
casualties among Georgians, the newspaper said.
   Georgian Communist Party chief Givi Gumbaridze and Abkhazian
party leader Vladimir Khishba went on local TV, which had been off
the air for several days, to appeal for calm.
   Tass quoted them as telling viewers, ``We have lost our minds if
we raise our hands, brother against brother, neighbor against
neighbor, if rage blinds our eyes.''
   Gumbaridze and other senior Georgian leaders met with groups to
try to ease tensions, and a commission was formed to investigate the
cause of the rioting.
   ``Many leaders of Abkhazia were blamed for serious violations of
political and ideological work, inertia, and lack of initiative,''
Tass said of the meetings.
   An Abkhazian official said the rioting was touched off by new
rules that would split the state university in Sukhumi into Georgian
and Abkhazian sections.
   For months, Abkhazians have been pressing for their region to
secede from Georgia and become the 16th Soviet republic, giving it
more political and economic autonomy.
   In April, ethnic conflicts in Abkhazia set off demonstrations in
Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, that developed into demands for
Georgian independence from the Soviet Union.
   Soldiers crushed the protests and at least 20 people were killed.

<DATELINE>GREENFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Several hundred protesters lined the
street around the Internal Revenue Service office Wednesday as tax
agents tried to auction the home of a pair of tax resisters.
   The only bidders were the protesters, who offered to trade
$21,414 in food and donated services to the poor for the home of
Randall Kehler, a founder of the Nuclear Freeze campaign, and his
wife, Betsy Corner. The couple has refused to pay federal taxes for
12 years to protest government spending on the military.
   The protesters' bid was rejected and the government acquired the
home for the minimum bid of $5,100.
   ``Food is not legal tender,'' said Robert Ruttenberg, an IRS
spokesman.
   The donated canned goods filled a truck parked outside the IRS
office.
   ``We feel good that this community is making a statement about
where our resources ought to be going and that is to support our
communities and feed the poor, not to build weapons and destroy the
planet,'' Kehler said.
   According to Ruttenberg, the couple owes about $27,000 in back
taxes.
   Kehler said that instead of paying taxes, he and his wife have
filed returns and donated the money they owed to local charities and
peace groups. They have continued to pay state and local taxes, he
said.
   ``The first year we had a taxable income was in 1977,'' he said.
``We would haaxes before any eviction proceedings can be
started against them and their 9-year-old daughter. Kehler said he
and his family won't pay and won't go quietly.
   ``We will refuse to cooperate with any eviction and non-violently
occupy our own home,'' he said.
   Ruttenberg said the number of tax resisters protesting military
spending has dropped to about 5,000 from about 22,000 in the early
1980s.
   ``If they want to change the law, let them elect people that will
do that,'' he said. ``But they are breaking the law and doing it at
the expense of other people, who have to pay their freight for
Social Secuirty and food stamp programs.''

<TEXT>
   A soldier in an elite infantry battalion
committed suicide and another shot himself in the foot to escape
brutality from fellow troops, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
   The daily Hadashot said both incidents occurred in a single
platoon. The unit, it said, was dominated by ``former criminals''
who beat recruits and gave orders to officers who were too
intimidated to discipline them.
   The commander of the Givati battalion, which often is used to
suppress Palestinian riots in the occupied Gaza Strip, said reports
of abuse in the unit were exaggerated, Hadashot and the independent
Haaretz reported.
   A military spokesman would not confirm details of the reports.
But the spokesman said the platoon's commander, deputy commander and
three non-commissioned officers were dismissed several months ago
and the platoon disbanded.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules,
also said the head of southern command, Maj. Gen. Matan Vilnai, met
with Givati commanders ``in connection with recent incidents'' but
would not elaborate.
   Platoons in the Israeli army generally have about 20 soldiers.
   The soldier who shot himself in the foot was tried before a
military court and given a three-month suspended sentence for
unauthorized use of his weapon, the newspapers reported.
   He was identified only as a resident of the Negev desert town of
Ofakim.
   Hadashot said that during the trial it was disclosed that another
soldier in the platoon committed suicide, but gave no details.
   ``The picture painted by the accused was described by one judge
as a Sodom and Gomorrah,'' Haaretz reported.
   ``The accused described to us a situation where his unit is ruled
by soldiers with criminal backgrounds, who act violently toward
anyone who does not submit to their will,'' Haaretz quoted the court
decision as saying.
   Haaretz said soldiers in the platoon beat recruits and abandoned
their guardposts, but the newspaper gave no other details of
brutality.
   ``We wonder how such a unit will stand up when it is called to
battle,'' it said.
   The commander of Givati, identified only as Col. Y., told the
newspapers the soldier's testimony was incorrect, but confirmed
there were problems in the unit.
   ``I personally dismissed the platoon commander and the unit
commander for their lack of control over the soldiers,'' he said.
   He accused the court of being unnecessarily harsh and added: ``We
are talking about an elite unit that is doing difficult work in the
(occupied) territories and in Lebanon and to come today and dirty
their names in not reasonable.''
   It was not the first time Givati troops were accused in court of
brutality.
   In May, a military court convicted four Givati soldiers of abuse
and sentenced them to nine months in jail for beating a Palestinian
refugee in Gaza with their rifle butts and a broomstick. The Arab
died of later beatings he received from other soldiers, the court
said.

   South Africa's administrator in Namibia
on Wednesday announced the release of 24 political prisoners and a
reduced role for some police.
   The moves by Namibia's top official, Louis Pienaar, are likely to
reduce tensions in the territory as it heads toward independence
after 74 years of South African rule.
   Pienaar made the announcement after he met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar conferred for two hours
Wednesday.
   ``We are now, broadly speaking, back on track for elections in
early November,'' said Perez de Cuellar.
   However, he also acknowledged potential obstacles: ``It is
perhaps inevitable that after so many years of conflict, fears and
distrust should persist, but they should not be allowed to
continue.''
   Pienaar said: ``I am completely satisfied in the manner in which
the meeting was conducted.''
   He said the 24 men to be freed Thursday are considered the last
political prisoners in Namibia. However, he said he decided against
releasing eight men convicted or accused of political violence.
   Pienaar previously linked the freeing of political prisoners to
the release of people he believes are being held by the South-West
Africa People's Organization.
   The group, known as SWAPO, waged a 23-year guerrilla war against
South African rule of Namibia. It is now the favorite in
pre-independence elections set for November.
   South Africa agreed in December to carry out the U.N.
independence plan under terms of a regional peace accord. Under the
U.S.-brokered pact, South Africa also pledged to halt aid to
guerrillas battling the Angolan government.
   In exchange, the agreement stipulated that the estimated 50,000
Cuban troops supporting the Angolan government would be withdrawn.
   Pienaar said he changed his mind about freeing prisoners when
Perez de Cuellar assured him the United Nations would seek the
return to Namibia of all SWAPO detainees.
   SWAPO has said it released all 201 of its detainees in April.
However, only 153 returned to Namibia two weeks ago, and on
Wednesday they released a list of 439 people they say still are held
in southern Angola.
   Pienaar also said he would deploy to less-tense regions policemen
who previously belonged to a counterinsurgency unit known as
Koevoet, the Afrikaans word for ``crowbar.''
   Many of Koevoet's estimated 3,000 members were integrated into
the regular police force after the unit was officially disbanded in
January.
   Koevoet has been accused of dozens of atrocities in northern
Namibia, where most of the bush war was fought. SWAPO says former
Koevoet members, who are mostly black Namibians, continue to harass
its supporters.
   Pienaar also said U.N. police monitors in northern Namibia will
be encouraged to accompany local police patrols.
   The United Nations has more than 5,000 soldiers and police in the
territory, but their role is largely supervisory.
   Perez de Cuellar also met with members of 10 political factions.
   He was quoted as saying the vigorous election campaign was
heartening evidence that political leaders are working for national
unity.
   ``Namibia will need all of its people, all their skills and
resources ... when it stands before the world as an independent
state,'' he said.
   Pienaar also said one unresolved issue concerns his charges that
1,900 SWAPO fighters are massed in Angola near the Namibian border.
SWAPO denies the charges.
   The U.N. chief is to visit several northern towns Thursday to
examine security and observe the ongoing repatriation of 41,000
Namibian refugees. On Friday, he heads to South Africa for talks
with government leaders.

<HEAD>Minister Says Countdown to U.S. Remove Bases Still in Force</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday that
Washington must dismantle U.S. bases in Greece next year without a
new defense pact, even though talks on such an agreement have been
frozen.
   A five-year agreement signed by the previous Socialist
administration expired last year.
   ``The issue of the U.S. bases in Greece is frozen ... but the
17-month countdown which began last December for the Americans to
remove the bases if a new agreement was not signed is still in
force,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister George Papoulias.
   The agreement specified that the United States would remove its
four major military installations at the end of the time limit
without a new agreement.
   The last of at least 15 rounds of negotiations on a new accord
ended in May.
   A temporary governing coalition of conservatives and leftists has
said it will avoid national issues, including the bases matter, and
instead leave them for the new government to result from elections
in October.
   The coalition was formed after the June 18 vote failed to give
any one party a majority in the 300-member one-chamber parliament.
   The temporary government has said it will deal mainly with
scandals surrounding officials of the defeated Socialist
administration.
   Two of the U.S. bases are on the Aegean island of Crete, where
the 6th Fleet refuels and the Air Force maintains a communications
station. The Navy also has a listening post and the Air Force a
support group in the Athens area.

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo on Wednesday
dismissed or reassigned six Cabinet ministers and fired his
intelligence chief, but the opposition denounced the moves as merely
cosmetic.
   The changes were not expected to alter government policies. They
were widely seen as political housekeeping moves to try to reassure
citizens that the governing Democratic Justice Party is concerned
about social unrest, rising crime and welfare problems.
   Opposition leaders said Roh had ignored the public's desire for a
complete change to erase the legacies of disgraced former president
Chun Doo-hwan. He left office in 1988 and later went into rural
exile after apologizing for abuses during his regime.
   Most of Roh's 23-member Cabinet worked in some capacity under the
Chun government.
   Wednesday's shake-up involved home, construction, communications,
labor, and health-social affairs ministers as well as the first
minister of state for political affairs.
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and the other 16 ministers were
retained. In the last Cabinet changes in December 1988, Kang and 19
ministers were appointed.
   The most noticeable action Wednesday was the dismissal of Park
Seh-jik as head of the main government intelligence organization,
the Agency for National Security Planning. Park was replaced by
former Attorney General Suh Dong-kwon.
   Park, a former army general who served as chief organizer of the
1988 Seoul Olympics, was held responsible for his agency's failure
to detect a series of secret visits to communist North Korea by
South Korean dissident leaders.
   Under South Korea's anti-communist law, unauthorized visits to
the communist North are a crime.
   The largest opposition group, the Party for Peace and Democracy,
said Roh had filled his cabinet with hard-liners associated with his
disgraced predecessor.
   The party focused on the choice of Suh as intelligence chief.
``He (Suh) was in the vanguard of the government's suppression of
political opposition and dissent'' while in his legal post, said
party spokesman Lee Sang-soo.
   Lee said the Cabinet change ``ignored the people's ardent desires
for further democratization and liquidation of human rights abuses
and corruption'' under Chun.
   Lee In-che, spokesman for the second largest opposition group,
Reunification Democratic Party, said the changes were ``not adequate
to satisfy the people's anticipation of renovation in government.''
He said the public had anticipated a shake-up that would include the
premiership.
   In other changes announced Wednesday, National Assemblyman Kim
Tae-ho of the governing was made home minister, succeeding Lee
Han-dong.
   Kwon Yong-gack, president of the state-run Korea Housing Corp.
and a retired army general, became construction minister.
   Former governing party lawmaker Kim Chong-in was made health and
social affairs minister, Communications Minister Choi Young-choul
was reassigned as labor minister, and former President Lee Woo-chae
of the state-run Korea Telecommunications Authority took over Choi's
old post.
   Park Chul-un, a special presidential assistant on political
matters, was named first minister of state for political affairs.

   Housing starts, led by a steep rise in
apartment building, rebounded 7 percent in June as interest rates
fell, the government reported Wednesday, but analysts said
single-family construction would remain weak as the economy
continues to slow.
   New homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 1.4 million units last month, up from 1.31 million
units in May when construction fell 2.5 percent, the Commerce
Department reported.
   While June's increase was the highest since an 8.6 percent hike
to 1.51 million units in February 1988, it reflected a 28 percent
rise in apartment construction, the highest since a 43 percent
increase in April 1988.
   Single-family construction fell in June for the third straight
month, prompting David Seiders, chief economist for the National
Association of Home Builders, to say this sector of the housing
market is ``still in a bit of the doldrums'' because of both
interest rates and the economy.
   ``Builders are extremely cautious,'' said chief economist David
Berson of the Federal National Mortgage Association. ``They're
waiting to make sure the decline in interest rates leads to a
sustained increase in single-family sales.''
   The housing industry had been among the sectors of the economy
hardest hit as interest rates edged upward over the past year while
the Federal Reserve sought to restrain economic growth and contain
inflation.
   But as inflation seemed to slow, fixed rate mortgages had fallen
to 10.07 percent by the end of June from a peak of 11.22 percent in
March and analysts began looking for a pickup in housing activity.
   Seiders, however, said Wednesday's report was not a signal that
interest rates have revived the housing industry.
   ``The really interest-sensitive part is single-family
construction, where we saw a bit of a decline,'' he said, adding
that another reason for the decline ``is the slowing economy which
will leave housing rather weak for the rest of the year.''
   Economist John Tuccillo of the National Association of Realtors
called the weak single-family sector a reflection of the health of
the residential construction market.
   Construction of single-family homes fell 2 percent in June to an
annual rate of 975,000 units, the lowest level since August 1984
when 967,000 units were started. Single-family construction fell 5.1
percent in May and 4.7 percent in April.
   Apartment construction, on the other hand, rose last month to an
annual rate of 425,000 units. But this sector often is volatile:
construction of multifamily units had risen 2.6 percent in May after
falling 26.6 percent in April.
   Tuccillo saw two other disturbing factors: ``a disproportionate
volume of activity in the West'' and a decrease in applications for
building permits.
   The West posted a 21.4 percent increase in starts to 443,000
units on a seasonally adjusted annual rate. The South also
registered an increase, up 5.8 percent to 548,000 units.
   But the Northeast had a 5 percent decrease to 171,000 units while
Midwestern starts were down 3.3 percent to 238,000 units.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future
multifamily housing activity, were down 3.5 percent, following
increases of 1 percent in May and 8.5 percent in April. They had
fallen the three previous months, however.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady rejected on
Tuesday a suggestion that the Paris economic summit last week
signified a retreat by the United States from its position since the
end of World War II as the leader in world economic affairs.
   ``I don't think we have the passing of the baton yet, but it is a
serious worry,'' Brady told the Joint Economic Committee of
Congress. ``The fiscal pressures we are under certainly do
circumscribe our ability to flesh out that leadership with the
presentation of funds.''
   On another issue, Brady repeated the administration's intent to
open talks with Congress on a fiscal budget for 1991 opposing a tax
increase. But, despite prodding by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., he
declined to categorically rule out the possibility of a tax increase.
   ``Certainly the 1990 budget was put togehter with that in mind
and that's what happened,'' Brady said. ``We would begin with that
same process in 1991. The president's position is quite clear and
that obviously is my position.''
   In response to questions on the significance of the summit, Brady
said U.S. inablity to ``come up with its prescribed and agreed-to''
contributions to the World Bank and other multinational agencies has
become ``a source of embarrassment in worldwide forums.''
   Brady made the assessment after the committee's chairman, Rep.
Lee Hamiltion, D-Ind., noted that President Bush offered ``a very
modest'' $125 million to encourage fragile democratic and free
market economic movements in Poland and Hungary.
   Cleaning up the environment and relieving the debt burdens
depressing Third World countries were the other two primary topics
of the summit, but Hamilton noted the United States offered no new
economic help for either.
   ``If you look at the areas which seemed to dominate the summit,
in all cases, it seems to me, American funds simply were not
available in large quantity,'' Hamiltion said.
   Brady noted that Japan, with a pledge of $65 billion, has assumed
the leadership in sharing the burden of Third World debt reduction.
   ``We have to give credit where credit is due,'' he said. ``They
have come forth with hard money to support the debt strategy.''
   But he complained that other countries with large surpluses _
West Germany and Taiwan _ have offered little help.
   Brady said he also expects an agreement ``reasonably soon''
between private banks and Mexico in the first test of his plan for
nudging private banks into forgiving large protions of the $1.3
trillion debt owed by developing countries.
   Endorsement of his plan by the heads of state of the six other
industrial powers _ Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Canada and
Japan _ puts more pressure on the banks to negotiate debt-reduction
agreementsm, he said.
   Several members of Congress have expressed skepticism about the
workability of the plan and its reliance on government-backed
guarantees to cover interest payments to the private banks on the
remaining balances.
   The administration had sought to put some of those fears to rest,
hoping to announce at the summit an agreement in which Mexico's 15
creditor banks agreed to a 30 percent to 40 percent reduction in the
$54 billion they are owed by its government. No announcement was
made.
   ``I wish it were going faster, but these negotiations are very
complicated and take a long time,'' Brady said Tuesday. ``I think
we're going to get resolution reasonably soon.''
   ``And when we do get it,'' he said, ``I think everybody will feel
relieved that the first transaction has taken place and other ones
will follow much more quickly because we know how to do it.''
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., questioned whether private banks in
other countries were resisting the debt-reduction efforts in the
belief that their governments were not as supportive of Brady's plan
as the United States.
   Brady said the significance of the summit was that the issue has
now been ``kicked upstairs to the head-of-state level.''
   Last April, a month after the plan was revealed, it received a
qualified endorsement from the finance ministers of the six other
industrial powers.

   Keeler, on a tour to promote the movie ``Scandal,'' which is

   The tabloids, she complained, always make her appear ``a vice

   Cabinet Secretary Louis Sullivan on Wednesday
backed away from supporting local needle-exchange programs to help
stem the spread of AIDS and told Congress the Bush administration
opposes such programs.
   The health and human services secretary said that after talking
with AIDS and drug abuse experts and members of Congress, he
believes ``at this time there is insufficient scientific evidence to
conclude that needle-exchange programs are effective in curbing the
spread of the AIDS virus.''
   He also said the administration is opposed because of concern
that programs that provide clean needles to drug addicts ``could be
viewed as sanctioning IV drug abuse.
   ``We await better solutions to the twin scourges of AIDS and IV
drug abuse,'' he told the subcommittee.
   Sullivan's comments during a more than two-hour appearance before
the House Energy and Commerce health subcommittee were a departure
from statements he made in an interview with The Association Press
in March.
   In the interview, the secretary said he did ``not subscribe to
the view that it (needle exchange) condones drug abuse.'' He also
said that while he did not favor a federal needle-exchange program
because of strong opposition in some communities, the federal
government could provide trained health officials and other support
for communities that want such programs.
   He said in March: ``It is an idea that certainly deserves some
investigation to see if it does work, and if it does then that would
then strengthen those other communities where there is concern that
it is sending the wrong message.''
   He told members of the subcommittee: ``We want to gather all the
information that we can about these programs, and because of the
fact that there has not been evidence, clear evidence that these
programs are effective, we are not prepared to advocate or come
forth with programs.''
   Sullivan's ealier statements alarmed some in the Bush
administration, including drug czar William Bennett, who opposes
needle exchange programs. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Bush ``is opposed to exchangeable needles under any condition.''
   Sullivan said his department planned no efforts to conduct its
own evaluation of the effectiveness of needle-exchange programs, but
he said the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which is part of HHS,
would consider applications for research grants for such an
evaluation.
   However, he said it will be difficult to develop an effective
methodology.
   Pressed by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., subcommittee chairman,
Sullivan agreed to convene a panel of scientists to determine how
the effectiveness of these programs can be evaluated scientifically.
Waxman asked Sullivan to report back to the subcommittee with the
panel's recommendations.
   Needle-exchange programs are under way in England, Australia,
Sweden and the Netherlands, as well as several U.S. cities,
including New York City, Tacoma, Wash., and Boulder, Colo.
   Sullivan said the studies evaluating the effectiveness of some of
these programs ``is not convincing'' because none has compared a
group of addicts receiving clean needles with a group that is not.
Also, it is not clear whether findings that show decreased needle
sharing and no increase in drug abuse are resulting from other
factors, he said.
   At a hearing in April, the subcommittee heard from officials of
three needle-exchange programs who said their programs were
effective in reducing the spread of AIDS.
   Several Democrats on the subcommittee who believe needle-exchange
programs should be looked into as a possible tool in the fight
against the AIDS epidemic were clearly frustrated by Sullivan's
new-found opposition to the such programs and questioned the
administration's commitment to fighting AIDS.
   ``Where are the strategies?'' asked Rep. James Scheuer, a
Democrat from New York City, which has more AIDS cases than any
other U.S. city. ``Your statement reflects your cool and thoughtful
style, but there's no urgency there.''

   Measles vaccinations are being recommended for as
many as 100 million people 32 or younger, and two doses of vaccine
are being urged for children after reports of measles outbreaks in
18 states.
   The recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and
the Centers for Disease Control were prompted by an estimated 350
percent increase in measles cases nationwide this year, Dr. William
Atkinson, an epidemiologist at the CDC in Atlanta, said Wednesday.
   CDC figures show that 7,563 measles cases have been reported
nationwide this year through July 9, compared to 1,586 cases during
the same period last year.
   It's the worst outbreak in nine years, Atkinson said.
   Measles hits most often in winter, and most outbreaks wind down
with the onslaught of mid-summer heat, he said.
   ``It's primarily inner-city black and Hispanic children who don't
get into the health-care system very easily'' who are affected,
Atkinson said.
   The disease _ characterized by a high fever, cough and rash _ is
extremely contagious and generally more severe in adults.
   Most children are routinely vaccinated when they are about 15
months old, but vaccines produced before 1980 are less resistant to
heat and often less potent, said Dr. Martha Lepow, a member of the
academy's Committee on Infectious Diseases.
   The academy and the CDC both say immunization efforts should be
aimed at school-age children, the group most affected by the current
outbreaks.
   The academy recommends children be given combined vaccinations
for measles, mumps and rubella, or German measles, at 15 months of
age and again when they enter middle school or junior high.
   The organization, based in suburban Elk Grove Village, also
recommends revaccination for anyone entering college, adults in
health-care professions and adults 32 or younger who live in a
region where there's an outbreak, said Ms. Lepow.
   Most people over 32 contracted measles during epidemics that hit
the country before 1957 and are naturally immune, Atkinson said.
   Atkinson said the CDC supports the academy's recommendations and
will issue similar guidelines within the next few months.
   The CDC believes that anyone 32 or younger who hasn't had measles
_ roughly 100 million people _ should be revaccinated, he said.
   The academy's policy also does not apply to anyone who has had
measles, said Ms. Lepow, a professor of pediatrics at Albany Medical
College in Albany, N.Y.
   In high-risk areas, children should be vaccinated at 12 months of
age, the academy says. Those vaccinated before their first birthday
should have a second vaccination at 15 months, and a third upon
entry to middle and junior high school.
   Children under 1 often don't respond to the vaccine, Ms. Lepow
said.
   The academy formerly recommended a single dose at age 15 months,
and did not have a revaccination policy for those school age and
older except in the cases of outbreaks.
   No unusual reactions have been associated with revaccination, the
academy said in a news release, but noted that women should not be
pregnant when receiving the vaccine or for three months afterwards.
   About 60 outbreaks in 45 states have been reported this year,
Atkinson said.
   Outbreaks are considered active in 18 states, he said. The CDC
defines an outbreak as five or more cases believed to be linked in a
specified area.
   Texas has been the hardest hit, with 1,800 cases reported so far
in Houston alone, he said.
   Other states where outbreaks are considered active are: Alabama,
Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky,
Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Utah and Wisconsin.

seven helicopters.
   The plane landed just short of the runway at Davis Field in

   Army spokesmen on the scene said the skin on the plane's right
side was damaged and the aircraft's wheel wells were damaged.
   A spokeswoman for the Army's Joint Readiness Training Center at
Fort Chaffee, Ark., said the soldiers, members of the Army's 6th
Infantry at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, were being flown to Davis Field

at Davis before taking the soldiers and their equipment to Fort
Chaffee.
   The aircraft was flown by members of the 60th Military Airlift

<TEXT>
   Contract negotiations between the United
Mine Workers and The Pittston Co. got off to a rocky start Wednesday
and the union accused the nation's largest coal exporter of being
inflexible.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said Pittston refuses to negotiate
in good faith and will not rescind what it calls its final offer,
which the union rejected last month.
   ``They want us to be flexible but they don't want to be,'' union
spokesman Joe Corcoran said.
   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom said Wednesday on
``CBS This Morning'' that the company is standing by its previous
contract proposal.
   ``At this point the movement will have to come from the union,''
Odom said. ``We have our proposal on the table.
   ``We feel our proposal recognized the dynamics of the coal market
we operate in ... we feel our proposal would put people back to
work.''
   Trumka said Odom's appearance on the show put the union in a sour
mood.
   ``How can the mood be good when they get on TV and say how
inflexible they are?''
   About 1,900 UMW miners are on strike at Pittston operations in
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky. The Virginia and West Virginia
miners went on strike in early April and the Kentucky miners
followed in June.
   Up to 46,000 miners in 10 states had been off the job in sympathy
with the Pittston miners until Monday, when most returned to work at
Trumka's urging. Isolated pockets of striking wildcat miners remain,
most in West Virginia.
   Wednesday's negotiations were conducted from separate rooms with
federal mediators shuttling messages between them.
   Corcoran said one of the main sticking points is Pittston's
insistence on ending its contributions to the 1950 UMW retirement
fund, which covers 130,000 pensioners who retired between 1947 and
1976.
   Pittston, which has 560 retirees covered by the fund, said it
doesn't want to contribute to pensions received by retirees of other
companies.
   Corcoran said the 1950 fund was established so miners who went
from company to company when mines shut down could have pensions.
   ``You're talking about guys who worked for eight or 10 different
companies, and when they retired, they wouldn't have a pension
because they didn't work for one company long enough,'' Corcoran
said.
   If Pittston pulls out of the retirement fund, he said, other
companies will want to do the same, which would put the burden on
the federal government.

   Powers once concentrated in Poland's
collective Council of State on Wednesday pass to the presidency, a
new post with a wide range of domestic and foreign policy duties.
   The president is elected by the National Assembly, a joint
meeting of the 460-member Sejm, or parliament, and the 100-seat
Senate. To be elected, a candidate must receive a majority of the
votes, with at least half the National Assembly present.
   On Wednesday, communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski was
elected to the post.
   The presidency is part of the historic deal reached in April
between communist authorities and the opposition that legalized the
independent Solidarity trade union after a seven-year ban in
exchange for opposition support of partially free elections.
   The unstated purpose of the new office is to guarantee a period
of communist control while democratic political reforms and economic
changes are under way.
   The president, the highest representative of the Polish state, is
elected for a six years and can serve only one subsequent term. Any
Polish citizen who meets the requirements to be elected to the Sejm
may be a candidate for president, but he need not be a member of the
parliament.
   The president's duties previously were carried out by the Council
of State, which was created in 1952 and will cease to exist.
   The Council of State included top members of the communist
coalition led by a chairman who was sometimes referred to as
president of the council. However, real power rested with the ruling
Politburo led by the first secretary of the communist party.
   Jaruzelski has headed the Council of State since 1985. Previous
presidents of the council included Henryk Jablonski from 1972 to
1985 and Jozef Cyrankiewicz from 1970 to 1972.
   The new president will be the sixth in modern Polish history,
which dates from 1918 when the country regained its independence.
   Although Poland had an elected president before World War II, the
real head of state during most of the interwar period was a man
never elected to the post.
   Marshall Jozef Pilsudski proclaimed the Polish state at the end
of World War I and secured its independence by defeating the Soviet
army in 1920, wielding powers over defense and foreign policy
similar to that of the new presidency.
   Pilsudski had the title of ``state leader'' until he retired from
public life in 1922. He seized power again in a 1926 coup and held
it until his death in 1935. For most of that time, he held no formal
title but was the country's acknowledged strongman.
   The first president, Gabriel Narutowicz, was assassinated after
only one week in office in 1922. There were two more presidents
until the start of World War II in 1939 and one president of the
London government-in-exile during the war.
   The only president after World War II was Boleslaw Bierut, the
pro-Stalin communist chief. He held the office from 1947 until 1952,
until the office was dropped from the constitution.
   One of the president's first tasks will be to nominate a new
prime minister who will then be asked to form a government. The Sejm
must approve the prime minister and his cabinet.
   The president can veto legislation passed by the Sejm, but can be
overriden by a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
   The president ratifies and cancels international agreements and
is reponsible for defense in the Warsaw Pact nation.
   He has the right to introduce martial law as required by a
foreign threat to state security and he can proclaim a partial or
universal mobilization of the armed forces for the same reason.
   The president can also introduce a state of emergency as a result
of an internal security threat to the country for a period of up to
three months without consent of the National Assembly. The state of
emergency can be extended by another three months with National
Assembly approval.
   During the state of emergency, the president cannot dissolve the
Sejm, nor can constitutional or electoral changes be introduced.
   The president does have the right to dissolve the National
Assembly and call new elections if the legislature fails to form a
government or pass a national budget or if legislation is passed
making it impossible for the president to perform his constitutional
duties.
   The president will sit in a large wooden chair that has been
waiting in the balcony of the National Assembly since members of the
Sejm and the Senate were elected a month ago in Poland's freest
voting for four decades.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Up a Bit With Food Costs Increases Leveling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer prices rose a modest 0.2 percent in
June, the smallest advance since early last year, the government
said Wednesday in a report that bolstered the view that inflationary
pressures are beginning to ease.
   The slowdown in the Consumer Price Index reflected the fact that
energy and food costs, which had been shooting upward this year,
finally moderated last month. Energy costs actually fell while food
prices edged up by the smallest amount in seven months.
   Even with the June price moderation, consumer prices for the
first six months of the year rose at an annual rate of 5.9 percent,
the sharpest increase for the first half of a year since 1982.
   The Bush administration hailed Wednesday's report as ``very good
news'' that the country is not headed for another inflationary
spiral.
   ``We remain confident in the ability of the economy to sustain
its growth while controlling and ultimately reducing inflation,''
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, told reporters at the White House.
   Many private economists were just as upbeat, saying the inflation
report could not have come at a better time for Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who must testify before Congress on
Thursday about the progress the central bank is making in
controlling price pressures.
   ``This is about as good as one could ask for on the inflation
front right now, particularly when you think back to six months aso
when everyone was fearful that we had run-away inflation,'' said
David Jones, economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York.
   The report on consumer prices was the second good signal on
inflation. Last Friday, the Labor Department said that wholesale
prices actually fell in June, their first decline in 18 months.
   In another report Wednesday, the Commerce Department said that
housing construction rebounded 7 percent in June, the biggest
one-month increase in 16 months, to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 1.40 million units.
   Analysts said the upturn in new homes and apartments reflected
the hopes of builders that mortgage rates will be headed lower as
the central bank turns its attention from fighting inflation to
keeping the country out of a recession.
   Responding to widespread signs of an economic slowdown, the Fed
has already made two small moves toward loosening credit conditions
in the past seven weeks and analysts predicted further easing steps
in the months ahead.
   ``The CPI report suggests that there is no great acceleration in
inflation going on,'' said David Wyss, senior financial economist at
DRI-McGraw Hill, an economic consulting firm. ``I think we are going
to see much better numbers on inflation in the second half of the
year, mainly because of improvement in food and energy prices.''
   At the beginning of the year, energy costs shot up at an annual
rate of 40.3 percent, reflecting the worldwide run-up in crude oil
prices.
   However, energy prices at the consumer level actually fell by 1
percent in June, the biggest decline since a 1.9 percent drop in
October 1986, another period when a rapid run-up in petroleum costs
was followed by a price rollback.
   The cost of gasoline at the pump dropped by 1 percent while home
heating oil, natural gas and electricity costs were down as well
last month.
   Food costs, which had been climbing at the fastest pace since
1980, slowed in June to just a 0.2 percent increase, the smallest
advance since last November.
   After surging by 3.2 percent in May, the cost of fruits and
vegetables declined 1 percent in June. Prices of beef, port and
dairy products fell as well.
   While food and energy costs played a major role in the inflation
slowdown, prices excluding these two categories also showed
moderation, increasing just 0.2 percent.
   Clothing costs fell 1.1 percent in June, after increasing 2.3
percent in the first five months of the year, with the big decline
coming from bigger than usual end-of-season price markdowns,
especially in women's clothing.
   Medical costs rose 0.7 percent in June, the biggest advance for
any of the major categories, with doctors' costs, hospital costs and
prescription drug costs all rising sharply.
   The various changes in June left the overall Consumer Price Index
at 124.1 of its 1982-84 base. That means that a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 during the base period would have
cost $124.10 in June.
   In a separate report today, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, were
unchanged in June after falling 1.4 percent in May.

   Four-star Adm. Means Johnston Jr., who
commanded all NATO forces in Southern Europe, was buried with full
military honors Wednesday at Arlington National Cemetery.
   Johnston, 73, a native of Greenwood, Miss., was eulogized at a
memorial service by retired Adm. Thomas Moorer, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Moorer called Johnston's death ``an extreme loss not only for his
family and friends, but for the whole country.
   ``He was a professional naval officer in every sense of the
word,'' Moorer said, adding that ``his standards included everything
that has made this nation great.''
   Moorer, a long-time friend of Johnston's, also described him as
``a true Southern gentleman.''
   After the service, Johnston's flag-draped casket was brought into
the cemetery atop a caisson drawn by six white horses, accompanied
by a four-member color guard, 20-piece band and 22-member ceremonial
guard.
   After the flag was carefully folded, it was presented by Navy
chaplain Stanley DeLong to Johnston's widow, Hope Manning Larkin
Johnston.
   Johnston, who lived in McLean, Va., a Washington suburb, died
last Friday at Walter Reed Army Hospital after a lengthy illness. He
was the son of the late Mr. and Mrs Means Johnston of Greenwood.
   Johnston achieved the rank of four-star admiral in 1973. He
retired in 1975 after 40 years of service in the Navy.

<HEAD>Mayor to Sign Bill Limiting Outside Income for Top City Officials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry said Wednesday that he will
sign a bill limiting outside income for top elected city officials
but denied it is an attempt to discourage Jesse Jackson from
entering the 1990 mayoral campaign.
   ``I think it's a good bill,'' Barry said. ``It doesn't affect me
_ I make enough money in this job.''
   The bill, passed last week by the District of Columbia Council,
places a $10,000 annual limit on honoraria for the mayor and the 13
members of the council. Some council members opposed the bill,
pointing out that Jackson earns much of his estimated $200,000
annual income from speeches and appearances. Barry earns $82,500 per
year.
   The bill was sponsored by council member John Ray, a declared
mayoral candidate. Council Chairman David Clarke, who also is
seeking the mayor's office, added an amendment placing a $10,000
yearly cap on book royalties for the mayor and council chairman.
   Barry denied that the bill was intended to discourage Jackson
from running and described it as ethics legislation. The mayor could
have vetoed the bill or allowed it to become law without his
signature.
   The mayor, however, sidestepped questions about whether he
anticipates having to run against Jackson and also refused to
comment on whether he expects Jackson to support his bid for an
unprecedented fourth term.
   ``God gave me a great brain _ I'm a smart politician,'' Barry
said. ``My timetable will not be decided by others.''
   Barry also refused to talk about a meeting he had with Jackson on
Tuesday at a downtown hotel. Jackson, who has said he is not running
for mayor but has declined to rule out an eventual run, met with
Barry and Walter Fauntroy, the district's non-voting congressional
delegate, for about 90 minutes.
   Barry described the session as a ``prayer meeting.'' Fauntroy
declined to comment on the meeting. Jackson was unavailable
Wednesday.
   The meeting came just hours after Jackson said he intended to
move his legal residence to Washington, a step which would allow him
to enter the mayor's race.

<HEAD>Bork Urges Amendment; Fried Opposes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rejected Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork on
Wednesday urged Congress to approve a constitutional amendment to
overcome the court's ruling that protects flag burning.
   ``The Supreme Court's 5-4 decision ... that flag burning is a
mode of expression protected by the First Amendment's guarantee of
the freedom o speech seems to me plainly wrong,'' Bork told the
constitutional law subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.
   Bork's testimony was no surprise to members of the panel but the
remarks of former Solicitor General Charles Fried caught them off
guard.
   Fried had been expected to say that a new statute protecting the
flag was possible, but he told the subcommittee he now agrees with
Bork that only a constitutional amendment would do the job _ and he
opposes both an amendment and a statute.
   The subcommittee began hearings last week on how to address last
month's ruling, which was quickly seized upon for denunciation by
politicians of both parties.
   President Bush is pushing a constitutional amendment while many
Democratic leaders, saying they fear harm to the Bill of Rights,
favor a carefully crafted statute to address the court's concerns.
   Bork, a former federal judge now at a Washington think tank, said
he saw little threat to constitutional freedoms.
   ``Putting out of bounds a few means of expression in no way
threatens the American system of free speech,'' he said.
   Bork said if his nomination by President Reagan in 1987 had been
approved the ruling would have gone the other way. Justice Anthony
M. Kennedy, whose nomination was approved after Bork was rejected by
the Senate, voted with the court majority in the case.
   Now, he argued, Congress should move swiftly to approve the
constitutional amendment, which would give Congress and the states
authority to prohibit physical desecration of the flag.
   The court would recognize a statute as ``intellectually
dishonest'' if it tried to ban flag burning and pretend that was not
an attempt to stifle expression, he said, adding, ``After several
years of litigation, we certainly would be right back where we are
today.''
   Fried was the Reagan administration's chief advocate before the
nation's highest court, and in that role he declined to enter the
flag-burning case.
   He has said he might have sought to enter the case if the statute
in question had been worded differently, and he had been expected to
tell the committee that a new statute could work. But he changed his
mind.
   Fried instead agreed with Bork and the Justice Department that a
constitutional amendment is the only way to overrule the court in
this case. The arguments against a statute were ``devastating,'' he
said.
   ``Whatever the technicalities, the evident purpose of such a
statute would still be to punish acts of expression,'' he said.
   However, Fried said he was dead against trying to overturn the
court.
   Fried recalled how he fled Czechoslovakia as a youngster and
became an American citizen, and told the panel that tolerance of
acts like flag-burning was what made America special.
   ``America, its traditions and values and its flag are important.
But foremost among those values is the principle that no one shall
be punished for his political expressions _ no matter how offensive
or bizarre,'' he said.
   ``That commitment to liberty is our first and greatest
contribution to the history of mankind,'' he said.
   ``I hope and urge and pray that we will not act, that no statute
be passed and of course that the Constitution not be amended. In
short, I believe the Johnson case is right not just as a matter of
present constitutional law, it is right in principle,'' he said.
   Democrats, whose strategy is to produce a statute in order to
cool the fervor for an amendment, told Fried it was too late to hope
for no action.
   Hope that Congress would let the court ruling stand was dashed
when President Bush traveled to the Iwo Jima memorial to announce
his support for the amendment, said the subcommittee chairman, Rep.
Don Edwards, D-Calif. ``The issue was taken away from us by the
president of the United States,'' he said.
   But Fried said that ``the games that are being played are so
transparent the court is going to see right through them.''
   He told the lawmakers, ``There are times when you can earn your
rather inadequate salaries by just doing the right thing ... It's
called leadership.''

<TEXT>
   Wendell ``Sonny'' Rawls, a Pulitzer Prize winner
who came to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution with editor Bill
Kovach, has left the newspapers eight months after Kovach's stormy
resignation.
   Newspaper officials also confirmed Wednesday that sports
columnist Dave Kindred has resigned.
   Rawls' departure as assistant managing editor for local news was
disclosed Wednesday in an article about plans for a movie about
Kovach's 23 months as editor.
   Journal-Constitution Editor Ron Martin declined to discuss
replacing Rawls or Kindred.
   The newspapers have not noted Kindred's departure, but his
sports-front column in the morning Constitution has been filled by
other staff columnists.
   Rawls is the last to leave of three New York Times veterans who
assumed top posts at the Atlanta newspapers. Kovach, who became
editor of the Journal-Constitution in December 1986, resigned in
November after skirmishes with corporate management. Dudley
Clendenin, hired by Kovach as assistant managing editor for
features, and John Mashek, national political correspondent, also
left.
   Rawls will cooperate with Atlanta novelist Pat Conroy, a Kovach
supporter, on the screenplay for the movie about Kovach.
   Under Kovach, the Journal-Constitution won a Pulitzer Prize for
reporter Bill Dedman's series on discriminatory lending in Atlanta
and shared another Pulitzer for the cartoons of Doug Marlette, hired
by Kovach from The Charlotte (N.C.) Observer.
   Dedman since has left the Journal-Constitution for The Washington
Post. Marlette has left to work for New York's Newsday.

<HEAD>US Wants Drug Data from Cuba</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has asked Cuban
authorities for the results of their investigation of drug smuggling
into the United States by Cuban military officers, the State
Department said Wednesday.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the administration is
interested in taking ``appropriate action'' based on whatever
information Cuban officials provide.
   No response has been received from Cuban authorities, Boucher
said.
   He acknowledged that there have been contacts recently between
Cuban and American officials but said that there have been no
discussions on formal cooperation in combatting drug smuggling.
   His statement was confirmed by Clinton Adlum, a spokesman for
Cuba's diplomatic mission here.
   The State Department has been wary about joint cooperation with
Cuba. There is uncertainty among U.S. officials as to whether the
recent trials of military officers charged with drug-related
offenses is part of a broader campaign in Cuba to halt use of that
nation's air space and territorial waters to ship illicit drugs to
U.S. markets.
   Some officials are concerned that the crackdown may be limited to
a small group of traffickers and that other drug smuggling
activities may be continuing with official acquiescence.
   Boucher said the United States is looking for a ``serious
effort'' by Cuba to end use of Cuban territory for U.S.-bound drug
shipments originating in Colombia.
   The United States wants Cuba ``to prosecute people, to
investigate allegations of complicity in drug trafficking and to
interdict trafficking through their air space and waters,'' Boucher
said.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro called last week for cooperation
between the United States and Cuba to curb drug trafficking.
   ``We need some way to communicate in this common battle,'' Castro
said in a speech. ``We need to talk to the Americans about how to
manage this situation.''
   He contended the United States had failed to warn him of Cuban
military involvement in cocaine trafficking, saying the United
States had ``at least two names'' of military officers involved in a
cocaine-trafficking conspiracy long before contacts in Colombia
alerted Cuban officials.
   Last Thursday, one of Castro's trusted advisors, Army Maj. Gen.
Arnaldo Ochoa Sanchez, and three other military officers were
executed for smuggling tons of drugs into the United States.
   Previously, Cuba had denied U.S. allegations that Cuba was being
used to smuggle cocaine and marijuana to the United States.

   Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski
was elected Wednesday to the country's powerful new presidency by a
slim margin in the National Assembly.
   Jaruzelski, the only candidate, was helped by a boycott by some
opposition lawmakers. The vote was 270 for, 233 against and 34
abstaining. There were 537 valid votes, and 269 were required to
win. The communist coalition has a 300-259 majority in the assembly.
   Government ministers gave one another a thumbs-up sign as word
spread through the chamber while the paper ballots were counted and
recounted.
   ``I state that Citizen Wojciech Jaruzelski has received the
required number of votes and has been elected by the National
Assembly to be the president of the Polish Peoples Republic,''
parliament speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz said after the vote.
   The post gives Jaruzelski, the Communist Party leader, control of
the military and foreign relations and allows him to nominate the
next prime minister. The office has a six-year term.
   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski nominated Jaruzelski earlier
today, saying no politician in Poland would be met with ``universal
approval'' but praising Jaruzelski as an advocate of national
reconciliation.
   Solidarity's parliamentary floor leader, Bronislaw Geremek,
neither endorsed nor opposed the nomination but said opposition
lawmakers could not forget Jaruzelski's 1981 martial-law decree that
was directed against the union.
   One by one, lawmakers filed up to a wooden box at the front of
the parliament chamber and deposited printed paper ballots with the
options, ``For,'' ``Against'' and ``Abstain.''
   Many held up ballots showing they were voting against Jaruzelski.
   ``I was and I am for Lech Walesa,'' said Senator Gabriel Janowski
said as he deposited his ballot against Jaruzelski.
   The voting took nearly 1{ hours. Votes were counted in the
presence of the lawmakers.
   As lawmakers gathered for the vote, about 50 anti-Jaruzelski
demonstrators from the Confederation for an Independent Poland
rallied outside. ``Jaruzelski Must Go,'' read one of their banners.
   After a long and emotional debate Tuesday, it had been expected
that most Solidarity lawmakers would vote against Jaruzelski, who
imprisoned many of them as he tried to crush their free trade union
movement with martial law.
   But some, while not forgiving the general for past repression,
argued that defeating him could undermine reforms needed to reverse
the country's economic decline.
   In addition to the Solidarity opposition, Jaruzelski faced
opposition in his own communist coalition, where some members are
openly sympathetic to Solidarity.
   Opposition leaders said they did not offer a presidential
candidate of their own because they believed that winning the
presidency would be unrealistic and could court a backlash from
communist hard-liners.
   In its editions today, the opposition Gazeta Wyborcza said in an
editorial that the country's new president would be ``a guarantor of
a stable course'' as Poland enters a transition period leading to
full democracy.
   Communist-controlled newspapers announced in banner headlines the
news that Jaruzelski _ citing ``a sense of duty'' _ had reversed a
June 30 decision eschewing the presidency and would run after all.
   The communist leadership asked him to reconsider.
   An announcement by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa that he would
cooperate with Jaruzelski as president and words of praise from
President Bush during a visit last week also appeared to have helped
persuade the general.
   Jaruzelski must deal with worsening food shortages and inflation
now headed for annual rate of 160 percent.
   The pressing economic problems have caused widespread discontent
and were the impetus behind the ruling communists' concessions to
Solidarity.
   In April, the free trade union movement was reinstated after a
seven-year ban and allowed to field candidates in June elections
that were the country's freest since the communists seized power
four decades ago.
   In parliament, where Solidarity won all but one of the seats it
was allowed to contest, the communist coalition has 300 of the 560
seats.
   In an apparent sign of growing discontent with climbing prices
and worsening shortages, 11,000 bus and streetcar drivers went on
strike Tuesday in the populous southern province of Katowice to
demand higher wages.

<UNK>Autopsy Inconclusive on Boy Who Died After Roller Coaster Ride</UNK>

<TEXT>
   An autopsy Wednesday failed to pinpoint what
killed a boy who collapsed while riding the Z-Force roller coaster
at the Six Flags Over Georgia amusement park.
   William D. ``Brett'' Pope, 11, of Talladega, Ala., was pronounced
dead Tuesday night about an hour after being taken off the ride,
which makes six sharp, corkscrew dives.
   The ride, which was shut down immediately, will remain closed
until park and state officials finish an investigation, said Six
Flags spokesman Bob Maxwell.
   ``The ride appears to be operating perfectly, but we won't take
any chances,'' Maxwell said.
   A preliminary autopsy by the Cobb County medical examiner's
office failed to find a cause of death, said medical examiner's
spokeswoman Sally Lummus.
   Doctors were still piecing together the child's medical history,
the spokeswoman said. Once that is completed, the body will be sent
to the state crime lab for further analysis, she said.
   Six Flags spokesman Bob Maxwell said the boy appeared fine when
he boarded the ride with his family at 9:40 p.m., but was
unconscious when the ride ended minutes later.
   Maxwell said park personnel used cardiopulmonary resuscitation
until an ambulance arrived to take the boy to HCA Parkway Medical
Center, where he was pronounced dead about an hour later.
   Hospital spokeswoman Mimi Salkin said the child showed no outward
signs of injury.
   The roller coaster carries a warning that pregnant women and
people with heart or back problems shouldn't ride.
   Maxwell said the operators of the ride and other passengers were
being interviewed to determine if anything unusual occurred, but no
other injuries were reported.
   He said the boy's shoulder harness and lap belt were in place
when the ride ended.
   Pope, the son of Ron and Sandra Pope of Talladega, had just
completed the fifth grade, relatives said. His parents declined to
talk about his death.

<HEAD>Study Says Reforms Have Slowed Rate of Illegal Immigration</HEAD>

   Employer sanctions against hiring undocumented
workers appear largely responsible for slowing the rate of illegal
immigration across the Mexican border, according to a study released
Wednesday.
   The study by researchers for the Urban Institute and Princeton
University said 71 percent of the decline in apprehensions along the
U.S.-Mexico border appears due to the ``deterrent effect'' of the
1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.
   Frank Bean of the Urban Institute and one of the study's authors,
said the sanctions against employers who hire undocumented workers
are the only real deterrent in the law, so ``it is not unrealistic
to think that most (of the deterrent effect) is due to sanctions, if
not all.''
   Dan Stein, executive director of the Federation for American
Immigration Reform, said the study provides the first major
empirical evidence that sanctions are effective.
   ``It shows that many people who don't have unbridled motivation
to get around the law are discouraged from coming. ... It is a
ratification of what we have been saying all along,'' Stein said.
   Using a statistical model, the study said the control act is
associated with a cumulative net reduction in apprehensions of
nearly 700,000 people, or 35 percent, below what would have been
anticipated if circumstances had not changed in the 23-month period
following the law's enactment in November 1986.
   Apprensions are considered the best available indicator of the
flow of illegal immigration across the southern border.
   About 12 percent of the decline is due to changes in the
Immigration and Naturalization Service's efforts, another 17 percent
is due to the law's agricultural legalization program, and the
remaining 71 percent is due to the ``deterrent effect,'' the study
said.
   In addition to the sanctions, the law's major features include
legalization programs for which more than 3 million undocumented
immigrants applied, and stepped up enforcement at the southern
border.
   INS spokesman Verne Jervis said the study ``supports our
contention that IRCA is effective in reducing the flow of illegal
aliens across the southern border. We think sanctions are a major
factor in the sharp decline in apprehensions and illegal border
crossings.''
   But Rep. Albert Bustamante, a Texas Democrat whose district
includes a stretch of border from Laredo to Del Rio, said he does
not believe the flow of illegal immigration is down.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney praised South
Korea's decision to purchase U.S. fighter jets on Wednesday, but
indicated the sensitive topic of co-production of the sophisticated
fighters hasn't been resolved.
   Cheney met with reporters after completing the annual series of
talks with his South Korean counterpart, Lee Sang Hoon.
   ``I would like to get the best deal that we can,'' Cheney said,
when asked about the issue.
   The subject of co-production, still eagerly sought by the South
Koreans, has raised concern among some lawmakers on Capitol Hill who
are worried about the transfer of sensitive technology with a nation
eager to build its own aviation industry.
   Lee told reporters South Korea intends to purchase U.S. fighters,
but had not yet decided which type.
   Asked about a possible co-production plan, Cheney said he had
advised his counterpart to purchase U.S. produced fighters.
   He added, however, that it is in the U.S. interest to see that
the Republic of Korea has necessary equipment to upgrade its air
defenses and that the two sides ``have been discussing the best
method'' by which that can be accomplished.
   Cheney said the two sides ``have been exploring other
possiblities and other options'' and that no final decision has been
made.
   ``What is likely to result will probably be some blend,'' Cheney
said, adding that he was pleased the Koreans had decided to purchase
U.S. planes over those of other nations.
   The U.S. secretary also reassured his South Korean counterpart
that the United States has no immediate plans to cut U.S. troop
strength on the Korean peninsula.
   Lee and the U.S. secretary said their talks had been fruitful,
and they issued a joint statement in which both sides pledged ``to
maintain the close and longstanding security relationship'' between
the two countries.
   The South Koreans have expressed interest in either the F-16,
made by General Dynamics Corp., or the F-18, made by McDonnell
Douglas Corp.
   The South Koreans reportedly seek to buy a dozen of the planes,
assemble three dozen more from U.S.-supplied kits and then build
about 72 on their own.
   Sens. John Heinz, R-Pa., and Alan Dixon, D-Ill., have called the
proposed deal a threat, contending it would transfer critical U.S.
technology to a nation that will use it to develop its own aviation
industry to compete with U.S. firms.
   Lawmakers made the same argument last month as they approved a
plan to co-produce the FSX fighter with Japan but placed
restrictions on negotiations for further stages in the project.
President Bush has threatened to veto the resolution.
   Cheney has come under pressure from some members of Congress to
slash U.S. troop strength in South Korea, given that nation's
prosperous economic condition.
   The secretary has refused to make any changes in the U.S.
position this budget year, but has not ruled out looking at such a
proposal in the future.
   The United States spends $2.6 billion a year on troops in South
Korea.
   Cheney assured his Korean counterpart ``that U.S. troops will
remain in Korea as long as they are needed to meet the threat and as
long as the government and the peoples of the Republic of Korea want
them there.''
   In response to the congressional demands, Pentagon officials have
begun to consider possible plans for a reduction in about 43,000
U.S. troops on the Korean peninsula, but the proposals are only in
preliminary stages, officials have said.

<HEAD>Cabinet Proposes Outlawing Surrogate Motherhood, Genetic Engineering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday proposed
legislation that would outlaw surrogate motherhood and genetic
engineering and impose restrictions on artificial insemination of
lesbians and single women.
   West Germany has strict limits on abortion that are being
challenged by the increasingly left-leaning populace.
   Justice Minister Hans Engelhard, who introduced the Embryo
Protection Law at Wednesday's Cabinet session, told reporters it
aims to prevent ``the misuse of modern technology, in particular
human engineering.''
   Engelhard said the Embryo Protection Law would make West Germany
the first nation to forbid alteration of the human embryo.
   ``Not everything that is technically feasible should in fact come
to pass,'' he said.
   Nazi-era attempts at human engineering left an indelible imprint
on many Germans, who remain strongly opposed to scientific
manipulation in reproduction.
   Engelhard called the practice of human engineering, or scientific
selection of sex, physical features and other manipulations of the
embryo ``a nightmare.''
   While some scientific interference in embryo development could be
beneficial, ``man should not be the last victim of modern
technology,'' the minister stated.
   Referring to surrogate motherhood, Engelhard said the concept of
intentionally producing children for rearing by others contradicts
the 1949 Basic Law governing West German society.
   The bill also seeks to prohibit use of public funds for
artificial insemination of single women or homosexuals, which would
likely force any seeking to bear a child to turn abroad for
assistance.
   The bill as approved by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's three-party
coalition was scaled back from a more restrictive proposal by the
conservative Christian Social Union, which sought a ban on
artificial insemination except between married heterosexuals.
   Engelhard, a member of the liberal Free Democratic Party but a
conservative on reproductive issues, said the law was expected to
win parliamentary endorsement.
   The opposition Social Democratic Party and the far-left Greens
said the proposal was inadequate.
   Renate Schmidt of the Social Democrats complained that it focused
on limiting reproductive assistance to heterosexuals ``while leaving
the door wide open'' to other forms of population manipulation.
   She pointed out that nothing under the proposed bill would deter
people from selecting sperm donors on the basis of desirable
physical attributes like skin, eye and hair color.
   Greens parliamentarian Marie-Luise Schmidt described the proposal
as ``piecemeal'' and said her party stood for full renunciation of
reproductive technology and embryo research.

<TEXT>
   A former top aide to several U.S. senators
admitted Wednesday that he sexually assaulted a young female
co-worker last year and agreed to enter a therapy program.
   Quentin C. Crommelin Jr., 44, a native of Wetumpka, Ala., whose
last government job was as Republican counsel for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, pleaded guilty in Arlington County Circuit
Court to a charge of aggravated sexual battery.
   Judge William L. Winston, who accepted the plea agreement
Crommelin's lawyers negotiated with Virginia prosecutors, sentenced
Crommelin to 10 years in prison, suspended the sentence and placed
him on probation for five years with therapy as a special condition
of probation.
   The victim of Crommelin's attack was in the courtroom. ``I'm
happy this is over with,'' she said later, adding that she was
consulted by prosecutors during negotiations on the plea agreement.
She declined, however, to comment on the sentence.
   Prosecutor Barry Heitin said the state was prepared to prove that
the victim met Crommelin when she came to work for him last year as
a 20-year-old intern for the Senate committee.
   On Oct. 30, 1988, Heitin said, Crommelin took her to his
Arlington apartment after a luncheon date and had sexual contact
with her by ``force, threat or intimidation.'' She escaped through a
window and called police.
   Crommelin was a top aide to then-Sen. John East, R-N.C., in 1983
when allegations of sexual misconduct were made against him. He
resigned from East's staff following an investigation by District of
Columbia authorities, but was never charged with a crime.
   Crommelin was appointed Republican counsel for the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee in 1987 by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., serving
until June 1988. He also had worked previously as an aide to Sen.
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., former Sen. James Allen, D-Ala., and former
Sen. Harry Byrd, an independent from Virginia.

<HEAD>Union Launching AIDS Education Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Federation of Teachers on
Wednesday named 11 cities in which the union will help teachers and
school districts develop policies on AIDS education and related
issues.
   Under the five-year, $1 million program, funded by a grant from
the Centers for Disease Control, the union will provide technical
assistance tailored to the needs of locals in the pilot cities.
   Among the most pressing needs, according to a survey of AFT union
leaders, is for information on where to get AIDS education materials
and which ones are appropriate for which age groups.
   The survey found that 72 percent of respondents said there is a
great need to focus on age-appropriate educational materials; 71
percent requested information on books, pamphlets and articles; and
62 percent sought information about model AIDS education efforts.
   Other concerns uncovered in the survey were what kinds of
attendance policies are appropriate for students who have AIDS;
where to obtain factual data on techniques to prevent infection; and
confidentiality questions such as who needs to know if a student or
school employee has AIDS.
   Lou Nayman, director of the union's AIDS project, said
controversies over attendance and AIDS education have torn
communities apart and resulted in negative publicity.
   ``We hope to avoid some of that by getting involved very early on
with key decisionmakers,'' he said. ``The purpose of this program is
to prevent fights, not to start any. ... We are not going into a
locality saying, `We at the top have decided this is what you need
to do.'''
   Nayman said teachers, administrators, board of education
officials, community groups and health authorities would be involved
in various local projects. He said they might include a critical
review of AIDS instructional materials, in-service teacher training,
school policy development and seminars on the legal issues
surrounding AIDS.
   The sites selected by AFT are New York; Baltimore; Washington;
New Orleans; Chicago; Cincinnati; Denver; San Francisco; Portland,
Ore.; Corpus Christi, Texas, and Oklahoma City.
   Another program will affect the Indiana State Employees
Association, an AFT affiliate.
   AFT is an international union representing some 700,000 teachers,
paraprofessionals, school employees, nurses, health care workers and
state employees.

<HEAD>Mitchell Accuses Helms of Stalling Action on State Department Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a tart exchange that tested the limits of
senatorial courtesy, Democratic leader George Mitchell accused
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms on Wednesday of trying to stall
consideration of a $4.6 billion State Department authorization bill.
   Mitchell was trying to get the Senate moving on more than a
hundred amendments to the bill when Helms, the floor manager of the
bill, stood up to ask for additional time for more to be submitted.
   Helms at first protested that Mitchell was trying to curb the
amount of time being given to debate on the bill. But when the Maine
Democrat said the North Carolina Republican had read him wrong,
Helms amended his complaint to say he was worried about Mitchell
seeking to limit amendments.
   Helms, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, long has been known for exploiting the Senate
rules to promote his conservative foreign policy aims, including
delaying tactics and the adroit use of amendments.
   Mitchell said: ``I don't want to delay this bill any further.
This is already in the fourth day. ...''
   Helms: ``Well, Mr. Majority Leader, I say this as your friend and
one who wants to cooperate with you, but don't ignore the fact that
it was you who scheduled the first day of consideration of this bill
on a Friday ... and it was you who declared that there would be no
vote ... telling senators, `Go, go, bye, bye, stay home!' ''
   Mitchell: ``There's no reason why senators can't be present to
submit amendments if they're serious about doing so.''
   Helms: ``Does the majority leader give any assurance ... that no
attempt will be made to add the foreign aid bill to this
authorization bill for the State Department. Does the majority
leader contemplate linking them together and making them one bill?
   Mitchell: ``No, I do not.''
   Helms: ``I can be assured that that's not going to happen?''
   Mitchell: ``If I can get cooperation to get this bill passed, the
president's bill, then I will be pleased to discuss that with the
senator. But what the senator is asking is that he have unlimited
right to delay this legislation for as long as he wants ... and also
extract from me a commitment that I will not present another bill
that he doesn't want. In others, heads, the senator wins, tails, I
lose. That's what the senator is suggesting.''
   Helms: ``Sounds like a good proposition to me. ... I regret that
he has implied that I am delaying this bill. I don't think the
senator could document that. It's not so.''
   Mitchell: ``The senator is the (Republican) manager of the bill.
I announced last night that we were going to go to this bill at 9:15
this morning.''
   Helms: ``Right.''
   Mitchell: ``Managers of the bill have the responsibility in the
Senate to be present when the bill is to be presented. We had a
30-minute delay this morning ... because the senator didn't show up
on time.''
   Helms: ``You told me last night you were going to have a morning
(other business) period.''
   Mitchell: ``I specifically announced it. ...
   ``This is the president's bill. This is the administration's
bill. I'm doing my best to accommodate the president. And what I
find over and over and over again is that I am struggling to advance
the president's interests, when members of the president's party are
opposing the president's interests.''

   Supporters of Salman Rushdie said Wednesday that
the author, who is under an Iranian death threat for writing a novel
many Moslems consider blasphemous, believes reconciliation with his
opponents is possible.
   The Indian-born British novelist, author of ``The Satanic
Verses,'' said many Moslems had written him letters of support since
he was forced into hiding in February, said the International
Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdie and His Publishers.
   Before he died last month, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
called on Moslems to kill Rushdie, whose novel was first published
in English last year. Two Iranian clerics supported the edict by
offering a $5.2 million bounty.
   Angry Moslems have demonstrated against the book in many cities
around the world, including several in England.
   The defense committee, set up to organize protests by free-speech
groups, said it collected signatures on a petition of support from
2,500 writers and about 10,000 readers in 67 countries.
   The names were listed in an 82-page booklet which called on Iran
to lift the death threat against Rushdie.
   The committee's chairman, Kevin Boyle, told a news conference
that Rushdie said in a telephone call that it was assumed there was
``an unbridgeable gap between his version of Islam'' and that of
Moslems who accuse him of blaspheming Islam.
   According to Boyle, Rushdie said the declarations of support
emphasized ``that in fact there is no such unbridgeable gulf, that
he does write from the Islamic tradition.''
   ``It is his hope that the recognition by those who have written
to him and those who have signed this (petition) ... will be part of
a process of mutual understanding within Islam leading to
reconciliation,'' Boyle said.
   In Belgium, the French version of ``The Satanic Verses'' went on
sale Wednesday, and news reports said the few copies available were
quickly sold.
   In Brussels, most bookstores put the novel on sale on their back
shelves, and others did not sell it.
   The novel includes a scene in which prostitutes take the name of
the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed wrote the
holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.

<TEXT>
   A leftist opposition party announced Wednesday
a weeklong campaign of demonstrations and rallies in several cities
to protest alleged fraud in Michoacan state legislative elections.
   In paid advertisements in Mexico City newspapers, the Democratic
Revolutionary Party said it ``demands respect for the will of the
people and that our victories be recognized ... the victories of the
people of Michoacan.''
   A state election board ruled Tuesday night that the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party won 12 of the 24 seats in the new
Michoacan legislature and the Democratic Revolutionary Party six,
with the rest going to three other minority groups.
   Supporters of the Democratic Revolutionary Party, claiming it had
been cheated out of nine seats, blocked roads in Michoacan for a
week to protest the alleged fraud.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo threatened to take
legal action after a man who suffered a heart attack was allegedly
held up at a Michoacan roablock for three hours and died.
   The roadblocks were lifted Wednesday before the attorney general
spoke, Democratic Revolutionary Party officials said, but groups of
opposition supporters remained outside the governor's mansion in
Morelia, the state capital about 150 miles west of Mexico City.
   The July 2 elections in Michoacan and four other states were
widely seen as a test of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's
intentions to clean up Mexico's fraud-ridden balloting system, which
has kept the Institutional Revolutionary Party in power 60 years.
   Salinas' own election in July 1988 was marred by opposition
accusations of irregularities.
   The conservative National Action Party carried Baja California,
with its candidate Ernesto Ruffo becoming the first to defeat the
governing party in a governor's race.
   The Institutional Revolutionary Party won state elections in
Chihuahua and in its strongholds of Zacatecas and Campeche, but the
elections in Michoacan are still in dispute.
   Democratic Revolutionary leaders said in Wednesday's
advertisements that ``the PRI and the government machinery have
indulged in election fraud on a large scale'' and accused them of
altering voter registration rolls, stealing ballot boxes, and
closing polling stations.

   At least 1,360 people have died in flooding in
China since the beginning of June, but an official said the disaster
still could get worse.
   Yang Zhenhuai, deputy director of the State Flood Control
Headquarters and minister of Water Resources, said the worst of the
flooding could occur in the next three weeks.
   The official Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday quoted Yang as saying
about 2,700 people die in floods each year.
   Sichuan, China's most populous province, has suffered the most
this year. More than 800 people have been killed and 5,500 wounded
in flooding across 53 counties. Yang said 221 of the dead were
buried in eight feet of mud and rock when a cliff collapsed.
   He said flooding has been more serious than usual along the
Yangtze River, which flows through Sichuan province, the Huaihe
River and the upper reaches of the Yellow River.
   The news agency said 13 provinces have been hit by serious
flooding that inundated 3.7 million acres of arable land and
destroyed 370,000 homes. In Sichuan alone, 715,000 tons of grain was
lost.
   State TV has shown footage for the past several weeks of severe
flooding throughout south and southwestern China. Shots of people
stranded on rooftops and second-floor balconies, floodwaters nearly
touching the arches of bridges, and swirling river waters are
commonplace.

   Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo said Wednesday
that people should stop discussing whether Vice President Dan Quayle
is ``a dummy'' and worry about more important issues.
   ``They call Quayle a dummy, so what?'' said Cuomo when asked
about a new book that quotes former Quayle campaign advisers saying
unflattering things about the Republican vice president. ``If you've
got nothing else to do next Sunday at 4 o'clock, spend five minutes
reading about Quayle.''
   ``He's the vice president. What are you going to do about it,
impeach him for incompetence?'' said Cuomo during an interview with
Albany radio station WAMC. ``He's the vice president _ move on. He
won't be as bad as others we've had. Let's be candid _ what have we
had, all geniuses?''
   Cuomo was being questioned on WAMC's weekly ``Capitol
Connection'' show about the ongoing HUD housing scandal and calls
for an ethics investigation of New York Republican Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato.
   ``HUD, the accusation against D'Amato, people say Quayle's a
dummy. Let me respond to all of them this way: Who cares?'' said
Cuomo. ``Especially since there are so many more important things.''
   Cuomo said Americans should be more concerned about drugs, health
care and the homeless.
   The new book, ``Whose Broad Stripes and Bright Stars? The Trivial
Pursuit of the Presidency 1988,'' by political columnists Jules
Witcover and Jack Germond, is to be published in several weeks.

<TEXT>
   The nations of southern Africa are
discussing ending the isolation of white-ruled South Africa if it
makes sufficient social and political reform, President Joaquim
Chissano said Wednesday.
   Chissano made the comments after a three-hour meeting with South
African's next president, F.W. de Klerk.
   The president of Mozambique expressed optimism about de Klerk's
commitment to end apartheid quickly after taking power.
   De Klerk says he plans to negotiate a constitution providing a
national vote for South Africa's black majority within five years.
   ``I was pleased to hear that the commitment is to work to achieve
this goal as quickly as possible,'' Chissano said. ``Especially,
there is a commitment that during the mandate of the future
president this problem of discrimination should be solved so that
there will be real democracy in South Africa.
   ``All the countries in southern Africa are discussing together,
and if there is a sound process of change in South Africa, I think
that South Africa will be part of that group of countries,'' he said.
   De Klerk's proposals have won approval from European leaders and
prompted the United States to invite a South African leader to visit
Washington for the first time in more than 30 years.
   However, Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said
Wednesday that de Klerk turned down the invitation to meet with
Secretary of State James Baker after American congressmen opposed
such a meeting.
   In another sign of change in South Africa this month, retiring
P.W. Botha of South Africa met for the first time with imprisoned
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The African National Congress is the leading group fighting
apartheid. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially
segregated society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda, one of South
Africa's staunchest foes, told a news conference he had invited de
Klerk to meet with him. No date has been set.
   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe, who had ruled out meeting
South African leaders until they spoke to Mandela, said Monday he
would consider meeting de Klerk or Botha if the African National
Congress agreed.
   Chissano broke the ice by meeting in September with Botha.
   The two neighbors' relations have steadily improved since then.
South Africa has encouraged its businessmen to invest in Mozambique,

<HEAD>Senate Refuses to Put Limit on Number of Political Ambassadors</HEAD>

   The Senate rejected a resolution Wednesday
seeking to limit the number of political appointees President Bush
could send as ambassadors to the nation's embassies.
   The vote rejecting the Senate resolution was 61 to 38. It would
have set the limit to 30 percent.
   The vote came after Democratic members of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee voiced complaints that up to two thirds of the
ambassadorial appointments made in the first six months of the Bush
administration have been political supporters of the president, not
professional diplomats.
   That percentage, if continued, would reverse the typical average
in the last several presidential administrations, senators said..
   The amendment, offered by Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., to a pending
bill authorizing $4.6 billion in spending for the State Department
and allied agencies, represented a fallback position.
   The Senate on Tuesday soundly defeated, 79-20, his attempt to
impose a mandatory 15 percent ceiling on the number of political
nominations to diplomatic posts.
   Gore said many of his colleagues had found that too severe.
   But he said the situation needs to be addressed.
   ``All of us in both parties are really uneasy and embarrassed,''
Gore said.
   ``It is not just a question of the occasional candidate whose
credentials are grossly inadequate,'' he said. ``It is our
realization that the well being of our country really does depend
more on the astuteness of our diplomats than at any time since the
very earliest days of the Republic.
   Earlier, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee examined the
qualifications of a number of ambassadorial candidates, including
wealthy Republican contributor Joseph B. Gildenhorn and former child
actress and ambassador Shirley Temple Black.
   Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real estate investor with
banking interests, has been nominated to be U.S. ambassador to
Switzerland. From 1984 to early this year, he and members of his
immediate family contributed nearly $230,000 to Republican campaigns
and causes.
   The nominee told the committee that he believed the American
Academy of Diplomacy, an organization composed of 100 distinguished
former diplomats, including all former secretaries of state, treated
him unfairly when it rated him as ``unqualified'' for the job.
   ``I consider myself qualified in all of my endeavors,''
Gildenhorn said, ticking off a series of accomplishments, including
his graduation with honors from the Yale University Law School.
   ``I'm proud of my accomplishments and I'm pleased that I have
achieved financial success over the years,'' Gildenhorn said. ``I'm
honored that the president thinks I'm qualified ... I feel confident
that I am ready to do an able and competent job as ambassador to
Switezerland.''
   Sen. Joesh R. Biden Jr, D-Del., told Gildenhorn that there is
rising concern about the number of major GOP fundraisers and
contributors being named ambassadors.
   Given Bush's background as a diplomat with service as U.S. envoy
to China and United Nations ambassador, ``it has come as somewhat of
a surprise,'' Biden said.
   Under questioning, Gildenhorn said he plans to study French, one
of the major languages of Switzerland, depending on ``what my time
schedule is.''
   But he said that while he does not now speak French, or German or
Italian, ``I would not be adversely effected because English is used
universally.''
   Mrs. Black previously served as U.S. ambassador to Ghana and has
held a large number of positions, including posts at the United
Nations.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., told her that in contrast to some of
the Bush nominees, she has established a substantial and impressive
record and is qualified for the position to which she has been named.
   Even in 1974 when she was first nominated as an ambassador,
Sarbanes said, ``I thought you brought a record of consequence and
had demonstrated that you were a serious person.''

   Pilot Thomas Root's head turned toward
military chase planes during the time he claimed he was unconscious
and his small plane flew 800 miles on autopilot, an investigator
said Wednesday.
   Authorities also ruled out carbon monoxide poisoning, based on a
blood test, as an explanation for his claimed loss of consciousness.
Results of drug and alcohol tests are expected later this week.
   Root continued to stick to his story, that he passed out during a
routine business trip after putting his single-engine Cessna on
autopilot. He said he revived when the plane ran out of gas and
ditched in the sea near the Bahamas, where he was rescued. Doctors
later found he had been shot in the abdomen.
   Andrew Alston, an air safety investigator with the National
Transportation Safety Board, interviewed the 36-year-old Washington
communications attorney again Wednesday at Hollywood's Memorial
Hospital, where he remains in stable condition.
   Alston, who first interviewed Root on Saturday, two days after
his crash and rescue, said at a news conference that he confronted
Root with inconsistencies in his story, but Root had nothing
substantially different to say in response.
   Root's family didn't respond to Associated Press requests for
interviews.
   Alston said inconsistencies include Root's failure to remember
the gunshot, the movement of his head toward military planes sent to
intercept and follow him, and movement of his windshield sun visor.
   ``Various pilots reported that as he was intercepted from the
right his head would turn to the right and as he was intercepted
from the left, his head would move to the left,'' Alston said. ``The
sun visor moved position at least three times during the flight.''
   He declined to interpret the inconsistencies.
   ``He was there. You weren't. I wasn't,'' said Alston.
   He said Root remained calm and collected during their interview.
   Alston wouldn't say if Root could face charges for misleading
investigators.
   FBI spokesman Paul Miller said that agency's investigation is
continuing.
   ``We anticipate that once all our facts are developed, we will
again discuss the matter with the U.S. Attorney's office in Miami,''
Miller said.
   He said one statute being considered in the investigation
concerns destruction of aircraft and motor vehicles.
   Published reports say Root was under watch for possible drug
links and questionable flights.
   Root's plane sank in water about a mile deep. Miller said a
decision on whether the plane should be raised for evidence probably
would be made in Washington.
   Root has insisted his .32-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson revolver must
have fired when his Cessna hit the water. Dick Bachmann, vice
president of Smith &amp; Wesson, said the gun's safety features make
such accidental firings impossible.
   And Hollywood Police Chief Richard Witt told the AP there was
proof that Root's bullet wound was at least four hours old when he
arrived at the hospital.
   Witt's statement supported the findings of Coast Guard surgeon
James Rahman, who has said that peritonitis _ inflammation of lining
of the abdominal cavity _ showed Root must have been shot at least
two hours before he was rescued. Root was picked up almost
immediately after his plane went down.
   In other developments, reports surfaced that, two days before
Root's flight, a federal task force began investigating him on
suspicion of running guns and drugs.
   The investigation was prompted by discovery of 35 guns and five
gallons of ether, a chemical that can be used to process cocaine,
during an April 24 search of Root's airplane hangar at Manassas,
Va., said Emile Manara, an agent working for the task force.
   Root's family has said Root collected guns but moved them out of
his home to keep them away from small children, and that the ether,
a powerful solvent, was intended for cleaning the plane.
   The hangar search also turned up chemical lighting sticks, which
smugglers often attach to drug loads tossed out of airplanes, said
Bill Kelmartin, a Prince William County, Va., police investigator
assigned to the task force.
   Kelmartin said Root claimed he kept the sticks in the airplane
for light in case of an electrical problem.
   A lawsuit filed July 3 in federal court in Macon, Ga., accused
Root of legal malpractice, breach of contract and fraud in handling
a $75,000 transaction for a client.

<HEAD>Treasury Urges Debt Limit Increase Before Congress Recesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department pleaded with Congress
on Wednesday to raise the national debt ceiling and announced its
first step to avoid exceeding the limit if Congress fails to act
before its August recess.
   ``Our immediate need is for legislation to increase the debt
limit,'' Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber told a Senate
Finance subcommittee. Without the extension, he said, the government
would have problems issuing payroll and Social Security checks.
   Glauber echoed Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who wrote
Senate leaders last month urging an increase of the debt ceiling by
$300 billion from the current limit of $2.8 trillion. The House has
passed similar legislation.
   Meanwhile, in its first action to insure that the debt limit is
not exceeded, the department announced it is suspending until
further notice the sale of special securities for state and local
governments.
   The government has been forced to suspend such sales at other
times when Congress was unable to agree on legislation raising the
national debt limit.
   State and local governments buy the special Treasury securities
as a temporary investment vehicle for money they raise in the bond
market.
   If the securities are not available for purchase, state and local
governments could be forced to cancel planned bond sales, leading to
turmoil in the municipal bond market.
   Glauber warned the Finance subcommittee of other effects of
congressional inaction on the debt limit increase.
   ``Without an increase in the debt limit by Aug. 1, full
investment of the Social Security trust funds may not be possible,''
he said.
   The law requires the treasury secretary to invest trust fund
assests in interest-bearing government securities. The securities
are a form of government debt and are counted with other government
bonds and notes against the debt limit.
   While Congress normally appropriates the money to cover any
interest lost to the trust funds during a period when they cannot be
invested, this action has been criticized by groups representing the
elderly.
   Glauber also said that, if Congress did not take action before
its month-long recess beginning Aug. 5, the Treasury would not be
able to make the government payroll for September.
   This would include writing payroll and pension checks exceeding
$23 billion.
   Glauber also proposed changing the method of measuring debt on
government securities from the current ``face amount'' to one based
on the actual value of the security at a particular time.
   For instance, some Treasury securities worth $10,000 are sold at
a discount, accruing interest over time until they are worth their
face value at maturity.

<HEAD>Dalilia Weakens to Tropical Storm; Still Heading Toward Hawaii</HEAD>

   Hurricane Dalilia weakened to a powerful tropical
storm Wednesday and continued on a track that would take it just
south of Hawaii, forecasters said.
   Hawaii Island residents were stocking up on batteries, canned
goods and other emergency supplies as the storm approached from the
southeast.
   Dalilia surprised forecasters Tuesday by turning to the north,
putting it on track to pass 70 miles south of Hawaii Island,
southernmost in the chain, late Wednesday.
   A tropical storm watch _ meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain
were possible _ remained in effect for Hawaii Island.
   At 8 a.m. HST Wednesday, the hurricane was about 230 miles
southeast of Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving west-northwest at about
13 mph, the National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustained
wind speed was 70 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that
speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 85 mph.
   Clarence Lee, head of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, said
Dalilia was expected to weaken but remain a tropical storm for a few
days.
   In Naalehu, the southernmost community in the United States, many
residents were buying emergency supplies.
   ``They've been buying lots of batteries and canned goods _
candles and lamps too,'' said Janice Javar, a cashier at Naalehu
Food Center. ``Almost everyone mentions the hurricane.''
   Naalehu, with about 5,000 residents, is the closest community to
Hawaii Island's south tip.
   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed for the second day as surf
surged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.
   Civil Defense officials closed several seldom-used roads along
Hawaii Island's south shore.
   ``The purpose is to keep campers out so when the storm hits we
don't have to go in and rescue them,'' said Neil Gyotoku, a
spokesman for Hawaii County Civil Defense.
   There were no immediate plans for evacuation, he said.
   Although there were reports of waves washing up on coastal roads,
Hilo police said no injuries or damage were reported as of late
Tuesday.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over of Kauai with wind up to
117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.

   The spokesman, Fred Farrar, said the plane experienced ``complete

   He said information on the crash was ``very, very preliminary''
and there was no word on the number of passengers on board.
   The plane was on a flight from Denver, with an eventual
destination of Chicago.
   A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said authorities
were trying to get information about the crash which occurred just

<HEAD>Relatives of Ex-Officer Detained in US Stage Sit-In at Consulate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Police dispersed relatives and
friends of an expelled army commander when the protesters staged a
sit-in Wednesday before the U.S. Consulate to protest the
ex-officer's detention in New York.
   The protest was in support of former Presidential Guard commander
Col. Philippe Biamby, one of three officers expelled in April after
attempting a coup.
   Dressed in white and clutching a Bible, Biamby's mother, Ketly
Biamby, 69, sat in a wicker chair on the sidewalk facing the
consulate when 25 armed police appeared and ordered her and four
other relatives and friends to leave.
   Police, who said the group had not obtained a permit for the
sit-in, chased away onlookers and journalists.
   U.S. Embassy Spokeswoman Susan Clyde said the embassy asked for
``police protection, not knowing what sort of demonstration the
sit-in could develop into.''
   Mrs. Biamby began a hunger strike Monday to protest the detention
by U.S. Immigration authorities of her son and two other former
Haitian officers, Lt. Col. Leonce Qualo and Col. Himmler Rebu.
   The three, hospitalized in a medical unit of the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in Manhattan, have been on a hunger strike since
June 26.
   ``I will go all the way, and die with them if necessary,'' Mrs.
Biamby said in front of the consulate in downtown Port-au-Prince.
``Will they (U.S. authorities) let us die?''
   Charles Troy, U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Spokesman in
New York, confirmed Tuesday the three are on a hunger strike. He
said they are free to take back their passports and leave if they
withdraw their request for political asylum.
   The three were expelled from Haiti to the neighboring Dominican
Republic on April 3 after troops loyal to Haitian ruler Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril foiled their attempted coup the day before.
   They flew to Miami two days later and asked for political asylum.
They have remained jailed in the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service detention facility in New York pending review of their
request.
   Their detention has stirred controversy in Haiti. Independent
Radio Metropole broadcasts a daily countdown of the number of days
the three have been jailed.
   ``They are victims of an INS policy of racial discrimination''
Jacques Biamby, Philippe Biamby's brother, said as police ordered
him away from the Consulate.
   Avril, U.S. and other Western diplomats said the coup attempt and
a rebellion the following week by two units, also crushed by
loyalist soldiers, were financed by supporters of former dictator
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, who fled into exile in France in
1986.
   Philippe Biamby's father, Pierre Biamby, served as interior
minister and close adviser to Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier, who
ruled from 1957 until his death in office in 1971.
   Pierre Biamby was linked to the 1964 massacre by Duvalierist
thugs of more than 20 mostly wealthy men, women and children in
Jeremie, on Haiti's southwestern tip.
   During the April coup attempt the three ringleaders briefly held
hostage several of Avril's relatives, including his children, wife,
80-year-old mother-in-law and an American houseguest.

   If President Bush, in his Apollo anniversary
speech on Thursday, hands NASA the job of sending Americans back to
the moon and on to Mars, Congress will first have to provide the
billions to rebuild a much-weakened space agency.
   ``Today's NASA can't do it,'' said the agency's administrator,
Richard Truly, last week.
   Since the heyday of Apollo, which put 12 Americans on the moon in
the late 1960s and the early 1970s, NASA's work force has shrunk by
14,000 from 36,000. The managers of Apollo are retiring or have
gone; in recent months many of the top officials have resigned.
   The space agency's contractor force, which builds the
sophisticated equipment needed for such a venture, also is down from
a peak of 400,000 in the Apollo days to slightly more than 100,000
today.
   For any of the goals the president is likely to set, a space
station is a bottom line necessity and there has been considerable
opposition in Congress for spending the $30 billion that alone will
require.
   During Apollo the nation spent between 4 percent and 5 percent of
its federal budget on space. Bush has asked Congress for $13.3
billion next year _ about 1 percent of the $1.16 trillion for 1990.
   ``To do these kinds of programs, the NASA budget would have to
increase by a factor of two at the minimum, and possibly a little
higher,'' said Frank Martin, head of the NASA Office of Exploration.
He estimated space spending would quickly climb to $30 billion a
year to land men on Mars in 2020.
   Martin's office outlined four potential manned expeditions late
last year, two of them involving moon bases, one establishing a Mars
outpost and the other a base on the Martian moon Phobos.
   One of the moon bases would not be permanently staffed, serving
chiefly as an astronomy laboratory where telescopes _ free of
Earth's atmosphere _ could study the most distant galaxies and
search for life. The base would be serviced by visiting astronauts
every every three years.
   The second base, on the front side of the moon, would be manned
permanently.
   Many astronaut crews would be required to construct an
Antarctic-type facility, using lunar soil that is rich in metals and
silicon which could be mixed with water to form a kind of cement.
   Oxygen, which can be extracted from rocks on the moon, could be
mixed with hydrogen brought from Earth to provide water and also
supply rocket fuel for Mars or other space expeditions.
   NASA has studied two approaches for exploring Mars: one using
humans, the other a robot capable of moving around the surface. A
combination of those two would place astronauts on Phobos to guide
the rover on Mars.
   ``An expedition to Phobos would establish early leadership by
sending the first human travelers to the Martian moon to explore,
conduct resource surveys and establish a science station,'' said the
exploration office in an annual report.

<HEAD>Pierce to Testify Again in HUD Investigation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Adds 12 grafs of detail</HEAD>

   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce Jr. will
testify at least twice more to a congressional panel investigating
allegations of mismanagement and favoritism in the agency he headed
for eight years, the subcommittee's chairman said Wednesday.
   Pierce's earlier testimony _ that he was not involved in many of
the project-funding decisions at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development _ has been called into question by later witnesses.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said staff members
for the panel met with Pierce Wednesday.
   ``There was no discussion with respect to the substance of his
statements,'' Lantos said. ``That would have been inappropriate.''
   Pierce will testify Aug. 3 before the House Government Operations
subcommittee on housing and employment and will come back at least
once and perhaps twice more after Labor Day, Lantos said.
   At the August hearing, Pierce will be asked about his possible
role in approving funding for a project in Durham, N.C., that
converted a defunct hosiery mill into housing for the elderly.
   HUD staff members recommended strongly that the project should
not receive $15 million in government money, saying the project was
too expensive, was located atop a toxic waste site and was too close
to railroad tracks.
   Last week, Shirley McVay Wiseman, former assistant secretary for
housing at HUD, testified under oath that Pierce himself ordered her
to approve money for the project.
   ``I want the project funded,'' Wiseman quoted Pierce as saying.
   That project was being pushed by a former law partner of Pierce.
   Pierce met Wednesday with Stuart Weisberg, staff counsel for the
subcommittee, who eluded reporters waiting outside his office in
anticipation of the meeting.
   Lantos, who called the meeting private, refused to say how many
other people met with Pierce or whether it was held outside the
Capitol complex.
   ``I will not tell you where it was held,'' Lantos said. ``It was
a relaxed, lengthy, cordial and productive meeting.''
   The subcommittee has been examining allegations of influence
peddling at HUD in which well-connected Republicans obtained scarce
funds to fix up housing projects either they or their clients were
developing. In one case, former Interior Secretary James Watt was
paid more than $300,000 to help a developer obtain funds to fix up a
300-apartment housing project.
   In addition, the subcommittee has investigated HUD's practice of
using private agents to finalize the sale of foreclosed property
owned by the department. In at least a dozen cases, these closing
agents failed to hand over money from the sales to HUD, resulting in
a loss estimated at $20 million.
   Lantos said he expects the hearings to continue through the fall
and will move into other areas of HUD but the panel will not try to
investigate everything about the department.
   ``We're sort of viewing this as a Whitman Sampler (a box of
chocolate candy),'' Lantos said. ``We won't go after each piece of
chocolate.''
   While the inquiry eventually will end, it will not reach a tidy
conclusion, he said.
   ``The HUD crisis is an ocean without a shore,'' Lantos said. ``We
will not reach the shore because there isn't one.''
   A Republican member of the committee said members ``were not
interested in trying to get someone to perjure themselves'' but
needed to hear from Pierce to resolve conflicts between his earlier
testimony and the accounts of subsequent witnessses.
   ``He was very adamant in saying never, that he was never
involved,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``He have a
conflict that we need to resolve. We just really want the truth on
what he did.''

   President Bush said Wednesday he will nominate
former Peace Corps Director Loret M. Ruppe as the new ambassador to
Norway.
   Bush also announced he will nominate former Iowa Republican
chairman Sally J. Novetzke as ambassador to Malta.
   The president also is nominating Miklos Salgo, who has headed
State Department efforts to decide the fate of the bugged,
unoccupied new U.S. Embassy in Moscow, for the rank of ambassador in
his role as special negotiator for property issues.
   Salgo, 74, is a former business executive and U.S. ambassador to
his native Hungary. He recently recommended a plan to try saving
part of the Moscow embassy. Some lawmakers want it torn down and
built anew with American, not Soviet, labor.
   Mrs. Ruppe, 53, served a record eight years as Peace Corps
director until this past May 1, when she was succeeded by Paul D.
Coverdell. She was chairman of Bush's presidential primary campaign
in Michigan and then co-chairman of the state's Reagan-Bush
committee in 1980.

   Soldiers killed two Palestinians in clashes in
the occupied West Bank Wednesday, army and hospital officials said,
and a third was reported slain by Palestinians who accused him of
collaborating with Israel.
   A soldier who suffered injuries in a recent bus crash blamed on a
Palestinian and a 12-year-old boy who fought earlier with soldiers
also died on Wednesday, the army said.
   At least 39 Palestinians were wounded by plastic or lead bullets
in confrontations with Israeli troops, including 23 in the Rafah
refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab hospital reports said.
   Fifteen others from Rafah were treated for minor injuries from
rubber-coated steel pellets used by the army in riot control, they
said. They included a 4-year-old girl hit in the mouth.
   The deaths raised to at least 571 the number of Palestinians
killed since the uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip began Dec. 8, 1987. Thirty-seven Israelis also have died.
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, a hard-liner in Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir's Likud bloc, renewed his criticism of the
government's handling of the uprising.
   ``The time has come to deal with one subject, restoring security
to the daily lives of Jews and to stop talking nonsense,'' Sharon
said.
   Sharon also criticized Shamir and Likud's Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens for their meetings with local Palestinian leaders and
reiterated his opposition to any contact with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   ``The PLO is the main obstacle to peace in the Middle East and
therefore, there should be no talks with it. The PLO pretends to be
speaking in the name of all the Palestinians. We don't accept and
will not accept it,'' he told parliament.
   Samir Akhras, 20, was fatally shot during a predawn army raid on
the village of Beit Lid near Tulkarem, the army said.
   ``One of the forces encountered violent oppositon, and in the
confrontation one youth was shot,'' said an army spokesman,
insisting on anonymity. ``An army doctor tried unsuccessfully to
revive him.''
   Also killed was Khader Jazri, 20, who was shot in a
stone-throwing clash with troops in Jenin, Arab reports said. The
army said it was checking the report.
   A 12-year-old boy from Rafah, Iyad Abdel Fatah Al Badli, died
Wednesday at the Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv, after being
shot in the head in a clash with troops on July 8, the army and Arab
reports said.
   Arab reports said the body of Rizik Abdel Razak Berat, 65, was
found in a well in the West Bank village of Taibe near Ramallah.
They said he had been shot, apparently by an Arab assailant,
allegedly for helping Israeli authorities. The army said it was also
checking this report.
   More than 80 Palestinians suspected of collaborating have been
killed by fellow Arabs since the Palestinian uprising began.
   The latest Israeli fatality of the uprising was 19-year-old Tova
Maimon, a soldier who died Wednesday of injuries suffered July 6 in
a bus crash blamed on a Palestinian.
   The Palestinian, who is in police custody, allegedly grabbed the
wheel of the bus on the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway and steered it
into a 200-foot ravine.
   On Tuesday, Riva Levine, 39, a lawyer from Philadelphia, died of
injuries from the crash, which killed 16 people and injured 25.
   Army radio on Wednesday played a tape of an interview made last
week with Ms. Levine, who said the bus attack had strengthened her
resolve to move to Israel.
   ``Yes, I would like to live here for a while,'' she said. ``If
anything, what happened shows me how important it is for Jewish
people to live in Israel.''
   In the Gaza Strip, soldiers clamped a curfew on the Khan Yunis
refugee camp after nightlong clashes between troops and stone
throwers.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, a military court sentenced two
Palestinians to life in prison and four others to terms of 15 years
for killing a soldier on Feb. 24.
   The soldier, paratrooper Binyamin Meisner, 24, died after
Palestinians dropped a concrete block on him from a rooftop in
Nablus.

   William C. Lucas, nominated as the nation's
chief civil rights enforcer, on Wednesday defended both his
commitment to the drive against discrimination and his actions when
customs inspectors found $8,800 worth of undeclared goods in his
luggage.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, querying Lucas about the 1985
incident with the Customs Service, asked, ``How do you explain
concealing receipts and merchandise from the customs inspectors?''
   Lucas said the violation involved jewelry carried in a cosmetics
case by an unidentified member of his family.
   He said he had not been aware of all the purchases his wife and
daughters had made during their trip to Japan and South Korea. Their
declaration to customs inspectors in Seattle, he said, was for
merchandise worth $4,800.
   Lucas was told by the committee chairman, Sen. Joseph Biden,
D-Del., that his nomination to head the Justice Department's civil
rights division ``has been contentious and will be contested.''
   One Democratic senator said he wanted Lucas called back to answer
other questions but a Republican predicted Lucas would be swiftly
confirmed by the Senate.
   The black former sheriff and county executive fielded repeated
questions about his run-in with customs inspectors.
   Metzenbaum quoted a Customs Service report as saying that the
Lucas family had initially said they had no receipts but that a
search revealed there were receipts. The senator said customs
officials reported Lucas repeatedly told them that the luggage
contained ``sweatshirts.''
   Lucas also told the committee that his family were inexperienced
travelers and had been unclear about how to report the goods.
Metzenbaum said the Customs Service described Lucas as an
experienced traveler.
   Metzenbaum asked why Lucas had failed to disclose on a committee
questionnaire that he had once been investigated for violating
customs regulations for which he was fined. The senator did not say
how much Lucas had been fined for trying to conceal undeclared
merchandise.
   Lucas said there had been no investigation.
   ``You didn't think when they went through your pockets and the
pockets of your family that that wasn't an investigation?''
Metzenbaum asked.
   ``I wasn't searched, nor did I consider that an investigation,''
Lucas responded.
   He was also questioned about his commitment to enforcing civil
rights laws.
   ``If a case is brought to me involving a cross burning on the
lawn of a citizen, believe me, this is not just cold facts to me,''
the 61-year-old former Wayne County, Mich., official told the
committee.
   ``I have been there. I have smelled the smoke. I have smelled the
fear.''
   He did not elaborate.
   Several senators said they were not certain that Lucas was the
right man to champion the civil rights cause.
   Lucas was repeatedly asked his opinions of several Supreme Court
decisions this year that have inflamed the civil rights community.
Its leaders say the rulings will make it increasingly difficult for
minorities to make headway in the areas of job discrimination, sex
bias in the workplace and minority set-asides in public contracts.
   Lucas declined to criticize the court in a number of instances in
which senators gave him an opportunity to do so. Instead, he said he
would monitor the effect of the rulings and promised to push for
legislation if problems arise.
   ``Frankly what I think you are saying is, `We'll make a study of
it and, if it doesn't work out, propose legislation,''' said
Metzenbaum, adding, ``But time has a way of slipping by.''
   Lucas' reception split largely along party lines.
   ``He will be a moderator, a conciliator, a unifier,'' said Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, while Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, described Lucas
as ``a monument to what can be achieved without regard to race or
color.''
   Hatch predicted that Lucas would be confirmed with little delay
and told the nominee:
   ``I happen to believe that you will make one of the greatest
attorneys general of the United States in charge of the civil rights
division or any other division if you were given the chance and the
opportunity.''
   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told lawmakers there were
``a number of serious questions that need to be answered'' and Sen.
Paul Simon, D-Ill., after questioning Lucas, said he still had
doubts about the nominee's commitment.
   After Lucas finished more than three hours of testimony, one
senator said he still had enough questions about the nominee's past
that he wanted Lucas called back to the stand.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., told a reporter, ``There are a lot of
charges against him. We need to get to the bottom of them.''
   Heflin, asked if he wanted to question Lucas further about
misstatements he made on a 1981 application to join the New York
bar, replied:
   ``I ain't got to the bottom of it yet.''
   Lucas' critics hammered at his relative lack of experience within
the civil rights field, but his supporters scoffed at that.
   The Bush administration has acknowledged that Lucas has never
taken part in a trial or handled an appeal but has sought to stress
his talents as a manager. Nevertheless, giggling swept over the
hearing room when, during an exchange with Sen. Arlen Specter,
R-Pa., the nominee declined to argue a legal point, saying, ``I am
new to the law.''
   Lucas received his law degeee in 1962.

   Attackers threw grenades into a crowd
of Sinhalese and Tamil worshipers at a ceremony meant to promote
ethnic peace, killing 13 people and wounding 85, authorities said.
   A police official said three grenades were hurled at the
gathering Tuesday night in Kataragama, a town about 100 miles
southeast of Colombo.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack.
   (United News of India said a Sri Lankan Tamil politician escaped
assassination Wednesday but 13 people were injured when a grenade
thrown at his car missed and struck another vehicle.)
   (Vardaraja Perumal, a moderate Tamil leader and chief minister of
Northeastern Province, was traveling in a motorcade in Jaffna when
the grenade was thrown, the agency said. The report could not be
confirmed in Sri Lanka.)
   About 5,000 people had assembled in Kataragama for a procession
ending a week-long religious festival that attracts both Sinhalese
Buddhists and Tamil Hindus, the police official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The annual ceremony is viewed as a demonstration that Tamils and
majority Sinhalese can live together in peace and harmony. Tamils
are waging war for an independent homeland, prompting a backlash
among Sinhalese militants.
   ``It is a tragedy beyond comparison,'' said Ranjith Madumma
Bandara, a government lawmaker who participated in the procession
from a Hindu temple to a Buddhist shrine.
   ``There is nothing sacred in this country anymore,'' he added.
   Hours after the explosions, the government warned people to be
vigilant in crowded places such as bus and train stations.
   ``The subversives are prepared to place explosives and detonate
them by electrical or other means to cause death and destruction of
innocent civilians,'' it said without identifying the subversives.
   Bandara, a Sinhalese Buddhist, said two women walking beside him
were killed but he escaped injury. Another women and three children
were also killed.
   Among the injure was Dharamadasa Banda, minister of state for
rehabilitation and religious chief for the two shrines, said Bandara.
   (In Madras, India, a Sri Lankan Tamil party blamed the attack on
Sinhalese militants from the left-wing People's Liberation Front.
Ponnudurai Ravinesan, spokesman for the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front, said he had information from Sri Lanka that the
grenades were thrown by radicals of the front.
   (The front has often attacked fellow Sinhalese since it launched
an uprising in 1987 to overthrow President Ranasinghe Premadasa's
government. It accuses the Sinhalese-dominated government of selling
out its own people in efforts to make peace with Tamil rebels.)
   About 14,000 people have been killed on this island nation off
southern India since the strife began. Tamil militants launched
their war for a independent homeland in 1983.
   Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and claim
they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75
percent of the population.
   The government imposed censorship July 6 amid escalating violence
and a political dispute with India over withdrawal its peacekeeping
forces.
   Premadasa has demanded India withdraw its estimated 40,000
soldiers by the end of July. Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
rejected the request, saying a premature pullout would lead to more
bloodshed.
   Indian troops were dispatched to Sri Lanka on July 30, 1987, to
supervise a peace pact designed to give Tamils some autonomy in the
north and the east. The most militant Tamil guerrilla group ignored
the accord and started attacking Indian soldiers, Sri Lankan
security forces and civilians.
   India became involved in its neighbor's problems because of
sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils for the rebel cause.

   Friends and supporters of Rep. Robert Garcia,
D-N.Y., contributed $14,600 last year to a defense fund for the
indicted congressman, who has estimated he'll owe lawyers up to
$200,000 for his Wedtech defense.
   A fund to help pay legal fees was established March 20, 1987,
according to Garcia's financial disclosure form, filed last month
after he received an extension from the clerk of the House. The
forms are due every May 15.
   ``The fund is maintained separately and independently from the
congressman,'' says an addendum to the disclosure form.
``Contributors and contribution amounts are not reported to
Congressman Robert Garcia.'' The total was listed as $14,600.
   Garcia was indicted last November along with his wife, Jane, on
charges that they took bribes from the Wedtech Corp.
   Prosecutors have charged that the former Bronx, N.Y., military
contractor funneled $86,100 through a lawyer in Puerto Rico to Mrs.
Garcia for ``consulting services'' that really amounted to influence
peddling by her husband. Wedtech's founder also allegedly gave Mrs.
Garcia a diamond-and-emerald necklace and a $77,500 check disguised
as an investment. Trial is scheduled for September.
   Garcia has already spent more than $110,000 from his campaign
treasury for legal fees and had only $4,430 left in the account at
the beginning of 1989.
   Garcia's spokesman, Ron Simoncini, said Wednesday he could not
immediately answer questions about the form. But earlier this year,
Garcia told The New York Times his legal fees could reach $200,000.

   A Quebec woman seeking an abortion asked an
appellate court Wednesday to overturn an injunction obtained by her
former boyfriend in the third such case this month in Canada.
   The cases have increased pressure on the government to come up
with a new abortion law. Canada has been without legislation since
early 1988, when the Supreme Court threw out the existing law,
saying the cumbersome procedure required for an abortion infringed
on women's rights.
   The Toronto Star on Wednesday quoted Justice Minister Doug Lewis
as saying the government will tackle the abortion issue this fall
but will not necessarily come up with a new law.
   In Quebec, 21-year-old Chantal Daigle turned to a three-judge
appeals panel after Superior Court Judge Jacques Viens Monday
granted an injunction sought by her former boyfriend, Jean-Guy
Tremblay, 25.
   Ms. Daigle is 20 weeks pregnant. She could seek an abortion
outside of Quebec but could face a two-year prison sentence and a
fine if the injunction stands.
   Last week in Toronto, the Ontario Supreme Court threw out an
injunction that was preventing Barbara Dodd, 22, from having an
abortion.
   She went ahead with the operation immediately, but on Tuesday she
appeared publicly with Greg Murphy, 23, who had sought the
injunction, and she accused abortion rights groups of encouraging
her to have the operation.
   ``I think the fetus should have the right to life,'' said Ms.
Dodd.
   She said pro-choice activists, whom she did not name, ``used me
to promote their cause.''
   ``I was under control by those people,'' Ms. Dodd said as Murphy
sat beside her at the news conference. ``I was never given a moment
to myself to think about what I was doing.''
   Cherie MacDonald, spokeswoman for the Ontario Coalition for
Abortion Clinics, said her organization had not pressured Ms. Dodd
to go through with the procedure.
   ``It's absolutely false,'' she said. ``She is a very confused
young woman.''
   A woman in Winnipeg, Manitoba, went ahead with an abortion
earlier in July after her former boyfriend failed to obtain an
injunction.
   The House of Commons has been reluctant to act on the
controversial issue. The federal government placed six options on
abortion before the House of Commons in July 1988. None received a
majority.
   In a column Wednesday in the Globe and Mail newspaper, lawyer
Jacques J.M. Shore wrote that many Canadians are disappointed and
angered by the federal government's ``continued laissez-faire
attitude'' toward abortion.
   ``It is becoming more obvious each day that Canada cannot remain
unique in the Western world as a nation with no legal boundaries
concerning the willful termination of pregnancy,'' he wrote. ``At
least until a new law is passed, Canadians can expect that
additional names will be added to the growing list of women ... who
are required to battle in court before being allowed to undergo an
abortion.''

<HEAD>Allegations of Sexual Misconduct Latest to Plague Illinois Congressman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like a cat with nine political lives, Rep. Gus
Savage has survived gaffes that might have ended many political
careers.
   He has been slammed by political challengers for absenteeism in
Congress and globe-trotting appearances for questionable causes,
accused by government agencies of failing to disclose sources of
funds and investigated for personnel practices.
   But the latest crisis _ allegations of sexual misconduct raised
by a 28-year-old Peace Corps volunteer _ could be the most
explosive. In an article Wednesday in the Washington Post, the woman
accused the 63-year-old congressman of repeatedly fondling her in
the back of a chauffeur-driven embassy car while he was visiting
Zaire in March.
   Savage frequently counters criticism by labeling it racially
motivated, and none of his past problems have affected his
popularity in the 2nd District, a predominantly black area that
contains some of the nation's most impoverished neighborhoods.
   Last November, he was re-elected with 83 percent of the vote,
having earlier topped a five-way Democratic primary by getting more
votes than his four challengers combined.
   When asked about the alleged sexual misconduct, Savage told a
reporter from the Washington Post: ``I don't want to talk about
that. ... Ask me the same kind of questions you ask white
congressmen.''
   Savage gained prominence in Chicago political circles first as a
civil-rights organizer and later as publisher of a chain of
community newspapers.
   He made unsuccessful tries for the Democratic congressional
nomination in 1968 and 1970, losing to candidates backed by the
powerful Democratic machine controlled by then-Mayor Richard J.
Daley.
   When the white incumbent retired in 1980, voters in the 2nd
District on Chicago's South Side chose Savage over the machine's
hand-picked black candidate.
   The the Chicago Sun-Times found he finished his first year in
office having participated in only 51 percent of the recorded votes
_ the lowest percentage in the House.
   The following January, Savage showed up at a demonstration in
Lisbon, Portugal, leading 50,000 demonstrators against American
policy who were described as mainly Communist trade unionists.
   Savage dismissed his critics, saying at the time: ``I have
different priorities than most politicians. I didn't go to Congress
to get along, or to go along.''
   He defended his absenteeism at another juncture by saying, ``It
is plumb foolish to depend on legislation from a white Congress to
provide for black liberation.''
   The Federal Election Commission filed a civil suit against
Savage's 1982 campaign in 1984, accusing it of failing to report the
source of its money and asking the court to impose a $5,000 fine.
   More recently, Savage came under fire for inflaming racial
passions in Chicago's mayoral elections. During the February
primary, Savage called eventual winner Richard M. Daley, who is
white and a son of the late mayor, a ``born-and-bred racist.''
   When Democratic National Committee Chairman Ron Brown came to the
city to campaign on Daley's behalf, Savage called the black party
leader an ``Oreo'' for supporting Daley over black challenger
Timothy Evans.
   Savage; his son, Thomas John Savage; and Walter Fauntroy, the
District of Columbia's congressional delegate, also are subjects of
a preliminary investigation by the FBI into Fauntroy's employment of
the younger Savage.
   Investigators have said Thomas Savage reported he was living in
Chicago and running for the Illinois Legislature at the same time he
was on Fauntroy's payroll.
   The FBI also is looking into any connection between the younger
Savage's job and his father's employment of a former Fauntroy aide.

   Security forces shot and
killed the brother of rebel leader Francis Ona in jungle fighting on
the strife-torn island of Bougainville, officials said Wednesday.
   Also killed in gun battles Tuesday was another member of the
Bougainville Republican Army, which seeks to secede from Papua New
Guinea.
   The rebels also want the equivalent of $10 billion compensation
for environmental damage caused by the huge Bougainville copper mine.
   The open-cut mine, among the world's 10 largest, provides 45
percent of the country's export income and 17 percent of government
revenue.
   The mine had 3,000 employees until sabotage attacks forced it to
close in May and a state of emergency was declared. At least 23
people, including three soldiers, have been killed in the violence,
which broke out in November.
   Papua New Guinea, an Australian colony until 1975, has a mainly

   Dotaona repeated an appeal to the militants to lay down their
arms, saying further fighting will only cost lives.

   A woman was charged with using arsenic to
kill her first husband and a boyfriend, whose bodies were exhumed
after her current husband fell ill on their honeymoon. Other deaths
are being investigated, officials said.
   Blanche Taylor Moore made her first court appearance Wednesday,
the day after she was arrested, and her lawyer said she is innocent
of all charges.
   ``Mrs. Moore personally, while traumatized and upset over being
arrested and denied bond, is determined to rally and present her
side of all this. ... She maintains her innocence,'' said her
attorney, Mitchell McEntire.
   Mrs. Moore, 56, a small, graying woman wearing orange prison
overalls, appeared before Alamance County Superior Court Judge
Spencer Ennis. He set a probable cause hearing for Aug. 1 and deputy
sheriffs took her back to jail.
   She was arrested Tuesday night at the Alamance County home of her
daughter, Cindy Taylor.
   She was charged with assault with a deadly weapon with intent to
kill in the poisoning of her husband, the Rev. Dwight Moore, 54, who
has been hospitalized since May with what doctors say is arsenic
poisoning.
   Also Tuesday, Burlington police charged her in the 1973 arsenic
poisoning death of her first husband, James N. Taylor. And in
Forsyth County west of here, the sheriff's department issued a
warrant charging Mrs. Moore in the death of Raymond Reid, a
boyfriend who died in 1986.
   Bond was set at $100,000 on a charge of assault against Moore,
but no bond has yet been set on two first-degree murder charges. She
cannot be released until bond is set and posted for those charges.
   Taylor's and Reid's bodies were ordered exhumed after Moore fell
ill, and authorities concluded that their deaths had been caused by
arsenic. On Tuesday, a judge also ordered the exhumation of the body
of Mrs. Moore's father, Parker D. Kiser Sr., to determine whether
his 1966 death was caused by arsenic.
   Reid, the manager of a Kroger grocery store, signed a will a
month before his death bequeathing equal shares of his estate to
Mrs. Moore and his two sons, Steven and Raymond Jr. Mrs. Moore
reported she received more than $22,500 from the estate.
   Taylor, a 45-year-old furniture refinisher, also died of heart
failure caused by arsenic poisoning in October 1973, State Medical
Examiner John Butts said.
   Authorities declined to say how many deaths they are
investigating, but Alamance County Sheriff Richard Frye said his
department has ``a short list'' of other deaths he is investigating.
   Mrs. Moore has so far declined to talk with police, Frye said
Wednesday.
   Moore was taken May 7 to N.C. Memorial Hospital in Chapel Hill
complaining of nausea and vomiting shortly after his April honeymoon
in New Jersey. The arsenic was discovered within a few days after
his admission. Moore remains hospitalized in fair condition.
   Mrs. Moore, a 30-year Kroger employee, filed a $14 million sexual
harassment lawsuit against the grocery chain in January 1986,
alleging a superior, Robert Hutton, harassed her by threatening her
job security. The lawsuit was settled out of court in July 1987, but
the terms were not disclosed.
   In the suit Mrs. Moore said she felt ``completely alienated and
antagonistic toward men and has not been able to maintain any
meaningful social contacts with members of the opposite sex.''

<HEAD>Watkins Urged to Declare Nevada Site Unsuitable for Nuclear Waste</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., urged Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins on Wednesday to scrap plans to build a
high-level nuclear waste dump in Nevada, saying delays ``now made it
certain'' the site would not be ready in time.
   The Energy Department has set a 2003 target date for opening the
underground repository, but a series of technical and political
obstacles have put that target in doubt.
   The dump would hold waste from commercial nuclear plants that
will be dangerously radioactive for at least 10,000 years. It is
about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Nuclear utilities are desperate for a permanent storage facility
because the cost of keeping waste in ``temporary'' storage at
reactor plants is escalating.
   Bryan said Watkins has legal authority to halt the department's
work at Nevada's Yucca Mountain, which so far has been limited to
preparing a means of ``characterizing'' the site, or determining its
geologic suitability as a dump.
   Bryan said in a letter to Watkins that the department should turn
away from the underground storage idea to consider ways of storing
the waste at reactor sites in ``dry casks'' or other methods.
   ``I believe you can restore scientific integrity and rational
public policy to a program that, if continued, is destined to fail
for scientific, economic and political reasons,'' Bryan said in his
letter.
   A Nuclear Regulatory Commission geologist, in a report made
public Tuesday, said preliminary Energy Department analyses of
volcanic potentials near Yucca Mountain had grossly understated the
chances of an eruption.
   The geologist, John Trapp, said the odds of an eruption during
the next 10,000 years may be about one in six, rather than the
one-in-30 chance cited by other scientists.
   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said on the Senate floor Wednesday that
Trapp was a ``hero.''
   ``He did what no one expected him to do: Tell it like it really
is and let the chips fall where they may,'' Reid said, adding that
the proposal for storing nuclear waste at Yucca Mountain was
seriously flawed and an economic disaster.
   ``A nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain would be as
smart as storing nitro-glycerin in a boiling tea pot,'' he said.
   Watkins has said he feels bound by the Nuclear Waste Policy Act
Amendments of 1987 to carry out a suitability study at Yucca
Mountain, even though the state government has gone on record
opposing the project.
   Christina Sankey, a department spokeswoman, said in response to
Bryan's letter that while she was not sure Watkins had seen it, the
plea would not change his mind that it is too early to give up on
Yucca Mountain.
   ``He opposes such a move,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A United Airlines DC-10 carrying 298
people crashed in an explosive ball of fire Wednesday while trying
to make an emergency landing. At least 80 people survived, an
official said.
   Flight 232 from Denver to Chicago carried 287 passengers and 11
crew members, said Deborah Jones, a United spokeswoman.
   The crash, a half-mile from a runway, could be one of the worst
in U.S. history.
   A witness, Mark Smith, said he saw survivors walking away from
the crash.
   ``We could see the plane tumbling down the runway'' after ``a
wing hit the ground,'' said Smith, who said he was working about
1,500 yards from the site.
   He said the plane broke into ``15,000 different pieces'' and the
only intact piece was the nose.
   The plane experienced ``complete hydraulic failure'' before the
crash just after 4 p.m., Federal Aviation Administration spokesman
Fred Farrar said.
   The tail engine failed, and this may have caused a hydraulic
failure, said Bob Raynesford, another FAA spokesman.
   ``This plane went down on approach to the airport. They were
having problems before it went down. So they were prepared at the
scene,'' said police Lt. Gene Erickson.
   Raynesford told CNN that ``there appear now to be 80 survivors.''
   CBS-TV quoted Janet Flanagan of St. Luke's Regional Medical
Center as saying that 26 people walked in, and at least nine were
critically injured.
   Diane Kay, a spokeswoman for the Marion Health Center, said 24
survivors had been brought there.
   ``They're all being treated,'' she said. ``We're seeing burns and
multiple injuries. I don't have a condition report at this time.''
   ``We did hear a jolt. We saw all the smoke,'' said Jean Hopper,
manager of a Motel 6 near the airport. ``The smoke is still rolling
quite heavily from the airport.''
   Witnesses watched as the plane struggled to make it to the
airport.
   ``We watched it circle coming in to the southeast of our plant.
We were optimistic. We thought it was going to make it,'' said Glen
Olson, city editor of the Sioux City Journal. Olson and other
employees watched the airplane circle from the newspaper plant, six
miles away.
   The airport has two active runways, each 9,000 feet long, which
can accommodate a plane the size of a DC-10. The area immediately
around the airport, which is seven miles from downtown, is crop land
in corn, soybeans and pasture with some trees.
   No unusual weather was reported. Wind speeds were clocked up to
30 mph.
   The nation's worst air crash happened 10 years ago and involved a
DC-10.
   On May 25, 1979, American Airlines Flight 191 lost an engine on
takeoff from Chicago's O'Hare Airport, banked sideways out of
control, slammed into a field and exploded. All 258 passengers and
13 crew members died, as well as two people on the ground.
   The National Transportation Safety Board laid primary blame for
the crash on the airline, citing ``maintenance-induced damage'' _ a
10-inch crack in the engine mount _ that caused the left engine to
tear loose. The NTSB also criticized McDonnell Douglas' design as
vulnerable to maintenance damage.
   McDonnell Douglas suspended production of the DC-10 airliner in
1983. DC-10 orders collapsed in 1979 because of the recession and
the May 1979 crash of an American Airlines DC-10 in Chicago that
killed 273 people. Bad passenger reaction to the crash apparently
discouraged airlines from placing orders. In all, 369 DC-10s were
produced, the last one in February 1983.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says ``Very Few'' Chinese Students Arrested</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole said China's ambassador to the
United States told him Wednesday that ``very few'' Chinese students
were arrested in the crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations and
only 10 people have been executed.
   Dole, the Senate GOP leader, said Ambassador Han Xu made the
remarks to him after being handed a protest letter signed by 42
Republican senators.
   The letter predicted ``tremendous'' damage to U.S.-Chinese
relations ``should your government continue on the course of
state-sponsored violence and intimidation on which you are
embarked.''
   ``In his view very few students were arrested and most of those
who are sought were criminals,'' Dole said, reporting on his meeting
with the ambassador.
   ``He said there had been only 10 executions,'' added the senator
from Kansas.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who attended the meeting, said that
the ambassador was told that television and newspaper reporting from
China indicates that hundrds of people have been arrested and many
executed.
   He said the ambassador did not accept that characterization of
the situation.
   Dole said the ambassador also protested arrangements being made
to enable Chinese students and scholars in the United States to
extend their stay in order to avoid persecution in China.
   ``It was his view that most Chinese students would like to stay
in the United States permanently,'' Dole said. ``He said they aren't
in any danger at home and that they are needed at home.''
   The letter noted that Han Xu is concluding his service in the
United States and returning to China.
   ``We want to be certain you take with you no illusion about our
reaction to recent events in China, and our concern about their
impact on U.S.-Chinese relations,'' the letter said.
   ``The American people, and those of us who have been elected to
represent them, are outraged that your government has so brutally
repressed peaceful demonstrations of hundreds of thousands of
Chinese citizens,'' the letter said.
   ``We regard the continued harassment, arrest and even execution
of those deemed responsible for organizing the demonstrations as
gross violations of the rights of your citizenry.''
   Earlier, the Senate adopted a resolution naming the small park
across the street from the Chinese Embassy here Tiananmen Square
Park.
   The sponsor, Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., said the park would
``remind Beijing that America will never and can never forget the
ruthless and callousness of the Chinese government in crushing their
citizen demonstrators and their aspirations.''
   The resolution also expressed the sense of the Senate that a
statue should be erected in the park in plain view of the embassy to
further honor the students who were killed in the square.

<HEAD>Judges Order Louisiana To Dismantle Higher Education System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA ASHTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Louisiana's illegally segregated system of
higher education must be dismantled to achieve a better racial mix
at 17 public colleges and universities, three federal judges ruled
Wednesday.
   Among the changes ordered by the panel are the creation of a
single board to govern higher education instead of the four existing
now, restriction of admissions at some universities, and
establishment of a community college system.
   ``The present scheme for governing education in Louisiana _ three
operating boards and one coordinating board _ has perpetuated
illegal segregation in Louisiana's higher education even though the
system's creation postdates the filing of this case,'' the judges
said.
   ``The system of multiple boards is therefore a defect in the
state's system of higher education that violates the federal
constitution.''
   The lawsuit was filed 15 years ago by the U.S. Justice
Department. It became clear in December 1988 that the issue could
not be settled, so the three judges appointed Paul Verkuil,
president of William and Mary College in Virginia, to conduct
hearings and write a desegregation plan. He submitted it in May.
   The plan was recommended by Gov. Buddy Roemer when he took office
in 1988.
   ``The state has won. The people have won. I believe we have Buddy
Roemer and three judges to thank,'' said the governor's attorney,
John Kennedy, at a news conference. Roemer was on vacation.
   The court gave the state 30 days to disband the four governing
boards and appoint a new 17-member board. The court declined to set
a ratio of white-to-black members.
   The order calls for Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge to
be designated the flagship university with the greatest number of
graduate and research programs.
   It also calls for creation of an intermediate level of
institutions offering significant doctoral and other graduate
programs, and for gradually merging the LSU law school and the
Southern University law school, both in Baton Rouge.
   The court refused to set the amount of money that must be spent
to adopt the order.
   ``Taking into consideration funds freed by the elimination of
duplicative programs, the board, the president and his staff, shall
develop budgets for the reclassified institutions, including
spending for improving the quality of predominantly black
institutions whenever fiscally possible,'' the court said.
   The jurists who wrote the order were 5th U.S. Circuit Court Judge
John M. Wisdom, U.S. District Judge Charles Schwartz and District
Judge Veronica Wicker.
   Other reaction from around the state was varied.
   Former Gov. John McKeithen, who left the LSU Board last year and
was the first governor to push desegregation, was skeptical.
   ``For the life of me, I don't know any way to make a white go to
Grambling or a black go to Louisiana Tech,'' McKeithen said. ``And
the one board is still going to have its politics. You're going to
have a segment on the board that favors LSU, a segment that favors
USL and one that favors Southern.''
   Larry Crain, president of the Board of Trustees for State
Colleges and Universities, said the court order is a welcome change.
   ``I think all of the boards have been anticipating this for some
time. What we're going to have to do is make it work,'' he said.

<HEAD>Senate Restores Power To Evict Drug Criminals from Public Housing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate unanimously adopted an amendment
Wednesday to restore to public housing authorities the power to
evict drug criminals from federally funded public housing.
   The measure, sponsored by Sens. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., and
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., was added to the Foreign Relations
Authorization Act of 1990.
   ``Today, we have restored the original intent of my provision to
last year's drug bill,'' Moynihan said afterward. ``Don't let it be
said that we didn't get tough. We drew the line. Now we can work
toward our original goal of demanding accountability.''
   During final consideration of the 1989 supplemental
appropriations bill in June, language was added to limit Moynihan's
original eviction provision in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Both
Moynihan and D'Amato voted for the supplemental, not realizing they
were voting to undo the eviction measure, D'Amato said at a news
conference Monday in New York.
   The new provision restores the ability of federal officials to
waive administrative hearings for drug criminals when the hearings
would duplicate eviction proceedings in state courts.
   ``By passing this amendment, we are saying that we will no longer
subsidize violence and criminal activity in public housing,''
Moynihan said Wednesday.
   In considering the same foreign relations authorization bill, the
Senate unanimously passed a Moynihan amendment offering political
and financial assistance to Burmese students.
   The amendment provides $250,000 in refugee assistance for Burmese
protesters living in Thailand, India and border camps; 15
scholarships to Burmese students who have sought asylum outside
their country, which is engaged in civil war; and requests a report
from the attorney general and secretary of state on U.S. immigration
policy toward Burmese protesters.
   The amendment also calls on the administration to continue its
condemnation of human rights violations by the current military
regime in Burma.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski speaks now of
reconciliation and reform, but his martial law declaration of 1981
echoes so loudly in Polish ears that the stern man behind the dark
glasses nearly lost the presidency.
   Earlier this year, his Communist Party shifted course
dramatically and decided to make Solidarity legal again after trying
for more than seven years to obliterate the independent union.
   Jaruzelski's government, aware that the Communists needed help in
controlling Poland's social unrest and economic crisis, offered
talks with the opposition that produced political reforms leading to
Wednesday's presidential election in Parliament.
   ``It would be the greatest drama for me if history one day said
those decisions were wrong,'' he said in a recent interview with The
Associated Press. ``That's why I wish so much that the agreement,
that this pluralism, passes the test in real life.''
   Straight and serious, often seeming remote behind the glasses and
a lifetime's worth of military medals, Jaruzelski is a far cry from
presidential counterparts in the West.
   Little is said of his domestic life and he rarely engages
citizens or reporters in conversation during public appearances.
   He was born July 6, 1923, to an upper-class family in eastern
Poland and was attending a Roman Catholic boarding school in Warsaw
when Poland was invaded at the beginning of World War II.
   His official biography says he ``stayed'' in the northeastern
Soviet Union during the war, working as a laborer. Poles who knew
the family, however, said the Jaruzelskis were caught by Soviet
occupiers and deported a Siberian labor camp, where Wojciech's
father died.
   The young man entered a Soviet officer training school in 1943
and later served with the communist-led Polish First Army, which was
formed in the Soviet Union and fought with the Red Army against the
Nazis.
   Jaruzelski joined the Polish Communist Party in 1947 and rose
through the political and military ranks, becoming defense minister
in 1968.
   In October 1981, at the height of Solidarity's defiance,
Jaruzelski became Communist Party chief, the only career military
officer to hold supreme power in a Soviet bloc country.
   Two months later, he announced martial law. Solidarity was
suppressed, then outlawed and its leaders arrested. Western aid and
investment was cut off and Poland slid into economic crisis.
   ``It was such a difficult and dramatic decision, and for me
personally very painful,'' Jaruzelski said in the AP interview.
   The general has not apologized for martial law or repudiated it,
and he leaves open the question of whether loyalty to the Kremlin or
a patriotic wish to prevent Soviet intervention prompted his action.
   Whatever his motive, the memory of those times has created
profound skepticism about his recent movement toward reform and
democratic change.
   When he told the Communist Party leadership June 30 he would not
run for the new, more powerful presidency, Jaruzelski acknowledged
he was linked too closely to martial law and too little to reform.
   ``I will not crawl to this post,'' Jaruzelski said in the AP
interview two days before the announcement.
   Then came a pledge of cooperation from Lech Walesa, the shipyard
electrician who founded Solidarity and won the 1983 Nobel Peace
Prize, and appearances with President Bush and other Western leaders.
   He changed his mind _ from a ``sense of duty'' was the military
way he explained it _ and ran for the presidency after all.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of the winter couture collections,
opening Sunday, the talk is more about new faces on the French
fashion scene than about hemlines.
   So many Italians are showing that one wonders if it won't be a
spaghetti revolution.
   In May, Gianfranco Ferre took over the chief creative post at
Dior from Marc Bohan, Dior's couturier for 30 years.
   Angelo Tarlazzi was designated as head of Guy Laroche's couture,
following Laroche's death last February. He has long been on the
Paris scene and plans to keep the French-based ready-to-wear firm he
has headed with his own label for 12 years.
   Two other famous Italians, Valentino and Gianni Versace, will
show during couture week _ but separately, rather than as part of
the official French Chambre Syndicale couture group of 23 houses.
   It will be Versace's first-ever showing in Paris. Valentino has
already shown couture once, but has shown his luxury ready-to-wear
for several years. Both are throwing festive parties after their
shows in museums, but Versace's offering might look stilted, since
he's draping his outfits on steel mannequins.
   What do the French think of all these Italians invading the
sacred halls of haute couture? Jacques Mouclier, president of the
Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne, is sanguine.
   ``It's a demonstration of Paris supremacy in fashion that they
all want to come. We don't worry about it. If we subtracted the
foreign designers, we wouldn't have many left. Ungaro is of Italian
origin, and so is Cardin, whose name was Cardini. And think of Karl
Lagerfeld.''
   Born in Germany, Lagerfeld is Chanel's designer and also creates
his own ready-to-wear line in France.
   ``For the last ten years we've been encouraging foreigners _ many
Japanese, Italians and the American Patrick Kelly _ to work and show
their ready-to-wear here.''
   But now Mouclier thinks that the foreign newcomers should do as
Lagerfeld and Tarlazzi did, ``become nationalized or unofficially
French. We'd like to see them give up their commitments abroad and
work only in France.''
   Ferre, 44, will be giving up designing couture under his own name
in Milan, to design for Dior _ arguably the most prestigious couture
label in the world. But he has kept his own ready-to-wear operation
in Milan.
   Ferre's show for Dior will be held in a private mansion, the
Salomon de Rothschild Foundation, followed by a gala dinner for
select clients.
   Fashion-watchers reckon that this is a move to help pacify any of
the rich and fairly conservative women who might find the change
from Bohan to Ferre upsetting.
   Backed by the Agache financial group headed by Bernard Arnault,
which also finances Christian Lacroix, Dior reportedly wanted new
angles and excitement, which Ferre may or may not deliver. Trained
as an architect, he is known for his sharply constructed outfits and
his love of rich fabrics.
   A preview model in a French newspaper showed a wasp-waisted coat
with raised collar worn with spike heels that hinted strongly of the
old ``New Look,'' created by Christian Dior himself in 1947.
   Angelo Tarlazzi said, ``I won't do anything shocking, or
overdressed for the house of Laroche.''
   But he does promise big, long and comfortable coats over skinny
``cigarette'' pantsuits, as well as a version of the sexy backless
sheath created by Guy Laroche for film star Mireille Darc.
   More changes this season: Lanvin, which has been bought by the
Midland Bank, will not be showing couture at all, as designer Maryll
Lanvin left when the new management came in. ``We haven't found a
designer yet,'' said a Lanvin spokesman.
   And Madame Gres _ at 86 the ``doyenne'' of French couture _ will
be showing a collection featuring cocktail clothes and evening
gowns, in the new Gres shop on the Rue du Faubourg St. Honore,
having not shown for two seasons.
   ``The main lines are hers,'' said an assistant. ``But since she
is quite fatigued, she has had a lot of help in details.''
   All over town, couturiers are revving up to lay on their
surprises for next winter, but they are giving out a few previews as
well. So far, it seems that as with ready-to-wear, almost anything
goes: lots of short skirts, a few long and swirly ones, big and warm
coats, and trousers back with a vengeance.

<BYLINE>House Committee Approves Child Care Tax Credits ^By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday
approved $16 billion worth of tax credits and child-care benefits to
lower-income families over the next five years.
   The initiative, which is somewhat more generous than President
Bush recommended for child care but less than the Senate voted, was
approved on a 26-10 vote.
   The action came as members of the tax-writing panel continued to
look for a way to solve a heated controversy over reducing the
income tax surtax that older Americans pay for catastrophic-illness
insurance. Aides indicated there was no progress on that issue
Wednesday.
   The child-care amendments were added to a bill designed mainly to
raise $5.3 billion in revenues for deficit reduction in 1990. The
committee has not decided how to pay for child care, although it is
weighing proposals by Rep. Dan Rosteniowski, D-Ill., the chairman,
that would impose new taxes on mutual life insurance and chemical
companies and make permanent the temporary 3 percent tax on local
and long distance telephone service.
   There is continuing talk among committee members about cutting
the tax on capital gains, which would be expected to raise revenues
for a year or so. Bush has called for a cut but many Democrats are
opposed because most of the direct benefit would go to those with
incomes over $100,000.
   The panel's child-care initiative, which would become effective
in 1991, is ``a giant step forward,'' Rostenkowski told reporters.
   ``I hope the Bush administration will committee itself to its
campaign promise and do something for children,'' he said.
   The proposals would benefit not only families in which both
spouses work outside the home but also those families in which one
spouse stays at home to care for the children.
   The heart of the committee's child-care plan would expand the
existing earned-income credit, which is worth up to $910 a year in
tax cuts _ or in cash if there is no tax liability _ for working
families with children and incomes up to about $18,000.
   The committee voted to raise the maximum credit to $1,217 for a
family with one child; $1,540 if there are two children, and $1,790
if a family has two or more. Under current law, the credit is the
same regardless of the number of children.
   The plan would create a new credit for families with one or more
children under the age of 6. This credit, which would be in addition
to the earned-income credit, would be for 6 percent of the first
$6,500 of earned income, with a top credit of $430 in 1991.
   A third part of the committee's package would authorize $1.55
billion worth of federal grants for social services, with 80 percent
of the money earmarked for improving child-care services.
   By a 20-14 vote the committee rejected an attempt by Rep. Hank
Brown, R-Colo., to eliminate the increase in social-service grants
and use the money to finance an even larger credit for families with
children under 6.
   Unlike the child-care plan passed by the Senate, the Ways and
Means Committee bill does nothing to change the tax credit now
allowed working parents to help offset expenses of caring for a
child. The Senate voted to make that credit available even to
families whose incomes are so low that they owe no tax.

<HEAD>Jim Bakker Refuses to Answer Questions in PTL Aides' Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PTL founder Jim Bakker refused to answer
questions Wednesday in the federal tax evasion trial of two former
aides on grounds he might incriminate himself.
   Bakker appeared only because his attorney failed to quash a
subpoena compelling him to testify for the defense. He entered U.S.
District Court before the jury returned from an afternoon break in
the trial of James and David Taggart.
   David Taggart, 32, was Bakker's top personal aide, and James
Taggart, 35, was the television ministry's interior decorator. The
Taggarts are accused of evading $487,000 in federal income taxes
during their years at PTL. Prosecutors say the two men diverted $1.1
million in ministry funds to their own use.
   Both were fired when Jerry Falwell took over at the television
ministry following Bakker's resignation in March 1987 following
revelations of the Jessica Hahn sex-and-money scandal.
   
   Bakker and Richard Dortch, his former top deputy at the
now-bankrupt television ministry, are to go on trial here Aug. 28 on
24 counts of wire and mail fraud and conspiracy.
   As defense attorney Ben Cotten attempted to ask Bakker a series
of questions Wednesday, the PTL ministry's founder took the Fifth
Amendment.
   ``What was the PTL's policy on cash advance?'' Cotten asked.
   ``On the advice of my attorney, I decline to answer on the
grounds my answer may tend to incriminate me,'' Bakker responded.
   Questions about PTL policy on blank checks and about who hired
the Taggarts in 1983 brought the same reply.
   Asked if he would give the same answer to other questions, Bakker
said, ``Yes.''
   Prosecutor David Brown then asked Bakker whether he knew the
defendants, and asked him about David Taggart's employment contract
and a bonus payment to him. Bakker again refused to answer.
   Judge Robert Potter then released Bakker, saying, ``This court
will not force him to testify.''
   Asked later if he wanted to comment on his reasons for not
testifying, Bakker replied, ``No, the judge has asked that there be
no comment.''
   Bakker, accompanied by attorneys Harold Bender and George T.
Davis, left in their car. Davis said in a telephone interview that
Bakker's refusing to testify Wednesday did not mean Bakker would not
testify at his own trial.
   Testifying earlier in the day, James Taggart described himself as
an artist with no knowledge of several questionable financial
transactions mentioned during the trial.
   ``A lot of these mistakes I'm learning in this courtroom,'' he
said. ``I'm under a microscope and I'm learning.''
   Taggart showed jurors large photos of some of his work. He
appeared relaxed and confident as he recalled the first time Bakker
noticed his design flair, at a party he and his brother held at
their house in 1981.
   ``The interior was very theatrical and dramatic,'' Taggart said.
   Taggart said he almost immediately became involved in the
interior design of PTL's Heritage USA Christian retreat.
   He said one of his first big assignments was decorating Bakker's
vacation home in the Highland Beach, Fla., and that Bakker had only
one request.
   ``As soon I walk into it, I want to know James Taggart did it,''
he recalled Bakker telling him. ``I want the theatrics and flair of
James Taggart.''
   By 1984, Taggart was chief interior designer.
   He testified that Bakker placed great demands on him and put no
limits on how much money he could spend.
   ``He trusted me,'' Taggart said. ``He confided in me.''

<TEXT>
   The House ethics committee was asked Wednesday
to investigate charges that Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., sexually
assaulted a Peace Corps volunteer while on an official trip to Zaire
last March.
   Three of Savage's Democratic colleagues _ Reps. Patricia
Schroeder of Colorado, Matthew McHugh of New York and Barney Frank
of Massachusetts _ formally requested the ethics investigation,
which means the congressional panel must inquire into the
allegations.
   Savage denied the charges.
   ``They tried to destroy Dr. Martin Luther King with a lie. ...
I'm in very good company,'' he told reporters from Chicago
television stations on the Capitol steps.
   At the same time, officials at the Peace Corps said they were
willing to seek disciplinary action against the Chicago Democrat,
but won't do so without the woman's consent.
   ``The ball is in her court,'' said one agency official, who spoke
only on the condition of anonymity. ``It's something we told her
right from the beginning. ... We would go great guns.''
   The Peace Corps worker claims Savage fondled her for more than
two hours in the back of a chauffeur-driven embassy car in Kinshasa,
the capital of Zaire, on March 19, according to several government
officials who confirmed an account originally published in The
Washington Post.
   ``He tried to force me to have sex with him. ... He kept touching
me, after I told him to stop, many times, loudly... He kept saying,
`That's the way the world works,''' she was quoted as saying.
   Savage angrily brushed past a reporter on the House floor
Wednesday and used expletives when she asked for comment. But
outside on the Capitol steps, he offered a different account of the
night in question.
   ``We were in a caravan of four or five cars,'' Savage said in
remarks monitored in Chicago. ``We made four or five brief stops and
got out of the car and got back in. If there were any kind of abuse,
then why would she keep getting back into the same car?''
   He added: ``It doesn't surprise you that the person who remains
independent of plantation politics in Chicago, that that man who
refuses to be bought or to be bossed, that grates hard on some of
you white journalists. ... But that will not stop Gus Savage at
all.''
   Savage is black.
   Neither the government agencies involved nor the Washington Post
has disclosed the woman's name.
   The newspaper account quoted her as saying Savage's advances
continued even though she ``tried everything ... short of hitting
him, or hurting him physically to make him stop.''
   She eventually left her post in Zaire to get counseling and
medical treatment at a Washington hospital and is awaiting another
Peace Corps assignment, the agency official said.
   Jill Gross of the State Department inspector general's office
said the allegations were forwarded in a letter to Rep. Julian C.
Dixon, D-Calif., chairman of the House ethics committee. The
committee had no formal comment.
   The State Department has no jurisdiction in the case, Gross said,
but the allegations ``were brought to our attention'' from
department employees in Zaire and ``they were sufficiently serious
that someone should look into them.''
   She declined to release the letter sent to the ethics committee,
citing confidentiality.
   The three Democrats wrote in a letter to Dixon:
   ``We write to ask the ethics committee to inquire into the
assertion that our colleague from Illinois, Mr. Savage, behaved
improperly towards a federal employee while on a congressional
tour.''
   The two-paragraph letter noted that the lawmakers had no
independent knowledge of the incident, but added: ``We believe that
the accusation is sufficiently serious to justify your looking into
it.''
   The incident allegedly occurred while Savage was on an official
visit to Zaire in mid-March and had dinner one night at the
residence of U.S. Ambassador William Harrop. The dinner attendees
included the Peace Corps volunteer, who was scheduled to brief the
congressman a few days later on agency activities there, an official
said.
   After dinner, Savage insisted the woman ride alone with him in an
embassy limousine while the congressmen, members of his staff and
others visited area bars, the official said.
   As soon as the three cars left the ambassador's home, Savage
``grabbed me,'' the woman told the Post.
   The volunteer tried to flee from Savage at a hotel disco and was
eventually escorted home by an embassy officer, a Peace Corps
official said.
   She reported the incident the next day to Bruce Cohen, Peace
Corps director in Zaire, and Harrop later confronted Savage, this
official added.
   The ambassador ``spoke very strongly'' to Savage and ``chewed him
out as much as an ambassador chews out a congressman,'' an
unidentified witness told the Post.
   The woman did not make a formal complaint against Savage because
she thought it would hurt the Peace Corps, said an official who
added she is still reluctant to initiate a case against the
congressman.
   ``We have a pretty impressive record going against people who
violate Peace Corps types,'' the official said.
   ``If this person is willing to testify, we'll go up to (Capitol)
Hill with it,'' he said.

   The damaged Exxon Valdez was towed toward an
island Wednesday for repairs to enable it to enter port, and no
leaks were observed from the tanker for the third day in a row,
officials said.
   A series of samples taken from the cargo tanks on the ship that
cause the nation's worst oil spill were being analyzed for toxicity
and hydrocarbon content. Results were expected in several days, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer Elizabeth Neely.
   The ship, which was 14 miles south of San Clemente Island on
Tuesday, was to moved to within 7 to 10 miles south of the island on
Wednesday, said Exxon Shipping Co. spokeswoman Jan Cool.
   San Clemente Island is 60 miles northwest of San Diego.
   Cool said Exxon officials were trying to determine whether divers
operating in ocean waters can safely cut off a half dozen steel
plates hanging from the ship's bottom.
   Cool said they would determine whether the work can be done in
the open ocean before taking the tanker into an anchorage just off
the island.
   The plates peeled away during the ship's 2,500-mile journey from
Alaska, where it underwent preliminary repairs after smashing onto a
reef March 24 in Prince William Sound and spilling nearly 11 million
gallons of crude.
   The plates, one of which hangs down about 70 feet, must be
removed so the Valdez can navigate a San Diego Harbor channel whose
depth averages about 40 feet.
   The Valdez is scheduled to undergo a nine-month, $25 million
repair at San Diego's National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., once it
has been declared free of navigational and environmental hazards.
   On July 10, Coast Guard officials suspended the Valdez's
scheduled harbor entry after an 18-mile slick was sighted near the
ship. Discharges of oil mixed with organic compounds such as
plankton continued for several days after that.

   A judge on Wednesday granted a research
lab's request to silence a former technician who complained about
safety and health procedures more than a year before another worker
died of a rare virus.
   International Research and Development Corp. won a preliminary
injunction in Van Buren County Circuit Court against James Casey in
connection with a lawsuit the company filed against Casey and David
Bailey last September.
   IRDC alleges the men violated a confidentiality agreement with
the company by giving statements _ some of which the company says
are false _ to government investigators who were inspecting the
company.
   Judge Meyer Warshawsky ruled that IRDC could suffer irreparable
harm to its reputation if Casey continued making allegations against
the Mattawan company.
   Warshawsky warned Bailey not to discuss the case but did not
include him in the injunction. IRDC had sought to silence Bailey as
well.
   Casey allegedly told inspectors from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration about health and safety problems at the lab,
resulting in several citations and a loss of business, IRDC
attorneys said.
   Warshawsky said that on Monday he would set a date for the trial
of IRDC's lawsuit.
   Casey has countersued the company, contending he was exposed to
dangers at the lab and was fired in retaliation for his complaints
about safety problems.
   The court action comes one month after the death of a technician
who contracted a rare virus from an infected research monkey.
Another former IRDC technician is hospitalized with the infection,
the deadly herpes B virus.
   The company alleges statements made by Casey and Bailey have
contributed to bad publicity and death threats from animal rights
groups.
   Attorneys for Bailey and Casey said their clients' right to free
speech outweighs any harm that might come to the company.
   The independent contract research laboratory tests drugs and
chemicals for medical, pharmaceutical, veterinary and agriculture
companies.
   After seven years as manager of the large-animal toxicology
department, Bailey went to company officials in 1987 to discuss
perceived safety violations, his attorney said.
   ``Nothing happened,'' attorney Craig Lubben said of the company's
response. ``Things became worse ... he feared about the quality of
the testing.''
   In January 1988, Bailey quit after 10 years with the company.
Casey was fired in November 1987 after 10 years with the company.
He, too, had complained to company officials.
   Both men were warned against discussing company operations with
anyone, their attorneys said.
   Company vice president Francis X. Wazeter III testified that his
business depends on confidentiality because the lab tests compounds
that are trade secrets or have patents pending.
   IRDC attorney John Allen said the company could be irreparably
harmed if Bailey and Casey discuss their experiences at the company.
   Casey's attorney, Joseph Cutro, said any bad publicity
surrounding IRDC is the result of last month's death.

   Turkish Cypriot police wrestled with Greek
Cypriot women who forced their way across the island's ethnic
dividing line Wednesday, past U.N. soldiers, to protest the 15th
anniversary of the Turkish invasion.
   The police arrested dozens of the 1,000 women who, accompanied by
a Greek Orthodox bishop and two priests, held a ``Women's Return''
march to protest the invasion that drove them from their homes in
northern Cyprus. The bishop, Chrysostomos of Kition, and a priest,
whose name was not known, also were arrested.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency in Turkey said 109
demonstrators were arrested, including the bishop and the priest.
Four of the detainees were taken to a hospital for treatment of
``minor injuries.''
   Turkish Cypriot police dragged many detainees away by the hair or
clothes. Canadian soldiers of the multiniational U.N. peacekeeping
force on Cyprus formed a human barrier to protect others.
   Police dragged away Steve Weizman, a British reporter for Reuters
news agency, after punching and kicking him. Katherine McElroy, also
of Reuters, was arrested.
   Anatolia said those detained were being held in a gymnasium. The
agency quoted Brig. Gen. Ali Yalcin, the Turkish Cypriot police
commander, as saying they will receive ``legal treatment.''
   Greek Cypriot President George Vassiliou and senior police
commanders held an emergency meeting at the Nicosia police
headquarters. They requested U.N. intenvetion to secure the release
of all detainees, government sources said.
   The women penetrated the ethnic boundary, called the Green Line,
at dusk after scuffling with the Canadian soldiers who patrol it and
knocking down barbed wire barricades at the Ayios Kassianos
neighborhood.
   They occupied a war-damaged elementary school and the St. Georges
Church. Some climbed onto the church roof with a bell and began
ringing it, while others sang hymns in Greek.
   Canadian soldiers warned the women they would not be able to
protect them from Turkish Cypriot policemen gathering by the dozens
only 10 yards away, but were ignored. The buffer zone along the line
is about 50 yards deep at that point.
   Marina Demitriou, an organizer of the march, shouted at the
Canadians: ``You should tell the Turks to go away. This is our land
and we have the right to be here.'' A Canadian officer replied:
``We're trying to protect you. Now please go away.''
   A few minutes later, Turkish riot police supported by dozens of
rifle-carrying soldiers charged into the buffer zone, pushing the
women outside the church onto the ground and arresting some. The
policemen entered the church.
   The organizing committee issued a statement saying the
demonstration was intended ``to reiterate our right to return'' to
the northern third of the island the Turkish army seized in an
invasion that began July 20, 1974.
   Turkey invaded, with the stated intention of protecting ethnic
Turkish Cypriots, because of a short-lived coup against the late
President Makarios led by Greek officers. About 120,000 ethnic Turks
live on Cyprus, making up 17 percent of the population.
   In March, 40 Greek Cypriot women were arrested and held for
several hours after a similar attempt to cross the line.
   Turkish authorities had warned the protesters they would be
arrested and jailed for ``illegal entry'' if they crossed the line
on Wednesdday.
   ``As soon as the women enter our territory, they will come face
to face with soldiers of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus and
the necessary steps will be taken,'' said Rauf Denktash. He is
president of the northern state proclaimed in 1983, which only
Turkey recognizes.
   Maj. Gen. Clive Milner, Canadian commander of the 2,300-member
U.N. force, met protest leaders at his headquarters Tuesday and told
them his soldiers would seek to prevent any attempt to breach the
Green Line.
   The heavily fortified buffer zone stretches 112 miles across the
eastern Mediterranean island and ranges in width from four miles in
open country to as little as three yards in urban areas.
   The U.N. Force in Cyprus has been deployed along the line since
1964. It includes soldiers from Austria, Britain, Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Ireland and Sweden.

<HEAD>Agents Seize Alleged Fish-Smuggling `Kingpin,' Follow Two Ships</HEAD>

   U.S. officials said Wednesday they've netted a
Taiwanese businessman who allegedly masterminded the sale of 550
tons of U.S.-spawned salmon illegally caught on the high seas.
   The sale was made to undercover agents, who arrested Patrick Lee
of Taipei as he carried suitcases holding $1.3 million in cash out
of a Seattle bank vault.
   ``We think he is the kingpin,'' Brian Gorman, spokesman for the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, D.C.,
said of Lee.
   Evidence collected in a six-month sting operation ``demonstrates
the blatant piracy of American salmon on the high seas,'' said
Rolland Schmitten, regional director of the National Marine
Fisheries Service.
   Two associates of Lee also were arrested in Seattle. Three
others, including the captains of the two fishing boats, were in
custody in the mid-Pacific late Tuesday after they had boarded a
fish-transport vessel used by undercover agents acting as buyers of
the salmon.
   Lee and John Chin Wang, formerly of Taiwan but a recently
naturalized U.S. citizen, and Wesley Ming Hsu of Los Angeles were
each charged Wednesday in U.S. District Court with one count of
violating the Lacey Act, which prohibits commerce in illegally
caught salmon or wildlife.
   Jen Chu, an interpreter, and ship captains Tsun Long Lin and Shu
Meng Ging will be charged with violating the Lacey Act when they
arrive in Seattle, said Wayne Lewis, an agent of the National Marine
Fisheries Service in Seattle.
   The maximum penalty for each Lacey Act violation is a fine of
$20,000 and a five-year prison sentence.
   The case probably will be presented to a federal grand jury in
Seattle and additional charges are likely, Lewis said.
   ``This should put the lid on one of the biggest salmon-pirate
operations, and if the others have any brains, they'll sit up and
take notice too,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
   Meanwhile, a 180-foot fish transport vessel and a Coast Guard
cutter tracked the two captain-less Taiwanese fishing vessels some
1,000 miles north of Midway Island.
   The vessels carry part of the 550 tons of salmon that were
supposed to have been delivered to Lee. The price was $1.25 per
pound for the fish.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Brian Hunter said armed boarding parties of
federal agents were aboard bothvessels, and were awaiting permission
to board them. He said the United States has asked permission to
board from the government of Taiwan.
   There was no evidence the thousands of pounds of salmon were
being thrown overboard, as had happened in one recent attempt to
halt a Taiwanese fishing boat in the North Pacific, Hunter said.
   The sting operation began early this year when Lee contacted a
member of the U.S. fishing industry with an offer to sell salmon.
The American company that Lee approached contacted National Marine
Fisheries Service agents.
   Over the next six months, a NMFS agent posed as a buyer and
communicated with Lee over ``monitored'' telephone and fax machines
to arrange the sale, which climaxed in his arrests Tuesday.
   Schmitten said the illicit harvest of U.S.-spawned salmon on the
high seas threatens to destroy American fish runs. ``Unless we stop
it, we're not going to have any fish runs,'' he said.
   The 550 tons involved in the sting sale equals whole season-size
catches of certain species for Washington state fishermen, he said.

   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski won the powerful
new presidency Wednesday without a vote to spare after some
opposition legislators boycotted the election and some members of
his own Communist Party opposed him.
   The Communist Party leader, who imposed martial law in 1981 but
later encouraged reforms that swept Solidarity into the legislature,
said he hoped to unite the nation.
   Jaruzelski, wearing civilian clothes and his customary dark
glasses, was met by applause from Communist lawmakers when he
arrived at the joint session of parliament barely an hour after the
vote and took the oath of office. Solidarity lawmakers were silent.
   ``I want to be a president of reconciliation, a representative of
all Poles,'' Jaruzelski, 66, said in a brief acceptance speech. ``I
will serve the nation. I will serve the fatherland, the one that has
not perished, the one that is and will be.''
   Of the National Assembly's 559 members, 270 voted for Jaruzelski
and 233 against. Thirty-four lawmakers abstained and 15, some of
whom boycotted the election, did not participate. Seven ballots were
counted invalid.
   With 537 valid votes, 270 _ or 50 percent plus one _ was ruled
the number required for election.
   The two-chamber National Assembly has 300 members from the
Communist Party or their allies and 259 members from Solidarity.
   The close vote indicated some dissatisfaction from Communist
hard-liners, who oppose Jaruzelski's compromises with Solidarity.
The Solidarity boycotters may have provided victory by reducing the
number of votes Jaruzelski required.
   Government ministers gave one another the thumbs-up sign as word
of Jaruzelski's victory spread through the chamber.
   Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, Jaruzelski's second
choice for president, was ebullient.
   ``I am very happy. ... He is the best for this office, which will
be so difficult in these times,'' Kiszczak said.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa sent a letter of congratulations to
the general, who suppressed and crushed the independent union early
in the decade, but who later began to advocate reform.
   ``My wish for you is that the time you are given to perform this
office will be a stage in the history of our homeland effectively
leading to freedom and democracy and to regaining Poland's proper
position in Europe,'' Walesa said. Solidarity spokesman Janusz
Onyszkiewicz read the letter to reporters.
   In Washington, the Bush administration congratulated Jaruzelski
and said: ``The choice of leadership is an internal matter for the
Polish people. Our only concern is to see the political and economic
reform process go forward.''
   Since 1985, Jaruzelski has been head of the Council of State, the
collective leadership whose chairman sometimes was referred to as
president. Real power rested with party Politburo, which he also led.
   By electing Jaruzelski, the National Assembly assured him
continued control of the military and foreign relations. The
president also will choose a prime minister, who then will form a
government with parliamentary approval.
   One by one Wednesday, lawmakers filed up to a wooden box at the
front of the chamber and deposited printed paper ballots.
   Many held up ballots showing they were voting against Jaruzelski.
At least three said they weren't participating at all because there
was only one candidate.
   ``I was and I am for Lech Walesa,'' said Sen. Gabriel Janowski of
Siedlce said as he deposited his ballot against Jaruzelski.
   Solidarity's parliamentary floor leader, Bronislaw Geremek,
neither endorsed nor opposed the nomination, but said opposition
lawmakers could not forget Jaruzelski's 1981 martial-law decree,
under which many of them were imprisoned.
   ``We express the hope that the future president ... will act for
the realization of the promises of democratization for the
fulfillment of the promises of change in our country,'' Geremek said
from the podium.
   As lawmakers gathered for the vote, about 50 anti-Jaruzelski
demonstrators from the Confederation for an Independent Poland
rallied outside. ``Jaruzelski Must Go,'' one banner read.
   Some Solidarity members, while not forgiving the general for past
repression, argued that defeating him could undermine reforms needed
to reverse the country's economic decline.
   ``It is a great relief,'' said Sen. Karol Modzelewski of Wroclaw.
``We would have been in real trouble if he did not make it.''
   In its editions Wednesday, the opposition Gazeta Wyborcza said in
an editorial that the new president would be ``a guarantor of a
stable course'' as Poland enters a transition period leading to full
democracy.
   On Tuesday, Jaruzelski cited ``a sense of duty'' and reversed his
June 30 decision not to seek the presidency.
   An announcement by Walesa that he would cooperate with Jaruzelski
as president, and words of praise from President Bush during a visit
last week, may have helped change his mind.
   Jaruzelski must deal with worsening food shortages and inflation
now headed for annual rate of 160 percent. The pressing economic
problems have caused widespread discontent and impelled the
Communist Party's concessions to Solidarity.
   In April, the free trade union movement was made legal again and
allowed to enter candidates in June elections that were the freest
since the Communists gained power four decades ago.

   A strike by 11,000 transit workers
stretched into a second day Wednesday in the nation's largest
province, and shipyard workers in the Baltic port of Gdynia laid
down tools and demanded higher pay.
   The strikes came amid signs of a deteriorating economy, including
a sharp jump in inflation, which is approaching an annual rate of
160 percent. There are shortages of meat and many other goods.
   The strike at the Paris Commune shipyard in Gdynia broke out
spontaneously Wednesday morning, according to the Solidarity
Information Service in Warsaw. It was not immediately clear how many
workers were participating.
   A strike committee was formed of union representatives and
independent workers and was to present management with a list of 13
demands, including higher pay and better work organization, the
inforamtion service said.
   In Katowice province, in southern Poland, talks broke off Tuesday
night in a bus and tramway strike that began in the morning,
paralyzing mass transit. It was not immediately clear what transit
workers were demanding.
   Solidarity representatives said they did not instigate the strike
but were participating in negotiations to bring it to an end.
   The union information service said local authorities were trying
to organize alternative transportation services using buses owned by
state-run cooperatives and private enterprises.
   Katowice province is an industrial area of nearly 4 million
people.

   News that a 9-year-old boy had survived the DC-10
crash at Sioux City, Iowa, broke the pall surrounding United
Airline's posh Red Carpet Room at Stapleton International Airport on
Wednesday evening.
   The doomed jet had taken off from Stapleton about 12:45 p.m.
bound for Chicago's O'Hare International Airport and Philadelphia
International Airport.
   ``Isn't it great. We're taking the first plane out (to Sioux
City). He's alive. He made it,'' an overjoyed Rabbi Avrohom
Brownstein told reporters as he and his wife burst out of the VIP
room where relatives of passengers on the plane had gathered.
   Brownstein, the director of Beth Jacob High School in Denver, and
his wife, Chava, had just received word their son, Yisroel,
nicknamed ``Sroli,'' had survived the crash and was in a Sioux City
hospital with a broken arm and minor burns.
   ``He's OK. He always wanted to have a broken arm anyway. We just
talked to him on the phone and he's OK,'' Brownstein said. He said
his son had been going to Philadelphia to visit friends.
   Mrs. Brownstein said she heard the first reports of the crash on
her car radio.
   ``... Things started filtering in. First the plane was from
Denver, then going to Chicago. I thought to myself, `Oh, no!' And I
had to pull over. I waited for someone to come and get me,'' said
the rabbi's wife.
   Earlier, United employees escorted 25 to 30 visibly shaken
relatives past ranks of reporters and television cameras. The media
was not allowed into the VIP area.
   In Philadelphia, meanwhile, four people with firsthand knowledge
of the pain of losing loved ones rushed to the airport as soon as
they heard about the crash.
   ``The purpose of our visit is to comfort the families, to support
those people who wonder if their family members are alive,'' said
Stan Maslowski of Haddonfield, N.J.
   Maslowski's 30-year-old daughter, Diane, died Dec. 21 when a
terrorist's bomb exploded aboard a Pan Am Boeing 747. The explosion
killed 259 aboard the plane and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie,
Scotland, where the wreckage fell.
   Maslowski said the relatives of the Pan Am victims have formed a
network of more than 400 people who are prepared to rush to airports
to console anyone waiting for a plane that had crashed.
   On Wednesday, their message reached no relatives. Maslowski said
United officials told him no one waiting for passengers had reported
to the airport.
   And at Chicago's O'Hare, a knot of nearly 100 people _ reporters
and curious passersby _ gathered at a lounge next to the gate where
the jet was to have arrived from Denver about 4 p.m.
   People entering the lounge appeared grim. A woman entered crying,
her fingertips at her mouth. Two men leaving refused to speak with a
reporter, one swearing as he brushed by.
   Outside the room, a phalanx of 20 Chicago police officers and
O'Hare security personnel guarded entrance to the lounge.
   At one point, a clergyman was ushered into the room.

   Survivors told of terror and heroism as
their crippled DC-10 struggled Wednesday to reach an airport and
then crashed and broke up while attempting an emergency landing.
   ``The plane came down. It bounced twice, flipped into the air and
we were sitting there upside down and it began to fill up with
smoke,'' said Cliff Marshall of Columbus, Ohio, who was returning
home from Denver.
   ``Then God opened a hole in the basement (the bottom of the
plane) and I pushed a little girl out. I grabbed another, kept
pulling them out until they didn't come no more.''
   Marshall said he thought he helped a half-dozen out and then he
ran.
   There were about 290 people, including 11 crew members, on the
United Airlines flight en route from Denver to Chicago, when it
crashed while trying to land at the airport in this western Iowa
city more than 500 miles from its destination.
   Passenger Charles Martz, 58, of Castle Pines, Colo., said the
scene on the ground after the crash ``looked like a battlefield.
Bodies were strewn all over the place. Bodies had burns, their
clothing burned off, stripped off.
   ``This one gal I just remember seeing had no feet and she was
still breathing a little bit and moaning but what could you do?''
   An unidentified survivor interviewed by KMNS Radio in Sioux City
said that about a half-hour before the crash, ``there was a big,
loud noise that kind of shook the plane.''
   The pilot said there was a problem, he said, and the plane
circled for about a half-hour ``while the pilots figured out what to
do. Then they said we were preparing for a crash landing.''
   ``When we hit, the plane broke right in front of me. It rolled
over twice, I think, then it burst into flames,'' he said. ``I
grabbed an old lady in front of me and a baby and I went out the
plane. Then I looked back and there were flames and I ran into the
cornfield.''
   Passenger David Lansberger told Cable News Network that
passengers were mostly calm as the emergency landing attempt
approached, in part because they were expecting no more than a very
rough landing.
   ``We really thought that we would just land and walk off,'' he
said.
   When the plane hit the ground, ``there was noise everywhere. ...
I just remember thinking, `This is what it is like to die.'''
   Martz, a former Navy pilot who still often flies for his
business, said that when the problem developed, the United pilot
calmly told passengers that there was a problem with the right
engine but the plane could fly ``perfectly well'' without its power.
   ``But I could tell it was worse than that,'' Martz said.
   ``The pilot just before landing came on and said that this may be
more than a rough landing, so do the best you can to assume the
(crash preparedness) position.''
   Ron Rhode of Columbus said he was sitting with an 8-year-old boy,
Ben Radtke of Prairie View, Ill.
   ``The plane hit, bounced and we ended upside down. I let him
go,'' Rhode said.
   Rhode said he and and another passenger, Danny Surue of Chicago,
threw the boy from the plane and then got out themselves. Surue
said, ``The boy was sitting by himself, alone, and they said we were
going to crash, so Ron got up and went over and sat by him.''
   Ben was not hurt, but he said he was afraid he was going to
die.The boy still wore his United Airline badge.
   Rod Vettor, who suffered only bruises in the crash, said
passengers braced for the landing after the pilot announced the
emergency landing.
   Vettor, who was in row 20, said another survivor in row nine told
him the plane split right in front of his seat.
   ``We ended up upside down in a cornfield with fire,'' Vettor
said. ``We did everything we could to get people out of the
airplane.''
   Fifteen-year-old Raina Holbrook from Sioux City, Iowa, saw the
crash as she waited at the airport to take what was to be her first
plane ride. Afterward, she was waiting in line to use the phone when
one of the survivors came up to her and said, ``Can I give you a
hug? I'm just glad to be alive.''
   She said the man was dirty. He just walked up and gave her a hug.

<HEAD>Cuban Withdrawal from Angola Called on Schedule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban troops are withdrawing from Angola on
schedule, the assistant secretary of state for Africa said Wednesday.
   ``Over 26 percent of their troops have left, everything is going
in apple pie order, and the Soviet contribution has been very
useful,'' Herman Cohen told the Cable News Network in an interview
on ``International Hour.''
   ``They helped bring about the agreement signed last September,
they're urging the MPLA to observe the ceasefire, they urged the
MPLA to go into this negotiation. So we're working very closely with
them to make sure it all stays on tracks.''
   MPLA is the Portuguese acronym for the Marxist party that rules
the former Portuguese colony in southwest Africa. Cohen said there
had been about 50,000 Cuban troops supporting it.
   Cohen said Jonas Savimbi, head of the rebel UNITA forces, will
not take part in a new government for a year or 18 months, but then
he would have to get a big job such as prime minister.
   ``I think he has to play a major role in any Angolan government
because he represents at least 40 percent of the Angolan people and
maybe more,'' Cohen said.
   ``So he's going to have a high post. The only way the government
and the country can stay together is if he bring his people along
into it. He has already conceded that the president of Angola with
be the current president, President (Jose Eduardo) dos Santos. So
he's not looking to take over that job.''
   Cohen said Angola will probably have a parliament and a one-party
government, with MPLA and UNITA merged into something new.
   The administrations of former President Ronald Reagan and
President Bush have supported Savimbi. Cohen said he had tremendous
support in Congress.

   Publicly funded programs allowing drug addicts in
Seattle and Tacoma to exchange needles are illegal, the state
attorney general warned Wednesday, but local health officials said
the exchanges will continue.
   The programs have helped control the spread of AIDS by removing
contaminated needles and have drawn some addicts into treatment
centers, the officials said.
   Attorney General Ken Eikenberry's opinion was issued as U.S.
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan in Washington
backed away from earlier support of needle-exchange programs and
told Congress the Bush administration opposes such programs.
   Eikenberry, issuing his opinion in response to a state lawmaker's
request, said Washington state's 1988 AIDS law does not authorize
needle exchanges and that the Legislature failed to amend a 1989
anti-drug law to allow distribution of needles.
   He said it was up to local prosecutors to decide whether to bring
charges against needle distributors. Prosecutors in both cities said
they didn't plan to, at least not immediately.
   ``These people are not trying to commit criminal acts,'' said Tom
Felnagle, chief criminal deputy prosecutor for Pierce County.
   ``It's a narrow construction of the law,'' said Tacoma-Pierce
County Health Department Director Al Allen. ``We plan to continue
operating our program unless the policy of our health board
changes.''
   Tacoma's program was the first in the nation, and Pierce County
won an award this year from the National Association of County
Health Officers for AIDS prevention.
   The needle exchanges were begun in August 1988 by David Purchase,
a former drug counselor who continues his work even though the
program was taken over in January by the county health department.
   ``We're going to keep doing what we do,'' Purchase said in an
interview. ``Our goal is to save lives. The seriousness of the
problem justifies an appropriate effort to prevent the spread of
AIDS.''
   Health officials say the program has substantially reduced needle
sharing by addicts. The sharing of AIDS-infected needles is a major
cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   Counselors distributing needles in the Tacoma area have persuaded
more than 150 addicts to visit drug treatment centers since the
program began, said Terry Reid, manager of the Tacoma-Pierce County
AIDS program.
   Reid said information indicates the exchanges do not encourage
people to start using drugs or to use more drugs.
   Jack Jourden, manager of regional services of the Seattle-King
County Department of Public Health, said the agency plans to
continue the program and has asked for more money in its 1990 budget.
   The city and the county would provide $65,000 to help expand the
program beyond the single needle-exchange center in downtown
Seattle. Tacoma has two such centers.
   The Seattle center provides up to 10 clean needle per week per
addict, bleach for cleaning needles, safe sex information and
referrals to treatment centers. The Seattle program has been under
way for about two months.
   Randy Gainer, assistant city attorney for Seattle, disagreed with
Eikenberry's opinion and said his office told both the local health
department and the city council that the program did not violate
state laws.
   ``There is room to permit'' needle exchanges under current state
law, Gainer said. He would not comment further on Eikenberry's
opinion.
   Republican state Rep. Charles Wolfe of Spokane, who requested
Eikenberry's opinion, said he hoped police would arrest officials in
his city if it proceeds with plans for a needle-exchange program.
   ``If they hand out needles, they would be violating the law. I
believe in upholding the law,'' said Wolfe, a physician in
occupational medicine.
   He said that exchanging needles gives the wrong message to young
people.
   The AIDS law created a division in the state Department of Social
and Health Services to finance AIDS tracking, treatment and
education.
   The anti-drug legislation was a $70 million package of three
dozen bills including tougher laws on drug dealing and education and
treatment.
   The Legislature banned needle exchanges in one of the drug bills,
but Gov. Gov. Booth Gardner vetoed the ban.

<TEXT>
   President Daniel Ortega marked the 10th
anniversary of the Sandinista revolution Wednesday by calling for
President Bush to ``stop his policy of war against Nicaragua'' and
disband the Contras.
   ``Today the people are better off than before 1979,'' Ortega told
more than 100,000 people who jammed the Plaza of the Revolution
along the shores of Lake Managua.
   ``Better days are coming,'' he said as the chanting and singing
crowd held aloft a sea of the red-and-black flags of the ruling
Sandinista National Liberation Front.
   Ortega said the rally showed the depth of Sandinista support 10
years to the day after they took power following the defeat of
dictator Anastasio Somoza, whose family had ruled Nicaragua with
U.S. support since the 1930s.
   In Washington, President Bush issued a statement saying the
Sandinistas had failed to live up to their decade-old promise of
democracy.
   But now, ``with the eyes of the world upon them, the Sandinistas
have another opportunity to give peace and democracy a chance,''
Bush said in reference to coming Nicaraguan elections.
   Until Wednesday, celebrations had been low-key, in part due to
Nicaragua's miserable economic state, which left many unenthusiastic
about the Sandinistas.
   But when rain clouds that had dampened the city cleared away,
thousands flowed into the plaza. Soviet-made MI-17 helicopters with
news photographers aboard circled overhead.
   Most of those at the rally were young people, chanting ``The land
is ours!'' and ``We have 10 (years) down and we continue ahead!''
   In his 50-minute speech, Ortega said his government is
controlling inflation, which reached an estimated 20,000 percent
last year, and accused the United States of ``imperialist
aggression'' for maintaining an economic boycott and blocking
financial credits.
   Ortega also praised two people who were once allies but have now
become enemies: Alfonso Robelo, who became a leader of
anti-Sandinista forces, and Violetta Barrios de Chamorro, publisher
of the opposition newspaper La Prensa.
   Ortega claimed the throng at the plaza topped 300,000, but
observers estimated it at between 150,000 to 200,000.
   Ortega said the rally showed the Sandinistas have at least that
many votes assured for next year's elections. He said the Sandinista
show of strength might scare the opposition into abstaining.
   ``But let's all be very clear about this ... they can take or
leave the elections, but there will be elections on Feb. 25, 1990,''
Ortega said. ``And they will be clean and honest elections.''
   Ortega has said he is willing to talk to the political opposition
to discuss further reforms to electoral and news media laws.
   The opposition claims the Sandinistas have an unfair advantage
for the elections, set as part of an agreement among Central
American presidents that also calls for dismantling the
U.S.-supported Contra guerrillas.
   ``The United States still hasn't decided to respect the rights of
the nations of the Third World and of Nicaragua,'' Ortega said.
   ``If the president of the United States is for peace he should
stop immediately his policy of war against the people of Nicaragua
and should let the Contras be dismantled from Honduran territory,''
Ortega said.
   Most Contras, as the U.S.-backed anti-Sandinista rebels are
known, moved to camps in neighboring Honduras after U.S. military
aid ended and their leaders and the Sandinistas signed a truce in
March 1988.
   However, pockets of Contras still roam northern and central
provinces and occasional skirmishes are reported. Non-lethal U.S.
aid continues.
   Recalling the first few months of the revolution, Ortega gave
guarded praise to Mrs. Chamorro and Robelo, who were members of the
Junta of National Reconstruction that took control after the
Sandinistas entered Managua on July 19, 1979.
   Mrs. Chamorro, a powerful symbol of the upper-class stand against
Somoza, resigned from the junta a year later and said the
Sandinistas' goals were incompatible with her hopes for a democratic
Nicaragua.
   She now is a leading opposition presidential contender, according
to polls.
   Ortega said Mrs. Chamorro's decision not to accept ``conditions
that the gringos wanted to impose on the junta'' was ``firm and
courageous.''
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the Sandinista Front,
published a special edition with an editorial that called the last
10 years ``exciting, agitated, tormenting, hard and sweet.''
   The newspaper's front page had no stories, only two huge pictures
of happy people and, in big red letters, ``Ten Years of Change and
Victory ... Better Days Are Coming.''
   Of Robelo, Ortega said he recalled his attraction to common
people and said ``he even wore the red-and-black kerchief (of the
Sandinista Front) and sang `workers to power' (part of a
revolutionary song).''
   ``But he couldn't make the jump,'' said Ortega.
   Robelo, a millionaire industrialist, joined the directorate of
the Nicaraguan Resistance, the umbrella organization of
anti-Sandinista guerrilla and political forces. He resigned last
year to run a party that tentatively plans to take part in next
year's elections.
   A recent Swedish-sponsored economic study said per capita output
in Nicaragua last year was $300, making it the poorest nation in the
hemisphere. The Sandinistas have maintained the $300 figure is far
too low.

   A man described as ``an obsessive fan'' of
Rebecca Schaeffer was held Wednesday in Arizona for investigation
into the shooting death of the actress who starred in ``My Sister
Sam.''
   Authorities filed a felony arrest warrant Wednesday for Robert
John Bardo, 19, of Tucson, a former fast-food restaurant worker who
was arrested by Tucson police earlier Wednesday for running in front
of cars.
   Miss Schaeffer, 21, was shot Tuesday by a man who stood outside
the building for nearly four hours, witnesses said. A neighbor said
a man was flashing a picture of the actress and asking where she
lived hours before the shooting.
   Bardo was ``an obsessive fan of Miss Schaeffer,'' said Deputy
District Attorney Robert E. Savitt, who filed the complaint.
   After arresting Bardo, Tucson police called Los Angeles because
of statements he made, said Lt. Fred Nixon, a Los Angeles police
spokesman.
   Miss Schaeffer, star of recent movies in addition to the ``My
Sister Sam'' television series also starring Pam Dawber, was shot
once in the chest at 10:15 a.m. in the city's tony Fairfax district,
police said.
   The killer may have rung her doorbell. Police Detective Dan
Andrews said the actress may have known the assailant or ``was just
a trusting person.''
   Andrews said police were tipped by a friend of Bardo's living in
Tennessee, who called police headquarters about 2 a.m. Wednesday to
tell them of ``Bardo's obsession.''
   Andrews said the woman told police that Bardo said he had a video
collection of ``My Sister Sam'' shows and an autographed publicity
photo of the actress. He said Bardo had sent a letter to Miss
Schaeffer about a year ago, ``but there is no indication she ever
saw it.''
   ``I wouldn't call it a threatening letter. I would call it an
affectionate letter, but a bit rambling,'' he said.
   Andrews said ``He also expressed to his friend that he was going
to harm Miss Schaeffer.'' But the detective said it was unclear to
investigators why Bardo allegedly might have wanted to harm the
actress.
   ``There is an indication that there was an ongoing attempt to
contact her,'' Andrews said, adding that Bardo had called Miss
Schaeffer's agency several times in the past.
   Bardo appeared to be very tired and dirty when discovered on the
freeway, said Tucson police spokesman Sgt. Paul Hallums. Bardo
formerly worked at a Tucson fast-food restaurant and reportedly
attended a Tucson high school, he said.
   ``The guy's real passive with everybody. He's being passive and
polite with everybody,'' Hallums said.
   Hallums said the man was wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and
sandals, ``had dark hair, kind of shaggy.''
   Neighbor Irene Tishkoff said Tuesday she saw a ``bookish
looking'' man with curly brown hair flashing the photo of Miss
Schaeffer hours before the slaying.
   ``He stopped me and he pulled this picture out of a large manila
envelope packed with junk and it was her,'' she said. ``He asked if
I had seen this girl in the neighborhood. I said, `What?' and just
turned away. I thought it was strange.''
   Police found no indication that Miss Schaeffer was being
harassed, Andrews said. A former boyfriend was questioned, but was
not a suspect.
   ``She didn't have an enemy in the world,'' said her agent,
Jonathan Howard. ``She was a very successful young actress, on the
ascent, getting job after job. I can't believe this has happened.''
   Witnesses said the attacker was seen standing outside the
two-story building at least since 6:30 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``I was in the kitchen making coffee and I heard what sounded
like a car backfiring,'' said Richard Goldman, a television
screenwriter who lives across the street. ``After the pop, there
were two bloodcurdling screams.
   ``I looked out the window and I saw a guy in a yellow shirt
jogging at a fair clip ... as if it was ball four and he was running
to first base.''
   Neighbor Kenneth Newell rushed to help Miss Schaeffer. ``I felt
her pulse. I couldn't feel any,'' he said.
   The actress was pronounced dead at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
about 30 minutes later, said hospital spokeswoman Peggy Shaff.
   Miss Schaeffer appeared on ``My Sister Sam'' on CBS from 1986 to
1988, playing Patti Russell, the younger sister of Miss Dawber's
character, Sam.
   ``Words cannot express the grief and rage that I feel,'' Miss
Dawber said in a statement from New York.
   Miss Schaeffer once moved into Miss Dawber's California home so
the two could develop a convincing relationship for the show.
   A native of Eugene, Ore., Miss Schaeffer worked as a model in
Japan in 1984, doing commercials and magazine covers. Upon her
return to the United States, she took a regular role in the ABC soap
opera ``One Life to Live.''
   She also appeared in the Woody Allen film ``Radio Days'' and an
episode of the NBC series ``Amazing Stories.''
   She was most recently seen in the feature film ``Scenes From the
Class Struggle in Beverly Hills'' and had just completed a
co-starring role in ``One Point of View,'' an upcoming feature
directed by Dyan Cannon.
   Miss Schaeffer returned recently from Italy, where she had a
supporting role in a TV miniseries about the hijacking of the cruise
ship Achille Lauro.
   The attack was chillingly reminiscent of the one suffered by
``Raging Bull'' actress Theresa Saldana in 1982 when a deluded fan
seriously wounded her with a hunting knife outside her West
Hollywood home.
   Similarly, former Beatle John Lennon was slain Dec. 8, 1980 by a
deranged fan outside his New York apartment, and after ``Taxi
Driver'' established her fame, actress Jodie Foster attracted the
attention of John Hinkley Jr., who tried to assassinate President
Reagan in 1981 to impress her.

   President Bush on Thursday will seek to commit
the United States to building a manned outpost on the moon and
sending astronauts to Mars, an administration official said
Wednesday.
   Bush will not outline a specific proposal but will endorse the
concept of a moon-Mars mission, which was recommended by Vice
President Dan Quayle and the National Space Council that Quayle
chairs, said the official.
   The official revealed the president's decision on condition of
anonymity.
   Bush's announcement will come in a major space policy speech
outlining his goals to revitalize the nation's space program on the
20th anniversary of man's first visit to the moon.
   The speech will include no timetables or cost estimates, the
official said.
   Another official said Bush will ask Quayle and the National Space
Council to flesh out the proposal with specifics.
   The moon-Mars recommendation originated in the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, which sent it to the president
via Quayle and the council.
   Bush's speech Thursday will include a ``pretty general two- or
three-sentence kind of goal,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said earlier.
   As he weighed his decision, Bush spoke to Quayle about the matter
on Tuesday and planned to discuss it with him again Wednesday by
telephone from California where the vice president is on a speaking
tour.
   ``There's a lot of analysis that needs to be considered,
especially in terms of cost'' to maintain a human outpost on the
moon and to mount a Mars mission, Fitzwater told reporters. ``It is
a costly venture and those aspects need to be considered.''
   At NASA, Dr. Frank Martin, the head of the exploration office,
said such a project would more than double the current NASA budget
of some $13 billion a year, pushing it above 2 percent of the total
federal budget.
   Congressional leaders who spoke to reporters at the White House
after meeting with Bush on other topics voiced caution about the
cost of such a proposal.
   ``We will be ... anxious to come together with a program that can
provide continued American involvement in projects of importance and
scientific value,'' said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley. ``but
obviously we also have to consider the problems that we have here at
home. We have resources that are not as unlimited as they once were.
... Certainly we are under very great budget restraints.''
   Fitzwater said while Bush was aware of those restraints he also
is committed to furthering exploration of space.
   Bush on Tuesday told reporters that any space proposal he makes
must pass a ``test of fiscal sanity, fiscal reasonableness.''
   Quayle hinted at a bold Bush proposal, saying in San Diego that
the administration was moving toward action on ``another great leap
forward in space.''
   He called for ``expanding the human presence into the solar
system _ as a long-term goal'' and said that by the year 2000 the
nation ``must be on our way to pioneering the Solar System and
establishing outposts on the moon and Mars.''
   The recommendation before the president did not include another
idea that had surfaced previously, a joint space venture with the
Soviets, two officials said.

   A federal official says the United States wants
decisive action by Cuba against drug-smuggling, as that country
makes overtures for a joint anti-drug campaign, including a reported
meeting with a State Department official.
   Word of the meeting between a top Cuban diplomat and Michael
Kozak, deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, came Tuesday from Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
   However, another State Department official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said, ``We have raised narcotics with the
Cubans on many, many occasions over the years.''
   ``We certainly think there's ample room for the Cubans to take
action,'' he said. ``We're looking for deeds rather than just
words.''

   High tide has a new meaning these

   Dozens of bundles of cocaine with an estimated street value of $5
million have washed up along more than 200 miles of coast during the

area's tiny fishing and resort towns.
   ``Everybody's talking about it and I think everybody's looking

   The Energy Department is underestimating the
chances of a volcanic eruption near a Nevada site proposed to entomb
high-level nuclear waste that will remain radioactive for 10,000
years, a senior government geologist says.
   Department officials say the analysis by John Trapp, a staff
geologist at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is flawed. But they
acknowledged Tuesday that more study is needed before determining
whether the site can be used.
   Trapp, in what he called preliminary calculations, said his
review of the Yucca Mountain site and assessments by Energy
Department scientists show the chances of an eruption in the area
during the next 10,000 years are about one in six, not the one in 30
odds suggested in department studies.
   The proposed site is about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas.

   Congressional smoking opponents, seeking a ban
on smoking aboard all U.S. airliners, will ask a House panel to
overrule a subcommittee vote keeping only the current ban for
flights under two hours.
   In a series of parliamentary moves aimed at heading off a total
ban, pro-smoking forces won their first victory in the House Public
Works and Transportation aviation subcommittee on Tuesday.
   ``They're probably all out there puffing happily right now,''
said Rep. James Oberstar, subcommittee chairman.
   The subcommittee voted 17-18 against a move to extend the
temporary ban on two-hour flights to cover permanently all flights
up to four hours. Oberstar's bill proposing a total ban was amended
to extend the ban on two-hour flights from April 23, 1990, to April
23, 1992.

<HEAD>Tennessee Bingo Ban Upsets Players, Hurts Charities</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Louises were adamant. They had been
punished for something that wasn't their fault.
   ``You know how much I like bingo? This is my 40th wedding
anniversary and I'm here and my husband's sitting at home,'' said
Louise Sharp, one of about 70 players at a reinstituted game run by
the Knoxville Association for the Blind.
   ``If I do something, I can tell you in a split second if I've
sinned or not,'' said Louise McCall. ``I don't feel like I've sinned
when I play bingo.''
   Until mid-June, the two bingo veterans had been denied their
favorite pastime for more than three months. The game they attended
this night was legal only because participants weren't required to
pay to play.
   They and thousands like them are angry that their game of choice
got caught in a vise, at the same time robbing charities of a major
source of income.
   The state Alcoholic Beverage Commission suspended all bingo
licenses March 9 after the state Supreme Court ruled the games are
lotteries, which are banned by a section of the state constitution
that's been on the books since 1835.
   Before that, churches and other tax-exempt groups could play for
charity as long as they filed necessary paperwork. But unscrupulous
operators were taking advantage of the profit potential. In 1986,
then-Attorney General Michael Cody said less than 2 percent of $44
million in bingo proceeds went to charity.
   Many players are going to games in neighboring states now that
they can't play at home. A bingo operator in Bristol, Va., said the
crowds ``more or less doubled'' immediately after the ban went into
effect. That has waned, he said, but several new bingo games have
sprung up near the border.
   Some Tennessee operators are taking a chance of their own by
offering free games they hope will skirt the gambling issue by
requesting donations.
   Bingo fans who come to the Algood Rod and Gun Club across the
street from the Algood Police Department about 75 miles east of
Nashville are asked to give $20. Someone who didn't pay would be
pointed out to other patrons, said owner Harold Chaffin. ``They
would probably like to know who didn't give.''
   The free games still give prizes, although the size is determined
by the generosity of donors. Attorney General Charles Burson said
local prosecutors would have to examine each operation to decide
whether to press charges.
   Other groups are meeting the gambling issue head on.
   The Benevolent Bingo Operators of Tennessee, mostly veterans
groups, spent over $25,000 lobbying for a constitutional convention
on lotteries. The effort went nowhere in the General Assembly, which
has adjourned for the year.
   One problem with amending the constitution is that by law,
Tennessee can hold a constitutional convention only every six years.
The state does not have an income tax, and tax reform of some sort
is given priority by many government officials. They oppose a
convention just on gambling because it would delay a vote on an
income tax, and they are not ready for a tax reform convention.
   The Bingo Operators asked the state's 750 registered charities to
support the effort. Group President Jim Fuller, general manager of
American Legion Post 43 in Tullahoma, said the ban would hurt
hundreds of legitimate charities.
   ``It's put us in a bind we're trying to work around and recover
from,'' said the Rev. Thomas Kirk, rector of the Cathedral of the
Immaculate Conception in Memphis. ``Some of our schools were hit
harder than others.''
   The school at his church derived up to $40,000 a year from bingo,
Kirk said. ``To this point we've been able to operate on a surplus
we had available, but we will have to have fund-raisers of other
kinds.''
   St. Michael's Catholic Church in Memphis averaged about $30,000 a
year, said business manager Diane Harder. ``We're looking for other
ways to raise that money. Right now the projection is that not one
alternative will handle it. It will probably have to come through
several fund-raising projects.''
   At St. Patrick's Catholic Church, 50 miles west of Nashville in
McKuen, organizers of what is billed as the world's largest barbecue
planned a variety of fund-raisers in hopes of making up for lost
bingo revenue. But they said the 135-year-old, late-July picnic,
which drew 20,000 people last year, would likely take in only about
half its normal amount.
   The Fraternal Order of Police lodge in Bristol was raising about
$8,000 a month through bingo for volunteer fire departments and
rescue squads, said Kent Bradford, former manager. ``We gave $1,000
each to 10 different organizations in January. We spent about
$10,000 on the Christmas fund for food baskets, a Santa Claus,
dinner and so forth.''
   Since the ban, the FOP has ``lost our building, which was our
meeting place,'' Bradford said. ``We lost everything we could do as
a charitable organization. We just lost it all.''

   Underwater scientist Robert D. Ballard is
becoming host of ``National Geographic Explorer'' on SuperStation
TBS because he says the movie and television image of scientists is
driving young people away from science careers.
   ``We're going to change the show's emphasis to more live
exploration,'' said Ballard, the man who found the Titanic and the
Bismarck and recently led an expedition to a sunken Roman ship. That
effort was telecast live to several hundred thousand youngsters in
12 museums across the country.
   His discovery of the Nazi battleship Bismarck, resting upright in
15,000 feet of water about 600 miles west of Brest, France, will be
shown in an October episode of the weekly ``Explorer'' series. The
fabled World War II ship was sunk in a battle with British naval
forces on May 27, 1941. Ballard found the ship June 8.
   ``I want to motivate children and show them that science is a
contact sport,'' said Ballard, who will become host in September.
``We've created an image that scientists are nerds. And that's
created a devastating effect on interest in science as a career.
   ``The battle for children's minds is between grades four to 12.
Right now 50 percent of all the students in American colleges
studying sciences are foreign students. We're now 17th in the world
in science literacy, behind Spain, Hungary and Ireland and
hopelessly behind Germany, Japan, England and the Scandinavian
countries.''
   He warned that if more American students don't become interested
in science the United States will slip economically, industrially
and militarily.
   ``The image children have of scientists is that of a harebrained,
forgetful wacko that they get from movies like `Back to the
Future,''' said Ballard. ``Children want to fit in with their peer
groups, they don't want to look like some silly guy.''
   Ballard is more in the mold of Indiana Jones. He has participated
in or led more than 60 deep-sea expeditions. He is a senior
scientist in the Ocean Engineering Department of the Woods Hole
Oceanographic Institution, head of the Deep Submergence Laboratory
and director of the institution's Center for Marine Exploration.
   The 50,000-ton Bismarck was the biggest battleship launched by a
European power and was such a threat to the Allies that British
Prime Minister Winston Churchill ordered an all-out effort to ``sink
the Bismarck.''
   The Bismarck sank the British battle cruiser Hood on May 24,
1941, but two days later British torpedo planes damaged the ship's
steering gear and rudders. The crucial battle came the next day.
   ``The Germans lost their main guns and control in the battle,''
said Ballard. ``The captain ordered the ship scuttled at 10 o'clock.
She was equipped with the latest in military technology and he
didn't want the ship captured. The ship was struck by more torpedoes
at 10:36 and sank three minutes later. Of 2,200 crewmen aboard the
Bismarck, only about 115 survived.
   ``The ship capsized and its gun turrets, which were held in place
by their weight, fell out. She landed upright and other than the
missing turrets and some superstructure damage she is in remarkable
condition. The Nazi swastikas are still visible on her deck.''
   The Bismarck was examined by the deep-sea robot Argo, which
Ballard also used to find the Titanic four years ago. The robot is
equipped with sonar, video cameras and still cameras. Pictures taken
by Argo, its tender and the mother ship on the surface will be used
in the ``Explorer'' program in October.
   The Jason Project in the Mediterranean Sea explored a 3rd Century
Roman ship and undersea volcanoes. Six one-hour shows of the
exploration were sent live by satellite to 12 museums in a two-week
period. Each museum had an exact replica of the control facilities
aboard the other ship so that the youngsters saw exactly what
Ballard saw only one-half second later.
   Future live television projects will take Ballard to the Great
Lakes to look for two ships sunk in the War of 1812, to Lake
Champlain to look for a gunboat sunk in the Revolutionary War, to
the Pacific off Okinawa to explore the Japanese battleship Yamata
and to the Pacific to examine the Japanese aircraft carriers that
attacked Pearl Harbor and were sunk in the Battle of Midway.
   ``We have a large program of exploration lined up and will have
the continued involvement of young people,'' Ballard said. ``We'll
take some children into the field, but most will participate by
telepresence. It will almost be like being there because they will
be surrounded by video pictures. On the Great Lakes project we will
have joy sticks in the museums that will let the youngsters actually
control the robot.''

   Anti-war and anti-abortion activists are
working together in some cases.
   That was so in recent demonstrations at the Seneca Army Depot and
at a Highland Hospital abortion clinic, reports Religious News
Service.
   It said most of the activists at the Army depot were
anti-abortion protest veterans and most of the protesters at the
abortion clinic were veteran anti-war protesters.
   The Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit priest and leading figure in
the anti-war movement, helped coordinate both protests. A
10-foot-long banner proclaimed the linkage this way: ``War is
abortion, abortion is war.''
   Organizations combining protests against war and abortion include
Plowshares, which organized the demonstrations here, an evangelical
group called JustLife and the group Pro-Lifers for Survival.

   The annual conference of the Church of the
Brethren has decided to develop a new denominational statement on
peace-making.
   This is something the 155,000-member church has emphasized since
its founding in 1708.
   One of three historic ``peace'' churches, along with the
Mennonites and Quakers, the Brethren agreed a new positive statement
is needed to help people live as peace-makers in all aspects of life.

   The Rev. Avery Post, retiring after 12
years as president of the United Church of Christ, says that
``obsessive devotion'' to the American flag is among national
``signs of pathos and vulnerability.''
   More worrisome, he says, are ``those who are exploiting this
insecurity and vulnerability for political ends.''
   In his parting keynote address to the denomination's recent
general synod, Post urged it not to get bogged down in conflict over
subsidiary issues, but also not ``to sit at ease in Zion.''
   He added, ``Biblical faith introduced me to a justice lifestyle
at the beginning of my ministry, and I expect to stay on the case
for God's justice until the end of my days.''

<HEAD>Races Exchange Bows in New Methodist Hymnal</HEAD>

   Blacks pay respects to whites and whites pay
respects to blacks in a new United Methodist hymnal being
distributed to congregations across the country.
   The mutual consideration is reflected in the lyrics as well as in
the broad range of selections, from European-derived classics to
slave spirituals.
   Female also gets included along with male in the language about
people, such as substituting ``all'' for ``men.'' But references to
God and Jesus remain mostly male.
   ``There were trade-offs,'' says the Rev. Carlton R. Young, editor
of the hymnal, whose repertoire of 625 numbers includes 300 new
ones. Many are evangelical-style gospel songs and black spirituals.
   ``It was a process of give-and-take, which is how Methodists have
stayed Methodists all these years,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his Nashville, Tenn., office.
   For example, in the newly included black spiritual ``Every Time I
Feel the Spirit,'' the ethnic pronunciation is ``Ever Time Ah Fil de
Spirit,'' but the book puts the song in standard English.
   ``To put it in dialect would have been very ill advised,'' said
the Rev. William Farley Smith, a Harlem pastor and member of the
hymn committee that compiled the new book, replacing a 1966 version.
   ``That would have turned off whites and made it so only ethnics
would sing it. This would detract from the original intent and be
discrimination in reverse. It would have left out all the Anglos.
   ``They're not used to the ethnic pronunciations. But blacks know
it already and sing it. In the book, we put the words in proper
English so as to accommodate whites.''
   On the other hand, several hymns were modified to eliminate
anti-black implications, such as getting rid of metaphors equating
``white'' with purity or godliness.
   However, the big change is the inclusion of 122 revival-style
gospel songs and black spirituals, many of them widely popular but
new to the book, and also 17 Hispanic hymns, 14 of Asian origin and
seven from American Indians.
   About 4 million copies of the new hymnal are expected to be in
hands of most of the 38,000 congregations of the 9 million-member
denomination by Octorber.
   It's the first time for Spanish-language hymns to be included,
songs such as ``Camina, Pueblo de Dios'' (Walk On, O People of God,)
and ``Mantos ye Palmas'' (Filled with Excitement). Lyrics also are
given in English.
   Smith, pastor of Harlem's St. Mark's United Methodist Church,
said the book's emphasis on spirituals and gospel hymns will help
regain the evangelistic fire marking Methodism's origins.
   ``We started out as a tent-revival church but have tended to
become cathedrals of liturgical formality,'' he said. ``Now we're
going to recapture our old spirit and the book will help do that.''
   Among familiar but newly included gospel songs are ``I Surrender
All,'' ``Nothing But the Blood of Jesus,'' ``In the Garden,'' ``Pass
Me Not O Gentle Savior'' and ``Shall We Gather At the River.''
   Among newly included spirituals are ``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,''
``Go Down, Moses,'' ``This Little Light of Mine,'' ``It's Me, It's
Me O Lord, Standing in the Need of Prayer'' and ``Oh Mary Don't You
Weep.''
   However, the book retains traditional favorites, including 60 by
Methodist founder John Wesley and his brother, Charles.
   In many cases, selections were mae by popular demand, as happened
when a wave of protests reversed a committee move to drop the
martial-style ``Onward Christian Soldiers'' and ``Battle Hymn of the
Republic.''
   As for response from members now that the book is getting into
the pew racks, the Rev. Richard S. Parker of the suburban, largely
white United Methodist Church in Port Washington, N.Y., said, ``Most
people find it's better. They're getting used to it and like it.
They feel the process of producing it was fair, that the church
listened to them.''
   However, a member, Valerie Lau, objected to the inclusive
language for people. ``It was just to satisfy a group of women's
libbers, and I'm a traditionalist. But this, too, will pass.''
   Smith, whose black Harlem congregation was one of the pilot
churches trying out the hymnal, said, ``We've been using it all
along, and it has worn very well. Our people are very happy with
it.''
   The Rev. Warren Danskin of Manhattan's John Street Church,
America's oldest Methodist church, said that from the sampling so
far, ``our folks are very pleased.''
   Young, a church music scholar who has led the project for five
years of committee sessions and church hearings across the country
to get input from members, said: ``There's a great surge of interest
in this hymnal. The people know that what is there is what they want
to sing.''

<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Simply put, the question was who should be
counted as a person and who, if anybody, should not. But there's
nothing simple about it.
   The Senate voted one answer and, in effect, invited the Supreme
Court to decide whether it was right or wrong.
   That happened because in the arithmetic of congressional
reapportionment, every question becomes complex, contentious and
politically charged.
   The point at issue in Senate debate on a new immigration bill was
whether illegal aliens should be counted in the process that will
reallocate House seats among states after the 1990 census. There
could be enough of them to shift seats away from at least five
states to Sun Belt states with large numbers of illegal residents.
   Nobody is certain because counting illegal aliens is a hard thing
to do, given the fact that they don't want to be spotted by the
government. Then again, the Census Bureau maintains that not
including them, and still coming up with an accurate 1990 population
count, would be even more difficult. ``A census of only legal
residents cannot be done as accurately as a census of all
residents,'' according to Census Bureau testimony to Congress.
   After the 1980 census, the government estimated that there were
2.57 million people in the United States illegally. There were other
guesses, some of them far higher. The government made no attempt to
count them out in the redistricting process; indeed, the two
previous administrations decided that the Constitution required that
the census cover illegal aliens along with citizens.
   There is not likely to be any change in that prior to the 1990
census next spring. The Senate has passed an immigration bill
including an amendment that would cut illegal aliens from the
redistricting numbers, but it is not likely to clear Congress before
the next year's national head count.
   Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., proposed, and won, the immigration
bill amendment that is supposed to exclude illegal aliens from the
redistricting process. It would give Secretary of Commerce Robert
Mosbacher the assignment of adjusting the census figures so that
illegal aliens don't count for purposes of redistributing House
seats. It does not come with instructions, so the department would
have to figure out how.
   Shelby's amendment says only that the secretary is to ``make such
adjustments in total population figures as may be necessary, using
such methods and procedures as the secretary determines feasible and
appropriate'' to keep illegal aliens from being counted in
congressional reapportionment.
   That task would be perilous politically, since it would involve
taking House seats away from some states and giving them to others,
all on the basis of estimates. With 435 seats in the House, every
representative gained by a state is a representative lost by another.
   Opponents of the Shelby amendment, led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., said it was unconstitutional, as well as unworkable. ``The
framers of the Constitution intended to count all persons,'' Kennedy
said.
   The Constitution itself says the apportionment of the House is to
be determined on the basis of ``the whole number of free persons,''
excluding Indians and counting every five slaves as three persons.
That was amended after the Civil War to say that the apportionment
of House seats will be based on ``the whole number of persons in
each state.''
   Neither the original article nor the amendment mentions
citizenship in connection with apportionment, although the term
``citizens'' is used in some other provisions. Opponents of the
amendment said that showed the authors of both documents wanted
everybody counted for purposes of apportionment.
   But Sen. Alan K. Simpson, R-Wyo., said the people who wrote the
documents had no concept of illegal aliens because there weren't any
in their time.
   That came later, with immigration restrictions that began in 1875.
   Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said the question
should be put squarely to the Supreme Court. He said it is unfair to
count illegal aliens in reapportionment. ``It just does not make any
sense,'' Dole said. ``It does violate the constitutional principle
of one man, one vote.''
   But opponents of the Shelby measure said apportionment doesn't
involve who votes and who doesn't. Women couldn't vote when the
Constitution and the 14th Amendment were adopted, but they always
were counted. Children can't vote, but they count, too.
   The amendment was adopted after the Senate voted 58 to 41 against
a move to reject it, and 56 to 43 against scuttling it as
unconstitutional.
   Shelby said that is sure to put the matter into the hands of the
courts for a final judgment. ``Somebody is going to challenge it
...'' he said. ``Then, for the first time, we will let the Supreme
Court of the United States decide something that we need an answer
to ...''

<HEAD>Prepaid Funeral Plans: Proceed With Caution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rather than leaving the decisions and expenses to
their survivors, increasing numbers of Americans are arranging for
their funerals in advance.
   Funeral directors, insurance companies and other organizations
have responded with a broad array of programs and services to meet
the increased demand.
   Last year, says the American Association of Retired Persons,
sales of ``pre-need'' funeral contracts surpassed 800,000 in this
country.
   The basic idea of planning funeral arrangements ahead of time
makes a lot of sense, the association says in a special report it
has published on the subject. That way, you can make choices in an
orderly way that might otherwise have to be dealt with by others in
haste amid trying emotional circumstances.
   But the AARP urges that you proceed with care before you start
writing checks for a specific package.
   ``Should you pre-plan your funeral? Definitely,'' the association
says. ``AARP recommends everyone pre-plan, but cautions consumers
about prepaying their funerals. There are risks.''
   First of all, it notes, ill-advised commitments can be costly,
with the average cost of a traditional funeral approaching $3,000.
   That outlay covers such items and services as a casket, memorial
services and the use of a funeral home. It typically does not
include other basics such as a burial site, limousines and flowers,
which all together can double the total cost or more.
   Of course any funeral arrangement should first suit your
religious and emotional preferences. However, says the AARP, a
prepaid arrangement should also make sense practically and
financially.
   For example, it says, you may well want to look for a plan that
offers flexibility should you change your mind in the future about
where you want the funeral to be held.
   ``Most, but not all, pre-need plans offer some portability or the
ability to move with you,'' the association points out.
   The longer you expect to live after you sign a contract, it
observes, the more inflation protection you probably will want.
   This protection can take the form of a guarantee from a funeral
director that the services will be provided at no further charge, no
matter what the going rate is at the time.
   Or the money you put up can be invested for you, through a trust
setup or insurance policy that allows it to grow over time. ``There
are some pre-need plans which earn no interest,'' the AARP says.
``Don't waste your money on these.''
   Even supposing that your plan keeps you ahead of future increases
in funeral costs, there is another question to be considered in
advance.
   In cases where more funds build up than are needed to cover
funeral costs, some plans turn the excess over to your survivors,
while others provide for the funeral director to receive it.
   In addition to the financial arrangements, the AARP says, it's
important to shop carefully for the funeral services themselves,
which can vary widely in price and details from one establishment to
another.
   Federal Trade Commission rules require funeral directors to
provide itemized price lists that can be used in comparison-shopping.
   You can also check with government authorities and consumer
agencies to help determine the reputation and reliability of a given
funeral director.
   ``Visit a minimum of two funeral homes,'' the AARP advises.
``It's important to shop around for the best prices on the
merchandise and services you select.
   ``Don't allow anyone to push you into purchasing merchandise you
don't want or can't afford.''

<TEXT>
   Among the more riveting sideshows in
British politics is Edward Heath's war of words with the woman who
took his job.
   The former prime minister has been out of office for 15 years,
but his bitterness toward Margaret Thatcher seems undiminished.
   In Britain, former prime ministers tend to fade away into
lifetime sinecures in the House of Lords.
   Not Ted Heath. From his seat in the House of Commons, he erupts
periodically against the woman he believes has betrayed the
Conservative Party's principles and his dream of European unity.
   Europe is only the latest in a long run of contentious issues.
Heath has attacked Mrs. Thatcher's economics, her foreign policies,
her attitude to the poor. He has called his relationship with her
``a polite nihilism.'' She shrugs and says: ``We all know Ted.''
   They are a study in contrasts: Heath, the consensus man,
flagbearer of the benevolent ``one-nation conservatism'' of the
Victorian prime minister Benjamin Disraeli; Mrs. Thatcher, the
hard-line, free-market radical, a consensus-hater and proud of it.
   She is a round-the-clock political being with few outside
interests; he, in office, was a yachtsman and sometimes symphony
conductor, and still is. Now he has taken up cultivating orchids. An
accomplished pianist, he owns two Steinways and has written books on
music, sailing, travel and Christmas carols.
   At 73, he exudes a fleshy vigor, topped off by a grand mane of
white hair and the famous ear-to-ear smile. He is too partisan to be
regarded as an elder statesman, but on European issues his opinions
command attention.
   It was Heath who brought Britain into the European Economic
Community in 1973, after years of resistance both at home and in the
France of the late Charles de Gaulle. Now the EEC is striving for
greater unity through a single European currency and central bank,
and harmonized social policies, and Heath wholeheartedly supports
the idea.
   His latest broadside against Mrs. Thatcher was triggered by her
claim that the EEC was bent on rolling back her free-market
revolution by forcing socialism upon Britain and engulfing it in
bureaucracy.
   On television he accused Mrs. Thatcher of ``an attempt to mislead
the public.'' Then, in an interview with The Associated Press at his
home on the grounds of Salisbury Cathedral, he amplified:
   ``This is nonsense. ... It can't possibly be true. If the people
of this country elect another Labor government they may get
socialism. A large part of the EEC is not socialist and isn't going
to support socialism now.''
   He said he believed Mrs. Thatcher was confusing ``socialism''
with the ``social order,'' which the EEC wants to bring about by
harmonizing social welfare, and which he says the Conservative Party
has believed in since the mid-1800s.
   For Conservatives, proud of their tradition of party unity, the
squabbling is an embarrassment. But Heath is unrelenting. On radio
and television panels, on the international lecture circuit and in
the House of Commons, where his debating skills always draw a good
crowd, he warns that Britain is in danger of becoming a second-class
member of the European club.
   ``My view of Europe ... is to bring about an ever-increasing
unity inside the Community, a way of life in which you work
together, share each other's benefits and problems and enable people
to have a much higher standard of living than they would otherwise
have, and put the community in a position where it can influence
international affairs.'' Heath says.
   ``If Britain doesn't want to take part, they will be left
outside. The other 11 will go on without us and we shall then become
a second-rate, second tier in the Community.''
   Critics say Heath is still nursing wounds inflicted when he was
dumped as party leader in 1975 in favor of Mrs. Thatcher, the first
woman to lead a political party in Britain. A year earlier he had
lost the third of his four electoral battles against arch-rival
Harold Wilson of the Labor Party.
   ``I think Ted felt desperately and totally betrayed by the
party,'' says Lord Whitelaw, who also lost to Mrs. Thatcher in the
party leadership fight.
   ``This rather shy, rather withdrawn man felt deeply affronted,''
Whitelaw said in a television interview in April. ``Certainly he
would mind more than most people who had been beaten by a woman.
Most men wouldn't like it, but I think he minded more.''
   He added that Heath, a bachelor, had no wife to say, ``What's the
good of feeling so bitter about it?''
   The true extent of Heath's bitterness is likely to be revealed in
his forthcoming memoirs.
   ``I would have thought there would be massive interest in them,
wouldn't you?'' he asked with a tiny smile and the promise: ``I'm
not going to be discreet.''

<HEAD>Methodists Take on Down-Home Songs in Newly Available Hymnal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contrary to church trends toward loftier music,
United Methodists are turning to some foot-tapping gospel songs that
the denomination previously shunned.
   Such hearty spirituals as ``Go Down Moses'' and ``Shall We Gather
at the River'' are additions to the church's new hymnal now being
distributed to congregations nationwide.
   ``It's a serious reformation in United Methodist hymnody,'' says
the Rev. Carlton R. Young of Nashville, Tenn., the hymnbook editor.
``We have made a profound turnaround to give people the songs they
like to sing.''
   Many of them, such as ``In the Garden'' and ``Softly and Tenderly
Jesus is Calling,'' had been excluded from previous denominational
hymnals as too sentimental.
   But they and other popular gospel songs, spurned by musicologists
and generally omitted from formal church repertoires, are in the new
book, along with the longtime classic numbers.
   ``We've still got the highbrow stuff, Bach, Mendelssohn and
Vaughan Williams, everything we had,'' Young said in a telephone
interview. ``But we've expanded it to include that which had not
been included.
   ``Before we've had an elistist hymbook and such musical taste
came at a high premium. Now we've put the premium on that which
people can enjoy and sing readily, alongside the good music.''
   Copies of the new hymnal are rolling out to congregations from
the church's publishing house in Nashville, Tenn., with 3 million
expected to be delivered by September and an additional million by
October, an unprecedented 4 million.
   That's almost one for every two members of the 9 million-member
denomination, the nation's second largest Protestant body.
   Most news stories about the book, which is replacing a 1966
version, have played up changes to make lyrics more sexually
inclusive of people, such as changing ``Good Christian Men,
Rejoice'' to ``Good Christian Friends, Rejoice.''
   Most such alterations are submerged in the texts, such as a
phrase in ``Hark the Herald Angels Sing,'' changed from ``pleased
with man with men to dwell'' to ``pleased with us in flesh to
dwell.''
   Masculine references are almost always retained for God and
Jesus, as in ``Come, thou Almighty King.'' Even the male generic
term for humanity is kept in ``Dear Lord and Father of Mankind.''
   Two hymns portray feminine attributes of God as like a mother
eagle, her broad wings described in one number as checking the fall
of her young as they struggle to fly.
   However, far more dramatic than the broadened gender metaphors is
the book's opening to songs historically excluded from hymnals of
major liturgical churches _ Presbyterian, Episcopal, Lutheran, Roman
Catholic and Methodist.
   Past exclusion of popular gospel songs and spirituals ``has been
our main inadequacy,'' Young said. ``The complaint for the last 50
years is that we didn't have the hymns people wanted to sing.''
   Musicologists spurned such songs, Young observed. ``Only the
people liked them.''But they now occupy a principal place, alongside
traditional hymns. ``I don't think any mainline denomination has had
the turnaround that we've had,'' Young said.
   The newly incorporated songs evolved in America from revivals of
the 19th century and out of the travail of blacks rather than from a
European heritage, which has long dominated most American hymnals.
   ``We were slow'' in accepting the home-grown creations, Young
said. Yet ``they are at the heart and recall of our constitutency.
They're familiar to our people. But they hadn't been in the book.''
   Among the black spirituals included for the first time are
``Swing Low, Sweet Chariot,'' ``It's Me, It's Me, O Lord,'' ``This
Little Light of Mine,'' ``Tis the Old Ship of Zion (Give Me That Old
Time Religion),'' ``I'm Goin' a Sing When the Spirit Says Sing'' and
``Kum Ba Ya, My Lord.''
   Gospel favorites newly added include ``Marching to Zion,''
``Nothing but the Blood,'' ``I Surrender All,'' ``Pass Me Not O
Gentle Savior,'' ``There's Within My Heart a Melody,'' ``Leaning on
the Everlasting Arms'' and ``Lord of the Dance.''
   Altogether, the book's 625 hymns include 84 gospel songs and 38
black spirituals, a total of 122. There also are 17 Spanish hymns,
offered in that language for the first time, 14 Asian and seven
American Indian hymns. Of 300 carry-overs from the old book, 60 are
by founder John Wesley or brother Charles.
   Two martial-style hymns, ``Onward Christian Soldier'' and ``The
Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' at one point were eliminated by the
revision committee, but were reinstated in response to 11,000
protest letters.
   The result of such input, Young said, is a populist instead of
elitist hymnbook compiled under membership influence. ``The
political climate will not sustain anything that does not belong
squarely within the earshot of the average Methodist.''
   Young, 63, professor of church music at Emory University's
Chandler School of Theology in Atlanta who took leave five years ago
to head the hymnal revision, said the book ``fully breathes the
American spirit.''
   He said it may make the church ``a more lively place.''

   Anti-war and anti-abortion activists are
working together in some cases.
   That was so in recent demonstrations at the Seneca Army Depot and
at a Highland Hospital abortion clinic, Religious News Service
reports.
   It said most of the activists at the Army Depot were
anti-abortion protest veterans and most of the protesters at the
abortion clinic were veteran anti-war protesters.
   The Rev. Daniel Berrigan, a Jesuit priest and leading figure in
the anti-war movement, helped coordinate both protests. A
10-foot-long banner proclaimed the linkage this way:``War is
abortion, abortion is war.''
   Organizations combining protests against war and abortion include
Plowshares, which organized the demonstrations in Rochester; an
evangelical group called JustLife; and Pro-Lifers for Survival.

   They wanted to stir up debate, play the
provocateurs, take an idea to its limits. And they certainly did get
people's attention.
   But when Congress completes work on a national service bill,
there is virtually no chance it will include the radical proposal
advanced by Sen. Sam Nunn and Rep. Dave McCurdy to require military
or community service in return for student financial aid.
   Where the two Democrats envisioned a lofty new definition of
citizenship, critics foresaw ``indentured servitude'' for low-income
students.
   Few question the value of public service; senators, in fact, have
jumped onto the bandwagon with a host of alternatives that have
turned out to be more appealing to members than the Nunn-McCurdy
bill itself.
   Objections to the Nunn-McCurdy plan have ranged from President
Bush's stand against any incentives for voluntarism to Pentagon
murmurings that the proposal could undermine the volunteer army.
Perhaps the most widespread concern was expressed by Education
Secretary Lauro Cavazos when he said the plan raises questions about
equity.
   Liberal Rep. William Ford, D-Mich., writing of the bill in The
Chronicle of Higher Education, laid it on the line bluntly: ``It
holds the educational aspirations of the poor hostage to public
service, while excusing the affluent.''
   And conservative Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called it
``incredibly unfair to penalize somebody because of an accident of
birth. Frankly, I don't know what they were thinking of.''
   Nunn, D-Ga., introducing his bill last January, said it was time
to ``awaken a new spirit of citizenship and obligation in America.''
McCurdy, D-Okla., said the idea was to ``appeal to the broad values
of citizenship rather than the narrow views of self-interest.''
   So they proposed that young people spend one to two years in
education, social, conservation or military service; public safety
work; VISTA or the Peace Corps. In return participants would receive
$10,000 to $12,000 a year to be used for college, job training or a
down payment on a home. Service would be required to qualify for
student aid.
   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee is planning to
complete work on a $200 million to $400 million national service
bill before Congress breaks Aug. 4 for its summer recess.
   Aides say it will have many components, including one linking
public service to student aid that stems in part from the
Nunn-McCurdy proposal. However, it will not make student financial
aid contingent on service or in any way dismantle the existing
system of grants and loans.
   The section is expected to combine elements of Nunn-McCurdy with
a part-time, National Guard-type service program proposed by Sens.
Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., and Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
   The option of a part-time commitment would mean participants
would not have to postpone college. In addition, the program would
be purely voluntary since low-income students could get financial
aid without participating.
   In the House, the Education and Labor Committee is expected to
draft a national service bill this fall, against a backdrop of heavy
lobbying by labor unions concerned about volunteers usurping their
turf and education groups opposed to linking service to student aid.
A high-ranking committee aide said members have universally rejected
the Nunn-McCurdy approach and may spurn any plan, even a purely
voluntary one, that links the two.
   Nunn and McCurdy profess to be satisfied at this point with the
impact of their proposal on the Senate. ``Our whole purpose was to
challenge and to be somewhat provocative in our approach,'' McCurdy
said in an interview. ``Plus ours was the only one that dealt with
the military.''
   Nunn's spokesman, Scott Williams, said Nunn never expected to win
acceptance of his sweeping vision on the first try. ``This is only
the beginning of what we see as a long haul,'' he said.
   It could be argued that Bush actually started the national
service debate with his ``thousand points of light'' campaign theme
and a campaign promise of a $100 million volunteer program.
   Last month, with that in mind, Bush announced a Youth Engaged in
Service Foundation, which would receive $25 million a year in
federal money to spur Americans to volunteer for social service.
However, he has not sent any legislation to Capitol Hill _
frustrating the efforts of committee members in both chambers who
would like to see the president's initiative included in the major
national service bill.
   ``As soon as we get something in writing, we'll try to work it
in,'' said a Senate aide who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   But while lawmakers are generally receptive to Bush's ideas, the
feeling is not mutual. ``Service is its own reward,'' Bush told a
group of 3,000 students last month. He has said he does not support
programs that offer stipends or payment subsidies, or use student
aid funds to pay for volunteer service.
   Several components of the expected Senate bill could lead to a
confrontation with the White House _ among them the Pell-Mikulski
section, expansions of VISTA and volunteer programs under the Older
Americans Act, and a full-time youth service corps that would pay
participants or give them education benefits.
   Based on bills introduced by Sens. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., and
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the corps would be open to high
school graduates and dropouts aged 16-25. Participants would work on
public lands or at government agencies, hospitals, schools, nursing
homes, law-enforcement agencies or non-profit service organizations.
   Bush is reported to favor one element of the projected Senate
bill, a student community service plan sponsored by committee
chairman Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. The program would involve
elementary, secondary and college students and out-of-school youth
in tutoring, assisting the elderly, anti-drug abuse efforts, work in
day-care centers, homeless shelters and food banks. Academic credit
could be earned.

<HEAD>World's Pantry Once Again Causing Concerns, Say USDA Analysts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world either has too much food or it
doesn't have enough. Famine is always a crop failure away.
   Right now, say Agriculture Department analysts, concerns are
growing _ as they did a decade ago _ that hunger will march across
the world. But in most of the 1980s there were rising food
stockpiles, depressed prices and worries about farmers producing too
much.
   A team of USDA economists has prepared a collection of papers
about the world food situation and how it seems to be shaping up by
the early part of the 21st century.
   One view, shared by many and described in the USDA report, is
that a large part of the current worry about declining food reserves
stems from decisions by American and European policymakers eager to
reduce costly stockpiles.
   But the global food supply and concerns about it run in cycles,
the analysts said. Despite favorable long-term trends showing growth
in production, the world always seems to be facing a crisis either
of scarcity or of plenty. Policy decisions must be made either way.
   In the last four decades, world food production has more than
doubled, exceeding the rate of population growth. That is a global
statistic, and there are numerous exceptions where famine has been
rampant. The Sahel region of Africa is a current example.
   T. Kelley White of the Agriculture Department's Economic Research
Service noted in his summary of the reports that world grain
production has held close to its long-term trend for a long time. In
other words, grain production has been ``quite stable'' around that
trend.
   ``Also, the margin between too much and too little food is quite
narrow,'' White said. ``In most years, the world's population tends
to consume what is produced. That is, accumulation and drawdown in
global stocks from year to year are relatively minor.''
   Most food is consumed in the country where it is produced. And a
relatively small amount of the world total goes into international
trade.
   For example, White said, grains are the most widely traded group
of commodities, but only 12 percent of world production was exported
and imported in the years 1984 through 1986. Much of the trade is
between net exporting countries to add variety to diets and to
overcome seasonal shortages.
   ``The number of net food-exporting countries is small, and they
tend to be highly developed, high-income, low-population-growth
countries,'' he said. ``The vast majority of the world's population
lives in chronic food-deficit countries.''
   Many of the latter are also poor, underdeveloped and limited in
capacity to use commercial food imports to offset domestic shortages.
   ``The concern about too little food is in reality primarily a
concern about the vulnerability of the poor developing countries
with high rates of population growth, often highly variable domestic
agricultural production and limited means of importing food,'' White
said.
   Why, considering the huge crop surpluses of just a few years ago,
have concerns emerged again about the world's ability to feed itself?
   ``During the last two years, world grain stocks have been drawn
down to what many consider dangerously low levels,'' White said.
``The drawdown has resulted from a combination of policy actions,
primarily by the United States and the EEC (European Economic
Community), to restrict production and move burdensome stocks onto
world markets through efforts to maintain market competitiveness.''
   White continued: ``The effect of these policy actions was
reinforced by the severe drought in North America in 1988 and early
1989 in the United States and Argentina, which significantly reduced
production.''
   But both of these factors _ policy actions and drought _ are
short-term, he said. Neither seems to indicate a long-term change in
the world's ability to produce food.
   ``However, such phenomena do remind the world of the thinness of
the margin between planty and scarcity, and they focus attention on
longer-term trends that could limit growth of food production over
the long haul,'' White said.
   Much is being said about the growing environmental concerns that
plague vast areas of the world, the abuse and degradation of
agricultural land, water and air pollution, and the use of chemicals
that can cause harm.
   World population growth rates have declined, but White said the
population base in low-income developing countries is so large that
growth is still significant. Annually, the global population grows
by about 90 million.
   ``Therefore, the additional food production required just to
maintain per-capita consumption levels will remain high well into
the 21st century,'' he said.
   It is true that the supply of land and water for agricultural
production is limited and, in some cases, being degraded, White
said. But there are technologies available now that offer solutions.
   ``On balance, it appears that in the next two to three decades
the longer-term phenomena that are causing concern do not pose an
insurmountable obstacle to the world food system,'' White said. ``In
this time frame, food crises will likely continue to be localized
and to be the consequence of policy induced inflexibilities in the
world trading system and lack of effective demand, rather than of
the failure of supply.''
   In the longer term, he said, there are threats to the productive
capacity of the world.
   ``However, there is little doubt that there are means by which
such dangers can be avoided, and there is time to implement these
actions,'' White said.

   The Treasury Department has announced a
schedule of maturity dates for U.S. Savings Bonds designed to reduce
confusion among bond holders who are unaware when their bonds stop
earning interest.
   ``Financial institutions and savings bond and note owners will
now only have to recall an easy to remember `40-30-20' formula to
determine how long bonds will earn interest,'' the department said
Tuesday in a statement.
   For instance, it said:
   _``Series E savings bonds issued before December 1965 will stop
earning interest exactly 40 years from their issue dates.
   _``Series E bonds, Series EE bonds and Savings Notes (Freedom
Shares) issued after November 1965 will stop earning interest
exactly 30 years from their issue dates. Outstanding Series H bonds,
issued between 1959 and 1979, also have a 30-year final maturity.
   _``Series HH bonds issued since 1980 will stop earning interest
20 years from their issue dates.''
   In addition to ending bond-holder confusion, the department said
the new formula would reduce its adminstrative costs by reducing
questions from bond owners asking when their bonds will stop earning
interest.
   It said within the next year, as new bonds are printed and
issued, the final maturity will appear on the face of the bonds.

<HEAD>Tribune Co., E.W. Scripps, McClatchy Report 2nd Qtr. Profit Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Higher second quarter profits were reported Tuesday by several
major media companies, with Tribune Co. posting an 18 percent profit
increase over the same period last year, E.W. Scripps Co. reporting
an 8.6 percent gain and McClatchy Newspapers Inc. posting a 31.7
percent rise.
   Chicago-based Tribune Co. reported a profit of $75.3 million, or
95 cents a share, compared with $63.6 million, or 84 cents a share,
in the second quarter of 1988. Revenue during the period rose to
$643.1 million from $613 million.
   E.W. Scripps reported a second-quarter profit of $25.2 million,
or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $320.9 million, compared with
$23.2 million, or 32 cents a share, on revenue of $305.4 million a
year earlier.
   The year-earlier period included a one-time $2.6 million gain
from the Cincinnati-based company's share of the sale of property by
American City Business Journals.
   McClatchy, publisher of the Sacramento Bee, reported net income
of $10 million, or 35 cents a share, in the three months ended June
30 compared with $7.6 million, or 27 cents a share, in second
quarter 1988. Revenue during the period rose to $97.3 million from
$90.2 million.
   Tribune Co., publisher of the Chicago Tribune, New York Daily
News, and several other daily newspapers, credited its results to
partly improved performance by its newspaper publishing and
broadcast divisions. Circulation revenue was unchanged, while retail
advertising revenue increased and newsprint expenses declined.
   The broadcast and entertainment division improved operating
profits by 7 percent, but gains were limited by a $10 million
write-down of broadcast rights, the company said.
   Operating profit dropped nearly 35 percent for newsprint
operations due to a decline in the average selling price of
newsprint and a stronger Canadian dollar.
   For first-half 1989, Tribune Co.'s profits rose to $112.1
million, or $1.44 a share, from $95.8 million, or $1.26 a share, a
year earlier.
   Tribune Co. also owns six independent television stations, five
radio stations and the Chicago Cubs baseball team.
   E.W. Scripps attributed its earnings gain to higher cable and
broadcast results, which helped offset weaker newspaper advertising
and declining comic character licensing revenue. Operating income
was up 12 percent to $18.1 million for broadcasting and more than
doubled to $5.8 million for cable, the company said.
   The company's 80.4 percent-owned Scripps Howard Broadcasting Co.
posted a profit of $7.3 million, or 71 cents a share, on revenue of
79.1 million. That compared with net income of $4.9 million, or 47
cents a share, on revenue of $70.1 million a year earlier.
   E.W. Scripps has 19 daily newspapers and cable systems serving
540,000 subscribers. Through Scripps Broadcasting it operates nine
television stations, five radio stations and cable systems serving
220,000 subscribers.
   For the six months, E.W. Scripps posted a profit of $40.2
million, or 51 cents a share, on revenue of $615.8 million. The
compared with a profit of $34.2 million, or 47 cents a share, on
revenue of $585.5 million in the year-earlier period.
   McClatchy said its performance was helped by improved advertising
linage and circulation at the Bee. Ad revenue rose 7.5 percent and
circulation revenue was up 9.7 percent.
   The company also publishes five other major daily newspapers,
seven community newspapers and a group of senior citizen tabloids,
all in California, Washington and Alaska.
   For the six months, profit rose to $14.8 million, or 52 cents a
share, from $12 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose to $184.2 million from $173 million.

<TEXT>
   DuPont Co. and Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd.
announced they have acquired the pre-press printing business of
Crosfield Electronics Ltd. from De La Rue Co. PLC for $370 million.
   The deal, disclosed Tuesday, is subject to approval by De La Rue
shareholders and government agencies. The agreement was signed in
London.
   De La Rue will retain the Crosfield press controls business.
   ``Crosfield pioneered the electronic pre-press industry and both
DuPont and Fuji are very enthusiastic about joining this proud
tradition of innovation,'' said Clifford H. Schwieter, business
director of DuPont's electronic imaging systems.
   ``We believe that the combination of our worldwide resources in
electronic color pre-press will significantly enhance Crosfield's
ability to deliver the highest value systems and services available
in the market.''
   Mike Ricciuto, DuPont spokesman, said the DuPont and the
Tokyo-based Fuji have not determined what share of Crosfield each
will have.
   ``We haven't really settled on the structure. We will be putting
together the way it will be operated. This is an evolution of our
relationship established last year,'' Ricciuto said.
   Crosfield Electronics was founded in 1947 and acquired by De La
Rue in 1974. It has 3,200 employees and its 1988 revenues were
nearly $400 million. Its principal manufacturing plants are in
Manchester, N.H., Minneapolis, and Boston, and Peterborough, Hemel
Hampstead and Milton Keynes, England.
   Crosfield is a world-wide market leader in high-resolution
electronic color systems for the pre-press market. It has an
extensive integrated digital color equipment line.
   DuPont and Fuji are leading suppliers to the graphic arts
industry. In May 1988, DuPont and Fuji formed a joint development
agreement to produce medium-resolution color electronic equipment.

terms of its $70-a-share tender offer.
   Tyson said Tuesday it had agreed to buy all validly tendered
shares, and that those tendered together with what it already owns
would give it about 97 percent of Holly farms' outstanding shares.
   ``Within 30 days we should complete the merger entirely. From
that point, it's just get out and go to work,'' said Bob Justice, a
spokesman for Tyson of Springdale, Ark.
   The $1.4 billion buyout follows a takeover struggle for Holly
Farms that began last October and pitted Tyson against ConAgra Inc.
of Omaha, Neb.
   Tyson is the nation's largest poultry processor while Holly Farms
is a diversified company heavily involved in fresh fryer sales.
   After the merger, which will give Tyson control of 20 percent of
the domestic poultry market, Tyson plans to sell some $500 million
worth of Holly assets, Justice said.
   Tyson's tender offer expired at 2 p.m. EDT, and Justice said a
preliminary count showed that Tyson received tenders for 17.5
million Holly Farms shares.
   With the Holly stock already held by Tyson, the tendered shares
represented 97 percent of Holly Farms outstanding shares, he said.
   During Tyson's takeover advance, Holly Farms attempted twice to
merge with ConAgra. Holly stockholders voted down such a move in
April, and Tyson's $70-a-share offer ended the second attempt last
month.
   ConAgra's last offer involved a cash and stock swap with an
estimated value of $68 a share to Holly stockholders.
   ``We welcome all Holly Farms people to join with us to continue
production of the highest quality food products available in the
market today,'' Tyson president Don Tyson said in a statement.

<TEXT>
   Eljer Industries Inc., the plumbing products
manufacturer spun off this year from Household International Inc.,
says it has received an unsolicited $211.4 million cash buyout offer
from the building products manufacturer Nortek Inc.
   Eljer Chairman Donald C. Clark said he would recommend against
accepting the bid.
   Eljer said Nortek, which already owns about 8 percent of Eljer's
outstanding stock, said it would pay $32.50 per share for the
company, based in the Dallas suburb of Plano. There are about 7.6
million shares of Eljer stock outstanding, including Nortek's
holding.
   ``It will be reviewed by the board in due course,'' Clark said,
adding, ``I believe that a sale of the company within a few months
after it has been spun off from Household International is clearly
premature.''
   Eljer's announcement of the offer Monday sent its stock up $5.50
a share to $34.12{ in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   On Tuesday, Eljer slipped 50 cents a share to $33.62{.
   Eljer, which employs about 4,900 workers, completed its spinoff
from Household Industries in mid-April.
   For the quarter ended April 2, the company reported pro forma
earnings of $1.49 million, or 21 cents per share, on sales of $100.9
million. The company said it expects to earn $1.95 per share for the
full year.
   Eljer is the nation's third-largest marketer of plumbing fixtures
and also manufactures other building products, including heating and
ventilation products for residential and commercial construction,
remodeling and repairs, and do-it-yourself markets.
   Nortek, based in Providence, R.I., is a diversified corporation
involved in manufacturing products for the building, aerospace,
industrial and electrical industries.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. has unveiled
four personal computers made to AT&amp;T specifications by Intel Corp.,
which is substantially replacing Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti &amp; Co. as
the company's PC supplier.
   The computers announced Tuesday are specially designed to be used
in networks and can be purchased with software that allows them to
perform particular networking or communications jobs. They range in
price from $2,995 to $22,225.
   AT&amp;T has an erratic record in the personal computer business. It
is buying just 30,000 PCs from Olivetti this year for sale in the
United States, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday.
   The announcement was widely expected after AT&amp;T's announcement
last week of a personal computer development agreement with Intel,
which is better known for selling bare chips, not whole computers.
   On Saturday AT&amp;T said it planned to swap its 22.2 percent stake
in Olivetti for an 18.6 percent stake in Olivetti's holding company,
Cie. Industriale Riunite. AT&amp;T is barred from selling that stake for
five years without approval of the holding company.

   Ford Motor Co. announced that a two-week
shutdown of its Edison, N.J., assembly plant will began Monday
because of slow subcompact car sales.
   There are about 1,600 hourly employees at the plant, which
produces about 3,000 Escorts a week. Ford said in a statement
Tuesday that the market for subcompacts has declined more this year
than the market at a whole.
   During the past several months, Ford has temporarily shut down
the Edison and Wayne, Mich., plant, which also assembles Escorts,
because of sagging demand for the cars.
   Ward's Automotive Reports said in this week's editions that Ford
dealers had an 86-day supply of Escorts on hand at the current

   Santa Fe Railway says it is eliminating an
estimated 450 non-union jobs in an effort to make the railroad more
competitive.
   Employees affected range from clerical workers to upper level
management in all 12 states where Santa Fe operates, said spokesman
Robert Gehrt.
   ``Nearly all of these reductions are being achieved through a
voluntary severance and early retirement program, although there
will be a limited number of involuntary separations,'' Michael R.
Haverty, company president, said Tuesday in a news release.
   Santa Fe Railway is a wholly owned subsidiary of Santa Fe Pacific
Corp. It operates approximately 11,500 miles of mainline freight
trackage linking Chicago with 11 other states, mostly in the
Southwest.
   The railroad's total employment stood at 19,633 at the beginning
of the year, and with Tuesday's announced cuts and other actions,
the company said it expects a reduction to less than 18,000 by the
year's end.
   More than half of those cuts have already been made, Gehrt said,
and spokeswoman Susan Metcalf added that some of the remaining jobs
to be eliminated involve normal attrition and retirement.
   ``In order to survive and prosper in today's transportation
environment, it is necessary that we provide high quality service at
competitive prices. We must reduce our ongoing expenses if we are to
accomplish that,'' Haverty said.

<HEAD>Commerce Determines Canada Subsidizes Some Pork Exports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Commerce Department has ruled that imports
of unprocessed fresh, chilled and frozen pork from Canada are being
subsidized by about 3 cents per pound, a ruling that could mean new
duties of the same amount.
   The department's determination, announced Tuesday, now goes to
the International Trade Commission, which has 45 days to decide
whether the imports injure the U.S. pork industry.
   If the commission agrees with the Commerce finding, the
department will order the Bureau of Customs to collect
countervailing duties on the imports to offset the subsidies.
   Canadian pork imports that would be subject to such duties were
about $341 million last year.
   The department's investigation was triggered by a January
complaint from the National Pork Producers Council, the National
Pork Council Women, ConAgra Red Meats Inc., Dakota Pork Industries
Inc., Farmstead Foods, IBP Inc., Illinois Pork Corp., Thorn Apple
Valley and Wilson Foods Inc.
   The department said its investigation did not include processed
or preserved pork products such as canned hams, cured bacon,
sausage, ground pork or live swine. It noted it had found imports of
live swine to be subsidized in a 1985 investigation.
   The Canadian Embassy said it would use the dispute resolution
procedures of the new U.S.-Canadian free trade agreement to press
its view that the department is wrong.
   The Embassy said U.S. law is wrong under international trade
rules to count as a subsidy income-stabilization arrangements
designed to smooth out fluctuations in farmers' incomes. Also, U.S.
law should not automatically assume that any benefits from such
plans are fully passed through to the pork processor, the Embassy
said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel's Corp. 25 percent drop in its
second-quarter profit was another sign that the semiconductor
industry faces a significant downturn, according to some industry
analysts.
   ``The slowdown is now a reality,'' said Michael Boss, an analyst
with Dataquest Inc. of San Jose. ``We saw the seeds of it in the
first quarter, but it's taking a little longer to play out in terms
of revenue.''
   Boss said his company predicted the downturn last year and
doesn't expect an end until the second quarter of 1990. Many
semiconductor companies will experience negative growth through the
next two quarters, he said.
   Intel on Tuesday reported its second-quarter earnings fell to $99
million, or 53 cents a share, from $130 million, or 73 cents a
share, in the same period last year. Revenue rose 3 percent to $747
million. Intel's stock finished the day down $2.50 at $28.87{.
   The company's report followed an earnings and sales decline
reported by Advanced Micro Devices of Sunnyvale last week and
indications by a key industry economic gauge that orders may be
gradually slowing.
   Second-quarter earnings by AMD fell by more than half while sales
fell 11 percent. Jerry Sanders, AMD's chief executive, predicted
revenues will remain flat for the rest of the year.
   While the industry's ``book-to-bill'' ratio released last week
for the month of June reached an all-time high, the order rate
suggested the industry may slow down gradually later this year. The
ratio measures orders vs. shipments.
   June's 1.6 percent increase in orders was below the average 3.1
percent increase over the past 10 years, according to Thomas
Thornhill, an analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in San
Francisco.
   Some analysts think the apparent slowdown will be short-lived,
and is likely a strong seasonal drop.
   Analyst Mel Phelps with Hambrecht &amp; Quist in San Francisco said
Intel's earning were partially hurt by a $17 million charge due to a
planned factory shutdown, and without it, earnings per share would
have climbed another 7 cents, he said.
   The company took the charge to cover costs associated with the
1990 planned shutdown of a wafer fabrication plant in Livermore. The
company is attempting to transfer the plant's 400 workers to other
locations.
   Phelps anticipates strong Intel sales through the end of the
year, partially because of the introduction of new microproccessor
products, and total revenues of $3.1 billion, compared with $2.8
billion last year.
   Analyst Michael Stark of Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co. in San
Francisco said Intel's report was the sign of at least a summer
slowdown. He expects it to be short-lived, and for sales to continue
strong growth through the rest of the year, although not by as much
as he would like.
   ``It's raised a flag of caution in some people's minds; We really
don't think it's more .... but it's clearly the full brunt of a
seasonal weakening,'' he said.
   But analyst Rick Whittington of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York
said the industry was heading into a ``quasi-recession or even an
absolute recession.''
   Whittington, who has been advising clients to sell Intel stock
for the last six weeks, said Intel's introduction of the new
microproccesors ``strategically makes sense, but they run the risk
in the short term of experiencing a classic downturn and as they
shift gears they could be blasted away with margins really sharply.''
   Intel said new orders received for advanced microprocessors were
strong, continuing a recovery from an inventory correction that
occurred in the fourth quarter of 1988. Second-quarter orders also
were higher than those in the first.
   Dataquest's Boss said that because of the relative strength of
the year's first two quarters, the worldwide and North American
semiconductor markets will end the year with about 15 percent
growth, compared with 34 percent in 1988. Next year should see flat
growth, he said.

   The head of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission says it is too soon to impose restrictions on dual
trading, the system in which brokers can trade for themselves and
their customers at the same time.
   At a hearing Tuesday on legislation that would reauthorize the
15-year-old agency, CFTC Chairwoman Wendy Gramm said it was
conducting a study on dual trading that is to be completed in
October.
   ``Since our analysis is not yet complete, we believe that a
statutory restriction based on specific volume levels would be
premature,'' she told exasperated members of the House Subcommittee
on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development.
   In dual trading, floor brokers at a futures exchange may trade
for their own accounts and that of their customers, a practice that
critics claim creates a conflict of interest.
   The reauthorizing legislation, sponsored by subcommittee chairman
Glenn English, D-Okla., and Rep. E. Thomas Coleman of Missouri, the
ranking Republican, would place sharp restrictions on dual trading
in the futures markets.
   English's subcommittee began an investigation of dual trading in
response to revelations in January of an undercover FBI probe of
alleged abuses by as many as 100 traders at the Chicago Board of
Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the nation's two largest
futures markets.
   The proposed legislation would bar dual trading except for
futures that have an average daily trading volume of fewer than
7,000 contracts.
   The legislation also would require exchanges to adopt procedures
allowing them to reconstruct the times of trades to the nearest
30-second interval. An accurate reconstruction of the brokers, terms
and time of a trade _ known as an audit trail _ allows investigators
to determine whether brokers are abusing dual trading rules.
   Because no system can detect every type of trade violation, said
Ms. Gramm, ``We believe that a careful analysis is necessary before
increasing the trade timing standard to 30 seconds or less.''
   English, however, noted that the CFTC conducted 14 studies on
audit trails in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.
   ``They've just about studied everything to death,'' said the
chairman. ``It's time that you act.''
   On other topics, Ms. Gramm told subcommittee members that her
agency had little more than a consulting role in last week's
emergency action on soybean futures in Chicago.
   Ms. Gramm said her agency was now reviewing the emergency order
by the Chicago Board of Trade for soybean traders to liquidate large
holdings.
   While CBOT officials consulted her agency before issuing the
order, Ms. Gramm indicated little other action was taken by the
CFTC, which regulates futures and commodity options markets.
   Rep. David R. Nagle, D-Iowa, asked Ms. Gramm what she did after
CBOT officials notified her that they were ordering all traders to
reduce their July contract soybean holdings to 1 million bushels by
the close of trading Thursday.
   ``I thanked them for the information,'' said Ms. Gramm, adding
that she neither approved nor discouraged the action. Under repeated
questioning by subcommittee members, however, Ms. Gramm conceded
that no opposition was a form of approval.
   ``I don't find your answers very confidence-inspiring,'' said
Nagle.
   Ms. Gramm maintained that under law, the CBOT and other exchanges
are self-regulatory and bear the first responsibility to maintain
orderly trading in and liquidation of futures contracts.
   Several subcommittee members criticized the CFTC for a
``business-as-usual type of approach'' after Ms. Gramm said no major
legislative changes were being sought despite ongoing probes at
commodities exchanges in Chicago and New York as well as the soybean
affair at the CBOT.
   English said during a break in the hearing that he was ``dismayed
by the attitude'' of the agency's officials.
   ``The CFTC has a great deal of authority but they don't seem
willing to use it,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   The Alar controversy has spread to the
cherry crop, with South Korea and Taiwan virtually halting imports
of Washington cherries even though cherry industry officials say the
chemical was not used on the 1989 crop.
   Several large containers of Washington cherries are reportedly
stalled in a South Korean port while the South Korean government
decides whether to admit them, officials said Tuesday.
   There has been no government action against cherry imports in
Taiwan, but consumer fears have destroyed the market there,
officials said.
   South Korea and Taiwan are small markets for Washington, which
produces about one-third of the nation's cherries, but they had been
doubling their cherry purchases for the past few years.
   ``It means loss of a growing market overseas for Washington
cherries,'' said Brent Heinemann, a trade specialist for the
Washington state Department of Agriculture.
   Heinemann said at least two 1,700-box containers of Washington
cherries are sitting at the port of Inchon, South Korea, and hadn't
cleared customs as of last week.
   ``They may not be sold,'' said Heinemann, who was on a trade
mission to South Korea last week and saw Washington cherries
disappear from markets the day after the controversy began.
   Ted Zacher, president of the Chief Wenatchee fruit packing
cooperative in Wenatchee, said all air freight shipments of cherries
to South Korea have stopped.
   ``We don't use Alar on cherries,'' Zacher said. ``Where they got
that information I don't know.''
   The Washington cherry industry has scrambled to produce test
results showing that Alar is no longer used on their crop, but the
test results have not been believed or reported in South Korea,
Heinemann said.
   The Taiwanese Council of Agriculture should move to reassure
consumers that U.S. cherries are safe, said Bill Bryant of the
Northwest Horticultural Council in Yakima.
   In a letter to the U.S. Department of Agriculture last week,
Bryant said that a test commissioned by the fruit industry trade
group found no traces of Alar in 10 Washington cherry samples.
   ``Alar residues should not be an issue with cherries,'' the
letter said.
   Washington growers had hoped to ship 100,000 20-pound boxes of
cherries to Taiwan and South Korea this year, worth about $2 million
wholesale, Bryant said.
   ``This year we'll be fortunate to ship 30,000 boxes,'' Bryant
said.
   Even that would be a huge jump from the 7,400 boxes shipped to
the two countries last year.
   Alar, the marketing name for daminozide, leaped into the
international picture in late February when a consumer group, the
Natural Resources Defense Council, alleged in a report that eating
apples treated with the growth regulator increased cancer risk in
children.
   Alar helps make apples red and keep them crisp.
   Although the federal government pronounced apples safe to eat,
the resulting consumer uproar hurt domestic and international apple
sales and caused severe economic damage to apple growers. Sales
dropped so sharply the federal government recently agreed to step in
and purchase $15 million worth of apples to help growers.
   Washington produces about half the nation's apples.
   Taiwan, one of Washington's largest apple markets, dropped its
apple imports dramatically as a result of the Alar report.
   The cherry scare is an outgrowth of a recent South Korean boycott
of Florida grapefruit after a consumer group in South Korea
contended that a government study reported Alar in some grapefruit.
   But no one seems sure how a link was made to cherries.
   ``A few years ago Alar was used on some cherries but there is no
Alar on the 1989 crop and Alar has never been used on grapefruit to
my knowledge,'' said Bryant.
   Industry officials speculate that the Alar rumors were started by
agriculture interests in the two countries who are afraid of foreign
competition.
   ``Domestic farmers in both countries are looking for any way to
keep (foreign) agriculture products out of their markets,'' Bryant
said.
   Washington produced about 5.5 million boxes of cherries this
year, worth about $100 million. There are about three weeks left in
the current season.

<HEAD>First Of Two BOT Deadlines for Soybean Liquidation Passes Quietly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade's emergency directive
to defuse what may have been a developing corner on the soybean
market apparently achieved its first goal uneventfully.
   Tuesday was the deadline for traders to reduce their holdings of
July contracts to 3 million bushels, and prices closed at the end of
the day showing no signs of shock.
   Prices settled 9\ cents lower to 18 cents higher. The July
contract, which settled at $6.96{ a bushel, and the August delivery
were the only two to close higher.
   A second deadline under the emergency order, believed aimed at a
large soybean position of the Italian agribusiness giant Ferruzzi
Spa, comes Thursday, when traders will have to reduce their July
holdings to no more than 1 million bushels.
   Meanwhile, the Soviet Union and China issued letters suggesting
the emergency order interferes with the free markets used by world
soybean suppliers.
   ``Such an action,'' the Soviet letter said, ``if not very well
economically and legally justified, undermines the basic principle
of commodity futures trading as a hedging mechanism for our sellers
of U.S. grain.''
   In Washington Tuesday, Wendy Gramm, chairman of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, said her agency has taken no stand on
the Board of Trade action, but will try to determine if it was
justified.
   Financial analysts, meanwhile, presented their theories about the
mixed price reaction in soybean trading Tuesday.
   ``Supply tightness aside, there are two reasons the closing
prices were interesting,'' said a trader who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   ``The first is that the volume in July beans was very thin
because nobody wants to get involved. That might explain the healthy
price climb there.
   ``As for August, Ferruzzi may simply have rolled their July
contracts into the next month,'' he said.
   Ferruzzi, which failed in court last week to block the BOT order,
has denied rumors that it attempted to illegally corner the market.
   Ferruzzi has said it accumulated contracts for delivery of as
much as 24 million bushels of soybeans _ when only about half that
many soybeans actually were available for sellers to honor
commitments _ to meet export business commitments and ensure a
steady flow of product for its processing plants.
   This line of reasoning was disputed by the American grain
merchant Cargill, which issued a statement Tuesday on the issue.
   ``While a major market participant has said that its long July
soybean futures position was to cover its processing and export
commitments,'' it said, ``those commitments could have been covered
easily and at lower cost in cash markets.''
   Cargill also denied rumors that it asked the Board of Trade to
limit the July soybean holdings, and said its own position in that
delivery was ``insignificant.''

   Although steel imports increased to 1.47
million tons in May, up 10 percent from April, they remained well
below the level of a year earlier, according to an industry
association.
   Imports for the first five months of the year were down
dramatically, the American Iron and Steel Institute of Washington,
D.C., said Tuesday.
   Import tonnage for the first five months totaled 7.15 million
tons, down 21 percent from January through May 1988, the institute
said.
   Foreign steel represented 17.1 percent of the market in the first
five months of this year, down from 20.7 percent in the 1988 period.
   The May tonnage represented 17.2 percent of the apparent supply
in the U.S. market, compared with 16.4 percent in April and 21.5
percent in May 1988.
   Excluding 873,000 tons of foreign steel ordered by U.S. producers
for processing on their own mills, the five-month tonnage totaled
less than 6.3 million tons, or 15 percent of apparent consumption,
according to the New York-based American Institute for Imported
Steel.
   The goal of the Voluntary Restraint Agreements in place through
September is to limit imports to 18.5 percent of the market, not
counting semi-finished steel bound for U.S. mills.

   The EEC Commission Wednesday said that
Great Britain will raise its limit on foreign shareholders in
Rolls-Royce PLC to 29.5 percent from 15 percent.
   The move followed talks with the British government, challenged
by the commission over the 15 percent ceiling.
   The new limit will be valid until the end of 1992, a shorter
period than the five years requested by Britain, according to Claus
Ehlermann, a commission spokesman.
   Rolls-Royce, a British aero-engine group, was privatized in 1987.
   The commission challenged the British ceiling earlier this year,
saying that the measure breached European Economic Community rules
which outlaw restrictions on foreign investments except where
national security is at stake.
   The British government argued that it imposed the restrictions
because Rolls-Royce was involved in military production.
   The commission's inquiry into the Rolls-Royce share ceiling was
triggered by West German and Belgian investors who complained they
had been forced to sell Rolls-Royce shares at a loss.
   Separately, a commission official, who asked not to be named,
said that the EEC was still examining a similar 15 percent limit on
foreign share holdings in British Aerospace PLC, a British weapons
and aircraft manufacturer.
   The British government imposed the limit in 1985 when it sold its
remaining shares in British Aerospace. But the government retained a
golden share which makes the company effectively bid proof.
   The spokesman would not say whether a similar arrangement to that
concerning Rolls-Royce would be worked out for British Aerospace.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that
thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging
railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest
threatens his economic reforms.
   Strikes have shut down more than 200 mines and factories in the
country's two top coal-producing regions, official reports said. In
a report to the Supreme Soviet, Gorbachev said they have resulted in
a 1 million-ton drop in coal production.
   Following Gorbachev to the podium, legislator Anatoly Saunin said
each lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise help
improve living conditions. ``You mustn't hold a knife to the
throat'' of the government, he told strikers.
   Saunin, from the Donetsk region of the Ukraine, the country's top
coal region, said the number of striking mines there increased from
20 on Tuesday to 58 today.
   ``Now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the
strike as of Aug. 1,'' Gorbachev said during the parliamentary
session, which was broadcast on television and radio.
   ``Such a development of events poses a threat to the
implementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika,'' he
said, referring to his efforts to restructure the economy.
   Miners began walking out July 11 in Siberia's Kuznetsk Basin coal
region. Workers in other industries in the region soon followed. On
Saturday, miners in the Donetsk coal basin began walking off the job.
   The miners are demanding more local control over their industry
as well as higher wages and better living conditions.
   Gorbachev said he and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov sent a telegram
to miners in the Ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted
to Siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well.
   He blamed some of the miners' discontent on ``anti-socialist''
elements but said he understood their basic demands.
   Government negotiations with strike committees have resolved most
of the miners' demands, including those on pensions and overtime,
but some longer-term questions will take up to a month to settle,
and the miners are refusing any delay, he said.
   Central authorities have so far balked at granting miners more
control over their industry.
   If the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy, ``We may
have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what we've been
doing,'' Gorbachev said, without specifying what steps he would take.
   He said the lost coal production could not be recovered by
increasing the mines' output because they already work at full
capacity.
   Recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the
Donetsk and Kuznetsk regions at more than 112,000, but the number
appeared to be rising.
   Because of disrupted coal deliveries, the strike threatened ``a
catastrophe'' at metallurgical and electrical power plants, Tass
said.
   The Politburo sent to Kuznetsk Nikolai N. Slyunkov, a member of
the ruling Communist Party body who worked several years in the
tractor-building industry and has spoken about labor discipline.
   He held marathon meetings with strikers Monday night and Tuesday
and addressed 30,000 people in the main square of Prokopyevsk, 2,100
miles east of Moscow.
   Miners in the Donetsk Basin are demanding a 40 percent wage
increase for night work, improved living conditions, a fixed day off
and retirement after 20 years of underground work.
   They also demand that the Coal Mining Ministry trim its
managerial staff.
   Tass carried a report Tuesday denying that the Soviet Union's
third major coal region, Karaganda in Kazakhstan, also was on strike.
   A proposed law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts is
being rushed through the Supreme Soviet legislature, Tass said.
   A spokesman for the strike committee in Prokopyevsk, Valery
Legachev, said Tuesday that Slyunkov ``promised to increase the
area's regular food supplies by 20 to 30 percent, as well as soap
and washing powder.''
   Izvestia, the government newspaper, reported Tuesday that
Slyunkov promised higher pay for night work, longer vacations and a
doubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits.
   The strikes are believed to be the nation's worst since the
1920s, when the country was gripped in revolution, civil war and a
power struggle. Records from that period are sketchy, but fighting
was widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted.
   Until Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the official media did not
report job actions in the Soviet Union. Underground reports
described strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread as
those in Kuznetsk and Donetsk.

<HEAD>Kann to President and COO Job; Dunn Retiring Early in 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter R. Kann, publisher and editorial director
of the Wall Street Journal, has been elected to the additional posts
of president and chief operating officer of Dow Jones &amp; Co., the
business newspaper's parent company.
   Kann takes over the president's post from Warren H. Phillips, who
remains chairman and chief executive officer, Phillips said in a
news release Tuesday.
   Phillips also announced that William L. Dunn, 53, publisher of
Dow Jones' Information Services Group, has been appointed chairman
of that group and will concentrate on long-range projects. Dunn will
continue as an executive vice president of Dow Jones.
   Dunn, who joined Dow Jones in 1961 as a production assistant in
the Journal's Chicago printing plant, plans to retire in January,
1991, when he will be 55, Phillips said.
   Dow Jones spokesman Danforth W. Austin today said Dunn's decision
to leave the company in 1991 was based on personal reasons but he
would not specify.
   In the news release, Phillips said he was ``saddened'' by Dunn's
decision to retire in 1991, noting that Dunn has made ``incalculable
contributions to the growth of the company's electronic publishing
activities and also to the Journal.''
   Kann and Dunn widely had been considered the top contenders to
succeed Phillips.
   Carl M. Valenti, president of the Information Services Group, has
been given the additional post of publisher of that group, taking
over for Dunn.
   The company did not explain the reason for the management
changes. Phillips had been working without a No. 2 executive
following the retirement of president and chief operating officer
Ray Shaw earlier this year. Phillips had taken the president's job
and left the chief operating officer post unfilled.
   He said in the news release that Kann, 46, had ``proven himself
over many years as an executive of exceptional talent, breadth and
judgment.''
   Kann joined Dow Jones in 1964 as a reporter in the Journal's
Pittsburgh bureau. He went on to become the newspaper's reporter in
Vietnam and its Hong Kong correspondent. He won a Pulitzer Prize in
1972 for his 1971 coverage of the India-Pakistan war.
   Kann later served as the first publisher and editor of the Asian
Wall Street Journal. He returned to New York in 1979 and has held a
range of senior posts in Dow Jones.
   Dow Jones, based in New York, is a leading financial publications
and information concern. Its best-known product is the Journal, the
nation's largest daily newspaper with circulation of nearly 2
million.

   Housing construction, reflecting lower interest
rates, rebounded 7.0 percent in June after falling for four straight
months and reaching the lowest level in May since 1982, the
government said today.
   Fixed mortgage rates, which peaked at 11.22 percent in March
before falling to 10.07 percent by the end of June, had been blamed
for the recent decline in housing activity.
   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartments in
June were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.40 million
units, up from 1.31 million units in May when construction fell 2.5
percent.
   June's increase was the highest since an 8.6 percent hike to 1.51
million units in February 1988. It reflected a 28.0 percent increase
in apartment construction, the highest since a 43 percent increase
in April 1988.
   May's overall drop had been the fourth consecutive one, adding up
to the longest string of declines since activity slowed for five
months in a row from February through June 1987. The May level was
the slowest pace since the 1.30 million rate in December 1982.
   The housing industry had been among the sectors of the economy
hardest hit as interest rates edged upward over the past year with
the Federal Reserve seeking to restrain economic growth to contain
inflation.
   Analysts said the decline in mortgage rates had come too late to
help the housing industry in May, but thought activity would pick up
as rates continued to fall.
   Construction of single-family homes fell 2.0 percent in June to
an annual rate of 975,000 units, the lowest level since August 1984
when 967,000 units were recorded. They fell 5.1 percent in May and
4.7 percent in April.
   But apartment construction rose last month to an annual rate of
425,000 units. Construction of multi-family units had risen 2.6
percent in May after falling 26.6 percent in April.
   By region, overall housing construction decreased last month by
5.0 percent in the Northeast, where starts fell to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 171,000 units.
   The Midwest also recorded a drop, down 3.3 percent to 238,000
units.
   The West, on the other hand, posted a huge 21.4 percent increase
to 443,000 units. Starts in the South were up 5.8 percent to 548,000
units.
   Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing
activity, were down 3.5 percent, however, following a 1.0 percent
increase in May and an 8.5 percent hike in April. They had fallen
the three previous months.

percent June increase.
   Though the latest figure came as no dramatic surprise, analysts
said, it bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further.
   The news helped push interest rates lower in the government
securities market today.

   Eastern Airlines will have to wait another day
before a federal bankruptcy judge rules on its request to release
$100 million from the company's creditors to finance a planned
August expansion.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland in New York adjourned until
Thursday to give the company more time to negotiate with its
creditors' committee, which asked the judge Tuesday to give Eastern
only $40 million to ease its cash crunch.
   Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
five days after it was hit March 4 with a massive strike, has told
its creditors it needs the entire $100 million, and half of it
immediately.
   Meanwhile, Eastern Chairman Frank Lorenzo and President Phil
Bakes scheduled a news conference in Atlanta today. No details were
released late Tuesday.
   Pilots union spokesman Hank Weber said negotiations were
continuing with the company.
   ``They're still negotiating,'' Weber said, denying published
reports that the two sides were at an impasse. ``I don't know who's
throwing out this stuff.''
   Company spokesman Robin Matell said he couldn't comment on
negotiations.
   But while Eastern proposed to guarantee 2,300 pilot jobs, up from
an original guarantee of 1,700, the union sought guarantees for
2,400. The union also would not agree to work-rule and other
concessions in the amount sought by Eastern, the newspaper reported
today.
   Eastern claims it can rebuild without the unions into a smaller,
efficient carrier. It more than doubled its daily schedule to 220
flights this month, and had promised to fly 390 by Aug. 1.
   However, the request for release of funds by the creditors stated
Eastern plans to fly 330 flights daily in August. Company officials
said the figure used by their attorneys in New York was inaccurate,
but they also acknowledged some cancellations may be necessary.
   A company spokeswoman said Tuesday that Eastern will announce by
early next week which, if any, flights will be canceled.
   Documents obtained by the pilots union and information from
travel agents indicated Eastern's major problems are in Atlanta, the
focus of its rebuilding plan.
   Eastern is no longer selling tickets on nearly 50 flight legs in
and out of Atlanta, including to Cleveland, Ohio, and between
several smaller cities in Alabama and Florida and other southern
points.
   ``There are some flights proposed that they can't meet the
schedule,'' said Sal DePace, co-owner of Golden Jet Travel Inc. in
Atlanta. ``I don't know whether it's because of pilots, because of
airplanes or why.''
   DePace, chairman of the National Association of Retail Travel
Agents, said he talked to Eastern management officials on Tuesday
and was told there would be a temporary reduction in flights to some
smaller cities.
   ``It's not going to be a permanent situation as I understand
it,'' he said.
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said no flights have been
canceled, but Eastern is trying ``to minimize passenger
inconvenience, so we are not taking new bookings.''
   ``You have to look at where you're going to impact the most
customers, and how your crew capability and planes match up,'' Ms.
Ceremsak said.
   ``In virtually all the markets involved there are other Eastern
flights,'' she said. Eastern will announce any cancellations within
a week, so that passengers will have plenty of time to adjust, she
said.
   Fewer than 300 of Eastern's 3,800 union pilots have come back to
work since the March 4 walkout by the Machinists, pilots and flight
attendants crippled the carrier that had been flying nearly 1,100
flights daily.

<HEAD>Japanese Firm Buys Dana Point Resort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DANA POINT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's largest maker of kimonos has
purchased the 350-room Dana Point Resort hotel for more than $100
million, one of the largest real estate deals in Southern California
this year.
   Japanese garment giant Masuiwaya bought the hotel overlooking the
ocean from Edward and Thomas Slatkin of the Edward Thomas Companies.
   The Slatkins had bought the hotel and resort, which occupies 11.6
acres, for a reported $65 million from the Southmark Pacific Corp.
of Pasadena 17 months ago.
   Analysts said Masuiwaya, which also owns the Colonial Inn in La
Jolla and the Cliffs in Northern California, may be getting in on
the start of a booming resort area.
   Edward Thomas Companies said the sale to Masuiwaya's investment
arm, Tokyo Masuiwaya California Corp., was completed Tuesday. The
new owner retained the hotel's current management, the Slatkin
brothers told the Los Angeles Times.
   Edward Thomas Companies was represented by Goldman Sachs and Co.,
while Tokyo Masuiwaya California Corp. was represented by Yasuda
Trust and Banking Co.
   Despite the huge appreciation that the Dana Point Resort sale
represents, the price was not out of line for a coastal resort,
industry analysts said.
   ``If you look at recent hotel sales in Southern California, like
La Costa Resort in San Diego County that sold for $250 million and
Hotel Bel Air for $110 million, it is in keeping with what is
happening,'' said Jim Burba, a partner in the Costa Mesa office of
Pannell Kerr Forster, an accounting firm.
   ``Prime hotel property in Southern California is selling at very
high prices in comparison to other parts of the U.S. because this is
perceived to be a strong economy and a strong market,'' Burba said.
   Masuiwaya's purchase appeared tied to Orange County's promise as
a future resort center, said Richard N. Kipper, a partner at
Laventhal &amp; Horwath in Costa Mesa.
   ``The Japanese have to be aware of the plans for several major
high-end resorts on the Orange County coast and are interested in
coming in at the start of the creation of a prime resort
environment,'' Kipper said.
   Local authorities have approved plans to build nine hotels along
the coast between Corona del Mar and Laguna Beach, in Huntington
Beach and in Dana Point.
   Harry Hartnett, a consultant with Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in
Newport Beach, said the deal is a continuation of the Japanese
pattern of acquiring so-called ``trophy'' hotel properties that have
a high visibility and prestige.
   ``They did it first in Hawaii, and now that they have bought most
of the major hotels there, they are turning to California,'' he said.
   In recent years, Japanese investors have acquired the Hotel Bel
Air in Beverly Hills, La Costa Resort Hotel and Spa in Carlsbad and
the Westin chain, which includes the Westin South Coast Plaza in
Costa Mesa and the Westin Bonaventure in Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
   Lakewood Industries, a Hibbing chopsticks
factory that Gov. Rudy Perpich had called a major step in efforts to
revitalize northern Minnesota's Iron Range, has closed.
   Lakewood Forest Products, the plant's parent firm in Canada, said
Tuesday that it closed the factory because of a financial
restructuring. The company said in a press release that it had been
talking with a potential overseas investor, but that discussions
broke off Tuesday.
   Discussions with other potential investors are continuing, but
management ``has determined that in light of the company's working
capital position it is necessary to close the plant until adequate
financing sources have been identified and a financial restructuring
plan implemented,'' the release said.
   The company did not specify what kind of reorganization it is
considering, and officials did not return phone calls.
   The chopsticks plant was restarted with about 20 employees in
March after a three-month shutdown because of equipment problems.
Since it opened three years ago, the plant has had trouble getting
its machinery to produce uniformly acceptable chopsticks, and its
debts have mounted as production has lagged.
   Ian Ward, president of the Canadian firm, said in March that it
was $6 million in debt, including $500,000 owed to the city of
Hibbing, $250,000 to the state and more than $3 million to holders
of development bonds issued by the Iron Range Resources and
Rehabilitation Board.
   The Hibbing plant reported a $3.5 million net loss on $400,000 in
sales last year.
   In April, the Internal Revenue Service filed a lien against the
Hibbing operation for failing to pay $68,000 in federal income and
Social Security taxes it withheld from employees' paychecks in 1987
and 1988.
   The publicly subsidized Hibbing plant has been plagued by
technical production problems since Lakewood opened it in mid-1986
with the goal of producing 7 million pairs of chopsticks daily for
the Japanese market.
   The plant produced just 100 cases for the U.S. market in its
first year of operation and didn't make its first export shipment
until October 1987.
   On its first anniversary, the Hibbing plant was criticized by
Independent-Republican leaders as a government-backed boondoggle
conceived for Perpich's hometown. Perpich was unavailable for
comment on the closing.

<TEXT>
   Inflation slowed in June as consumer prices
rose a modest 0.2 percent, the smallest advance in 16 months, the
government reported today.
   The price moderation reflected the biggest drop in energy prices
in more than two years and the smallest increase in food costs this
year.
   The 0.2 percent June rise in the Consumer Price Index, the
government's primary gauge of inflation at the retail level, was
just one-third the 0.6 percent increase recorded in May.
   Even with the slowdown, prices at the consumer level rose at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.9 percent in the first six
months of 1989, the fastest pace for the first half of a year since
1982.
   But the moderate June advance, the smallest increase since a
similar 0.2 percent rise in February 1988, was certain to be seen as
good news at the Federal Reserve Board, which has been concerned
that the country might be on the verge of another inflationary
spiral.
   Today's report on consumer prices, coupled with news last week
that wholesale prices actually fell in June, provided concrete
evidence that the spurt in prices in the early part of 1989 was
finally beginning to moderate.
   Patrick Jackman, a Labor Department analyst, said price pressures
over the next several months should moderate enough to keep consumer
inflation for all of 1989 down at around 5 percent. Prices rose 4.4
percent in both 1987 and 1988.
   The trouble at the beginning of the year was that energy prices,
driven by the run-up in world petroleum prices, shot up at an annual
rate of 40.3 percent.
   However, energy prices at the consumer level actually fell by 1
percent in June, the biggest decline since a 1.9 percent drop in
October 1986.
   Food costs, which had been climbing at the fastest pace since
1980, moderated as well in June, rising by just 0.2 percent,
reflecting a declining impact from last summer's drought.
   While both food and energy prices moderated in June, other costs
were held in check as well. The Consumer Price Index, excluding food
and energy, rose only 0.2 percent in June, down from a 0.5 percent
advance in May.
   Food prices edged up just 0.2 percent in June, reflecting in
large part a sharp turnaround in fruit and vegetable costs. Prices
of these products declined 1 percent in June after surging 3.2
percent in May.
   Prices also fell for dairy products, beef and pork.
   The 1 percent drop in overall energy costs reflected a 1 percent
drop in gasoline prices at the pump and declines for home heating
oil, natural gas and electricity costs.
   Clothing costs fell 1.1 percent in June, after increasing 2.3
percent in the first five months of the year. The big decline was
credited to larger than usual end-of-season price reductions,
particularly in women's clothing.
   Medical costs rose 0.7 percent in June, the biggest advance for
any of the major categories, with doctors' costs, hospital costs and
prescription drug costs all rising sharply.
   The various changes in June left the overall Consumer Price Index
at 124.1 of its 1982-84 base. That means that a hypothetical
selection of goods costing $100 during the base period would have
cost $124.10 in June.
   In a separate report today, the Labor Department said Americans'
average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, were
unchanged in June after falling 1.4 percent in May.
   Average weekly earnings in June, before adjusting for inflation,
were $332.43, up 3.2 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.2
percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the
12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 1.9 percent.
   With back-to-back good reports showing inflation moderating at
both the wholesale and retail levels, many economists are optimistic
about the price outlook for the rest of the year.
   ``I think we're past the worst (on inflation) and now the
question is the running rate'' of where inflation will settle down,
said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.
   Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting project at
Georgia State University, said he was looking for gasoline prices to
fall for a couple of months and smaller upward pressure on food
costs for the rest of the year.
   ``The surge in inflation from the drought and oil is now over,''
he said.
   But not all economists are convinced inflation pressures are
moderating.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said that
outside the favorable developments in energy and food prices, other
areas were still under price pressures.
   ``The underlying rate of inflation isn't declining at all. If
anything, it is getting a little worse,'' Evans said.
   The Bush administration, in releasing its mid-year update on the
economy, predicted Tuesday that consumer prices would rise by 4.9
percent this year, up only slightly from last year's 4.4 percent
increase.
   ``The administration remains confident of the future course of
the U.S. economy,'' said Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's
Council of Economic Advisers.

   The stock market rallied sharply today, inspired
by better-than-expected news on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 30.53 to 2,575.11
by 11 a.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 960 up, 327 down and
500 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 73.30 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Labor Deartment reported this morning that the consumer price
index rose 0.2 percent in June, down from 0.6 percent the month
before.
   The consensus estimate on Wall Street had called for a 0.3
percent June increase.
   Though the latest figure came as no dramatic surprise, analysts
said, it bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further.
   The news helped push interest rates lower in the government
securities market today. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds, which
move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose more than
$5 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.14
percent-8.16 percent range.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1~ at
56[; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up { at 37; Exxon, up ~ at 46[;
McDonald's, up ~ at 31, and International Business Machines, up { at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.90 to 186.81. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 2.13 at 372.30.

   With two Top 10 movies and a bustling new
studio tour in Florida, The Walt Disney Co. already is having a hot
summer.
   A 7{-minute appearance by Roger Rabbit, the '80s answer to Mickey
Mouse, is helping pack families in for showings of Disney's ``Honey,
I Shrunk the Kids.''
   Robin Williams, whose risque brand of humor probably would have
made the late Walt Disney blush, is pulling a whole different
audience for ``Dead Poets Society.''
   And the Disney-MGM Studios tour outside Orlando puts the
granddaddy of amusement park companies at the forefront of the
latest trend in fun factories by taking customers backstage to play
at movie-making.
   It's the new Disney _ one that repulsed a raid on the Magic
Kingdom of the business world five years ago, revved up a plan to
make movies for older audiences and devised new ways to wring
billions out of a familiar lineup of animated characters and
amusement parks.
   With fine-tuning, that remains the formula for the future, said
Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman and chief executive officer.
   ``To me it's not what next, but what's not next,'' Eisner said in
an interview. ``We have plenty to do with the Disney franchise, with
the Disney attractions, with the Disney image, to keep us occupied
for 20 years. We don't have to go out and prove that size is
better.''
   Fostering the franchise has paid off. Disney's earnings rose 17
percent last year to $522 million on sales of $3.4 billion. In the
first half of this year, earnings totaled $149 million on sales of
$1 billion. (The second half is bigger because of summer park
visitors and movies.)
   The amusement parks _ Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif. and Disney
World in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., _ are Disney's biggest moneymakers,
accounting for more than half its sales and earnings.
   But the big story of the last few years is movies, particularly
the young adult-oriented films produced by Disney's Touchstone
Pictures studio.
   Movies like ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``Cocktail'' and ``Who
Framed Roger Rabbit'' propelled Disney to the top spot in the box
office derby last year for the first time. Disney movies captured
19.4 percent of the nation's ticket sales, ahead of Paramount at
15.2 percent, 20th Century Fox at 11.6 percent and Warner Bros. at
11.2 percent.
   The company's two early entries this summer _ the traditional
Disney family comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and Touchstone's
``Dead Poets Society'' _ have drawn scant media attention, partly
because of the hoopla over blockbusters like ``Batman'' and
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   But both are making enough to put them among the top 10
box-office attractions. ``Honey,'' which is preceded by the Roger
Rabbit cartoon ``Tummy Trouble,'' set a Disney record by collecting
$14.3 million its opening weekend.
   Hollywood is impressed with Disney's shrewd marketing, its move
to sign a stable of young stars like Bette Midler and Tom Cruise,
and an unusual emphasis on containing production costs.
   During the movie and television scriptwriters' strike last year,
union negotiators saw Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg as
their nemesis on the producers' joint negotiating group.
   In TV, the company also is mixing the old with the new. ``Golden
Girls'' and ``Empty Nest'' supplement broadcast staples. The boom in
home video is a boon to Disney with its library of children's
favorites and new features.
   In the fiercely competitive amusement park business, new
attractions are crucial, and Disney's bid for glory this year is the
studio tour in Florida. The $400 million addition to the Magic
Kingdom and Epcot Center includes peeks at working movie studios, a
re-creation of the Hollywood Boulevard in ts 1930s heyday and a
do-it-yourself music video.
   The company declines to release attendance figures for its parks,
but insiders say crowds at the new studio tour in Florida are
running above expectations. The company gets royalties from Tokyo
Disneyland and is lining up funding for a planned park outside Paris.
   Rival MCA Inc., which battles Disneyland for tourist dollars in
Southern California with a tour at its Universal Studios, plans to
open its Florida studio as an attraction next year and is
considering a European park.
   But analysts downplay the competition.
   For one thing, the worldwide demand for fun appears insatiable.
Then there's what has become known as the Disney magic: The
seemingly boundless affection for Mickey, Minnie, Goofy and the rest
of the cartoon gang.
   ``I think Disney owns the Florida vacation franchise and anyone
who thinks they can take that away is not going to be a happy
camper,'' says Jeffrey Logsdon, who follows the company for Crowell
Weedon &amp; Co. in Los Angeles.
   It's been suggested a recession could spoil the fun.
   Even a mild slowdown of the type many economists expect in coming
months inevitably would cut into people's spending on extras _ like
gasoline and the $94 four-day pass to the Florida complex _ says
Harold Vogel, an entertainment industry analyst at Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets in New York.
   Others doubt anything short of an economic disaster would
seriously dampen consumer enthusiasm for parks, movies and TV, both
live and recorded. After all, Hollywood's Golden Age was born during
the Great Depression.
   ``Unfortunately, the rougher it gets, the more people want to
have some exit from their environment,'' says CEO Eisner.
   Amid a wave of hostile takeover attempts at big media companies,
Disney recently tightened its defenses with a ``poison pill'' plan
that would allow present stockholders to buy new stock at half-price
if an unfriendly bid arose.
   But Disney already was considered relatively safe from raiders,
partly because of its experience with a hostile takeover attempt
five years ago. Analysts say it should remain that way as long as
the stock remains strong.
   Nearly 25 percent of the company's stock is owned by those
friendly to management, including 17 percent controlled by Texas
investor Sid Bass and allies, and nearly 3 percent in the hands of
Roy Disney, nephew of the late animator and company founder.
   A current civil trial in Los Angeles County Superior Court
reprises Disney's 1984 takeover battle, which resulted in ejection
of Walt Disney's son-in-law, Ronald Miller, from management and the
entry of Bass as a friendly investor. A shareholder lawsuit against
former management and directors alleges little investors were
wronged when the company bought raider Saul Steinberg's 11 percent
stake for a high price, a practice known as ``greenmail.''
   The Walt Disney Co. isn't a defendant.
   The company built on cartoon characters zealously defends Mickey
and the rest from impostors.
   Among its copyright actions this year: Dispatching lawyers
against three Hallandale, Fla., day-care centers that painted
pictures of Mickey and friends on their walls without permission;
blocking the city of White River, Ontario, from erecting a statue of
Winnie the Pooh; and wresting an apology for an unauthorized Snow
White song-and-dance number on the Academy Awards telecast.

<TEXT>
   Michael Eisner, the executive who hosts
``The Magical World of Disney'' on Sunday night television, says
he's uneasy in his ``Uncle Walt'' role.
   Eisner, who began giving homey introductions to the family
anthology show after he was named chairman and chief executive
officer of The Walt Disney Co., said in an interview it was strictly
a business move.
   ``I'm not wild about the notoriety or the public acceptance or
all that stuff,'' Eisner said. ``But we decided early on that we had
to be a company with a rudder.''
   Eisner, 47, was referring to a management team, including
president and chief operating officer Frank Wells, that was credited
with revitalizing the company after a takeover battle in 1984.
   Part of the magic of the old Disney shows, they felt, was the
introduction by Walt Disney before his death Dec. 15, 1966.
   ``I figured that I had to do it irrespective of my own desires
for privacy _ and my wife's demanding of it _ because I thought it
was part of the job,'' Eisner said.
   Viewers seem to like the spots, but it's a different story with
Eisner's wife, Jane, and children, Michael, Eric and Anders.
   ``I think I'm pretty poor,'' Eisner said. ``I think it's worse
than it is _ though my children will confirm it's as bad as I think
it is.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Rise On Rumored Soviet Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid talk that the
Soviet Union was in the market for corn and soybeans.
   The rally in the corn market reflected a rise in cash prices,
which began climbing late Tuesday afternoon on rumors the Soviets
were pricing U.S. corn, analysts said.
   ``The chances are pretty good that something has been done or at
least inquired on,'' said William Biedermann, a vice president and
director of research for Allendale Inc., a futures brokerage in
Crystal Lake, Ill.
   Talk of a Soviet deal for as much as 200,000 metric tons of South
American soybean meal gave the soybean market a boost.
   The price for July delivery of soybeans whipsawed in early
trading as players tried to squeeze a little more profit out of the
contract before it expires on Thursday. The July soybean contract
has been extremely volatile in the past week, following a Board of
Trade order requiring traders to reduce their positions in that
contract.
   ``It's a no-man's land,'' said one trader, who noted that with
few players in the July contract, its price is subject to sharp
swings.
   Wheat futures were a little higher on perceptions of dry-weather
damage to the spring wheat crop.
   In early trading, wheat was 1{ cents to 4\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.91 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
4} cents higher with July at $2.53 a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5\
cents higher with July at $1.47 a bushel; soybeans were 6{ cents to
52{ cents higher with July at $7.48 a bushel and the more heavily
traded August contract at $6.96 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .33 cent lower to .02 cent higher with August at
72.47 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .30 cent lower
with August at 83.40 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .52
cent higher with July at 47.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .05 cent lower to .50 cent higher with July at 28.77 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Tuesday.

   United Mine Workers and Pittston Co.
officials began federally mediated contract talks today, the first
negotiations in the bitter coal strike in six weeks.
   Outside the closed-door sessions, negotiators blamed each other
for the long stalemate, which has led to wildcat sympathy strikes at
other companies that idled as many as 46,000 miners at various times.
   Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom said it is up to the
union to get talks moving by responding to the company's latest
contract offer.
   ``We have our proposal on the table,'' Odom said on today's ``CBS
This Morning'' news show. ``We feel our proposal recognized the
dynamics of the coal market we operate in ... we feel our proposal
would put people back to work.''
   Before entering the talks, UMW President Richard Trumka
responded: ``I think it was a mistake for Mr. Odom to go on TV this
morning and say how inflexible he is.''
   The parties spent four hours with a judge Tuesday before agreeing
to resume negotiations. Talks had broken down June 8.
   At today's talks, the two sides sat in separate rooms with
federal mediators shuttling messages between them. The 3{-month-old
strike has been marked by occasional violence and triggered wildcat
walkouts by tens of thousands of miners.
   UMW President Richard Trumka, speaking to reporters at a
southwest Virginia motel where the talks began, said the way to
solve the strike would be for Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas to
participate in the negotiations.
   ``I'm disappointed that's not going to happen,'' Trumka said.
   But Michael Odom, president of Pittston's mining subsidiary,
Pittston Coal Group Inc., told reporters the company wouldn't be
pressured into changing its negotiators.
   ``It would be improper for the union to dictate to us or for us
to dictate to the union who represents them at the bargaining
table,'' Odom said.
   About 1,900 UMW miners are striking Pittston for its refusal to
sign a national contract guaranteeing full medical benefits for
pensioners and prohibiting mandatory overtime and Sunday work.
   Pittston miners went on strike in Virginia and West Virginia in
early April after working 14 months without a contract. Workers in
Kentucky walked out in June. Hundreds of miners have been arrested
for a variety of violent incidents and for civil disobedience
tactics, such as blocking coal-hauling roads.
   Wildcat strikes in support of the Pittston workers began last
month and idled up to 46,000 miners in 10 states.
   Most of those miners returned to work this week, but wildcat
strikes continued in parts of West Virginia. Shots were fired
Tuesday at coal trucks in Boone County, W.Va. No injuries were
reported and state police Superintendent J.R. Buckalew said the coal
fields were relatively quiet.
   Union officials in Alabama told more than 3,000 miners to return
for Tuesday night's shift at two companies after they failed to show
up earlier in the day.
   Trumka said the company wants to stop financing pensions for
6,000 Pittston retirees, a move he claimed would lead other
companies to seek to eliminate funds for 130,000 pensioners, widows
and dependents.
   Pittston also refuses to allow 4,000 laid-off employees to
reclaim jobs when they become available, Trumka said.
   ``Do we see it as a frontal assault on the union? Yes, we do,''
he said.
   Odom reiterated the company's contention that it needs contract
changes so it can meet competition from other producers, including
foreign companies.
   ``They're just going to have to recognize changes in the dynamics
of the coal industry,'' Odom said.
   The two sides met Tuesday with U.S. District Judge Glen Williams,
who has been presiding over contempt charges against the union
stemming from its picket line activity at Pittston operations.
   Williams said he was encouraged by the presence at the meeting of
Trumka, UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts, Odom and Pittston Vice
Chairman Joseph Farrell.
   ``To see all this high brass here exceeds my expectations,''
Williams said.
   Trumka said he would have preferred that the union and company
meet face-to-face, but said anything is better than stalemate.
   If the talks fail, Trumka said the union would seek an
independent labor expert to determine which side is refusing to
bargain in good faith.
   Odom said he was not willing to assume the talks would fail. ``We
felt that federal mediation was the appropriate agency for a
different approach,'' he said.

   Nissan Motor Manufacturing USA rolled its
1-millionth vehicle off the assembly line this morning in a
celebration of company unity one week before a union vote to
organize the plant.
   Jerry Benefield, president and chief executive officer of
Nissan's only U.S. factory, declined to predict the outcome of next
week's United Auto Workers organizing vote.
   ``I think our employees will speak for themselves,'' said
Benefield, who wore work clothes in the tradition of managers at the
Japanese auto company. ``It's between the union and our employees.''
   Benefield wore a T-shirt that read, ``1 Team Makes a Million,''
and many in the crowd of employees, managers and Nissan dealers had
buttons that read, ``Keep 1 Team.''
   Benefield drove the milestone white pickup truck off the assembly
line to applause and cheers from the crowd of about 100. No
pro-union activity was visible in or around the plant.
   A white pickup named Job 1 was the first vehicle produced at the
plant when it opened June 16, 1983.
   Nissan has a total of 3,200 employees working two shifts, and an
annual payroll of more than $100 million.
   Initially the plant only built light pickup trucks but added
Sentra passenger cars in March 1985. As of June 30, Nissan had
produced 601,083 trucks and 396,729 Sentras in Smyrna, which lies
about 30 miles southeast of Nashville.
   The company is preparing to add a third vehicle line in 1992,
bringing its total production capacity to 440,000 vehicles per year
and making it the highest volume facility under one roof in the
United States, according to Nissan.
   The factory is one of three nonunion U.S. plants owned by
Japanese automakers.
   Long a target of the United Auto Workers, the 2,400 hourly
workers at Nissan will vote Wednesday and Thursday on union
representation. The UAW has concentrated on worker injuries and
assembly line speeds as major campaign issues.
   It was the non-union environment of Tennessee that contributed to
Nissan's decision to build its highly sought plant here, and Nissan
officials maintain the lack of a union continues to help production
and employment expand.
   ``As we begin the production of our second million vehicles, we
will continue to make it a priority for our company to contribute to
the quality of life in the Middle Tennessee area,'' Benefield said
before today's ceremony.

   Monsanto Co., spurred by strong across-the-board
gains, on Wednesday reported record sales and profits for the second
consecutive quarter.
   Net income for the second quarter ended June 30 was $241 million,
or $3.54 a share, a 10 percent increase over the same period last
year, when earnings were $220 million, or $3.04 a shae.
   Revenue for the quarter was $2.35 billion, up 4 percent from the
$2.26 billion reported in last year's second quarter.
   Richard J. Mahoney, Monsanto chairman and chief executive
officer, said the chemical company benefited from diversification,
combined with favorable market conditions.
   ``Monsanto has repositioned itself into a new category of
company,'' said Mahoney, ``a company with products that are based on
chemistry, but far less affected by traditional chemical industry
cycles. Our product portfolio is now much less sensitive to economic
fluctuations than in the past.''

percent to $463 million, or $6.78 a share, from $430 million, or
$5.90 a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter. Revenue in the first
half rose to $4.6 billion, up 5 percent from $4.4 billion in the
same year-ago period.
   Monsanto's agricultural subsidiary, Monsanto Agricultural Co.,
posted record profits during the quarter largely because of
increased worldwide sales of Roundup and Lasso herbicides.
   In its Animal Sciences division, demand for Alimet animal feed
supplement continued to expand, especially in markets outside the
United States, but competitive pressures held profits in check.
   Monsanto's core chemical business also increased with demand
particularly strong in Europe, although auto-related markets slowed.
   Results at Searle improved dramatically, due in large part to the
ongoing strength of Calan SR antihypertensive drug. In addition,
Mahoney said early results for the U.S. launch of Cytotec antiulcer
drug were encouraging.
   Monsanto's NutraSweet Co. posted a strong quarter, although sales
were somewhat lower than last year's record-setting second quarter.
But the subsidiary set a sales record for the first half of the year.

<HEAD>Smoking Opponents to Push for Ban on all Airline Flights</HEAD>

   Congressional smoking opponents, seeking a ban
on smoking aboard all U.S. airliners, will ask a House panel to
overrule a subcommittee vote keeping only the current ban for
flights under two hours.
   In a series of parliamentary moves aimed at heading off a total
ban, pro-smoking forces won their first victory in the House Public
Works and Transportation aviation subcommittee on Tuesday.
   ``They're probably all out there puffing happily right now,''
said Rep. James Oberstar, subcommittee chairman.
   The subcommittee voted 17-18 against a move to extend the
temporary ban on two-hour flights to cover permanently all flights
up to four hours. Oberstar's bill proposing a total ban was amended
to extend the ban on two-hour flights from April 23, 1990, to April
23, 1992.
   Oberstar, D-Minn., said heavy lobbying by tobacco interests
helped defeat the total ban in the subcommittee.
   The subcommittee also approved two other measures affecting
aviation: a limit on the liability of small plane manufacturers and
a delay in implementing a rule requiring collision avoidance systems
on large airliners.
   The liability and collision measures are to be taken up by the
full committee on Thursday, Oberstar said. The smoking bill also was
scheduled for Thursday but committee spokesman David Smallen said
today Oberstar decided to postpone it for a later meeting.
   The smoking vote was on the first of several measures pending in
Congress that would limit or ban smoking on airliners.
   Other bills and amendments in House committees would make the ban
on flights of under two hours permanent, phase in a ban affecting
flights of up to four hours, or extend the two-hour ban to all
flights with 15-minute-per-hour smoking intervals after the first
two hours.
   A ban on flights under four hours, proposed by Rep. Peter
DeFazio, D-Ore., would have applied to nearly all flights except
those that go nonstop coast-to-coast.
   DeFazio said this would accommodate smokers and give nonsmokers
the option of making one connecting flight on a cross-country trip
to stay on no-smoking flights. Under the present law, it would take
five flights to make a smoke-free flight from San Francisco to New
York, DeFazio said, with stopovers in Salt Lake City, Denver, Omaha
and Chicago.
   He said smokers could get prescriptions for nicotine-laced gum if
they felt a four-hour flight was too long to go without smoking.
   ``Then they could put nicotine into their systems without putting
it into everyone else's,'' DeFazio said.
   The bill changing the requirement for computerized devices that
alert pilots to nearby aircraft would let the Federal Aviation
Administration extend a Dec. 30, 1991, deadline for installation of
the $100,000 units.
   Airlines say they need more time to install the units and to test
the system to see how it works when several airliners are equipped
with them.
   The collision avoidance system includes a screen in the cockpit
which shows the pilot planes in his vicinity and, if necessary,
audibly instructs the pilot to climb or descend to avoid a collision.
   The liability act would decrease risks to manufacturers but would
not cap liability claims. Proponents said that despite increases in
general aviation safety, insurance to cover aircraft accidents has
skyrocketed, forcing manufacturers out of business.

   United Technologies Corp. said Wednesday
its second-quarter earnings were nearly flat compared with last
year's.
   United Technologies reported its second-quarter income edged up
0.5 percent to $197.3 million from $196.2 million in the
corresponding 1988 quarter. Earnings per share held steady at $1.50.
   Revenue grew 17.8 percent to $5.3 billion from $4.5 billion in

   Last year's second quarter results included a one-time pretax
gain of $41.4 million, representing United Technologies' share in

   ``Our second-quarter financial performance reflects better
year-to-year operating results and improved earnings quality,'' said
Robert F. Daniell, United Technologies chairman and chief executive
officer.
   After-tax income for the first six months of 1989 totaled $321
million, or $2.45 a share, up 0.9 percent from $318 million, or
$2.44 a share, in the first half of 1988.
   Revenue in the first half amounted to $9.7 billion, up 10.2
percent from $8.8 billion in the same period last year.
   United Technologies said it had a business backlog on June 30
valued at $17.5 billion.

   Share prices ended at a new post-crash closing high
Wednesday, buoyed by a renewal of takeover speculation and a strong
rally on Wall Street.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index climbed 19.4
points, or 0.9 percent, closing at 2,292.5.
   ``Takeover speculation was rife today,'' one dealer said.
``There's so much liquidity around and fund managers just don't want
to be left out of any potential action.''
   A robust rise on Wall Street also boosted the London market's
confidence. At the London close, the Dow Jones industrial average
showed a 25.23 point gain at 2,569.99.
   Both markets were bolstered by a report on the U.S. Consumer
Price Index, which suggested inflationary pressures have eased. In
June, the CPI increased a modest 0.2 percent, compared with a
0.6-percent jump in May.
   The Financial Times 30-share index closed 19.9 points higher, at
1,903.2. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 10.59 points to

<BYLINE>Spanish Markets Gear Up for ``El Big Bang'' ^By FRANCISCO CONDE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brokerage houses, banks and investors in
Spain are readying themselves for July 29 and ``El Big Bang'' _ the
most sweeping changes in the country's four stock exchanges since
the first was founded in 1831.
   ``Without a doubt, the reform represents a revolution,'' said
Frederik Artesani, 29-year-old head of research at Lombardia y
Lacaci, one of Spain's leading brokerages.
   ``It is the definitive step to bring Spanish financial markets
and practices completely in line with those in the international
financial system.''
   Luis Carlos Crossier, head of the new National Securities
Commission, says he is convinced Spain's Big Bang will be as
important as the one in London that deregulated British financial
markets in October 1986.
   ``Defending the rights of investors is one of the principal goals
of the June 1988 bourse reform law,'' said Crossier, whose agency
will police the markets, like the Securities and Exchange Commission
does in the United States. ``And if we don't achieve this it will
mean the total failure of the reform.''
   The economic boom that followed Spain's January 1986 entry into
the European Economic Community has spurred Socialist Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez to modernize its markets with sophisticated
computers and greatly increased competition.
   The key result of El Big Bang, as it has come to be known, will
be the end of the so-called Latin model exchange, in which
government-appointed brokers monopolize trading and supervise
themselves.
   ``On July 29, we go to the Anglo-Saxon model: the civil servant
brokers disappear and the four stock exchanges _ Madrid, Barcelona,
Bilbao and Valencia _ become interconnected private corporations
owned by member brokerages or dealer companies,'' said Madrid Stock
Exchange spokesman Jaime Sanz.
   The Madrid stock exchange accounts for nearly 70 percent of all
trading done in Spain.
   Stock exchanges in Paris, Milan, Athens and Lisbon are still run
along the lines of the Latin model, which dates to the Napoleonic
era in the early 19th century.
   On July 29, at least 20 percent of the more than 350 companies
now listed in Spain will be quoted on the new Computer Automated
Trading System (CATS) linking the four exchanges. The Toronto Stock
Exchange, a pioneer in the use of automated securities trading, was
the developer of CATS.
   The four Spanish exchanges, once a cacaphonous din of yelling
buyers and sellers, will gradually be phased into the new system,
where the market price of stocks will be determined by people
communicating via computer terminals.
   In anticipation of the big day, most Spanish brokers already have
established their own firms, either alone or in conjunction with big
Spanish banks or foreign banks and brokerage houses.
   The fixed 0.25 percent-per-share commissions earned by current
brokers will also give way to full commission competition among the
48 brokerage firms and the 50 broker-dealers who so far have
registered under the new law.
   The Big Bang reform and the stampede of brokerages and banks to
the market have incited a bidding war for the best people in the
business.
   Brokerage and banking firms are raiding each other, in some cases
shattering long-established trading and management teams.
   Industry sources say a few of the top Spanish professionals have
been lured away by yearly salaries of up to 40 million pesetas or
about $341,000. Three years ago the rate was 5 million pesetas.
   Monica Morales, managing director of Ibercorp, a private bank and
brokerage firm, says ``offers going around are ludicrous.
   ``One brokerage lost 11 people in one day. We've lost one
analyst, one person in corporate finance and two fund managers.''
   Concern has intensified in the industry that competition will
become even more brutal after July 29.
   ``There are too many participants, and I don't think there will
be enough market to go around,'' Morales said.
   ``The market reform is totally necessary and inevitable, but I'm
not terribly happy about it. The problem is that there are so many
things to do in such a short time and many things left hanging.''
   Croissier acknowledges the government has carried out the reform
at a breakneck pace to prepare Spain for further financial reforms
in Europe that will help shape the European Community's single
market restructuring in 1992.
   But he said the reforms will not be completed for another year.
Still to be established is a new code of conduct aimed at banning
insider trading for the first time and creating a new transaction
settlement system to speed up the current archaic one, which takes
weeks.
   The reform replaces a 1967 law and subsequent decrees by the
authoritarian government of Gen. Francisco Franco. His death in 1975
cleared the way for the restoration of a democratic government two
years later.
   ``The old bourse code is quite outdated, and it has been
overwhelmed by the boom in stock market investment and new practices
and methods,'' Croissier said.
   Between 1985 and 1988, the value of securities traded on the
Madrid Stock Exchange nearly tripled, rocketing from 6.3 trillion
pesetas or $52.8 billion to 18 trillion pesetas.
   Spain's booming economy, averaging a 4.5 percent growth rate over
the past three years, has drawn foreign money like a magnet. Direct
foreign investment in Spain went from $1 billion in 1983 to $4
billion last year.
   The Madrid Stock Exchange index ended 1986 with a whopping 53.4
percent increase. In 1987, despite the global stock market crash in
October, the index rose 9.1 percent. Last year it rose 20 percent.

<HEAD>Immigrant Tycoon Sentenced to Five Years for Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Refaat El-Sayed, an immigrant who became
a business tycoon and national hero, was convicted of fraud and
insider trading Wednesday and sentenced to five years in prison.
   El-Sayed, 43, was convicted on 14 counts of swindling investers,
perjury, insider trading and fraud in the biggest white-collar case
brought to a Swedish court.
   The Stockholm District Court also sentenced Gaston Portofaix, the
finance manager of El-Sayed's former company Fermenta AB, to one
year in jail. Portofaix said he would appeal the verdict.
   An immigrant who came from Egypt in 1964, El-Sayed parlayed his
1981 purchase of the failing biotechnical company Fermenta into a
financial empire based on pharmaceuticals.
   Charm and informality in the normally tight-laced Swedish
business world won him public attention. The popular press was
enamored with his tie-less style and his weekend soccer-playing in
the fifth league, as his personal fortune grew to become Sweden's
largest.
   In 1985, El-Sayed's wealth in Fermenta stock alone was estimated
at $1 billion kronor, or about $156 million.
   His business acumen also was admired by a nation emerging from
recession into prosperity. Swedish television voted him Man of the
Year in 1985.
   His success began to unravel the following year when it was
discovered that his claim to have a doctorate degree was phony. The
disclosure led to a closer look at the company's transactions, and
El-Sayed was found to have put misleading information in annual
reports to improve the company's profits.
   He also was charged with selling off Fermenta shares before the
release of a negative report.
   El-Sayed declared bankruptcy in 1987 when Fermenta's shares
became worthless and he was ousted from the company's management.
   The court ruled that El-Sayed had grossly misused his position
and the ``special trust'' as head of Fermenta to mislead the stock
market.
   It said there were no extenuating circumstances, and ruled that
El-Sayed was forbidden from heading a company in Sweden for a
five-year period.
   El-Sayed has been held in jail since May 25, when the court ruled
he might try to flee the country if freed. Swedish prison boards
routinely remit half the sentence.

<HEAD>AMR's Quarterly Earnings Set Fourth Consecutive Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Record traffic on American Airlines in
June pushed parent AMR Corp.'s quarterly profit to $177.9 million, a
25.8 percent increase over last year's second quarter, the company
said Wednesday.
   The Fort Worth-based company said earnings were $2.83 per share,
on total operating revenue of $2.72 billion. In the quarter ended
June 30 of last year, AMR earned $141.4 million, or $2.36 per share,
on revenue of $2.16 billion.
   ``This represents our fourth consecutive quarter of record
earnings,'' Chairman Robert L. Crandall said.
   Crandall said June was the best traffic month in the company's
history, with June 30 its busiest day ever.
   American had 21.8 percent share of the domestic market during the
quarter, continuing its recent claim to the nation's largest
carrier, Crandall said.
   Revenue yield per passenger mile, a key industry gauge, improved
in the quarter from 11.84 cents to 12.17 cents. The company's
passenger load factor also increased from 64.6 percent to 65.3
percent.
   For the first half of the year, AMR has earned $278.9 million, or
$4.43 per share, on revenue of $5.17 billion, compared to $209.8
million, or $3.49, on revenue of $4.13 billion in the first half of
last year.

   Better-than-expected news on inflation provided
the spark for a spirited rally in the stock market today.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 31.48 points to
2,576.06 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 975 up, 462
down and 503 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.2 percent in June, down from 0.6 percent the
month before.
   The consensus estimate on Wall Street had called for a 0.3
percent June increase.
   Though the latest figure came as no dramatic surprise, analysts
said, it bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further.
   The news helped push interest rates lower in the government
securities market today. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds, which
move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $2.50
for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.15
percent-8.18 percent range.
   Gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up 1| at

   Tandem Computers gained 1\ to 19[. The company reported per-share
earnings for its latest fiscal quarter of 31 cents, compared to 18
cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.82 to 186.73. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value

Eliminating export ... Also moving on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today he
disagrees with a Bush administration proposal to lift restrictions
on exporting personal computers to Soviet bloc nations.
   ``I do not support that decision,'' Cheney told reporters.
   ``My concern is that it will give them a computer capability that
has military applications. That should be avoided,'' the secretary
said.
   ``It gives them significant capabilities they do not now
possess,'' he said.
   Cheney termed inaccurate a Washington Post report that he had
been persuaded to withdraw Pentagon objections to the proposal
during a meeting with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   The decision reportedly came after a fierce debate among the top
members of President Bush's Cabinet.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, told of Cheney's remarks,
noted that Bush supports the decision on the computers.
   The Commerce Department announced Tuesday that it was removing
export controls on AT-compatible and similar desk-top personal
computers to non-communist nations.
   It said the administration will also propose to the 17-nation
Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM) that
export restrictions be lifted against the Soviet bloc nations.
   Cheney said he would prefer that exports be permitted for ``a
lower level of technology.''
   Mosbacher, in a statement released Tuesday, said Bush's trip to
Poland and Hungary had ``paved the way for expanding trade in areas
that improve prospects for prosperity in Eastern Europe without
harming America's national security.''
   ``Eliminating export controls on AT-compatible personal computers
is one way to meet this objective,'' he said. ``Consistent with the
spirit of the president's initiatives, we are creating new
opportunities for U.S. manufacturers to sell more widely abroad.''
   The AT is an IBM model that was widely emulated.
   The department said regulations removing the controls on exports
to Western nations will appear in the Federal Register on July 18
and be effective immediately.
   The COCOM committee, based in Paris, consists of Australia,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece,
Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey and the United States.
   ``The net result of this decontrol is to focus and maintain
export restrictions on those items that are truly strategic, and
that we can control effectively,'' Mosbacher said.
   ``In this case, these computers are available in 11 countries and
from 70 vendors outside COCOM countries,'' he added. Those countries
include Hungary and Czechoslovakia in the East Bloc.
   The department said there were about 6 million AT-compatible desk
top personal computers sold worldwide by U.S. companies in 1988. Of
those, 2.7 million worth more than $1 billion were sold outside the
United States.

   Ralston Purina Co. has agreed to sell its

Beatrice Foods Inc. of Canada.
   Terms of the agreement announced last week were not disclosed,

   Beatrice Foods of Canada is a cookie company based in Toronto and

   Bremner, based in Louisville, Ky., makes 19 varieties of cookies
and crackers. Many Bremner products sell under store labels or under
a Ralston label, Farrell said. Under the agreement, Bremner no
longer would be able to use the Ralston name.
   Bremner has 450 employees. Ralston bought the company in December
1977.

<HEAD>EEC Commission Proposes More Flexibility In Airline Fares</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Commission proposed
Wednesday to give European airlines more flexibility in setting
fares, but stopped well short of complete deregulation.
   European Commissioner for Competition Sir Leon Brittan said that
the proposals would ``remove obstacles to competition'' and should
thus lead to lower prices for consumers.
   EEC Transportation Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the package
was meant to strike a balance between price liberalization on the
one hand and maintaining high standards of safety and security on
the other.
   Brittan said the package also sought to avoid the U.S. experience
in deregulation, in which ``big airlines gobbled up smaller ones''
after price controls were lifted, through rules against predatory
pricing.
   Under the proposals, airlines flying between two EEC countries
could cut prices by up to 20 percent from the previous season if one
of the governments on the route approves. A price cut of more than
20 percent would trigger an anti-dumping procedure by the Commission.
   Moreover, price cuts of less than 20 percent could be challenged
by other airlines flying the route, or by the other government. The
cheaper fare would then be suspended for up to two months, while the
Commission investigates the charge, Van Miert said.
   The proposals will be sent to the EEC Council of Ministers for
consideration by national governments. Van Wiert and Brittan said
they hope the package can be adopted as EEC law and become effective
in July 1990.
   Under the current system, airlines must have the approval of both
governments on a route to cut prices, giving an effective veto on
fare reductions to governments seeking to protect a national airline.

   Negotiators for Northwest Airlines pilots said
Wednesday a strike is possible by Labor Day, but Los Angeles
investor Alfred Checchi said the strike threat won't stop him from
completing a takeover of the nation's fourth-largest carrier.
   Negotiators for the Air Line Pilots Association told leaders of
Northwest pilots Tuesday night that a breakdown in contract talks
``may be near.''
   But they also said that agreement on a new contract could be
reached ``within a matter of hours'' if NWA Inc. management would
bargain in a reasonable and responsive manner.'' NWA is the parent
company of Northwest Airlines.
   A spokesman for Northwest did not immediately return a phone call
Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the Northwest pilots Master Executive Council of ALPA
stopped short Tuesday night of endorsing Checchi's $4 billion plan
to buy NWA.
   ``They stopped short of a complete endorsement of his buyout
plan, but judged his financial and business plans to be viable,''
union spokesman Jim Halverson said Wednesday.
   Earlier Tuesday, former Republic Airlines pilots now working for
the Eagan-based Northwest embraced Checchi's $121-per-share takeover
bid.
   Halverson said the mediated contract talks were set to resume
Wednesday afternoon. Remaining issues are job security, work rules
and pay, he said.
   Before a strike could occur, an impasse in contract talks would
have to be decided by the National Mediation Board. If an impasse
were declared, it would be followed by a 30-day cooling-off period,
after which the pilots would be free to strike.
   Checchi said Wednesday his group intends to close the buyout deal
despite the strike threat. He said he considered the actions by the
Republic and the Northwest Master Executive Council on his buyout
plan ``very encouraging.''
   He also said he didn't know when the deal would be completed, but
it was ``pending very shortly.''
   Last week, sources close to the transaction said Checchi expected
to complete the deal before Aug. 1, the St. Paul Pioneer Press
Dispatch reported Saturday. The Star Tribune, also quoting
unidentified sources in its Saturday edition, said Checchi might
close the deal by Friday.
   Checchi also said Wednesday that a contract settlement might be
reached before the deal is closed.
   ``These pilots and the company have been involved in negotiations
for almost two years and that process seems to be coming to a
satisfactory conclusion,'' he said. ``It's my understanding they're
very close and, sometimes when you get closest, it's kind of a point
of maximum frustration for both sides.''
   Former Republic Airlines pilots who joined Northwest in the
acquisition of Republic in 1986 have been without a contract for the
past 2{ years while the contract covering Northwest pilots expired
three years ago.
   Talks to bring the pilots under one pact began in April 1987 and
broke off last November, when 96 percent voted to authorize a
strike. Northwest then requested federal mediation and the talks
resumed in December.
   Northwest spokesmen said last week that, as long as talks
continued, an agreement was possible.
   But in the ALPA statement issued Wednesday, pilot leaders
expressed ``increasing impatience'' with the lack of progress in
contract talks and said a breakdown ``seems inevitable if talks
aimed at a new contract do not produce an agreement within a matter
of days.''
   As for the Checchi buyout plan, Halverson said Northwest pilot
leaders ``had some difficulty in divorcing an endorsement of the
Checchi buyout proposal from a lack of progress in contract
negotiations.''
   ``He (Checchi) has been saying it's a done deal. On the other
hand, he says he has little or no influence in contract
negotiations,'' Halverson said. ``And we're saying it's difficult to
reconcile those two statements.''
   Checchi said Wednesday he doesn't own the airline and, therefore,
it ``would be totally inappropriate for me to be involved in
contractual negotiations of an enterprise that I don't control.''
   Halverson said Northwest pilots are concerned about the ``large
debt load'' in the buyout offer. ``That's a problem for all
pilots,'' he said.
   The Northwest pilots, however, did conclude that the buyout plan
``appears viable'' from a business and financial standpoint. The
Northwest group passed a resolution saying it endorses the Checchi
group's ``stated intentions for market growth, expanded employment
opportunity and the promise of harmonious employee-employer
relations.''
   The Republic Master Executive Council called Checchi's proposal
the best available option to provide ``stability and growth
potential'' for NWA and its workers.
   But union spokesman Curt Kruse said Tuesday that former Republic
pilots' endorsement of Checchi's buyout offer doesn't mean pilots
are pleased about the pace of contract negotiations. He also
stressed that the pilots still have concerns over the debt Northwest
would incur.
   ``Nobody is entirely pleased with increasing the debt at
Northwest,'' Kruse said. ``However, once we had an opportunity to
review his (Checchi's) financial plan, our concerns diminished
somewhat. We still have concerns.''
   The Northwest MEC represents about 3,000 of the total 5,000
pilots employed by Northwest. The rest are represented by the
Republic Airlines MEC.

   The stock market rolled up a strong gain today,
inspired by better-than-expected news on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 36.60 points to
2,581.18 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 982 up, 484 down and
497 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.2 percent in June, down from 0.6 percent the

   The consensus estimate on Wall Street had called for a 0.3
percent June increase.
   Though the latest figure came as no dramatic surprise, analysts
said, it bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further.
   The news helped push interest rates lower in the government
securities market today. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds, which
move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $2.50
for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.15
percent-8.18 percent range.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed moderately
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as rainy weather
moved out of the Corn Belt and talk turned to expectations of
stronger foreign demand for grain.
   Soybeans for July delivery finished sharply higher but analysts
dismissed the rally, saying it represented limited buying in a thin
market ahead of the July contract's expiration on Thursday.
   A weather system that brought badly needed moisture to the
western Corn Belt states of Iowa and Minnesota was moving rapidly
eastward.
   ``Traders are expecting to see another drier pattern, or at least
to see a pattern that is not as favorable to the crops as what we
just saw,'' said Walter Spilka, a grain market analyst with Smith
Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. in New York.
   The rally in the corn market reflected a rise in cash prices,
which began climbing late Tuesday afternoon on rumors the Soviet
Union was seeking to buy some U.S. corn.
   Wheat futures were a little higher on perceptions of dry-weather
damage to the spring wheat crop.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.90 a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 6 cents higher with July at $2.54\ a bushel; oats were 4 cents to
4} cents higher with July at $1.46{ a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents
to 32{ cents higher with July at $7.28 a bushel and the more
actively traded August contract up 13 cents at $6.87 a bushel.

<HEAD>Profit Up at McGraw-Hill, LIN, ATC; Down at Media General</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   McGraw-Hill Inc., the publishing and information services
concern, said Wednesday its second-quarter earnings rose 13.3
percent, while another communications concern, Media General Inc.
said its profit fell 62.3 percent.
   LIN Broadcasting Corp., meanwhile, posted a 23.2 percent profit
increase for the second quarter while cable television operator
American Television &amp; Communications Corp. said its profit rose 12
percent.
   New York-based McGraw-Hill said it earned $50.8 million, or $1.04
a share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with $44.8
million, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier. Second-quarter revenue
rose 8.6 percent to $482.2 million from $443.7 million.
   The company said its publishing, information services and
financial services operations each had higher revenue in the quarter.
   But income from operations fell to $77.0 million from $147.9
million a year ago, largely because last year's second-quarter
results included a $222 million gain on the sale of McGraw-Hill's
interest in a magazine operation in Japan.
   Operating profit rose 16.6 percent in the information services
company, dipped slightly in the publishing division that includes
books and Business Week magazine and fell 8.5 percent in financial
services, which includes the Standard &amp; Poor's credit rating service.
   For the first six months, McGraw-Hill earned $81.9 million, or
$1.68 a share, up from $71.8 million, or $1.48 a share, a year ago.
Six-month revenue rose to $898.3 million from $839.4 million a year
ago.
   Media General, based in Richmond, Va., said it earned $6.1
million, or 23 cents per share, in the April-June period compared
with $16.2 million, or 56 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue
fell to $149.9 million from $196.6 milion a year ago.
   The company said the decline reflects heavy newsprint
discounting, a weak newspaper economy and last year's exchange of
its Pomona, Calif., newsprint mill and cash paid for Media General
Class A stock to settle a takeover attempt.
   It said revenue from its newspaper segment was flat while revenue
from broadcasting and newsprint operations fell sharply, largely
because of the absence of revenue from its broadcast services unit
sold last December and the from the Pomona mill.
   For the first half of the year, Media General said its earnings
fell 35.4 percent to $17.9 million, or 69 cents per share, from
$27.7 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Six-month
revenue fell to $299.2 million from $382.6 million.
   Media General owns four daily newspapers in Richmond,
Winston-Salem, N.C., and Tampa, Fla.; 31 weekly newspapers;
television stations in Charleston, S.C., Jacksonville, Fla., and
Tampa; and two cable TV franchises in Virginia.
   LIN Broadcasting, a New York-based company that is the target of
a multibillion-dollar takeover bid from McCaw Cellular
Communications Inc., said it earned $27.6 million, or 52 cents a
share, in the second quarter, up from $22.4 million, or 42 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $66.2 million from $59.8 million.
   LIN said its latest results reflect pretax legal and financial
advisory costs of $3.4 million related to the McCaw offer. The
companies have said they are continuing talks although LIN
previously rejected a $120-a-share offer.
   For the first six months, LIN earned $47.8 million, or 90 cents
per share, up 34.3 percent from $35.6 million, or 66 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Six-month revenue rose to $119 million from $108 million a year
earlier.
   LIN has interests in cellular telephone communications systems,
operates seven television stations and publishes city guides for use
in hotels.
   American Television, a Stamford, Conn.-based cable operator that
is 82 percent owned by Time Inc., said it earned $23.2 million, or
21 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared with
$20.7 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue rose to $240.1 million for the quarter from $201.0
million a year ago.
   American Television said the results reflected a strong operating
performance as well as consolidation of its now wholly-owned cable
system in Memphis.
   For the first six months, ATC earned $43 million, or 39 cents per
share, up 12.3 percent from $38.3 million, or 35 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose to $472.8 million from $394.6 million a
year earlier.
   ATC owns or manages cable TV systems serving 4.1 million basic
cable customers, second only to the Telecommunications Inc. of
Denver with nearly 10 million basic cable customers.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., the information services
giant that produces the Nielsen television audience ratings, Moody's
credit ratings and a host of other business reports, said Wednesday
its profit rose 29.2 percent in the second quarter despite a slight
dip in revenue.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said it earned $150.4 million, or 80 cents per
share, for the three months ended June 30 compared with $116.4
million, or 62 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue slipped 0.2 percent to $1.058 billion from
$1.059 billion in 1988.
   Results for 1988 included $14.3 million in costs associated with
the company's May 1988 acquisition of the market research concern
IMS International.
   Dun &amp; Bradstreet said the decline in revenue partly reflected the
absence of results from Official Airline Guides, sold late last year
to publisher Robert Maxwell.
   In addition to the Nielsen TV ratings and Moody's Investors
Service credit rating, Dun &amp; Bradstreet offers Donnelly yellow pages
and marketing operations and the McCormack &amp; Dodge business reports.
   The company said its results were not affected by its
previously-disclosed settlement, subject to court approval, of
lawsuits involving allegations of overcharges for credit reports.
The settlement called for creation of an $18 million fund for
possible reimbursements to customers. It said the company had
previously provided for these costs.
   For the first six months, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said its earnings rose
21.8 percent to a record $293.7 million, or $1.57 a share, from
$241.1 million, or $1.29 a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose 2.4 percent to $2.12 billion from $2.07
billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Is Chrysler Becoming a Truck Company?</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto DT5</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. increasingly is getting a
reputation as a truckmaking company, a label Chairman Lee Iacocca
acknowledges but one he says is unwarranted.
   Yet analysts wonder if that may not be the smartest road for the
nation's third-largest vehicle maker to take.
   ``Right now, it's a truckmaker that also makes cars,'' said auto
analyst Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities Inc. of San
Francisco. ``I think it's an intelligent decision on Chrysler's part
because trucks make more money that cars.''
   Chrysler is expected to announce second-quarter earnings next
Monday near or slightly lower than those during the same time last
year. This time around, the company will be relying more on the
dollars generated by trucks than in the past, leading to speculation
the company is being driven by trucks.
   ``If you call minivans trucks, it looks that way because in the
last 40 days in total, we've sold one car for every truck,'' Iacocca
said in an interview this week. ``Other companies aren't quite in
that position, but that's just because of (Jeep) Cherokee strength
and minivan strength.''
   Chrysler, through its Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager, holds
56 percent of the minivan market in the United States. It was the
first to introduce the popular vehicles back in 1983 and since then
has held most of the market.
   Through the first half of this year, and for the first time in
history, Chrysler sold more domestically made light trucks than
cars. Together, those vehicles make up more than 90 percent of the
company's fleet.
   Through June 30 this year, the company sold 0.97 cars for each
truck. A year ago at the same time, the ratio was 1.14 cars per
truck. The gap was wider in the first half of 1987, as the company
sold 1.56 cars per truck.
   General Motors Corp.'s car sales have run slightly more than
twice the rate of its truck sales, and Ford sells better than 1.5
cars for every truck.
   Despite the dominance of truck sales at Chrysler, Iacocca said
the company is very much in the carmaking business.
   ``We can't become just a truck company,'' he said. ``We've got
good car programs. First of all, our luxury cars are in pretty good
shape because they're not too big.
   ``Then we have an all new platform coming in late '92,'' he said.
``That's a billion-dollar effort at a new mid-size group of cars and
they're coming along nicely,'' he said.
   ``The one that's tough is we don't have an (Dodge) Omni
replacement at the moment. Our smallest car really is the P-car, the
Plymouth Sundance-Dodge Shadow,'' he said.
   Chrysler isn't letting today's truck business take care of
tomorrow. There will be more competition in the segment beginning in
the next few months as the new GM minivans come to the market and as
imports, including Mazda, bring in more foreign-made versions.
   A growing number of companies also are offering sport-utility
vehicles, and Chrysler will be among them.
   The company has broken ground for a new assembly plant in Detroit
which will make a Jeep code-named the ``ZJ.'' Earlier this year,
Iacocca announced that Chrysler and the French automaker Renault
would join forces to make a smaller sport-utility vehicle named the
``JJ.''
   Both of those products are to be introduced in the early 1990s
and means the company will have more truck production capacity than
it does now.
   ``People look at the car side and wonder if they are at a
competitive disadvantage to Ford and General Motors,'' said analyst
Charles Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York. ``That's hopefully
just a temporary condition.
   ``But clearly, now you can make an excellent case if you want to
classify it as a truckmaker,'' he said. ``I think in the insider
area, they've neglected the car area. Over the next couple of years,
you'd have to say the show belongs mostly to the truck side of the
operation.''

   Boys across America may shake their heads in dismay, but the
courts have spoken: G.I. Joe is a doll, not a toy soldier.
   Hasbro Industries Inc. had sought to get Joe out of duty _ import
tariffs, that is _ by battling the less-than-macho designation of
doll. But a panel of three federal judges wasn't persuaded.
   Not to worry, said company officials in Pawtucket, R.I.
   ``G.I. Joe is still one of the guys,'' said Donald Robbins,
Hasbro vice president and general counsel. ``Boys know who he is.''
   ``Even though G.I. Joe has lost this battle, hopefully he will
not lose his courage for combat,'' wrote Judge Paul R. Michel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, upholding the
U.S. Customs Service in a July 12 ruling.
   At issue in the case was not just G.I. Joe's macho image, but a
sizable chunk of his booty from the toy wars. Since Hasbro began
importing G.I. Joe from Hong Kong in 1982, the Customs Service has
imposed a 12 percent tariff, amounting to millions of dollars.
   Last year, Hasbro argued before the U.S. Court of International
Trade in New York that G.I. Joe is just an updated version of the
traditional toy soldier and should not be subject to the duties
placed on imported dolls.
   Although he wears military duds, brandishes a submachine gun and
lugs an assault pack, both the trade court and the appeals court
ruled that Joe fit the standard definition of ``a representation of
a human being used as a child's plaything'' _ in other words, a doll.
   Ten-year-old Michael Ritchie of Allenwood, Texas, who has about
40 G.I. Joe figures, was skeptical.
   ``It's not really a doll,'' he said. ``It'd be weird for me if I
saw a girl playing with G.I. Joe, 'cause I never have. Girls usually
play with a doll or something.''
   ``The decision had an attempt at humor. But they really strictly
applied the dictionary definition,'' M. Barry Levy, who argued the
case for Hasbro, said from his New York office.
   When introduced 25 years ago, G.I. Joe was a pioneer in the
marketing of flexible plastic figurines to boys. Hasbro was always
careful to refer to him either as a ``mannequin'' or ``action
figure,'' never a doll.
   After a lull in sales in the late 1970s, Joe's popularity surged
in the 1980s as baby-boomers began buying their children the same
toys they had as kids. Since 1964, total sales of the G.I. Joe line
have exceeded $1.2 billion, Hasbro said.
   But like other old soldiers, Joe seems to be gradually fading
away. From his original 11{-inch size in 1964, he shrank to 8{
inches in 1976 and then to 3{ inches in 1982.
   At the same time, he has lost some of his maneuverability and now
comes permanently clothed in fatigues, rather than removable
uniforms.
   One thing hasn't changed, however. No matter what the courts say,
Hasbro marketing agents still talk about Joe as an ordinary GI,
dogface, paratrooper, ranger, green beret, grunt or leatherneck.
   Just about anything but a doll.

<HEAD>Earnings Up 1.7 Percent In 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Champion International Corp. said
Wednesday its second-quarter earnings eged up 1.7 percent despite
operating problems at several of its pulp and paper mills.
   The wood products company posted second-quarter earnings of $114
million, or $1.16 per share, compared with $112 million, or $1.15 a
share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 1.6 percent to $1.28 billion compared
to $1.26 billion last year.
   For the first six months, Champion earned $227 million, or $2.32
a share, on sales totalling $2.6 billion. In the first six months of
1988, the company earned $214 million, or $2.19 a share, on revenues
of $2.5 billion.
   ``Difficulties in bringing rebuilds back on line and other
operating problems marred what would otherwise have been a better
second quarter and first half,'' said Andrew C. Sigler, chairman and
chief executive officer.

   State insurance regulators could use legal
hurdles to stall or even block a new hostile takeover bid clouding
the future of Farmers Insurance Group Inc.
   Britain's BAT Industries PLC, which swallowed up Farmers less
than a year ago after another hostile battle, last week became the
target of an investment group headed by takeover strategist Sir
James Goldsmith.
   That group has said it will sell the Los Angeles-based insurance
giant if its $21 billion takeover proposal succeeds.
   Insurance regulators in the nine states where Farmers operates
are not saying whether they will oppose the new bid. But the
proposal appears likely to face the same regulatory hurdles that
slowed BAT's takeover last year.
   ``A major issue here is: Should insurance companies be subject to
these types of takeovers?'' asked Ted Kulongoski, director of the
Oregon Department of Insurance and Finance. Kulongoski has final say
over the Goldsmith group's application to take over Farmers in his
state.
   ``When you have a product that is such an integral part of
society, that the government mandates, should it be subject to
takeovers that can load debt on the company and pass it off to the
consumer?'' Kulongoski said.
   Oregon, Washington and Idaho regulators initially opposed BAT's
takeover of Farmers last year, giving in only after the hostile bid
was replaced by a friendly merger agreement.
   California regulators also rejected the merger, but that decision
was overturned by a state court.
   The Goldsmith proposal faces reviews by regulators in those
states, along with regulators in Ohio, Texas, Illinois, Arizona and
Kansas.
   ``We all didn't know we were having a dress rehearsal for this
summer's production,'' Ed Southon, deputy state insurance
commissioner in Washington, said of the new bid.
   ``We haven't taken a position for or against,'' Southon said.
``But if it is decided that this is a hostile takeover, we will
probably handle it the same way we did last year _ by opposing it.''
   In California, where the insurance company is based and does
about 40 percent of its business, state Department of Insurance
officials complained that the acquisition application the Goldsmith
group filed was incomplete.
   ``We now have to review the application and will not comment on
it until the 60-day review process is up,'' said department attorney
Lorraine Johnson.
   Ms. Johnson said the application, received last week, would not
be reviewed until it was considered ``substantially complete.'' She
declined to elaborate.
   Goldsmith's investment group made its $21.5 billion bid on July
11, saying BAT's strategy of diversifying into financial services
had failed. Goldsmith said that if the takeover succeeds, he would
sell the group's non-tobacco businesses, including Farmers, to pay
takeover costs.
   Farmers has about $11 billion in assets, most in the insurance
business. It ranks third in home and auto insurance behind State
Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s
Allstate unit, and is the nation's seventh-largest property and
casualty insurance company.
   Insurance analyst Gerald Lewinsohn of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. in
New York said he didn't know of any case in which state regulators
effectively blocked the takeover of an insurance company. ``But they
sure can drag things out for a long time with hearings,'' he said.
   ``If you review the battle by Farmers last year, you can see what
can happen. Each state held hearings,'' he said.
   Farmers initially resisted the merger last year with BAT, the
world's largest tobacco company, suggesting BAT had suppressed
research pointing to the dangers of smoking.
   State regulators also expressed concern that BAT would drop
Farmers' special discounts for non-smokers. The company owns the
maker of Kool and Viceroy cigarettes, among others.
   Farmers also persuaded numerous state and national lawmakers to
attack BAT because it has operations in racially segregated South
Africa.
   The initial resistance paid off for the insurance company and its
shareholders. After an acrimonious battle, Farmers in August 1988
agreed to a $5.2 billion cash acquisition at a price $15 per share
higher than the initial $4.2 billion offer of January 1988.
   Farmers spokesman Jeffrey C. Beyer declined to discuss the
Goldsmith offer, referring all questions to Batus, BAT's U.S.
subsidiary in Louisville, Ky. Batus spokesman Wyatt Wilson also
declined comment.
   BAT's board of directors has said it considers the proposed offer
unwelcome and voted to reject it.

   Stock prices responded to upbeat news on
inflation Wednesday with a strong rally that carried the market to
new highs since the crash of 1987.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 39.65 to 2,584.41,
stretching its gain since the start of the month to 144.35 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,058 up, 458 down and 495 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 215.74 million
shares, up from 152.35 million Tuesday and the heaviest total since
244.51 million were traded on June 16.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 252.14 million shares.
   The Labor Department reported Wednesday morning that the consumer
price index rose 0.2 percent in June, down from 0.6 percent the
month before. The consensus estimate on Wall Street had called for a
0.3 percent June increase.
   Though the latest figure came as no dramatic surprise, analysts
said, it bolstered hopes that the Federal Reserve might soon relax
its credit policy further.
   The news helped push interest rates lower in the government
securities market today. Prices of long-term Treasury bonds, which
move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose about $5
for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.15
percent-8.17 percent range.
   Philip Morris, which reported sharply higher earnings for the
second quarter, climbed 3 to 147.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included General Electric, up
2 at 56\; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up ] at 36~; Exxon, up ~
at 46[; McDonald's, up } at 30}, and Procter &amp; Gamble 3[ to 117[.
   Pollution-control and waste-management stocks were especially
strong, benefiting from recent bullish views on the Street about the
outlook for environmental cleanup and protection efforts. Waste
Management picked up 2] to 57~; Browning-Ferris Industries 1} to
38~, and Rollins Environmental } to 11[.
   Tandem Computers gained 1| to 19{ in active trading. The company
reported per-share earnings for its latest fiscal quarter of 31
cents, compared to 18 cents in the comparable period a year earlier.
   On the downside, McDonnell Douglas dropped 5] to 72 as the
company posted a $48 million loss for the second quarter.
   Snap-On Tools, which reported lower second-quarter profits, took
a 3|-point tumble to 36.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $36.05 billion, or 1.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
2.19 to 187.10.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 5.49 to 384.22, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 4.38 at 335.73.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
3.37 to 451.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 372.40, up 2.23.

<HEAD>Honeywell's Profit More Than Doubles in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honeywell Inc. said Wednesday its profit more
than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier.
   The defense contractor and building controls maker reported that
its second-quarter profit jumped to $74.8 million, or $1.73 a share,
from $31.6 million, or 75 cents a share, in the second quarter of
1988.
   Honeywell lost $435 million in 1988 and announced last month that
it would cut its workforce of 78,000 by 300, mostly through layoffs.
   ``The strong second-quarter results, following a good first
quarter, indicate we are making progress in improving our financial
performance,'' said James J. Renier, chairman and chief executive
officer. ``We look forward to the second half of the year with
confidence.''
   The 1988 second quarter included after-tax charges of $43
million, or $1.01 a share, related to unrecoverable contract costs
and the discontinuance of a product line, Honeywell said. Those 1988
charges were partially offset by a gain of $15 million, or 35 cents
a share, from the sale of real estate.
   Second-quarter revenue this year rose 1.8 percent, to $1.78
billion from $1.75 billion in 1988.
   Profit for the first half of this year increased 54.2 percent _
to $137.7 million, or $3.19 a share, from $89.3 million, or $2.11 a
share, a year earlier. The increase occurred despite a 1.2 percent
decline in first-half revenue to $3.45 billion from $3.49 billion.
   Renier said operating profit in Honeywell's industrial business
was up substantially, with notable strength in industrial automation
systems. Space and aviation systems also posted strong profit in the
second quarter, led by a substantial increase in commercial avionics
results and continued recovery in the military avionics group,
compared with a loss in the second quarter of 1988.
   Operating profit declined modestly in Honeywell's home and
building automation and control business, as expected, due to
continuing softness in construction markets. Profits from commercial
services, on the other hand, increased significantly.
   Profit declined in the company's defense and marine systems
business, compared with very strong results in the same period last
year.

   Gasoline futures prices tumbled Wednesday,
dragging down crude prices, after a report showed a steep rise in
gasoline inventories.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery fell 1.37 cents
to 54.69 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Other
contract months generally declined, with September falling 1.13
cents to 53.37 cents a gallon.
   Among other refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale
heating oil for August delivery fell .13 cent to 50.37 cents a
gallon.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for August delivery fell 53
cents to $19.81 per barrel, dropping below what analysts consider a
key psychological barrier at $20.
   Analysts said a sharper-than-expected rise in gasoline
inventories dragged prices lower.
   The American Petroleum Institute weekly report, released after
the close of trading Tuesday, showed total motor gasoline stocks
rose 5.2 million barrels to 222.855 million barrels in the week
ended July 14. Heating stocks also rose by 5.4 million barrels to
110.2 million during the week.
   ``People made the decision that the marketplace is over with for
gasoline and there was strong selling,'' said Madison Galbraith,
senior energy specialist for Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. ``They
decided we have enough gasoline around for the summer, there's no
problem anymore and they're saying they don't want to hold any
more.''
   Energy analysts said a rise in gasoline inventories was
anticipated but such an steep increase was not expected.
   The demand for gasoline has weakened in recent weeks due to
rising retail prices at the pump.
   Prices soared in March and April as refiners bought gas in
anticipation of possible shortages in the face of expected strong
consumption during the summer driving season. But the expected
demand never materialized due to the high prices, analysts said.
   Crude oil stocks were 1.4 million barrels lower at 331.3 million
for the week, API reported.

   The dollar gained ground against most major
foreign currencies Wednesday in an unusual reaction to inflation
news that ordinarily might have dampened enthusiasm for dollar
buying.
   Gold prices dropped, reflecting the good U.S. inflation reading
and the dollar's advance. Investors often choose gold as a hedge
against rising inflation.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery tumbled $4.30 to $368.30 a troy ounce. Republic National
Bank of New York quoted a bid of $368.20 for an ounce of bullion at
4 p.m. EDT, down $3.70 from Tuesday's late bid.
   Immediately after the Labor Department reported in the early
morning that the Consumer Price Index edged up 0.2 percent in June,
currency dealers sold dollars. Last month's CPI rate was
significantly smaller than May's 0.6 percent increase and the lowest
monthly rate since February 1988.
   The initial dollar selling was based on the thinking that
moderating inflation could increase the chances for the Federal
Reserve Board to loosen its credit policies further and drive down
U.S. interest rates.
   But the dollar sales soon abated.
   John McCarthy, chief currency dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam
Bank's New York office, said renewed demand for dollars emerged when
it became apparent that the sellers lacked enough conviction to push
the dollar below thresholds considered technically important.
   Plus, the dollar benefited from rallies in the stock and bond
markets Wednesday, which indicated that demand for
dollar-denominated investments remains robust despite the
possibility of lower U.S. interest rates.
   ``I think the fact that U.S. rates are declining is not a barrier
to interest in the dollar,'' said McCarthy.``People are buying U.S.
securities for capital appreciation. The attractiveness of the U.S.
bond and stock markets makes the dollar attractive.''
   The financial markets will be waiting Thursday for clues about
Fed policy when Alan Greenspan, the central bank chairman, testifies
at a congressional hearing.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 141.80 Japanese yen, down from
142.35 yen. In London late Wednesday the dollar traded higher at
141.90 yen. Later, in New York, the dollar closed at 142.50 yen, up
from 141.50 on Tuesday.
   The British pound weakened against the dollar. Strikes by British
labor unions recently have discouraged investor interest in
sterling. One pound cost $1.6195 late in London, cheaper for buyers
than late Tuesday's level of $1.6255. Sterling fetched $1.6127 late
in New York's day vs. Tuesday's $1.6235.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.9125 West German marks, up from 1.8960; 1.6565
Swiss francs, up from 1.6430; 6.486 French francs, up from 6.4325;
1,380.50 Italian lire, up from 1,372.00; and 1.18885 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.19115.
   Selected late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Tuesday's late rates were: 1.9007 West German marks, up from 1.8920;
1.6465 Swiss francs, up from 1.6395; 6.4490 French francs, up from
6.4175; 2.1340 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1505; 1,374.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,379.50; and 1.1887 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1907.
   Gold bullion prices moved lower.
   Gold closed in London, the major market, at a bid of $371.75 a
troy ounce, down from $371.95. The closing Zurich price was $371
bid, down from $371.50.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at a bid of $372.05, up from
$369.75.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.23 a troy ounce, down
from $5.27. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery
closed at $5.153 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's settlement of
$5.242.

   USX Corp. stock traded higher Wednesday despite
a jury verdict that a former unit of the Pittsburgh oil, gas and
steel concern should pay at least $243.5 million in an antitrust
case.
   In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, USX stock closed
at $35.87{, up 62{ cents a share.
   The rise reflects investors' relief that the jury's verdict fell
short of recent projections, said analyst Andrew Gray of the
investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   There was also doubt about who would ultimately be responsible
for the damages and whether the award will withstand appeals.
   A plaintiff's attorney had said that with the doubling and
trebling of certain of the damages, the Bessemer &amp; Lake Erie
railroad could owe $638 million under the verdict returned Tuesday
in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.
   Several analysts had projected the company's liability at $1
billion, Gray said.
   Plaintiffs including four major steel producers accused the B&amp;LE
of conspiring in 1983 and 1984 to block the development of
self-unloading ore boats in order to retain business hauling ore to
steel plants.
   USX sold the B&amp;LE last year to Transtar Inc., a holding of
Blackstone Capital Partners LP.
   ``When Blackstone and Transtar bought the B&amp;LE they didn't assume
any responsibility for the liability in this incident,'' USX
spokesman William Ryder said Wednesday. ``Whether USX will be
ultimately responsible remains to be litigated'' with Blackstone.
   The $638 million figure represents the ``speculation or
extrapolation on the part of the plaintiffs' attorney,'' he said.
   ``The fact of life is ... this is only the district court. It
could go higher'' and the award could be reduced on appeals, Gray
said.
   Gray said he expects USX earnings to remain strong with potential
for growth should natural gas prices rise as expected and petroleum
exploration intensify, boosting sales of the company's highly
profitable tubular goods.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Slump To 4-Week Low As Inflation Cools</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices slumped to their lowest levels in a month
Wednesday as investors dumped precious metals and snapped up stocks
following a government report showing a slowdown in inflation.
   On other markets, stock-index futures soared; energy futures
plunged; grains and soybeans advanced; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Gold settled $4.30 to $4.90 lower on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in August at $369.30 a troy
ounce and the spot July contract at $368.30. It was gold's lowest
close since June 16, when the August contract settled at $368.80.
   Silver futures fell 8.9 cents to 10.4 cents with July at $513.30
a troy ounce.
   The Labor Department's report of a lower-than-expected 0.2
percent rise in consumer prices in June prompted an immediate dip in
the gold market and primed it for a big drop when the dollar rallied
in afternoon trading.
   ``They were particularly unsettled by the Consumer Price Index
because even after you subtracted food and energy, you still got a
low number,'' said John O'Connell, a precious-metals market analyst
in New York with the futures brokerage Refco Inc.
   He said traders typically strip the food and energy components
from the government's inflation indicators to get a truer picture of
how Federal Reserve Board policies are affecting price movements.
Food and energy prices are less affected by monetary policies than
prices of other goods, O'Connell said.
   Gold prices began falling last week following another government
report that showed inflation at the wholesale level slowing. Gold is
often perceived as an inflation-resistant investment.
   Despite gold's weakness, analysts weren't quite ready to turn
bearish on a market that has shown a good deal of strength in the
past six weeks.
   ``I think we still have to go down a few dollars to technically
confirm the weakness,'' said Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst
with PaineWebber Inc.
   Stock-index futures approached an all-time high on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange as program trading and arbitrage boosted both
stock and futures prices.
   The contract for September delivery of stocks tracked by the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index settled 3.7 points higher at 338.25. The
September contract traded as high as 339, just 0.45 point below the
all-time high for a near-month contract.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials jumped 39.83 points to 2,584.41.
   Gasoline futures prices tumbled on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, dragging down crude prices, after a report showed a steep
rise in gasoline inventories.
   The American Petroleum Institute weekly report, released after
the close of trading Tuesday, showed total motor gasoline stocks
rose 5.2 million barrels to 222.855 million barrels in the week
ended July 14. Heating oil stocks rose by 5.4 million barrels to
110.2 million during the week.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents to 49 cents
lower with August at $19.85 a barrel; heating oil was .13 cent lower
to .03 cent higher with August at 50.37 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was unchanged to 1.37 cents lower with August at 54.69
cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures finished moderately higher on the
Chicago Board of Trade as rainy weather moved out of the Corn Belt
and talk turned to expectations of stronger foreign demand for grain.
   Soybeans for July delivery finished sharply higher but analysts
dismissed the rally, saying it represented limited buying in a thin
market ahead of the July contract's expiration on Thursday.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 3} cents higher with July at $3.90 a
bushel; corn was { cent to 6 cents higher with July at $2.54\ a
bushel; oats were 4 cents to 4} cents higher with July at $1.46{ a
bushel; soybeans were 7\ cents to 32 cents higher with July up 32
cents at $7.27{ a bushel and the more actively traded August
contract up 13{ cents at $6.87{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in position-squaring ahead of Friday's quarterly
Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report.
   Live cattle settled .13 cent lower to .15 cent higher with August
at 72.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent lower to .10
cent higher with August at 83.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .25
cent to .85 cent higher with July at 48.02 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .80 cent lower to .75 cent higher with July at
29.02 cents a pound.

   Mud-slinging campaign ads are alienating
voters, allowing advocacy groups to skew the political process and
should be reined in while Congress grapples with runaway campaign
spending, a Senate panel was told Wednesday.
   ``Independent'' groups with no official ties to individual
candidates are pouring millions into virulent, ``hit and run''
campaign ads on radio and TV without identifying themselves or their
true motives, often in the waning days of campaigns when there is no
time for response, Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., said.
   Bryan told the Senate Commerce communications subcommittee he
feared such tactics would become the ``wave of the future'' and
would go unchecked while Congress bickers over a comprehensive
solution to the problem of soaring campaign spending.
   Several senators, including Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest F.
Hollings, D-S.C., agreed that a comprehensive campaign spending
reform bill was needed, but that it had become mired down in
partisan battles over proposed spending limits. They said a
piecemeal approach may be the only solution.
   Wednesday's hearing was on two campaign ad bills. One introduced
by Bryan and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., would require sponsors of
campaign ads to identify themselves more clearly on screen. A bill
by Hollings and Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and John Danforth,
R-Mo., would require broadcasters to provide free air time to anyone
targeted by a negative ad from the ``independent'' groups. The bill
also would require candidates to personally appear in any ad that
mentions his or her opponent.
   Hollings said his intent was not to limit the content of
political ads but to give voters ``clear and direct'' discussion of
issues in which ``the person who makes the claim is held
responsible.'' He said that cannot happen when candidates themselves
don't appear in ads.
   He said it was a misnomer to call PACs independent, that they
often are connected with a candidate or political party and that
they spent $10 million on broadcast ads in 1986.
   ``These independent parties are responsible to no one, especially
the voter,'' Hollings said. ``Yet their enormous expenditures can
throw a campaign way off balance.''
   Except on one occasion when Hollings attacked Sen. Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., for ads depicting ``bloodhounds'' searching for an
absentee opponent, the senators generally steered clear of the
touchy subject of negative ads carried out by a candidate's campaign.
   One witness, however, political analyst Curtis Gans, showed
memorable attack ads, including Lyndon Johnson's ads hitting Barry
Goldwater on nuclear weapons issues in 1964, Sen. Quentin Burdick,
D-N.D., being ``bought'' by Eastern labor unions and an ad against
Sen. James Sasser of Tennessee that showed a Fidel Castro-like
figure lighting a cigar with a stack of American foreign aid dollars.
   Gans said negative ads weren't new, just more prolific. He said
spending on the five most expensive Senate races increased 10-fold
from 1974 to 1984, with television ad costs mushrooming 30-fold.
   Since the 1960s, he added, voter turnout in presidential and
midterm congressional elections has declined more than 20 percent.
   He said the decline in voting and the rise in campaign spending
was ``not coincidental.''

<HEAD>Nervous Investors Cause Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Worried investors have pushed the stock price
of Micron Technology Inc. down about 20 percent in the past week,
and things may get worse before they get better.
   Analysts point to growing uncertainty about prices and the sales
outlook for dynamic random access memory chips. Also cited are big
sales of Micron stock by company founder Ward Parkinson and his twin
brother Joe Parkinson, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Boise semiconductor company.
   Memory chips, or DRAMs, are Micron's mainstay product and are an
essential component of computers and a growing variety of other
electronic products.
   Micron executives declined to discuss the stock price decline.
The stock, which closed at $18.50 a share on July 10, was $15.12{ on
Wednesday in over-the-counter trading. The stock hit its 52-week
high of $25.75 in mid-June.
   Some analysts have cut earnings estimates for Micron's fourth
quarter and fiscal year 1989 that ends Aug. 31.
   Richard Whittington, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities in
New York, projects earnings per share this year will be $3, down
from $3.25 in 1988. Per-share earnings could slip to $2 in 1990 and
may go lower, he said.
   ``Prices have tipped over in the past two months after two years
of stability,'' Whittington said. ``You are not seeing (chip)
dumping by Japan; you are seeing demand dry up.''
   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. analyst Michael Gumport said fourth-quarter
earnings will be ``substantially less'' than 85 cents per share.
   On June 1, the company had 38.4 million shares outstanding. It
earned $1.27 per share in the fourth quarter of last year.
   ``Essentially, the spot price (for DRAMs) passed below the
contract price,'' Gumport said. ``Customers balked. They are saying,
`Why should we buy them under contract when we can get them cheaper
somewhere else.'''
   On Monday, Montgomery Securities analyst Daniel Klesken
reportedly cut his fourth-quarter projection from 80 cents a share
to 45 cents.
   ``Apparently the market is trying to signal us to the fact that
they believe tougher times are on the way,'' Micron spokesman Kipp
Bedard said Tuesday.
   Micron's stock went through similar convulsions last year.
   Insider sales, the departures of two senior officers and rumors
of impending price declines combined to depress the stock. Between
June and September 1988, it went from about $26 to $14.50 before
recovering.
   Bedard said the $250 million expansion under way at Micron's
southeast Boise plant would not be affected by the latest events on
Wall Street.
   ``We are firmly committed to this business, long-term,'' he said.
``We do believe memory opportunities through the 1990s are just
outstanding.''
   Before worries started eroding Micron's stock price, Parkinson
reportedly sold 25,000 shares June 19-20. He retains 23,350 shares.
On Dec. 3, he owned 91,549 shares.
   Ward Parkinson, who resigned abruptly in May for personal
reasons, is said to have sold 150,000 shares on June 19. He still
holds 117,775 shares, down from 389,974 shares on Dec. 3.

<HEAD>Reports 15 Percent Drop In 2nd-Qtr Profit, Anti-Takeover Strategy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Conrail announced Wednesday that its profit
dropped 15 percent in the second quarter of the year, blaming the
coal strike, inflation and an accelerated maintenance schedule.
   In addition, the freight railroad announced adoption of a
strategy to discourage hostile takeover attempts.
   Earnings totaled $82 million, or $1.19 per share, for the second
quarter, compared with $97 million, or $1.41 per share, a year
earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue edged up to $881 million from $879 million
last year.
   Operating income fell, primarily because of lost traffic during
the coal strike in June, said James A. Hagen, chairman, chief
executive and president of the railroad.
   Inflation pushed costs up by $10 million and $8 million worth of
equipment and maintenance work was finished earlier this year than
last, affecting the bottom line in the second quarter, Hagen said.
   For the first six months of the year, Conrails' earnings were
down 2 percent to $142 million, or $2.07 per share, on revenue of
$1.75 billion. Conrail earned $145 million, or $2.10 per share, on
revenue of $1.71 billion for the first six months of 1988.
   Conrail's board adopted a so-called shareholder rights plan
intended to make taking control of the company more expensive for an
unwanted investor.
   ``The rights are designed to assure that all of Conrail's
stockholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any
proposed takeover of the company and to guard against the use of
abusive tactics to gain control of the company without paying all
shareholders a premium value,'' Hagen said.
   The plan is intended to encourage suitors to negotiate with the
board of directors, he said. The strategy is not in response to any
threat or proposed takeover, Hagen said.
   The plan issues one right per share to stockholders. If an
unwanted suitor's stake in the company increase to more than 10
percent, all shareholders except the raider can use their rights to
buy two shares of stock for the price of one.
   The company also Wednesday declared a 35 cent dividend, up from
the 30 cent dividend declared a year ago.

<HEAD>Eastern Officials Say Smaller August Expansion Not Sign of Failure</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The top officials of Eastern Airlines on Wednesday
maintained that the overall program to rebuild the strikebound
carrier is proceeding well despite having to cut back on a planned
flight schedule expansion next month.
   Eastern Chairman Frank Lorenzo and President Phil Bakes also said
negotiations with striking pilots were not going well, denounced a
plan by Chicago businessman Joseph Ritchie and the unions to buy the
airline, and announced a plan to buy new aircraft.
   As about 20 strikers picketed outside a downtown Atlanta hotel,
Bakes told a news conference that too much attention is being paid
to the actual number of flights Eastern will have in its planned
August expansion.
   The airline originally promised to have 390 flights daily by Aug.
1 but said this week some reductions may be necessary. Before the
strike by Machinists, pilots and flight attendants that started
March 4, Miami-based Eastern had about 1,100 flights daily. It now
has 220.
   Bakes characterized the August expansion as merely part of a
nine-month plan to rebuild the airline without the unions.
   He said that so far Eastern has ``significantly exceeded those
plans.''
   Bakes refused to say exactly how many flights will be on the
schedule in August. He said the airline is refusing to take bookings
on flights for which crew training is incomplete.
   ``We have said we would fly approximately 390 flights, and when
we finish the month of August we will be somewhat less than that,''
Bakes said. ``But putting it in context, it is literally irrelevant
to the strategy the company is on.
   ``The overall plan is coming along very, very nicely,'' he said.
   Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association,
accused Lorenzo and Bakes of ``putting a happy face on a ridiculous,
sorry situation.''
   Cole said the reduction in the projected August flights is a
clear sign that Eastern's rebuilding plan is not working.
   ``Lorenzo is setting up the travel agents and the traveling
public to take another bath,'' Cole said from Tampa, Fla., where
representatives of Eastern and the pilots union have been meeting
for several days.
   Bakes said the airline has made progress in financial results,
hours flown and numbers of passengers carried. He insisted that
Eastern has enough money from the sale of assets to persevere
through the rebuilding period, though he would not respond when
asked how much money the airline was losing each day.
   Eastern is awaiting a ruling from a federal bankruptcy judge on
its request to release $100 million being held in escrow by the
company's creditors, to finance the August expansion.
   The appearance by Lorenzo and Bakes in Atlanta followed
unconfirmed reports that negotiations between the company and the
pilots union had broken down. The two Eastern officials refused to
discuss specifics of the talks but said they were not making
progress.
   ``I can't be here bubbling with optimism about where they (the
talks) are going,'' said Lorenzo, who also is chairman of Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp.
   Lorenzo also dismissed the plan by Ritchie and the unions to buy
Eastern as a ``public relations attempt.''
   Ritchie said Tuesday he is close to securing a ``highly
confident'' letter from his financial adviser, Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. In the letter, Shearson says it would agree to raise
$280 million in debt financing for the Eastern bid, Ritchie told The
Wall Street Journal.
   Ritchie, the principal owner and president of Chicago Research &amp;
Trading Group, also said he has been talking with the AFL-CIO about
an additional $200 million for an employee stock ownership plan.
   ``Mr. Ritchie's proposal always has appeared to be insubstantial
and irrelevant,'' Lorenzo said.
   Lorenzo also announced that Houston-based Texas Air planned a
$2.8 billion purchase of new-generation Boeing 737-300 aircraft.
   The plan calls for 50 firm purchases and 50 options. Lorenzo said
40 of the jets are earmarked for Eastern and 60 for its sister
carrier, Continental Airlines. In addition, Continental has agreed
to buy 13 Airbus A300 jets and spare parts from Eastern for $303.5
million.

<HEAD>Union Vote Undercurrent at Celebration of 1-Millionth Nissan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Nissan's U.S. auto plant
drove the 1-millionth vehicle off the assembly line Wednesday in a
ceremony touting company unity, while a vote on union organization
loomed one week away.
   ``Nissan's growth has been built on teamwork,'' president Jerry
Benefield told workers and dealers who applauded as the white pickup
truck rolled off the line in the cavernous plant.
   Benefield made no direct references to the vote during the
ceremony.
   Afterward, he said he was limiting his comment on the issue to
leave it ``between the union and our employees.'' Benefield declined
to predict a victory over the United Auto Workers.
   ``I think our employees will speak for themselves,'' he said.
``We'll know next week how they feel.''
   About 2,400 hourly workers are to vote Wednesday and Thursday on
UAW representation at the eight-year-old Nissan Motor Manufacturing
USA plant, a subsidiary of the Japanese automaker.
   The factory, about 30 miles southeast of Nashville, is one of
three nonunion U.S. plants owned by Japanese automakers.
   It has been a target of the UAW, which is concentrating on worker
injuries and assembly line speeds as major campaign issues.
   Initially the plant only built light pickup trucks. But Sentra
passenger cars were added in March 1985.
   The milestone truck, given away through a drawing conducted by
Nissan dealers, resembled the first truck off the line in 1983 _ a
white pickup called Job 1.
   The company is preparing to add a third vehicle line in 1992,
bringing its total production capacity to 440,000 vehicles per year
and making it the highest volume facility under one roof in the
United States, according to Nissan.
   The non-union environment of Tennessee, a right-to-work state,
helped attract the highly sought plant, and Nissan officials
maintain the lack of a union helps production and employment expand.

<HEAD>Nursing Home Company Announces 2nd Qtr Loss; Big Investor Sells Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beverly Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest
operator of nursing homes, announced a $98 million second-quarter
loss Wednesday because of expenses associated with a restructuring,
inciting a big selloff in its stock.
   The company, which derives much of its income from Medicare
payments and has been struggling under a debt load of nearly $1
billion, said it was recording a $120 million pretax writeoff to
account for losses related to the sale or planned sale of 370
nursing homes with more than 38,000 beds.
   The second-quarter loss on revenue of $524 million compared with
earnings of $111,000 on revenue of $524 million in the year-earlier
quarter. Earnings per-share were negligible, because the company has
54 million shares outstanding.
   ``This is the critical step on the road back to consistent
profitability for Beverly,'' David Banks, who became chief executive
officer in May, told securities analysts in New York where the
earnings report was disclosed.
   But investors reacted negatively and the stock fell 87{ cents to
$8.25 in composite New York Stock Exchange volume of 5.24 million
shares.
   More than half the volume came from a single sale of 3.52 million
shares controlled by David H. Murdock, chairman of Castle &amp; Cook, a
Los Angeles-based food products concern.
   Murdock, who purchased the stock last year as an investment, said
in a statement released by his office that entities he controls sold
the entire stake at $8.62{ a share. He declined to specify his
reasons for selling the stake. Beverly spokesman Bill Ihle also
declined to comment.
   For the first six months of 1989, Beverly lost $107 million on
revenue of $1.03 billion, vs. a loss of $841,000 on revenue of $998
million for the first six months of 1988.
   Beverly, based in Pasadena, Calif., began a restructuring program
early last year to sell unprofitable facilities. Once all sales
announced Wednesday are completed, Beverly said, its beds will total
68,445, vs. 115,357 when the restructuring began. It will remain the
biggest U.S. nursing home operator.
   The company runs facilities in 38 states and the District of
Columbia with a workforce of more than 100,000 employees.

   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said Wednesday it lost
$48 million in the second quarter, citing the continuing effects of
a major reorganization of its transport aircraft business segment.
   The loss for the defense contractor caught stock analysts by
surprise and sent the company's stock on the New York Stock Exchange
into a tailspin.
   McDonnell Douglas stock fell $5 a share to $72.
   The second-quarter loss contrasted with a profit of $71 million,
or $1.83 a share, in the three months ended June 30, 1988.
   Second-quarter sales fell 3.6 percent to $3.476 billion from
$3.605 billion last year.
   The loss comes on the heels of a poor first quarter when the
company reported a $169 million profit only because of a $179
million one-time tax credit.
   For the first six months, McDonnell Douglass said it earned $121
million, or $3.18 a share, compared with $122 milion, or $3.16 a
share, a year earlier. Six-month revenue fell to $6.82 billion from
$6.92 billion.
   ``Clearly, two bad quarters in a row with such large losses seem
to say McDonnell Douglas is in real difficulty,'' said Phillip
Brannon, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research U.S. in New York.
   Brannon said he didn't expect the company's problems in the
transport segment, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of the
company's revenues, would have been so prolonged.
   ``This is definitely far worse than I think anyone anticipated,''
said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at Prudential-Bache in New York.
   In the transport segment, parts shortages and the training of
thousands of new employees have increased costs and forced the
reorganization, which began in February and affects 5,000 employees.
   McDonnell Douglas said improved performance in the combat
aircraft and information systems segments was overshadowed by a
second-quarter operating loss of $158 million in the transport
aircraft segment, which had revenues of $952 million. That compares
with operating earnings of $10 million on revenues of $1.1 billion
in the same quarter last year.
   The missiles, space and electronics systems segment had earnings
of $10 million in the quarter, down from $37 million in the same
period last year due to reduced earnings in the Delta II launch
vehicle program and a write-off reflecting higher-than-expected
costs in a laser communications program.

   Continental Airlines said Wednesday it is ordering
up to 100 new Boeing jets in a $2.8 billion deal that is the largest
ever for Texas Air Corp., the parent of both Continental and
strikebound Eastern Airlines.
   Forty of the new jets are earmarked for Eastern, now in the midst
of bankruptcy reorganization and a lingering strike. All the
purchases by Eastern first must be approved by a federal bankruptcy
court.
   Houston-based Texas Air also announced a complicated mix of
transactions in which Continental soon would purchase 11 widebody
Airbus A300 jets and spare parts from Eastern for $303.5 million.
Continental also would lease two McDonnell Douglas DC-10s from
Eastern and lease 34 jets back to its sister carrier.
   ``I think this is an important step in Continental's return to
profitability and confidence in the future of the airline,'' D.
Joseph Corr, Continental's chairman and chief executive officer,
told a news conference.
   ``What we're really doing is not only restructuring our fleet,
but we're also at the same time providing for our fleet way out into
the future,'' Corr said. ``Overall, we're looking at more seats to
more destinations than prior to these changes.''
   Under the deal, Houston-based Continental agreed to buy as many
as 60 of Boeing Co.'s narrow-body 737-300s, with deliveries of 30
aircraft planned for 1992 to 1994 and with an option to purchase
another 30 of the jets in 1995 and 1996.
   Total cost of the Continental purchase would be about $1.7
billion, Corr said, adding that about three-quarters of the new
fleet would replace aging aircraft.
   Corr declined to discuss financing for the purchase. Continental
posted a first-quarter loss of $16.5 million, narrowed from an $80.6
million loss in the same quarter of 1988.
   Continental, a non-union carrier which emerged from bankruptcy
reorganization in September 1986, and Miami-based Eastern were among
only three major U.S. airlines that did not have new planes on order
prior to the Boeing deal announced Wednesday. Pan Am Corp. is the
third carrier.
   Corr said the federal bankruptcy judge overseeing Eastern's
reorganization, Burton R. Lifland, probably will have the final say
over the airline's finances. But he said Continental's negotiations
on an order for Eastern planes had nothing to do with its sister
carrier's financial status.
   The agreement with Boeing allows Continental to substitute a
portion of its order for Boeing's 737-400s or 737-500s, which have
different seat capacities, allowing for greater flexibility as the
airline's needs change in the coming years, Corr said.
   He insisted that the prices were fair market value, denying any
suggestion that the arrangement was part of a shift in assets at the
expense of crippled Eastern.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney sharply
criticized an administration decision to allow the sale of personal
computers to Soviet bloc nations Wednesday, contending it gives them
computers ``with military applications.''
   Cheney sought out reporters to make a statement about the matter,
intent on clarifying a Washington Post story that he had been
``persuaded'' by Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher to support the
decision.
   ``I do not support that decision,'' Cheney said, appearing
clearly irritated.
   The secretary said he opposed the move because it would give the
Soviets ``significant capabilities they do not now possess.''
   Cheney's comments revealed the fierce debate waged inside
President Bush's Cabinet over the decision, which marks a major
shift in policy from the previous administration.
   Conservative members of that administration had sought to retain
tight control of high-tech exports to the Soviets, but this
administration's shift appears to have been influenced by the more
open attitude between the superpowers fostered by Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Mosbacher, in a statement released Tuesday, argued that Bush's
trip to Poland and Hungary had ``paved the way for expanding trade
in areas that improve prospects for prosperity in Eastern Europe
without harming America's national security.
   ``Eliminating export controls on AT-compatible personal computers
is one way to meet this objective,'' he said. ``Consistent with the
spirit of the president's initiatives, we are creating new
opportunities for U.S. manufacturers to sell more widely abroad.''
   Mosbacher said the administration had decided to lift controls on
such commonly used desktop models as the IBM PS@2 and AT models
because they were easily obtainable in 11 countries, including
Eastern Europe.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, told of Cheney's
criticism, said Bush was not informed in advance about the decision
but does support it.
   The Commerce Department said the administration will propose to
the 17-nation Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls
(COCOM) that export restrictions be lifted against the Soviet bloc
nations.
   The restrictions are based on multilateral agreements, but the
allies generally follow the United States lead in these matters.
   The COCOM committee, based in Paris, consists of Australia,
Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, West Germany, Greece,
Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain,
Turkey and the United States.
   The committee is scheduled to take up the question this week.
   Although restrictions will remain on some sophisticated computers
and the portable ``laptop'' computers, Cheney said would prefer that
exports be permitted for only ``a lower level of technology.''
   ``My concern is that it will give them a computer capability that
has military applications. That should be avoided,'' the secretary
said.
   He said he disagreed with allowing the East bloc to obtain
computers with a higher data processing rate and storage capacity.
   ``The reason we have the COCOM is to make sure you don't transfer
militarily sensitive or significant information or tech, and my
concern is that I'm not satisfied that we are protecting that
technology under that decsion,'' Cheney said.
   The Commerce Department said there were about 6 million
AT-compatible desk top personal computers sold worldwide by U.S.
companies in 1988. Of those, 2.7 million valued at than $1 billion
were sold outside the United States.

   Polaroid Corp. reported Wednesday that
earnings rose nearly $18 million in the second quarter, despite
costs associated with fighting off hostile suitor Shamrock Holdings.
   The Cambridge-based film and camera manufacturer said it spent $2
million in battling Shamrock during the quarter.
   For the quarter, earnings totaled $42.7 million, or 62 cents a
share, on revenue of $91.9 million, compared with earnings of $24.8
million, or 40 cents a share, on revenue of $45.7 million a year
earlier.
   Earlier this year, Polaroid successfully fought off a $3.1
billion takeover bid by investor Roy E. Disney's Shamrock Holdings.
   Polaroid also reported that revenues from instant film and
videotape sales increased during the quarter, and it expanded the
distribution of the company's conventional film line, Polaroid
OneFilm, which was introduced in April.

   Allied-Signal Inc.'s profit
increased 12 percent during the second quarter, the high technology
and automotive products company reported Wednesday.
   Earnings for the quarter were $166 million, or $1.11 a share,
compared with $128 million, or 85 cents a share, during the same
period in 1988.
   Included in the 1989 second-quarter figure is a one-time gain of
$23 million, or 16 cents a share, Allied-Signal received from an
insurance settlement awarded to Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc.
Allied-Signal has a 40 percent equity interest in Union Texas.
   Sales during the second quarter totaled $3.1 billion, up from $3
billion in the 1988 perioed, Allied said.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Edward L. Hennessy Jr. said the
company's strong performance was aided by the improved showing of
the company's operating units, particularly its aerospace sector.
   ``Earnings are expected to remain strong through the second half
of 1989 as we continue to concentrate on improving our operating
performance,'' Hennessy said.
   Allied-Signal's other business sectors are automotive products
and engineered materials.

<HEAD>Lorenzo Says Eastern Not Moving To Atlanta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern Airlines parent
Texas Air Corp., says the Miami-based airline is staying put,
despite speculation that he was considering moving its headquarters
to Atlanta.
   Atlanta is Eastern's largest hub, and a chief rival, Delta Air
Lines, is based here.
   Lorenzo said previously he would not rule out a move, but he told
a news conference Wednesday there is virtually no chance Eastern
would be coming to Atlanta.
   ``Eastern has an attractive physical setup in Miami. Miami has
been an important part of Eastern for many years. Many of the
families of headquarters' employees are located in Miami,'' he said.
   The airline is trying to rebuild amid a 4-month-old strike by
Machinists union members, pilots and flight attendants, and
increasing the number of flights at Atlanta has been the centerpiece
of that effort.

<HEAD>Feds Stop Allegedly Fraudulent Sales By Maine Company</HEAD>

   A judge has halted sales by a Maine
company that made up to $30 million over the past five years by
allegedly bilking thousands of investors nationwide and in Canada, a
Federal Trade Commission attorney said Wednesday.
   Case Equipment Co. of Turner is accused in an FTC lawsuit of
advertising a ``sublicolor'' printing system that the company said
could be used to print high-quality color pictures on T-shirts and
other consumer items. In reality, the investors were getting nothing
more than an outdated mimeograph machine, FTC attorney Sara
Greenberg said.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Gene Carter issued a temporary
restraining order to stop the sale of the press through next
Wednesday. The FTC will ask Friday for an injunction that would stop
the sales until the matter is resolved in court, Ms. Greenberg said
from her office in Boston.
   Separately, a group of customers who say they were cheated have
filed a lawsuit against Case Equipment in U.S. District Court.
   Potential investors were lured by national magazine
advertisements, flown into Portland and picked up at the airport by
limousines that took them to Case Equipment's showroom in Turner,
Ms. Greenberg said.
   There the investors were shown impressive samples of printing and
given a sales pitch that said making money with the ``sublicolor''
system would be easy, and that Case Equipment had service centers
around the country and long lists of potential customers, Ms.
Greenberg said.
   ``It's a wine 'em and dine 'em sort of operation, and the people
are impressed,'' Ms. Greenberg said. ``Even people who had some
knowledge of the printing industry were taken in.''
   A Case Equipment brochure entered into the court record claims
that investors could have the potential of making ``$93,000 a month
or $1,116,000 a year.''
   Ms. Greenberg alleged that the scam cheated ``somewhere between
2,000 and 4,000 people, multiplied by a minimum of $10,000 each. We
estimated up to $30 million in court papers.''
   Case Equipment had been operating in Turner since 1984, shortly
after its owner, Anthony J. Casella, also known as A.J. Casella and
A.J. Case, abandoned a similar operation in Massachusetts when that
state's attorney general's office began investigating complaints,
Ms. Greenberg said.
   Casella was not available for comment at Case Equipment's office
on Wednesday afternoon, according to an employee who asked a
reporter whether the company's legal troubles were so serious that
he should leave his job.
   ``I'm scared,'' the employee said. ``I'm just wondering what's
going to happen.''
   Casella did not return a telephone message left by The Associated
Press.
   Ms. Greenberg said that the FTC is seeking to stop Casella's
company from misrepresenting its products, and it wants restitution
for all the investors.
   The lawsuit filed by Case Equipment customers seeks compensatory
and punitive damages.
