<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes destroyed a guerrilla base in
south Lebanon 21 miles north of the Israeli border Monday, the army
said.
   All planes returned safely from the early morning raid, a
military statement said.
   An army spokesman said the planes struck a guerrilla base in the
village of Majdal Balhis, about three miles east of Mashghara. The
spokesman, who is not identified under military regulations, would
not say which militia operated the base nor give the reason for the
raid.
   The air raid follows attacks Wednesday and Thursday in which
Katyusha rockets were fired at Israel's Galilee district from south
Lebanon. The attacks caused no injuries, but one rocket damaged a
house in Kiryat Shmona in the Galilee Panhandle.
   Israeli authorities blamed that rocket attack on the militant
Shiite Moslem militia Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Also on Thursday, Israeli troops fought a battle with four
guerrillas just north of the border, and one member of the Shiite
militia Amal was killed. Israel suffered no casualties in the
firefight.
   The air attack was the the 10th time Israeli war planes have
struck in Lebanon this year. The last raid, on Aug. 27, was aimed at
a Hezbollah base.

   Virgilio Godoy Reyes brings solid
political experience and a controversial personality to the campaign
for which he is running as opposition vice presidential candidate in
next February's election.
   While crowds at the headquarters of the National Opposition Union
on Saturday night cheered Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the
presidential candidate, hecklers three times shouted the name of
Godoy's rival for the No. 2 spot.
   While perhaps not an auspicious start for a political candidate,
Godoy's strong personality _ which some have described as arrogant
and abrasive _ can take the heckling.
   The hostility stems from his four-year, eight-month tenure as
Labor Minister under the leftist Sandinista government, against
which he is running now. As Labor Minister, Godoy instituted a
system of salary levels that became widely unpopular. Detractors say
his government post also makes his allegiance to the opposition
somewhat suspect.
   Godoy was Labor Minister from July 19, 1979 to March 31, 1984,
when he resigned. He said later that he quit because he disagreed
with the leftist Sandinista ideology. His resignation however
reflects his political talent _ the government gave him a going-away
reception, showing he must have left in good stead.
   The 55-year-old lawyer has been better at defending himself from
power plays within his own party, the Independent Liberals, than in
attacking the Sandinistas.
   Political attacks against Godoy stem not only from his
personality as from his tenure as president of the Independent
Liberal Party for 10 years. One critic, who prefered to remain
unidentified, called Godoy ``dictatorial and Machiavellian.''
   Godoy follows a long tradition of Liberalism in his family. His
grandfather, Gen. Paulino Godoy, was the spearhead of the
Nicaragua's Liberal revolution of 1983.
   He has said that the slogan of the French revolution, ``Liberty,
Equality, Brotherhood,'' encapsules the most important concepts for
the individual and society.
   Godoy is married to Sonia Perez Mercado, a Mexican; they have
three children.

   A World War II vintage fighter crashed into a
house shortly after takeoff from Santa Monica Airport on Saturday,
injuring the pilot and a passenger, authorities said.
   The house was heavily damaged but no one was at home and no one
on the ground was injured when the single-engine P-51 crashed about
5:45 p.m., said Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells. There was no
fire, he said.
   The pilot reported engine trouble and was trying to return to the
airport when he crashed, said a Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer who declined to identify himself.
   The 56-year-old pilot and a 19-year-old woman passenger were
taken to a hospital where they were being examined, said a nursing
supervisor.
   The P-51 was one of the main fighter planes used by the Allies
during World War II.

<HEAD>Panda Cub Dies At National Zoo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The latest cub born to the giant panda
Ling-Ling died from complications caused by infections it developed
either during or after birth, a National Zoo spokesman said Sunday.
   The female cub, born to Ling-Ling on Friday, was found dead early
Sunday, said chief zoo spokesman Robert Hoage.
   The cub was believed to have contracted the infection either
while it was still in its mother's womb, or shortly after it was
delivered.
   All of Ling-Ling's previous cubs have died. Had this one
survived, it would be the first giant panda successfully bred in the
United States.
   The 4-ounce female cub was confined to an oxygen-filled incubator
since late Friday, and was fed a milk-like formula through a tube
that was inserted down the throat and into the stomach.
   She was also innoculated with immunoglobins that had been
prepared from the blood of her father, Hsing-Hsing, and given
special formula antibiotics.
   Ling-Ling was known to have urinary and reproductive tract
infections, Hoage said.
   The cub was the fifth that Ling-Ling had given birth to while in
captivity. None of them had survived as long as the latest one.
   One of the cubs was born stillborn and the other three died
shortly after birth. Previously Ling-Ling's longest-lived cub was
born in 1987 and lived about 40 hours before dying, possibly because
of the same infection that took the life of her most recent
offspring, Hoage said.
   Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing were given to the United States by the
Chinese government during President Nixon's visit to China in 1972.
Since that time they have mated on numerous occasions, but Ling-Ling
has only given birth four times.

<TEXT>
   Rioting broke out early Sunday in this
resort city, and more than 100 downtown stores were looted and at
least two people shot before a National Guard military police
attachment was deployed, authorities said.
   Diane Roche, assistant director of public information for
Virginia Beach, said guardsmen were called out by Gov. Gerald L.
Baliles shortly after 4 a.m. to assist local authorities. She did
not have exact figures on the number of guardsmen involved.
   She said the rioting began around 2 a.m. when police confronted a
mob on Atlantic Avenue, the main beachfront thoroughfare.
   She had no estimate on the crowd size or what may have set off
the rioting.
   City Manager Aubrey V. Davis ordered much of the resort strip
closed, and residents were told to avoid the area.
   An estimated more than 25,000 college students from predominantly
black schools up and down the East Coast are in town for the annual
Greekfest. Roche said she didn't know if the riot was related to the
gathering.
   Police reported at least four injuries, including the two men
shot. Roche was unable to identify any of the injured or say what
their condition was. She said police officers were not involved in
the shootings.
   Police reported scattered gunfire and several fires in the area
overnight.
   Davis said police, backed by state troopers and the National
Guard, were in ``crowd control positions'' in the oceanfront area.
   At 7 a.m., the area was reported quiet.
   Brenda Kanz, front desk manager at the Kona Kai Motel, said
authorities were not allowing anyone to leave the hotel ``even for
breakfast'' unless they were checking out to go home. Many college
students were staying at the motel, and they remained in their rooms
while guardsmen and police patrolled the streets, she said.
   ``It's a heck of a way to end the season,'' she said.
   Dan Bremer, desk clerk at the Kona Kai East two blocks away, said
some families were checking out of the motel early. He said cash
registers from nearby stores had been hurled into the street by
looters.
   ``It's pretty messy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Bloomingdale's, the lavish department store that
New York's conspicuous consumers know as Bloomies, will open two
shops in Moscow next year, Soviet newspapers reported Sunday.
   Bloomingdale's began capitalizing on ``Gorbymania'' in the United
States by selling Soviet goods in its New York store in May.
   But the opening of two shops in Moscow would be more significant,
given the market-oriented reforms aimed at filling the nation's
store shelves.
   The newspaper Moscow Pravda said Bloomingdale's and the Moscow
City Council signed a letter of intent for the joint venture
bringing the stores to the capital. They are to open in January, the
paper said.
   In its report on the venture, the newspaper Pravda noted that the
New York store sells Soviet products in a special ``perestroika''
department, a reference to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform
program.
   The brief articles did not say whether the two Moscow shops would
accept Soviet rubles or limit their sales to hard currency, which
ordinary Soviets are prohibited from possessing.

<HEAD>Former President Carter is Host to Ethiopian Talks This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Carter, in the mode of his Camp
David triumph, is staging talks this week between the Ethiopian
government and Eritrean rebels on the 28-year-old war that has
killed hundreds of thousands.
   Ten years ago, Carter brokered the Camp David peace agreement
between Israel and Egypt. The sessions beginning Thursday have a
more modest goal: getting the two sides to sit down together.
   ``In the history of political affairs, the most significant
single step is the first meeting,'' Carter said last month in
announcing the talks.
   Previous attempts have failed to arrange talks between the
Ethiopian government and the well-organized, heavily armed rebels
fighting for independence for their province. But Carter, during a
July visit to the East African nation, said the opportunity for
peace has never been better.
   The war has turned more than 1 million people into refugees. It
has drained the Ethiopian economy, contributed to the suffering from
famine and drought and led the government to bring in Soviet and
Cuban military aid.
   The two sides now have agreed that Carter should act as a neutral
observer for the preliminary talks, which the participants say they
hope will lead to more substantive meetings.
   Neither Ethiopian leader Mengistu Haile Mariam nor Isaias
Afwerki, general secretary of the Eritrean People's Liberation
Front, will attend the meetings at the Carter Center. The center,
opened in 1986, houses the Carter presidential library and museum as
well as a think tank, a conference center and offices of foundations
devoted to peace and public health.
   Carter Center officials will not disclose the size of the
negotiating teams, where the groups will stay or security plans. The
meetings will be closed, and no one knows how long they will last.
   Dayle E. Powell, the Carter Center's director of conflict
resolution programs, said extensive efforts have been made to ensure
the negotiators feel comfortable during their stay.
   ``Not just their physical comfort, but the feeling of
neutrality,'' she said. ``We are making every effort to provide for
them a congenial environment in every aspect.''
   For example, Carter Center personnel are careful not to term the
Ethiopian-Eritrean conflict a ``civil war,'' which Ms. Powell said
implies support for the government's view of the struggle as a
conflict within a single state.
   Eritrean guerrillas, which share some Marxist principles with the
Ethiopian government, believe their province at the northern tip of
Ethiopia, with 3.5 million people, should be an independent nation.
   An ancient Ethiopian kingdom, Eritrea has been ruled by the
Ottoman Turks, the Italians and, finally, the British during World
War II before becoming part of a federation with Ethiopia after the
war. Fighting broke out between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1961 and
Ethiopia annexed Eritrea in 1962.
   Eritrea has long been coveted territory because its location on
the Red Sea gives Ethiopia its only ports.
   Mengistu came to power after the 1974 ouster of Emperor Haile
Selassie, who had ruled since 1930. With the change in power came an
increase in the Soviet presence in Ethiopia and the withdrawal,
during the Carter administration, of U.S. military aid and advisers.
   The United States has continued to provide humanitarian aid. The
Soviet Union recently has directed less attention to Ethiopia.
   A second rebel group, the Tigre People's Liberation Front, took
up arms 14 years ago in a fight for increased autonomy in its
province, which borders Eritrea. It also has made overtures for
peace and accepted Carter as an observer, but that conflict will not
be a part of this week's talks.
   The Ethiopia talks mark the second time this year Carter has been
at the center of an major international event. Last spring he served
as an observer in Panama's elections and then briefed President Bush
on the voting, which he said was rife with fraud.
   Carter plans to play a background role in the Ethiopian talks. He
and his center will serve mainly as a vehicle for bringing the
opposing sides together, according to Ms. Powell.
   Some of the principles of the 1979 Camp David talks can be
applied here, Ms. Powell said. ``What worked at Camp David was that
the parties met on neutral ground,'' she said. ``Neither side had
the upper hand, and a third party was present with a sincere
interest in resolution.''
   Though the Camp David talks lasted 13 days, Israel's Menachem
Begin and Egypt's Anwar Sadat actually met face-to-face for only two
days, Ms. Powell said.
   ``President Carter literally shuttled back and forth,'' Ms.
Powell said. ``We hope that part won't be replicated. We hope
they'll meet in the same room.''

   A latter-day Lady Godiva rode naked on
a horse through this village to protest a company's plan to replace
old stables and farm buildings with luxury housing.
   ``I'm not an exhibitionist. In fact I am terrified,'' said Lyn
Brierly, 42, who made the ride Saturday. ``But if this is what it
takes to save the village then I'd do it again and again until
someone sits up and takes notice.''
   Prudential insurance company, which has owned the village since
World War II, has met strong resistance to the development plans and
is involved in negotiations with the district council and the
Cockington Preservation Society.
   Cockington in southwestern England is a cluster of thatched-roof
houses. It has a pub designed in the 1930s by the architect Sir
Edwin Lutyens.
   Ms. Brierly, a nurse, said she feared the stables were targeted
for development because visitors had complained about horse manure
in the village.
   ``The horses are part and parcel of the village life itself. Ask
anyone about Cockington and they'll immediately think of the
horses,'' she said.
   Her ride was mentioned in several national newspapers.

<HEAD>Red Cross Says Exodus of East Germans to Begin Next Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities this week will begin the
long-awaited exodus of East Germans seeking asylum in West Germany,
Red Cross officials disclosed on Sunday.
   West German Red Cross official Wolfgang Wagner also said
authorities believed East German police have infiltrated the
emergency camps in Hungary that are holding thousands of people
awaiting safe passage to the West.
   ``We reckon that's so, but we're not equipped to do anything
about it,'' he said in response to a question.
   He sought to dampen speculation that the transfer would begin
Sunday, telling reporters the East Germans would leave ``sometime''
this week. Asked what was holding up the exodus, Wagner said:
``We're awaiting word from the West German Embassy.''
   Since vacationing East Germans began crowding the embassy in
Budapest to demand passage to the West in July, the embassy has
declined to comment on the developments.
   While legal travel to the West is difficult for most East
Germans, they have relatively little difficulty getting permission
from their Communist government to visit Hungary, a liberal Soviet
bloc country. More than 1 million have vacationed here annually in
the last few years.
   More than 200,000 East Germans were thought to be in Hungary
before the weekend, and Premier Miklos Nemeth has estimated that up
to 20,000 of them want to go to West Germany.
   A bilateral agreement obliges Hungary to send East Germans trying
to flee to the West back to their homeland. But Hungarian officials
have refused to do so, and their decision to permit the East Germans
to go West has led to tensions with East Berlin.
   It also has resulted in a strengthening of ties with West
Germany, where government officials have praised Hungary's handling
of the problem.
   Karsten Voigt, a senior West German opposition official, last
week called on government officials to provide financial and moral
support for Hungary's reform-minded Communist leaders.
   On Saturday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl appealed to
countrymen to welcome the East Germans, while other officials and
politicians called on the East Berlin leadership to stop the exodus
by introducing reforms.
   Holidaying East Germans, frustrated by political rigidity and
economic stagnation at home, began using Hungary as a springboard to
the West after it started removing barbed wire and other barriers
from its border with Austria in May.
   Since then, more than 6,000 are estimated to have fled to Austria
en route to West Germany, which grants them automatic citizenship
and helps them start new lives by giving them financial and social
aid.
   Others seeking to emigrate first crowded the West German Embassy
in Budapest. With government approval, Hungarian charitable
organizations opened the first camps for East Germans in mid-August,
after the crush of would-be refugees staying in the embassy forced
Bonn to close it.
   Wagner said that 4,000 East Germans had been placed in four camps
and a small boarding house by early Sunday afternoon, following more
than 1,000 new arrivals during the weekend.
   Hundreds more were staying in tents and trailers near the Zanka
camp, about 90 miles southwest of Budapest, said other Red Cross
officials.
   While no official details of plans to move the East Germans had
been made public by Sunday, developments in Austria and West Germany
over the past week indicated they would be moved by rail through
Austria to temporary quarters in Bavaria, the main West German state
bordering Austria.
   In Bavaria Sunday, volunteer workers put the finishing touches on
five tent communities with room for more than 5,000 people. Austrian
rail officials continued to hold up to 50 railway cars ready for
quick movement to border points with Hungary.
   Many of those in the Budapest camps huddled in tents or trailers
to escape occasional showers, while others attended religious
services on camp grounds or in city churches.

<HEAD>Child Care, Minimum Wage Remain at Front of Congress' Domestic Agenda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Areas of social concern _ child care, minimum
wage, parental leave and greater opportunities for the disabled _
will be among the issues facing Congress when it returns this week,
but no one is predicting quick action.
   Child care legislation, the issue that became a focus of the 1988
presidential campaign, has passed the Senate. The bill calls for
direct grants to child care providers and would establish
non-binding federal guidelines.
   But in the House, a companion bill is embroiled in a dispute
between two committees with jurisdiction over it.
   Besides that, House Republicans are pushing the White House plan
_ tax credits for lower- and middle-income parents of children under
age 4 regardless of whether both parents actually work and pay for
outside child care.
   Whether child care legislation passes the House before it
recesses for the year sometime in November is anyone's guess, but
legislative staffers believe if the House does agree on a bill, it
will be one that will be acceptable to the Senate and the White
House.
   The child care issue has been kicking around since 1971 when
President Nixon vetoed legislation similar to that under
consideration now, calling it anti-family. Another bill was
considered by Congress in 1975, but never made it to the president.
   It remains at hot issue, with six of 10 Americans surveyed this
summer in a Washington Post-ABC News Poll saying they think the
federal government should provide child-care assistance to low- and
middle-income families.
   The main disagreement now is between the House Education and
Labor Committee and Ways and Means Committee.
   Basically, the Ways and Means approach is to put money for child
care programs into block grants that go to the states with no
strings attached. The committee already has acted by putting
language on child care into the budget reconciliation bill. That
legislation is the omnibus bill into which all committees are
expected to contribute deficit reduction plans.
   A committee said the markup of the committee's proposal for the
child care bill is scheduled for Thursday and will include an effort
to make it conform to the budget reconciliation proposals.
   The provisions of the bill passed by Education and Labor include:
   _putting more money into Head Start so those programs can run all
day instead of half a day;
   _using public school systems to help care for children over 3
years old;
   _grants to providers for the children of parents who can't afford
the full cost of day care;
   _improving day care quality through training programs.
   While containing the provisions of the Senate bill, the Education
and Labor version goes further.
   As for minimum wage, Congress must reach a compromise with the
White House if there is to be final action.
   After the first attempt at raising the minimum wage fell to a
presidential veto, Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., reintroduced the
very same measure.
   It has been voted out of committee and awaits a full Senate vote,
but staff members say talks are going on with the administration to
determine how it might be changed on the floor in a compromise with
the White House.
   Meanwhile, Rep. Austin J. Murphy, D-Pa., introduced a bill in the
House that would raise the minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.25 by 1991,
the maximum amount acceptable to President Bush.
   But it does not contain a provision demanded by the White House
that would allow employers to pay new workers a less-than-minimum
wage for up to six months.
   The issue of family leave has gained the attention of Congress
and awaits debate on the floor of both the House and the Senate. The
measures would require employers to provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid
leave for family emergencies.
   Another measure that may see its way through Congress this
session is called the Americans with Disabilities Act.
   This bill is considered the most comprehensive civil rights
measure since the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   It would prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities
in private sector employment, public accommodations, transportation,
public services and telecommunications.
   It expected to be on the Senate floor soon with House action
later in the fall.

   In the cocaine capital of the world,
the new war between the government and traffickers is one of nerves
as well as firepower.
   An industrial city of 2 million, cradled in lush green mountains,
Medellin suffers almost daily bombings and burnings by the henchmen
of drug bosses in a war that began with the Aug. 18 assassination of
a presidential candidate.
   But bloodshed since that killing has been limited to unlucky
bystanders in the past two weeks. Property, not people, has been the
principal target, fear the main weapon.
   The city continues to function, its shops opening each day and
its workers and businessmen filling the streets, factories and
offices. But fear and tension is pervasive.
   ``There's no direct confrontation, but instead subversive actions
... sporadic and surprising,'' Mayor Juan Gomez Martinez said.
``It's harder to combat them than in a regular war.''
   The government has arrested thousands of people and seized
hundreds of millions of dollars in assets since it declared a
crackdown on drug kingpins on the same day presidential hopeful Luis
Carlos Galan was assassinated. Drug traffickers have responded with
more shootings and bombings.
   In response to the traffickers' campaign of terror, Martinez last
week imposed a strict 10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. citywide curfew. He concedes
that the measure was as much psychological as tactical.
   ``The curfew is not just to prevent the attacks, the bombs,'' he
told foreign reporters at a news conference. ``It's also so that the
entire community knows that we have a problem.''
   For a city like Medellin, it's a drastic measure. The townspeople
are known for a kind of restless joy of life and the night has
always been vibrant, with the bars and dance halls full of loud
music and people, drinking shots of the licorice-flavored local
``aguardiente.''
   For the moment, the party's over.
   At 10 p.m. the city's 4,000 police aided by thousands of army
soldiers take over the streets, armed with automatic and
semi-automatic rifles. They round up curfew violators at gunpoint,
hustling them down the streets to gathering points and packing them
into city dumptrucks headed for a volleyball arena.
   Most of the violators are ill-dressed, sometimes barefoot drunks
and tramps, as well as male and female prostitutes. Many stumble and
sway, their eyes glazed by cheap alcohol. They yell and whistle
derisively at their military guards, creating a din in the
tin-roofed arena.
   The violators are held until the curfew ends at 6 a.m. Those
found to have criminal charges pending are shipped to the police
jailhouse. The rest are set free.
   ``This is just what the city needed. Now there are no more
wounded, there are no more dead at night,'' said an army officer.
``Now the people can sleep in peace.''
   But real peace has remained elusive. The morning after the curfew
first took effect Wednesday, a bomb strapped to a juice vendor's
bicycle blew up in broad daylight. Several people were injured.
   ``It hasn't stopped people from going outdoors, but when you do
go out you always carry a fear that something will happen while
you're passing by,'' said Rubiela Toro, a Medellin housewife.
   So far, the traffickers' targets in Medellin have been political
or economic: political party offices, statesmen's homes and country
clubs, banks and factories have been bombed or burned.
   In recent days they've been seeking a truly big bang, evidently
to further fray the stretched nerves of the community.
   They set up rockets to fire at a liquor plants' huge tanks of
alcohol, but police interrupted the attempt. They fired rockets at
gasoline storage tanks but missed.
   On Thursday, the bomb attached to the bicycle was placed outside
the country's largest paint factory, and according to a company
source, inside were 3,000 gallons of highly explosive nitroglycerin.
   ``If that bomb went off 30 yards down the street, half of
Medellin would have blown up,'' said the source, who spoke on
condition he not be identified.
   On Saturday, the traffickers took the battle to Bogota, setting
off a powerful bomb outside the offices of the daily newspaper El
Espectador.
   Since Medellin was founded in 1616 by Spanish immigrants, its
people have developed a repution for being keen traders and
industrious entrepreneurs. But since the drug underworld emerged in
the 1960s, dealing first in marijuana and now primarily in cocaine,
that reputation has been sullied by gangland violence.
   Bloodshed reached new horrific heights in the last 18 months,
with an underground war between the Medellin cartel and that of the
southeastern city of Cali for control of the $1 billion New York
market. A Medellin journalist said that up until the curfew, which
put the feud on ice, his newspaper was reporting an average of six
killings a day.
   The traffickers also have killed the provincial governor and
police commander as well as scores of Medellin judges in a
successful effort to avoid arrest.
   Judges and law enforcement officials are known to receive threats
in the most terrible forms, such as a mutilated photograph of their
children.
   The traffickers' new aim is to get the government to end its
nationwide crackdown and agree to negotiations. The government, so
far, has categorically rejected the suggestion.
   Mayor Gomez, however, favors talks with the cocaine barons and
sees them as inevitable. ``No one knows when the war is going to
end,'' he said. ``But I think it's going to end at the negotiating
table.''

<TEXT>
   She was once ``the most dangerous woman
in America.'' For close to half a century, coal miners from West
Virginia to Colorado knew her as a fiery champion of organized labor
in an era when picket lines were often met with bayonets.
   Today, memories of Mary Harris ``Mother'' Jones have faded even
in the coal-mining country where she is buried in the only
union-owned cemetery in the nation. But a handful of labor activists
and scholars want to ensure she is more than a footnote to the
history of the labor movement.
   ``She serves as kind of an inspiration to workers who won't be
satisfied until they are on an equal plane, in control of their
destiny,'' said labor historian Ralph Stone of Sangamon State
University in Springfield, which holds an annual Mother Jones
commemoration.
   From the 1870s almost until her death in 1930, her white-haired,
grandmotherly figure was in the thick of some of the nation's most
bitter labor disputes. At a time when miners bought food from the
company store and slept in company houses on company land, she was a
fierce socialist who once bristled when called a ``great
humanitarian.''
   ``Get it right,'' she retorted. ``I'm not a humanitarian. I'm a
hell-raiser.''
   Her history is a litany of clashes with police, prosecutors and
government authorities, most of whom she saw as tools of the
``high-class burglars'' who owned mines and factories. The
authorities saw her as a subversive of the worst kind.
   ``There sits the most dangerous woman in America,'' a West
Virginia prosecutor said of her in the early 1900s. ``She crooks her
finger _ 20,000 contented men lay down their tools and walk out.''
   Historians say Mother Jones was given to rewriting her own
history, and indisputable facts about her early life are few. An
Irish immigrant trained as a teacher, she lived briefly in Chicago
but settled in Memphis, Tenn., in the 1860s. She married an
ironworker who was an active union member, and had three children.
   Her husband and children died in an 1867 epidemic of yellow
fever, and the young widow moved back to Chicago, where she worked
as a dressmaker and was drawn into union work.
   Despite nearly 60 years as a labor organizer _ she was, by her
reckoning, 100 years old at her death in 1930 _ her tangible legacy
is limited, in part because of her distaste for institutions. Though
closely associated with the United Mine Workers, she feuded with
some of its best-known leaders, such as John L. Lewis.
   The miners union gave her permission to organize, but she never
held office, Stone said. It is also unclear how she made the leap
from dressmaking to the coal fields.
   ``She wasn't an administrator, she wasn't a functionary,'' Stone
said. ``She suffered the bureaucrats very poorly. ... She would be
just as upset today as she was in 1910 or 1920, and she'd be upset
in some ways with the labor unions.''
   Years before her death she requested burial in Mount Olive, about
40 miles northeast of St. Louis, in a cemetery bought by miners as a
resting place for four comrades killed in the Virden Massacre, an
1898 clash between striking workers and mine guards in a nearby
town. For years, Mother Jones' tomb was the site of an annual
pilgrimage.
   ``They would have speakers, prominent labor people, thousands of
visitors,'' says Viola Krivi, a coal miner's daughter who as a
10-year-old filed past the tomb. ``You couldn't walk down the
sidewalk, the streets were so crowded.''
   The annual tributes stopped as many of the area's mines shut down.
   Some of the tradition has been revived in recent years with the
Mother Jones Dinner at Sangamon State that includes a pilgrimage to
the gravesite. It is held the second Saturday in October.
   ``In the last 10 years she has started to get some attention, but
until the '70s she was pretty much neglected,'' Stone said. ``It's
true not only in Illinois but in most of the country.'' One reason
she is better known now is the existence of the 13-year-old San
Francisco-based magazine Mother Jones, a liberal journal best known
for its expose on the problems of the Ford Pinto.
   Today, a hand-lettered sign along Interstate 55 guides visitors
to Mother Jones' grave, a 22-foot edifice of pink granite that
towers over a one-acre cemetery bordered by cornfields.
   ``The resting place of real union people,'' reads a sign hanging
from a wrought-iron arch over the cemetery gate.

   Thousands of blacks marched,
picnicked and waded at a ``whites-only'' beach Sunday. Police made
58 arrests, but waited more than two hours before breaking up the
protest.
   The crowd, estimated at 5,000 to 10,000, stretched for more than
a mile along the shore, the biggest beach protest ever in South
Africa.
   Organizers claimed a victory over segregation and vowed further
acts of protest during a nationwide defiance campaign.
   Several dozen whites, some carrying whips and wearing ``whites
only'' T-shirts, yelled abuse as the throng paraded along the
segregated sections of South Africa's most heavily used beachfront.
Other sections of the hotel-lined shore have been opened to all
races in recent years.
   One angry white man barged into the crowd, yelling and pushing,
but police said they could control the situation on their own. Some
whites yelled to the officers, ``Shoot them dead.''
   At one point, police arrested about 10 black youths who unfurled
a flag of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
They remained in custody late Sunday, but police said the other 48
people arrested during the course of the protest were released after
a few hours.
   The police contingent of several hundred officers was equipped
with shot guns and a water cannon, but they made no efforts to stop
the protesters from moving onto segregated Addington Beach.
   In contrast, police used clubs and whips and arrested 500 people
Saturday in Cape Town while breaking up a planned protest march to
Parliament.
   White lifeguards remained at their posts during the beach protest
and white surfers continued to paddle off the shore while black
children splashed nearby.
   After about 2{ hours, police officers announced that the protest
was illegal and began moving the crowd away.
   At a news conference later, protest leaders said they considered
the event a success.
   ``It's the dawn of a new age,'' said the Rev. Stanley Mogoba, a
prominent Methodist leader.
   More than 1,300 people, including prominent activists such as
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, have been arrested since Wednesday
in connection with the defiance campaign. Most have been released
pending possible court action.
   The defiance campaign began Aug. 2 and has intensified steadily
in the days leading to Wednesday's segregated parliamentary
elections, which exclude the black majority.
   A two-day national protest _ probably including a general strike
_ is planned for Tuesday and Wednesday by major anti-apartheid
groups.
   The majority of the beach protesters were youths, many wearing
yellow caps with the slogan ``Free the Beaches.'' The crowd included
many Indians and some whites as well as blacks.
   Local police officials had warned activists last week that the
protest could trigger violence, and some roadblocks were set up in
an attempt to keep protesters away from the beach.
   Police reported that several small bombs exploded Friday night in
trash bins along the beachfront. Near the bins, pamphlets
purportedly written by white right-wing extremists warned activists
not to proceed with the protest.
   Previous targets of the defiance campaign have included
segregated hospitals, schools and buses. Many activists have defied
restrictions imposed on them following their release from detention,
and several banned organizations have declared that they were
resuming operations.
   Protesters were whipped by police at a defiance protest at a
whites-only beach near Cape Town on Aug. 19. At least two Cabinet
ministers of the governing National Party have expressed regret for
that incident, but the government has given no public indication
that it is ready to make major changes in remaining segregation laws.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

   Striking Eastern Airlines employees, coal
miners and phone workers are the symbol of both the uncertainty and
solidarity the American labor movement reflects on this Labor Day.
   In an extraordinary year, labor has suffered some major losses
yet won some impressive victories, although the spotlight on the
negatives has tended to obscure the bright spots.
   A number of unions have proven that labor-management cooperation
can work but, as in the case of the United Auto Workers, learned as
well that too much of a ``good'' thing can prove troublesome.
   Others have found hope in their solidarity _ particularly in the
Eastern and miners' strikes _ but will spend labor's traditional
holiday wondering if their jobs are the price they will pay for
their pride and determination.
   The movement has lost one nemesis, Ronald Reagan, but gained
another, Frank Lorenzo.
   Union workers here can take pride in remarkable developments in
Poland _ their dues helped support the Solidarity trade union from
its underground days to its historic rise as leader of the first
non-communist government in the East bloc. Through the AFL-CIO, U.S.
unions funneled thousands of dollars worth of printing equipment and
other supplies to Solidarity while it was outlawed.
   ``I think the role of the American trade union movement in this
should not be overlooked,'' AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said
last week.
   Kirkland, head of the 14-million member AFL-CIO, the major
umbrella group for the nearly 18 million Americans who belong to
unions, says those who are eulogizing the labor movement don't
understand it.
   ``The key to any evaluation of the labor movement ought to
examine what we regard as the most important measure and that is
internal cohesiveness and solidarity,'' he said. ``And I think it's
fair to say that we do have a higher degree of solidarity and
cohesion today than we've had in many, many years.''
   A number of developments bolster Kirkland's point. Among them:
   _The virtually unprecedented support of the pilots' union when
the Machinists union struck Eastern on March 4.
   _Joint negotiations between former enemies, the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, with AT&amp;T and the ``baby Bell'' regional telephone
companies. That solidarity continued in a number of strikes against
the regional companies.
   _Nationwide wildcat strikes to support 1,700 miners who struck
Pittston Coal Group after lengthy and bitter negotiations failed to
bring a settlement. Pittston is seeking to halt its contributions to
union pension funds, a move that likely would cause other companies
to follow suit.
   Still, there have been setbacks for labor as well.
   A trickle of defections among union pilots turned into a steady
flow that has allowed Eastern _ and Lorenzo _ to move ahead with
plans to reorganize the carrier as a smaller, non-union airline.
Labor still hopes to use Congress and bankruptcy court to oust
Lorenzo but its chances appear slim as the strike reaches the
six-month mark on Labor Day.
   The most highly publicized failure of ``Big Labor'' was the Auto
Workers' defeat in an election at a Nissan plant in Smyrna, Tenn.,
its first attempt to organize a U.S. plant fully owned by the
Japanese.
   At Nissan, and at other industries that traditionally have been
the backbone of trade unions, the labor movement is running into two
main obstacles: management programs to undermine union support by
giving workers more say and perks, and intricate anti-union
campaigns to defeat organizing drives including screening applicants
to determine their attitudes toward unions.
   At Smyrna, Nissan screened more than 100,000 workers for about
3,000 jobs.
   But Kirkland said the Japanese aren't to blame for doing that.
   ``They are led into this course in some cases not by anything
inherent in their culture or their own countries, because in many
instances they have a history of dealing with trade unions in their
own countries with good faith, but are following the advice of
hustlers, American hustlers, who have made a new profession out of
trying to guide employers for a fee,'' Kirkland said.
   To counter such tactics, labor is changing the way it looks at
organizing and now accepts as ``associate members'' workers at
plants where organizing efforts failed and immigrant workers looking
for residency status in the United States.
   By getting its foot in the door, and offering those workers
benefits such as cut-rate credit cards, insurance and legal
services, unions hope to foster goodwill that will bring success in
later elections.
   Such a concept, once reviled by traditionalists in the movement,
has brought in 300,000 associate members in the past three years
and, according to Kirkland and other federation officials, is
beginning to pick up steam.
   The federation also is now stepping in to avoid most fighting
among unions by deciding which affiliate should get the chance at
non-union companies targeted for organizing. And the affiliates are
making fresh efforts at attracting women, minorities and workers in
the growing service sector.
   The noisy year for labor has to some degree obscured some
remarkable contract agreements.
   The Steelworkers union won back many of the concessions workers
were forced to give earlier in the decade when the industry was
nearly crippled.
   The CWA and IBEW came out of the AT&amp;T talks and the regional
negotiations settled so far with contracts that include innovative
packages of parental leave, elder care and child care benefits.
   And UAW workers at a joint Chrysler-Mitsubishi plant in Illinois
last week agreed on a new contract believed to have the best
job-protection provisions ever included in a major industrial
contract.
   In the final months of 1989 the Eastern strike and legislative
initiatives are likely to dominate labor's agenda.
   Pending on Capitol Hill are efforts to raise the minimum wage and
a number of other labor-backed measures, including expanded child
care benefits and a number of bills designed to curb mergers and
acquisitions. Also pending, but unlikely to pass, is a measure
designed to force President Bush to intervene in the Eastern strike.
   Kirkland refers to Bush as ``Reagan Lite,'' sharing his former
boss' pro-management bent but not his virulent anti-union philosophy.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said Sunday the Bush
administration was striving to maintain close contact with the
organized labor leadership.
   ``We talk at least once a week with the AFL-CIO,'' she said.
   Appearing on CNN's ``Newsmaker Sunday'' program, Mrs. Dole noted
that ``what I have been very pleased to see _ and we're urging a
continuation of this approach _ is cooperation between management
and labor.''
   ``That trend has been occurring over the last 10 years. It's very
important that it continue, if we're going to become ever more
competitive on a global basis _ that there not be so much
confrontation and more cooperation between management and labor,''
she said.
   Even though Bush is regarded as no friend of the labor movement,
he is not seen as its No. 1 enemy, as was Reagan.
   That designation has been passed to Lorenzo, who was successful
in making Continental Airlines a non-union carrier and appears on
the verge of winning again at Eastern.
   His recent talk of selling Continental has sparked hope in the
labor movement that the airline unions might yet pull a victory out
of defeat.
   Kirkland said there will be no winners even if the carrier
returns to the union fold. But his contempt for Lorenzo was clearly
evident as he added a caveat.
   ``Scorched earth on both sides is not a victory,'' he said. ``Of
course it's better than scorched earth on just one side.''

   Heavy air force and artillery
bombardments by the Afghan army have failed to break rebel control
of a strategic post near the border city of Khost, government
officials and diplomats said Sunday.
   But the major assault by U.S.-backed rebels against the city
appears to have stalled, they said.
   Also Sunday, the Afghan Foreign Ministry issued a statement
criticizing the United States for continuing to arm the
Pakistani-based rebels, saying it underscored an American desire for
war in Afghanistan.
   Government sources and diplomats said the assault on Khost, which
began 10 days ago, was aimed at gaining recognition from the
non-aligned summit that begins in Belgrade, Yugoslavia on Monday.
President Najib said in a statement released Sunday that he would
seek special backing for his peace proposals at the conference.
   In the Khost fighting, government sources said the Afghan troops
had recaptured three posts but still were trying to take four more
fortified positions lost in earlier fighting.
   The most strategic of those was at Daragai, 10 miles south of the
city, because it controls the main supply routes between Pakistan
and the capital.
   The provincial capital, just 18 miles from the Pakistani border,
is considered the most vulnerable to rebel assault because supply
lines are so short.
   ``We have felt a lot of pressure in the last week,'' said one
government official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The
threat has diminished, but their effort has not collapsed.''
   The guerrillas issued a statement Saturday in Pakistan saying the
Afghan army had failed to take the position at Daragai.
   The official described the fighting around the city as
``serious.''
   He said Khost remained secure because the strategic routes into
the city were heavily mined. The government supplies its troops by
air because the road to the capital has long been controlled by the
rebels.
   Government troops also have been fighting rebel assaults around
the city of Jalalabad, 120 miles east of the capital, and in the
southeastern province of Kandahar, the officials said.
   Kabul was quiet a day after rocket attacks killed 16 and injured
52.
   The Afghan Foreign Ministry issued its criticism of the United
States in response to remarks made Thursday in Pakistan by Peter
Tomsen, special U.S. envoy to the guerrillas.
   Tomsen said the United States would continue to arm the
guerrillas in their effort to topple the Soviet-backed government in
Kabul. Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also support the rebels.
   Tomsen's statements ``indicate the war-mongering policy of the
United States,'' the statement said.
   The Soviet Union withdrew its 115,000 troops in Afghanistan in
February under a U.N.-sponsored agreement to end the fighting that
started in 1979.
   The rebels formed an interim government but have failed in
repeated efforts to capture a provincial capital to use as its seat.
   The president, speaking to the official agency Bakhtar before his
departure late Saturday, said he would propose that the non-aligned
movement set up a committee to pursue his peace proposals.
   Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are expected to lead the fight against
the committee.
   Najib has proposed negotiating with the rebels in conjunction
with a six month cease-fire to be followed by nationwide elections.

   Expressing unease with the kind of changes sweeping the Soviet

   ``It is not our policy to hasten renovation of the political
system while preparations are still inadequate,'' the Communist
Party leader said. ``Neither is it our intention to effect limitless
democratization.''
   ``The Communist Party of Vietnam is the leader, initiator and
pacesetter in renovation,'' Linh said. ``We shall not allow any
force to set up any opposition party to work against the people and
against socialism. Once again, we declare that we resolutely reject
pluralism, a multi-party system or opposition parties.''
   His comments came in a 10,000-word speech laden with Marxist
terminology and dogma. Linh, an economic reformer who has also taken
some steps toward political liberalization, gave the address at a
meeting in Hanoi on Friday to mark Vietnam's National Day. A text
was seen in Bangkok on Sunday.
   Its basic thrust reflected a recent conservative trend in Hanoi,
with official media lashing out at liberal reform in Hungary and
Poland.
   Some observers believe the trend stems from leaders' fears that
Vietnam's ``open-door'' economic policy will lead to a popular
pro-democracy movement such as occurred in China.
   Others, however, believe the recent conservative declarations are
a tactical ploy by party liberals to appease conservative elements.
   ``Democracy does not mean that one is free to say what one wants
to say, write what one wants to write and do what one wants to do,
no matter what the consequences may be,'' the Communist leader said.
``These are essentially anarchist acts.''
   Linh said that while Vietnam believes in the reform occurring in
some Communist countries, there were ``opposition forces of all
colors which are misusing liberalization and openness to fish in
troubled waters.''
   He accused the United States and other ``imperialists'' of trying
to undermine the Communist camp and launching ``frenzied attacks
against socialism.''
   However, Linh said capitalist-style reforms would continue in
Vietnam. He said the pace of such changes has quickened considerably
since they were first launched two years ago.

<HEAD>Regulators Ponder Reasons for Plants' Sudden Fall From Grace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years ago the Calvert Cliffs nuclear power
plant in Maryland was on a roll. Today, it's on its back and federal
regulators are wondering whether the traumatic tumble is symptomatic
of broader problems in the nuclear industry.
   One concern is that owners of some plants, dissatisfied with the
profit outlook in nuclear energy, are turning too much of their
corporate attention to other businesses _ sometimes taking on
projects far removed from the nuclear field.
   Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric, which owns the Calvert Cliffs station,
denies that its move into new enterprises in the early 1980s,
including ownership of nursing homes, led to the nuclear plant's
decline. It says complacency was its downfall, and that an infusion
of new senior managers will put the plant back on track.
   Whatever the reason, regulators are stunned that a nuclear plant
long considered one of the best in the business could suddenly drop
to near the bottom of the heap.
   Both of Calvert Cliff's nuclear reactors have been closed since
May because of mechanical problems. One may be restarted in October,
the other next spring, although the utility must first get a
go-ahead from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has had the
plant under special surveillance since last winter.
   Calvert Cliffs is not the only source of worry for regulators.
Although the nuclear industry's overall record in safety and
efficiency has been improving lately, the NRC is concerned that
signs of trouble are cropping up unexpectedly at some plants.
   They cite as examples the Surry plant owned by Virginia Power
Co., which last May was hit with a $500,000 fine for violating
Nuclear Regulatory Commission rules _ one of the largest fines ever
imposed by the agency _ and the Salem plant of New Jersey's Public
Service Electric and Gas, which in late August drew especially low
marks in a regular NRC review of its operating performance.
   One of the dilemmas facing regulators is determining when a
dropoff in performance at an individual plant may be serious enough
to force a shutdown. There are no clear guidelines for making this
judgment, officials said.
   The NRC now is mulling the case of the Turkey Point nuclear
station in south Florida, which has been ranked among the worst
performers for three straight years in the commission's biannual
review of operations at all 112 U.S. nuclear plants.
   The commission has repeatedly criticized Turkey Point's
performance, citing, among other things, unstable management by
Florida Power &amp; Light Co., the plant owner. Last June some NRC
officials suggested the commission might force Turkey Point to close
if it didn't show improvement by the end of the year.
   Also, William Russell, administrator of the NRC's Northeast
regional office, said recently he had ``a real concern'' that the
reason for problems at the Nine Mile Point 1 nuclear plant, near
Oswego, N.Y., was a ``diversion of attention'' by its owner, Niagara
Mohawk Power Corp., to its financial troubles.
   The most puzzling case, however, is Calvert Cliffs, which in
August 1987 was inspected by a team from the International Atomic
Energy Agency and given a clean bill of health.
   ``Calvert Cliffs is a good example of what is expected from a
well managed and operated plant,'' the inspectors' report said,
adding that ``no shortcomings in equipment, personnel and operating
practices were found that would compromise safe operation.''
   The report included some mild criticism of the plant's
maintenance and industrial safety training programs, but the overall
judgment was that Calvert Cliffs was above the average of nuclear
plants inspected in other countries.
   Then the trouble began. Last spring and summer, Calvert Cliffs
suffered a series of mishaps and was fined by the NRC for violations
of safety regulations. The toughest blow, however, was an
extraordinary incident last September in which a diver at the plant
drowned in a water storage tank after disregarding safety rules.
   ``That shook them up; it shook us up,'' said Thomas Murley,
director of the NRC's office of nuclear reactor regulation.
   Three months later the plant was put on the NRC's list of
worst-run plants in the country, and this summer it was reaffirmed
on the list.
   ``Their fall from grace came so quickly and they fell so far,
given the good performance that they'd had over the years,'' James
Curtiss, a member of the NRC, said in a meeting with Baltimore Gas &amp;
Electric officials in mid-August.
   Murley says Calvert Cliffs had such a consistently good operating
record in the past that its own managers _ and federal regulators _
may have become complacent.
   ``They had a halo effect for years,'' he said.
   Murley said he is confident that NRC methods of monitoring
nuclear plant performance _ including special on-site audits about
once a year _ are adequate to ensure public safety. But some other
officials have expressed doubt about whether NRC warnings to plant
owners are enough to force improvements.
   ``My problem with (yearly inspections) is they are so late,'' NRC
Chairman Kenneth Carr told a recent commission meeting. ``They come
out so long afterward, the guy can lull himself into saying, `Well,
we fixed that... We are in better shape now.''

   A chain-reaction pileup involving 115
vehicles on a major autobahn injured 26 people on Sunday,
authorities said.
   Police blamed the series of collisions on drivers traveling too
fast during a heavy rainstorm. Four of the victims were seriously
injured.
   The pileup occurred near Allershausen, 30 miles north of Munich,
creating a traffic jam 12 miles long on the autobahn linking
Nuremberg and Munich.
   Police said $445,000 in damage was done to vehicles involved.

<HEAD>At Court's Behest, Four Whites Appear in Black Church to Apologize
for Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ADAIRVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four white people who set fire to a church
founded by freed slaves returned to the newly renovated building to
give their court-ordered apologies to the congregation.
   Bill Sircy, 22, bowed his head and cleared his throat during
Saturday's dedication of the new Smith Grove AME Zion Church, then
said, ``We're sorry, but I know that's not enough.''
   The congregation of about 60 people responded, ``Amen!''
   ``What we did was wrong,'' said Angela B. Estep, whose husband
stood nearby. ``It was an accident, but it was still wrong. And I'm
sorry.''
   As Sherri Davenport, 19, spoke, her grandfather, Herman England
of Adairville, listened from the church doorway. Afterward he said
he was proud of her courage in taking responsibility for her action.
   ``What's done is done; they can't bring it back,'' England said.
``But they did what they could.''
   Danny Smith, 22, echoed that sentiment after the service. ``There
just wasn't a whole lot we could say _ just that we're sorry.''
   The congregation gave the four young people a round of applause
as they left the church.
   ``I think what they did was a fantastic gesture,'' said Sarah
Garrick of Chicago, who grew up near the church.
   ``We are just amazed that this type of thing could happen,'' said
Ms. Garrick, 57. ``When I lived here, this would have never have
happened because of the racial prejudices in the area. I think it's
wonderful that the court made them come out here and apologize.''
   Last October the four young people, all residents of this rural
western Kentucky town, pleaded guilty in Logan District Court to
breaking into the 116-year-old church and setting it on fire in May
1986.
   Before their sentencing, the four had paid $6,000 to rebuild the
church, and prosecutors agreed to amend the charges from felonies to
misdemeanors. But when Logan District Judge Dale L. Prince sentenced
them, he ordered them to apologize to the congregation of face
contempt of court, with possibly a year in jail and a $500 fine.
   Prince also put each of the four on probation for two years.

   Shops, banks and schools closed and
armed police patrolled the streets Sunday during a nationwide strike
called by opposition groups.
   Except for a few rickshaws, the streets of Dhaka and other major
cities were deserted and many government and private offices closed
during the six-hour strike, witnesses said.
   Strike supporters in small groups paraded through downtown Dhaka,
chanting slogans, deflating rickshaw tires and harrassing rickshaw
pullers, witnesses said. At least 16 people were arrested, police
said.
   Baton-wielding police clashed with members of a procession near a
mosque in central Dhaka, police and witnesses said. About 20 people,
including two opposition leaders, were slightly injured, they said.
   In downtown Dhaka, a gasoline bomb was thrown at a jeep taking
two policewomen to work. The jeep exploded and the two women jumped
to the street, police said.
   One officer, an inspector at the department's special
intelligence branch, suffered severe head injuries and was in a
coma, police said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   An eight-party opposition alliance headed by the Awami League
called the strike to protest an Aug. 10 attack by unidentified
gunmen on the home of the Awami League chief Sheikh Hasina.
   No one was injured in the attack, blamed on the Freedom Party
whose leaders plotted the violent 1975 coup that toppled the
government of Mrs. Hasina's father, Sheik Mujibur Rahman.
   Party leaders denied any involvement the attack and called a
strike demanding a ban on the Awami League and its allies.
   Hasina and another opposition leader, Khaleda Zia, have been
leading a 6-year-old campaign against the government of President
Hussain Muhammad Ershad, who seized power in a military coup in
March 1982. They are demanding Ershad's resignation and new
elections.

   Actress Kate Jackson, recovering from
breast surgery and getting ready to make a new movie, has bought a
house here in sight of her childhood home so she can occasionally
get away from it all.
   ``Maybe now more than ever Birmingham is home,'' Miss Jackson
said. ``The people that I love the most are there, and to me that's
what home is.
   ``The surgery was a complete success,'' she said Thursday of the
operation two weeks ago to have a malignancy removed. ``My recovery
has been amazing. I really can't believe I feel so well.
   ``I think it's such an incredible thing that they can do the
reconstructive surgery right at the time, so you don't have to go
through this incredible trauma that I think women had to go through
up until recently,'' she told The Birmingham News in a telephone
interview from California.
   Miss Jackson, who starred in ``The Rookies,'' ``Charlie's
Angles,'' and ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King,'' said when she finishes
the television movie she described as a psychological thriller,
she'll ``come home to Birmingham.''
   ``It's just a sweet little house, nothing grandiose,'' she said.
``One of the best things I like about it is I can look right across
the way to that tiny little house in which my sister and I grew up.
   ``I never imagined I'd be 40 and not have three or four babies
running around the house and a husband and all of that. But I still
hope that that'll happen,'' she said.Her two marriages ended in
divorce.

   Gov. James Blanchard married his
former executive assistant, Janet Fox, among the flowers and
Victorian bric-a-brac of the governor's summer mansion.
   More than 150 tourists who waited in the road for four hours for
a glimpse of the bride and groom applauded as the Blanchards emerged
Saturday to take a horse-drawn carriage built for Queen Victoria to
their dinner reception at the nearby Grand Hotel.
   The wedding was the second for both, but a first for the summer
governor's mansion.
   The crowd applauded as the governor waved and shouted ``Hello,
everybody!'' In her debut as the state's first lady, Mrs. Blanchard
stumbled only once when, unaccustomed to her new name, she
introduced herself as ``Janet Fox.''
   ``Oh no! It's Janet Blanchard now,'' she said.

   Nelson is founder and chairman of Farm Aid Inc., which has raised
$12 million with three concerts to support family farmers in the
United States. He said he intends to continue holding Farm Aid
concerts until the farm crisis is over.
   ``We're here for the duration,'' Nelson said before a non-benefit

   Actress Anjelica Huston reportedly paid nearly
$2 million for Richard Chamberlain's house, which the actor is
giving up to move to Hawaii for his new TV series ``Island Son.''
   But actor Jack Nicholson isn't moving in with her, the Los
Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   ``Miss Huston will live in her new home without Jack Nicholson,
her boyfriend of several years,'' her real estate agent, Joe Coons,
was quoted as saying. ``When I asked her why they lived apart, she
said, `It just works out better that way.'
   ``But they live a stone's throw away from each other.''
   Miss Huston recently finished a movie with Woody Allen and will
attend this month's Emmy Awards ceremonies as a nominee for her role
in the miniseries ``Lonesome Dove.''
   The 3,500-square-foot house near Beverly Hills has two bedrooms,
a maid's quarters and a pool.
   The home was completely remodeled by Chamberlain in an Oriental
motif while he was starring in the TV miniseries ``Shogun.''

<HEAD>Texas Towns Feud Over Super Collider Fame</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The superconducting super collider
project has got three towns on a super collision course over
bragging rights to the giant atom smasher, bringing out their big
artillery on billboards and bumper stickers.
   All three _ Waxahachie, Ennis and Midlothian _ want people to
think of their town first when they think of the collider which is
slated for Ellis County and, in fact, won't touch any of the three.
   The fight isn't quite so heated as the battle that preceded it,
when politicians all over the country sought to get the
multibillion-dollar federal project in their state. Instead, it's a
battle fought with bumper stickers and billboards.
   Ennis proclaims itself ``Super Collider Country'' and Midlothian
boasts it's the ``Gateway to the Super Collider.''
   So far, Waxahachie has smashed the competition. At 18,150 people,
it is the biggest town in Ellis County and will be encircled by the
53-mile collider ring. It calls itself ``The Center of Attention,
Home of the super collider.''
   The other two towns are on the outskirts of the ring, which is to
be built in the country south of Dallas-Fort Worth.
   Shortly after the U.S. Energy Department announced in November
that Ellis County would be the collider site, the Waxahachie Chamber
of Commerce printed hundreds of bumper stickers proclaiming itself
the center.
   The town also rented billboard space off Interstate 35 to carry
the same message.
   That was enough to make officials in Ennis and Midlothian stomp
in protest.
   Ennis, a town of about 14,150 people east of Waxahachie,
countered with its own boast on a billboard on Interstate 45.
   ``The only thing Waxahachie has is its name,'' said Kipp Burnett,
executive vice president of the Ennis Chamber of Commerce. ``It
sticks. Even though it's hard to say, you don't forget it.''
   Bob Sokoll, Waxahachie city manager, scoffs at such talk.
   ``We are not going to let one peon city to the east like Ennis
think they are the home of the super collider,'' Sokoll said. ``The
only thing Ennis does better than us is play football.''
   Midlothian, population 5,000, won't be left out, said Pam Mundo,
executive director of the town's chamber of commerce. She's the one
who came up with the slogan: ``We are the Gateway to the Super
Collider.''
   The Texas National Research Laboratory Commission, the state
agency in charge of acquiring the land for the collider, is shying
away from the feud.
   ``We have tried not to get caught up in the local competition,''
commission spokeswoman Catherine Burns said last week. ``We have
always referred to the super collider as being in Ellis County.''
   Ground has not been broken for the colossal project, but
officials say it should be operational by 1996.
   The collider is expected to reveal new information about the
nature of matter and the origins of the universe. It will hurl
minute beams of protons toward one another inside a 53-mile tunnel.
It is expected to create 4,000 temporary construction jobs and 3,000
permanent positions.

<HEAD>Grosz Rules Out Force By Hungarian Communists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian Communist Party chief Karoly
Grosz promised that the party will not use force to hold onto power
if it loses the nation's first multi-party elections next year, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
   In an interview by the daily Helsingin Sanomat newspaper, Grosz
acknowledged that Hungarian communists want to wield power.
   However, he added that the party would ``draw its own
conclusions'' if it were to lose the elections, due to be held at
the latest in 1990, according to the paper.
   ``We would not be satisfied with such a situation,'' Grosz was
quoted as saying. However, he ruled out using force as a political
weapon, saying, ``We would not use tanks but political arguments to
get back into power.''
   He said he will step down as party general secretary during a
party congress on Oct. 6, but that he would continue to be active in
politics. ``I want to remain in the party leadership,'' he said.
   In Finland, Grosz was scheduled to meet with President Mauno
Koivisto on Monday.
   Grosz's power was diluted in June when party reformers
established a ruling presidium with the general secretary as one of
four members. Party chairman Rezsoe Nyers has described himself as
``first among equals'' on the new body.
   In Hungary on Sunday, the reformers preparing for the party
congress clashed over how far to go in revamping the party.
   Presidium members Imre Pozsgay, Miklos Nemeth, and Nyers spoke at
a two-day conference of reformist communists held to plan strategy
for the October congress.
   Nyers told the nearly 400 delegates that the party's political
and economic policies must be revamped.
   However, Pozsgay went further, calling for a ``Copernican
revolution,'' invoking the Polish astronomer whose discovery that
the earth was round shook conservative-minded colleagues in the 16th
century.
   Nemeth, in comments Saturday, appeared still more radical. He
said ``dyed-in-the-wool Bolsheviks'' who cannot accept far-reaching
reforms should be free to split and form rival parties.
   Party Central Committee Secretary Gyoergy Fejti told a rally
Saturday that 10,000 members a month have been leaving the party in
the recent past. He said only 200 new members had been enrolling
each month.
   Since endorsing the idea of a multi-party democracy in February,
the Hungarian communists suffered upset defeats in three
parliamentary by-elections. The voting represented Hungary's freest
voting in over 40 years.
   Party reformers, who advocate a free-market economy in addition
to a pluralistic political system, hold views that often put them
closer to some non-communist opposition groups than to conservatives
in their own party.

   When President Bush announces his strategy to
combat illegal drugs Tuesday, he'll be striding down a path similar
to one trod 20 years ago by President Nixon. And by presidents
before him.
   In the marijuana smoke-filled days of anti-Vietnam War protests
when ``turn-on, tune-in and dropout'' were the watchwords for much
of a generation, Nixon launched an aggressive law enforcement attack
on drugs.
   He wasn't the first.
   Cocaine and heroin were outlawed by the Harrison Narcotic Act in
1914.
   Marijuana was outlawed in 1937.
   The nation focused on heroin again in the 1950s, two decades
after Prohibition was repealed, and two different versions of the
Boggs Act, passed in 1952 and 1954, called for severe sentences for
drug traffickers.
   President Kennedy convened a White House Conference on Drug Abuse
in 1963.
   Now, top government officials are talking of the possibility of
U.S. troops fighting drug lords in a foreign land.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu said Sunday that if the
Colombian government were to request more assistance, Bush probably
would order American troops to take an active role.
   ``Is the president willing to risk American servicemen in this
war on drugs?'' he was asked.
   ``Well, if that request ever came in, I'm sure the president
would recognize that the American public thinks that the drug
problem is so tough and so important that there is a great feeling
amongst American citizens that we probably should take even that
risk,'' replied Sununu.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week
With David Brinkley,'' also said American personnel in Colombia
would be at some risk and would be prepared to defend themselves.
   ``I can't guarantee that it's absolutely risk-free,'' said
Cheney. ``The possibility exists that they would become targets for
the cartel. There is some risk involved. They (U.S. personnel) will
be able to defend themselves.''
   In the last two decades, millions people have been arrested on
drug charges, billions of dollars worth of illegal drugs have been
seized, rock 'n' roll stars and famous athletes have died of
overdoses, and some inner cities have added deadly drug-related
gunfights to existing problems of poverty, unemployment,
discrimination and alcohol and heroin abuse.
   Billions of dollars have been spent on law enforcement, less for
treatment and prevention.
   From fiscal 1981 through 1989, the federal government spent $16.5
billion for law enforcement, $2.4 billion for drug abuse prevention
and $2.4 billion for treatment for a total expenditure of $21.3
billion, according to the General Accounting Office, an arm of
Congress.
   Most of that _ $13.6 billion _ was spent in the last three years:
$10.4 billion for law enforcement, $1.7 billion for prevention and
$1.5 billion for treatment.
   Meanwhile, cocaine is pouring over the nation's borders, domestic
growers produce 25 percent of the nation's marijuana supply, and the
heroin problem is growing. The price of the three drugs is going
down and the purity is going up.
   The arrest and incarceration of Carlos Lehder _ a leader of the
Medellin drug cartel who was extradited by Colombia to the United
States two years ago _ did not make a dent in the operation of that
cartel, reputed to be the world's largest cocaine organization, nor
in the availability of cocaine.
   William J. Bennett, director of national drug control policy and
the person who developed the basis for Bush's strategy by order of
Congress, acknowledged over the weekend that ``you can cut off the
head and the body will still move and other heads will come in to
replace it.''
   However, he said in the interview on CNN, ``We think that when
you disrupt a major criminal organization like this, you are
disrupting the doing of their business, and that's a good thing.''
   The strategy will hit hard on so-called casual users, with calls
for more arrests, more seizures of personal property and more
widespread drug-testing, Bennett said.
   The idea, he said, is to increase ``the sanction for drug use at
every link in the chain.''
   Bennett believes a turning point may already have been reached in
the casual use of illegal drugs, pointing to the 1988 National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse.
   The survey found a 37 percent decrease from a 1985 survey in the
number of people who said they had used marijuana, cocaine or other
illicit drugs in the previous month. In addition, the survey
indicated that the number of people who said they had used an
illegal drug in the previous year fell by 25 percent over the three
years.
   ``We are making some real progress in this war,'' Bennett said
when the survey was released in July. ``People who have been saying,
`All is lost, we can't win, let's legalize,' have never been more
wrong.''
   The survey found that the number of heavy cocaine users,
including those using the highly addictive form of the drug called
crack, rose sharply from 1985 to 1988 _ by 33 percent for those
using it once a week or more and by 19 percent for daily and
almost-daily users.
   On the other hand, Bennett attributed a drop in casual use to ``a
triumph of changed attitudes.''
   The ``Just Say No'' campaign launched by former first lady Nancy
Reagan, a host of anti-drug advertisements on television and
incessant verbal attacks by Bennett and others on casual users
apparently have had some impact, at least on what people say they do.
   But it is unclear whether they're really doing what they say they
are.
   The National Institute of Justice's Drug Use Forecasting report
for the fourth quarter of 1988, based on confidential interviews and
drug tests of people arrested in various cities, found that many of
those people lied.
   Each person interviewed knew that a urinalysis would be done, yet
in most cities, two to four times more drug users were detected by
urinalysis than by self-reports, the NIJ found. For example, among
men arrested and interviewed in Phoenix, Ariz., 8 percent said they
had used cocaine. Urine tests found 34 percent had done so.

   A majority of Britons blame bad management, rather
than labor unions, for the nation's economic woes, a public opinion
survey reported.
   The Sunday Times, which commissioned the poll, said 60 percent of
respondents believe management is more to blame than unions.
   When asked if unions have too much power, 42 percent said no and
41 percent said yes _ the first time since 1975 that more
respondents took the unions' side on that question in the poll, the
report said.
   Britain had a Labor government in 1975. It was ousted in 1979
after a winter of strikes against a pay freeze. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives are still in power 10 years later
after restricting union power to call strikes and to support them
with sympathy actions.
   A majority said most unions are controlled by a few extremists
and militants, but 77 percent said unions are needed to protect
workers' interests.
   The polling company, Market and Opinion Research International,
said it questioned 1,946 adults, including 440 union members, across
the country. No margin of error was reported.
   Britain has low economic investment which results in steadily
falling manufacturing capacity, low economic growth, unemployment
ranging up to 25 percent in the older industrial areas, and a
declining share of world markets.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian forces fought with
artillery in Lebanon's central mountains on Sunday, shattering an
18-hour lull.
   Police said one person was killed and 11 were wounded in Sunday's
exchanges. The latest casualties raised the toll since the fighting
broke out March 8 to at least 826 killed and 2,449 wounded.
   Sunday's battle flared around the mountain town of Douar, one of
four routes into the besieged Christian heartland north of Beirut.
   The clashes, which ignited forest fires, occurred on the eastern
flank of the coastal enclave, ringed on its landward sides by the
Syrians and their Moslem allies.
   They have reportedly been massing their forces in recent days,
but they made no clear move to push into the Christian enclave
Sunday.
   Though Beirut has been battered nearly incessantly in the six
months of fighting, the capital was quiet during Sunday's clashes.
Christian and Moslem sectors of the city were hammered for 36 hours
between Thursday and Saturday, when at least 20 people were killed
and more than 100 wounded in one of the hardest-fought
Syrian-Christian duels.
   On Sunday, Syrian howitzers and mortars pounded Douar and the
resort towns of Kekfaya and Btighrin that are clustered around
twisting roads leading into Christian territory, where an estimated
1 million people are trapped.
   The Christian forces, led by Gen. Michel Aoun, retaliated by
hitting Syrian positions in the mountains with 155mm howitzer and
tank fire, police said.
   Pine woods burned out of control because firefighters could not
reach the battle zone northeast of Beirut, said a police spokesman
who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   The rival forces also skirmished with machine guns and
truck-mounted 106mm recoilless guns around the mountaintop Christian
stronghold of Souk el-Gharb southeast of Beirut, the spokesman said.
   Aoun began the current round of a 14-year-old civil war by
blockading ports controlled by Moslem militias. He then declared a
``war of liberation'' to drive Syrian forces from Lebanon.
   The 40,000 Syrian troops came to Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate. However, Aoun says they are backing the Moslem
side in the civil war.
   The fighting has forced all but an estimated 150,000 of Beirut's
1.5 million population to flee their devastated city.

   Half of Americans say workers are better off with
unions than without, but more people regard management favorably
than view unions favorably, a poll has found.
   Many respondents in the Media General-Associated Press poll saw
unions as weakening, and few objected to that trend. Still, by a 49
percent to 31 percent margin, they said workers are better off with
a union than without one.
   In what could be seen as a positive sign for the future of
unions, young respondents, ages 18 to 29, were the most likely to
favor unions. They scored higher than their elders on questions
about their opinion of workers and about whether they think
employees are better off under unions.
   Overall, however, non-unionized respondents were more unwilling
than willing to join a union _ 47-37 percent, with the rest unsure.
   Moreover, while 44 percent thought of unions favorably, 64
percent had a positive view of management. And seven in 10 favored
so-called right-to-work laws, which ban mandatory union membership.
   On other issues, the poll found most workers this Labor Day
satisfied with their salaries, working conditions and time off. But
41 percent rated their pensions fair or poor, and 37 percent rated
their pay as fair or poor.
   Nearly nine in 10 respondents backed raising the minimum wage,
which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981. Most supported the $4.55
minimum approved by Congress over the $4.25 urged by President Bush,
but most also liked Bush's plan allowing new workers to be kept at
$3.35 for their first six months.
   Bush vetoed legislation in June that would have phased in a $4.55
minimum wage by 1991 and did not include his ``training wage''
proposal. Congress is expected to take up the issue again this fall.
   The poll was conducted by telephone among a random sample of
1,163 adults from July 6-17. It had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 points for the entire group and 4 points for the 812 who
were employed.
   When rating their own circumstances at work, respondents gave the
highest grades to the safety of their workplace _ 87 percent said
``excellent'' or ``good'' _ and their overall working conditions,
with 81 percent favorable.
   Sixty-nine percent expressed satisfaction with their time off, 61
percent rated their health benefits favorably and 60 percent said
their salary was excellent or good as opposed to only fair or poor.
   The lowest ratings went to pension benefits: Of those with an
opinion, just 46 percent viewed their pension plans as excellent or
good, while 41 percent were dissatisfied. A quarter overall rated
their pension benefits as poor.
   Benefits were not the prime concern, however: Fifty-four percent
said they would prefer better wages to better benefits.
   Concern over wages lessened among white-collar, management
workers. Seventy-one percent of them rated their salaries favorably,
compared with 57 percent of blue-collar workers and of
non-management white-collar workers.
   Union members also were less likely to be concerned about their
wages. Seventy-one percent were satisfied, equal to the salary
satisfaction among management workers.
   Union and management split on another point: Union members said
by 83-10 percent that workers are better off with unions, while
management employees said by 46-37 percent that workers are better
off non-unionized.
   Southerners also were more dubious of unions _ they split about
evenly on the question _ while the youngest group (by 53-29 percent)
and the oldest group (those over 64, by 52-21) said workers are
better off with unions.
   Union membership, declining over the years, now accounts for just
under 17 percent of the nation's work force.
   In the poll, among those not in unions now, 38 percent in the
youngest group ruled out joining one. That rose to about 50 percent
of their elders.
   Similarly, 52 percent of the youngest had a favorable view of
unions and 29 percent viewed unions unfavorably, while older people
were split, about 40-40. The rest had no opinion.
   Forty-three percent overall said unions are getting weaker and
just 15 percent said they are getting stronger. Still, 33 percent
said unions in this country are too strong, while just 20 percent
said they are too weak.

   President Bush was called on to
deliver his own impromptu sermon at church Sunday and promptly went
out and caught a fish _ the first of his vacation.
   ``The jinx is broken!'' a jubilant president exclaimed as he came
ashore with a two-foot-long bluefish.
   He had started the day at St. Ann's Episcopal Church where the
Rev. Laman H. Bruner Jr., after his own sermon, turned the pulpit
over to the president, who told his fellow parishioners he was ready
for the end of summer.
   ``Tomorrow it starts all over again,'' said Bush. ``I don't know
what you guys have to do, but I know what I've got to do: head back
to work.''
   Like a student beginning the new school year after Labor Day,
Bush said he needed to ``start studying hard'' for the drug speech
he will deliver to the nation Tuesday night.
   ``It's the first speech I'll give from the Oval Office. I'm not
going to be scared,'' said Bush, who began the talk recalling how as
a young child he would shake when called upon to recite a verse
during the summer services at St. Ann's.
   Bush spoke of the signs of faith he has encountered in communist
lands, and said, ``We're living in a time of real hope.''
   He exhorted young people ``to involve yourselves in the lives of
others. ... Do what you can to strengthen community life.''
   ``Indeed, I'll be asking our country to do that'' as part of the
anti-drug strategy, Bush said.
   ``Remember, don't ever forget that we are one nation under God,''
said Bush, who was joined at the service by Barbara, his mother
Dorothy Walker Bush and other relatives.
   Then, after a fast change of clothes, it was out to sea in his
speedboat Fidelity with wife Barbara, son Marvin and national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``What a day,'' said Bush, who had vowed to end his dry fishing
spell before returning to the White House on Monday after 20 days
here at the family's oceanfront retreat. ``It was a long, dry
summer, but it all worked out.
   ``It's what we call `stick-to-it-ivness','' said the president,
holding the glistening fish aloft with one hand as he steered the
boat to the dock with the other. ``A tremendous fish. ... a very
strong fish.'' He estimated it weighed ``nine or 10 pounds.''
   He said they had been led to the magic spot by some birds
circling overhead.
   There was no weigh-in, for Bush personally cleaned and filleted
the fish immediately upon docking.
   ``We're just going to get the steak,'' he said, tossing fish
entrails into the cove waters. ``This is nature, return to nature,''
he said, ``because in about two hours you'll see the gulls in here
picking this guy clean.''
   Bush performed the operation on a plastic bag, saving the head
``for soup.''
   Bush got his bluefish after only a few minutes in the water at
the outset of a 2{-hour expedition. They caught nothing else.
   ``My boy Marvin was steering the boat at the time. He did a
heckuva job. And as for General Scowcroft and Bar, they were
along,'' he said.
   Bush, who prides himself on his fishing abilities, had become the
butt of jokes, including a Portland Press Herald ``No Fish''
insignia that became a best-selling T-shirt.
   Bush went golfing later Sunday, and planned one final fishing
outing Monday morning before flying back to Washington early in the
Labor Day holiday afternoon.

   President Bush said he wasn't out to
``look busy'' on his vacation. No, this was a real vacation, pure
and simple, he insisted.
   Just to make sure everyone got the point, Bush spent the last
three weeks showcasing his good time.
   Americans saw him boating, playing tennis, golfing, dining out,
jogging, playing ball and otherwise having daily doses of fun.
   His self-ascribed nickname, Mr. Smooth, became almost a household
word. His bad-luck fishing streak was the subject of media accounts
nationwide.
   And when the president on a dare stripped off his shirt and
leaped into the sea with his slacks on, the burst of goofiness was
carried on the nightly news.
   Bush spent more hours in the public eye during his vacation than
he normally does at the White House.
   Unlike many past presidents who used vacations to get out of the
limelight, Bush seemed to relish the chance to show off his
recreational penchants.
   Away from the suit-and-tie world of Washington, Bush was a study
in perpetual sports motion. His golf speed _ 18 holes in around two
hours _ was dubbed ``aerobic golf'' by presidential physician
Lawrence Mohr.
   A keen competitive streak, tempered by apparent good
sportsmanship, was evident in everything he did from fishing to
horseshoes.
   Some might even say the president showed himself to be something
of a ham.
   There was the Sunday when he could have sent the press corps home
for a few hours after taking them to two church services. Instead he
invited them to his Walker's Point compound to watch his tennis
match.
   Typically, the president's activities on Walker's Point are not
observed by the press corps. But on this day, he suggested maybe the
reporters would like to see ``Mr. Smooth'' in action on the courts.
   Mr. Smooth is the name Bush uses for himself in horseshoes and
golf _ as in, ``Here comes Mr. Smooth.''
   When the press corps began covering the president's Kennebunkport
golf outings some months back, reporters and photographers watched
him tee off, then picked him up again on the last hole.
   Now, the small press pool that accompanies him to the course
covers anywhere from four holes to all 18, with Bush's approval.
   He was even heard to mutter,``I do better when they're here''
when he made a good drive after the cameras showed up on the 17th
tee during an otherwise lackluster round.
   In fact, Bush seemed to enjoy the golf audience, clowning for the
cameras especially when he made a good shot.
   On the ocean, there was no solitude for Bush on his daily jaunts
in his speedboat Fidelity. In addition to a Coast Guard cutter and
Secret Service boats that escorted him, he was trailed by a
five-boat flotilla of media chase vessels.
   That didn't seem to bother Bush, except he contended at one point
they were scaring off the fish. That excuse was not heard after Bush
friends began catching fish off Fidelity even when the presidential
hook remained bare.
   The chase boats generally were beyond shouting distance, but Bush
sometimes allowed them in close for a photograph.
   Far from seeming to have had enough of the omnipresent media
coverage, Bush often invited it.
   One day he piloted Fidelity, filled with children and
grandchildren, close to shore where a handful of reporters were
engaged in other matters. He began a shouted chitchat with them
across the waters.
   He stayed until a camera crew was positioned on the shore, then
roared off into the sunshine, framing a picture perfect shot.
   Instead of holing up in privacy _ like Ronald Reagan at his Santa
Barbara ranch or Richard Nixon at his seaside San Clemente _ Bush
was out every day. He surprised tourists and local residents by
driving his boat up to dockside restaurants or gasoline wharfs.
   He and first lady Barbara Bush had small or large dinner parties
almost every night.
   On Sundays, there was church, with Bush shaking hands with the
congregation afterward. On the last Sunday of his vacation he made
some remarks from the pulpit and promptly went out and caught the
first fish of his summer break.
   He had a steady stream of overnight visitors to Walker's Point _
including the honeymooning Danish Prime Minister Poul Schlueter and
his bride, the family of Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and
evangelist Billy Graham.
   Reporters who showed up in running clothes to cover his morning
jogs were invited to join him.
   Bush took note of all the fun he was having in a speech _ the
only one of his trip _ to the local Chamber of Commerce.
   `` We are doing some work, but I have confessed at the very
outset that this is a pure, total vacation. And I'm not going to
look busy in order to convince people in America that it's something
other than a vacation,'' he said.

   West German officials and Red
Cross volunteers battled cold, rainy weather and growing public
resentment as they prepared Sunday for the arrival of thousands of
East German refugees.
   Groups of curious Bavarians lingered at the outskirts of an old
concrete factory in this Medieval town across the Donau River from
Austria, watching relief workers erect tents and feeding stations
for the first of as many as 20,000 East Germans who are expected to
begin arriving Monday.
   Five Red Cross encampments capable of taking in about 5,000
refugees were readied during the weekend in Vilshofen and in other
small border towns in this staunchly conservative farming region in
southeastern West Germany.
   Steady downpours and temperatures dropping to near freezing
overnight hampered the work by 300 Red Cross and Bavarian state
civil defense workers.
   Nevertheless, they met their Sunday night deadline for completing
basic facilities in Vilshofen, Tiefenbach and in the border towns of
Freilassing, Trostberg and Hengersberg.
   While West Germany's Constitution regards East Germans as
citizens and a generous social security system offers financial
support and help in resettling, some have expressed resentment about
the refugee tide.
   ``I wouldn't mind if it was just temporary, but I know it's
not,'' grumbled an elderly Vilshofen man in traditional Bavarian
dress of loden-green knickers, high-buttoned jacket and plumed cap.
   ``This is a small town and there's no industry here to take them
in,'' added his wife.
   The couple moved off when asked for their names.
   The reluctance of some West Germans to take in those fleeing
economic stagnation or repression in the East is a subject few will
discuss openly.
   But some resent the immediate benefits afforded the new arrivals,
who are entitled to the same unemployment or pension funds collected
by West Germans who contributed to the system for decades.
   ``If it were wartime, one could understand this, but not now,''
complained Anna Berger, a local farmer selling produce in the
Vilshofen public market on Saturday. ``How can all these people just
simply abandon their native land? They ought to stick it out over
there a little longer.''
   Bavarian state Interior Minister Gebhard Glueck, who visited the
tent cities in Vilshofen and Tiefenbach on Sunday, declared the
expected influx of East Germans ``the largest refugee movement in
Germany since the post-war expulsions.''
   Echoing a plea from federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl a day earlier,
Glueck called on West Germans to welcome those driven from their
homeland in the same spirit that allowed the assimilation of 12
million refugees in West Germany following the forced migrations
after World War II.
   ``We want, and we will, handle this situation as a community,''
Glueck stated in a speech in the town of Marktredwitz before
visiting the tent camps.
   Kohl on Saturday called on West Germans to show ``solidarity''
with the refugees, apparently attempting to ease public strains over
the short-term burdens imposed by the newcomers.
   West Germans owe the refugees support ``because we have had the
good fortune after the war to live in this part of Germany,'' Kohl
said.
   The East Germans are expected to strain the public coffers
initially.
   But federal labor officials have pointed out that the mostly
youthful and healthy refugees crowding the government reception
camps are relieving the national shortage of blue-collar workers and
will probably provide an economic boost after a few months.

<HEAD>Ousted Gay Congressman Urges Congress to go Slow on Judging Personal
Lives</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A gay former congressman, forced out of office
by a sex scandal nine years ago, came to the defense Sunday of
embattled Rep. Barney Frank, saying the Capitol Hill brouhaha sounds
all too familiar _ and could backfire.
   ``It has the strange familiarity of what Yogi Berra might have
called `deja vu all over again','' former Rep. Robert Bauman, a
Republican, wrote in a lengthy article in The Washington Post on the
current controversy involving Frank, a Democrat, and his
relationship with a male prostitute.
   Last month, Frank, who in 1987 acknowledged to being gay,
confirmed published reports that he had solicited and then
befriended a male prostitute, allowed him to use his Washington
apartment, and paid him $20,000 a year from private funds to do
various chores.
   The prostitute, Steven Gobie, claimed he operated a prostitution
service out of Frank's apartment and that the Massachusetts
congressman knew about it. Frank has denied any such knowledge and
despite the controversy recently received signs of continuing strong
support back in his home district.
   Bauman, a staunch conservative, had no such luck and was defeated
in his Maryland district in 1980, ending eight years in Congress
after it was revealed he was gay and had been arrested for
soliciting a male prostitute.
   Bauman wrote in the Sunday edition of the Post that he probably
would disagree with Frank, a liberal, on 95 percent of the issues
facing America and likely would not vote for him.
   ``But I surely would not vote against him for what happened with
the likes of Steve Gobie,'' Bauman wrote, chastising Gobie as a
``louse'' and a ``despicable character'' who thinks nothing of
turning on his ``former mentor'' for personal gain. Frank has said
he befriended Gobie because he wanted to help him recover from past
mistakes including a prison record.
   Referring to the possibility that Congress may move to censure or
reprimand Frank, Bauman, now a Washington lawyer, wrote:
   ``One thing I do know. The House of Representatives, both
collectively and individually, is not equipped to judge Barney Frank
in this matter. They may well decide to censure or reprimand him for
his private _ now very public _ past conduct, but they do so at
their own peril.
   ``This is not an easy case of Jim Wright venality. It is not a
case of a congressman taking advantage of a page boy or page girl.
It is a case involving consenting adults, one of whom happened to be
a congressman and the other a louse. And if such private acts become
the jurisdiction of Congress, the lines of the miscreants might as
well begin forming on the Right and the Left.''
   Bauman continued, ``While the media and the public might enjoy
the titillation of this incipient reign of terror, the end result
will be the decimation of government.''
   Bauman also urged against Frank resigning, saying the matter is
for the voters in his district to decide.

<HEAD>Thousands Rally on Baltic Shores to Protest Pollution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Baltic coast residents lined up
hand-in-hand on the seashore Sunday to protest pollution that they
say is killing the Baltic Sea, journalists and activists said.
   ``People want to bring attention to the fact that the sea is
dying,'' said Askolds Rodins, a translator at the Latvian People's
Front newspaper Atmoda. He was speaking in a telephone interview
from Riga, the Latvian republic's capital.
   Concern over pollution is widespread in Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania, which also are homes of popular movements for greater
autonomy.
   Sunday's seaside protest was organized by the region's fledgling
Greens environmental movement.
   Many Baltic residents believe Moscow authorities have recklessly
built factories and plants that pollute the environment. They have
pressed for local control over polluters and economic resources.
   New measures beginning Jan. 1 will give Estonia and Latvia more
control over local factories.
   This year's anti-pollution demonstration was overshadowed by
other Baltic political events, journalists and activists said. An
Estonian Radio editor said thousands took to the beaches Sunday, but
the turnout was smaller than expected.
   ``There were so many events already, people are tired,'' said the
editor, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a telephone interview
from Tallinn, the Estonian capital.
   On Aug. 23, more than 1 million Baltic residents linked hands in
a giant human chain stretching across the three republics. The chain
was formed to protest the Hitler-Stalin pact that led to the Soviet
annexation of the Baltic nations.

   Chopper, a small female Chesapeake
blue-claw crab, had to endure some rough pre-race handling but it
paid off as she scrambled to victory in the 42nd National Hard Crab
Derby.
   Jason Byrd, 14, owner of the winner, said throughbred crabs need
to be riled up to prepare for competition. His mother, Kathy Byrd,
said that was accomplished by taunting it with a stick for two hours
``to get it mangy.''
   Chopper survived a preliminary heat and beat 15 finalists
Saturday to top the field of 283.
   Jason said another key was that he caught his own entry instead
of using one furnished by race organizers.
   One race worker, however, said the real key is finding a lively,
small crab.
   ``A lot of people bring the big ones and think they are going to
win,'' said Glenn Stewart of Crisfield. ``But it's the little ones.''
   Participants, who paid $3, were assigned a crab or could enter
their own. Each crab had to finish in the top three of a preliminary
heat to qualify for the final.
   In the Governor's Cup, ``Yellowstone Crab,'' representing the
landlocked state of Wyoming, skittered over the end of a 16-foot
plywood ramp ahead of crabs representing 43 other states to win the
crustacean version of the run for the roses.

   The Calgary Flames will be going where no
NHL team has gone before when they leave Monday night for a
preseason tour that includes four games in the Soviet Union. But
they're not going overseas empty-handed.
   Packed among the 400 rolls of tape, 200 pucks and 57 pairs of
skates the defending Stanley Cup champions are lugging along will be
100 pounds of pasta and plenty of sauce to go with it.
   North American-style breakfast foods, granola bars and other
snacks also will be on the menu.
   ``A lot of people have been concerned about the food,'' said
assistant general manager Doug Risebrough. ``A lot of that stretches
from earlier visits to Russia. We're not going over there with a
self-containing idea. We're going to Russia and basically be
Russians for 11 days.''
   Except at mealtime.
   The pasta and sauce will be used for pregame meals and the Flames
are taking their own breakfast foods due to a concern about the lack
of cereals and eggs.
   ``We think if our players are given a similar breakfast to what
they are used to here, that will help the transition,'' Risebrough
said. ``As for the pregame meal, it's just because we're more
comfortable with what we know.''
   The Flames and Washington Capitals are the first two NHL teams
ever to travel to the Soviet Union. Both will play four games
against Soviet teams before returning home to complete their
exhibition schedule.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a text of the statement issued Sunday in
Paris by three Roman Catholic cardinals who negotiated a 1987
agreement to move a convent away from the Auschwitz death camp. It
was translated from French by The Associated Press.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   If the Jewish delegation at the Geneva meetings, led by Mr. Theo
Klein, then president of the European Jewish Congress, is ``not
competent,'' who would be?
   And if four cardinals, including the archbishop of Krakow, are
not qualified to represent the Catholic side, who might be?
   The Auschwitz camp is in the Krakow diocese. According to church
law, its archbishop has full authority there. The cardinals who
accompanied him belong to nations who, in the West, were among the
chief victims of the Hitler barbarism.
   These accords were patiently and loyally negotiated over two
years. The Catholic signatories promised that the financing would
not fall on the Krakow diocese and still less on Poland.
   Cardinal Glemp could only have been speaking for himself in
talking of a renegotiation of the Geneva accords. Particularly since
until now he has always let it be known that Cardinal Macharski was
solely responsible and that the Polish Conference of Bishops, on
March 9, 1989, had committed itself in turn by giving its support to
the realization of this accord.
   The signed engagements must be carried out: they recognize the
legitimacy of the Auschwitz Carmel at Oswiecim, outside the
perimeter of the concentration camp which UNESCO, in consideration
of its ``exceptional universal value,'' has placed on the list of
``world cultural heritage'' in October 1979 at the request of the
Polish government then in place.
   Signed:
   Cardinal Albert Decourtray, chairman of the Catholic delegation
   Cardinal Godfried Danneels, archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels
   Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, archbishop of Paris

<HEAD>Chic Shops, Valet Parking, Concierges: Upscale Spenders Can Have

<DATELINE>NEWTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen Karp's tony new shopping center is
more Maserati than Cadillac. The $50 million Atrium is opulent and
flashy, but in a way tailored to attract sophisticated, upscale
spenders.
   ``It's not for the K mart shopper,'' the mall magnate says. This
is an all-frills enterprise, adds Karp, designed to provide his
clients with the services he says they want most.
   The Atrium features doormen, valet parking, a concierge, a coat
check, tailors and even a personal shopper for those who don't have
the time to browse.
   Inside the 3-acre, nine-story granite complex off busy Route 9
are such stores as Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, The Limited,
Williams-Sonoma, Victoria's Secret and Godiva Chocolatier.
   As close as across the street are malls featuring many of the
same stores as well as such modish retailers as Bloomingdale's,
Brooks Brothers, Tiffany's, Laura Ashley, Ralph Lauren and Neiman
Marcus.
   But Atrium officials claim there's nothing else like it anywhere
in the nation. New York's flashy Trump Tower may have the same pink
marble and brass, but try finding all the personal services, they
say.
   ``The personalization makes the customers feel important,'' said
General Manager Judith Tripaldi. ``And if you raise a person's level
of self-esteem they feel good and come back.''
   The Atrium team has made a science of climbing into the psyches
of prospective clients, mainly affluent residents of this Boston
suburb.
   Karp and his partners at New England Development Co., which owns
14 regional malls, came to this latest venture armed with years of
experience and reams of market research.
   ``The demographics here are among the top in the United States,''
Karp said. ``Price is only the third or fourth most important
priority to these customers. Service is the thing.''
   And not just any service. Karp says his clients want efficiency
and sunny salespeople, but they also want something more, a certain
je ne sais quoi.
   ``This market has an international flavor,'' he said. ``They have
a lot of identification with European labels and ... with New York.''
   Janice Colley identifies with New York. The Westchester County
resident was in the Boston area staying with friends and decided to
stop by for the Atrium's grand opening.
   She loved the azaleas and Greek revival columns, but wondered
about the dollars and sense of it all. She'd just seen a globe her
family would love, but the $4,500 pricetag was out of this world.
   ``I'd rather go where you can get the best value for your
money,'' she said. ``I look at all this marble and think to myself
it's going to cost a lot to keep it clean.''
   Jody Martin, a managing partner at Stillerman Jones &amp; Co., an
Indianapolis market research firm, said K marts and other discount
outlets are phenomenally successful because their prices are low and
everyone knows it.
   ``In mainstream America valet parking is not proven to be very
critical to choosing a (shopping) center,'' Martin said in a
telephone interview. ``They want parking, restrooms, stores open
late, a post office, bank machine ... Day-to-day kinds of
necessities rather than luxuries.''
   K mart spokeswoman Leslie Kota said research indicated 50 percent
of all American shoppers, including those from upper income groups,
frequent the discount chain's 2,100 stores, which had an income last
year of $27.3 billion.
   Esther Felix and Sophie Richmond, who describe themselves as
``serious'' shoppers, were aglow last week with the Atrium's
architecture, pleasant security guards and glorious bathrooms.
   ``It's in exquisite taste and I love the luxury.'' Richmond said.
``They're making all the right moves and I can hardly wait until
Henri Bendel's arrives.''
   Bendel's, the New York department store, is one of several still
setting up. All the Atrium's retailers were scheduled to open by
February and Karp said he expected to begin turning a profit shortly
thereafter.
   ``Developers from all over the world are coming to look at what
we're doing here,'' he said. ``We've got a five-star hotel
mentality.''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms Darken Midwest And Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms and showers were scattered across the Midwest and
the Southeast on Sunday, but most of the rest of the nation enjoyed
a sunny Labor Day weekend.
   The rain spread across western and central Minnesota, Iowa,
southeast Nebraska, northeast Kansas and extreme northwestern
Missouri.
   Thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front crossing the
Dakotas produced golf ball-size hail north of Bowlus, Minn., and
1-inch hail hail at Battle Lake, Minn.
   A second system of showers and thunderstorms moved into the
Southeast over southern and central Georgia, coastal South Carolina
and Florida.
   Showers and thunderstorms also developed over parts of Arizona,
soaking the Phoenix area with more than an inch of rain overnight. A
few showers dampened southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Arkansas.
   Fair to partly sunny skies prevailed across the rest of the
nation.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 2 p.m.
EDT included 1.13 inches at Albany, Ga., 1.1 inches at Fargo, N.D.,
and .97 inches at Lincoln, Neb.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Lewistown, Mont., and Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 105
degrees at Blythe, Calif.
   The low for the nation Sunday morning was 28 degrees at Truckee,
Calif.
   Record high temperatures for the day included 96 degrees in Port
Arthur, Texas, breaking the record of 95 set in 1980. The
thermometer reached 98 in Brownsville, tying a 69-year-old record.
   The forecast for Labor Day called for showers and thunderstorms
from the upper and middle Mississippi Valley across eastern portions
of the central Plains into Oklahoma, and from the southern Atlantic
Coast states and Florida to the eastern half of the Gulf Coast
region. Skies were expected to be partly cloudy over Washington
state, with sunny skies forecast for most of the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were expected in the 60s in much of New
England; the 90s from the Florida Panhandle across the lower
Mississippi Valley, the southern Plains and the southern half of New
Mexico; and near 100 degrees from central Texas to the Rio Grande
valley, with highs from 100 to 110 degrees in the desert Southwest
and interior valleys of California. Highs were expected in the 70s
and 80s over the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Saving Lives Is Getting To Be a Habit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A utility company employee says saving lives
seems to be a fringe benefit of his job.
   In the past three years, Stan Dexter has helped rescued a family
from a burning home, revived a girl suffering from a seizure and
resuscitated a man who got a 12,000-volt shock.
   ``It just seems natural,'' Dexter said. ``You know what has to be
done, and you go in and do it.''
   Dexter, a troubleshooter for the Kansas Gas and Electric Co., was
called to investigate a power failure in July in an electrical
substation in Wichita. He arrived 12 minutes later to find a man who
seemed to be dead.
   Mark Albright had gotten past a barbed-wire fence and warning
signs into the substation, where he was badly burned by a
12,000-volt transformer. He was hospitalized for some time, but is
now out and attending physical therapy.
   ``He was pretty much lifeless,'' Dexter said. ``He wasn't
breathing, and if he had a pulse, I sure couldn't find it.''
   Dexter administered cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, called rescue
workers and helped them make their way around dangerous electrical
equipment before fixing the power outage.
   ``I'm proud, and I'm glad I was the one who responded to the
call,'' said Dexter, who teaches life-saving techniques at the
American Red Cross.
   Three years ago, Dexter and two co-workers received citations
from KG&amp;E for their rescue of a Valley Center family. The American
Red Cross gave Dexter its highest award for resuscitating 2-year-old
Regina Charles after she underwent a seizure.
   Dexter said he loves his job because it allows him to work
outdoors and meet people. Saving the occasional life, he said, is
just a fringe benefit.

   In other cities, hate crimes typically
decrease markedly after a racially motivated killing, authorities
say. But reported hate crimes are booming in this nearly all-white
city since ``skinheads'' beat an Ethiopian immigrant to death in
November.
   Police report heightened activity by skinheads _ young, white
racists who affect shaved heads and military garb _ since the
killing of Mulugeta Seraw. Police also blame increased violence on
recruitment by racist groups targeting the Northwest, with its small
minority populations, for an Aryan homeland.
   ``In their minds, it's easier to get rid of blacks and Chinese
and whatnot in Oregon than in New Jersey,'' said Loren Christensen
of the Portland Police Bureau.
   From May 1988 until Seraw's death Nov. 12, nine racially
motivated crimes were reported in Multnomah County, which
encompasses Portland and suburbs _ but 77 were reported after the
killing through May 10 this year, the Metropolitan Human Relations
Commission said.
   Georgia Owens, who compiled those figures, said it was possible
publicity about Seraw's death may have prompted more victims to
report such crimes.
   Christensen, who tracks skinheads for the police, said he began
getting calls after the killing from teachers reporting some
students had shaved their heads.
   ``A lot of people got caught up in the glamour of that
homicide,'' Christensen said, ``street-type people looking for a
cause, something to identify with.''
   He also cited recruiting efforts by Tom Metzger, a southern
California television repairman who heads the White Aryan
Resistance, and Metzger's son, John, president of the Aryan Youth
Movement.
   Christensen said organized groups like WAR aren't as active in
Portland as ``freelance'' skinheads, who travel in groups of three
to 20.
   Two skinheads have pleaded guilty in Seraw's killing and a third
is awaiting trial. Authorities say the skinheads attacked Seraw and
two companions outside Seraw's home in southeast Portland, clubbing
him to death with a baseball bat.
   Skinheads were responsible for at least 46 of the 86 hate crimes
reported in the Portland area during the year ended May 10, Owens
said. Of those incidents, 26 involved violence; most of the rest
were harassment, intimidation and vandalism.
   ``A lot of the victimless crimes, leafleting and vandalism, those
were not counted in the skinhead category. If we couldn't say a
skinhead group had done it, we didn't include it,'' said Owens.
   Whatever the reason for the increase in reported hate crimes,
Marvin Stern of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in
Seattle said it defies the trend in other cities.
   ``In every other city in the country where skinheads are active,
once an act has been committed and responded to by law enforcement,
we've seen a great decline in activity or almost disappearance,''
Stern said.
   Stern also said racist groups ``believe primarily that the states
of Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Wyoming, because they have
relatively few minorities, are the last great region of the country
that that they can take over for themselves _ and basically have
declared this to be a colony for the white Aryan people.''
   According to 1985 U.S. census statistics, whites make up more
than 92 percent of Portland's population. More than 560,000 people
live in Multnomah County.
   ``We have an essentially Caucasian society here,'' said Kathy
Dimond, spokeswoman for Mayor Bud Clark. ``That might possibly make
someone who is interested in maintaining a white society more
comfortable.''
   Residents incensed by racism are coming to community meetings to
learn how to spot warning signs in children who are drawn to
skinhead groups.
   Residents are shocked ``that these people exist and live among
them in their own community,'' said Peg Caliendo of Southeast
Uplift, a city-supported group that helps neighborhoods with crime
prevention. ``We tend to think of crime as existing outside of our
particular areas.''
   She helped organize a rally attended by 75 people Saturday at
Brentwood Park, where a Hispanic girl and two other teen-agers were
attacked earlier last week. Six people have been arrested in that
attack: three men described as skinheads, and three teen-agers.
   The rally provided a way for residents to ``reclaim'' the park by
cleaning up graffiti, meeting their neighbors and expressing their
unity, Caliendo said.
   ``We want the community to feel safe by banding together,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Six Teens Die When Car Plunges Into Ravine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A car full of teen-agers who may have been
fleeing a party raided by police missed a stone bridge and plunged
into a shallow creek, killing six students from a rural high school,
authorities said Sunday.
   The five boys and one girl, all believed to be between 15 and 17,
may have been dead for up to 20 hours before the car was found,
police said. The car went off a gravel road, missed the bridge and
went down a ravine, landing in the creek partially submerged on its
side.
   The accident was discovered by a boy walking along the road about
6 p.m. Saturday, but authorities said they were checking reports of
a loud crash as early as 10 p.m. Friday.
   ``There's a chance they were there for some time,'' Brown County
Sheriff's Capt. William Craig said. ``Where they ended up, the car
wasn't visible from the road.'' The victims' identities were being
withheld Sunday.
   School Superintendent Larry Lark confirmed all they were all
students at Wrightstown High School. Holland is an incorporated town
within Wrightstown, a rural community of 1,020 residents about 15
miles south of Green Bay.
   Principal Jack Lewis called the victims ``typical teen-age kids
for this area'' and said he did not know where the victims had been
or were going before the accident.
   But a group of teen-agers gathered outside St. Paul Roman
Catholic Church in Wrightstown on Sunday morning said they had known
the victims from school and heard they had left a party that police
raided.
   ``They all took off before it got raided,'' said Melanie
Buechler, 14.
   Deputy Sheriff Mike Schroll confirmed on Sunday that police had
broken up a party five or six miles from the crash site, but he did
not know if the victims had been at the party.
   To help grieving classmates, school officials alerted a team of
counselors assembled 11 months ago when five elementary-school girls
died in a car-pedestrian accident in nearby Pulaski.

   A pickup truck collided head on with an
ambulance carrying a dialysis patient and burst into flames, killing
four people and critically injuring one, police said Sunday.
   Among those killed in the crash late Saturday was Everett Smith,
70, who was being taken back to the Liberty Hall Convalescent
Hospital in Colchester, where he lives, from a hospital where he
undergoes kidney dialysis treatment three times a week.
   Also killed were the ambulance driver, William R. Lawton, 18, of
Killingworth and Carol G. Gillooly, 30, of Middlefield, who was an
attendant in the ambulance, said Sgt. Scott O'Mara, a state police
spokesman.
   The driver of the pickup truck, Jonathan Collard, 23, was also
killed, O'Mara said. His address was not known.
   A second ambulance attendant, Jose R. Aguilar Jr., 20, of Haddam,
was listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit of Saint
Francis Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   O'Mara said a preliminary investigation suggested that Collard's
pickup truck crossed the center line of Route 16 and collided
head-on with the ambulance, owned by Hunter's Ambulance of
Middletown.
   The medical examiner's office said tests were being done to
determine if there were any drugs or alcohol in Collard's system at
the time of the crash.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Appoints Musavi As Adviser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani
appointed former Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, a longtime rival, as
one of his advisers Sunday, Iran's official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   Musavi, 48, served as prime minister from 1981 until last month,
when the post was abolished in constitutional reforms approved by
national referendum held alongside the presidential election July 28.
   Musavi was the second key radical leader who has been absorbed by
Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, into his
administration in recent weeks.
   Former Intelligence Minister Mohammad Reyshahri was appointed
prosecutor-general last month.
   Former Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, dumped by
Rafsanjani, is the only major radical figure who has not been given
a position in Rafsanjani's government.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, reported Rafsanjani told Musavi in a
letter that the former premier's experience in government should not
be wasted.
   Musavi has frequently clashed with Rafsanjani over foreign and
economic policy. He favors tight state control of the economy and
opposes unrestrained links with the West.
   Rafsanjani favors a more open economy with greater private sector
participation and has sought to rebuild bridges with the West to end
Iran's isolation and help rebuild the economy following last year's
cease-fire in its 8-year-old war with Iraq.
   Musavi's appointment gives the radicals a voice in Rafsanjani's
administration, but the former premier was not expected to wield
substantial power.
   Rafsanjani, 55, has inherited a presidency with wider executive
powers than his precedessors under the constitutional reforms.
   These were aimed at eliminating competing power centers in Tehran
that had virtually paralyzed the decision making process and holding
up badly needed economic changes.
   But analysts believe he still faces problems if he tries to move
too fast on economic and foreign policy. Those moves could leave him
open to charges of deviating from the political legacy of Iran's
revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died June 3.

   More workers are killed on the job in the United

to a report that says the deaths cost the nation's economy at least
$15 billion each year.
   Workers in this country are 36 times more likely to be killed
than a Swede, and nine times more likely to be killed than a Briton,
the National Safe Workplace Institute found in its annual Labor Day
report.
   In addition, a U.S. worker is more likely to be seriously injured
on the job than a two-pack-a-day cigarette smoker is to contract
cancer, according to the report.
   ``The evidence indicates that the United States is slipping in
its efforts to reduce job injuries,'' Joseph A. Kinney, the group's
executive director, said in the report issued Saturday.
   The Chicago-based institute is a independent, non-profit
government watchdog group devoted to job safety issues.
   More muscle and money are needed from the government and the
private sector ``before it can be concluded that Americans are on
the road to safer work,'' according to the report.
   But it noted that some encouraging signs from the Department of
Labor and Occupational Safety and Health Administration indicate
policy may be shifting in the worker's favor.
   According to the group's report:
   _More than 10,000 men and women die each year from on-the-job
injuries.
   _Another 70,000 workers become permanently disabled each year as
a result of job-related conditions.
   _One out of 11 workers will be killed or seriously injured at
work.
   The problem is increasing, despite factors such as an aging _ and
theoretically more experienced _ workforce and new technology that
should reduce or eliminate risk of injury, the institute said.
   Bureau of Labor statistics show that in 1987, 8.3 U.S. workers
per 100 fulltime employees were injured on the job, up from 7.6 in
1983.
   In 1986, the nation had 10,700 occupational fatalities. The
figure would have been just 300 if the United State's fatality rate
were equal to Sweden's, and 6,838 if it were equal to Japan's, the
report said.
   But it said, there are ``signs of promise.''
   They include Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole's pledge to make
occupational safety and health a high priority, and recent action by
OSHA, the report said.
   For example, the group noted that on July 27, OSHA imposed a
$2.72 million fine and sought a court injunction against Friction
Division Products, Inc. of Trenton, N.J., for alleged failure to
protect workers from asbestos exposure.
   The company was accused of violating ``almost every provision of
OSHA's asbestos standard in the process of threatening the health
and even the lives of many of its workers,'' the report said.
   The report also cited a $2 million proposed penalty Mrs. Dole
issued July 7 against Ford Motor Co. ``for failing to live up to its
November 1987 agreement with the Department of Labor to accurately
record injuries and illnesses.''
   `While the final chapter of Dole's leadership is far from
written, the opening pages provide America's workers with the most
encouraging signs of safe work that they have had in several
years,'' the report concludes.

<HEAD>Israel Broadens Orders on Shooting Masked Palestinians</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with death of second Israeli soldier,
Amman denying Arab crossed from Jordan; No pickup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Israeli troops will be able to use live
ammunition ``day or night'' to stop masked Palestinian suspects
resisting arrest in the occupied territories, Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin said Sunday.
   Late Sunday, a second Israeli soldier died of wounds received in
a gun battle with an alleged infiltrator from Jordan Saturday, an
army spokesman said.
   The army said the 27-year-old soldier died from a bullet wound in
the head. His death came hours after the burial of a 25-year-old
soldier who was also killed in the clash. The Palestinian, who was
not identified, was slain by Israeli forces.
   In Amman, a senior official said Sunday that Jordan has found no
evidence the guerrilla had crossed from Jordanian territory.
   The strengthened security measure is directed at Arab youth who
enforce orders from the underground leaders of the 20-month-old
Palestinian uprising. Usually wearing masks and operating at night,
they sometimes attack and kill other Arabs suspected of
collaborating with the Israeli occupation.
   A Palestinian activist said the order will lead to more
Palestinian being shot.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Eitan Haber said that in the past,
soldiers were restricted to using plastic bullets against the
suspects after they refused to stop on order and after a warning
shot was fired. But other sources said on condition of anonymity
that firing live ammunition at masked suspects had been allowed at
night.
   In his announcement on Israel radio, Rabin said the new measure
was needed to crack down on Palestinian militants who are
terrorizing the population.
   He spoke after Palestinian enforcers killed one suspected
collaborator and wounded another in an attack with knives and
hatchets.
   An Arab journalist reported seeing the mutilated body of
25-year-old Riyad Abbas Salem Nasrallah on a Gaza City street
Sunday. Awaiting medical treatment next to the body was 18-year-old
Raed Majed Husseini. He had been beaten and stabbed.
   A crowd gathered as the body was put into an ambulance and
shouted ``death to collaborators!'' Other witnesses said some
passers-by spit and threw tomatoes.
   Masked Palestinians are blamed for most of the 105 Arabs killed
by other Arabs during the uprising. At least 557 Palestinians have
been killed by Israelis.
   ``Israeli Defense Forces will receive in the next few days
permission to use live fire to stop suspects who are wearing
masks,'' Rabin said. He said they would be allowed to do so ``day or
night.''
   Assad Saftawi, an elementary school principal in the Gaza Strip
and a prominent activist, predicted the new orders would lead to
more Palestinians being shot by soldiers and ``more enmity.''
   ``This is a serious crackdown on the intefadeh,'' he said, using
the Arab word for ``uprising.'' ``Political and military leaders in
Israel talk about a political solution for the intefadeh, but in
practice what they do contradicts what they say.''
   In other comments on Israel radio, Rabin also warned Jordan that
Israel would not tolerate attacks on its territory from Jordan.
   He spoke after the clash between Israeli soldiers and a
Palestinian guerrilla near the Jordan River. On March 17, an Israeli
soldier was also killed, and the two attackers fled back into Jordan.
   ``Jordan must find a way to prevent fire or infiltration from its
border if it wants ... to have neighborly relations with us,'' he
said.
   In Amman, a high government official denied the Palestinian
entered Israel from Jordan.
   ``We have no proof that a civilian crossed the cease-fire line,''
the official said on condition of anonymity. ``Usually when someone
crosses, we could figure it out. Either he crosses a certain fence
or sometimes (leaves) a footprint ... There's nothing.''
   In another development, Palestinian sources estimated 20,000
Palestinians crossed into Israel to work Sunday using new
Israeli-issued identity cards. Normally, nearly 50,000 go to work in
Israel.
   Leaders of the Palestinian uprising have tried to keep residents
from using the cards.

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiku Kaifu
stepped out of high-tech Boston and back in time Sunday, touring the
thatched huts of Plimoth Plantation and a replica of the Mayflower.
   The Prime Minister and his wife, Sachiyo, joined a group of
singers dressed as Pilgrims in a verse of the 100th Psalm, rode an
ox cart and sampled an old-fashioned spice loaf during a visit to a
reproduction of a 17th century New England colony in this coastal
community.
   In a brief news conference, Kaifu, 58, harked back to his first
visit to the United States 27 years ago, when he was first elected
to the Japanese Parliament.
   ``Simply, my impression was that this is a huge, vast country,''
he said through a translator.
   Other visitors to Plimoth Plantation snapped photos and waved as
the Prime Minister wound through the dirt streets of the early
colonial town.
   Earlier in the day, the prime minister visited Boston's Museum of
Fine Arts where he toured the Asiatic, Impressionist and Copley
galleries.
   At one point on the tour a member of his entourage gave Kaifu a
$1 bill, which the prime minister held up to compare to a portrait
of George Washington.
   At Fenway Park, Kaifu and his entourage were greated at a side
gate by Boston Red Sox general manager Lou Gorman and dined with the
club's owner, Jean Yawkey, in Fenway's 600 club.
   Kaifu and his wife received a warm welcome from the Boston fans
as he took off his suit coat and donned a Red Sox cap to throw up
the ceremonial first pitch to Boston catcher Rich Gedman.
   Later, Kaifu returned upstairs to the club's private box to watch
the game with Gorman.
   The prime minister's trip comes soon after his ascension to
Japan's top political post and is designed, in part, to lend
legitimacy to his new administration.
   Kaifu was named prime minister last month after his predecessors
in the ruling party suffered a series of political and sex scandals.
   Kaifu, who served twice as Japan's educational minister, also
visited Harvard University and received a souvenir T-shirt at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The prime minister wanted to emphasize the top priority he gives
to the relationship between the United States and Japan in the
educational sphere, said Richard Winslow, an adviser at the Japanese
Consulate.
   Kaifu arrived in Boston on Saturday and discussed trade issues
and education with Gov. Michael S. Dukakis and leaders of local
universities.
   Kaifu came straight from Washington, where he met Friday with
President Bush on the second leg of his 5-day tour of the United
States.
   After the meeting with Dukakis, the Prime Minister held a dinner
for the area's leading academicians. The presidents of Harvard
University, Boston University, The University of Massachusetts and
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were invited, as well as
several East Asia scholars.
   The prime minister is scheduled to fly to Mexico on Monday.

<TEXT>
   About 100 people shouting ``Down with
Noriega!'' gathered outside a church Sunday, and opposition leader
Guillermo Endara urged them to peacefully resist the new civilian
government installed by the general.
   ``We are going to dedicate ourselves to resisting this military
dictatorship of Manuel Antonio Noriega to the end,'' said Endara,
who international observers said won the May 7 elections in a
landslide.
   The government annulled that election.
   On Thursday, the Council of State, considered to be controlled by
Noriega, named Panama's comptroller, Francisco Rodriguez Poveda, as
president.
   Endara faced supporters outside the Christ the King Roman
Catholic Church after attending Mass with his running mates in the
election, Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford.
   Endara said the opposition to the government would continue, but
``this resistance is going to be peaceful,'' he said. ``With prayer,
God is not ever going to abandon the Panamanian people and soon,
very soon, he will give us justice and freedom,''
   Supporters chanted ``Down with Noriega!'' and ``You feel it, you
feel it, Endara is the president!''
   The meeting was the first public gathering by the opposition
since Rodriguez, 50, a high school friend of Noriega, was sworn as
provisional president on Friday.
   The opposition refused to form a junta with the civilian
government and the military. A day before the term of acting
president Manuel Solis Palma expired, Rodriguez was picked to be
president.
   The provisional government is to appoint a 41-member legislative
commission to replace the assembly, whose term also expired Friday.
   Rodriguez and the Council of State have said the holding of new
elections will depend on whether the United States lifts economic
sanctions imposed to pressure Noriega to step down as chief of the
Defense Forces.
   The United States has frozen about $300 million in Panamanian
assets and ha imposed trade sanctions that include a ban on any
payments to the Panamanian government.
   U.S. Embassy said Friday the American government is compiling a
list of companies and individuals associated with Noriega and may
block them from doing business with Americans.
   The United States began urging Noriega to step down after he was
indicted by two Florida grand juries in February 1988 on charges of
drug trafficking. Noriega denies the charges.

   Vietnam has established an import-export
bank financed by shareholders, a report seen Sunday said.
   The initial capital of the Vietnam Export-Import Bank is $28
million, divided into 250,000 shares.
   The bank was described in a Radio Hanoi broadcast as ``a
partnership corporation doing business in money and credit, and
providing banking services to serve production, processing of export
goods and export-import activities.''
   The radio said that as of late August, 130 units and 2,300
individuals had registered to buy 32,000 shares. Shareholders can
pay in Vietnamese or foreign currencies, precious metals or stones
or merchandise qualified for export.
   ``With a view to mobilizing more capital, the Vietnam
Export-Import Bankhas extended the period for buying shares to
mid-September,'' said the Radio Hanoi report, which was broadcast
Thursday and monitored and made available by a Western embassy.
   Vietnam is expanding its economic ties with Western and
non-communist Asian nations and is trying to attract foreign
investors to stimulate its poor economic performance in recent years.

   Defrocked PTL leader Jim Bakker is
undergoing a battery of tests to determine whether he can stand
trial, and will be examined by the same psychiatrist who evaluated
John Hinckley Jr., an official said.
   Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trial in U.S. District Court in
Charlotte was halted Thursday when Judge Robert Potter ordered him
sent to the Federal Correctional Institute in Butner, about 30 miles
northwest of here, to determine whether he is competent to stand
trial.
   Psychiatrists are giving Bakker examinations such as ink-blot and
personality tests, said Bryan Bledsoe, executive assistant to the
warden. ``There's a standard battery of tests done in all these
competency referrals,'' he said Saturday.
   Dr. Sally Johnson, Butner's chief of psychiatric services, who
also evaluated presidential assailant John Hinckley Jr., will lead
the team making the evaluation, Bledsoe said.
   Hinckley, who attempted to assassinate President Reagan in 1981
and severely wounded his press secretary, Jim Brady, was found
innocent by reason of insanity.
   A University of Virginia professor who has studied televangelism
and Bakker and his wife, Tammy, over the past decade said Sunday
that no matter what the psychiatrists find, Bakker has been living
in his own world.
   ``Here's a man who most of the time lives in a fantasy world that
he and his wife and his close associates have created,'' said
Jeffrey Hadden, author of ``Prime Time Preachers'' and
``Televangelism, Power and Politics.''
   He said they were pushed into the limelight through a combination
of hard work and luck, ``and then capitalized, exploited and took
advantage of it, and the dream got bigger and bigger and bigger.''
   ``I think that he just reached the breaking point,'' Hadden said
in a telephone interview from his home in Charlottesville, Va. ``But
I don't see it as catastrophic, and I don't see it as spelling
mental illness.''
   He cited the pressures of the conviction in July of former aides
and brothers David and James Taggart, the sentencing last month of
his former top deputy Richard Dortch, and the collapse Wednesday of
prosecution witness Steve Nelson from dehydration caused by the flu.
   Bakker, 49, is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy and
faces 120 years in prison and more than $5 million in fines.
Prosecutors say Bakker used nearly $4 million in ministry funds to
finance a lavish lifestyle.
   He was committed to Butner after psychiatrist Dr. Basil Jackson
testified Bakker was hallucinating and hiding his head under a couch
in his attorney's office.
   Potter suspended the trial at least until Wednesday, telling the
jury nothing about Bakker's condition.

   Stan and Caren Sutton were a romantic young
couple when they sank their life savings into a homemade fiberglass
sailboat for a voyage around the world.
   More than eight years later _ or 55 countries, 58,000 miles, and
two children later _ the Suttons sailed under the Golden Gate to
return home on Saturday.
   ``To be honest, it's a lot of work _ and a lot of fun,'' Stan
Sutton said. ``Anybody can do it. Just go for it.''
   The couple and their two daughters born during the family's
odyssey were welcomed at the St. Francis Yacht Club by dozens of
family and friends and a proclamation of welcome from the city.
   The Suttons, sailing novices who first shared the dream of
traveling around the world while high school sweethearts, started
building their 43-foot sailing yawl, the Marinka, 14 years ago. The
couple sold their possessions and sailed out beyond the Golden Gate
in March 1981.
   Three days before their scheduled departure, Caren Sutton learned
she was pregnant.
   ``She was very nervous about that. They had to reconsider the
trip. They thought about it for a long time and decided to go,''
said her mother, Holly Anderson.
   Caren Sutton, after a first leg of the voyage that gave new
meaning to the term morning sickness, gave birth to Elizabeth, now
7, in Hawaii. Jennifer, now 5, was born in Pago Pago.
   ``It was my husband's dream and I just went along with it,''
Caren Sutton said. ``He did everything, from navigating to operating
the radio. ...I take orders very well, cook and take care of the
children.''
   But her husband said his wife underestimated her role and called
her a ``trouper.''
   The family weathered hurricanes and visited such lands as
Indonesia, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Egypt, Turkey, Tunisia, the Canary
Islands and Panama, Stan Sutton said. Not all was idyllic, however:
The Marinka survived eight storms at sea, including four hurricanes
in 1983.
   Throughout the years, Holly Anderson and Stan Sutton's mother,
Natalie Sutton, visited their children and grandchildren in various
ports around the world and kept in constant touch with them, often
by ham radio.
   While happy he lived his lifelong dream, Stan Sutton was glad to
be home.
   ``These are our freinds and family,'' he said. ``This is the
best. To be back from it all is great.''
   The Suttons also are looking forward to _ for them _ a novel way
of life.
   ``The biggest adventure of all I can think of now is buying a
house, mowing the lawn and watching the kids grow _ doing everything
everybody else is doing, and taking a hot shower every day,'' Stan
Sutton said.

<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa said
Sunday he would not allow international human rights groups into Sri
Lanka to investigate alleged rights abuses.
   Also Sunday, an Information Department statement said 24 people
were killed over the weekend by Sinhalese radicals from the People's
Liberation Front, an ultranationalist guerrilla group seeking to
overthrow the government.
   The victims included five women relatives of security force
personnel, 12 civilians, five soldiers, a doctor and a postal
official, the statement said. It gave no further details.
   Premadasa's declaration regarding human rights came after he met
with a six-member opposition group called the Committee of
Parliamentarians of the Opposition for Fundamental and Human Rights.
   The group urged the president to safeguard human rights, the
statement said. Premadasa said the government was not prepared to
permit international human rights groups, including Amnesty
International, to visit the country.
   He told opposition leaders that ``human rights is not the
preserve of one party or group,'' according to the statement.
   Opposition politicians and human rights groups have accused the
military and pro-government vigilante groups of killing hundreds of
civilians suspected of sympathizing with Sinhalese radicals.
   At least 1,222 people have been killed since June 20, when
Premadasa imposed a state of emergency and gave security forces
special powers.
   In mid-August, the London-based human rights group Amnesty
International appealed to the Sri Lankan government to stem what it
called the rising tide of killings, torture, disappearances and
detentions perpetrated by its forces.
   The government denies the charges and says Sinhalese extremists
are responsible for most of the 5,000 killings reported since the
front began its campaign two years ago.
   The front claims the government made too many concessions to
Tamil secessionists in an India-brokered peace accord of June, 1987.
It also protests the presence of Indian peacekeeping soldiers,
deployed in the northeast under the accord to disarm Tamil militants.
   The front, in letters sent to Colombo newspapers Sunday, accused
the government of killing more than 5,000 people in the last two
years.
   The letters, signed by the group's leader, Rohana Wijeweera,
called upon opposition political parties to unite, saying, ``people
know who is doing the killings and what is taking place in the
country.''
   The statement was the front's first known appeal to political
parties.
   It also warned that people must be ``prepared to make sacrifices
to save their motherland,'' indicating they might enforce another
strike after last week's successful work stoppage.
   Sri Lankan businessmen say a series of radical-enforced strikes
have crippled the country's economy.
   The country's ethnic troubles surfaced in 1983 when the Tamil
minority began demanding a separate nation in the northeast. The
armed insurrection has claimed 11,000 lives, according to government
figures.
   The Tamil community, which comprises 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people, allege discrimination by the majority Sinhalese in
jobs and education. Sinhalese are mostly Buddhists and Tamils are
mostly Hindus.

   A scuba diver was attacked by a shark off
Santa Barbara Island on Sunday and hospitalized in stable condition
with bite wounds to his left forearm and right hand, authorities
said.
   The man was filming sharks and was outside a shark cage when he
was attacked by a blue shark, Coast Guard Petty Officer Robert Beals
said. The name of the 46-year-old man was withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   Coast Guard spokesman Tim Rowe said the man was attacked while
diving 10 miles northwest of the island, about 40 miles southwest of
Los Angeles, and was airlifted from a diving vessel to Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center in Torrance.
   The diver was in stable condition, nursing supervisor Peggy
Kiyuna said, refusing to provide any details.
   A Coast Guard official who refused to give his name said the
Coast Guard station in Ventura received an emergency call from the
dive boat about 11 a.m. Dave Delano, operations manager of the
Village Harbor Marina where the 60-foot boat is based, said Coast
Guard officials apparently talked the boat's crew by radio into
stanching the diver's blood loss. ``I heard that they could not stop
the bleeding and had to use a tourniquet,'' Delano said.
   Delano said the vessel, The Scuba Lover, frequently went on
shark-observing expeditions and had a shark cage on board this trip.
   ``Normally, The Scuba Lover runs what they call Blue Sharks
Expeditions. It's a beautiful shark but not usually dangerous,''
Delano said.
   Beals said the attack was ``very uncommon'' for the Southern
California coast. He had no details on why the diver was outside the
cage.
   In January, a young couple kayaking off Malibu were apparently
killed by a marauding shark, possibly a great white.
   Sailors found the shark-mauled body of Tamara McCallister, 24,
floating six miles off Channel Island Harbor, about 50 miles
northwest of Los Angeles. Her companion, Roy Jeffrey Stoddard, 24,
was never found.
   Such attacks are extremely rare in Southern California. The last
fatal attack in the state was in September 1984 when an abalone
diver was mauled 40 miles south of San Francisco.
   Only six fatal shark attacks were reported between 1926 and 1984
and in five of those deaths the attack was blamed on a great white
shark.

   A short, sharp earthquake jolted the
wine country about 65 miles north of San Francisco on Sunday but
caused no damage or injuries, authorities said.
   The temblor, which occurred at 8:24 a.m., measured 3.2 on the
Richter scale and was centered 7 miles east of here and 10 miles
north of Healdsburg, according to the the National Geological Survey
in Menlo Park. It occurred in the geothermal fields known as The
Geysers.
   Dozens of Sonoma County residents called local authorities to
report the quake.
   The open-ended Richter scale is a measure of the energy released
by an earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a
seismograph.
   Each increase of one number, as in a jump from magnitude 5.5 to
6.5, means that the ground motion is 10 times greater. A quake of
3.5 can cause slight damage in populated areas, while a quake of 6.0
can cause serious damage.

<HEAD>Opposition Complains of Irregularities in Veracruz Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>XALAPA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gulf coast state of Veracruz voted for
state legislators Sunday, and opposition parties said their
representatives were refused access to polls and registration lists
were manipulated.
   One poll watcher was attacked with a machete by a member of the
governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, a spokesman for the
leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party said.
   The spokesman, Wilhem Castillo, said the incident occurred when a
party representative went to a precinct in a small town outside
Misantla, 70 miles northwest of the port of Veracruz. The
seriousness of his injuries was not known, he said.
   ``There were certain irregularities of all types. You know the
kind, they're normal by now,'' said Jose Luis Ochoa, a state
legislator for the conservative National Action Party. ``It's going
to be fraud again.''
   Incidents, including expulsion of poll watchers, were most
frequent in San Andres Tuxtla, Orizaba, Coatzacoalcos and Misantla,
he said. By law, opposition parties are allowed to have
representatives at polling places, but they frequently complain of
accreditation problems.
   Castillo said opposition monitors were not allowed in any of the
10 communities near San Andres Tuxtla.
   Last week, the Leftist Democratic Party said its members were
pared from voter registration lists and voter credentials were
distributed with no control.
   Electoral commission president Miguel Angel Diaz Pedroza asked
for proof of violations.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who took office on Dec. 1,
has pledged elections will be clean and opposition victories will be
recognized.
   The governing party accepted the first gubernatorial loss in its
60-year history on July 2, when the National Action candidate won in
Baja California.
   But accusations continue that it cheated the Democratic
Revolutionary Party out of legislative victories the same day in
Michoacan state.
   Results in several municipal elections in the southern state of
Oaxaca in August also were disputed.
   Transparent ballot boxes were used in Veracruz Sunday for the
first time. About 3 million of the state's 6.3 million people were
eligible to vote.
   Official results were expected in a week.
   The legislature was being increased from 31 to 40 seats, 24 to be
filled by direct election and 16 allotted to minority parties
according to the percentage of the vote they receive. The governing
party currently holds 23 seats.

   State and government leaders from 102
nations are expected for the opening Monday of the ninth summit of
non-aligned nations that will be held at Belgrade's Sava conference
center.
   Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi arrived Sunday and issued a
statement saying, ``If the movement does not modernize, it can be
considered dead.''
   Col. Gadhafi sent in advance a Bedouin tent and four camels and
at a news conference in the tent he suggested the kidnapping of
Westerners in Lebanon was in response to Western intervention in the
Middle East.
   ``I believe Western countries should withdraw from the Middle
East and not intervene in the internal affairs (of those countries)
or else their citizens shall be victims,'' he said.
   He described the Western hostages held by extremists in Lebanon
as ``innocent victims due to the intervention of their respective
governments'' in the Middle East.
   Gadhafi was asked about the possible release of the hostages and
he said if he could help ``I would never delay'' efforts. But he
then added, ``If we knew who kidnapped them we could talk to'' the
abductors.
   Gadhafi, wearing a silk robe, black cape and white turban, spoke
through an interpreter at the news conference that began at 11 p.m.
   He said, ``We do not recognize any U.S. role in any of the
respective (Mideast) countries,'' and that also was true of France
and all other Western nations.
   Eight Americans are among 16 foreign hostages held in Lebanon.
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated
Press, has been held the longest. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Gadhafi's tent was erected in a park in Belgrade's Dedinje suburb.
   Yugoslav President Janez Drnovsek, in an interview published
Saturday, said streamlining the non-aligned movement is the key
issue of the four-day conference. His foreign minister, Budimir
Loncar, said the movement must modernize its political activities.
   For the first time, the movement of leftist, centrist and
conservative leaders is scheduled to deal with human rights.
   After two days of talks, foreign ministers from member countries
early Sunday adopted a main conference document for consideration by
the summit.
   The draft refers to the ``struggle against imperialism,
colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism, apartheid and all forms of
domination.''
   But the Palestine Liberation Organization failed to have included
in the document a condemnation of Zionism.

<HEAD>FDIC Looks to Sell its Share of the Cowboys</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   FORT WORTH _ The Dallas Cowboys are living up to their billing as
``America's team'' _ at least 12 percent of the club is.
   A chunk of the NFL franchise has fallen into the hands of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and officials are looking for a
buyer, according to a Fort Worth newspaper.
   The government gained a stake in the Cowboys when the FDIC helped
NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. take over First Republic Bank Corp. of
Dallas in July 1988.
   First Republic Bank took control of the shares after S. Foster
Yancey Jr., L. Bradley Camp and J.L. Huffines, all of whom were
limited partners in the franchise, encountered financial problems in
their real estate businesses.
   The bank foreclosed and collected the shares, which were pledged
as collateral on loans.
   After the takeover, the bank assumed the name NCNB Texas. The
Cowboys share sale is being handled as part of the bank's agreement
to manage the $5 billion asset pool for the government.
   ``We're certainly looking for a bidder, bank spokesman Joe Bowles
told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. ``We are actively looking for a
buyer.''
   Although the sale price NCNB is seeking is uncertain, sources say
the 12 percent share is worth about $7.2 million, the Fort Worth
newspaper reported.
   That figure is based on H.R. ``Bum'' Bright's sale of his 40
percent general parternship of the Cowboys to Arkansas millionaire
Jerry Jones, who paid $60 million this year to gain controlling
interest of the National Football League team.
   Jones says he controls a 56 percent holding, with 51 percent in
his name and five percent in the name of associate Mike McCoy. The
limited partners are Ed Smith Jr, with 27 percent; Arthur ``Buddy''
Temple, with five percent; and the government, with 12 percent.
   The NFL has to approve any new partner before the government can
complete a sale.
   Jones has told the Star-Telegram that he has ``no plans at this
time'' to acquire the government's stake. Other shareholders said
they plan to keep their shares because investing in the Cowboys is a
good investment.
   ``With new TV rights, a big gate and new radio contract, the
Cowboys could be profitable,'' said John Veatch, managing director
of Salomon Brothers' Dallas operations, who handled Bright's sale of
the team to Jones.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Manuel Esquivel and
former leader George Price conducted a flurry of campagining on the
eve of the nation's general elections Monday.
   All campaigning, including television and radio commercials,
officially ended at midnight Sunday _ seven hours before the polls
open for 11 hours.
   Voters will cast ballots for the 28 seats in the lower house of
the legislature and the party that wins the most seats will name the
prime minister. Terms of office are for five years.
   Esquivel, of the conservative United Democratic Party, said
during the campaign that his administration brought economic
recovery to Belize and efficient government.
   Price, leader of the centrist People's United Party, was defeated
by Esquivel in the 1984 election. His campaign slogan was
``Belizeans first,'' and he accused Esquivel of giving too much to
foreigners to gain investments and tourism.
   Price was the top Belizean official when the country was a
self-governing British colony before it became independent in 1981.
   No public opinion polls were taken but political observers said
they belived Esquivel held a slight edge.
   His party holds 21 seats in the lower house and the United
Democratic Party the remaining seven.
   Elections officials say 82,589 of the country's 160,000 residents
are eligible to vote.
   Initial results are expected about midnight Monday.
   In his criticism of alleged foreign influence, Price attacked a
program that allows foreigners to purchase $25,000 bonds and then
apply for citizenship. If the applicants don't qualify for
citizenship they can redeem the bonds but if they do they can become
citizens and the bond is to be repaid without interest in 10 years.
   The plan is aimed mainly at residents of Hong Kong, a British
colony that is to revert to China in 1997. Many Hong Kong residents
are expected to flee the colony rather than accept control by
communist China.
   Esquivel has said that during the past five years prices for
sugar, fruits and other major exports have been stable and foreign
investments and tourism have doubled.
   Belize has a bicameral legislature with an elected House of
Representatives and appointed Senate. The house determines which
party will form a new government.
   Belize, smaller than Connecticut, is on the Central American
mainland but maintains closer cultural ties with other
English-speaking former British colonies in the Caribbean than with
its Spanish-speaking neighbors.
   Neighboring Guatemala maintains a territorial claim against
Belize, formerly British Honduras, and British troops are stationed
in the country in case of hostilities with Guatemala.

   The psychics' convention here has been
canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.
   The clairvoyants canceled their get-together because an
almost-forgotten 1909 ordinance forbids psychics from practicing
their craft in this central Kansas city.
   Ian Bliss, a psychic from Colorado Springs, Colo., who organized
the fair, called the ordinance archaic and a violation of his civil
liberties.
   Another psychic, Judy Haynes Williams, who moved to the area
three years ago, complained that the ordinance kept her from
advertising her business. She said the city attorney's office told
her the ordinance would be enforced.
   The psychics' cancellation prompted city officials to say Friday
they would consider repealing the law.
   City Commissioner Ron Leslie said he wanted to know why city
fathers passed the ordinance in the first place.
   ``It's difficult for me to visualize that a bunch of people who
get together to talk about ESP represents a major problem,'' he said.

   Drug-related killings of police officers hit a
record high in 1988, but the rate of officer deaths to narcotics
enforcement remains surprisingly low, a private study concludes.
   According to the study issued Sunday by the Washington-based
Crime Control Institute, 14 officers were killed in drug enforcement
activities such as raids, arrests and serving warrants, including
one who was assassinated in New York.
   By contrast, killings of police officers have averaged seven a
year since 1972, when the FBI began publishing narratives on how
police officers died in the line of duty.
   By another measure, the proportion of all police murders
attributable to drugs has risen from 6 percent in 1985 to 18 percent
in 1988, the report said.
   University of Maryland Professor Lawrence W. Sherman, who also
heads the institute, said part of the reason for the increase is the
increased drug enforcement activity.
   Estimated drug arrests have set a record each year since reaching
708,000 in 1984, rising to 1.1 million in 1988, Sherman said. The
numbers of police murders per drug arrest rose from .71 to 100,000
in 1984 to 1.22 per 100,000 in 1988.
   The all-time record rate of drug arrest-related police killings
was in 1976, when 1.96 officers died per 100,000 arrests, followed
by 1980 when there were 1.89 police killings for every 100,000 drug
arrests.
   ``While the risk of death per arrest is still not as high as in
the record years of 1976 and 1980, this trend is still an ominous
one,'' the study said. ``The record levels of drug enforcement,
combined with rising risk levels per arrest, suggest that the total
murders of police in drug enforcement will increase in future
years.''
   Putting the risk in perspective, the report noted that officers
who make two drug arrests a day, 220 days a year, for 25 years will
make only 5,500 drug arrests.
   ``Career drug arrests may total, on average, less than 100 for
the typical officer,'' it said. ``At these levels of drug
enforcement activity, odds of one death per 100,000 drug arrests are
pretty safe bets.''
   Of the killings since 1972, 33 percent happened during undercover
``buy and bust'' operations, 32 percent while serving warrants or
conducting raids, and 5 percent were ``ambushed'' during
surveillance or killed to prevent their testimony.
   Referring to the ambush killings, the report said: ``These cases
are a mere handful compared to the 220 judges and other court
officials slain in Colombia, apparently by drug dealers, since 1981.
But it is striking that four out of six of these U.S. cases occurred
in the period from 1985 through 1988.''
   The study did not count killings outside drug enforcement even if
the killer was under the influence of drugs, was a known or past
drug dealer or in possession of drugs.
   Additionally, the report did not mention non-fatal injuries to
officers.

<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson and United Mine Workers
President Richard Trumka on Sunday blasted the Republican
presidential administrations of the 1980s for what they called a
hostile attitude toward labor.
   ``The 1980s was a decade of great symbolism over substance,''
Jackson said at a day-long rally of about 10,000 people in
southwestern Virginia, where coal miners have been striking the
Pittston Coal Group since early April.
   Many people in the crowd wore camouflage, which has become the
unofficial uniform of striking miners in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky.
   ``During the past 10 years, political leaders such as President
George Bush have used the American flag to pull the wool over our
eyes,'' Jackson told the cheering crowd.
   Jackson accused Bush of defending an American flag that is ``made
in Taiwan'' but not fighting forU.S. textile workers.
   ``Bush stands for solidarity with workers in Poland, but not in
Virginia,'' he said.
   Both Trumka and Jackson said the National Labor Relations Board
has become an instrument for strike-breaking under the Bush and
Reagan administrations.
   ``The 1980s were a shameful, shameful period in our history,''
Trumka said.
   Multi-national corporations have intimidated workers into
submission in recent years, often by moving their plants abroad, he
said.
   The labor movement was unable to fight back because it was
divided, Trumka said. When air traffic controllers went on strike in
1981, ``they fought alone,'' and large corporations saw that as a
sign of weakness in the labor movement, he said.
   Trumka said the 1990s will be better times for the labor movement.
   ``Never again will working people stand alone in a struggle which
threatens their well being.''

   Two jets from the Snowbirds aerobatic team crashed
into Lake Ontario during an air show Sunday after apparently
striking each other, authorities said. One pilot was feared dead and
the other parachuted to safety.
   Divers searched Sunday night for Capt. Shayne Antaya, 24, of
Stratford, Ontario, who went down with his plane and was feared dead.
   Maj. Dan Dempsey of Edmonton, the 36-year-old commander of the
Canadian Forces precision flying team, safely ejected and was
treated briefly at the hospital for facial cuts and leg burns before
being released.
   Witnesses along the Toronto waterfront reported Dempsey's
parachute opened just before a there was a loud explosion and one
plane plunged into the lake within a few hundreds yard of the shore
under clear skies.
   At a news conference Sunday night, Col. Claude Thibault said
Antaya's wife, mother, brother and sister were among thousands of
people watching the show from the shore.
   ``There were four aircraft heading down and three heading up,''
said Oliver Gross of Bramalea, Ontario, who watched the accident
through binoculars. ``It looked like one wingtip hit the other one's
tail, belly to belly.
   ``The one going down went straight into the lake. The other one
attempted to gain altitude and began to swerve off to the right
before it exploded. We saw the pilot eject and the parachute drop.
No pilot came out of the other one.''
   Owen James of Toronto, one of thousands of horrified onlookers,
said, ``The one aircraft just literally disappeared into a complete
ball of flame and black smoke.
   ``They were flying in a fairly close formation, operating away
from the main team.''
   The accident occurred about 1:45 p.m. on the second day of a
three-day air show at the Canadian National Exhibition held along
the waterfront west ot downtown.
   The pilots were performing a stunt called an upward-downward bomb
burst. Canada's nine-member military stunt team performs at more
than 60 air shows throughout North America each year.
   Col. Thibault said the Snowbirds ``are filled with a sense of
loss'' and had suspended future shows.
   Team members fly the CT-114 Tutor, a single-engine jet trainer
used by the military as its basic training aircraft. The plane is
manufactured by Canadair Ltd. of Montreal and has a maximum speed of
nearly 500 mph.
   The Snowbirds' performance includes at least 30 separate
maneuvers.
   Officially known as the 431 Air Demonstration Squadron, it is a
permanent unit of the Canadian Forces based in Moosejaw,
Saskatchewan,
   Before Sunday's tragedy, the Showbirds had three air-show
accidents in which two pilots were killed during the 19 years of
precision flying.
   On Aug. 28, 1988, three jets from the Italian stunt team Freece
Tricolori crashed during an air show at Ramstein U.S. Air Base in
Ramstein, West Germany, killing 70 people.

   Former President
Salvador Jorge Blanco arrived here from Miami Sunday to stand trial
on corruption and perjury charges.
   The trial was suspended in July when Blanco, 63, was allowed to
travel to Miami to accompany his wife, Asela Mera, hospitalized for
a broken ankle suffered during a fall in a stairwell.
   ``I've come to continue with the trial which began April 19 and
demonstrate my innocence,'' Blanco said after arriving.
   He faces charges of corruption and perjury stemming from his
alleged sale to the army of millions of dollars worth of vehicles,
clothing and other equipment at inflated prices during his term in
office which ended in 1986.
   Shortly after he left office, Blanco traveled to Atlanta, for
heart treatment and was sentenced in absentia to 20 years in prison
and fined $16.4 million.
   He returned to the Dominican Republic in November 1988 to appeal
the sentence and was immediately jailed. He was freed on bail July 5
to accompany his wife to Miami.
   Under Dominican law, the former president had the right to a new
trial upon returning to this Caribbean nation.
   The court has already heard testimony from 78 witnesses, and has
yet to hear testimony from Blanco and former Armed Forces Minister
Manuel Antonio Cuervo Gomez, who faces the same charges.
   Two businessmen convicted with Blanco in November, Leonel Almonte
and Juan Tomas Pena Valentin, are serving 20-year prison terms.

   Thousands of angry soccer fans waiving
Chilean flags rallied before the Brazilian Embassy Sunday to protest
a firecracker attack on Chile's goalie during a World Cup qualifying
match in Rio de Janeiro.
   About 4,000 demonstrators chanted ``Chile! Chile!'' and ``Down
with Brazil!'' and one protester burned a Brazilian flag, reporters
said.
   Traffic was halted along the eight-lane boulevard in front of the
embassy as police blocked off the building.
   The three-hour protest was mostly peaceful and there were no
immediate reports of arrests, police said. Demonstrators, however,
broke windows in some buildings near the embassy, police said.
   Scattered protests were reported elsewhere in the city.
   Earlier Sunday in Rio de Janeiro, Goalie Roberto Rojas was hit by
a firecracker 23 minutes into the second half of the match at Rio's
Maracana stadium, when Brazil was ahead 1-0.
   The goalie, bleeding from an inch-long cut in his face, was taken
off the field by his teammates, who refused to return. Brazil, a
three-time world champion, was declared winner of the match.
   A Chilean official said the game would be protested to FIFA, the
international soccer association.

   Jerry Lewis kicked off his 24th annual telethon
for the Muscular Dystrophy Association Sunday night, saying inroads
made against the disease the past three years are ``stunning to the
heart, stunning to the mind.''
   Lewis, opening the 21{-hour telethon from the Jerry Lewis Theater
at the city's Cashman Field Center, said the show, carried by 200
television stations, would reach 100 million people in the United
States and Canada.
   ``We are playing to a lot of people who are becoming fans of what
we do,'' Lewis said. ``That's what makes my kids figure, `Hey, I got
a chance.' If nothing more happens from this program than for my
kids to say, `Hey, I've got a chance,' isn't it worth all the
effort?''
   Lewis introduced his co-hosts for the evening, including singer
Tony Orlando, who recalled advice from his grandmother to ``shoot
for the moon, because the worst that can happen is that you miss and
fall among the stars.''
   Last year's show was watched by about 90 million people in 34.8
million households, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co. The 1988 event
raised a record $41,132,113 and Lewis said in an interview last week
he thought this year's telethon could meet his annual goal of ``one
dollar more.''
   More than 50 stars planned appearances, including Frank Sinatra,
Liza Minnelli, Sammy Davis Jr., Billy Crystal, Alabama, the Oak
Ridge Boys, Robert Goulet, LaToya Jackson, Ringo Starr, Waylon
Jennings and Maureen McGovern.
   Co-hosts include Davis, Ed McMahon, Casey Kasem, Julius La Rosa
and Norm Crosby.
   Lewis has been a spokesman for the New York City-based Muscular
Dystrophy Association for 40 years and held the annual Labor Day
weekend telethons since 1966.
   They have raised $484 million, and the money is paying dividends,
Lewis said, with medical science starting to unlock the mysteries of
40 neuromuscular diseases that cripple thousands annually.
   Lewis said the 1989 telethon has special meaning for him.
   This spring Lewis and his wife, Sam, 38, learned she was
pregnant. On May 5, two months into the pregnancy, they learned that
the fetus' heart had stopped beating. Lewis, 63, has six sons by a
previous marriage.
   Lewis said his loss cannot compare to the trials faced by parents
who lose a child after years of suffering, but now he has new
understanding of their plight.
   ``I thought I knew what I was talking about,'' Lewis said,
recalling decades of relating to parents whose children die of
muscular dystrophy.
   Lewis also said he was ``shocked and saddened'' by the death last
week of the Rev. Paul O'Conner, a Catholic priest from Detroit who
was to appear on the telethon to describe his battle with one of the
diseases MDA hopes to cure.
   O'Conner flew to Las Vegas Thursday and was hospitalized later in
the day after suffering breathing problems. He died Friday of
respiratory complications from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known
as Lou Gehrig's disease because it took the life of the famed
baseball player.
   A film chronicling O'Conner's battle with the disease was to be
shown on the telethon.

   A passenger on a commuter flight
suffered a minor gunshot wound to the head Sunday when his plane was
fired upon while landing at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International
Airport, authorities said.
   The 1:40 p.m. EDT shooting occurred as the twin-engine, turboprop
plane arriving from the Bahamas came in on final approach. USAir
Flight 4343 was carrying 16 passengers and three crew members,
airport officials said.
   Edward Clark Wright, 42, of Dove Canyon, Calif., said he heard a
popping noise before feeling a bump on his head, said Jim Leljedal,
spokesman for the Broward Sheriff's Office.
   ``He first thought something had fallen and struck him, but he
saw nothing,'' the spokesman said. ``When Wright touched his head
with his hand, he found that he was bleeding.''
   Wright was taken to Broward General Medical Center, where he was
treated for a superficial scalp wound and released, Leljedal said.
   After Wright was discharged from the hospital, he joined his wife
and two daughters on their return trip to California, the spokesman
said.
   ``Further examination of the aircraft revealed that the bullet
entered through an exit door on the plane's right side, ricocheted
off the top of the cabin and hit the victim,'' Leljedal said.
   Sheriff's deputies on foot and in the air searched just west of
the airport, but no suspects or witnesses to the shooting were
found, Leljedal said. The FBI has entered the investigation.

<HEAD>488 Kurdish Refugees Leave Camp To Return To Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUS, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 488 Kurdish refugees left their
camp in this southeastern province to return to Iraq voluntarily,
the semi-official Anatolia news agency reported Sunday.
   The agency quoted Mus Governor Adil Yazar as saying the group
left the camp in three trucks and five buses Saturday night and
would leave the country through the Habur border gate.
   A group of 380 Kurdish refugees returned to Iraq last month.
   The Kurds are an ethnic minority of 20 million living in Turkey,
Iran, and Iraq and small enclaves of 500,000 each in Syria and the
Soviet Union.
   The Iraqi government has been accused of forcibly evacuating
thousands of Kurds from their homes, razing towns in the northern
Kurdish homeland and resettling Kurds in the south of the country.
   The government says the resettlement is to improve life for the
impoverished Kurds.
   Last year, Iraqis dropped poison gas on the Kurdish town of
Halabja, killing an estimated 4,000 civilians. The Kurds claim
thousands more were killed in similar chemical weapons attacks last
fall.
   Following the attacks by the Iraqi army, about 60,000 Kurds fled
to Turkey. Some have since gone to Iran and a few thousand have
returned to Iraq.
   About 40,000 remain in tent camps and crowded apartment houses in
southeast Turkey.

   Tragedy blighted Labor Day weekend festivities when a stunt truck
ran into a crowd of spectators at a New Hampshire state fair Sunday,
injuring 23. In Florida, a woman was killed when a powerboat sliced
through her houseboat.
   On Saturday, five motorcyclists headed to a Labor Day festival in
northern California were killed when a flatbed truck spilled a load
of firewood and turned over in front of them. Four others were
injured in the fiery crash in the Sierra Nevada.
   At the state fair in Hopkinton, N.H., a pickup truck performing
in a stunt act crashed through a fence and hit a fried dough stand
shortly after 5 p.m., scattering injured people on the ground before
thousands of spectators.
   ``I heard the crash, I looked up and, oh, people were flying all
over the place,'' concessionaire Dave Richards said.
   State police Lt. Dave McCarthy said the only fatality was the
62-year-old truck driver from Mifflintown, Pa., and they were
investigating the possibility that he suffered a medical problem
before the crash.
   Hopkinton Police Chief Ira Migdal said six of the 23 injured were
admitted to Concord Hospital, two to the intensive care unit. Among
the injured were four children and four teen-agers, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   ``The majority of injuries that I saw appeared to be very
serious,'' Migdal said. Police withheld identification of the driver
until relatives were notified.
   In Miami, Barbara Basford, 38, of Jacksonville was killed when a
speeding powerboat sliced through a houseboat she was sleeping in
early Sunday on the dark, shallow waters off Islamorada in the
Florida Keys.
   The driver apparently saved his life by ducking seconds before
his 18-foot, fiberglass fishing boat knifed through the sheet-metal
walls of the houseboat and emerged intact on the other side, said
Coast Guard Petty Officer John Sewell.
   ``If he hadn't ducked, it would have probably cut him in two from
the waist up,'' Sewell said. ``It's a wonder he came out as good as
he did.''
   Basford suffered fatal internal injuries when the boat passed
directly over the couch where she was sleeping, said Lt. Bruce
Buckson of the Florida Marine Patrol.
   In other accidents over the Labor Day weekend:
   _ A Middletown, Conn., man and his father were badly burned
Saturday night when their 30-foot cabin cruiser exploded near the
Niantic River Bridge, destroying the boat, police said.
   Daniel Morse, 32, was in critical condition Sunday with burns
over 45 percent of his body at Bridgeport Hospital. His father,
Ralph Morse Sr., 71, of Springfield, Mass., was in good condition at
Lawrence and Memorial Hospital.
   _ In Barnesville, Ga., three people were killed Sunday when a
fire _ apparently deliberately set _ swept through a camping
trailer, authorities said. The victims were not immediately
identified.
   ``From the appearance, in the investigation we did ... it is
probable that some accelerant was used because of the extreme heat''
in the fire, said Georgia Bureau of Investigation Agent Roy Harris,
adding that the deaths are being investigated as possible homicides.
   _ A 26-year-old man died and his 47-year-old father was seriously
injured when their aluminum boat was struck by lightning Sunday
afternoon while they fishing at Perry Lake near Crosby, Minn.,
authorities said.
   Their names were withheld pending notification of relatives.

   A commercial helicopter collided with a small
plane above a rural subdivision Sunday night, killing all three
people aboard both aircraft and scattering debris over the
neighborhood, authorities said.
   Two people in the helicopter and the woman pilot of the
single-engine plane were killed in the crash about 6:45 p.m., about
a mile from the Houma-Terrebonne Airport, said police Capt. John
Dixon.
   ``I heard the crash. It was a loud bang, like two cars hitting
real hard,'' said Ken Domangue, a part-time photographer for the
Houma Courier newspaper. ``Then I walked around the trees and I saw
what looked like one fairly large plane coming down. Then they
separated, and one went one way and one went the other.''
   ``They were smoking as they fell. When they hit the ground, there
was a puff of black smoke and then flames,'' Domangue said.
   ``No houses were hit, but debris was scattered all across the
neighborhood _ helicopter blades, a seat cushion a couple of hundred
feet away. Registration papers from the Cessna fell in my front
yard,'' he said.
   The victims' identities were not immediately known, but a company
official acknowledged one of the aircraft belonged to Petroleum
Helicopters Inc., which serves the offshore oil industry.
   Petroleum Helicopters Inc. vice president-general manager Carl
Dougherty said the helicopter, which crashed soon after takeoff, was
only on a three-mile flight.
   Dixon said the helicopter crashed and burned in an intersection
just outside Houma's southern city limits and the plane crashed into
a tree, but there were neither injuries nor damages on the ground.
   Dixon said the collision was being investigated by the Terrebonne
Parish Sheriff's Department, but neither the sheriff nor any of his
employees would comment immediately.
   Dougherty said he would not identify the helicopter's passengers
until their relatives are notified. He said National Transportation
Safety Board investigators were expected to arrive Monday morning.

   Still-growing Hurricane Gabrielle was storming
westward across the open Atlantic Ocean on Sunday with maximum winds
of 125 mph, but posed no immediate threat to land, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was located near 17.1 north
latitude and 52.2 west longitude, about 640 miles east of the Lesser
Antilles in the West Indies. It was moving west-northwest at 17 mph
and was expected to continue that course and speed through noon
Monday.
   ``There's nothing standing in the way of further strengthening
over the next day or two,'' said Max Mayfield, forecaster at the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``But it's still
too soon to tell what kind of problems it may cause. It's more than
a day away from the nearest land.''
   Mayfield said it's an unusually large hurricane, with an eye 20
miles across and a total size up to 350 miles across.
   Gabrielle, the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic season, formed
Thursday off the African coast and its winds quickly surpassed
minimum hurricane force of 74 mph.
   Tropical Storm Felix was drifting westerly far to the north and
was expected to gradually turn toward the northwest by Monday.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of Felix was near 34.2 north
latitude and 45.4 west longitude, or about 840 miles southwest of
the westernmost Azores.
   Its winds were estimated at about 40 mph, just above the 39-mph
threshold for it to retain its name, and little change in strength
was expected through noon Monday, forecasters said.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of young people here for a
Labor Day weekend fraternity gathering went on a rampage down the
main thoroughfare of this resort city early Sunday, firing shots and
looting more than 100 stores.
   After a tense but uneventful day in which store owners cleaned up
gutted storefronts, police turned out at mid-evening in riot gear
and cleared the streets, arresting dozens more young people during a
35-minute sweep.
   Two men were wounded by gunshots in the earlier confrontation
with police, and at least two others were injured, authorities said.
   City officials say some of the estimated 100,000 young people who
clogged the resort strip looted more than 100 stores along Atlantic
Avenue, the city's main beachfront thoroughfare.
   Police said 160 people were arrested and brought into the station
between Friday evening and early Sunday evening, and 395 others had
been issued citations for various offenses. They did not have a
breakdown of the kinds of arrests.
   At the request of city officials, Gov. Gerald L. Baliles
dispatched a military police detachment from the National Guard and
state police troopers to the area.
   ``It is a local law enforcement situation and it is being managed
by city officials and state police officials who are on the scene,''
said Baliles' press secretary, Chris Bridge.
   She said Baliles ``is receiving state police briefings and
reports on _ I don't know if its an hourly basis _ but he's received
several reports today.''
   At 8 p.m. Sunday, city officials closed the downtown beach area
to incoming traffic. State and local police patrolled the area on
foot and by helicopter.
   Several people threw bottles at state troopers, who began making
arrests, and onlookers taunted National Guardsmen who marched
through city streets, armed with batons and assault rifles.
   Shortly after 9:30 p.m., about 75 Virginia Beach police officers
formed a wedge and began moving south on Atlantic Avenue, which runs
parallel to the oceanfront one block away.
   The Virginia Beach officers were followed by a state police
armored truck, which announced over a public address system that the
approximately 350 young people in the street represented an unlawful
assembly.
   Officers were pelted with bottles as they walked along the street
and made arrests. Several officers who went into an adjoining motel
parking lot to arrest someone were showered by bottles thrown from a
balcony above.
   By 10:05, Atlantic Avenue was empty except for several hundred
police officers. Dozens were arrested during the course of the
35-minute sweep.
   The initial disturbances began around 2 a.m. and stretched along
a 30-block section of the street, police said.
   A witness said police had attempted to disperse groups of
fraternity students, most from predominantly black colleges along
the East Coast, who were showing off dance steps on Atlantic Avenue.
At one point in the fracas, police lobbed a smoke bomb into a crowd
of people.
   ``It's been like we're being singled out because we are young and
black,'' said Charles Stone, 23, of New York City.
   City officials were considering imposing a curfew to prevent
further violence. In addition, the city has asked state officials to
suspend the sale of alcohol in the city until Tuesday.
   ``I can assure you that this type of behavior is not condoned and
will not be tolerated now or in the future,'' said Mayor Meyera E.
Oberndorf. She declined to answer questions, saying she did not have
details.
   The majority of the mob were college students in town for the
annual Labor Day weekend Greekfest for members of fraternities and
sororities, authorities said. During last year's Greekfest, police
were forced to clear smaller groups of young people from the street.
   Some witnesses said police overreacted to the students'
activities.
   ``They've been trying to regulate things that don't need
regulating,'' said Paul Williams, a 21-year-old Temple University
student who said he watched the confrontation begin from his motel
balcony.
   ``Last year, everything was real nice. There was no violence ...
but this year the place was jammed with police and they were
hassling people,'' he said.
   They said police formed a ``V'' with six to eight mounted
officers backed by police in riot gear, and began moving south down
Atlantic pushing students off the street and sidewalks with clubs.
   Several witnesses said they saw tear gas or a smoke bomb fired to
disperse the crowd.
   City officials first said neither was used. Later, they said a
smoke bomb was fired into the crowd to indicate wind direction
should tear gas be necessary.
   Diane Roche, a spokeswoman for the city, said tear gas was not
used, nor were any shots fired by police. She said police were
unsure what set off the incident.
   By the time order was restored Sunday morning along the
beachfront avenue of hotels and shops, merchants said it looked
chaotic.
   ``I didn't know these kinds of things existed,'' said Arnie Cohen
whose Atlantic Avenue shop was spared. A jewelry story next door was
looted, its display cases left shattered on the sidewalk.
   Merchants and city crews cleaned up the damage Sunday under the
eyes of flak-jacketed MPs armed with assault rifles. By 6 p.m., the
National Guardsmen were off the street and the sidewalks were
crowded with visitors. Police in riot gear were on most street
corners.
   ``We just hope we can make it through tonight,'' said Bobbi
Basnight of Logo Lil's, a T-shirt shop. Though her shop was not
damaged, Ms. Basnight did not plan to reopen this weekend.
   ``We tried to welcome these people. We'd been hearing rumors all
week that something was going to happen,'' she said.
   Denise Pinto and Maria Badinno stood in the ruins of a clothing
store. Of the 7,000 garments in the store, 100 were left about the
floor.
   The only things left on the shelves were signs warning that
shoplifters would be prosecuted.
   ``It's awful. ... We don't even have our cash register,'' Ms.
Pinto said.
   Police closed off Atlantic Avenue through most of Sunday.
Merchants said they were losing business in what is generally the
best weekend of the year for resort merchants. Traditionally, the
Labor Day weekend is the grand finale of the summer beachgoing
season.
   ``It's a major loss,'' Ms. Basnight said. ``We would have made
about $3,000. Now it's down to zero.''
   Brenda Kanz, front desk manager at the Kona Kai Motel on Atlantic
Avenue, said Sunday morning that authorities were not allowing
guests to leave the motel unless they were checking out to go home.
   ``This is a heck of a way to end the season,'' she said.
   A nursing supervisor at Sentara-Norfolk General Hospital, who
asked not to be identified, said shooting victim John Thomas, 28, of
Forestville, Md., was in stable condition. The other wounded man,
Charles Robinson, 25, of Roselle, N.Y., was listed in fair condition
at Virginia Beach Hospital.
   Authorities said two other people were also injured, but it was
not clear if those injuries were related to the riot. One man was in
critical condition with ijuries suffered when he fell from the
fourth floor of a hotel, while another was critically injured in a
car accident near the area where the riot occurred.
   In 1986, a crowd of unruly college and high school students on
spring break rampaged through Palm Springs, Calif., pelting police
with rocks and bottles.
   Beer-drinking youths on the crowded main boulevard of the desert
resort dumped water into passing cars, and ripped bathing suit tops
off of several young women during the melee, which lasted several
hours.
   Since then, police have called in reinforcements to monitor
spring break crowds and make hundreds of arrests for relatively
minor offenses such as public drunkenness, but there has been no
repeat of the violence.

   A baby sperm whale, rarely found in the
Gulf of Mexico, was being cared for Sunday at Sea Arama Marineworld
after the whale beached itself near Sabine Pass.
   The 13-foot, 900-pound calf was found Saturday on the Bolivar
Peninsula, said Marineworld spokeswoman Christy Benson. ``It is only
a baby, about a week old,'' she said.
   Voluneers helped hoist it onto a flatbed truck, where it was
covered with wet cloths and sunscreen for the trip to the aquarium.
   Ms. Benson said 99 percent of all mammals that beach themselves
are dying. However, the whale seemed to be doing pretty well.
   ``When we determine that he is healthy, we will return him to the
sea,'' she told the Galveston News.
   However, the whale had not been weaned and there was no sign of
its mother. So Marineworld experts were feeding it with a nutrient
solution.
   Fully grown, sperm whales can reach 50 feet in length.

   A gunman disabled an automatic bank
machine, waited for repair workers to arrive, held them up and made
off with $150,000 from the machine, police said Sunday.
   Police are still searching for the robber, who forced two BayBank
workers to open the back of a money machine, then looted it of cash.
``He tied them up and cleaned out the machine,'' said Police Lt.
Donald Sjostedt.
   Investigators are studying photo tapes taken during transactions
before Saturday's robbery, he said.
   Sjostedt said police believe the money machine was broken
intentionally by the thief in order to bring repair workers. A
faulty machine activates a signal in the bank's central system.
   The employees were returning to their car around midnight when
the gunman wearing a stocking mask and gloves pointed a revolver at
them and herded them back to the machine in a shopping plaza.
   The thief escaped in a car belonging to one of the bank workers,
but it was found abandoned on Route 3.
   After freeing themselves, the bank workers set off an alarm in
the bank machine, bringing police to the scene about 10 minutes
after the robbery.
   A spokesman for the Boston office of the FBI said the method used
in the theft was unusual.
   ``There have been robberies at teller machines,'' he said, ``but
I don't think anything like this has every happened. It was pretty
significant.''
