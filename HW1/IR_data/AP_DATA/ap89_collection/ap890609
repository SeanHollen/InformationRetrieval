<HEAD>S&amp;L Compromise Threatened by Partisan Fighting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Partisan disputes over Jim Wright's ethics and
Republican opposition to a key reform threaten President Bush's plan
to protect depositors from $100 billion in losses by failed savings
and loans.
   The debate is taking on a more political tinge as the full House
prepares to deal with the bill next week.
   House GOP leaders threatened on Thursday to blame the financial
crisis _ the largest in the nation since the Depression _ on
influence peddling for S&amp;Ls by the fallen House speaker and fellow
Democratic leader Tony Coelho. Both Wright and Coelho are leaving
the House under fire on ethics issues.
   Democrats, meanwhile, began making an issue of GOP House members'
opposition to the reforms that Bush has requested. The Republicans
are trying to weaken a key reform that Bush says is needed to
prevent a similar debacle in the future _ requiring S&amp;L owners to
put up more of their own money when making speculative loans.
   Bush's proposal calls for total spending and borrowing, including
interest over the next 30 years, of $285 billion. The money would
guarantee that depositors will not lose any money because of risky
and often fraudulent lending by S&amp;L operators in recent years.
   Of that bailout total, about $157 billion, or 55 percent, will
come from taxpayers _ ``about $600 for every man, woman and child in
this country,'' according to the General Accounting Office.
   Through four months of congressional action including Senate
passage of Bush's proposal, Democrats and Republicans studiously
avoided blaming the other.
   ``Nobody wanted to point a finger because there would be three
pointed right back at him,'' said Rep. Richard Lehman, D-Calif., a
member of the House Banking Committee.
   But there were several signs of finger-pointing Thursday.
   Rep. Marcy Kaptur, D-Ohio, using a cartoon of Bush as a prop on
the House floor, called his bailout proposal ``the biggest tax
increase in recent memory.''
   The cartoon was captioned ``Read my FSLIC'' and portrayed Bush as
talking out of both sides of his mouth in promising no new taxes
while committing taxpayers to more than $150 billion in interest
costs.
   FSLIC stands for the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp.,
the agency that insures depositors against losses up to $100,000
each. It now has an estimated deficit of $55 billion that is growing
by $10 million a day.
   GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia warned Democrats to be ``very,
very cautious'' in trying to blame Bush for the costs of the bailout.
   He threatened to use next week's debate to rehash charges in a
report by the House Ethics Committee on Wright, D-Texas, and a book
by Wall Street Journal reporter Brooks Jackson on Coelho, D-Calif.
   ``I am prepared to go through all next week and say nothing about
any of that,'' he added. ``But if there's going to be any bashing of
George Bush and the Republican Party, I want Democrats to understand
we are fully prepared to talk about how the mess got so big and who
was responsible.''
   More than one-third of the Ethics Committee report on Wright was
devoted to his intervention in 1986 and 1987 on behalf of now
insolvent Texas S&amp;Ls that the FSLIC was trying to close.
   Jackson's book, ``Honest Graft,'' deals with how Coelho raised
money from S&amp;L operators for Democratic candidates in the 1986 and
1988 elections while leading the fight against making the industry
pay higher insurance premiums to cover the mounting losses.
   Wright stepped down Tuesday as the House's speaker and announced
he would give up his seat in Congress by the end of the month rather
than face a hearing before the ethics committee on charges unrelated
to the S&amp;L crisis.
   Coelho announced two weeks ago that he would resign June 15 from
his seat and as whip, the No. 3 Democratic office in the House,
after a $50,000 loan from a California S&amp;L to him for buying junk
bonds was exposed.
   According to government auditors, more than 60 percent of the
estimated $100 billion in S&amp;L losses that the government is expected
to have to cover stem from thrift banks in Texas and California.
   Many House Republicans are bucking Bush by trying to weaken the
key industry reform in his package _ making S&amp;L operators put more
of their own money at risk to prevent overly risky lending.
   GOP Reps. Henry Hyde of Illinois, James Quillen of Tennessee and
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania are spearheading a movement to exempt 240
to 750 of the nation's 2,949 thrifts from new capital standards that
would require them to raise $6 billion by 1995 as a shield against
the need for another taxpayer bailout.
   ``So far, it look like the Republicans are more interested in
weakening the president's own bill and the Democrats more interested
in helping him,'' said Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio. ``If President
Bush wants a strong savings and loan bill then he very clearly is
going to have to deliver Republican votes to help make that a
reality.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: China Events a Personal Disappointment to Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, that old China hand, summed up
a large part of his frustration over the chaos in China: ``I feel a
certain sense of personal disappointment.''
   Even his phone calls aren't getting through these days.
   Bush, U.S. envoy to Beijing in the mid-1970s and proud of his
knowledge of China, repeatedly voiced feelings of hopelessness _
even despair _ as he fielded questions Thursday night at his first
prime-time news conference.
   ``In terms of trying to figure out their internal order, it is
extraordinarily difficult,'' Bush conceded.
   When Bush served in China for 16 months in the Ford
administration, it was a lot easier to tell who was in and who was
out of power.
   ``We'd send people out around town to count the red flag
limousines, and then they'd say, oh, there's 30 of them gathered
here. There must be an important meeting.
   ``And everybody would hover around trying to see who emerged or
who stood next to somebody on a parade on Festival Day.''
   Things now are infinitely more complex, Bush conceded.
   Asked to clarify a remark suggesting that senior Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping may not necessarily have been responsible for last
weekend's bloody military crackdown, Bush showed a trace of
exasperation:
   ``I was trying to say that I don't know. And I'm trying to say
that you don't know.''
   Pointing around the East Room to different reporters at random,
he added: ``And he doesn't know, and she doesn't know and nobody
knows _ outside.''
   Still, Bush's remarks Thursday night showed he was staying the
cautious course he outlined earlier, despite the continued
repression in China and in the face of calls by some conservatives
in Congress for sharper action.
   Bush said he was sticking by his decision to suspend arms sales
to China and not to escalate the U.S. response further by imposing
trade or other economic sanctions.
   ``I am one who lived in China; I understand the importance of the
relationship with the Chinese people and with the government. It is
in the interest of the United States to have good relations,'' he
said.
   Bush, who visited China four months ago and met with the
country's leaders in the first overseas trip of his presidency, was
asked whether he felt personally let down by the brutal events of
the past week.
   ``I feel a certain sense of personal disappointment,'' he said.
He said the Chinese government had violated internationally accepted
norms of behavior: ``Armed people don't shoot down unarmed
students.''
   He said the United States couldn't have ``totally normal
relations'' again unless the government _ whichever government is
running things _ recognizes ``the validity of the students'
aspirations.''
   And why, given his good past relations with Deng and other
Chinese leaders, didn't he just pick up the phone and try to talk to
them?
   The answer was almost sheepish. ``I tried today. ... The line was
busy. I couldn't get through.''
   If Bush was voicing frustration in deciding how to deal with the
political situation in China, he showed no such hesitation on the
human rights issue.
   After drawing criticism from some quarters when he failed to
speak up for human rights during that February trip to China, Bush
sounded a much stronger note on that score during Thursday's news
conference.
   ``We have to speak out in favor of human rights. We aren't going
to remake the world, but we should stand for something. And there's
no question in the minds of these students that the United States is
standing in their corners,'' he said.
   Bush added that, ``the United States must stand wherever, in
whatever country, universally for human rights.'' He also mentioned
South Africa, declaring: ``Appalling apartheid must end.''
   The president also gave the human rights theme a personal
dimension when he defended the U.S. decision to harbor Chinese
dissident Fang Lizhi in the U.S. embassy in Beijing.
   Fang, the outspoken astrophysicist who was barred by police from
attending a barbecue thrown by Bush in Beijing in February, wound up
as the embassy's uninvited _ but welcome _ house guest.
   ``It is awful hard for the United States, when a man presents
himself _ a person who is a dissident _ and says that his life is
threatened, to turn him back,'' Bush said.
   ``That isn't one of the premises upon which the United States was
founded,'' he added.

   When Marie Hartley whistles, people can't help
listening.
   It was her piercing blast _ with right thumb and forefinger
pinched in front of her teeth _ that won Ms. Hartley a leading role
in the National Symphony Orchestra's current performances of Sergei
Prokofiev's ``Ivan the Terrible'' in the Kennedy Center Concert Hall.
   It was at the first rehearsal of the music that Prokofiev
originally wrote for Sergei Eisenstein's 1940s film classic that Ms.
Hartley, an alto with the 180-voice Choral Arts Society of
Washington, attracted the attention of conductor Mstislav
Rostropovich.
   The orchestra and singers had begun practicing the ``Song of
Fyodor Basmanov and the Tsar's Men,'' the rowdy chorus of drunken
soldiers in a tavern courtyard, when Rostropovich tapped his baton
and announced that he need a whistler.
   A few male singers whistled unimpressively. ``Then I thought, oh,
they need a whistler?'' Ms. Hartley said. ``So I really let it go.
He stopped and said, `Who did that?' I raised my hand and he said,
`You, you're the whistler.'''
   Later in the week, another five singers had been judged loud
enough to make up a chorus of whistlers, but Ms. Hartley remained
the virtuoso.
   Her whistle is not for gently summoning the family dog. It's more
appropriate for hailing a taxi three blocks away in rush-hour
traffic, or overcoming the hellish racket at a rock concert.
   The athletic Ms. Hartley, a 26-year-old massage therapist,
special education teacher and champion Frisbee player from suburban
Bethesda, Md., is at a loss to remember how or why she began
whistling so expertly.
   ``I don't know,'' she said, ``I've always been able to do it.''
It just came to her, probably about the time she also taught herself
to juggle softballs while waiting for the referees to show up for a
high school game.
   The other whistlers in the chorus, practicing informally before a
recent backstage rehearsal with the orchestra, demonstrated that
there's more than one way to split an eardrum.
   While Ms. Hartley whistles by forming a circle with thumb and
forefinger on one hand, freelance writer Kandy Stroud tucks an
extended finger from each hand into her mouth, just as she learned
from a childhood chum on a backyard swing.
   Lawyer Toni LeBel uses a different technique to stop taxis on
downtown streets. She shoves four fingers into her mouth, two from
each hand. But psychologist Richard Plies doesn't use any fingers.
He merely whistles with his lips and tongue, which is the way he
answered his father's call to the dinner table as a boy.
   Ms. Hartley's championship women's Frisbee team is called
``Satori,'' a Zen Buddhist term meaning enlightenment or _ in her
liberal translation _ ``being at one with the Frisbee.''
   ``That's the way I whistle,'' she said. ``I'm at one with my
whistling.''

   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell says
Congress should set aside its concern about starting another public
furor and consider gradually raising its salaries while phasing out
speaking fees.
   Mitchell said the voter resentment toward congressional salary
raises that derailed a 50 percent increase earlier this year
complicates efforts to reform ethics on Capitol Hill. But he said
lawmakers must confront the issue anyway.
   Members of Congress must ``find the proper balance between being
responsive to the wishes of the electorate and applying one's best
conscience and judgment as to what is best for the nation or the
state as a whole,'' he said.
   ``We are caught in a vise between tremendous attention devoted to
honoraria, in the press ... and a public wholly disinterested in
honoraria.''
   Mitchell's comments in an interview Thursday echoed statements
made earlier in the week by new House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash.
   Foley said he hopes the House will act before year's end on a new
ethics package, and that the proposals probably will have to address
the honoraria issue.
   Mitchell voiced interest in a bill, introduced by Sen.
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., which would phase out speaking fees while
gradually phasing in increases in lawmakers salaries.
   ``Several senators, both Democrat and Republican, have expressed
to me that that's the only reasonable approach ... which some feel
is the way out of a difficult situation,'' he said.
   Members of the House and Senate are paid $89,500 a year, although
the top leaders make more than that. Both the House and Senate, by
overwhelming margins, defeated the proposed 50 percent pay raise
early this year after a public outcry greeted the proposal.
   ``We do have a problem. We have to act. We will act,'' Mitchell
said. He added that while skepticism about public officials is
healthy, ``a danger occurs when skepticism becomes cynicism and
mistrust.''
   The senator said one option would be to gradually lower limits on
speech fees, known as honoraria, while gradually increasing
congressional salaries.
   Mitchell did not allude to the announced resignations of House
Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, and Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of
California. Some of the allegations against Wright concerned rules
on honoraria, while Coelho has been criticized for a private
investment deal.
   Democratic and Republican task forces in the Senate are studying
proposals for ethics reform, he said.
   Mitchell said lawmakers cannot wait for a go-ahead from their
constituents.
   ``If prevailing public sentiment were the sole determining
factor, the pay of members of Congress today would be exactly what
it was 200 years ago,'' he said.
   Mitchell said he would not set any ``arbitrary deadline'' for
recommending ethics changes, saying it is more important to find
agreement on rules that provide ``more precise and definite
standards'' for lawmakers. He said a review also is needed of rules
concerning acceptance of gifts, a central issue in the ethics case
against Wright.

<HEAD>Justice Objects to Scope of Request on Civil Rights Nominee</HEAD>

   The Justice Department says a Senate committee
is demanding some 200,000 pages of documents on William Lucas,
nominated to head the department's civil rights division.
   ``It seems to me it would take years for the Senate staff to
review all this material,'' Justice Department spokesman David
Runkel said Thursday, adding that the amount of paperwork requested
was ``unusual.''
   However, a source with the Senate Judiciary Committee denied that
the staff is seeking that many documents.
   ``We have not asked for something broad, but for something pretty
narrow ... but apparently the way the records are kept, they're in a
much broader category,'' said the source, who spoke only on
condition of anonymity. ``We might want perhaps 10 pages out of 100,
but they'll give us 100.''
   Among the requested items are unpublished decisions in Michigan
state courts, the source said, adding, ``The only way to get them is
to have him (Lucas) find them.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh questioned Judiciary Committee
Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., about the requests Wednesday
night when Thornburgh spoke to the Delaware State Bar Association.
   ``He said something like, `They're asking for a lot of stuff,'''
and he urged Biden to schedule Lucas' confirmation hearings as soon
as possible, Runkel said.
   The committee source said the department has assured the
committee that it will cooperate in providing documents and said
Biden has said repeatedly that he has no interest in delaying the
hearing and hopes it can be held before the July 4 holiday.
   Runkel said the committee is seeking such things as employment
records and court documents ``on cases that may have been filed in
which he, as a public official, may have been a defendant.''
   Lucas, who is working for the Justice Department as a $284-a-day
consultant while awaiting Senate confirmation, did not respond to
phone calls seeking comment.
   Some civil rights groups have opposed his nomination, saying he
lacks legal experience, particularly on civil rights. On his Senate
questionnaire, Lucas said he has never tried a case in court since
he entered private legal practice in Detroit two years ago.
   Prior to private practice, Lucas had served as sheriff and chief
executive of Wayne County, Mich.
   A black Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor
in 1986, Lucas had been a lifelong Democrat before joining the GOP
in 1985.

   A sailboat that sank here
2,400 years ago may be the first vessel ever found that was built by
the Phoenicians, an ancient people famed for their sophisticated
ships and mastery of the sea.
   The craft, about the size of a modern racing yacht, sank about 75
yards off this communal agricultural farm in northern Israel,
archaeologists said.
   Among the items aboard the vessel were a master craftsman's
toolbox with a drill, a carpenter's square, a heart-shaped jewelry
box and a cooking pot still covered with soot, they said.
   Jay Rosloff, the project's field director, told reporters this
week it was too soon to establish the vessel's origin with certainty.
   But he added: ``If I had to put money on it, I'd say it was
Phoenician.''
   ``During these times in this area, Phoenicians had a virtual
franchise on shipping,'' he said.
   He said no Phoenician shipwreck has previously been found.
   The Phoenicians were the most famous seafarers of the ancient
world and dominated the Mediterranean with their trade. They emerged
about 1,000 B.C. and survived until Roman times.
   Rosloff said another early boat, a Greek vessel, was discovered
off the Turkish-Cypriot port of Kyrenia. Although it was built 150
year later than the sailboat found here, it was not as sophisticated.
   The shipwright who built the vessel used iron instead of copper
nails common in Greek vessels and employed an elaborate technique
called scarfing in which wooden pieces are fitted together.
   ``This craft has so many quirks that are different (from the
Greek vessel) that it indicates a different cultural milieu,'' said
Rosloff as he stood on the beach next to an actual-size outline of
the hull built with sandbags.
   The vessel is 10 yards long, three yards wide and about two yards
high from keel to deck. Most of the hull has been preserved, but the
masts, sails and cabin have been lost.
   The boat was built around 450 B.C. and was in its first season,
possibly on its maiden voyage, when it sank, said Elisha Linder, who
heads the project run by Haifa University's Center for Maritime
Studies. He said the hull showed little wear.
   He speculated that the sailors got too close to shore than was
safe because they were hiding from pirates or seeking shelter from a
storm. A large chunk is missing from the hull, indicating the boat
sank after hitting a rock or reef.
   For 2,400 years, the vessel was covered by sand and hidden from
view. But in 1985, currents briefly washed away some of the sand,
and kibbutz member Avi Eshel caught a glimpse of pottery scraps and
ballast stones while diving with his daughter.
   Linder had just completed his fifth fruitless summer hunting for
Phoenician shipwrecks in Italy when he got word about the find in
Magan Michael, where he lives.
   ``It was like a present,'' said Linder. But he cautioned that
more evidence, such as a seal or coins, was needed to conclusively
link the vessel to the Phoenicians.
   Since the dig began last year, divers have brought up small
pieces of the wreck, which is under about two yards of water. On
land, the pieces are treated with chemicals, and the parts will
eventually be reassembled, Rosloff said.
   ``Through model work and graphics, we will extrapolate the rest
of the boat,'' said Rosloff, a lecturer at Haifa University and
originally came from Kendall Park, N.J.
   The delicate excavation work is limited to just a few weeks a
year because of a heavy surf and strong currents that keep covering
the wreck with sand.
   Even if the vessel turns out not to be Phoenician, the wreck will
reveal many details about ancient seafarers, said Rosloff.
   The hull is the oldest and most complete to be discovered and may
reveal clues about ancient ship-building techniques.
   ``The wood that is left is in beautiful condition because the
sand covered it so quickly,'' Rosloff said.
   ``We don't know how ancient boats were built,'' added Linder.
``We will learn a lot from this.''

<HEAD>Study Says CDC Significantly Underestimates AIDS Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A system used by federal agencies significantly
underestimates the number of Americans with AIDS and distorts the
proportion of whites and minorities who have the disease, a
University of Chicago study concludes.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, a survey
conducted by the National Opinion Research Center at the University
of Chicago says estimates by the federal Centers for Disease Control
do not accurately reflect racial distribution of AIDS, nor the true
extent of the epidemic in the Midwest.
   Edward O. Laumann of the University of Chicago said the
distortion occurs because affluent whites can afford to be treated
discreetly by physicians who do not officially report the disease.
Also, he said, some data collection agencies are slow to compile
reports and misfile others.
   The CDC makes its estimate based on cases reported to official
agencies. An undercount or a failure to report cases could seriously
affect the CDC estimate, Laumann said in a telephone interview on
Thursday.
   ``We are contending that there is an undercount, but we don't
know the scale of it,'' said Laumann, who co-authored the report in
Science. ``We can estimate the demographic composition, but not the
gross numbers themselves. The reason we're being cautious is that
this is too small a sample.''
   To gather data for the study, Laumann and his associates
conducted interviews with members of 1,481 households around the
country. The households were selected to reflect a cross-section of
the population.
   Respondents were asked if they knew an acquaintance who had AIDS.
To validate the accuracy of the answers, the respondents also were
asked if they had an acquaintance who had been murdered.
   Using earlier studies on the number of people likely to have
known a murder victim, the researchers concluded that answers to the
homicide question were statistically accurate. This suggested that
answers to the AIDS question would be equally accurate.
   The results of the AIDS question ``suggest that the white
proportion (of AIDS cases) is substantially higher than CDC reports
and that a substantially greater share of the cases is in the
Midwestern region.''
   According to CDC figures from March 7, whites account for about
60 percent of the nation's AIDS cases. The University of Chicago
study put the number at 72 percent.
   The CDC said 26 percent of all victims so far are black and 14
percent are Hispanic. The Chicago results put these totals at 18
percent for blacks and 6 percent for Hispanics.
   Cases in the Midwest, according to the CDC, make up only 8
percent of the national total. The Chicago study said Midwest cases
actually comprise 20 percent of the national total.
   The comparative figures for other regions:
   _East: CDC, 39 percent of the national total; Chicago, 19 percent.
   _South: CDC, 26 percent; Chicago, 25 percent.
   _West: CDC, 27 percent; Chicago, 36 percent.
   Laumann said ``logic alone'' suggested something was wrong with
the CDC figures for the Midwest. Chicago, he said, ``has all of the
AIDS risk factors,'' such as a population of injection drug users,
and yet the city was said to have only 3.1 cases of AIDS per 10,000
residents, compared to a national total of 3.7 cases per 10,000.
   Also, he said, according to the CDC figures, ``Colorado at the
time of the 1988 survey had an absolute number of AIDS cases that
was equal to or even exceeded that of Michigan. And Colorado has 38
percent of the population of Michigan.'' Laumann said Michigan also
has big cities where the AIDS risk factors are common.
   ``That just doesn't make sense,'' he said.
   Laumann submitted the Chicago study to officials at the CDC for
comment, and he said ``these results don't surprise them.''
   ``They know that sexually transmitted diseases are generally
undercounted for the white population because people go to personal
physicians and one of the things they are doing is buying some
discretion about it,'' he said.
   He said cases were undercounted in the Midwest because of a
flawed system of data collection by official agencies.
   Gayle Lloyd, a spokewoman for the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta, said no officials were available to comment on the new
study. Attempts to reach CDC officials at an AIDS conference in
Montreal were not successful.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a fatal disease
caused by a virus that is spread most frequently by sexual
intercourse or by the sharing of needles among intravenous drug
users.
   Through April, the CDC reported that AIDS had been diagnosed in
94,280 Americans, of whom more than half, or 53,544, had died. No
one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   Science, which reported the Chicago study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   The Harvard Commission on the Presidential News
Conference studied the history of that institution last year. A
summary of its findings:
   THEODORE ROOSEVELT: He initiated the White House news conference
by inviting reporters to come in out of the rain. But T.R.'s
sessions were more lecture than give-and-take.
   WOODROW WILSON: The father of the real news conference, he felt
presidents should be obliged to answer reporters just as British
prime ministers must field questions in the House of Commons.
   WARREN HARDING: He insisted on written questions, submitted in
advance.
   CALVIN COOLIDGE: If he didn't like a written question, he'd
crumple it up and throw it away.
   HERBERT HOOVER: After the 1929 crash, he cut the frequency of
press conferences from two a week to one a week.
   FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: He met with reporters almost twice a week
for 13 years. He once directed a reporter to sit in a corner and
wear a dunce cap.
   HARRY S. TRUMAN: His spunky, spontaneous answers sometimes got
him in trouble.
   DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER: He allowed television cameras in. That
changed the nature of the news conference forever. But he did not
permit live telecasts.
   JOHN F. KENNEDY: He rehearsed answers and had a briefing book
prepared to help him. His sessions were marked by wit.
   LYNDON JOHNSON: He tended toward long opening statements to
reduce the amount of questioning on Vietnam.
   RICHARD NIXON: Once during Watergate he stalked off without
waiting for the usual closing, ``Thank you, Mr. President.''
   JIMMY CARTER: He cut the frequency after the Iran hostage crisis
started.
   RONALD REAGAN: He pledged to hold them once a month, but averaged
fewer than six a year.

   The Justice Department, already planning to
give $20,000 apiece to about 60,000 Japanese-Americans as reparation
for their World War II internment, wants to add their non-Japanese
family members to the list of recipients.
   The non-Japanese spouses or parents who went to internment camps
to be with their families were not included in the Civil Liberties
Act of 1988 that authorized the reparations, so the Justice
Department has begun work on new legislation that would allow
payments to them.
   There were approximately 80 such non-Japanese interned; the
department estimates 40 are still alive.
   ``In reality, these non-Japanese spouses and parents were
confronted by a horrifying choice,'' the department said Thursday in
its proposed regulations for distribution of money to the 60,000
Japanese-Americans.
   ``They could either `elect' to accompany their spouses or
children throughout the removal and internment process, or choose to
be separated from them,'' the regulations said.
   About 120,000 American citizens and permanent resident aliens of
Japanese ancestry were affected by the evacuations from the West
Coast. The department said only about 60,000 people are eligible for
the payments that will cost a total of about $1.25 billion. Congress
has not yet appropriated funds.
   The oldest survivors must be paid first.
   Under the law, payments go to those confined, held in custody,
relocated or ``otherwise deprived of liberty or property'' from Dec.
7, 1941, to June 30, 1946, because of U.S. actions based on their
Japanese ancestry.
   To be eligible, said Robert Bratt of the department's Office of
Redress Administration, ``you had to be living'' when then-President
Reagan signed the law, Aug. 10, 1988.
   ``But, people are dying at a rate of about 200 people per month.
If your parent died after Aug. 10, 1988, then you're eligible as a
survivor,'' said Bratt.
   The first recipient would be the surviving spouse, followed by
children and parents, if there are any, he said, adding that the
department is responsible for dividing the $20,000 equally among
several children.
   Each member of a family evacuated and interned will be
compensated, so a family of four still surviving would receive
$80,000, Bratt said.
   Compensation also will go to Japanese-American soldiers who lost
property or were unable to visit with their interned families,
according to the proposed regulations.
   Groups not entitled to compensation, the regulations say, include
those who evacuated voluntarily and those who relocated to Japan
during the war. In addition, minors who were U.S. citizens but who
moved to Japan with their parents during the war will not receive
payments.
   The proposed regulations, to be published in the Federal
Register, will be open for 30 days of public comment. The department
would not say when it expects final regulations to be issued.

<HEAD>Skinner: Bill Would Help Weed Out Drunken Mariners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
proposes to increase access to the National Driving Register to help
the Coast Guard weed out drunken mariners.
   Faced with ship's captains, pilots and other operators of
critical transportation vehicles who couldn't qualify for a motor
vehicle driver's license, Skinner sent a bill to Congress on
Thursday to ``screen out unfit mariners.''
   The measure would add to laws that already allow access to the
driving register in the aviation, rail, truck and bus industries.
   Skinner cited the history of drunken driving violations by the
Exxon Valdez captain who has been charged in the spill of 11 million
gallons of crude oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound.
   The captain, Joseph Hazelwood, tested positive for alcohol use
after the March 24 oil spill, and authorities found he had twice
been convicted of drunken driving in recent years and his New York
driver's license had been revoked three times. He had turned over
the helm of the ship to his third mate, who was not licensed to
negotiate the sound, when the vessel ran aground.
   Hazelwood is charged in Alaska with operating the vessel while
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of
pollution into the water, all misdemeanors.
   ``We cannot allow the safety of the traveling public or the
quality of our environment to be jeopardized by persons in
safety-critical jobs who are drug or alcohol abusers,'' Skinner said
in sending the legislation to Congress.
   The bill would allow the Coast Guard to examine the driving
records of men and women who are in the merchant marines or applying
for positions on merchant vessels.
   ``The proposed bill reflects a careful balancing of the privacy
rights of employees with the important public safety need to screen
out unfit merchant mariners,'' Skinner said.
   The national register has been kept since 1960 to help states
exchange information about drivers with poor records. It includes
information about drivers whose licenses have been revoked or
suspended for drunken driving or other traffic law violations.
   A 1982 law, which Skinner wants to expand, allows truck, bus and
other motor vehicle companies to request driving records of
individual employees or applicants but limits access to the previous
three years.
   Congress in 1987 and 1988 extended access to the register for
employees in the aviation and rail industries. The Federal Aviation
Administration has drawn up regulations that would permit it to
suspend or revoke pilot certificates based on records of driving
motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

   In a report June 5 on a Supreme Court decision
upholding a sculptor's rights to his work, The Associated Press
erroneously reported that the court ruled the sculpture in question
was a ``work made for hire'' under federal copyright law.
   The decision, written by Justice Thurgood Marshall, actually said
the sculpture, titled ``Third World America'' and commissioned by a
homeless group, was not a work made for hire. The ``not'' was
inadvertently dropped in the AP report.

<HEAD>Bush Links Improved US-Iran Relations to Hostages' Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says his administration wants to
improve relations with Iran but awaits help from Tehran in freeing
American hostages held in Lebanon.
   ``I stated the other day what it would take to have improved
relationships, and that would a renunciation of terror,'' Bush said
Thursday night at a news conference, repeating a statement he made
shortly after the death of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   The United States, he said, wants ``a change in relations.''
   ``We like the Iranian people,'' Bush said, but ``we can't have
normalized relations with a state that is branded a terrorist state.
   ``And secondly they must facilitate the release of American
hostages. That is what it would take.''
   The president noted that the speaker of the Iranian Parliament,
Hashemi Rafsanjani, has said Iran would use its influence to help
free nine American hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiite Lebanese if
the United States helped free Shiites taken by Christian militiamen
in Beirut. The Iranians made a similar proposal previously.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said earlier in the day
that he was not impressed by Rafsanjani's offer. He said the United
States provided information on the Iranian hostages to Iran in 1982.
   Bush said an improvement in relations ``is going to take a change
in behavior.''
   ``I don't see so far any sign of change,'' he said, adding that
he had ``held out the olive branch'' in his inaugural speech on Jan.
20.
   His message to Iranian leaders then, as now, was ``You want
better relations, do what's right. Do what's right by people who are
held against their will. We see no movement. I repeat that offer
tonight.''

   Here is a transcript of President Bush's news
conference Thursday night.
   Bush: Welcome to the East Room. Please be seated, and we shall
proceed.
   Helen?
   Q. Mr. President, cutting off military sales to China does not
seem to have made an impression on the rulers there, and they've
become more repressive. What else are you going to do to express
this nation's outrage? And do you have any other plans?
   A. Helen, I think that the position we took, aiming not at the
Chinese people but at the military arrangements, was well-received
around the world, and was followed by many countries right after we
did that.
   Many of the European countries followed suit.
   The events in China are such that we obviously deplore the
violence and the loss of life; urge restoration of order, with
recognition of the rights of the people.
   And I'm still hopeful that China will come together, respecting
the urge for democracy on the part of the people.
   And what we will do in the future, I will announce at appropriate
times.
   But right now we are engaged in diplomatic efforts, and other
countries are doing the same thing.
   And let's hope that it does have an ameliorating effect on the
situation.
   Q. Does your support of human rights and democracy extend to
other places in the world, like South Africa, the West Bank, where
they've been fighting a lot longer than in China _
   A. Yes, it does.
   Q. _ against repression?
   A. It certainly does.
   The concern is universal.
   And that's what I want the Chinese leaders to understand.
   You see, we've taken this action.
   I am one who lived in China.

<TEXT>
   I understand the importance of the relationship with the Chinese
people and with the government.
   It is in the interest of the United States to have good
relations, but because of what you _ the question that you properly
raised, we have to speak out in favor of human rights.
   And we aren't going to remake the world, but we should stand for
something.
   And there's no question in the minds of these students that the
United States is standing in their corners.
   I'll tell you a little anecdote.
   When our cars went out to the university to pick up some of the
students and bring them out, they were met by universal applause.
   And then the students in this country have been quite supportive
of the steps that I have taken.
   We had a few into the Oval Office the other day, and I must say
my heart goes out to them.
   They can't _ they cannot talk to their families.
   And it's very difficult.
   But, yes, the United States must stand wherever, in whatever
country, universally for human rights.
   And let me say _ you mentioned South Africa. Absolutely. Abhor _
you know, appalling apartheid must end.
   Yeah, Terry?
   Q. Mr. President, can the United States ever have normal
relations with China as long as the hard-liners believed responsible
for the massacre, such as Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng, remain
in power? In other words, what will it take to get U.S.-Chinese
relations back to normal?
   A. It will take a recognition of the rights of individuals and
respect for the rights of those who disagree.
   And you have cited two leaders, one of whom I might tell you is _
since you mentioned Deng Xiaoping, I'm not sure the American people
know this.
   He was thrown out in a _ by the cultural revolution crowd back in
the late '60s, came back in; 1976 was put out again because he was
seen as too forward-looking.
   And all I'm saying from that experience is, let's not jump to
conclusions as to how individual leaders in China feel when we
aren't sure of that.
   But the broad question that you asked, we can't have totally
normal relations unless there's a recognition that the _ of the
validity of the students' aspirations, and I think that that will
happen.
   We had a visit right here, upstairs, in the White House with Mr.
Wan Li.
   Now, I don't know whether he's in or out, but he said something
to me that I think the American people would be interested in.
   He said, ``The army loves the people.''

   And then you've seen soldiers from the 27th Army coming in from
outside of Beijing, and clearly shooting people.
   But, I don't think _ and having said that, I don't think we ought
to judge the whole People's Liberation Army of China by that
terrible incident.
   And so, let's _ what I want to do is preserve this relationship
as best I can, and I hope the conditions that lie ahead will permit
me to preserve this relationship.
   I don't want to pass judgment on individual leaders, but I want
to make very clear to those leaders and to the rest of the world
that the United States denounces the kind of brutality that all of
us have seen on our television.
   Right here. Brit?
   Q. Mr. President, I want to ask you about the now-infamous
memorandum that the Republican National Committee distributed
concerning Speaker Foley. First, do you think it's credible that
this memorandum, which you called ``disgusting,'' was not known
about by anybody above the level of the staffer who wrote it? And
second, do you think it's enough, sir, for this staffer to resign,
and for everyone then to simply say that the matter is closed?
   A. Well, in the first place, I have great respect for Tom Foley,
and he's the one that says the matter should be closed, and he's
right.
   And let me just repeat, it was disgusting.
   And I hope _ it's against everything that I have tried to stand
for in political life.
   But, I discussed that matter with Lee Atwater.
   He looked me right in the eye and said he did not know about it.
   He moved promptly to _ to remove the person that did know about
it.
   And so, I accept that.
   But I think that Speaker Foley, a most honorable man who
obviously was done a terrible ill-service to by this, is correct
when he says, ``Let's get it behind us.''
   And I'd like to shift the _ shift the gears, and move into ethics
legislation, all the time being sure we try to avoid this kind of
ugliness on either side.
   Just a follow-up question?
   Q. Just to follow up, Speaker Foley has indicated that he'd like
to change the atmosphere, which has been somewhat poisonous on
Capitol Hill this year. Some Democrats have said that you, as the
leader of your party here in town, should do something to try to get
the Republicans to join in that effort. What do you say to that
call, sir?
   A. I don't think the atmosphere is caused by one party or another.
   I expressed the same kind of outrage about _ that I've just
expressed about Speaker Foley, about John Tower.

   I think any fair-minded person, no matter how the situation
worked out _ but you know and I know that he was vilified by rumor
and innuendo.
   Vilified. And I don't like it there.
   And I didn't like this _ what happened to Mr. Foley, and yes,
Brit, I hope I can find a way to elevate it and keep it on the
issues, and this _ you know, I'm a realist, I've been around this
track for a long time, but we've got to do better.
   The ugliness of this climate is bad.
   And I don't like it, and I'd like to think that I could help.
   Maybe this, itself, will help.
   We'll work right across, here.
   Q. Yes, Mr. President, I'd like to return to China, for a moment.
You mentioned that your goal is to preserve our relationship with
the Chinese government, but what do you say to the American people
who might wonder why we are not more forceful in being the world's
leading advocate of democracy, and are we not living up to that
responsibility in this situation?
   A. Well, some have suggested, for example, to show our
forcefulness, that I bring the American ambassador back.
   I disagree with that 180 degrees.
   And we've seen, in the last few days, a very good reason to have
him there.
   In fact, one of your colleagues, Richard Roth of CBS, was
released partially because of the work of our embassy, of Jim
Lilley, our very able ambassador.
   Some have suggested: Well, you've got to go full sanctions on
economic side.
   I don't want to cut off grain, and we've just sold grain to the
People's Republic of China.
   I think that would be counterproductive and would hurt the people.
   What I do want to do is take whatever steps are most likely to
demonstrate the concern that America feels, and I think I've done
that, and I'll be looking for other ways to do it, if we possibly
can.
   Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi has taken refuge
in the U.S. Embassy, apparently fearing for his own safety. The
Chinese government has called that a wanton interference in internal
affairs and a violation of international law. What is your reaction
to that, and will the United States grant Fang political asylum in
the United States?
   A. First, let me remind the audience here that we do not discuss
asylum.
   It's almost like a public discussion of intelligence matters.
   But in terms of your question, we have acted in compliance with
the international law as an extraordinary measure for humanitarian
reasons.
   His personal safety was involved here, he felt.
   Andthen we try, historically, to work these things out in
consultation with the sovereign state.
   So, we are not violating international law in the opinion of our
attorneys, and it's awful hard, it is awful hard for the United
States when a man presents himself, a person who is a dissident, and
says that his life is threatened, to turn _ turn him back.
   And that isn't one of the premises upon which the United States
was founded.
   So, we have a difference with them on that; you're right.

   But I hope it can be resolved.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, this week the Supreme Court reversed an 18-year
standard for fair employment decisions. Now, under the old standard,
employers had to justify as legitimate practices that excluded women
and minorities. The court's decision now puts the burden of proof on
plaintiffs to show that the practices they're challenging are not
legitimate. Civil rights advocates say that the decision makes it
much more difficult for women and minorities to challenge practices
that exclude them. Do you support efforts to restore the old
standard?
   A. I have not yet received the memo from the general counsel on
this decision, and thus I really have to defer.
   I wish I could tell you.
   But I am one who, when a civil _ when the Supreme Court makes a
ruling, figures that the president of the United States must adhere
by the law as determined.
   But we're getting that analyzed.
   And then, sometimes you can take remedy in suggested legislation.
   Right there in the middle.
   Q. Mr. President, the Iranian government, of course, has changed.
And the question to you is, is there hope that there might be
restored some kind of relations with that country? As you know,
today the Iranians set forth informally an offer for some kind of a
deal that if the Americans would help free some Iranians held by the
Phalangists that they might help us free some of our prisoners as
well _ or our hostages. Is there any hope for any change in the near
future?
   A. For a change in relationship?
   I stated the other day what it would take to have improved
relationships, and that would be a renunciation of terror.
   We do not need _ we can't have normalized relations with a state
that's branded a terrorist state.
   And secondly, they must facilitate the release of American
hostages.
   And so that was _ is what it would take.
   And there was a case a while back on _ where Iran asked for
information regarding their hostages; never accused us, properly so,
of holding people hostage or in any way condoning that.
   We condemn it.
   And so _ and we've supplied them information.
   But it's going to take a change in behavior.
   We don't mind name-calling.
   They keep calling us ``The Great Satan'' _ that doesn't bother us.
   ``Sticks and stones'' _ remember the old adage _ ``will hurt your
bones'' _ and names don't hurt you.
   But performance is what we're looking for.
   And I don't see so far any sign of change.
   I held out the olive branch at the _ my speech, inauguration
speech, and I said, ``Look, we want better relations with Iran.''
   I remember when we had good relations.
   We like the Iranian people.
   We have a lot of Iranians living in this country.
   But we can't _ and I said, ``Look, you want better relations, do
what's right _ do what's right by people that are held against their
will.''
   And we see no movement.
   I would repeat that offer tonight.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, the other day you picked up the phone and
talked to Richard Nixon about China. I'm wondering, since you know
some of the Chinese leaders personally, why you don't pick up the
phone and talk to them?
   A. I tried today.
   Isn't that a coincidence that you'd ask that question? (Laughter.)
   Q. And what did you learn?
   A. The line was busy. (Laughter.)
   I couldn't get through.
   They're out _
   Q. Mr. President _
   A. Oh yeah, you get a follow-up. Go ahead.
   Q. Well, I'm wondering if you learned anything from those phone
calls about who's really running China.
   A. No, because I couldn't get through.
   And I talked to our ambassador, knowing that we'd get some _
understandably get questions on China tonight _ and the situation is
still very, very murky.
   And that's the way it's been.
   I remember, Johanna _ I remember being in China when the way we'd
tell who was winning and who was losing, who was up and who was
down, we'd send people out around town to count the red-flagged
limousines.
   And then they'd say, ``Oh, there's 30 of them gathered here;
there must be an important meeting.''
   And everybody'd hover around trying to see who emerged or who
stood next to somebody on a parade on festival day.
   And it's opened up much more than that.
   There have been dramatic changes since then.

   But in terms of our trying to figure out their internal order, it
is extraordinarily difficult.
   And I did try to contact a Chinese leader today, and it didn't
work.
   But I'm going to keep on trying.
   I want them to know that I view this relationship as important,
and yet I view the life of every single student as important.
   David.
   Q. Mr. President, during the 1988 campaign, the Republicans ran
ads featuring Chuck Yeager, saying that thousands of defense jobs
would be lost with the election of Michael Dukakis; yet, your
defense budget would cut several thousand jobs in your home state of
Texas, including the elimination of the V-22 Osprey. Is there an
inconsistency or conflict with your campaign _
   A. None whatsoever. None whatsoever.
   Do you want to follow up? (Laughter).
   Q. Yes, sir _
   A. Go ahead.
   Q. Is there any _ is there any hope for revitalizing those
programs that are going to be cut?
   A. Well, not programs that the secretary of defense, in
consultation with the White House, had felt were less than priority.
   And, you know, when you go to assign priorities it isn't easy.
   And we had a program on to facilitate a way to close bases, and
lo and behold, everybody in whose district there was no base thought
it was a wonderful idea.
   And everybody in whose district there was a base, or whose state,
felt, ``Well, we ought to fine tune this one. They don't seem to
understand.''
   It is hard to do this, Dave.
   And I know there's some people who are thrown out of work.
   But our defense budget is, in my view, ample for the national
security needs of this country.
   But the defense secretary has had to make certain tough calls on
systems, and yes, some people have been thrown out of work.
   But if this economy keeps moving, I expect they'll find work
because we do have a strong level of defense spending.
   Charle?
   And then we'll _ these three across here.
   Q. Earlier, sir, you made reference to Deng Xiaoping, suggesting
that he may, if I read you right, not necessarily have been
responsible for the actions. You said that he was a reformer, twice
out, back in. What were you trying to say? Do you have information
that _
   A. I was trying to say that I don't know.
   And I'm trying to say you don't know, and he doesn't know, and
she doesn't know, and nobody knows outside; and that's the way the
Chinese system works.
   So for us to read every day some new name out there, it just
isn't right.
   And I don't want to misrepresent this to the American people.
   But what I do know is that there's events over there, that it
doesn't matter who's in charge, we condemn.
   And there's a relationship over there that is fundamentally
important to the United States that I want to see preserved.
   And so, I'm trying to find a proper, prudent balance, not
listening to the extremes that say, ``Take your ambassador out; cut
off all food to the Chinese people so you show that you're
concerned.''
   And I think we've found a proper avenue there, but I cannot _ and
you ask a good question _ I simply cannot tell you with authority
who is calling the shots there today.

   Q. Let me follow by asking you this then: When you were in China
earlier in the year, you met with Li Peng, and I believe you told
him that China was exempted from your policy review because you knew
China, you understood China. Have you been let down personally? Have
you been misled in any way?
   A. I feel a certain sense of personal disappointment, but they
weren't exempt from the norms of behavior that are accepted
internationally in terms of armed people don't shoot down unarmed
students.
   Nobody suggested that.
   There was an interesting point in there, and I don't want to
delve into the detail of private conversations, but one of the
Chinese leaders, a very prominent name, told me: ``We want change,
but people have to understand it's very complicated here, how fast
we move on these reforms. We've come a long way.''
   And indeed they did move dramatically faster on economic reforms
than I think any of us in this room would have thought possible.
   What hasn't caught up is the political reforms and reforms in
terms of freedom of expression.
   The freedom of press caught up a little bit, but it hadn't gone,
obviously, near far enough, and now there's martial law and
censorship.
   But we were cautioned on that visit about how fast China could
move.
   Some of it was economic, and clearly some of the message had to
do with how fast they could move politically.
   Yeah?
   Q. Mr. President, turning your attention to a matter that's
devastating here at home and all over the world, the question of
AIDS, respected experts are now starting to suggest that, instead of
the anonymous testing that has existed in the past, there should be
mandatory reporting of new cases by name and vigorous follow-ups on
sexual partners and needle-sharing partners. Do you favor such an
approach, sir?
   A. I have spoken at an international AIDS conference at which I
was roundly booed two years ago or so advocating certain kinds of
testing.
   And I don't want to have _ you said mandatory for everybody?
   Q. Yeah. Or at least _ an end to the anonymity of it.
   A. No. I don't favor that.
   I think there is a certain right to privacy that we should
respect.
   So in terms of anonymity, I would like to suggest that records of
that nature should be kept private.
   There's a lot of suffering for AIDS victims.
   There's a lot of human tragedy that we haven't really focused on
too much, and I think of something less than very discreet handling
of that information would not be helpful.
   But do I encourage people to come forward and talk to their
doctors and all about partners that may affect others?
   Yes.
   I do think you do need that kind of frankness and I do favor
certain kinds of testing.
   Lesley.
   Q. Mr. President, back to China. There are reports tonight that
the government there has begun rounding up the student leaders, who
face, at the very least, persecution; at the most, possibly charges
of treason and whatever punishment that will bring. You have talked
tonight about your strong desire to keep this relationship going,
and to keep the dialogue and all our business as usual, but moving
forward. If the _
   A. Not at all. Excuse the interruption.
   Q. Well, except for the military. If we find out that the people
who perpetrated the killings in Tiananmen Square and who are
rounding up these students are running the government, can the
United States maintain fairly normal relationships with them, given
our aim to foster human rights and promote democracy?
   A. It would make it extraordinarily difficult, but the question
is so hypothetical that I'm going to avoid answering it directly.
   But anything that codifies the acceptance of brutality or lack of
respect for human rights will make things much more difficult.
   There's no question about that.
   Q. One follow-up. There are 20,000 Chinese students in the United
States.
   A. Yes.
   Q. Many of them have spoken out. Are you prepared to grant them
political asylum in this country?
   A. They're not seeking asylum.
   I'll tell you what _ I'll tell you why I answer the question that
way.
   They're not seeking asylum.
   We had four of them in the other day, and the first thing that
one of them, Jao Wa said, ``I love my country,'' and he wants to go
back to his country.
   But what I have done is extend the visas, so that people are not
compelled to go back to our country.
   He's not seeking asylum.
   This man is not going to turn his back on his own country.
   He wants to change things, but he also wants to know that he's
going to be safe, and I don't blame him for that.
   So it's not a question of all these people _ asylum is kind of a
_ is a legal status, and that's not what they're looking for.
   Q. In light of the student roundups _ I mean, if they face _
   A. It's appalling, and so I would simply say that what we've
already done would say to these people, ``You don't have to go
back,'' but I'm not going to ask them to turn down the flag that
they love and turn their back on China.
   These are patriotic young people who fear, because of seeing
their own brothers and sisters gunned down.

WASHN: gunned down.    But they're not seeking asylum; they don't
want to flee China, they want to help change China.    Yeah, these two
in here. Yes, sir?    Q. Mr. President, if we can discuss another communist
giant for a while. Your attitude towards the Soviet Union seems to have
shifted a bit since you became president from deep skepticism to seeming
acceptance of their intentions. Do you now accept Mr. Gorbachev's sincerity
in regard to his pledge of ``new thinking''? And can you tell us a little
bit about why you changed ...    A. I don't think it's shifted as much
as you think, Michael. I don't think it's shifted as much. What I did was
to say we need time to make some prudent discovery _ investigation and
discovery _ and then to go forward with a proposal. And I've, we've done
exactly that.    The proposal we made at NATO was _ has _ has unified
the alliance. And some of the leaders told me that it's more unified than
it's been in history.    We've made a good proposal now, and I hope the
Soviets will take it on good faith, and I am encouraged by the response
so far.    Having said that, in dealing with the Soviet Union, I am going
to continue to keep my eyes wide up _ wide open. I will also say, I want
to see perestroika succeed, I want to see it succeed not fail. And I told
Mr. Gorbachev that one-on-one last fall at Governor's Island.    So I
don't think he believes that I view this as some kind of a Cold War relationship,
or that I want to see perestroika fail.    He did say that he felt there
were some elements in this country that did, but I don't think _ I hope
that now he knows that I don't look at it that way.    Q. If I could just
follow up?    A. Yeah.    Q. Do you accept that he is sincere in terms
of, are you operating on the assumption that he is sincere when he says
he's interested in ``new thinking'' in international affairs?    A. He's
already demonstrated that he's interesting, interested in new thinking.
Who would have thought that we would sit here and on television see a
relatively lively debate. It's nothing like our Congress, but _ and so
it had some similar, similar aspects to it.    And so I think he has already
demonstrated his commitment to change and to reform. But there's ways now
to solidify these changes. They have 600,000 troops and we have 305,000.
And I made an offer to him.    I said the best way to guarantee stability
and a less war-like attitude is to go to equal numbers, and they are being
asked to take out many, many more troops than we are.    But I've said,
``What's wrong with being equal? The United States will have 275,000 troops
deployed, and you, sir, will have 275,000.'' So here's a test now.   
Nobody can argue the inequity of that, particularly since we've put aircraft
and helicopters and these other categories on the table. So, and I am inclined
to think that if I do my work properly and we keep NATO moving forward
on this quick timetable, that we can succeed.    And if we do, he will
once again have demonstrated his desire to _ for change.    Yes, Sir?
   Q. Mr. President, first, at the great risk of appearing to be trying
to make points, please convey birthday wishes to Mrs. Bush.

birthday, but she's doing very well. And thank you.
   And if I could editorialize here one minute _ there have been a
lot of expressions unrelated to her birthday about her health. And

   Q. Mr. President, some of your critics say that despite your
rhetoric, General Noriega can sit in Panama for as long as he
wishes, in effect laughing at you, sir, laughing at the United
States.
   Can you do anything about it? Should you?
   A. You know, as you look around the world and you see change,
respect for the election process, Panama _ I would simply say Panama
is not immune. And what _ we're all traumatized improperly by some
of the terrible excesses, by the terrible excesses in Tiananmen
Square.
   But I haven't forgotten the brutal beating of Guillermo Ford in
Panama, and the world hasn't forgotten it. And a _ European public
opinion has changed dramatically as they look at, as they look at
Mr. Noriega now.
   And I _ it is my fervent hope that the OAS will stay with -- the
Organization of American States will stay with their mission and
will keep working on their mandate until Mr. Noriega leaves.
   And let me repeat an important point here. I think there is some
feeling in Panama that we are against the PDF, the Panama Defense
Forces. We have no argument with the PDF. Many of their people have
trained in the United States.
   We respect the Panamanian people. And so the problem is Noriega,
and if he gets out, and they recognize the results of a freely held
election _ and certifiably freely held, I will say, they would have
instant improved relations with the United States.
   So I am not going to give up on this. I think we are proper to
use the, use multilateral diplomacy in this instance, as well as
doing what we can bilaterally. And I intend to protect our treaty
rights, for example, and certainly do the best I can to guarantee
the safety of Americans.
   Trude?
   Q. Turning to NATO ...
   A. Can't hear you, Trude.
   Q. The agreement between Bonn and Washington on the nuclear issue
only temporarily bridges the differences. At what point do you
visualize the last missile going into Germany? Can any German
government expect it?
   A. Well, that matter has been properly deferred under the
agreement at NATO. Research can go forward, but the deployment
matter has been properly deferred. And let us just go forward on the
NATO arrangements that were announced in Brussels.
   And yes, there are differences. You're absolutely right. There
are differences in Germany on this whole question, and not just of
the Lance follow-on, but of the whole difference there on the
question of SNF, short-range nuclear forces.
   And it is our, it is in our interest to quickly move forward,
because if we can get implemented within our timeframe, the
agreement on conventional forces, that will take a tremendous amount
of pressure off the Germans on short-range forces.
   Q: Thank you.
   A. Time flies when you're having fun.
   Q: Can I just follow that up on ...
   A. All right, this is a follow-up, and then, if it's 30 minutes
...
   Q. There's no question about Poland! I'm a Polish reporter. Maybe
you will answer a question about what do, what are you expecting
from your visit to Poland?
   A. She's got a follow-up. You've misunderstood. She's got a
follow-up question.
   Q: ... With regard to ... because of your initiative there, but
isn't this _ isn't the West German challenge just the first of many,
now that the Soviet threat is diminishing in Western Europe?
   A. Well, but, let me use this question to reply to a question
about Poland, too. There will be new challenges for NATO, as the
level of concern about armed conflict reduces.
   I will keep reminding our friends, and they will keep reminding
me that we must keep whatever force is required to deter war. But
part of what's happening _ and I am glad the gentleman raised Poland
_ is this quest for democracy in Poland.
   And it will _ if that goes forward, I can see a much better
relationship for the United States with Poland in one that will, in
Poland itself, convince the people that they have less of a stake in
military confrontation or in a bloc, East Bloc confrontation with
the West.
   So, it is fascinating the change that is going on there. It is
absolutely fascinating, and we should be positioned. And I'm going
there to tell this to the leaders: ``We want to work with you.
You've got to reform your economy; we don't feel that you have any
bad intentions toward the United States; but we want to see this
policy of differentiation continue.''
   When a country moves like Poland did down democracy's path, the
United States should respond as best it could.
   Helen, thank you very much.

   Steven Spielberg's production company has
pledged a conditional $100,000 to help the financially ailing Los
Angeles Theatre Center.
   The grant from Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment Co. is unusual in
that 95 percent of the theater's donations last year came from
lawyers, doctors and accountants, according to screenwriter Frank
Pierson, a member of the theater's board of directors.
   Amblin Entertainment will donate the money if six other Hollywood
companies match the offer, Pierson said. The grants will go into a
new endowment fund.
   Amblin's gift was initiated when Pierson chatted with Harrison
Ford, star of Spielberg's ``Indiana Jones'' movies, at a recent
dinner party.
   ``We were talking about the plight of non-profit theater across
the country,'' said Pierson, who wrote the screenplay for Ford's
next movie, ``Presumed Innocent.'' Ford approached Spielberg and
Amblin offered the $100,000.
   The Los Angeles Theatre Center, opened in 1985, has a deficit of
$1.04 million.

   Ryan White has a pretty good idea who
anonymously gave him a shiny new red Mustang this week _ pop star
Michael Jackson.
   White, a 17-year-old AIDS victim, picked up his new car on
Wednesday and was told it was a gift from a mysterious benefactor.
But the evidence points to Jackson.
   ``When you deal with Michael, there are four or five people you
have to go through before you get to Michael,'' said White's mother,
Jeanne. ``It was hard not to know when they called and asked, `Now
what was the car that Ryan told Michael he liked?'''
   White drew national attention several years ago when school
officials tried to keep him out of junior high because he has AIDS,
contracted from tainted blood he received in a treatment for
hemophilia. The family later moved from Kokomo to Cicero, and he now
is a junior in Hamilton Heights High School.
   ``Michael has called Ryan some 15 times since their friendship
began, and they talk for about 45 minutes,'' Mrs. White said. ``Most
of the time they talk about cars, something Ryan is very interested
in.''
   She said Ryan wants to take his car to an upcoming car show.
   ``He wants to customize it, which I think is a good idea; it will
keep him busy,'' Mrs. White said.

as music director has been extended indefinitely.
   Under the terms of the new agreement, which the Philadelphia
Orchestra Association announced Tuesday, Muti's contract initially
will be extended through the 1991-92 season. It will be renewed
automatically each year by mutual agreement.
   Muti will continue to conduct at least one third of the

   Screenwriter Tom Schulman, who wrote the
script for the ``Dead Poets Society'' starring Robin Williams, says
the motion picture is not drawn from his own experiences as a
private school student.
   Schulman attended Nashville's Montgomery Bell Academy and then
Vanderbilt University here.
   The movie, which opens today across the country, is about a
fictitious boys' prep school in Vermont, called Welton Academy. The
harmony of the strait-laced, conformist school is disturbed when
Williams arrives to teach English.
   ``Since I did go to a `good' private prep school, I guess it
would be natural to assume that much of the story is based on my

   A Chinese student studying in the United States
said Thursday his pregnant wife and their American-born baby were
taken into custody at a Beijing airport while trying to leave the
country.
   Sanyuan Li, 32, said passengers who saw plainclothes officers
take Yu Cheng and 1-year-old Payton Li notified the woman's
relatives in Beijing after the arrest Monday.
   ``We don't know who is holding my wife and baby, so in this sense
it is kidnapping rather than arrest or custody,'' said Li, 32, a
doctoral candidate in political science at the University of Chicago.
   In Washington, a State Department official said the special China
task force has contacted the U.S. Embassy in Beijing about Mrs.
Cheng, 30, and the child.
   ``They are trying to find out what they can,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There are many such
requests.''
   Mrs. Cheng, a doctoral candidate in education at the University
of Chicago, returned to China May 19 to join the student protests
for democracy.
   ``She wanted to go back to show our solidarity with the students
and our support to them in their cause for democracy,'' Li said.
   He said she brought between $1,000 and $2,000 raised by
Taiwanese-Americans to help the student protesters.
   Mrs. Cheng's family ``want me to be low-key because if I enrage
authorities, they can do anything they want and they won't take
responsibility of the bad things they might do,'' Li said.
   His wife is four months pregnant, he said.

   Opposition leader Ricardo Arias
Calderon was arrested and held for two hours of questioning Thursday
night after returning to Panama on a commercial flight from the
United States, Arias said.
   Arias told reporters that members of the Panamanian Defense
Forces also seized some of his documents during his interrogation at
the Torrijos International Airport.
   The Defense Forces had no comment on the arrest.
   Arias said he was arrested at about 9 p.m. after arriving on a
commercial flight from Miami. Arias was the opposition's first
vice-presidential candidate in the May 7 elections that were
annulled by the government, controlled by Defense Forces chief
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Arias, his running mates and international observers claim that
the opposition won the election. The opposition claims the
government nullified the vote to prevent the opposition from taking
power.
   He, presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and second
vice-presidential candidate Guillermo Ford were beaten by
paramilitary Noriega supporters during a demonstration on May 10.
   During his visit to the United States, he criticized Gen.
Noriega's rule during a gathering of the Organization of American
States in Washington. The opposition supports the ouster of Noriega.
   During the meeting Arias also criticized the OAS's decision on
Wednesday to give six more weeks to a OAS mediation group to come up
with a plan for the democratic transfer of power in Panama.
   Arias did not tell journalists what he was asked during the
interrogation. Arias was questioned by Panamanian immigration
officials, who belong to the Defense Forces, then later was
interrogated by military officials.
   The U.S. government first imposed economic sanctions against
Noriega in 1988 after his indictment on U.S. charges of drug
trafficking.
   Noriega denies the charges and says they are part of a U.S.
government plot to renege on treaties that will transfer power of
the Panama Canal from the United States to Panama and require the
U.S. government to abandon its military bases around the canal by
the year 2000.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of Veterans Affairs Edward Derwinski
says he is hoping for early resolution of a House-Senate conflict
that has bogged down a bill containing $1.2 billion for veterans'
programs.
   Speaking to reporters Thursday, Derwinski said that ``with a
little luck,'' the measure should emerge from a conference committee
of the two houses and be sent to President Bush about June 23 or 24.
   The measure, which had passed the House earlier, was approved by
a voice vote in the Senate Wednesday night.
   Before it passed, however, it had been amended to provide for
such things as repairing a radio telescope in West Virginia,
ordering the Army to buy cold-weather clothing made in 10 specified
states, and studying last year's fires in Yellowstone National Park.
   Because of delay in passage of the bill, the Department of
Veterans Affairs issued orders May 26 ordering a freeze on hiring of
non-medical personnel, a halt in purchases of new equipment and
curtailment of treatment for claimants with a specified amount of
income who have non-service related disabilities.
   ``We are going to keep that in effect just as directed,''
Derwinski said.
   ``Every House and Senate member expresses total devotion to the
VA, but in the meantime they keep loading up the bill with
amendments which are either unacceptable to the other body or
unacceptable to the White House,'' he said.
   The secretary, who served 24 years as a Republican congressman
from Illinois, said, ``I know that's the Congress, and I served
there long enough to know how it's done, but it's a little
frustrating when you're the hostage.''
   The $1.2 billion for veterans' programs is part of $3.3 billion
in the bill, which would supply several agencies for the remaining
four months of the 1989 fiscal year.
   Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, the ranking Republican on the
House Appropriations Committee, said at a news conference Wednesday
that it might be late July before the differences are resolved.

<HEAD>Hong Kong Group Worries About Reunification With China</HEAD>

   Hong Kong Chinese students and profesionals are
concerned not only at the fate of friends and relatives in
strife-torn Beijing but also at the implications of the crisis for
the reunification of Hong Kong and China.
   ``... Hong Kong residents have accepted that re-unification with
China by 1997 is inevitable,'' said the Federation of Overseas Hong
Kong Chinese, a group of more than 2,000 students and professionals
linked across the world by computer.
   ``However, this gradually built-up sense of belonging to the
People's Republic of China is seriously being threatened by the
Beijing Massacre.''
   The federation called Thursday for a ``peaceful general strike''
of all workers across China and demanded that the British government
take immediate action to ``fulfill obligations to protect all Hong
Kong residents in China.''
   Hong Kong is a British Crown Colony. London and Beijing signed a
joint declaration in 1984 calling for transfer of control of Hong
Kong to China in 1997.
   Wing-Wah Chan, federation coordinator, said that ``scores'' of
Hong Kong residents in China holding Hong Kong-British passports
have been denied protection by the British Embassy. The situation
has become worse since the weekend massacre in Tiananmen Square, he
said.
   ``The people of Hong Kong, of course, heard the message of
Tiananmen Square louder than anyone else in the world,'' said Rep.
John Porter, R-Ill., who is co-chairman of the Congressional Human
Rights Caucus.
   With only eight years before Hong Kong comes under the People's
Republic of China's control, Porter said, ``Great Britain, it seems
to us in the Congressional Human Rights Caucus, has not been
forceful enough in protecting the basic human rights of the people
of Hong Kong.''
   Porter said he will introduce legislation next week to expand the
number of Hong Kong immigrants allowed in the United States from
5,000 to as many as 50,000. He added that 45,000 Hong Kong citizens
left Beijing last year, mainly for Canada, Australia, Taiwan and
America.
   Chi-Kwan Ho, a doctorate student at the University of Maryland
who is associate coordinator of the federation, said, ``We are
psychologically preparing for more crackdown and arrests.
   ``What the people can do now is ... be calm and think of strategy
... of how they can sustain this (pro-democracy) protest but not in
a way that would endanger their lives immediately.''

   President Bush wants Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to show ``his desire for change'' by quickly accepting
U.S. proposals to cut conventional forces in Europe.
   Bush told a White House news conference Thursday night that
Gorbachev ``has already demonstrated his commitment to change and to
reform ... I want to see perestroika succeed ... not fail.''
   ``But there's ways now to solidify these changes,'' said the
president, urging Gorbachev to accept the U.S. offer to cut its
305,000 troops in Central Europe to 275,000 if the Soviets cut their
600,000-man force to the lower U.S.level.
   ``What is wrong with being equal?'' said Bush. ``So here's a test
now.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the administration
wants Gorbachev to respond to the U.S. proposal when he visits West
Germany next week.
   Bush also extended a hand of friendship and congratulations to
the people Poland who, in their first democratic elections since
World War II, gave a resounding vote of no confidence in the
Communist government.
   The president said that when he travels to Poland next month, he
will tell its leaders, ``We want to work with you.''
   ``The quest for democracy in Poland ... if it goes forward, will
mean a much better relationship for Poland'' with the United States,
he said.
   The president acknowledged that some disagreements remained
between the United States and West Germany over whether to modernize
Lance short-range nuclear missiles, but he said a conventional force
agreement could solve that problem.
   ``It is in our interests to quickly move forward, because if we
can get implemented within our timeframe the agreement on
conventional forces, that will take a tremendous amount of pressure
off the Germans on short-range forces,'' Bush said.
   Baker said that Soviet acceptance of the U.S. proposal to reduce
NATO and Warsaw Pact forces to the same level ``would substantially
reduce the threat of surprise military attack and the danger of
large-scale offensive operations against Western Europe.''
   ``The time is ripe for Mr. Gorbachev to respond positively to the
opportunities presented by NATO's initiatives,'' said Baker.
   The secretary of state said the U.S. proposals offer the Soviets
the opportunity both to channel resources from the military to the
civilian sector and to accelerate the process of political reform in
Eastern Europe.

   It began with the slap of jogging feet on
pavement. It was early Saturday, June 3, and thousands of young,
unarmed soldiers moved into the city.
   An impenetrable wall of citizens stopped them as they marched
from the east and north toward Tiananmen Square, where students were
holding a huge sit-in for freedom and clean government.
   ``Please go back. We don't need you here,'' a high school teacher
said.
   The soldiers, some beginning to cry, broke ranks and retreated in
small, ragtag groups. Citizens escorted them out of Beijing, feeling
they had scored an important victory over rulers who had declared
martial law but had been hesitant to apply it.
   On the other side of the capital, thousands more residents
savored another apparent victory. Two buses of soldiers and weapons
were captured in the first military foray toward Tiananmen.
   Students entered the supply bus and triumphantly waved assault
rifles out the windows. Others made impassioned speeches against the
government to a wildly approving crowd.
   ``We are peaceful students who love our country,'' said a young
man with a white headband. ``Why must the people's army threaten the
people with guns?''
   Jubilation reigned, however briefly.
   Within hours, hundreds would lie dead on the streets of Beijing,
people of China killed by the People's Liberation Army. A movement
for a freer nation would be in shambles.

<NOTE>Saturday, June 3</NOTE>

   2:00 p.m. _ An army broadcast warns students to return the
weapons from the supply bus captured at the Liubu intersection,
about a mile west of the 100-acre Tiananmen Square. They ignore the
warning.
   2:10 p.m. _ Riot police burst out from Zhongnanhai, headquarters
of the Communist Party. Tear gas is used in Beijing for the first
time in Communist China's 40-year history.
   Security forces beat dozens of people mercilessly at the Liubu
intersection. A woman falls down and policemen kick her. They grab
her hair and beat her face with truncheons.
   The weapons are recovered.
   Demonstrators, their faces and chests bloodied, walk away in
shock. A man with wounds to his head and back staggers down an
alleyway. ``My God! my God!'' he spits through shattered teeth.
   After seven weeks of peaceful protest, the government had lost
its patience.
   A mile away, also at 2:10 p.m., about 5,000 unarmed soldiers
marched out of the Great Hall of the People but were blocked from
Tiananmen by throngs of students and a city bus. It was the closest
soldiers had been to the square since martial law was declared May
20.
   ``If you want to shoot, shoot me!'' screamed a 73-year-old woman
in pajamas. ``Just don't shoot the students.''
   The mood moved like the sea of people. At one stage, the soldiers
sang military songs and the students applauded.
   But the hot day wore on and tempers flared. A few soldiers lashed
out with their belts. Rocks, tree branches and beer bottles flew
between the two sides, and several people were bloodied.
   Fighting abated and the standoff continued until 8 p.m., when the
soldiers returned to the Great Hall. Students shook their hands and
patted them on the back.
   Half an hour later, thousands of people gathered on the bridge at
Muxudi, the western gateway to the inner city. Crowds moved buses to
block passage to the bridge by massing troops.
   The first wave of troops from the 27th Army charged toward the
bridge at 10 p.m., firing tear gas and swinging clubs.
   Burning rugs from a nearby apartment were thrown onto the bus
barricades. A gas tank exploded, then another. The sky flickered
orange and black. Bullets whistled and richocheted. Tear gas
canisters boomed.
   ``Fascists! Fascists!'' the crowd chanted.
   It was 11 o'clock. The soldiers opened fire, aiming low.
   ``Live fire! Live fire!'' a student shouted, moments after a
bullet hit his leg.
   Blood pooled on the pavement, spattered the bridge at Muxudi.
   Gasoline bombs flew from the crowd at a tank. People surged
around the tank, pulled two crewmen out and beat them senseless.
   The civilians set the tank ablaze, with red flags reading
``Democracy'' and ``Freedom'' flapping from its turrets.
   Midnight comes, and with it the first breakthrough. Armored
personnel carriers smash through the blockade and head east toward
the square.
   ``Clear the street! Clear the way!'' a medic yells.
   Bloodied residents, sprawled on three-wheeled pedicabs and
howling with pain, are pushed up side streets. Ill-equipped doctors
pound on chests and apply makeshift bandages. Their lips are red
with blood from mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   ``He's gone; we've lost him!'' a medic yells as a man with a
bullet hole in his chest gurgles and shakes.
   ``This is China! This is my country!'' a man screams, pointing
down the street where soldiers crouch and fire from the shadows.
   A line of 50 troop trucks plows through the crumpled roadblock.
Soldiers fire into the air. A cleaning woman on the 14th floor is
killed by gunfire and another woman is hit as she looks out from an
eighth floor balcony.
   An armored personnel carrier careens along the north side of
Tiananmen Square and is greeted by gasoline bombs.
   A second armored vehicle turns up the west side of the Great Hall
of the People and the crowd stops it by hurling chunks of concrete.
People pound the armor with sticks and pelt it with rocks.

   12:30 a.m. _ More soldiers approach early Sunday from the south,
firing as they come. Thousands of people mass at the Tianqiao
intersection, blocking it with carts, cars and furniture. Automatic
weapons fire crackles in the darkness.
   An 8-year-old boy is killed as he sleeps in his parent's
restaurant on the corner and his parents, sobbing with sorrow and
anger, hang his bloody blanket outside.
   1 a.m. _ Four buses blaze at the Xidan intersection as a throng
of thousands prepares for troops from the west.
   ``Make them pay for this invasion!'' a student yells. ``Defend
the capital against these running dogs!''

   Some armored cars break through the roadblock.
   Soldiers and civilians battle to the east and west of the
intersection. A command jeep is attacked and overturned.
   An officer emerges from the jeep and fires into the crowd,
killing four people. Others seize him, beat him to death, strip and
disembowel him, then burn his body and hang it on a blazing bus.
   Troops take up position on the southwest corner of the square.
Angry crowds surround them.
   A column of several thousand soldiers enters from the southeast,
jogging to positions along the eastern side next to the history
museum. Students spot the approaching soldiers and race forward to
do battle with sticks and bars.
   After brief skirmishes, the soldiers fall back across the street.
   Most of the several thousand remaining students huddle near the
Monument of Revolutionary Martyrs, but some move to the northern
square to confront other troops. Soldiers open fire and many
students are hit in the back as they flee.
   ``We've treated hundreds so far tonight,'' said a medical student
working in a tent on the square. ``This boy was hit twice.''
   A youth with a white headband reading ``Freedom'' writhes in
pain, two bullet holes near his spine.
   Guns chatter. Buses and military vehicles blaze. Tracers flash
above the mausoleum of Mao Tse-tung, the father of Chinese communism.
   Government and student loudspeaker systems vie for attention.
   ``The government is corrupt! You've been tricked!'' a student
calls to the troops. ``Dear soldiers, you have sisters and
brothers!''
   A disembodied voice on the government loudspeaker orders the
square cleared and warns that anyone who remains will be responsible
for his own fate.
   Students insist they are not afraid.
   ``I'm very calm; I'm not afraid,'' says a 19-year-old from
Beijing Medical University. ``If the troops come, there's nothing I
can do.''
   2:45 a.m. _ A tank appears near the Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurant in the southwest corner and clears debris from the
western edge of the square of debris so military vehicles can pass.
   4:00 a.m. _ The lamp posts that dot the square go dark. Strains
of the Internationale, the socialist anthem, blare from student
loudspeakers.
   A singer from Taiwan on a hunger strike for democracy takes the
microphone and proclaims: ``We've achieved a big victory. ... We're
not afraid to die, but we've already lost too much blood.''
   4:35 a.m. _ The lights go back on and the students vote by voice
to leave. It is a close and heartbreaking decision.
   And so, near dawn on Sunday, it was over.
   Thousands of students filed out under the banners of their
schools, which had fluttered above the square during the 22-day
sit-in for a freer China.
   Students held hands as they left. Many sobbed.
   ``Go with us,'' they said to applauding Beijing residents. Some
shouted defiantly: ``We shall return!'' and others flashed the
V-for-victory sign, one of the symbols of the movement.
   Tanks rumbled into the square. One crushed the Goddess of
Democracy, the students' 33-foot styrofoam figure that looked
something like the Statue of Liberty.
   Dozens of armed soldiers secured the martyrs' monument and
thousands more sealed the entrances to the square.
   Tiananmen, the heart of China, was under military control.
   As they marched away at 6 a.m., students chanted ``Down with
fascists! Down with violence.''
   An armored personnel carrier followed on Changan Avenue,
Beijing's main boulevard. It sped into the rear ranks as if to make
the students move faster.
   Seven were crushed to death and four seriously injured. Other
students trying to help their classmates were kept back by tear gas
and bullets.
   At 7:30 a.m., convoys of soldiers move up and down Changan
Avenue, firing randomly, killing or wounding several people.
   A doctor and two nurses said at least 500 people had been killed
and estimates rose to 3,600 within days. The government said 300
were killed, most of them soldiers.
   ``My government has gone crazy,'' the doctor said, fingering his
bloody gown. ``This is the blood of China.''
   A street barricade of buses stopped a military convoy of 70
trucks, vans and armored personnel at Muxudi at about 10 a.m.
Sunday. People set the vehicles afire and the soldiers retreated.
   Blue and white helicopters flew to and from the square, picking
up white bags. Rumors spread that they were taking corpses to a
crematorium to hide evidence of a massacre.
   At 2 p.m., the bodies of nearly two dozen people shot down by
advancing troops at Muxudi lay haphazardly on the floor of Fuxing
Hospital to be identified by relatives and friends.
   Thousands of people filed through the blood-soaked room.
   Barricades were back up all over the city by 8 p.m.
   At Nanchizi, a small street heading north near Tiananmen Square,
angry people shouted insults at soldiers.
   About 20 troopers dashed up the side street, guns blazing. The
people scattered; couples ran into doorways, hand-in-hand. A woman
clutched her child and called out: ``Don't shoot my baby! Don't
shoot my baby!''

   On Monday morning, soldiers guarding the northern half of
Tiananmen Square were firing indiscriminately. Soldiers sprayed a
crowd of nearly 3,000 people with bullets near the main street
northeast of the square.
   Machine gun bullets stitched one man from his chin to his
stomach. Three others were shot down when 17 truckloads of troops
attacked a crowd at a major intersection west of Tiananmen Square.
   The city was a mess. Long lines formed for such staples as soy
sauce and cooking fuel. Prices for fruits, vegetables and meat
skyrocketed.
   Beijing mourned. Many people wore black armbands. Crowds formed
outside universities to support the students.
   Gunfire could be heard all night.

   On Tuesday afternoon, rumors spread that other units were

the applause of neighborhood residents.
   ``Exterminate the 27th Army! Avenge blood with blood!'' the crowd
chanted, handing eggs and cigarettes to the soldiers.

   At 10 a.m. Wednesday, thousands of soldiers left the city in a

they passed a residential compound for diplomats and other foreign
residents, the soldiers opened a withering fire.
   Bullets pierced windows in the compound but no injuries were
reported. Soldiers sealed off the area. Plainclothesmen searched the
area _ looking for a sniper, they said _ and took a Chinese man away.
   Foreigners began to flee Beijing.

<HEAD>English On Decline Among Some Students At Oxford, Of All Places</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The standard of written English among some Oxford
University students is so poor these days that tutoring may be
necessary, a professor says.
   Jack Pole, Rhodes Professor of American History at Oxford, blamed
the decline on Britain's schools, saying they offered pupils no
encouragement to attach any particular value to grammar and style in
writing.
   Pole also blamed sloppy language in the media.
   He said persistent offenders may have to be sent to a tutor, but
that most of the students were well-groomed in writing elegant
English.
   Pole's comments appeared in a weekly magazine, The Times Higher
Education Supplement, and was highlighted on the front page of The
Times of London with the headline: ``English like she is wrote amid
dreaming spires.''

<HEAD>Workshop Urges More Research on Alcohol and Aging</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small amounts of alcohol may help older people,
but a government workshop says alcohol abuse can worsen diseases of
the aging, particularly heart disease.
   More research is needed into the relationship between alcohol and
cardiovascular disease, especially as the population ages, the
workshop said in a report. Heart disease is the most common killer
of Americans 65 and older.
   The recommendations from the Surgeon General's Workshop on Health
Promotion and Aging were published Thursday by the federal Centers
for Disease Control.
   It noted that between 1950 and 1980 the number of Americans 65
and older increased from 12.5 million to 25.5 million, with the
largest increase in the 85-and-older group. The percentage of
Americans older than 65 is 12 percent now and will be 21.1 percent
by the year 2030, the report said.
   The effects of alcohol abuse on the elderly range from physical
and mental impairment to a worsening of some chronic illnesses, the
report said. These problems may be offset partly by benefits from
limited alcohol use, it said.
   Researchers at Stanford University reported in 1985 that people
who drink in moderation may reduce risk of heart disease, possibly
by increasing blood levels of certain proteins.
   The report said the apparent conflicting effects of large and
small doses of alcohol are most notable in cases of coronary artery
disease, which affects about 3.6 million Americans older than 65.
   Studies have confirmed that hypertension, a major contributor to
cardiovascular disease and stroke, increases in the elderly as
alcohol use increases. The report noted that hypertension is
especially common among the elderly in minority groups.
   Gregory Heath of the CDC's epidemiology section, who edited the
report, said the potential for harm is well established among heavy
drinkers. He said CDC studies define that as more than two drinks a
day, but other studies go as high as five a day.
   ``Other studies have demonstrated a possible beneficial link
between moderate levels of alcohol intake and (coronary artery
disease), although this relationship is controversial,'' the report
said.
   The report said that although aging Americans report they drink
less, their level of alcohol abuse appears to be about equal to the
8 percent found in the rest of the adult population.
   Heath said that the elderly tend to underreport their drinking
and that it is unclear whether the apparent decline in drinking as
Americans grow older is because drinkers become non-drinkers or
because the drinkers tend to die earlier.
   ``Researchers are on both sides of the fence on that one, and I
don't feel it's fair to comment one way or the other,'' he said.
   Heath said the physiological effects of alcohol on the elderly
still are being investigated, as is the interaction between alcohol
and medication.
   The elderly, he said, are more likely to be taking medication for
chronic diseases and may not know how alcohol interacts with that
medicine.
   ``They need to be advised by their physicians,'' he said.

<HEAD>AIDS Research by Salk Called Important but No Breakthrough</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Jonas Salk's report that an experimental
vaccine eliminated AIDS infection in two chimpanzees demonstrates
treatment for the deadly disease is possible, but scientists say it
is only one of several promising findings.
   ``These are the beginnings of progress we didn't have a year
ago,'' said Dani Bolognesi of Duke University, a leading authority
on AIDS vaccine research.
   Speaking Thursday at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS,
Bolognesi said researchers at the New England Primate Research
Center had blocked an AIDS-like infection in monkeys.
   And researchers at Repligen in Cambridge, Mass., working with
Bolognesi and others, showed that antibodies to a tiny portion of
the AIDS virus's outer surface could prevent infection in
chimpanzees.
   Much of the attention at the conference focused on Salk,
developer of the first polio vaccine in the 1950's. Salk himself
said, however, that his research did not constitute a breakthrough.
   ``We're on a path we think is worth pursuing,'' Salk said. ``We
haven't reached the end of it ... We're still in the exploratory
phase.''
   Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, one of the
discoverers of the AIDS virus, said Salk's vaccine could probably
never be given to people who had not already been infected by the
AIDS virus.
   The reason, he said, is that the vaccine is made of killed _ but
mostly intact _ AIDS virus.
   ``Who would take it? Who's going to guarantee that every virus
particle is dead?'' Gallo said. He noted that the Salk polio
vaccine, also made of killed virus, did in some cases give people
polio when it was processed incorrectly.
   He said it was unlikely the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
would ever approve such a vaccine for use in uninfected people to
prevent acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   ``There is no Salk AIDS vaccine here,'' Gallo said.
   Bolognesi, who summed up vaccine research at the AIDS conference,
did say, however, that Salk had made several intriguing and
surprising findings.
   In one study, Salk and Clarence Gibbs of the U.S. National
Institutes of Health injected four chimpanzees with high doses of
the AIDS virus, called the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. Two
had already been infected with AIDS and then vaccinated.
   A third had been vaccinated but not previously infected with
AIDS. A fourth was not vaccinated or infected.
   The two that had been infected and vaccinated fought off the new
infection. The vaccine worked.
   ``This in itself is a remarkable finding,'' Bolognesi said.
Before that, the consensus had been ``that once you are infected
with HIV you are infected for life,'' he said.
   ``I'm encouraged by what appears to be a rather powerful effect
on an existing infection.''
   The chimp that was vaccinated but not previously infected
developed an infection when given a high dose of AIDS virus, but
that infection is slowly subsiding, Salk said.
   The fourth chimp, which was not vaccinated, developed an ongoing
AIDS infection after being injected with HIV.
   Salk also tested his vaccine on 19 patients with AIDS-related
complex or ARC, a condition that often precedes AIDS. The results
were less encouraging than those in the chimpanzees.
   The 19 patients have remained stable for a year without taking
AZT or other drugs, said one of Salk's collaborators, Dr. Alexandra
Levine of the University of Southern California.
   The studies showed the vaccine was not toxic and that it could
boost the patients' immune reponse to the AIDS virus.
   Injections of bits of the AIDS virus under the patients' skins
showed that they had developed what's called ``cellular immunity''
to AIDS. That is, not only did they fight it with antibodies, they
also fought it with certain white blood cells intended to defend
against infections.
   After the third boosters, more than half of the subjects
demonstrated this cellular immunity, Levine said. But the vaccine
did not eliminate infection in any of them, as it did in the
chimpanzees.
   Salk said he hoped the vaccine might protect against illness by
limiting the infection, even if it doesn't prevent it.
   Gallo said chimpanzees are naturally more resistant to the AIDS
virus than are humans. Success with them therefore might not
translate to humans.

   Veterans of the pioneering
X-15 program gathered to swap ``Right Stuff'' tales about
edge-of-space flight before the breakthroughs of space shots and
space shuttles.
   Three decades ago the rocket-powered X-15 ``spaceplane'' first
soared 67 miles over the desert and helped usher in a new era in
aeronautics. Fifty miles above Earth was considered the edge of
space, earning coveted astronaut wings for Air Force fliers in the
X-15 program.
   The three X-15 hypersonic research aircraft flew 199 flights in
one of the most successful aeronautical programs ever conducted.
   Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, was among
the dozen or so military and civilian test pilots who flew the X-15
during the program operated jointly by the Air Force, Navy and
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The pilots recalled their adventures Thursday at a reunion
honoring them.
   ``This is kind of our last hurrah,'' said Milt Thompson, 63, an
X-15 veteran.
   Others attending included Scott Crossfield, whose exploits were
chronicled in Tom Wolfe's saga of the Space Age, ``The Right
Stuff,'' and retired Air Force Col. Pete Knight who went on to
become mayor of the nearby desert community of Palmdale.
   Another was Joe Engle, the only X-15 pilot to go on to command a
space shuttle. He made 16 X-15 flights and two orbital missions in
the shuttle.
   ``I like being around pilots,'' Engle said in a telephone
interview on Thursday night.
   ``When I grow up, I'm going to be one,'' he quipped.
   He said his experiences in the X-15 were among the most
professionally rewarding of a high-flying career.
   ``Every time you flew the X-15, you knew you were logging data
for designs (of aircraft and spacecraft) that hadn't even been
thought of yet,'' he said.
   The wicked-looking black needle-nosed rocket plane would arc
across the sky so quickly that the pilot feared he was aiming
straight for the Pacific Ocean, said Thompson, now chief engineer
for NASA at the Ames-Dryden Research Facility.
   ``That was the geometry of it,'' he said. ``It was just flying
that fast.''
   The first X-15 flight was on June 8, 1959 and the final flight on
Oct. 24, 1968, a $300 million program that was the last in a
venerable line of research rocket planes. Chuck Yeager broke the
sound barrier in 1947 in the Bell X-1 that he dubbed ``Glamorous
Glennis'' in honor of his wife.
   After flying the X-15, Thompson said he moved away from flight
test ``because everything was winding down.'' There would not be
another research plane as rewarding to pilot, he lamented.
   A total of three X-15 rocket planes were built and one was
destroyed in an accident in 1967. Air Force Maj. Michael Adams died
in that crash when the X-15 broke up while diving from an altitude
of 265,000 feet
   The original design goal for the X-15 was 4,000 mph, but the
aircraft eventually flew at more than six times the speed of sound,
which is 760 mph. In addition to reaching a maximum 4,520 mph, it
soared to 345,200 feet.
   The flights allowed researchers to perform many experiments on a
repeated basis that aided in developing space technology. The
capabilities and limitations of the human pilot in flying space
trajectories and re-entry maneuvers and conditions were thoroughly
explored.
   The success of the X-15 design, development and flight program
allowed the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo spaceflight programs to
accelerate.
   ``When it became clear that the Space Age was upon us and the
need to put a human into Earth orbit became a matter of national
urgency, a massive backlog of aerospace technology was already at
hand in the X-15 program,'' said John V. Becker of NASA's Langley
Research Center in Hampton, Va.
   Years later, the space shuttle's landing characteristics would be
designed to emulate the X-15.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., has suggested a
pilot program which could eventually mean that Congress will recycle
the 20,000 tons of trash generated annually by Capitol buildings.
   Boschwitz has asked the Rules Committee to consider a recycling
program for the entire Capitol complex, which includes the Supreme
Court, Library of Congress and six congressional office buildings.
   ``If we don't set the example certainly it won't be set
elsewhere,'' Boschwitz said Thursday during a news conference.
   The Capitol Architect's office has suggested the government begin
recycling garbage from the Russell Senate Office Building and the
Rayburn House Office Building, which together house about 5,000

<HEAD>Services Can Save Money If They Rely on Ads</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Use of advertising rather than cash bonuses or
more recruiters is the best way to save money for the military,
according to studies.
   The reports were issued by the Rand Corp., a Pentagon-supported
think tank based in Santa Monica, Calif. One focused on Army
advertising efforts and the other assessing whether the services
should do their own ads or ``joint'' ads with the other armed forces.
   The Army study concluded that advertising does make a difference
in an era of the all-volunteer military and cuts in the ad budget
will hurt.
   As for individual ``service'' advertisements compared to
``joint'' ads, the second study concluded both types ``appear to be
very powerful tools'' and in general can produce a new recruit for
roughly the same outlay of cash.

   Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy
banners and the tents of China's freedom movement, replaced by
tanks, armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers.
   The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first
glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the
capital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement
for political change.
   Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for city
residents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeks
stood at the heart of the movement. Buses and bicyclists today were
allowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge of
the square.
   The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a
33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, was taken by a
tread-wheeled armored personnel carrier. When students built the
statue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movement
for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. On Sunday
morning, a tank crushed it.
   In all, 80 tanks and 40 armored personnel carriers lined the
northern part of the square.
   The Monument to Revolutionary Martyrs, where the students took a
final stand early Sunday, was swept clean. Poems and posters calling
for a more open China have disappeared from its sides.
   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and
60,000 injured over the weekend, citing a Chinese students'
organization, the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany. The
government says nearly 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed;
diplomats and Chinese say up to 3,000 died.
   Soldiers drilled in Tiananmen's center, their cadenced shouting
echoing around the vast expanse. A crowd of officials stood on the
roof of the Great Hall of the People, overlooking the square. From
this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant
mass of demonstrators enveloped 5,000 troops and blocked their entry
to the square.
   Inside the square, soldiers could be seen shuffling about, their
uniformed jackets stripped off, wash basins in hand. There was a
relaxed air of the inside of an army barracks as unarmed troops
carried food and walked slowly together, talking and laughing in
groups.
   The area once housing students' tents has become a holding area
for a huge fleet of troop trucks.
   On the southern perimeter, a single line of tanks and a cordon of
soldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists who
pedaled slowly by, peering into Tiananmen.
   Near the square, troops placed barbed wire in front of one
street. Soldiers were billeted in a construction site, their
laundered fatigues drying on the scaffolding. Next door, troops,
their assault rifles slung nonchalantly over their shoulders, stood
and chatted outside a discotheque.
   ``They look like they ,'' said one local resident. ``I hope they
know that we still don't want them here.''

<HEAD>`Superboy' Actor Lied in Having Driving Ticket Withdrawn, Officials
Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He may leap tall buildings, but motor
vehicles pose a problem for Superboy, and straight shooting with the
law doesn't appear to be a strong suit either.
   John Newton, 23, who plays the lead in the syndicated television
series ``Superboy,'' persuaded a local sheriff and a judge in March
to withdraw a $52 careless driving ticket, saying his image would be
hurt by the citation and claiming he had no previous tickets.
   The TV star's rental car had nearly hit a deputy's patrol car in
a shopping center in January.
   But records show Newton since 1982 had at least four other
traffic tickets _three in North Carolina and one in New York _ and
had his driver's license suspended twice. One of the citations was
issued in New York City, the others in North Carolina.
   ``I can't believe the guy did this. We took the man at his word.
I guess a man is only as good as his word,'' Orange Country
Sheriff's spokesman Jim Solomons said Thursday.
   No further action against the actor is planned, Solomons said.
``You can't reissue a ticket that's been dismissed,'' he said.
   ``Superboy'' is syndicated by Viacom Enterprises and produced at
Disney-MGM Studios in the Orlando area.
   Filming was suspended for the summer and Newton could not be
reached for comment.

<HEAD>Academic Experts Say Chinese Military Will Unite Behind Hard-Liners</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some Chinese army officers favor the goals of the
democracy movement, but the military as a whole is still largely
sympathetic to hard-liners who ordered the recent crackdown,
academic experts on China say.
   Any conflicts within the military over the handling of student
unrest are unlikely to flare into major confrontations among army
units, they say.
   ``The army has always opted for unity. The instinct of most
Chinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy instead of breaking
up,'' said Harvey Jencks, a research associate at the University of
California at Berkeley and an expert on the Chinese military.
   Economic reforms have increased inflation in China, eroding the
value of military wages and making the army sympathetic to hard-line
policies, many experts said.
   ``The military leadership has more to gain from a conservative
economic policy because their wages are hurting from inflation,''
said June Teufel Dreyer, an expert on the People's Liberation Army
who teaches political science at the University of Miami.
   ``These kids in the army are there grudgingly and are not
sophisticated. They will protect themselves first,'' she said.
   The Chinese experts also said many army officers have their
careers tied to the Communist Party and the privileges of rank, and
are unlikely to rebel.
   ``The officer corps of the PLA is made up almost exclusively of
Chinese Communist Party members,'' said Jurgen Domes, a West German
professor who is a visiting scholar at the Center for Chinese
Studies at Berkeley.
   ``A sizeable majority are second-generation military, members of
a privileged class whose privilege is bound to their position in the
military.''
   Domes said these second-generation officers have fewer options _
and, therefore, a higher stake in the status quo _ than student
dissidents who are sons and daughters of party cadres.
   The intellectuals have had the opportunity to go abroad or seek a
variety of posts in the civilian sector, Domes said.
   Even those who see support in the army for the student movement
don't see it leading to open conflict in the ranks.
   ``Some middle-rank officers have been infected with the virus of
democracy, but the life of the Chinese soldier has not been a
red-hot one under the economic reforms,'' said Harvey Nelsen, a
professor at the University of South Florida. ``The average soldier
is an ill-educated peasant with little understanding of the issues.''
   Domes agreed, saying that 40 percent of the army's rank-and-file
are ``illiterate peasants with no understanding or even awareness''
of the principles for which pro-democracy activists are striving.
   Unlike others, Jencks saw widespread army support for the student
protesters, but he predicted the desire for unity would prevail.
   ``Probably, a majority of the army sympathizes with the students,
but they won't shoot each other over it,'' he said.
   Nelsen was the only academician interviewed by The Associated
Press who saw substantial political divisions between the 27th Army
and other army units. The 27th Army is believed to have carried out
the brunt of attacks against demonstrators in Beijing since June 3.
   Nelsen, who traveled to China last month and has written a book
on the Chinese military, said the divisions were unlikely to lead to
serious fighting but could help reformers win the battle within the
country's leadership.
   ``If the 27th remains isolated, they are likely to do a lot of
posturing and intimidation, but finally they will surrender, and the
reformers will win,'' he said.
   Domes said he agreed with U.S.-based Chinese student leader Pei
Minxin, who said in a television interview Wednesday that rumors of
military infighting and imminent civil war were a ruse by the
Chinese leadership.
   Domes speculated that troops had been moved in and out of Beijing
to create an illusion of dissension and frighten foreigners into
fleeing. Then, Domes predicted, few would remain to witness the
arrest or execution of many more dissidents.
   He said at least 15 million to 18 million Chinese have been
killed for political reasons since the Communists took power in 1949.
   ``The only difference this time is that it was captured by
television cameras,'' he said.

   Not to be outdone by CBS, whose Dan Rather
reported from the scene in Beijing during the student uprising, NBC
has sent anchorman Tom Brokaw there, and ABC's Ted Koppel plans to
depart for China this weekend.
   Koppel will report, beginning next week, on ``World News
Tonight'' and ``Nightline,'' and will complete a ``Koppel Report''
news special on the unrest in China.
   Rather and CNN's Bernard Shaw were the only two U.S. anchormen in
China when the student demonstrations for democracy exploded into a
big story last month.
   Both got prime-time exposure _ Rather in the middle of the season
finale of ``Dallas'' _ with live coverage of their negotiations to
keep Chinese officials from shutting off satellite transmissions.
   Brokaw and ABC anchorman Peter Jennings, while praising their own
networks' coverage in China, expressed disappointment that they had
not been there themselves for one of the biggest stories of the year.
   CBS had sent Rather and company to Beijing for the visit of
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, but the student demonstrations
became the big story. Rather returned from China two weeks ago,
before the military began firing on Beijing citizens.
   Brokaw was going as most Americans were leaving China on the
State Department's advice because of the threat of continued
violence.
   There have been numerous reports of journalists and camera crews
being roughed up by the military. Camera coverage has had to be
surreptitious, and film and videotape is hand-carried out of the
country.
   NBC News had announced that correspondent Garrick Utley would be
sent to help cover the China story, but a spokeswoman said Thursday
that Brokaw went instead because he had already obtained a visa, and
Utley didn't have one.
   Because there is no live transmission capability out of China,
Utley will anchor ``NBC Nightly News'' from New York, with Brokaw
providing live telephone reports during the broadcast.

   After 36 hours on and off the phone, Liu
Yuan still snaps to attention when the telephone rings, its flashing
red light a possible harbinger of news from Beijing.
   For nearly a week, Liu and his friends at the 24-hour hot line in
this Boston suburb have ferried information in and out of China on
three phone lines and a borrowed fax machine, dodging a government
blackout with the high-tech tools of the information age.
   ``We send the materials by fax machine and now we're finding out
that's like a weapon,'' Liu said Thursday.
   In China, the state-controlled media initially informed viewers
that not one person had died in Tiananmen Square. But the government
later said 300 people had died. The Chinese Red Cross said about
3,600 died in the violence.
   Bit by bit, horrifying stories of bloodshed and bravery are being
beamed across the world by computer, by fax and by phone.
   ``Networks are invisible. The only thing that will bring a halt
to this is stopping the Chinese phone system,'' said Jessica
Lipnack, a researcher with the Newton-based Networking Institute.
   In a particularly defiant gesture, the Newton group sent
newspaper articles by fax to a company managed by the son of Deng
Xiaoping, Liu said.
   ``We believe that people who work for that company ... they
should hear the truth,'' he said.
   ``We just feel like that's a victory,'' he added, flashing a rare
grin.
   Early Thursday, Liu spoke with student activists in Shanghai, who
told him demonstrators packed the streets and workers were virtually
on strike.
   Chinese students, many of them studying technology and science,
went to their terminals early in the tense standoff, beaming out
messages through international networks.
   From East Berlin to Canada to Princeton, N.J., dispatches moved,
expressing solidarity, relaying information phoned out of China and
bringing the informal network of Chinese students together.
   Xu Ruiming, who's studying physics at Brandeis University, has
made it part of his routine to constantly check his computer for
electronic mail.
   ``There are a lot of messages I've received. But the problem is
it's hard to tell if it's a rumor or real news,'' he said.
   Keeping control of the wildly flying rumors is one of the hardest
parts of the unofficial news service, Liu said, leading students to
shy away from all but verified facts and photographed evidence.
   They plan to keep the phone lines open as long as their money
holds out. Their phone bill is approaching $30,000.

<TEXT>
   Most successful film directors would no more
make a TV show than Lee Iacocca would drive a Yugo, but a takeoff
from a creepy comic book series has lured three big-screen hotshots.
   Hollywood directors Walter Hill, Richard Donner and Robert
Zemeckis made the first three segments of ``Tales From the Crypt,''
which debut on Home Box Office Saturday and play throughout the
month.
   ``Obviously, we are doing this for fun,'' said Hill, the director
of ``48HRS,'' ``The Warriors'' and ``Red Heat.'' ``This is an art
form. These E.C. Comics are a unique contribution to the art
tradition in this country.''
   The original 1950s comic book series, created by William Gaines,
was lambasted by a variety of public officials for its violence and
macabre themes. A Santa Claus wielding an ax was at home in the
``Crypt'' comics. The comics became the subject of a Senate
subcommittee hearing on juvenile delinquency.
   Gaines eventually lost interest in Entertaining Comics to devote
time to his next creation, Mad magazine.
   The high-priced directors each made one 30-minute episode.
   Other film directors _ Mary (``Pet Sematary'') Lambert and Howard
(``Pretty in Pink''') Deutch _ will make other episodes.
   While most of the movies the three directors make cost upwards of
$30 million apiece, the ``Tales from the Crypt'' episodes averaged
$850,000.
   Zemeckis, who filmed his episode between making ``Who Framed
Roger Rabbit'' and tackling two sequels for ``Back to the Future,''
said a small project was a relief.
   ``I didn't want extras. I didn't want exteriors. I didn't want
cars. I wanted to try and do something suspenseful,'' he said. ``I
didn't want to scout locations and build 20 sets and do all that.''
   Hill described his episode as ``not so much a horror story as it
is an examination of the horrible.''
   His chapter follows an out-of-work executioner who can't seem to
shake his old work habits. After the death penalty is outlawed, he
insists on electrocuting the guilty on a free-lance basis.
   The episode by Donner, director of ``The Omen,'' ``Superman'' and
``Lethal Weapon,'' chronicles the exploits of a death-defying
carnival star, who may have tempted fate once too often. The story
is presented with cartoonish editing and exaggerated acting.
   Zemeckis' ``Crypt'' episode features a suddenly single mother
defending her home on Christmas Eve from a Santa Claus who studied
toy making at the local insane asylum.
   ``I wanted it to have humor, and obviously the humor is very
black,'' he said. ``I wanted it to be true to the comic book. Why do
`Tales from the Crypt' if you can't do it the right way? And those
were the ground rules.''

<TEXT>
   The crazed fan who knifed actress Theresa
Saldana may never be freed to pursue his death mission, but she
still fears the man will someday get out and try to kill her.
   ``I am so grateful he will not be walking out next week. It is
buying some time,'' Miss Saldana said Thursday after learning Arthur
Jackson's death threats from a prison cell may keep him behind bars
indefinitely.
   One week before his parole date, District Attorney Ira Reiner
charged Jackson with eight counts of threatening the actress and her
rescuer in 1987 and 1988.
   The new charges carry a total of seven years and eight months in
prison, but because of Jackson's mental history the 53-year-old
Scottish drifter could be kept in prison or in a psychiatric
facility for many years.
   ``He could receive a life term for this, given his deranged
mental state, because the laws have been changed,'' Reiner said.
``Our objective, quite simply, is to keep him off the street.''
   Jackson, whose obsession with the ``Raging Bull'' actress led to
the 1982 attack, had been given a June 15 good-behavior parole date
after serving seven years of a 12-year sentence for the stabbing.
   Miss Saldana was attacked outside her West Hollywood apartment
and stabbed 10 times by Jackson, whose thrusts bent the blade of his
kitchen knife. It was water deliveryman Jeff Fenn, now a county
sheriff's deputy, who pulled Jackson off the actress.
   In letters to her and Fenn over the years, Jackson vowed to carry
out his death mission. The eight counts involve five letters sent to
Miss Saldana and three to Fenn.
   ``I swear on the ashes of my dead mother and on the scars of
Theresa Saldana that neither God nor I will rest in peace until the
special request in my solemn petition has been granted,'' he said in
one letter.
   In that same letter, Jackson said he regretted using a knife
because ``a gun would have given me a better chance of reunion with
you in heaven.''
   ``Jackson will serve additional years for as long as he continues
to terrorize Miss Saldana,'' said Assemblyman Richard Katz, who
drafted the 1986 law that would keep Jackson incarcerated.
   Under Katz' law, additional years can be added to an inmate's
sentence for each threat of violence committed by the felon.
   The actress said she is unconvinced he will never be turned loose.
   ``This nightmare is far from being resolved and there is a long
road ahead. This is only a stopgap. It gives us time to work for
legislation preventing him and others like him from ever being
released,'' she said.

<HEAD>Polls Show Close Race For Va. GOP Nomination</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three polls released in the final week of
the high-stakes Republican gubernatorial primary in Virginia show
former Sen. Paul S. Trible Jr. in a tight race with two rivals.
   The candidates have raised $9.8 million for Tuesday's primary,
the first held by the state GOP in 40 years.
   That matches the entire budget for both sides of the 1985
governor's race, won by Democrat Gerald L. Baliles, who by law
cannot run for a second term.
   A Mason-Dixon Opinion Research Inc. poll Thursday of 800 probable
voters showed Trible with 31 percent support to 30 percent for
former Attorney General J. Marshall Coleman and 27 percent for 8th
District Rep. Stanford E. Parris.
   On Wednesday, a Washington Post poll showed Trible and Coleman
dead even _ 31 percent each among 602 likely voters _ with Parris
trailing at 24 percent.
   Trible previously was the front-runner in the race and earlier
polls showed that he alone would be favored in a head-to-head
contest with the Democratic contender, Lt. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder,
who would be the nation's first elected black governor.
   The third poll, released Wednesday by state House Minority Leader
Raymond R. ``Andy'' Guest Jr., who earlier dropped out of the race,
questioned that assessment.
   It showed Trible leading Wilder 49 percent to 42 percent, Coleman
leading Wilder 46 percent to 43 percent, and Parris leading Wilder
45 percent to 42 percent.
   The poll did not evaluate the three candidates against each other.
   Trible spokesman John Miller questioned the validity of the
surveys. ``We haven't seen anything that looks like these numbers in
any other poll,'' he said.
   Dennis Peterson, an aide to Coleman, said the polls show Trible's
support has slipped. ``We felt that the momentum always has been
away from Paul,'' Peterson said.
   The sampling error in the polls ranged from 3{ percent to 5
percent.
   Coleman, 46, lost the 1981 governor's race to Charles Robb.
Parris, 59, was an unsuccessful contender for the gubernatorial
nomination in 1985.
   Trible, 42, was elected to the Senate in 1982 and did not seek
re-election last year in order to run for governor. His seat was won
by Robb, a Democrat.
   Susan Fitz-Hugh, secretary of the state Board of Elections, has
estimated that turnout could be as low as 250,000 for the first GOP
gubernatorial primary in Virginia since 1949. In the intervening
years, candidates have been chosen in convention.
   The state has 2.6 million registered voters, all of whom are
eligible to participate because registration in Virginia is not by
party.
   In reports filed Monday with Ms. Fitz-Hugh's office, Coleman led
in fund-raising with $3.5 million but had the least available cash
in the final week of the campaign, about $31,000. Trible had raised
$3.2 million and had $290,000 to spend; Parris had raised $3.1
million and had more than $410,000 in the bank.
   Wilder, meanwhile, reported $2.5 million in fund-raising, said
spokeswoman Laura Dillard, and would have about $2 million left to
spend after the nominating convention this weekend.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Stocks Off Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose Friday against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo while stock prices fell moderately.
   The dollar closed the week at 143.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from
Thursday's close of 143.05 yen. After opening at the day's low of
143.25 yen, the U.S. currency ranged as high as 143.65 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225
selected issues, which gained 91.40 points Thursday, shed 78.31
points, or 0.23 percent, closing at 33,639.98.
   A trader with the Bank of Tokyo said the dollar ``remains firm.''
   Combining to support the dollar was the political unrest in
China, cross tradings by which traders buy dollars to sell the yen
and buy the West German mark, and dollar-buying on the spot, said
the dealer who spoke anonymously.
   Other traders said the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank,
stepped into the market to brake the dollar's up-swing with little
effect, selling dollars at around 143.30 yen.
   The central bank does not customarily comment on its
market-intervention.
   On the stock market, the market's main barometer opened firmer
but drifted slightly downward to be mixed late morning session.
   Brokers said the stock market would remain directionless the rest
of the trading day as many investors hesitated to take new positions
ahead of the weekend.

   Terese James and her husband Wu Wei began their life
together with a ``honeymoon'' they will never forget.
   Ms. James, 24, met her 26-year-old husband while she was teaching
at the Beijing Forestry University in the northwestern university
district of the Chinese capital.
   When the student pro-democracy movement ignited after the death
of ousted Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on April 15, the couple
decided to marry and prepared to leave the country.
   But when troops stormed Tiananmen Square in central Beijing last
weekend, Wu was thousands of miles away in the southern city of
Canton, obtaining a U.S. immigration visa.
   ``We were really afraid something like this was going to
happen,'' Ms. James said after arriving in Tokyo on Thursday aboard
a flight chartered by the U.S. State Department.
   Events overtook their planning, and when Beijing erupted in
violence, the woman from Liberty City, Texas, was in Beijing with
the couple's airplane tickets, while her husband was stuck in Canton
with the passports.
   ``I was hearing firing at night and seeing dead bodies piled
inside the gates of the university. At least 300 students at our
school died and more are missing,'' she said.
   While Wu was away, Ms. James spend time with his mother, a nurse
at the university. She saw her treat the wounds of hundreds of
students hurt in troop attacks.
   In the streets the next day, ``Soldiers were stripping bodies of
identification and burning them. There were scavengers. Burnt trucks
were smoldering and trees were scorched,'' she said.
   The soldiers were growing increasingly anti-American, Ms. James
said. ``They're blaming what happened on Western influence.''
   On Sunday night, after failing to convince embassy employees to
rescue her from campus, her sister-in-law found a driver to take her
to the airport, she said.
   ``That man was great,'' Ms. James said. ``He had me lie down in
the back seat so I wouldn't be seen, and drove me through areas
occupied by troops. There was gunfire.''
   She spent over three days waiting in the airport _ first for Wu,
and then for a flight out.
   ``While we were sleeping on the floor, every time a door slammed,
I cringed. I haven't really slept for three days,'' Ms. James said.
   ``We had to pay for food, water, tickets. We have no money
left,'' she said as the couple prepared to board a flight for San
Francisco, where they arrived later Thursday.
   Wu said he was glad to get out.
   ``We planned to leave China, but we didn't expect it to be like
this,'' he said.

   Despite scattered reports of skirmishes between
soldiers, the threat appears to be fading that rival military
factions would fight over the attack on demonstrators on Tiananmen
Square.
   The 27th Army sickened the citizens of Beijing with its bloody
suppression of a pro-democracy movement. The weekend attack left
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people dead in the city center.
   Other units of the People's Liberation Army soon entered the
capital to the cheers of the people, who believed the new soldiers
had orders to crush the hated 27th, which had remained lodged in
Tiananmen Square.
   A military confrontation seemed imminent earlier this week with
scattered reports of soldiers fighting soldiers inside Beijing and
artillery fire.
   Different units were said to be loyal to rival politicians, with
the 27th supporting hard-line President Yang Shangkun and others
favoring moderate leaders who opposed the crackdown.
   In addition, the 27th Army's withering gunfire and tank advance
not only killed civilians but also took its toll on soldiers from
other military units that got in the way, according to a Western
diplomat.
   But the recent arrivals have not taken up positions of battle.
Instead, they have brandished brooms to sweep the streets clean.
They have chatted amiably with curious citizens.
   The new forces were deployed to win propaganda points for the
People's Liberation Army by providing ``an acceptable face'' to
Beijing citizens, not to fight their fellow soldiers, one Western
diplomat said.
   The introduction of ``friendly'' troops clearly has helped pacify
the Beijing residents, who no longer are gathering in the streets in
large numbers to protest the weekend massacre.
   The likelihood that some or all of the 27th Army have left
Tiananmen Square without battling other troops also suggests units
are not about to fight each other.
   Tanks of the 27th Army that took up positions on strategic
bridges leading downtown were formed not to defend against a rival
military force but to deter a ``people power'' uprising, the
diplomat said.
   ``One would like to think they were factionalized ... but there
is no evidence,'' he said.
   Other experts doubt that differences within the military over the
imposition of martial law on Beijing to end the pro-democracy
movement and the use of force against unarmed citizens will lead to
major factional fighting.
   ``Probably, a majority of the army sympathizes with the students,
but they won't shoot each other over it,'' said Harvey Jencks, a
research associate at the University of California at Berkeley who
is an expert on the Chinese military.
   ``The army has always opted for unity,'' Jencks said. ``The
instinct of most Chinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy
instead of breaking up.''
   The latest government policy is an intensified crackdown against
the pro-democracy activists. New martial law edicts issued Thursday
order movement leaders to give themselves up and urged residents to
turn in fellow citizens who took party in ``hooliganism and
destruction.''
   It is not yet clear to what degree the army will help enforce
those martial law orders.

   Maine winters notwithstanding, spies who
come in from the cold seem drawn to the Kennebunks.
   This coastal town and neighboring Kennebunkport are home to a
cluster of former intelligence operatives, analysts and
administrators who have chosen the area as a good place to retire or
to build a second career.
   The best-known former spy master is, of course, President Bush, a
lifelong summer resident of Kennebunkport who was appointed director
of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1976.
   But many of those once involved in clandestine activities have
settled here year-round, creating a small and not-so-secretive
community of retired spies.
   This weekend, several of the world's leading writers on
intelligence will be among 130 people expected to gather in
Kennebunkport for the fifth anniversary meeting of the New England
chapter of the Association of Former Intelligence Officers.
   The keynote speaker will be James McCargar, a 16-year
intelligence veteran who, under the pen name Christopher Felix,
wrote ``A Short Course in the Secret War,'' hailed as a classic in
the history of intelligence. Another speaker will be Rupert Allason,
a member of Parliament who, as Nigel West, has written extensively
about British intelligence.
   Bush, an AFIO life member, will be out of town and unable to
attend the meeting near his vacation compound.
   Four of the chapter's 11 directors are from Kennebunk or
Kennebunkport. It's believed that at least a dozen former
intelligence officers make their homes in the two towns.
   After a 30-year CIA career that took him to places like China and
Iran, Ernest Weidul retired to Kennebunkport where his wife is an
artist; another CIA veteran, Barbara Storer, is in the real estate
business.
   Retired Maj. Gen. Edmund R. Thompson, president of the regional
chapter and former Army assistant chief of staff for intelligence,
lives in Kennebunk and attributes the cluster to coincidence and to
the area's attractiveness as a retirement community.
   But others suggest social dynamics of intelligence work played a
role in attracting them to the area.
   At the onset of the Cold War, the CIA targeted its recruiting
efforts toward prep school and Ivy League college graduates, often
picking members of old-line Boston, New York and Philadelphia
families.
   Many of those families spent summers along the Maine coast, said
Allan A. Swenson of Kennebunk, an AFIO chapter director who was
involved in military and civilian intelligence.
   Swenson, now a book publishing executive, said those summer
connections drew many looking for a place to retire.
   He also said those involved in intelligence work often are part
of a close-knit group that made few friends on the outside. ``You
can't talk to many people because people are not supposed to know
what you're doing,'' Swenson said.
   The group, which has 150 members in New England, tries to dispel
the James Bond image and provide a more realistic understanding of
the nature of intelligence work.
   ``The guy jumping behind enemy lines, sneaking and peeking,
that's all TV, that's LeCarre,'' Swenson said.
   It's the details of intelligence work that excite many.
   In a tour sponsored by the group last year, former spy masters
went to World War II intelligence sites in England. A highlight was
visiting the development site of the Enigma machine that deceived
Nazi cryptologists.

<TEXT>
   Some leading scientists think the Soviet
Union's Chernobyl nuclear plant exploded like a nuclear bomb,
something the nuclear industry has said could not happen.
   In an article in today's Technology Review, scientists gave
conflicting views on whether the April 1986 Chernobyl accident,
which killed 31 people and spread radiation thousands of miles, was
caused by a nuclear explosion.
   The article in the journal, published by the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, said similar accidents could happen at 13
other reactors in the Soviet Union, but ``the possibility of such an
accident in a U.S. reactor is vanishingly small.''
   William Sweet, the article's author, interviewed scientists and
specialists at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department
of Energy in an effort to reach a consensus on the accident.
   ``A runaway nuclear reaction set off a chain of events that
severely damaged the reactor core and surrounding structures,''
Sweet wrote. ``This damage set the stage for a second explosion
which was much more violent than the first and almost certainly was
a full-fledged nuclear explosion.''
   But Themis Speis, deputy research chief at the NRC, said it was
``very misleading'' to call the accident a nuclear explosion.
   ``The reactor went out of control, but the time it took to raise
the temperature and pressure is many orders of magnitude smaller
than it takes to get an atomic bomb going,'' he said.
   John Ahearne, former NRC chairman, said, ``I wouldn't call it a
nuclear explosion.''
   But Harvard University physics professor Richard Wilson said,
``It was a nuclear explosion; there's no doubt, because the ultimate
source of energy was nuclear.''
   The argument is one of semantics, said Gregory Van Tuyle, a
nuclear engineer at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
   The plant was not destroyed by a steam explosion as scientists
had believed, but ``power grew to very large levels very rapidly,''
he said. ``The phrase `nuclear explosion' is not inappropriate.''
   Sweet said the reaction at Chernobyl was unlike a bomb in that it
gave off less energy and produced it more slowly than a bomb.
   But reports suggest the reactor's fuel formed a critical mass,
reacted uncontrollably, melted and vaporized, he said.
   It ``would be deeply misleading to say that the plant did not
blow up like an atomic bomb,'' he said.
   ``Ever since the first nuclear power plants were built in the
1950s, the industry has insisted they can't explode like bombs,''
Sweet said. ``Chernobyl casts doubt on whether that is true of all
power reactors.''
   Sweet is a reporter at Physics Today, which is published by the
American Institute of Physics.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two simultaneous explosions today shook
west Beirut's seaside boulevard near a Syrian army checkpoint.
Police said at least one person was killed and two wounded.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the two
blasts, which a police spokesman said devastated two vans and hurled
the body of a coffee vendor into the Mediterranean Sea.
   Rescuers jumped into the water and swam toward the corpse, which
was last seen off the rocky beach in the Raouche district.
   The blasts shattered the vans and scattered their gutted parts
across a 300-foot radius. Vendors had sold refreshments to
passers-by from the vans.
   Civil defense rescuers doused a fire that blazed in one of the
vans.
   Helmeted Syrian soldiers fired their AK-47 assault rifles into
the air so ambulances could get through the crowd that rushed to the
blast scene.
   Ambulances, their sirens wailing, were dispatched to the
explosion site from civil defense centers in Syrian-policed west
Beirut.
   ``Private cars evacuated two wounded men,'' said traffic police
Sgt. Kamel Abdallah, who waved cars off the main boulevard at
Raouche minutes after the blasts.
   A barefoot woman, wearing a light green dress, pleaded with
Syrian soldiers to let her cross a checkpoint to the blast scene to
inquire about her husband.
   ``He likes to have his morning coffee (here). He surely was here,
please let me pass,'' the woman said. She sobbed repeatedly while
talking to the Syrian soldier.
   ``Go away woman!'' the soldier yelled back. ``Only the coffee
vendor was killed.''
   The police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
rules, said explosives experts were examining the gutted wreckage of
the two vans to determine the exact nature of the blasts.
   As the explosions were reported, a nearby Syrian artillery
battery fired three 130mm howitzer shells into the Christian-held
coast north of Beirut.
   Shelling the Christian coast has been a daily practice by Syrian
artillery batteries since May 26, when Arab leaders called a
cease-fire in the 12-week confrontation between Christian army
commander Michel Aoun's units and their Moslem and Syrian foes.
   The Syrians say it is to prevent Gen. Aoun from obtaining war
materiel by sea.
   The police spokesman said the three shells exploded around the
port of Jounieh. No casualties were reported.
   The latest fighting in Lebanon's 14-year civil war began on March
8. Not counting today's fatalities, 363 people have been killed and
1,432 wounded since then.
   It began after Aoun ordered a blockade of illegal ports run by
Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut because they deprive the
state treasury of about $100 million in customs dues annually.
   Syrian troops and allied militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's militia retaliated by blockading the Christian enclave,
where about 1 million people live.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Against Yen, Stocks Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose today against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo despite yen-buying by the central bank, while stock prices
fell moderately, traders said.
   The dollar ended the week at 143.50 yen, up 0.45 yen from
Thursday's close of 143.05 yen. After opening at 143.25 yen, the
day's low, the currency ranged as high as 143.65 yen.
   ``Despite market intervention by the central bank, the dollar
continued to rise gradually throughout the day,'' said Naoto
Kawamura, a senior dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The Bank of Japan stepped into the market at around 143.30 yen
during the morning session in an attempt to stem the dollar's
up-swing, but with little effect, dealers said. The bank usually
does not comment officially on its market interventions.
   Kawamura said market players were waiting for the release of U.S.
wholesale price figures due out later Friday. ``The U.S. Federal
Reserve could ease its monetary policy further if prices show a
decline,'' he said.
   The U.S. Federal Reserve Board lowered its federal fund rate, a
short-term interest rate, by 0.25 percentage points to 9.5 percent
on Wednesday.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
closed at 33,639.98, down 78.31 points or 0.23 percent. The index
had gained 91.40 points on Thursday.
   Yozo Asai of Yamaichi Securities, a major Japanese brokerage,
attributed the decline in the index to continuing uncertainty over
the situation in China and somewhat unstable exchange rates.
   ``With such factors, investors were unable to be positive,'' Asai
said.
   Volume traded on the market's first section was estimated at 500
million shares, down from Thursday's 650 million shares.

<HEAD>Activist Eighth-Grader Campaigns to Save ``Bloom County'' Comic Strip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTHBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An eighth-grader is petitioning Berke
Breathed to keep drawing his ``Bloom County'' comic strip, but the
cartoonist's editor says it's probably a lost cause.
   Breathed plans to substitute a Sunday-only strip for the daily
``Bloom County,'' which was introduced in December 1980 and in 1987
won a Pulitzer Prize.
   Al Leeds, who edits the strip for the Washington Post Writer's
Group, has already had a peek at the new cartoon, which he said is
being kept under wraps for now.
   But he revealed one secret: Opus isn't saying farewell after all.
   ``Opus the penguin will eventually appear in the new strip,''
Leeds promised. ``But he will only be a supporting character and
certainly not the protagonist.''
   Eric Gustafson, 13, has launched a grass-roots effort to convince
Breathed to keep alive Opus, along with Steve Dallas, Milo Bloom and
the rest of the strip's characters. And Gustafson isn't alone.
   ``The warmth of those characters was really something and it's
been an exceptional show of regret that Berke's ending it,'' said
Leeds, who signed Breathed to a contract in 1980 and watched the
strip spread to about 800 daily and college newspapers nationwide.
   Breathed's mail has more than doubled lately to as many as 250
letters a week, said Suzanne Whelton, an editorial assistant at the
Washington Post Writer's Group.
   ``There are some pretty distraught people out there,'' she said.
   Gustafson counts himself among them.
   ``I'm sure `Bloom County' has a lot of fans nationally who are
upset, so we're trying to get something started locally and hope it
will spread,'' said the Northboro Middle School student, who's so
far collected about 100 petition signatures.
   The cartoonist was out of the country and unavailable for comment
Thursday, but Leeds rated slim-to-none the chances Breathed would
reconsider his decision to terminate the comic strip.

   Elmer Elliott figures he's dying, but first he's
going to live it up.
   The 84-year-old, with weak hips, a bad heart and cancer, locked
up his apartment at a home for the elderly in Rockport, Maine, and
had an ambulance driver chauffeur him to Boston for his ``Last
Hurrah.''
   With six trunks and on money borrowed from a stepson, he's in
Boston this week to savor the scallops at Anthony's Pier Four, buy a
new vest at Brooks Brothers, hear Bo Winiker's Orchestra and wander
the Boston Common one last time.
   He also figures he's got enough time to dine at the Ritz Carlton,
browse at The Old Corner Bookstore and take in a few shows.
   Elliott made his plans after surviving a cancer operation last
winter. He didn't think he'd survive it.
   ``So when I did ... I decided to do whatever I can _ and this is
it,'' the clear-eyed retired businessman said Thursday, kicking back
a lunch-hour daiquiri.
   ``An appreciation of life is about the only reason I'm still
here,'' he said. ``People, music, literature, theater are what it's
been about.''
   It's also been about world tours, including cruises in
Antarctica, treks up Peru's Machu Picchu and leisurely dinners on
Paris' Left Bank.
   ``Anyone with common sense would recommend careful living,'' he
said. ``But I've got no common sense.''
   No common sense, maybe, but he pays heed to style. His thick,
silver hair has a straight part and his mustache is neatly trimmed.
He wore a pressed handkerchief in his breast pocket and a snazzy
silk tie.
   ``My stepson told me I had to cut out the hard living or I
wouldn't be around much longer,'' he said. ``That was 12 years ago.''
   Since then, he's criss-crossed the country, moving from Santa
Barbara, Calif., to Philadelphia, where his stepson is a philosophy
professor at Temple University.
   He's been married four times, divorced twice and widowed twice.
Elliott devoted his working days to negotiating missile contracts
with the U.S. government but retired to the finer things.
   Today he's inspired by a Joseph Campbell book on mythology he has
just picked up at a bookshop.
   ``I'm curious and that's taken me a long way,'' Elliott said.
``Some people are content to sit with worry beads ... but people,
places and things are my hobby.''
   And, he said, the fascination will never stop. He hasn't let
anything derail his plans.
   ``The world's gone to hell. It happened to Rome, to Greece and
now our civilization is starting to go downhill,'' he said,
accepting a second daiquiri from a waiter.
   ``So make the best of it while you can.''

<HEAD>Uzbek Mobs Growing More Aggressive, Death Toll 80</HEAD>

   Mobs in Soviet Uzbekistan are growing bolder,
escalating their attacks on police stations despite the presence of
thousands of soldiers, Izvestia reported today.
   The official government newspaper said the death toll from the
last six days of ethnic violence in the Fergana region of the
Central Asian republic was nearing 80, and more than 800 people have
been hurt.
   The region's party chief has called for ``more decisive
measures'' to stem the wave of arson and murder, Izvestia said
without identifying them.
   ``I think that, taking into account the serious nature of the
situation, we don't have enough force yet for its stabilization,''
Shavkat Yuldashev told the newspaper. ``Apparently, more decisive
measures are needed.''
   Alexi Yastrebov, a deputy to the Soviet Congress of People's
Deputies, said in an interview Thursday that the parliament was
asked by Communist Party officials in a closed session to approve
tougher action in Uzbekistan.
   A group of deputies, including some from Uzbekistan, were
scheduled to report on the latest developments to the Congress today
before a decision was taken.
   The government has brought in more than 9,000 Interior Ministry
soldiers, and given them the authority to open fire to protect
themselves, but held back on sending in regular army soldiers,
official media say.
   Reporting on recent attacks on police and the Interior Ministry
building in the troubled region's city of Kokand 1,500 miles
southeast of Moscow, the newspaper said a crowd of thousands managed
to seize three pistols and force police to release 12 detainees from
jail.
   ``The actions of the uncontrolled elements are becoming more
aggressive,'' Izvestia said. ``More and more often attacks are being
made on buildings of the Interior Ministry and police. The goal is
to sieze weapons. The population is extremely agitated.''
   Rioters have torched more than 550 houses and nearly 300
vehicles, and 300 people are now detained, it said.
   The killing started June 3 in a rampage between ethnic Uzbeks and
the Meskhi Turk minority, who were forcibly resettled in the Fergana
Valley of Uzbekistan by Josef Stalin in 1944.
   Yuldashev proposed ``addressing the problem of returning them to
their homeland'' in southern Georgia ``as quickly as possible.''
   More than 10,000 of the Meskhi Turks have been evacuated to the
safety of army camps. After the recent attacks on the police station
in Kokand, the mob invaded a Meskhi neighborhood and set more than
80 houses and six cars on fire, Izvestia reported.
   An Uzbek deputy who spoke at parliament this morning did not
comment directly on the violence, but he described harsh living
conditions in the cotton-growing southern republic.
   Adil Yakubov, head of the Uzbekistan Writers' Union, painted a
grim picture of the men and women laboring in the cotton fields
under hot sun and among poisonous chemicals.
   He compared workers in Uzbekistan's cotton fields to slaves
brought to America to work on plantations, but said the slaves were
better fed and their descendants now make up ``the best of American
sports and arts.''
   Uzbek children, he said, are so underfed they are often not
accepted into army combat units.
   Yakubov echoed claims by Uzbek activists that cotton production
imposed by Moscow has forced Uzbekistan to neglect feeding itself.
If cotton is so important,'' Yakubov complained, ``Why is our price
for cotton the lowest in the world?''
   Meanwhile, he said, the campaign to boost cotton production has
forced farms to poison the environment with chemical fertilizers and
pesticides. ``Our region is on the verge of ecological disaster,''
he said.
   The current violence began, according to Uzbek reports, with a
marketplace dispute over the price of strawberries that ignited
smouldering resentment among Uzbeks over what they see as
preferential treatment of the minority.

   Maybe it wasn't letter-perfect, but Michael
Joseph Tremboli's birth went by the numbers.
   When nurse Lorraine Ponsi looked up from the birthing table
Wednesday, 6-7-89, it was 1:23:45 p.m.
   ``I saw the head at 1:23 and 45 seconds later I saw the shoulder.
That's when the official birth time is,'' Ms. Ponsi said. ``When I
called it out to the nursing station, that's when we all realized
that the numbers ran concurrently.''
   The mother, Terry Tremboli of Eldersberg, said she would have
been relieved whenever her 12-hour labor ended. But she's convinced
the stars promise a bright future for her blue-eyed, 8-pound,
6-ounce baby boy.
   ``He can be anything he wants to be,'' she said Thursday in her
room at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. ``He's a real alert
baby already.''
   ``That kid is a wonderful child. He's got some wonderful
numbers,'' said Marie Allizon, a numerologist from Alexandria, Va.
``He will be good person, fun to be around and a good talker.
   ``Don't tell the mom, but he is going to be full of energy, and
that's hard on the parents. But when he's older, he'll turn that
into constructive energy. I see him being a spiritual leader, '' Ms.
Allizon said.
   At least two other children were born in the United States at
1:23:45 p.m.: Amber Lynn Pucelik in El Paso, Texas, also 8 pounds, 6
ounces; and Ansley Michelle Bradley in St. Louis, 9 pounds, 1 ounce.
   A child born on 6-7-89, said New York numerologist Sylvia
DiPietro, has the potential to overcome obstacles and become a
leader of industry. But much depends on circumstance and motivation.
   ``Take it from me,'' Ms. DiPietro said, ``I've met some very
famous people and they have very average numbers.''

   A jazz song by Bill Evans inspired Civilization.
   ``Whenever I heard it, I felt, `this is the way the world would
be if it were truly civilized,''' said the former Janet Carol
Hemingsen.
   The tune, ``I think it was called `Prelude,''' she said, inspired
her to change her name _ to Civilization _ Civil, to friends.
Hemingsen legally changed her name two years ago.
   ``I yearned to be in touch with myself and with the sense of
life,'' said Civilization, 43. ``Names come from ideas, not just
putting some letters together.
   ``There are so few things in this world to be happy about, you
should be happy with your name.''
   Stephen Peters was not happy with his, it seems, and after the
movie ``Star Wars'' came out in 1977, the Wayne Country assistant
prosecutor changed his name to Luke Skywalker.
   ``I changed my name because I liked the movie,'' said Skywalker.
``The main character did what he believed in.''
   Most name changes are rather ordinary, said Probate Judge Barry
Grant. ``It's mostly women taking back their maiden names, and names
that involve sex changes. Then you get the child who wants to take
back the family `root' name.
   ``The judge has complete discretion,'' Grant said. ``Unless it's
for evil purposes, it is granted.''
   Good Blessings Lesley Leslie Ann Trichio-Giammaria Thompson
Vetter Doe Trocchio has had her name changed five times since
September 1986.
   She did not show up at a hearing Wednesday to shorten her name to
Good Blessings Lesley-Leslie Ann Trochio.

<HEAD>June 18 Elections Set for 33 Rejected Communist Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new round of elections will be held June
18 for 33 lower house seats left open after voters rejected the
Communist leaders who were the sole candidates.
   Holding the new elections could smooth over the delicate
situation that resulted from the opposition Solidarity movement's
victory in the voting on Sunday for the current lower house, the
Sejm, and a new Senate.
   Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa met with government officials
to work out a solution, and the two sides agreed to hold the new
elections to fill 33 of the 35 seats reserved for Communist
Party-backed candidates. The Communists took a majority vote for
only two of the seats.
   Politburo member Janusz Reykowski said the elections would be
held a week from Sunday. He made the announcement late Thursday,
hours after official election returns showed the breadth of
Solidarity's victory in Poland's most open balloting in 42 years.
   In the voting for the new 100-seat Senate, Solidarity won 92
seats and the other eight were undecided. All seats in that chamber
were openly contested by opposition and Communist-backed candidates.
   Independent candidates were also allowed to run for 161 seats in
the 460-seat Sejm and won 160 of them. One will be decided in a
runoff.
   Of the remaining 299 seats in the Sejm, 264 were contested among
candidates from the Communist coalition. Because of the large number
of candidates, only three seats were won outright and the other 261
will be filled in the runoffs, also June 18.
   Reykowski said it was not known yet who would run for the seats.
   In his first comments since the balloting, Polish leader Gen.
Wojciech Jaruzelski was quoted as saying the party would be willing
to give up power completely if it loses the next elections in 1993,
which he said should be completely free.
   This year's election limited how many seats Solidarity could seek.
   ``I would like to see totally free elections because I think a
state of political solutions and social relations would make them
possible,'' the British daily The Independent quoted him as saying.
   Asked about party willingness to yield power if defeated, he was
quoted as saying, ``It is logical that if you talk about free
elections, one assumes any outcome is possible.''
   The Solidarity victory of almost all the seats in the newly
created Senate gives the opposition power to veto Sejm legislation,
and its representation in the Sejm can keep that body from mustering
the two-thirds necessary to override a veto.
   A joint communique Thursday night said Solidarity, ``realizing
the seriousness of the situation ... decided not to voice resistance
to the proposal made by the coalition government side.''
   The problem was delicate for Solidarity. It was concerned over
countering voters' will by seating the rejected officials, but it
saw strong political reasons to have senior Communist coalition
leaders participating in parliament.
   An agreement in April between Solidarity and the government said
299 seats of the 460-seat chamber would go to the governing
coalition and 161 would go to democratically elected independents.

   Fifty-seven inner-city children got a surprising
elementary school graduation gift: a guarantee of college if they
finish high school.
   Atlanta businessman John H. McDonald made the pledge at the
Minnie Howell Elementary School graduation Thursday night.
   In addition to the money involved, the children will get guidance
both in and out of the classroom, said Llewellyn Haden Jr., founder
of the Atlanta chapter of the I Have A Dream program.
   ``We want them to have a shot at life like others who have been
more fortunate,'' McDonald said.
   He would not disclose how much money was involved in the program,
but Haden said money is not the problem in sending the youngsters to
college.
   Thousands of dollars in national scholarships for inner-city,
black youths go unused each year, Haden said, and some of that money
can be used to supplement McDonald's sponsorship.
   What really counts is opening the horizons for children whose
surroundings of poverty and crime often discourage success, Haden
said.
   ``We get them involved culturally and involve them with different
people so they know what there is to dream about _ because they
can't dream about something if they don't know it exists,'' Haden
said.
   New York businessman Eugene Lang announced the creation of I Have
A Dream in a 1982 speech to P.S. 121, the Harlem school he attended
as a child.
   The program now operates in 26 cities nationwide and involves
about 6,000 students.
   The program hires a project coordinator to live in the targeted
students' neighborhoods and interact with them daily. They visit
colleges, attend cultural events and meet with people in different
occupations.
   ``These kids have zero self-confidence,'' Haden said. ``We have
to teach them things we simply take for granted _ public speaking,
manners, eating correctly, how to fill out a job application.''

   The U.S. dollar gained against European currencies
today in a nervous market.
   Gold was lower in cautious trading.
   Traders in Milan, Italy, said the dollar was caught between
contrary trends. Easing interest rates in the United States tended
to depress the currency, but turmoil in China encouraged the
traditional investor preference for the dollar as a safe haven.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.45 yen to a closing 143.50 yen, despite central
bank intervention in support of the yen. Later, in London, it was
quoted at 144.63.
   Other dollar rates at mid morning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.9860 Deutsche marks, up from 1.9770
   _1.7250 Swiss francs, up from 1.7100
   _6.7380 French francs, up from 6.7040
   _2.2270 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2220
   _1,447.00 Italian lire, up from 1,439.50
   _1.1950 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1967.
   In London, the dollar gained against the pound. It cost $1.5634
to buy a pound this morning, compared with $1.5735 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at $372.50 per ounce, down from $373.25
late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers
fixed a recommended price of $371.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $371.50, down from $374.35 late
Thursday.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at $372.53, down $4.08 from Wednesday's
close. Hong Kong markets were closed Thursday.
   Silver was quoted in London at $5.41 a troy ounce, from
Thursday's $5.44 dollars.

   Police today fired volleys of tear gas
to break up a protest by radical students demanding to go to
communist North Korea, and troopers raided a college to search for
pro-communist literature.
   Authorities said about 300 students were arrested.
   Police in armored vans fired tear gas when about 1,000 chanting
students tried to force their way past lines of riot police blocking
Yonsei University's main gate. Riot troopers kicked and punched
protesters.
   Students hurled rocks at the police, and there were reports of
minor injuries on both sides.
   The clash came after the government deployed about 20,000 riot
police to block protests by radical students demanding to take part
in the 13th World Youth Festival in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
   About 300 riot police in combat fatigues raided Sogang University
in western Seoul earlier today to confiscate posters and literature
on the festival to be held July 1-8. Police said firebombs were also
seized and two students arrested.
   Thousands of riot police were deployed around other campuses
where students held rallies to demand the right to take part in the
festival.
   Riot police stopped and searched many students outside campuses,
checking bags for firebombs and anti-government literature. Police
officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said about 300
students had been arrested in the spot checks.
   The government has banned plans for thousands of students to
assemble at Yonsei University during the weekend. The students have
asked North Korean representatives to come to Yonsei on Saturday for
talks, even though the Korean border is sealed.
   The government has said students will not be allowed to go to
North Korea to take part in the festival. The two Koreas are bitter
rivals who have clashed frequently over the years.
   North Korea has invited South Korean students to attend the youth
festival, an athletic and cultural festival attended mainly by
non-aligned and communist nations. South Korea has accused the north
of attempting to incite domestic unrest to weaken the Seoul
government.
   South Korean radical students and dissidents have been calling
for the fall of President Roh Tae-woo's government, but they lack
support because of their extremist views. The radicals have curbed
their normally violent protests since seven riot troopers were
killed in a clash May 3. Most recent protests have been peaceful.
   The government launched a crackdown on the radicals after the
troopers were killed. Many dissidents have been jailed and their
rallies blocked by major shows of police strength.

<HEAD>Comedian Sues for $50 Million Over Weight-loss Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weight-loss advocate Dick Gregory is suing
two companies for $50 million, saying they falsely took credit for
helping a man shed nearly a half-ton of fat.
   The former comedian's lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal District
Court here, said the companies ran a television commercial in which
Walter Hudson credited their product for helping him lose over 900
pounds.
   Hudson attracted Gregory's attention in September 1987 when his
estimated 1,200-pound bulk became wedged in a door frame. He had not
left the confines of his bedroom and bathroom for more than 15 years
and had not worn clothes in a decade.
   At the time, he weighed several hundred pounds more than the
person listed by the Guinness Book of World Records as the heaviest
living man.
   Gregory, who markets ``Dick Gregory's Slim-Safe Bahamian Diet
Nutritional Drink Mix,'' put Hudson on a rigorous diet, substituting
liquid for his breakfast of a dozen eggs and his dinner of two
chickens.
   Gregory set a target weight of 190 pounds, and Hudson lost 600 in
five months under constant supervision of Gregory's staff, the
lawsuit contends.
   After several months, Hudson went on his own diet after balking
when Gregory asked him to go to his clinic in the Bahamas.
   The suit does not name Hudson.
   ``I think those two companies just took advantage of him,''
Gregory said from Shreveport, La., where he was arrested Thursday
for picketing shops that sell drug paraphernalia. ``You have to
understand that hadn't been out of his house in 19 years.''
   The suit, filed by Dick Gregory Health Enterprises Inc. of
Chicago, names Media Arts International Ltd. of Arizona and Twin
Star Production Inc. of Delaware. It focuses on a 40-minute
commercial titled ``The Walter Hudson Story,'' which promotes the
``Optatrym Diet System'' that the companies market and distribute.
   The commercial features a talk-show format with Hudson saying
that ``once I started with this system, then a complete turnabout''
occurred. An announcer calls Optatrym ``the weight loss system that
helped Walter lose over 900 pounds of fat,'' the lawsuit says.
   Gregory also requested a preliminary injunction stopping the
advertisements, which run on secondary television stations.
   The commercial never mentions Gregory's products, according to
the suit, although Gregory said his product can be seen in the
background.
   Hudson's attorney, Philip Asbury, said he has represented his
client for only a month and did not know about the lawsuit. He said
he was unable to reach Hudson for comment.
   Calls to the two companies weren't answered Thursday.
   Gregory and two ministers who were protesting with him in
Shreveport were released after being booked on misdemeanor charges
of refusing to leave a place of business and blocking a public
passageway.

   A modified water wheel that one

   The water-power device installed at Whetstone Brook in Wendell,
Mass., by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service provides a steady
dribble of basic lime to buffer the stream's acidity.
   The doser is the first of its type to go into operation in a $2.5
million state and federal research project.
   A similar machine is going ``on stream'' in Tennessee and a
slightly different machine that grinds up limestone before dumping
the residue in the water has been treating a West Virginia stream
since December, said Kent Schreiber, who heads the program.
   The agency is also working with Minnesota officials on liming a
lake and with New York on treating a wild watershed in the
Adirondacks by using aircraft to dump powdered lime on the forest
floor, he said.
   Trout and other stream life are particularily vulnerable because
heavy rains or runoff from melting snow can raise a stream's acidity
sharply within a few hours, Schreiber said.
   The water wheels on the devices are geared to automatically
increase the dosages of limestone required as the stream flow rises.
``One of the pleasant side effects we've found is some of the
limestone settles into the sediment where it can have a
longer-lasting effect,'' he said.
   ``Obviously, because of the amount of limestone involved, this
isn't the sort of thing that can be done to every stream. But the
aim of our project is to see what can be done and the effects on the
water and the fish and invertebrates in a variety of situations.''
   Treating the isolated 30-foot wide, one-foot deep Whetstone Brook
will require about 60 tons of powdered limestone a year, Simmons
said. About 24 tons of the chemicals are stored in two 15-foot silos
built along the stream with the help of volunteers from the local
chapter of Trout Unlimited.
   ``So far, we've found it's worked surprisingly well,'' said
Simmons. ``Although we have also found that powdered limestone cake
is one of the most difficult things to work with, particularily in
hot, humid weather.''
   The machine was almost swamped during May's record rains, he
said, but kept pH levels at a nearly neutral 6.5. During the storms,
the pH of untreated water upstream fell to 5, a level that threatens
trout, he said.

<HEAD>Judge Bans Battling Coaches From Little League</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENA, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's decision for two Little League
coaches who brawled after a game was befitting of an umpire: You're
outta here.
   Municipal Court Judge Michael Mazzoni on Wednesday barred the two
coaches from all Little League activities for the rest of the season.
   The dispute in the south New Jersey town started in April when
one coach, Anthony Stratton, wanted a player to sell candy to raise
money for the team. The boy's uncle, Gregory Gruver, a coach for
another team, objected because another boy in the family also was
trying to sell candy for the league.
   What started as an argument ended up in a brawl one night after a
game. The two fought until they fell into a parked van and caused
almost $800 in damage, police said.
   Mazzoni ordered Gruver, 32, and Stratton, 36, to each pay a $100
fine, $25 in court fees, $30 for violent crimes compensation and
$384 in restoration fees.
   The judge also ordered each man to perform 30 hours of community
service _ but not as coaches.
   ``We have to show the kids that you don't go out and have fights
after a ball game,'' Mazzoni said.

   Soviet pilot Anatoly Kvochur, injured when he
ejected from his MiG-29 fighter jet just before it crashed at the
Paris Air Show, was released today from a military hospital, the
Soviet Embassy said.
   Kvochur, 37, was conscious and talking when he was airlifted to
Begin Military Hospital with stomach injuries minutes after his jet
exploded Thursday in front of hundreds of reporters, exhibitors and
visitors at the air show at Le Bourget airport.
   An embassy official said Kvochur was well enough to leave the
hospital, and might even visit the air show. He had no further
information about the pilot's condition.
   Kvochur, described by a Soviet official as one of their best
pilots, was making a low-level pass in front of spectators when the
afterburners on the single-seat fighter jet failed to ignite.
   The plane stalled at about 1,000 feet and plunged to the ground
just off the airfield's central runway, away from the spectators.
   The air show was inaugurated Thursday by President Francois
Mitterrand, and opened to the public today.
   The Soviet presence at the show, held every two years, is its
strongest yet, with 12 of their most sophisticated planes on
display. The MiG-29 was making its second appearance in the West.
Kvochur flew it at the Farnborough Air Show in England last year.
   Soviet officials at the show announced their planes would
continue their schedule of demostration flights, despite the loss of
the MiG.

<HEAD>EEC to Ban Ivory Imports, Support Endangered Elephants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community decided today
to ban ivory imports from Africa and support international efforts
to protect the elephants from extinction.
   The 12 EEC environment ministers, who had been pressed by Britain
to discuss the problem, said the ban was necessary because the
remaining African elephants were being decimated by hunters that
covet their ivory tusks.
   The EEC is estimated to account for some 20 percent of world
demand of ivory, which has become more expensive as supplies
worldwide have diminished. Asians in particular form a large market
for ivory.
   The ministers instructed the executive EEC Commission to draft
measures to enforce the ban, which will then become effective
immediately throughout the Common Market.
   A European official, who asked not to be named, said the
Commission proposals could be made at the next meeting of EEC
environment ministers, possibly next month.
   Meanwhile, individual member countries were asked to take urgent
measures to ban all imports of ivory, either raw or transformed for
jewelry or other uses.
   The 12 environment ministers also decided to have African
elephants listed among animals threatened with extinction at the
next international conference on animal protection in October.
   The European Commission was instructed to make proposals to that
effect.

<HEAD>President Rules Out Midterm Referendum, Will Run Full Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo has decided not
to hold a promised midterm referendum on his administration and will
complete his full five-year term, the head of the governing party
said today.
   Park Jyun-kyu, chairman of the Democratic Justice Party, also
told The Associated Press in an interview that the gradual
withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea could begin in 1992 if
the Seoul government is confident it can defend itself against
communist North Korea.
   Park said Roh had ruled out any vote of confidence because such
balloting could create political unrest. Roh has yet to make an
official announcement on the referendum.
   ``We're excluding any possibility of a national referendum (on
Roh),'' Park said. ``The president is going to perform his duties up
to the last day of his term. We feel that's what the majority of the
people want.''
   Roh had promised before presidential elections in December 1987
to hold a referendum on his performance after the September 1988
Olympic Games in Seoul. Roh, a former general, won the elections
after rival opposition leaders split the opposition vote.
   Roh postponed a referendum in March, saying it threatened to
create a major political confrontation. Some opposition leaders had
said Roh would have to resign if he lost the referendum.
   Park said the government was not ruling out national referendums
on major issues, but there would be no vote that would require Roh
to resign if the administration lost. He said opinion polls clearly
showed public sentiment was against a referendum.
   Park also said public opposition to anti-government dissidents
was growing and the dissidents were losing strength. He said the
government had cracked down on dissidents because they posed a
violent threat to the government and the public had to be reassured.
   Police today used tear gas to break up a protest by radical
students demanding to go to North Korea, and troopers raided a Seoul
college to search for pro-communist literature. Three hundred
students were reported arrested.
   On foreign affairs, Park said he did not see much hope for a
quick end to the bitter confrontation with communist North Korea. He
said a recent South Korean drive to improve relations failed to make
substantial progress.
   ``We were too unrealistic,'' he said.
   Park also expressed concern that recent unrest in China may
prompt North Korea's totalitarian government to enforce its rule and
block liberalization. The one hope for improving relations was the
North's growing economic crisis and its desperate need for aid from
South Korea and other nations, he said.
   The Korean peninsula has been divided since 1945 and the North
invaded the South in 1950 to start the Korean War.
   Park said he favors a long-term U.S. military presence in the
South, but gradual withdrawal could begin from 1992 if Seoul is
confident it can defend itself against the North. Some dissidents
have called for expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in the
South.
   The party chairman also said South Korea has to end political
quarreling over the legacy of the authoritarian regime of former
President Chun Doo-hwan. Chun, a former general who took power with
military backing in 1980, stepped down in 1988 at the end of his
term and is now living in rural exile.
   Opposition parties have been demanding Chun atone for
human-rights abuses and corruption under his rule. Park said Chun
was responsibile for any abuses under his government and Roh could
not be blamed, even though he was one of Chun's closest associates
and his chosen successor.
   Park said he did not know how the dispute, which has dominated
domestic politics, could be settled since the opposition appeared
determined to punish Chun. ``They want to see some suffering,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Uno Prodded in Parliament on Geisha Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno today refused to respond
as a questioner in Parliament broke precedent by asking him about a
news report claiming he kept a highly paid geisha as his mistress.
   Uno, who previously denied the report to journalists, said he
would not comment on it in a public forum.
   The report surfaced last weekend in the Sunday Mainichi magazine,
which broke with Japanese journalism tradition by publishing or
broadcasting reports on such liaisons by government officials.
   The magazine's story was not picked up at first by major
newspapers or national television. But the question on the issue in
the upper house of the Diet, Japan's parliament, was reported by
Kyodo News Service and on the evening television news by Japan
Broadcasting Corp.
   Socialist Manae Kubota, an activist on women's rights, posed Uno
a three-pronged question: why were there no women in the Cabinet he
formed last Friday; what did he think about prostitution; and
because the Washington Post had published an article on the
allegation that he had kept a geisha mistress, ``if it's not true,
you should clearly protest.''
   Uno replied only: ``I will refrain from commenting publicly on
such a kind of report concerning myself.''
   Miss Kubota later told The Associated Press she brought up the
question because she thought the geisha story reflected badly on the
prime minister's integrity and Japan's image.
   ``It is true that an affair of that sort is often tolerated in
Japanese society. However, I firmly believe the prime minister
should quit if the scandal was true,'' she said.
   Uno, 66, took office a week ago in the midst of a bribery scandal
that forced the resignation of his predecessor, Noboru Takeshita.
   Uno's main qualifications were that he was believed free of
scandal and that his experience as foreign minister would serve
Japan well at a time of trade tensions and during the summit this
summer of the seven industralized democracies.
   But he is not regarded as a strong politician, and some analysts
doubt he will last more than a few months as his long-governing
Liberal Democratic Party sorts itself out in the wake of the Recruit
bribery scandal.
   Miss Kubota said she felt Uno may not be fit to represent Japan
abroad. ``Buying prostitutes isn't tolerated in international
society,'' she said.
   The Sunday Mainichi article quoted an unidentified 40-year-old
woman as saying Uno had paid her $2,100 a month over a four-month
period in 1985.
   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' the article quoted the
woman as saying. ``I don't want him to use politics the same way he
treated me.''
   Geishas are women highly trained in music, dance and making
conversation. While they are not prostitutes, some develop intimate
relationships with customers who become their patrons, and in Japan
it has long been considered not unusual for wealthy and powerful men
to have such relations.
   Uno, however, denied the liaison when asked by reporters early
this week.
   Gregory Clark, professor of Japan studies at Sophia University,
said it may have been the first time a prime minister was asked
directly about such a relationship in the Diet.
   Clark thought the issue has arisen in Japan partly because of a
descent to what he called ``gutter journalism.''
   But Shuntaro Torigoe, editor in chief of the Sunday Mainichi,
said he published the article because he wanted to bring issues of
social ethics into the public arena.
   ``We also want Americans, who are critical of politicians, to
know that in Japan we are changing,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha today
extended the national state of emergency for a fourth year in a bid
to quell further black unrest and maintain a clampdown on opposition
political groups.
   Despite a sharp decline in political violence during the past
year, Botha said black revolutionaries are still plotting to
undermine his white-led government.
   ``By applying the emergency measures, the government succeeded in
stopping the widespread violence by radicals,'' Botha said.
   However, Botha said in his statement that revolutionaries are
``continuing underground to mobilize and to exert their influence''
and ``unrest-related violence is still unacceptably high.''
   Anti-apartheid groups said Botha's decision would further
polarize the deeply divided country.
   ``The apartheid policy is so acutely unacceptable to the majority
of the people of South Africa that apartheid government can be
maintained only by force,'' said Zach de Beer, the white leader of
the anti-apartheid Democratic Party.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   ``The reimposition of the emergency will be a recipe for
conflict,'' the mostly black Congress of South African Trade Unions,
the country's largest labor federation, said in a statement.
   The government proclamation formally extending the emergency made
no changes to the existing regulations. The wide-ranging
restrictions make it illegal to call for boycotts or foreign
sanctions, to seek to undermine the security forces, or to report on
police activity or unrest without permission. Most forms of peaceful
protest also are banned.
   A senior police official, Gen. Johan van der Merwe, told a news
briefing that all 32 organizations banned the past three years would
remain restricted.
   He also said restrictions including house arrest, prohibitions on
the right to work, speak publicly, participate in political
activity, or travel would be reimposed on about 500 people.
   About 30,000 people, almost all of them black, have been detained
without charge for varying lengths of time during the emergency,
although fewer than 100 currently are being held now.
   After a hunger strike among detainees this year, hundreds were
freed but restrictions were placed on their activities.
   Van der Merwe said one of the main reasons for continuing the
state of emergency was ``indications'' the September parliamentary
elections would be the target of ``terrorist actions.'' Parliament
has chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixed race but no
representation for the black majority.
   F.W. de Klerk, leader of the governing National Party and Botha's
designated successor, said he supported the renewal of the state of
emergency. The National Party is viewed as virtually certain to win
the September elections, and Botha has indicated he will step down
at that time.
   When he imposed the national state of emergency on June 12, 1986,
Botha said the normal law of the land was inadequate to maintain
order at a time when protests, mob violence, clashes between police
and black township residents spread across the country.
   The violence, which took at least 3,000 lives, almost all black,
has dropped dramatically.
   The only major ongoing conflict is in the townships around Durban
and Pietermaritzburg, two southeastern cities where rival black
groups are locked in a bitter power struggle.
   Elsewhere today, a limpet mine exploded at a deserted muncipal
office building in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.
It was the 24th bombing this year, but no one has been killed in any
of the attacks.
   There have been nearly 200 bombings, injuring 680 people and
killing 35, during the state of emergency.

<HEAD>South African Clergyman Says He May Have Been Poisoned by Pesticides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black South African clergyman who says he
may have been poisoned by pesticides on his luggage wants South
African officials to determine whether someone tampered with his
baggage or clothing.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the South African
Council of Churches, has been hospitalized five times since April
for a nerve illness.
   He was hospitalized four times last month in Madison while
visiting his wife, Kagiso, who is a student in African linguistics
at the University of Wisconsin. Each time he was released after a
few days.
   Chikane, 38, told reporters Thursday that the illness forced him
to skip a meeting May 18 with President Bush to discuss apartheid.
Chikane said he was in the United States as part of a council
delegation that included Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu.
   If his luggage was contaminated, he said, he could not speculate
whether it was accidental or deliberate. ``I do not remember being
near any farming area or near any war zone where such chemicals
could be in use,'' he said.
   Chikane said his first bout of illness came when he was traveling
to Namibia on April 23, where he was hospitalized briefly, and that
he seemed to be stricken whenever he came in contact with his
luggage or its contents.
   ``I believe it will be to everyone's interest that this matter be
thoroughly investigated back at home to clear up any uncertainties,
suspicions and even speculations relating to this matter,'' Chikane
said.
   Chikane was hospitalized on four separate occasions from May 12
to May 27 at University of Wisconsin Hospitals. Dr. Daniel J. Smith
said the only common denominator of the four instances was that
Chikane was living out of a suitcase.
   Hospital officials said his symptoms were similar to those from
exposure to chemicals in pesticides but that the cause was not
identified. Smith said the chemical might have been organophosphate
anticholinesterase, but that more tests were required before anyone
could be certain. Organophosphates are commonly used in pesticides.
   ``In all cases, I felt nauseous, I started sweating, salivating
and vomited,'' Chikane said. ``My body started shaking and
twitching. My eyes became watery and my vision blurred. I could
hardly walk or turn my body in a sleeping position.''

   Two babies died in a fire in a
day-care center, despite the efforts of a passer-by who sprayed
water on a burning door and another who pulled out dolls he thought
were children.
   ``Even the firemen when they came out started crying after seeing
those babies,'' said Dennis Drew, who had desperately aimed water at
the front door until firefighters arrived at Thursday morning's
blaze.
   The fire gutted the home, a licensed day care center, killing
Jessica Jordan of Huntington Beach, who would have been 8 months old
today, and John H. Reilly IV, about 13 months old, said Fire
Department spokeswoman Martha Werth.
   One passer-by, Bill Appleby, soaked himself with water and tried
to search a room at the back of the smoke-filled home, officials
said.
   ``He's grabbing anything that resembles a child,'' said Fire
Chief Bill Cooper. ``He would run in and come out a couple of times,
and he was retrieving stuffed animals and dolls.''
   ``He was our only child,'' said John H. Reilly III, father of the
13-month-old. ``I can't believe it happened. How can something like
this happen so quickly?''
   Witnesses said the 49-year-old baby sitter, Pat Orozco, dashed
out of the home with an 6-month-old boy in her arms and a 3-year-old
boy at her side. She and the younger boy were hospitalized, while
the 3-year-old was treated and released.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, but a faulty
television was suspected, officials said.

<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with meeting ending, agreement to increase

<TEXT>
   The NATO allies agreed today to retain
their goal of boosting annual defense budgets by 3 percent, even
though they are pushing for deep military cuts at talks with the
Soviet bloc.
   In a statement at the end of a two-day strategy session, defense
ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization acknowledged
that many allies, including the United States, have failed to
achieve the 3 percent growth rate in real terms because of economic
pressures.
   However, they said that target must remain in place to secure
strong defenses as long as the East-West talks in Vienna on
conventional force cuts in Europe have not yielded an accord.
   ``To sustain a credible deterrent, there remains, at least for
the time being, a continuing need to increase (defense spending) to
redress existing deficiencies in conventional defense,'' the
statement said.
   ``There was broad agreement that sound defenses are constantly
kept up to date,'' NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner told
reporters after the meeting, saying the Warsaw Pact retained a
2-to-1 superiority over NATO in conventional forces. ``To reduce our
defense efforts in such a situation would be unwise,'' he said.
   The ministers also discussed President Bush's proposal to remove
30,000 U.S. troops and 325,000 Soviet soldiers from Europe and to
reduce the number of NATO combat aircraft by 750 and Warsaw Pact
planes by 3,000. Bush said such reductions would bring the two sides
to equal strength in those areas.
   Bush's offer followed several announcements of proposed cuts and
unilateral reductions by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. In
December, Gorbachev said 50,000 Red Army troops would be withdrawn
from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary by the end of 1990. He
has also announced removal of 500 short-range nuclear arms from
Europe.
   Of Bush's proposed 15 percent cut in combat aircraft, U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said, ``We are confident that we can
make those adjustments.'' He said these cuts can be made in NATO air
forces without scrapping British and French nuclear-capable aircraft.
   Cheney said he told the allies the proposals exclude 72 F-16
jetfighters to be moved from Torrejon Air Base near Madrid, Spain,
to southern Italy. The planes must be restationed because Spain
ended a basing accord with the United States.
   Officials said the proposed cuts in aircraft would leave
16-member NATO and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact each with about
4,600 combat aircraft in Europe.
   Bush proposed at last week's NATO summit that the East and West
agree within a year on these cuts and others already proposed for
tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces. The Vienna
talks began earlier this year.
   NATO's 3 percent growth target is a long-standing but elusive
goal. In December, the alliance issued a lengthy report pinpointing
nations that fail to maintain even minimum defenses.
   Even so, Cheney said that while most countries do not meet the
target, it remains ``an objective we would like to pursue.''
   He said economic pressures forced him to slice $10 billion from
the Pentagon budget. He said the reductions include closing 86
military bases in the United States, but none overseas.

   The wife of the man authorities say is
18-year fugitive John E. List says she doesn't believe her husband
is the man wanted in the 1971 slayings of his first wife, mother,
and three children.
   Delores Clark, 50, told a news conference Thursday that she has
seen her husband in jail but she didn't discussed the case with him.
   Robert P. Clark was arrested June 1 on a federal fugitive warrant
and is being held in the Henrico County Jail awaiting proceedings to
extradite him to Union County, N.J., where the slayings occurred.
   In a brief hearing yesterday, U.S. Magistrate David G. Lowe
authorized federal officials to release Clark into Virginia custody
pending extradition. Later Thursday, a county judge set a hearing
for July 6 and ordered him held without bail.
   His attorney, David Baugh, said his client will not waive his
right to an extradition hearing.
   ``The Commonwealth will have to prove every element,'' Baugh
said. ``We're not going to acquiesce on anything.''
   Mrs. Clark said she has never suspected her husband, even when a
neighbor once showed her an article about the List case accompanied
by a picture of the suspect that resembled Clark.
   Mrs. Clark said she never showed that article to her husband.
   ``I dismissed it because I thought it was not true,'' she said.
``It's still not true.''
   Mrs. Clark, 50, said she called the news conference to get
reporters to stop calling her and her family.
   ``My brother has multiple sclerosis. My mother is 80 years old,''
she said, her voice breaking. ``She is not a strong lady and I don't
need this for my family.''
   Mrs. Clark said she met her husband in 1977, eight years before
they were married.
   ``I have never known Robert to be anything but a sweet and gentle
man of good character,'' she said. ``We have had a happy marriage
filled with mutual respect and love.''
   Clark told her his first wife had died, Mrs. Clark said.
   ``What he did was tell me that his wife had cancer and she was a
very sickly lady,'' she said.
   When asked about her husband's fingerprints and scars, which
authorities say match List's identifying marks, Mrs. Clark said
only, ``I don't know.''
   ``I love my husband very deeply,'' she said. ``I do not believe
this is the same man.''

<HEAD>Police Allegedly Trailed Woman Who Filed Paternity Suit Against Young</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A police undercover unit sought information about
a woman's relationships with other men after she filed a paternity
suit against Mayor Coleman A. Young, a newspaper reported today.
   Young and Police Chief William Hart denied knowledge of the
investigation. But Detroit Free Press quoted police sources as
saying that the unit was seeking information that could be used in
case Annivory Calvert's suit against Young went to trial.
   Calvert, 34, a former assistant director of the city Department
of Public Works, filed the lawsuit Jan. 27, alleging that Young
fathered her son in 1982. The suit was filed shortly before Calvert
moved to Fontana, Calif., where she directs the Department of Public
Works.
   Calvert's lawsuit, which seeks child support and an
acknowledgement by Young that he fathered the child, is pending in
Wayne County Circuit Court. Three separate tests conducted last
month virtually proved that Young, 71, is the child's father and
diminished the likelihood of a trial.
   Lawyers for Calvert and Young have been negotiating child support.
   Michael Thomas, a city employee and a former friend of Calvert's,
said police questioned him in February about Calvert's dating habits
and whether she had had sex with any of her dates.
   Thomas said he was interviewed by an officer named Dan Hart, whom
the newspaper identified as the commanding officer of a special
investigative unit attached to the chief's staff. Chief William
Hart, who is not related to the inspector, said the unit
investigates ``sensitive'' matters involving Detroit employees.
   ``What this does is substantiate why I couldn't have filed this
suit and stayed in Detroit,'' Calvert said.

<HEAD>Parliament Speaker Says Khamenei Qualified to Rule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NEIL MacFARQUHAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said
today that President Ali Khamenei is qualified to be Iran's supreme
leader, even if it means bending the constitution, the official news
agency reported.
   Rafsanjani said Khamenei meets conditions outlined in April by
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for his successor and that
settling the issue quickly has stunned the world, the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
   Khamenei, 49, was selected to succeed Khomeini as supreme leader
Sunday by the 80-member Assembly of Experts, chosen by Khomeini in
the early days of the revolution to determine his succession. The
appointment intially was reported as temporary, but Rafsanjani said
Thursday it is permanent.
   Iranian news reports have started calling Khamenei an ayatollah,
a title reserved for the highest religious leaders, even though he
is only a middle-ranking cleric. Khamenei's second term as president
expires in October and the constitution bars him from running again.
Rafsanjani, 55, is the only candidate running in the Aug. 18
presidential election.
   Rafsanjani, speaking at Friday prayers in Tehran, made his second
public remarks in as many days concerning leadership posts,
apparently working to consolidate positions of power for the more
moderate faction he leads.
   Although Khomeini did not name a direct successor, Rafsanjani
said, the late revolutionary patriarch had hinted that Khamenei was
qualified.
   Rafsanjani read from an April 29 letter he said Khomeini wrote to
a constitutional review committee.
   He said Khomeini, who died of a heart attack Saturday at age 86,
wrote that his successor need not be a marja', or supreme religious
leader, although that is stipulated in the constitution.
   Rafsanjani quoted the letter as saying:
   ``From the start I believed and insisted that it was not
necessary to be a marja' to qualify. A just mujtahid (skilled
jurist) who is confirmed by the honorable experts from throughout
the country would be sufficient.''
   The parliament speaker, who also is acting commander of the armed
forces, said Khomeini gave permission many times for officials to
overlook the Constitution.
   ``We all accept that leadership is above the constitution,'' he
said.
   Rafsanjani, himself a middle-ranking cleric, said experience in
executive positions is more important than strict theological
training. He asked who was more qualified to run the country: ``He
who is more skilled in social, economic, cultural and political
issues _ the basic issues of state _ or he who is in the theological
school?''
   The world had not expected such a swift transition, he said.
   ``The important thing is that with this swift (selection) we have
stunned the world,'' IRNA quoted him as saying. ``It at once
canceled all this propaganda about a power struggle and differences
and divisions among radicals and moderates and this and that
faction.''

<HEAD>Increase in Number of Mumps Cases Easing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A surge in mumps cases in recent years may be
easing, but mumps victims tend to be older than they once were, the
federal Centers for Disease Control reported.
   Preliminary figures from the CDC show reported mumps cases
dropped to 4,730 last year after 7,790 cases in 1986 and 12,848 in
1987.
   Mumps cases in the United States plunged after 1967 when the live
mumps virus vaccine was introduced and reached a record low 2,982
cases in 1985, a 98 percent drop from 1967, the CDC said Thursday.
   But the report said mumps victims tend to be older than they
were. It said a third of the cases from 1985-1987 affected people
age 15 or older. The same age group recorded only 8 percent of the
cases between 1967 and 1971, the first five years after the vaccine
was licensed.
   Mumps can be more severe in adults than in children _
particularly for men, who are occasionally made sterile by the
disease. Symptoms include pain and swelling in the salivary glands
and throat.
   The CDC report said that people who got mumps during the 1986-87
surge tended to be born between 1967 and 1977 when there was
underimmunization. Immunization did not reach the 50 percent level
of any age group until 1976.
   The study said the surge in mumps cases was largely due to a
failure to vaccinate, not a failure of the vaccine, which is about
95 percent effective.
   The report said the lowest incidence of mumps was in the District
of Columbia and 14 states where schools require proof of immunity
from kindergarten through 12th grade.

   About 50,000 students and supporters staged a
peaceful demonstration in Shanghai today to mourn the deaths of six
people killed in recent anti-government disturbances in the city.
   Three provincial capitals also reported arrests today as cities
across China were wracked by protests against the martial law
crackdown in Beijing.
   The Shanghai demonstrators gathered through the day in People's
Square to conduct funeral rites for the six, who were killed Tuesday
night when a train crashed through a barricade set up on tracks near
Shanghai station.
   Angry crowds then set fire to the train and fought with
firefighters and police who came to put it out, injuring more than
20.
   Crowds in China's largest city have set up barricades on train
tracks and street corners to protest the military takeover of
Beijing and stop troops from entering Shanghai. Most barricades were
down by Friday.
   The national television news also showed large areas of burned
out buildings in the Sichuan capital of Chengdu that it said were
attacked by mobs during street protests on Monday. It also broadcast
scenes of protests in Shanghai, Changsha, Wuhan and Harbin and
showed dozens of people being arrested for alleged destructive acts.
   About 100 people were arrested after the rioting in Chengdu, and
arrests also have been reported in Canton, Beijing and other cities.
   Local radio in the southern city of Guiyang said 24 people were
arrested after a fracas in which crowds threw stones and bottles at
buses, commandeered them, destroyed a police motorcycle and smashed
shop windows and counters.
   It said the crowds damaged 11 cars and stole money and goods
during the incident Wednesday night.
   In the western city of Lanzhou, 19 people were detained Thursday
after a group destroyed traffic installations, stopped vehicles and
erected barricades, the provincial radio said. It said police
confiscated daggers, steel pipes, iron chains and other weapons.
   In Zhengzhou, central China, police arrested ``thugs'' who
Thursday night damaged street installations and overturned a
vehicle. Some protesters were detained, but the number was not known.
   The radio reports, monitored by the British Broadcasting Co., all
said no university students were arrested.
   Unlike the generally peaceful demonstrations in many cities
before the military crackdown in Beijing June 3 and 4, the
protesters have been increasingly confrontational and violent.
   Protesters in Xian paralyzed traffic by setting up roadblocks
throughout the city, and people in Changsha stopped trains with
sit-ins on tracks.
   Provincial leaders throughout the country have warned of anarchy
and called for harsh suppression of the anti-government protesters.

<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 3 grafs after 7th graf, Power plants, to add EPA data
on toxic pollutants</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush says the environment is ``a
moral issue'' and he is promising to send Congress new clean air
standards that will ``significantly improve every North American's
quality of life.''
   The president heard conflicting advice Thursday from
industrialists and environmentalists on how to grapple with the
issue.
   Both sides said the president didn't tip his hand and assured
them he had not yet made final decisions.
   Administration aides, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said, however, that Bush had already decided on many key parts of
the legislation _ including tough new standards for cleaning up
smokestack emissions that cause acid rain.
   The industrialists warned the president against standards so
stringent they hurt the economy. The environmentalists said Bush was
``shocked'' to hear that his resort home town of Kennebunkport,
Maine, had dangerously high ozone levels last summer.
   Administration sources said the president also has decided on
far-reaching, rigid new standards to prevent chemical contamination
of the air, extending to hundreds of businesses from paint factories
to bakeries.
   Power plants and other industries that burn coal in the Midwest,
many of which disperse their pollutants through tall smokestacks
without technological controls, will be a key target of Bush's
clean-air attack, the sources said.
   Meanwhile Thursday, a congressman released survey data compiled
by the Environmental Protection Agency that found more than 200
plants emitting toxic air pollutants at levels far above federal
standards.
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment, said, ``We
ignore these data at our peril.'' He added that the threat of cancer
from plant emissions was ``much more widespread'' than commonly
thought.
   But EPA officials said the survey findings were preliminary,
out-of-date and not yet refined enough to calculate the impact on
public health.
   Bush, in a luncheon speech to Ducks Unlimited, a hunters'
conservation group, said that on Monday he will unveil ``the most
sweeping changes to the Clean Air Act since it was last amended 12
years ago.''
   ``It will significantly improve every North American's quality of
life,'' said the president.
   He said preventing pollution is far more efficient ``than
struggling to deal with problems once they've occurred.''
   ``For too long, we've focused on cleanup and penalties after the
damage is done,'' he said. ``In the 1990s, pollution prevention will
go right to the source.''
   At the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
said Bush already ``deserves credit'' for paying attention to the
environment.
   ``He has wholly reversed the position of the Reagan
administration on this subject,'' Mitchell told reporters. During
the Reagan years, ``the biggest obstacle (to environmental cleanup
legislation) was the executive branch.''
   Bush, who portrayed himself in last year's campaign as a lifelong
environmentalist in the Teddy Roosevelt tradition, brought the
industrialists and environmentalists into the Roosevelt Room in
separate shifts.
   William D. Fay, administrator of the Clean Air Working Group, a
business coalition, said, ``The bills that we've seen before
Congress could have a potentially dramatic impact on jobs, on our
competitiveness.''
   ``We urged him to make certain that, when the dust settles on
clean air, that we have a healthy economy left,'' said Fay.
   Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors, said the
industrialists ``asked the president for a flexible solution that
would be cost-effective.''
   Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club, said Bush
assured environmentalists that ``the deck is not stacked.''
   Ruth Caplan, executive director of Environmental Action, said,
``He was shocked to know that last summer (in Kennebunkport) there
were many days in which there were serious health problems from
ozone smog.''
   ``I think he is very concerned about clean air,'' she said.
   The environmentalists want action not only on acid raid ``but
also on air toxics and on ozone-smog,'' said Caplan.
   Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund,
said, ``We told him that the key was going to be whether he comes up
with an acid rain bill that gets 12 million tons (of sulfur dioxide
emissions) out of the air.''

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union's main spokesman said
today the Kremlin was surprised by China's crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators and that Soviet officials have been
unable to reach Beijing.
   ``We can't get through, either,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov said in an interview.
   He said Soviet officials were surprised at the means with which
Chinese communist leaders suppressed student demonstrators who had
been rallying peacefully for weeks in support of broader reforms.
   Asked if he was surprised by the brutality of the crackdown on
the Chinese protests, Gerasimov said: ``We hadn't expected this.''
He said Soviet authorities were ``extremely dismayed'' at Beijing's
actions.
   The spokesman's comments are the first official Soviet response
since the new Soviet Congress issued an extremely guarded statement
Tuesday saying events in China were ``an internal affair.''
   Gerasimov indicated that he and other Soviet officials who
traveled to Beijing last month for the first Sino-Soviet summit in
30 years were aware of the massive student demonstrations, which
occurred during the visit, but avoided focusing their talks on
China's domestic unrest because of protocol.
   Asked whether senior Kremlin officials have let Beijing leaders
know of their concern over the military crackdown, Gerasimov said
telephone contact with Beijing, the Chinese capital, had been
impossible since Chinese troops cleared students from Tiananmen
Square on June 3 and 4.
   Hundreds if not thousands of protesters were reported killed by
troops acting on orders from Chinese hard-liners led by conservative
Premier Li Peng.
   Gerasimov and numerous other Soviet officials are in Bonn to
prepare for next week's visit by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.

<TEXT>
   NATO ambassadors today proposed an
unprecedented exchange of information among East, West and neutral
nations about military forces in Europe, the world's most heavily
armed continent.
   The proposal, made at talks between 35 nations on building
confidence on European security, calls for a data bank that would
make available details on armed forces and weapons deployment, arms
procurement and other matters.
   It is one of a series of suggestions presented by the Netherlands
on behalf of NATO at a closed session of the conference, attended by
the United States and Canada, the Soviet Union and all European
nations except Albania.
   They are discussing confidence and security-building measures to
verify and enhance agreements reached at parallel Vienna talks
between the 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   U.S. Ambassador John J. Maresca, speaking at a news conference
after the proposal was outlined, said the suggestions on pooling
military information ``will impose burdens on all of us.''
   ``No country has the habit of receiving inspectors regularly into
its military bases,'' he said, referring to proposals for random
inspections in each nation at least three times a year. ``This kind
of openness helps to enhance security.''
   Dutch Ambassador Hans Meesman told reporters, ``We have a duty to
see that secrecy on military matters does not have a chance to undo
a new kind of Europe ... ``Secrecy has done a lot to undermine
confidence'' in the past.
   East German Ambassador Guenter Buehring reportedly said the
proposals would be carefully studied.
   The Western alliance proposes each country:
   _provide information by Dec. 15 each year on weapons procurement
programs for the following year and exact deployment of troops down
to regiment or brigade level, their peacetime strength and equipment;
   _submit at seven days' notice to at least three inspections a
year;
   _give more exact information about maneuvers and advance notice
of all maneuvers involving 50,000 troops or more;
   _improve working facilities for inspectors, observation of
maneuvers and for foreign military attaches and journalists.

<HEAD>Doctors Suggest More Precise Wording in Living Wills</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More people might use living wills to avoid futile
medical treatment if the documents set down specific guidelines for
care rather than vaguely rejecting ``heroic measures'' to maintain
life, two doctors say.
   Only 9 percent of Americans have living wills, although more than
75 percent of the states legally recognize them, the doctors noted
in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Living wills provide people a way of saying that if they become
ill or injured with no hope of recovery, they do not want to be kept
alive indefinitly by mechanical means, such as by a respirator,
which they may believe merely prolongs dying.
   Samples of living wills ``are apparently not reaching physicians
offices or hospitals,'' said the doctors, Linda L. Emanuel of
Massachusetts General Hospital and Ezekiel J. Emanuel of Beth Israel
Hospital in Boston.
   The two recommended a document that outlines right-to-die
dilemmas and appropriate treatments.
   They said living wills tend to be written in vague terms. For
example, some say care should be stopped when ``there is no
reasonable expectation ... of recovery'' or when such care
constitutes ``heroic measures.''
   Such phrases ``are open to multiple interpretations on when to
act and on what interventions the patient would desire,'' said the
doctors.
   People who sign living wills often do so without discussing it
with their doctors, leaving the physicians ignorant of the patients'
wishes, the authors said.
   Many people choose to get around such limitations by giving all
decision-making authority to a relative. But surveys show the
relative often does not know what type of care the patient would
want, said the doctors, who proposed a four-page document that lets
the patient indicate the treatments he would find acceptable in four
situations:
   _ A coma ``with no known hope'' of regaining awareness.
   _ A coma with a ``small likelihood'' of recovering fully, a
``slightly larger likelihood'' of recovering with brain damage, and
a ``much larger likelihood'' of dying.
   _ Irreversible brain damage or disease, accompanied by a terminal
illness.
   _ Irreversible brain damage or disease that makes speaking or
recognizing people impossible, but is not accompanied by terminal
illness.
   For each category, the document would list 12 possible
treatments, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical
breathing, artificial feeding, surgery, drugs and simple diagnostic
tests.
   The form would not eliminate all medical or legal uncertainty,
but it would ``provide a tangible expression of the patient's
wishes,'' the doctors said.

   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping today appeared
in public for the first time in more than three weeks and praised
the military for crushing the student demonstrations for democracy.
   The speech was televised nationally, as were scenes from
demonstrations in several provincial cities, where there were
reports that dissidents and supporters of the pro-democracy movement
were being arrested.
   In Beijing, hundreds of troops took up positions around college
campuses, where the nation's pro-democracy protests began in
mid-April. Many students have returned home or gone into hiding
since the army declared martial law in the capital and violently
ended the protests over the weekend.
   In Washington, President Bush said Thursday the United States
``can't have totally normal relations'' with China until its
government recognizes the rights of the students who led the
demonstrations. But Bush, in a televised news conference, rejected
suggestions he impose more sanctions on China.
   Deng praised the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in an
address to officers of the People's Liberation Army. He thanked them
for their actions, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not
thousands of Beijing residents.
   Deng said the people behind the democratic movement wanted to
``overthrow communism and do away with the socialist system and the
People's Republic of China and establish a capitalist republic.''
   He said, ``Facing a life-threatening situation, our troops never
forgot the people, never forgot the party, never forgot the
country's interest.''
   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and
60,000 injured in the assault, according to a Chinese group in West
Germany, the Union of Chinese Students in the Federal Republic. The
government says 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed; Chinese
and diplomats say up to 3,000 died.
   Deng had not been seen in public since he met Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on May 16. There have been numerous rumors in
recent weeks that Deng was dead or critically ill.
   On his right was conservative Premier Li Peng, who declared
martial law in Beijing on May 20. On Thursday, Li also praised the
soldiers' action in a speech. It was the first appearance by a high
government official in two weeks, indicating China's hard-line
leaders were gaining control of the situation.
   Conspicuously absent was Communist Party General Secretary Zhao
Ziyang, who was reportedly stripped of power by Deng after opposing
the military crackdown on the students, who were demanding
democratic reforms, such as freedom of the press, and an end to
official corruption.
   Qiao Shi, a Politburo Standing Committee member and a top
candidate to replace Zhao, was present, as was Vice Premier Yao
Yilin, a conservative economist and Wan Li, current National
People's Congress chief.
   The television also showed Deng and the others shaking hands with
troops inside the Great Hall of the People.
   Deng's appearance with the other hardliners gave an impression of
party unity as the military extended its control over the capital
and police in other large cities began rounding up participants in
large-scale disturbances that have occurred since the attack on
Beijing on June 3 and 4.
   Television showed what appeared to be burned out, smoldering
blocks in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Violent
demonstrations broke out in Chengdu following the weekend crackdown
in Beijing. Scenes of protest were shown in several other cities
including Shanghai, Changsha, Wuhan and Harbin.
   The television showed dozens of people being arrested for alleged
destructive acts during the protests.
   In Shanghai today, 50,000 students and others gathered to mourn
the deaths of six people who were killed earlier this week when a
train crashed through a barricade set up on railway tracks.
   A Chinese source said police had begun making arrests at night in
at least one apartment complex. The government has reported only
arrests of people allegedly caught trying to set fire to buses or
engaged in other violence.
   ``We know they're picking people up all over the place,'' said
one Western diplomat. ``Don't let people tell you things are calming
down. They're not.''
   In Beijing, gas stations opened and food was more plentiful in
markets. City buses rolled past the tanks on Tiananmen Square for
the first time since June 3. There were no reports of soldiers
firing on crowds.
   More than a dozen tanks and hundreds of armored personnel
carriers could be seen on the square, which has been turned into a
vast military encampment since the army ousted student protesters
with gunfire.
   Concern that factional fighting between rival military groups
might turn Beijing into a killing field abated as troops from
various armies took up stations inside the city without major
conflicts.
   Those fears prompted an exodus of foreigners from the capital,
with most embassies ordering out all dependents and non-essential
staff and many arranging special flights out.
   The U.S. Embassy said registered Americans in China had dropped
from 8,800 before the military crackdown to less than 5,000. Less

<HEAD>Gorbachev Dismisses Danger of Coup; Soviet Foreign Debt At $52 Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with the premier disclosing Soviet
Union's foreign debt, meeting is scheduled end to session. No pickup.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today denied he was
hungry for power and told members of the new Congress that he is in
no danger of being removed from office or assassinated.
   Also today, Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told the final session of
the Congress of People's Deputies the Soviet Union has a foreign
debt of nearly $52 billion. It was the first time the debt figure
was officiallly disclosed.
   He said the amount of the debt explains why the government should
not borrow more from Western sources to import more consumer goods.
   Gorbachev was reacting to criticism from some deputies that for
one man to be both president of the Congress and Communist Party
chief makes him too powerful. ``I categorically reject the hints''
that ``I am trying to concentrate power in my own hands,'' he said.
   And acknowledging persistent rumors he said he heard from
deputies, Gorbachev told the Congress there was ``no danger of a
coup or anything like that.''
   ``Let's end these rumors'' he told the nationally broadcast
session. ``In four years I have already died seven times, and my
family was killed three times.''
   Gorbachev told the 2,250 deputies that the Congress ``can be
considered the biggest event in the history of the Soviet state.''
   The two-week session marked the first time in seven decades the
Kremlin has permitted open debate by popularly elected
representatives, and it produced outspoken criticism of the
government, the Communist Party, Gorbachev and his efforts to deal
with the nation's economic problems.
   Gorbachev said he understood the general dissatisfaction
expressed by the deputies, but he claimed the session marked a new
stage of perestroika, his program to modernize Soviet society.
   Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin and others told Congress
Gorbachev was accumulating too much power. Yeltsin said last week
the ``extraordinary powers'' Gorbachev had been given in the
political overhaul that created the Congress and a stronger
presidency could lead to a ``new dictatorship.''
   ``This is alien to me, to my views, my outlook and my
character,'' Gorbachev said. ``I, as general secretary and
president, have no other policy than perestroika, democratization
and glasnost. In this, I see the point of my life and my work.''
   Ryzhkov, who as premier heads the ministries charged with
carrying out Gorbachev's reforms, used the new debt figure as an
argument against deputies who have called for more foreign loans and
increased imports to ease the country's consumer crisis.
   A Western diplomat said the debt figure of 34 billion rubles,
which amounts to $51.9 billion at the official exchange rate, is
about what foreign analysts estimated, but the long-secretive Soviet
Union has never acknowledged it.
   The Soviet Union has an excellent repayment record with Western
creditors, and the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the debt level is considered relatively small for the size of
the nation's economy.
   The premier told Congress that in order to give deputies ``a
clear idea of our possibilities in this area,'' he would ``perhaps
for the first time, report that the government's current foreign
debt is 34 billion rubles.''
   In the current year, he said, the Soviet Union expects an income
of $24.4 billion in convertible currency. It expects to spend most
of that sum on foreign technology, chemicals, raw materials and
food, leaving only $3.8 billion, he said.
   But the cost of financing existing debt is $18.4 billion a year,
he said, indicating that the pattern of deficit spending is
continuing.
   ``So should we take more loans?'' he asked. ``Should the
situation be aggravated further?''
   The ruble is not traded on international currency markets, and
its value for foreign trade is set by the government, which must use
other currencies or valuable commodities such as gold or oil to pay
its foreign obligations.
   An earlier speech on the economy won a standing ovation from
several deputies for economist Gavriil Popov, one of the more
reform-minded delegates.
   Popov, who listed the expenses that must not be cut despite the
massive budget deficit, said the Soviet Union should compensate the
Afghan people for the damage done by the eight-year Soviet military
presence there and should ``pay all the (Soviet) veterans of the war
in order for us not to be ashamed to look into their eyes.''

<TEXT>
   With the military crackdown in China, the legacy of
empire has returned to haunt the British government.
   Since Chinese troops crushed pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen
Square last weekend, Britain's agreement to hand over the coastal
colony of Hong Kong to neighboring China in 1997 looks to many
people like a giant betrayal.
   Calls are mounting for Britain to open its doors to Hong Kong's
3.2 million Chinese who hold British passports and to renegotiate or
even scrap the agreement Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed in
1984.
   But letting in more immigrants is politically unpopular. And
renegotiating the agreement appears diplomatically impossible.
   Mrs. Thatcher has reaffirmed the agreement and all she has
promised the fearful Hong Kong residents is greater ``flexibility''
in the immigration rules. These allow discretion over letting in
senior public servants and people with private incomes.
   For the most part, the shutters Britain brought down in 1962 to
block immigration from the former empire will remain in place.
   Before the Nationality Act was passed, every citizen of a colony
past or present, including the population of the entire Indian
subcontinent, had the right to settle in this island of 57 million
people.
   In a television interview in Hong Kong today, the leader of
Britain's centrist Liberal and Social Democrats, Paddy Ashdown, said
his country should allow all Hong Kong residents who want to
resettle to do so.
   ``I don't say it is immediately practical,'' he added. ``But I do
believe that Britain has a moral responsibility to take the lead in
this issue.''
   After a meeting with Ashdown, local legislators issued a
statement saying, ``We reiterate our position that Britain has a
fundamental moral duty to extend the right to abode to all the
British nationals in Hong Kong.''
   One lawmaker, Martin Lee, again called for reconsideration of the
agreement on turning Hong Kong back to Chinese rule.
   Elsewhere in the colony, protesters again demonstrated in support
of the pro-democracy campaign suppressed by Chinese authorities.
   Led by more than 100 priests, 7,000 Roman Catholics attended a
Mass at a sports stadium to mourn the Beijing victims. Hundres and
perhaps thousands of people were killed during the crackdown in
Tiananmen Square.
   About 100 fishing boats sailed through Hong Kong harbor, and the
lead vessels displayed a black banner saying, ``Love democracy, Love
freedom.''
   In Britain, nearly 30 years after the country dismantled most of
its globe-girdling empire, the crisis has reopened old wounds and
raised painful questions of duty and honor.
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe resorted to saying China's
aging, hard-line communists may be gone by 1997, that China's
economy will always need Hong Kong's capitalism, and Britain has no
option but to hand over the colony.
   The Spectator, an influential weekly usually sympathetic to Mrs.
Thatcher, wrote: ``If 3.25 million people are to be abandoned ...
she will have presided over the most discreditable British policy of
the 20th century.''
   The China crisis has also highlighted longtime charges that the
immigration rules are aimed mainly at keeping out blacks and Asians.
   Balking at easing the law for Hong Kong, Howe warned the House of
Commons against ``a massive new immigration commitment which could
more than double the ethnic minority population of the United
Kingdom.''
   Critics recall that Mrs. Thatcher went to war against Argentina
in 1982 to reclaim the windswept Falkland Islands and gave its 1,900
people, mostly sheep farming families, the right to settle in
Britain.
   Britain has also given settlement rights to the 30,000 residents
of Gibraltar, which wants to remain British but is claimed by
neighboring Spain.
   The Falklanders and the Gibraltarians are all white and few in
number.
   The government rejects the racism charge, pointing out that since
World War II, Britain has accepted some 1.6 million nonwhite
immigrants from former colonies. In 1972, it waived the rules to
accept some 30,000 Indian-descended Asians expelled from Uganda, a
former colony, by dictator Idi Amin.
   China ceded Hong Kong, a port that has turned into a major
financial center, to Britain in 1898 after a 19th century trade war.
Most of the territory was on a 99-year lease.
   Under the 1984 British-Chinese agreement, China promised to allow
capitalism to exist under communism for 50 years in a government run
by Hong Kong's residents without Chinese interference.
   Critics claim China could override treaty obligations that
safeguard its autonomy and say the military assault to quash a
pro-democracy movement shows that Chinese leaders cannot be trusted.
   Before Sunday, British officials used to portray the 1984
agreement as, at best, a diplomatic triumph negotiated with a
liberalizing China.
   Now, the agreement may herald what London's liberal Guardian
newspaper called ``a pretty repulsive end to empire.''

<TEXT>
   Time Inc. Chairman J. Richard Munro has lashed
out at the head of Paramount Communications Inc., claiming he broke
a promise not to pursue Time by launching a hostile $10.7 billion
bid.
   ``You've changed the name of your corporation, but it's still
`engulf and devour,''' Munro wrote in a three-page letter to
Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis.
   Paramount, which made the letter public Thursday, recently
changed its name from Gulf &amp; Western. The company's reputation for
actively pursuing acquisitions in the 1960s and 1970s won it the
nickname ``engulf and devour.''
   That moniker was used by Mel Brooks as the name of a fictional
movie studio in the film ``Silent Movie.''
   ``On a personal level, I'm disappointed that I can't rely on you
as a man of your word,'' the letter said, calling Paramount's offer
``ill-conceived.''
   Davis responded by saying that Time ``voluntarily relinquished''
its independence recently by agreeing to merge with Warner
Communications Inc. Paramount's bid threatens to dash the
Time-Warner deal, which would create the world's biggest media and
entertainment concern.
   Meanwhile, Time stock slipped a bit as some stock traders took
quick profits after Wednesday's meteoric rise.
   Time fell $2 a share to close at $168 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading Thursday. It had soared $44 Wednesday after
Paramount's announcement of its $175-a-share offer.
   Securities analysts said traders and arbitragers who play
takeover stocks may not have liked everything they saw when they got
their first good look at Paramount's offer.
   The offer prospectus contained several pages of cautions to
investors and qualifications about the deal, including the need for
government approval, said J. Kendrick Noble, an analyst with
PaineWebber Inc.
   ``It looks like it's going to be a long process and it might not
go through at all,'' Noble said.
   The government might take months to rule on antitrust
implications of a Paramount buyout, said Fred Anschel, who follows
Time for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. Paramount and Time both have
extensive holdings in publishing and cable television.
   ``Some arbitragers may be realizing that and may be turning off
the stock for that reason,'' Anschel said.
   Meanwhile, Paramount stock surged $3.62{ to close at $58.37{, and
stock in Warner Communications _ whose planned merger with Time is
threatened by the Paramount bid _ rose $3 to $56.50.
   Noble said speculation that bids could emerge for Paramount or
Warner drove up those companies' share prices.
   In early trading today, the stocks of all three companies were
slightly lower. Time slipped an additional 50 cents to $167.50 a
share, while Paramount was off 25 cents to $58.12{ and Warner was
down $1 to $55.50.
   Despite Thursday's modest decline, most traders were sticking
with their Time holdings, willing to see the battle through.
   There was no word Thursday on what Time's next step would be. Lou
Slovinsky, a Time spokesman, said he could not comment on the
company's plans.

<HEAD>Burma Says Military Will Retain Power for Now</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The military government announced today it
will retain power in Burma until an elected parliament writes a new
constitution, a process that one diplomat said could take years.
   Gen. Saw Maung's government emerged in September after months of
pro-democracy protests drove out three presidents, then were crushed
violently by the military. The new leaders pledge to hold the first
democratic elections after more than 25 years of one-party socialist
rule, but no date has been set.
   At a Rangoon news conference today, a government spokesman, Col.
Aung Thein, said the government ``will hand over power immediately
to a systematically formed government after the elections.''
   But he said the new parliament first must write a constitution.
The previous constitution was abolished when the military took over.
A government timetable seems to suggest that elections will be held
in May 1990.
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon said the latest government
announcement was bad news for opposition groups. ``It could take
weeks, it could take years to formulate a constitution,'' he said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Opposition leaders want an immediate power transfer after the
elections.

   A medical team from Brooke Army Medical Center
will be dispatched to the Soviet Union today to help treat burn
victims from last weekend's gas explosion and train disaster.
   The 15-member team was requested by the Soviet Union on Thursday
night, said medical center spokesman Bob Clarke.
   ``The Soviet government did not grant permission to send any
Soviet citizens to the United States for treatment,'' he said.
   Clarke said the burn team will travel from Kelly to Andrews Air
Force Base in Washington, and Ramstein Air Force Base in West
Germany on the way to Moscow.
   ``At a minimum, the team will include three surgeons, three
registered nurses, six licensed practical nurses and three
respiratory therapists,'' Clarke said. ``With the team will also go
a large volume of medical supplies and equipment.''
   Hundreds were killed when liquefied natural gas from a leaking
pipeline exploded as two crowded trains were passing on nearby rails
in the Soviet Ural mountains.

   Saying he was used as a pawn by strangers in
the anit-abortion wars, a man has filed a $10 million lawsuit
against those who forced him to go to the U.S. Supreme Court to get
an abortion for his comatose wife.
   ``My family and I feel that these strangers had no right to
interfere with our family tragedy and decision,'' said Martin Klein,
35, an accountant from Upper Brookville.
   The defendants were accused of inflicting ``severe and
emotional'' stress on Klein and his family. The lawsuit filed
Thursday in state Supreme Court names North Shore University
Hospital in Manhasset and anti-abortion activists John Short of
Farmingdale and John Broderick of Syosset.
   Klein also said Thursday that his wife is out of her coma and
making steady progress, though she is still unable to speak.
   Nancy Klein, who was about four months pregnant, was injured and
left comatose in a car accident in December. Some doctors told Klein
his wife might have a better chance at recovery if an abortion was
done, but the hospital balked, saying Klein had to get a court order
appointing him as his wife's guardian.
   Klein went to court in January seeking guardianship, but
Broderick and Short battled him fiercely, losing each time but
appealing all the way to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeals,
New York's highest court, sharply criticized the two as ``absolute
strangers'' to the Klein family and questioned their motives.
   The abortion was performed Feb. 11 at North Shore when U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall refused to hear the appeal.
   ``Martin Klein was used as a pawn for the personal and moral
interests of John Short, John Broderick and North Shore,'' the
lawsuit stated, accusing the defendants of conspiring ``to delay the
abortion procedure and interfere with the personal and private
affairs of Martin Klein and his family.''
   Klein incurred more than $50,000 in legal expenses, according to
the lawsuit.
   Short said he believes he had a legal right to try to intervene
in the case.
   ``All we tried to do was prevent Klein from allowing the abortion
that would kill his child,'' said Short, 57, a self-employed
accountant.
   Anthony D'Auria, attorney for North Shore, called the lawsuit
``frivolous'' and said the hospital would fight it.
   Mrs. Klein, 32, is in a long-term rehabilitation center, Klein
said. She is ``making slow but steady progress,'' he said. She does
not yet speak, but recognizes family and friends.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's chief public prosecutor
today asked legal authorities to drop charges that led to the
execution of Imre Nagy, the leader of the 1956 popular uprising.
   Prosecutor Karoly Szijarto also said nine Nagy associates, some
of whom were executed with him, should be cleared.
   On May 31, Communist Party leaders issued a statement that
amounted to political rehabilitation of Nagy. They said Nagy had
become a symbol of communist reform and a significant figure in
postwar history.
   Szijarto made his request of the Supreme Court, proposing that
``the illegal sentences be revoked and the innocent people who were
condemned be acquitted,'' the state news agency MTI reported.
   Nagy led a short-lived rebellion that was crushed by Soviet tanks
and troops on Nov. 4, 1956. He was tried for treason and other
charges along with his political aides and executed on June 16, 1958.
   In his statement, the prosecutor said authorities at the time
``gravely and repeatedly violated the rules of criminal procedure in
effect at the time, particularly by limiting the freedom of the
accused and their right to defense,'' according to MTI.
   He was quoted as saying the accusations were ``unfounded and
unlawful.''
   Nagy is to be reburied in elaborate ceremonies on June 16.
   His body will be placed in a marked grave in the same Budapest
cemetery where it has lain without a marker since 1958. It is
believed that six associates will be reburied with him.

<TEXT>
   A 5-week-old baby living with her family
at a local homeless shelter has died from head injuries, and police
suspect two 4-year-olds may be responsible for the death.
   Sarah Franklin died at Saturday morning, but police didn't
release details of the incident until Wednesday after receiving an
autopsy report that classified the death as a homicide.
   The chief state medical examiner's office determined the infant
died from severe head injuries. There were also bruises and bite
marks on the body.
   Sarah and her twin were left alone on a bed in their second-floor
room at St. Luke's Community Services family shelter while their
mother, Suzette Franklin, went downstairs to sterilize a bottle,
police said.
   A neighbor entered the Franklin room and found Sarah lying on the
floor, police said. The baby's mother thought she had locked the
door when she left, but one of the 4-year-olds suspected in the case
showed police how to open the locked door.
   The unrelated 4-year-old girl and boy suspected in the case lived
near the Franklin room, police said. They have not been identified
and they won't be charged with any crime because of their age,
police said.
   Deputy Police Chief John Perrotta said the two children didn't
intend to kill the baby, although police still haven't put together
the events leading up to the death.
   The deputy chief also said the parents of the children involved
won't be charged with any crime.
   Police said they are trying to get permission from the parents of
the 4-year-olds to get teeth impressions in an effort to determine
the source of bite marks. Police would not say whether the teeth
marks appeared to have been made by a child or an adult.
   The infant's mother has moved from the shelter and her two other
children, Sarah's twin and a 17-month-old boy, are in the custody of
the Department of Children and Youth Services until the police
investigation is completed.
   ``Every member of the staff feels terribly about this. We will
live with this for the rest of our lives,'' said the Rev. Richard
Schuster, the shelter's coordinator.

   A Soviet pilot who defected to Turkey in a
MiG-29 jet fighter was flown to the United States today after U.S.
authorities agreed to grant him asylum, the Turkish Foreign Ministry
said.
   An Istanbul daily reported today that Soviet air force Capt.
Alexander Zuyev defected last month because he feared President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's social and economic reforms would drive the
Soviet Union into a civil war.
   A Soviet official in Turkey said today that Zuyev should have
been extradited to the Soviet Union, as Moscow requested.
   Inal Batu, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Zuyev was handed
over to U.S. officials and Zuyev left Turkey aboard a U.S. military
plane early today.
   Zuyev landed the aircraft at the airport of the Black Sea coastal
city of Trabzon on May 20 and requested political asylum in the
United States.
   Turkish officials, appearing anxious not to damage relations with
their neighbor, sent the MiG-29 back to the Soviet Union a day after
the incident.
   Turkey's decision to immediately return the fighter plane
dismayed U.S. authorities, who hoped Turkey, a fellow NATO member,
would permit them to inspect the aircraft and its advanced
technology.
   The Soviet Union immediately asked Turkish officials to extradite
the pilot, saying he stole the jet fighter and shot and wounded a
sentry guarding the aircraft at Tskhakaya airport.
   Turkey on Thursday officially rejected the Soviet extradition
request and relayed his asylum petition to the U.S. Embassy.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said a Turkish court ruled Tuesday
that the accusations against Zuyev were political and military,
allowing him to qualify for refugee status.
   Soviet Ambassador Albert Cernishev today said he was disappointed
by the decision to let the pilot go to the United States. He said
the Soviet Union would now ask U.S. authorities to extradite him.
   ``We insist on our position that Zuyev should be extradited... We
consider him a common criminal,'' the ambassador said at a news
conference.
   The Istanbul daily Gunes today printed excerpts from Zuyev's
testimony to Turkish security officials. Gunes quoted Zuyev as
saying the policies of the Gorbachev would drive the Soviet Union
into a civil war and that he escaped to avoid such a future.
   Zuyev said he was a single man and left behind only his mother,
who since her husband's death had remarried, the newspaper reported.
   The Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported earlier that
Zuyev was married and left behind a pregnant wife.

   Officials in Florida and Louisiana today mourned five people
killed in storms but said they were lucky that powerful twisters
blasting out of Gulf thunderstorms hadn't caused more fatalities.
   One tornado Thursday night wracked the Florida Panhandle fishing
village of Eastpoint, killing three members of a family. It
destroyed 19 houses and narrowly missed a nursing home.
   ``We haven't found the house (where the family died) yet. Their
bodies were found several hundred yards from where the house once
was,'' said Pat McWhinnie, Franklin County sheriff's dispatcher.
   In Louisiana, cleanup efforts began today in the wake of Thursday
morning's storms. Tornadoes hit seven parishes in the southern part
of the state, killing two people in mobile homes in the town of
Grosse Tete and damaging scores of homes there and 15 miles east in
Baton Rouge.
   ``We can't imagine how more aren't dead,'' said Willie Hurdle, an
Iberville Parish official who surveyed the scene at Grosse Tete.
``This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that aren't even here
anymore.''
   About two dozen others were injured in the tornado.
   Police sealed the town off to prevent looting and used dogs to
search the rubble for bodies or survivors.
   Officials used a chain saw to free an elderly woman from the
wreckage of her home.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer toured the area by helicopter. He said two
companies of Louisiana National Guard soldiers would be sent to help
authorities enforce a night curfew to discourage looters.
   Baton Rouge Fire Chief Ron Spillman said four tornadoes touched
down 19 times in East Baton Rouge Parish, destroying or damaging
almost 70 mobile homes and 25 to 30 houses.
   From 400 to 600 people lived in the destroyed or damaged
residences, Spillman estimated. A shelter was set up at a high
school for those left homeless.
   Kimberly Carver was asleep in her mobile home at the Pecue Lake
Mobile Home Park when one of the twisters ripped through the
neighborhood.
   ``Somehow, I just ended up between the mattress and box springs.
Everything in my bedroom was flying. If I wasn't between the
mattress and the box spring, I would have gotten hurt. It happened
so fast,'' Carver said.
   Authorities reported three injuries in Baton Rouge, none serious.
   Gulf State Utilities crews worked into the morning to restore
power to about 3,500 residents in the Baton Rouge area.
   John Boss, a photographer for the State-Times in Baton Rouge, and
Rita F. Gilmer were caught in the middle of the storm near a bridge
over the Mississippi River.
   ``Two houses blew up right across the levee from where we were,''
he said. ``Limbs were snapping off trees and flying all over us. We
were afraid we were going to be hit by all the debris. I was scared
to death. It was hell.''
   In Florida, Franklin County Sheriff Warren Roddenberry said
today, ``We were extremely lucky. The devastation we've had and no
more than three fatalities and two minor injuries is just amazing.''
   A grandmother, mother and son died when the tornado hit their
home in Eastpoint, about 85 miles southwest of Tallahassee.
   Most of the demolished houses in Eastpoint were mobile homes,
officials said. Eight cars and several utility sheds also were
destroyed. A hardware store lost its roof, and a boat building
business was demolished.
   ``It was monstrous _ like the tornado in the `Wizard of Oz,' ''
said Tracey Hardman after seeing the twister. ``It was awesome.''
   The tornados were the worst to hit the Panhandle in three years,
said National Weather Service spokesman Ray Lowe.
   Earlier Thursday, a U.S. park ranger was hurt when a tornado
carried away the shelter at Gulf Islands National Seashore in which
she had taken refuge. Amanda Rhodes suffered a broken arm and cuts
when she was blown 10 to 15 yards. The 20-by-30-foot wood-frame
entrance station was demolished, officials said.
   Elsewhere in Florida, another tornado ripped the roof from a
grocery store near Perdido Key, southwest of Pensacola, causing at
estimated $75,000 to $80,000 in damage, said Cheryl Lively,
spokeswoman for the Escambia County Emergency Operations Center.
   Another tornado demolished a home near the neighboring
communities of Holley and Navarre about 20 miles east of Pensacola,
Santa Rosa County authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   Tornados and thunderstorms also swept through coastal Alabama,
damaging dozens of homes, but no serious injuries were reported,
authorities said.

<HEAD>Envelopes Of Poison Found In Cereal Boxes, Marked `This Box Poisoned'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOPEWELL JUNCTION, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Envelopes containing rat poison
were found inside two cereal boxes bought at local grocery stores,
apparently put there by someone seeking to publicize a dispute over
a condominium complex, authorities said.
   The first instance of tampering was reported Monday when a man
found an envelope marked ``This box has been poisoned'' in a box of
bran flakes, the Dutchess County Sheriff's Department said Thursday.
   That incident was followed by a letter sent to the Poughkeepsie
Journal threatening that hundreds of boxes would be poisoned if
Chelsea Cove condominiums didn't address alleged problems stemming
from unfinished construction at the site.
   The second envelope, found in a box of corn flakes, was returned
Wednesday to an A&amp;P supermarket about three miles from the first
supermarket and carried the same warning as the first, said
sheriff's Capt. Dennis O'Keeffe.
   Although the envelopes were inside the boxes, the bags containing
the cereal had not been tampered with and no rat pellets were found
in the cereal itself, police said.
   Residents of the complex acknowledged Thursday that many of them
were embroiled in a dispute, principally over drainage problems and
safety concerns, with developer L. Richard Rosenberg. But they said
they deplored the tampering.
   ``I certainly don't condone anything like that,'' said Carl
Garolfolo, president of Chelsea Cove's North Side Homeowners
Association.
   The FBI would confirm only that a product tampering investigation
was under way in the Dutchess County area, said New York City FBI
spokesman Joe Valiquette.
   O'Keeffe said officials at Chelsea Cove had provided names of
people who had been unhappy with the condominium complex. The
5-year-old lakeside development about eight miles west of here will
have 600 units when finished, said Joel Sasser, the development's
general manager.
   Sheriff Fred Scoralick said local stores have been notified and
authorities are asking Dutchess County consumers to watch for signs
of tampering in cereal and other products.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper enriched family, friends and
employees with both words and gifts in the will he signed only six
weeks before his death.
   The will, filed June 2 in Dade County Probate Court, places the
value of Pepper's estate ``in excess of $500,000, but less than $1
million.''
   The 88-year-old congressman, who died May 30, left most of his
estate to his brother, other relatives and an administrative aide.
   In his will, he also penned tributes to his late mother and
father, Joseph and Lena Pepper.
   ``My father was a good, great and brave man,'' Pepper wrote. And
his mother, he wrote, was ``a lady of good intellect, keen sense of
humor, great courage and indomitable character.''
   He described his 42-year marriage to his late wife, Mildred, an
``immeasurable privilege'' and thanked her for all her help ``in any
achievements I may have attained or any worthy contributions I might
have made to my District, my State and my Country and to mankind.''
   Pepper asked that Frances Campbell, his long-time administrative
assistant in Congress and personal representative for his estate, be
named director of the Mildred and Claude Pepper Library in
Tallahassee. She also received $5,000 and a car.
   To the library, he left his books, papers, awards, paintings and
memorabilia.
   The white Lincoln he drove in Miami and his cottage on Lake
Bradford near Tallahassee went to his brother Frank, who also
received $50,000.
   Pepper also left almost $100,000 to two nieces and a nephew.
   To long-time employee Bertha Carver he left his Ford and $10,000.
   He also left small sums of money to members of the House Rules
Committee staff and the Subcommittee on Health and Long-Term Care.

<HEAD>Judge Combines Charges Against Iran-Contra Defendant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge today consolidated two sets of
criminal charges against Iran-Contra figure Richard Secord into a
single indictment.
   Over Secord's objections, Chief U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey
Robinson combined three counts of a March 1988 indictment with nine
new charges handed up by a federal grand jury in April.
   The 1988 charges allege that Secord conspired, offered and paid
illegal gratuities to Oliver L. North. As a White House aide, North
enlisted Secord to run arms to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua during
a congressional ban on military aid to them.
   The nine more recent charges allege that Secord lied to Congress
to cover up his own profits in the Iran-Contra affair. They also
allege that Secord lied to Congress by denying that North received
benefits from a maze of companies known as the Enterprise that
Secord and business partner Albert Hakim set up in the affair.
   North was convicted last month of three crimes, including
accepting a $13,800 home security system from Secord.
   ``The interests of judicial economy and sound administration of
justice support consolidation,'' Judge Robinson said in a two-page
order on the Secord matter.
   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, argued against combining the two
sets of charges, saying his client should be tried on the 1988
charges and that the new indictment should be dismissed.
   Green said the indictments ``are not logically related,'' but the
judge disagreed.
   Robinson said proof relating to the 1988 criminal charges ``would
be admissible to prove'' the nine new charges.
   On Thursday, associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten said
the government would seek dismissal of broad conspiracy and theft
counts against Secord once the other charges were consolidated.
   Conspircy and theft counts against North also had been dismissed
because of national security concerns. Intelligence agencies have
refused to declassify material that would be needed to try those
charges.

<TEXT>
   More than 5,000 people chanting ``Freedom will
survive!'' packed a Chinatown park this morning in a memorial
service for students slain by soldiers in Tiananmen Square. They
then marched through the streets in a funeral procession.
   ``The gods are crying for what's happening in China today. It's a
great tragedy,'' said Harry Zinn of International Ladies Garment
Workers Union Local 2325, addressing the crowd through a steady
rain. ``Our hearts go out to the people of China.''
   The crowd, which stood respectfully and silently during a
traditional funeral ceremony, waved banners and wore buttons
honoring ``the martyrs of Tiananmen Square'' and calling for
democracy in China.
   After the service and several speeches, the crowd marched through
the streets of Chinatown, led by a casket and a traditional Chinese
funeral bier containing fruit and incense. As they headed up
Mulberry Street, a major street in Chinatown, they walked beneath a
30-foot black banner strung across the road.
   ``This has united the Chinese people for one cause _ to overthrow
the government and establish democracy,'' said Peter Lee, one of the
student organizers of the service. ``We must never allow them to
crush another body.''
   The funeral procession stretched for blocks through Chinatown,
tying up traffic. Demonstrators planned another rally later in the
day outside the United Nations.

   The White House today denounced as
``repugnant'' calls by Chinese officials for reprisals against
student leaders of the pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Despite the reappearance of Chinese leaders in public, including
the first view of leader Deng Xiaoping in more than three weeks,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it still is not clear
who ordered the killing of civilian demonstrators in Tiananmen
Square last weekend.
   Fitzwater told reporters that U.S.-Chinese relations will not
soon return to normal.
   ``Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its
citizens. We have had an incredible upheaval in (that) country,'' he
said.
   Citing loudspeaker calls in Beijing for neighbors to turn in
demonstrators, and for punishment of student demonstrators who met
with hard-line Prime Minister Li Peng, Fitzwater said: ``Reprisals
are repugnant. We certainly watch this situation with grave
concern.''
   The spokesman said ``no one doubts in terms of the overall
government'' who is in charge in China, ``but in terms of individual
actions and individual decisions and motivations and
responsibilities, that's where we don't know.''
   ``You can watch television and see who the government is, but in
terms of individual actions and motivations ... we don't know,'' he
reiterated.
   President Bush, in his televised news conference Thursday night,
refused to fix blame for the massacre in Beijing but said it would
be ``extraordinarily difficult'' to have ties with anyone
responsible for the bloodshed.
   Bush said the United States won't have normal relations with
China until the government there recognizes demands for democracy.
   Despite a military crackdown that killed hundreds if not
thousands of people in Beijing, Bush emphasized Thursday night that
he wants to ``preserve the relationship'' with China.
   But for that relationship to be normal, he said, ``it will take a
recognition of the rights of individuals and respect for the rights
of those who disagree.''
   He said, ``I don't want to pass judgment on individual leaders
but I want to make very clear to those leaders and to the rest of
the world that the United States denounces the kind of brutality
that all of us have seen on our television.''
   Pressed on whether he could maintain relations with anyone who
ordered the firing on unarmed students, Bush said, ``It would make
it extraordinarily difficult.''
   Bush answered questions at the televised news conference for 33
minutes. He appeared relaxed and confident, joking at times with his
interrogators and expressing pleasure when a reporter wished his
wife, Barbara, happy birthday on her 64th.
   Bush took the opportunity to say the first lady was ``doing just
fine'' after treatment for a thyroid problem.
   On other matters, Bush:
   _Said he opposed public disclosure of people who test positive
for AIDS. ``There is a certain right to privacy that we should
respect,'' he said, adding, however, that people who test positive
should inform their doctors and sexual partners.
   _Said he will tell Polish leaders during a visit next month ``we
want to work with you'' as long as economic and pro-democracy
reforms continue. ``When a country moves as Poland did, down
democracy's path, the United States should respond as best it
could,'' he said.
   _Said he would not give up on his campaign to drive from power
Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, who has been indicted in
Miami on drug-smuggling charges.
   Foreign policy issues dominated the questioning.
   Bush said he was encouraged by Moscow's response to his proposal
for cutbacks in Soviet and American combat troops in Europe to
275,000 each.
   He said agreement on that plan could ease tensions in NATO about
updating short-range nuclear missiles _ a plan that West Germany
opposes.
   While saying he wants to see Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
economic reforms succeed, Bush said, ``I am going to keep my eyes
wide open.''
   He also urged Iran's new leaders to help free American hostages
in Lebanon and to renounce terrorism if they want better relations
with the United States.
   On the political front in Washington, where congressional
Republicans and Democrats are bitterly attacking each other over
ethics issues, Bush said ``this ugliness of this climate is bad and
I don't like it and I'd like to think that I could help.''
   He said newly elected Democratic House Speaker Thomas Foley,
tarred by a Republican Party circular comparing his record to that
of a homosexual congressman, had been rendered ``a terrible ill
service.''
   Bush said GOP chairman Lee Atwater ``looked me right in the eye
and said he did not know about'' the circular, whose purported
author, Mark Goodin, resigned as a Republican press aide on
Wednesday.
   Discussing China, Bush repeatedly referred to his experience as
U.S. envoy to Beijing in 1974-1975 but said U.S. understanding of
developments in China was ``very, very murky.''
   Bush said he felt a ``sense of personal disappointment'' in the
government's turn toward violence.
   Asked whether Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping was still in charge,
Bush said, ``I don't know.'' Pointing around the room of reporters,
he said, ``And you don't know. And he doesn't know. And she doesn't
know and nobody knows _ outside (of China). And that's the way the
Chinese system works.''
   Given his personal ties with China, Bush was asked why he didn't
pick up the telephone and call the country's leaders. ``The line was
busy. I couldn't get through,'' he said.
   Defending his decision not to invoke more sanctions beyond his
suspension of military sales to China, Bush said the United States
is engaged in diplomatic efforts that he hopes will ease the
situation.
   Bush said, ``We aren't going to remake the world but we should
stand for something. And there's no question in the minds of these
students (in China) that the United States is standing in their
corners.''

   Police overpowered a man who rushed toward
Pope John Paul II today while the pontiff was distributing Holy
Communion at an outdoor Mass, the Swedish national news agency TT
reported.
   A police officer confirmed that a Swede was detained, but he had
no further details. TT said security guards tackled the man, who
appeared to be in his 20s, as he ran toward the pope at a Mass
outside this university city.
   It was not immediately known how close the man got to the pope or
whether he was armed. It was the first incident during John Paul's
tour of five Scandinavian countries, which ends on Saturday.
   Earlier today, the pope hailed Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish
diplomat who saved thousands of Jews from Nazi death camps, as an
inspiration in the battle to protect human rights.
   The pope also issued his toughest attack on abortion and
euthanasia of his Scandinavian tour, declaring that ``whether in the
womb or in the final phase of life, a person may never be disposed
of in order to make life easier for others.''
   Speaking at 500-year-old Uppsala University, the pope deplored
``great nations'' this century that ignored their cultural
traditions and sought to exterminate entire populations and
discriminate against religious and ethnic groups. He praised those
who have ``heroically opposed such aberrations through courageous
acts or resistance and compassion.''
   ``I cannot fail to mention your compatriot Raoul Wallenberg, who
in praiseworthy fashion rescued so many members of the Jewish people
from Nazi concentration camps. His example inspires a dedicated
fight for human rights.''
   Wallenberg is credited with saving tens of thousands of Hungarian
Jews from extermination. His fate has been a subject of contention.
   In January 1945, he was arrested by Soviet troops entering
Budapest. Moscow has said he died in a Soviet prison in 1947, but
Soviet dissident sources claim he was seen alive in the 1980s. The
Swedish and U.S. governments and private groups have called on the
Soviets to release all the facts in the case.
   On the next to last day of his five-country tour of the
overwhelmingly Lutheran region, John Paul visited this religious and
university center of Sweden, 35 miles from Stockholm for a prayer
service in the Lutheran cathedral attended by 2,000 people,
including King Carl Gustaf XVI and Queen Silvia.
   About 10 demonstrators stood outside the cathedral distributing
pamphlets reading ``the pope is a messenger of the devil.'' There
were no incidents.
   Making another appeal for improved relations between Rome and the
Lutherans, the pope said, ``It is a challenge for us to forgive each
other, but the Lord has commanded us to do so.''
   He then went to a nearby university hall, where he stressed a
``person cannot be reduced to the status of a means or a tool of
others.''
   ``Society exists to promote the security and dignity of the
person. Therefore the primary right which society must defend is the
right to life.''
   The pope visited Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark and Sweden on
his tour.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale inflation came roaring back in May
after a two-month lull, rising a steep 0.9 percent, the government
said today.
   The increase in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
primarily reflected higher prices for cars, fresh vegetables and
gasoline.
   For the first five months of the year, wholesale inflation for
goods one stop short of the retail level was running at a 9.4
percent annual rate, more than double the 4 percent rise in 1988 and
quadruple the 2.2 percent 1987 gain.
   The index troubled economists earlier this year, when it soared
1.1 percent in January and 0.9 percent in February. But moderate
rises of 0.4 percent in both March and April had been seen as a sign
that inflation had retreated at least a bit.
   In advance of today's report, many economists were predicting a
moderate-to-brisk 0.5 percent gain.
   Financial markets, which have been rallying in recent weeks on
evidence that the overheated economy is cooling enough to produce
milder price pressures, turned down modestly in early trading today.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dipped about 1{ points
in the first hour of trading.
   Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser,
attributed most of the inflation so far this year to the ``special
factors'' of energy and food and predicted better numbers ahead.
   ``We want to remain vigilant against inflation. We expect
inflation to stabilize in the second half of the year and decline
thereafter,'' Boskin told reporters at a White House briefing.
   Energy prices in May rose 3.3 percent, a steep increase but less
than half April's 30-month record of 7.2 percent. For the past six
months, energy prices have surged at a 43.3 percent annual rate.
   In May, the increase was propelled by a 5.2 percent jump in
gasoline prices, which followed a 13.4 percent jump in April.
Natural gas prices rose 3.4 percent, while heating oil costs
declined 7.7 percent.
   Food prices, which had posted a rare 0.6 percent decline in
April, rebounded 0.8 percent in May. The price of vegetables
skyrocketed 26.4 percent as celery and tomato prices doubled and
cabbage prices rose by one-third.
   There were also significant increases for eggs, rice, pasta and
chicken. Prices for beef, pork and fish declined.
   For the past six months, food prices have risen at an annual rate
of 7.3 percent. But analysts expect that trend to moderate, barring
a repeat of last year's drought.
   The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy
sectors, often taken by analysts as a truer reflection of underlying
inflationary pressures, rose 0.5 percent last month following an
unusual 0.1 percent decline in April.
   The increase in May was largely driven by a 1.8 percent rebound
in auto prices following a 2.8 percent decline a month earlier.
   The April drop was produced by manufacturers' incentives to
bolster sagging sales, while a Labor Department analyst said the
rebound was driven by price increases fnd 0.9 percent in February.
But moderate rises of 0.4 percent in both March and April had been
seen as a sign that inflation had retreated at least a bit.
   Energy prices in May rose 3.3 percent, a steep increase but less
than half April's 30-month record of 7.2 percent. For the past six
months, energy prices havergy prices have surged at a 43.3 percent
annual rate.
   In May, the increase was propelled by a 5.2 percent jump in
gasoline prices, which followed a 13.4 percent jump in April.
Natural gas prices rose 3.4 percent, while heating oil costs
declined 7.7 perceces, which had posted a rar bread, flour and wheat.
   Traders in financial markets were looking to today's report to
provide an indication of how far and how fast the Federal Reserve
Board will lower interest rates.
   Earlier this week, the Fed nudged the key federal funds rate _
the interest charged banks for overnight loans _ down by one-quarter
of a percentage point to near 8{ percent.
   Stock and bond markets rallied in response, taking the change as
evidence the central bank has decided to end its 15-month campaign
of fighting inflation with higher interest rates.
   Michael K. Evans, president of Evans Economics Inc. in
Washington, said today's report means the Fed likely will wait at
least a month before loosening credit further.
   ``I don't think there's going to be any further easing by the Fed
until we ... get some good inflation numbers for more than one month
at a time,'' he said.
   Still, analysts were optimistic that inflation reports eventually
would improve. Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State
University said he believed gasoline prices have now more than
reflected the run-up in crude oil prices this spring and will
stabilize.
   His view is bolstered by the deal struck Wednesday by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which set a higher
target for crude oil production.

<TEXT>
   Police are investigating the death of an
8-year-old boy who was fatally shot when a friend fired a shotgun as
the two were playing cowboys and Indians at the 9-year-old's home.
   Jason Lunsford, a second-grade student at John G. Carlisle
Elementary School in Covington, was killed Wednesday night, police
said Thursday.
   Police Lt. Bill Dorsey said authorities are trying to determine
how the boys got the shotgun and a loaded .22-caliber revolver that
Jason was playing with. Police will try to determine whether
criminal negligence was involved, Dorsey said.
   The death was the second in two months of a student at Carlisle,
Covington's largest elementary school, which has 850 students.
   Police are still trying to solve the slaying of first-grader
Jenny Sue Iles, 7, whose body was found in an abandoned house on May
1.
   ``We were just recovering from the Jenny Iles situation when this
happened,'' Carlisle principal Mike Ellis said Thursday. ``We tried
to keep a low profile on this one because (Thursday) was our last
day of school and we did not want to get the children upset again.
   ``The teachers weren't saying anything about it. Very few kids
knew about it, as far as I can tell.''
   Ellis said Jason was a ``friendly boy who was on the energetic,
adventurous side.'' The youngster would have received his report
card Thursday, showing that he had passed into the third grade next
fall.
   Jenny was last seen April 21. Police believe foul play was
involved, but have made no arrests.

<HEAD>Afghan Leader Says Communists Must Be Included In Peace Talks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Najib says his communist
government must be included in any talks to end the decade-long war
with American-backed Moslem fundamentalists.
   Najib also said the apparent change of policy by the United
States and Pakistan toward a political rather than military solution
could hasten an end to Afghanistan's conflict.
   In Washington this week, President Bush and Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan agreed to press for a political solution
on Afghanistan. But they also said they will continue to arm the
guerrillas and seek Najib's fall.
   ``How can a political solution be achieved without the lawful
government of Afghanistan?'' the nation's official Bakhtar news
agency quoted Najib as saying in an interview Thursday night.
   ``We believe it is not appropriate for the United States and
Pakistan to dictate the acceptable models and prescriptions for a
political solution to the people of Afghanistan.''
   Pakistan shares a border with Afghanistan and is the main conduit
of arms for the guerrillas.
   The insurgents refuse to negotiate with Najib, the former chief
of the Afghan secret police who seized power in a Soviet-backed coup
10 years ago. But their war has stalled since the withdrawal of the
last Soviet soldiers on Feb. 15.
   Pakistani officials say the guerrillas should be able to
negotiate with the Kabul government if Najib and other leaders of
his People's Democratic Party are ousted.
   ``They speak of a political solution but also of supplying arms
and continuing the war,'' Najib said. ``How can they justify this
contradiction? Does the continuation of military supplies to people
who openly refuse a political solution not mean supporting a
continuation of war and bloodshed?''
   Ms. Bhutto is concerned about 3 million Afghan refugees living in
Pakistan, and influential U.S. lawmakers have told Bush that merely
continuing to arm the guerrillas is not an adequate policy.
   The Pakistani leader was to discuss Afghanistan with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar on Friday.
   American officials are receptive to the formation of what Ms.
Bhutto called a ``stable, independent and neutral Afghanistan'' and
say they expect serious discussions about it with the Soviet Union.
Washington previously refused Soviet appeals for talks, saying the
resistance could win a swift military victory.
   Moscow has asked Saudi Arabia, another guerrilla backer, to
persuade the fighters to negotiate, Kuwait's al-Anbaa newspaper
reported Friday, quoting the Soviet first deputy foreign minister,
Yuli Vorontsov.
   ``Saudi Arabia is reluctant to do so. But we are hopeful that
eventually Saudi Arabia will agree,'' it quoted Vorontsov as saying.
   Najib said: ``The republic of Afghanistan sees with joy that
prospects of resolving the country's problems are emerging. Those
people who until recently insisted on a military solution and
rejected any other alternative today in principle, if not in deed,
are accepting the position of the Afghan government. ``However, our
happiness would be greater if we saw that Ms. Bhutto and Mr. Bush
were accompanying their remarks with good will and that they did not
make the removal of the lawful government of Afghanistan a condition
for reaching a political solution.''
   Najib did not refer to demands he step down. The 43-year-old
president already has said he would resign if that would guarantee
an end to the conflict, which has claimed more than 1 million lives.
But he insists the government be part of any settlement.

   Antonio Macedo, a former leader of the
Portuguese Socialist Party, died Friday at age 82.
   Macedo retired from politics in 1987 but remained honorary
president of the party.
   Party officials declared a 48-hour halt to campaigning for the
European Parliament elections in respect for Macedo.
   Later, leading candidates from the governing Social Democratic
Party and the conservative Social and Democratic Center also halted
their campaigns in honor of Macedo's role in establishing Portuguese
democracy.
   A vigourous opponent of the the rightist dictatorship that ruled
Portugal from 1926 to 1974, Macedo was arrested eight times on
political charges.
   He was a founding member of the then-clandestine Socialist Party
in the early 1970s, and represented northern Oporto as a deputy
after Portugal returned to democracy in 1974.
   Portuguese President Mario Soares praised Macedo as ``a good and
generous man ... who fought for liberty and democracy.''

<HEAD>HUD To Reopen Investigation Into Long Island Housing Program</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs graf 2, HUD Secretary, to CORRECT name to McGann.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM I. MILLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development
has re-opened an investigation into a program in which federally
subsidized housing in Island Park, N.Y., allegedly was steered to
white residents with political connections.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp announced the probe Thursday in the wake
of a news report in which the former Island Park town clerk said he
had misled HUD inspectors five years ago and covered up for
Geraldine McGann, a village board member and high-ranking HUD
official.
   Mrs. McGann, who last year became HUD's Region II administrator,
has taken a paid leave from her $68,500-a-year job, Kemp said
Thursday.
   Her son, Daniel McGann, was among those selected to purchase a
$44,500 house in the program, according to a 1984 HUD audit. His
application was not numbered or date-stamped and he was not married
at the time, the audit noted. Single people generally were not
eligible for the program, and the village had rejected other
singles, according to The New York Times.
   Mrs. McGann could not be reached for comment Thursday. A woman
answering the phone in her office said Mrs. McGann would not be at
work.
   The new investigation was triggered by a Times story saying
officials in Island Park, a predominantly white Long Island village
_ which is also the hometown of Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato _
had distributed federally subsidized homes to people with political
connections and excluded blacks. The Times based its story in part
on the HUD audit, which covered 1980 to 1984.
   Kemp also announced that from now on, no high-level HUD employee
may serve on state or local government boards, agencies or panels,
and no HUD employee at any level may serve on any such body that
does business with the department.
   D'Amato's cousin, Anthony Ciccimarro, also benefitted from Island
Park's HUD program, paying $40,000 for one of the subsidized houses,
according to the 1984 audit.
   On Thursday, D'Amato denied any involvement, and termed the
program ``excellent.''
   ``I know of no abuse and I know of no preferential treatment,''
D'Amato said at a news conference in his Capitol Hill offices. ``I
wrote no applications nor made any applications on (people's)
behalf. Had they asked me I would have. I thought the program was a
good program.''

<HEAD>Appeals Court Awards $72,875 to Former Labor Secretary Donovan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court today awarded $72,875
in attorneys' fees and expenses to former Labor Secretary Raymond
Donovan following an investigation into his activities as a
construction company executive.
   Donovan had sought more than $112,000, but the three-member court
panel lowered that figure by nearly $40,000.
   A court order said there was insufficient documentation for some
of the legal fees and that services provided by lawyers for the two
firms representing Donovan were in some cases duplicative.
   The criminal investigation by independent counsel Leon Silverman
was closed after insufficient credible evidence was found to warrant
prosecution.
   Retaining lawyers from two firms was ``excessive and therefore an
unreasonable expenditure,'' said the court panel headed by appeals
Judge George MacKinnon. ``The court cannot see any reason why one
firm could not have handled the entire case.'' Lawyers representing
Donovan were from Pierson, Ball &amp; Dowd in Washington and Kaye,
Scholer, Fierman, Hays &amp; Handler in New York.
   Silverman investigated the possibility in 1987 and 1988 that
Donovan may have lied to Congress and a grand jury about an alleged
kickback scheme on a New York City subway construction project in
1976 and 1977.
   The allegation was that Donovan, as vice president of Schiavone
Construction Co., demanded and received a kickback from Columbian
Steel Co. The principal witness against Donovan was Gerald Meyer,
the president and co-owner of Columbian, which brokered steel for
the construction project.
   The 1978 Ethics in Government Act provides for reimbursement of
attorneys' fees for the unindicted subject of an independent
counsel's investigation.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Rouses Masses for Khomeini Successor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX EFTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani on
Friday turned a memorial service for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
into a mass rally for his successor.
   The speaker has moved this week to bolster the reputation of
President Ali Khamenei, who was picked to succeed Khomeini as
supreme political and religious leader. Rafsanjani and Khamenei are
considered moderates.
   During his sermon at the Friday prayer service at Tehran
University, Rafsanjani said Khamenei met the conditions Khomeini
outlined for his successor.
   ``Obeying Khamenei is obeying Khomeini,'' chanted the crowd of
hundreds of thousands who packed the campus and surrounding streets
for miles. Families knelt on prayer mats in the streets.
   The appointment of Khamenei, only a middle-ranking cleric, was
initially viewed as temporary. However, Rafsanjani said Thursday it
was permanent.
   During Friday's memorial, Rafsanjani and other leaders sat
cross-legged on carpets next to the rostrum, which held a color
portrait of Khomeini. Four little boys knelt below the picture,
holding bunches of red and white gladiolas.
   Khamenei did not attend the service.
   While he spoke, Rafsanjani clutched the barrel of an AK-47
assault rifle, as he usually does at the Friday prayer service. The
gun symbolizes the determination of Iran to fight its enemies.
   The speaker said Khomeini, although he did not name a successor,
had hinted that Khamenei was qualified.
   He said Khomeini, who died of a heart attack Saturday at age 86,
wrote that his successor need not be a marja', or supreme religous
leader, even though the constitution says so.
   Khomeini had given permission many times for officials to
overlook the constitution, Rafsanjani said, adding, ``We all accept
that leadership is above the constitution.''
   He asked who was more qualified to run the country: ``He who is
more skilled in social, economic, cultural and political issues ...
or he who is in the theological school?''
   Khamenei, 49, was selected to succeed Khomeini on Sunday by the
Assembly of Experts. Khomeini had formed the 83-member group to
handle his succession.
   Iranian press reports have started calling Khamenei an ayatollah,
a title reserved for the highest religious leaders.
   In another sign of Khamenei's rising fortunes, the official
Islamic Republic News Agency announced that Iran's military
commanders met with him Thursday to declare their allegiance.
   Also on Thursday, Rafsanjani signaled his own intention of
playing a bigger political role, telling foreign reporters he wants
more executive power for the presidency.
   Rafsanjani, 55, is the only declared candidate in the Aug. 18
presidential election.
   Khamenei's second term as president expires in October and the
constitution bars him from running again.
   Iranian moderates such as Rafsanjani seek to end the country's
international isolation and boost private enterprise. Radicals
hardliners favor a self-reliant fundamentalist Iran.

<HEAD>Transcript Shows Crew In Fatal Corporate Jet Crash Discussed Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The cockpit voice recorder from a Southern Co.
airplane that crashed in April shows the crew knew the plane was on
fire, but investigators said today that their effort to explain the
fatal crash has not progressed far enough to draw any conclusions.
   An executive of the Atlanta-based company who was facing possible
dismissal and two company pilots were killed in the April 10 crash
minutes after takeoff from Pensacola, Fla.
   The transcript released today showed that the crew and passenger
realized there was a fire in the back of the Atlanta-bound plane a
little more than a minute before it crashed into an apartment
complex. No one on the ground was injured.
   National Transportation Safety Board officials who released the
transcript emphasized that their investigation is continuing and
refused to say if sabotage is suspected.
   ``We're not ruling anything out at this point,'' said Walter G.
Stiner, an NTSB air safety investigator. ``We're not ruling anything
in, either.''
   Jake Horton, the Southern Co. executive killed in the crash, had
recently been told before that he could be fired or suspended
because of alleged accounting improprieties uncovered in a company
audit. He was senior vice president of Southern subsidiary Gulf
Power Co.
   The crash occurred as a federal grand jury in Atlanta was
continuing an investigation, begun last August, into alleged tax law
violations and political contributions by Southern and its
subsidiaries.
   An attorney who met with Horton shortly before the plane crash
later testified before the grand jury.
   The actual tape was not played at today's news conference in
Atlanta, but NTSB Regional Director Jay Golden said there was no
``violence'' in the voices of the plane's occupants.
   ``There was no violence, no screaming, no accusations,'' he said.
   Golden said the investigation, which involves a number of federal
and Florida authorities as well as Southern Co., is continuing.
Though the FBI is involved, the investigation is not considered a
criminal one at this point, he said.
   According to the transcript, the fire was detected about 1 p.m.
on April 10. A unidentified voice said at that point, ``Oh.'' The
co-pilot said, ``What the hell was that?'' And Horton responded,
``Fire.''
   Immediately following that exchange, the transcript indicates the
crew tried to reduce pressure in the cockpit and to radio for help.
The recording ended abruptly less than 1{ minutes after the
conversation began, the transcript said.
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, an NTSB spokesman in Washington, said the
agency was required to release the transcript within 60 days of the
crash, but he added, ``There's no indication that this (the release)
changes the status of the investigation.''
   Southern Co. is the parent company of Alabama Power, Georgia
Power, Gulf Power, Mississippi Power and the Savannah Electric and
Power Co.
   The NTSB said last month its investigation at that point had
determined that engine failure did not cause the crash. It said the
continuing probe included an attempt to pinpoint the source of the
fire.

<HEAD>Senate-Passed Bill Would Aid Agent Orange Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate-passed bill would prevent disabled
Vietnam veterans and their survivors from losing federal public
assistance benefits if they get settlement payments from makers of
Agent Orange.
   ``With the passage of this measure, veterans will not have to
choose between the assistance payments to which they are entitled
and the pitiful compensation they will be granted for their Agent
Orange exposure,'' Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., sponsor of the
legislation, said Friday.
   The Senate passed the measure late Thursday.
   A companion measure in the House, introduced by Rep. George
Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., has been referred to the Government
Operations Committee, said Hochbrueckner's spokesman, Peter Coogan.
   Without this change in law, many veterans would become ineligible
for benefits such as housing assistance, Supplemental Security
Income and food stamps because the Agent Orange settlement payments
would push them over qualifying-income levels.
   In 1984, the manufacturers of Agent Orange agreed to put up $180
million to settle all claims while admitting no liability for
injuries or deaths caused by the chemical defoliant. The agreement
was approved by the U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, N.Y., in July
1988.
   To be eligible for payments, a veteran must be totally disabled,
show exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam and prove the disability
was not caused by anything else.
   Based on court estimates, the average payment per veteran will be
$5,700 over a six-year distribution period, or about $950 a year. Of
the 250,000 veterans who have filed preliminary claims, as many as
60,000 may be eligible. Though distribution of payments began in
March, provisions of the bill passed Thursday are retroactive.
   ``Without this law, veterans who have sacrificed much or all
would have lost the help they or their survivors should most
deservedly receive,'' Moynihan said.

<HEAD>Sacramento Buys Northwest Electricity After Nuclear Plant Closed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEWICK, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bonneville Power Administration today
began supplying electricity to Sacramento, Calif., where voters this
week shut down the Rancho Seco nuclear power plant.
   The Sacramento Municipal Utility District asked to buy 350
megawatts _ enough electricity to supply Tacoma _ from the
Northwest, said Sharon Blair, a spokeswoman for the federal power
agency.
   She said it's not known how long Sacramento will buy Bonneville
power because the city is still trying to figure out how to cope
with loss of the 15-year-old nuclear plant.
   BPA power is available because of high spring river runoff, but
the utility could not promise to keep Sacramento supplied over the
long run, Ms. Blair said.
   ``They could be cut anytime if we don't have it. This does not
affect our surplus at all,'' she said.
   BPA has a surplus of 400 megawatts it can guarantee to utilities,
and Sacramento is not buying any of that power, she said, adding
that the sale will have a negligible impact on BPA rates.
   SMUD is paying 1.7 cents a kilowatt hour, less than the BPA
wholesale rate of 2.4 cents for guaranteed power.
   The Sacramento district also is buying power from elsewhere in
California, and small amounts from Portland, Ore.-based Pacific
Power and Light, a private utility, said Wally Gibson, rate director
for the Northwest Power Planning Council.
   In Tuesday's election, 53.4 percent of Sacramento voters favored
closing Rancho Seco, which has been plagued by shutdowns and soaring
costs. The public utility's board members had agreed in advance to
shut the plant if voters taking part in the advisory referendum
wanted it shut.
   The plant averaged just 39 percent of capacity over its 15-year
life, although managers contended operations were improving.

   Lee A. Iacocca unveiled the design for a 755-foot
wall of names to be built on Ellis Island as ``a way to
personalize'' the immigration museum opening there next spring.
   The American Immigrant Wall of Honor will run along the entire
east side of the island, just outside the museum. About 90,000 names
have been registered for inscription, said Iacocca, chairman
emeritus of the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation.
   Applications will be accepted until Aug. 1, and officials expect
about 100,000 names will be engraved alphabetically on the $670,000
wall, he said at a news conference Thursday.
   ``The wall will pay tribute to all Americans, not just those who
came through Ellis Island,'' he said. Anyone can have a name
engraved on the wall, whether that person came through Ellis Island
or not, with a minimum donation of $100 per name.
   The foundation has raised $327 million in private donations to
restore the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, which Iacocca called
``the largest restoration in the history of man.''

   An Athens court on Friday granted Premier
Andreas Papandreou a divorce, ending his 38-year marriage to his
American-born wife, Margaret, a court spokesman said.
   The court issued the divorce on the basis of a suit Papandreou
filed on March 30 saying the couple had been separated for at least
four years, the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The 70-year-old Papandreou has been living with former airline
hostess Dimitra Liani, 35, since October.
   Papandreou married the former Margaret Chant, 66, of Elmhurst,
Ill., in 1951. They have four children.
   Mrs. Papandreou played an active role in the country's political
life. For many years she was the leader of the Greek Womens Union,
the largest feminist group in Greece, until she resigned earlier
this year.
   She resigned after Papandreou's ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement pressured her to give up her prominent role in the feminist
movement for fear she would undermine her husband's re-election
efforts. At the time, Ms. Liani had replaced her as the premier's
companion.
   Greek newspapers have speculated that he may marry Ms. Liani next
Sunday, one week before the June 18 general elections.

   A mink coat once owned by Eleanor Roosevelt _
about the time Richard M. Nixon was bragging about his wife's
Republican cloth coat _ was eagerly bought up Friday at a Democratic
women's club bazaar for $530.
   The three-quarter length brown mink, bearing an elegant ``ER''
monogram on its black lining, was donated to the fund-raising bazaar
at the Woman's National Democratic Club by the late first lady's
granddaughter, Eleanor R. Seagraves, a club member.
   The coat's new owner is Doris Foster, a longtime party
contributor and former volunteer for the Adlai Stevenson and Hubert
Humphrey presidential campaigns who said she has always admired
Eleanor Roosevelt for her liberal principles.
   ``She's been an idol of mine all my life,'' said Mrs. Foster, who
beat everyone else to the coat rack and snatched up the Roosevelt
mink as soon as the club's doors opened at 10 a.m. EDT.
   After paying $500 plus $30 tax, the wife of retired State
Department official Schuyler Foster happily modeled the coat and
posed for her picture-taking fellow shoppers.
   Mrs. Seagraves said she believed her grandmother bought the mink
in the 1950s while she was living in Manhattan, after the death of
her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, in 1945.
   About the time Mrs. Roosevelt purchased the mink, Nixon made his
famous ``Checkers speech'' in September 1952 in response to charges
that he was the beneficiary of a secret Republican slush fund.
Nixon's televised defense was credited with keeping him on the GOP
ticket as Dwight D. Eisenhower's vice presidential running mate.
   During the speech, Nixon said at one point: ``I should say this,
that Pat doesn't have a mink coat, but she does have a respectable
Republican cloth coat.''
   Mrs. Seagraves said she inherited her grandmother's mink from her
mother, Anna, the oldest of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt's six
children and their only daughter, who died in 1975.
   Mrs. Seagraves, 62, wife of a Washington newsletter publisher,
said she kept the coat in her bedroom closet along with another,
full-length mink that also belonged to her namesake, but she never
wore either one.
   ``I don't wear furs,'' she said. ``They are not my style. But if
it can be used by someone who is devoted to ER, it should be.''
   Mrs. Foster said she would wear her new mink ``on very choice
occasions'' and eventually would donate it to the Eleanor Roosevelt
museum at Val-Kill, the former first lady's home at Hyde Park, N.Y.
   ``Mrs. Roosevelt was the role model for my generation and for
every generation since,'' Mrs. Foster said. ``The principles she
stood for _ Social Security, the minimum wage, housing and human
rights _ are what I want to see carried out.''

<HEAD>State Sues Contractor Over Thruway Bridge Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state is suing contractors who designed
and built the New York Thruway bridge that collapsed and killed 10
people in April 1987.
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in a state court by the state
Attorney General's office, asks nearly $115 million from Perini
Corp. of Framingham, Mass.; Madigan Hyland Consulting Engineers of
New York City; U.R.S. Corp. of San Mateo Calif.; and U.R.S.
Consultants of New York City.
   The lawsuit also names Clinton Lloyd, the surviving partner of
Madigan Hyland, state officials said Friday. Perini was the original
contractor for the bridge built 35 years ago.
   The state Thruway Authority is seeking $43.7 million for loss of
the bridge, replacement costs, revenue loss and other costs. The
state is asking an additional $71.2 million to cover claims from the
families of the people killed when the bridge collapsed into the
rain-swollen Schoharie Creek.
   The lawsuit claims the contractors failed to install boulders,
stones or concrete to reinforce the footings of the bridge piers.
   A statement by Perini cited a 1988 National Transportation Safety
Board report that pinned the probable cause of the accident on the
Thruway Authority's failure to properly maintain and replace the
supporting stones, known as riprap.

   The FBI affidavit that triggered this week's
federal raid of Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant was unsealed
today, and it reveals allegations of illegal discharge of pollutants
into a creek and unpermitted dumping of hazardous wastes.
   U.S. Magistrate Hilbert Schauer unsealed the affidavit after the
Rocky Mountain News challenged the withholding of the information
that led Schauer issue a search warrant for the facility 16 miles
northwest of Denver.
   The 116-page affidavit catalogues the allegations made by FBI
agent Jon Lipsky and indicates the investigation will probe
activities as the nuclear weapons plant going back to November 1980.
   Among other things, the affidavit alleges up to 40 hazardous or
mixed wastes are sent to on-site facilities that do not have
disposal permits; that hazardous and mixed wastes are being burned
in an unpermitted incinerator; and that last November, Rocky Flats
illegally discharged pollutants into Walnut Creek without a permit.
   The affidavit also questions the DOE's decision to award an $8.6
million bonus to Rockwell International Corp. for excellent
management of Rocky Flats.
   The Rocky Mountain News reported today that the General
Accounting Office also has launched an investigation of performance
bonuses awarded Rocky Flats' managers.
   On Tuesday, 75 FBI and Environmental Protection Agency agents
raided the facility to investigate alleged criminal violations of
hazardous waste laws. On Wednesday, the Colorado Department of
Health announced it had found 25 environmental violations at the
plant.
   FBI agents were expected to continue their investigation for the
Justice Department at least through next week, said Bob Pence, agent
in charge of the Colorado FBI office. They are investigating whether
hazardous waste was illegally disposed of at the plant and the
actions then covered up.
   The GAO investigation of the bonus program at Rocky Flats and
other weapons plants is expected to be completed in about two
months, Carl Bannerman, assistant director of the GAO's energy
division in Washington, D.C., was quoted as saying in the Rocky
Mountain News. The newspaper did not say when the investigation
began.
   The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress.
   Rockwell International Corp. has operated Rocky Flats, which
manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons, for the
Department of Energy since 1975. The plant also recycles plutonium
for use in making the triggers.
   The bonuses _ known as ``award fees'' _ are based on performance
in six weighted categories. At Rocky Flats, those categories are
general management, 25 percent; environmental health and safety, 20
percent; cost management, 15 percent; quality control, 15 percent;
production operations, 15 percent; and waste management, 10 percent.
The Energy Department rates the plant's performance in those
categories.
   Defense contractors can earn additional bonuses by meeting or
surpassing production goals.
   Records show that bonuses paid to Rockwell for its Rocky Flats
performance have totaled more than $41.6 million since 1981. Bonuses
for 1988 totaled $9.4 million.
   Rockwell, in turn, awards some of the bonus money to top
management officials at Rocky Flats as a reward for reaching
perfomance goals, said Rockwell spokesman Ed Heintz.
   Last year, Rockwell lost part of its $9.4 million bonus after the
Energy Department found some employees in a shop at the plant had
spent working time making gifts and trinkets for personal use.
   Much of the FBI investigation at the plant focuses on allegations
of illegal waste disposal, water pollution violations and falsifying
records, particularly on the possible improper use of an incinerator
designed to remove valuable radioactive plutonium from contaminated
debris.

   Any suggestion that the crew of the Starship

warp speed brings a phaser stare from the man who plays Capt. James

Frontier.''
   Shatner said he keeps cool when people point out lines on his
face or that he doesn't have the same jaw line of 25 years ago.
   ``But what does make me angry is when some jerk keeps talking
about this age thing, like we've gotten too old to entertain people

don't think I look too old to get up and hit some guy in a movie.''

   Princess Diana works too hard, her father says.
   Earl Spencer spoke to reporters after accompanying his daughter
in heavy rain Thursday in central England where the princess was
made an honorary Freeman of Northampton.
   ``I am worried that she is working too hard. In my day the royals
only did one job a day and she sometimes does two or three,'' the
earl, 65, said of his 27-year-old daughter, wife of Prince Charles,

<HEAD>Bush Administration Denounces Government `Murder' of Chinese Citizens</HEAD>

   The Bush administration, saying the Chinese
government has ``murdered many, many of its citizens,'' on Friday
denounced calls for reprisals against the pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   The administration also said the reappearance of Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping in public does not settle the question of who bears
responsibility for ordering last weekend's bloody crackdown on
civilians in Tiananmen Square.
   ``You can watch television and see who the government is, but in
terms of individual actions and motivations ... we don't know,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But he added that ``I don't think anyone doubts'' that Deng and
Prime Minister Li Peng are now in charge of the overall government
in Beijing.
   President Bush is still waiting for Deng to return a phone call
the U.S. leader made to no avail on Thursday.
   ``The phone call remains placed and we'll see if he returns our
call,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Deng appeared in public Friday for the first time since May 16 to
attend a ceremony at which he saluted military leaders for carrying
out the crackdown on the ``counter-revolutionaries.''
   Fitzwater used some of the strongest language yet to express U.S.
condemnation of the military actions that claimed hundreds and
possibly thousands of lives last weekend.
   ``Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its
citizens. We have had an incredible upheaval in (that) country,''
said Fitzwater. ``Things are not going back to normal soon or in a
quick fashion.''
   The violence will affect China's ``relations with all countries
of the world for a considerable period of time,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``The government has killed people there, their own citizens, and
now we see reprisals being announced over the loudspeakers in the
public squares. Reprisals are repugnant. We certainly watch this
situation with grave concern,'' said Fitzwater, citing ``the
loudspeaker calls for neighbors to call in neighbors, the public
calls for reprisals against students who met with Li Peng.''
   Bush suspended military sales to China on Monday but has
refrained from economic sanctions, saying he does not want to cause
hardship for the Chinese people.
   ``We remain prepared to take any action that we feel will be
beneficial to the situation, but we're not willing to speculate in
advance on what we might do,'' he said.
   Fitzwater said violence in the streets of China appears to be
calming down. But he said the situation remains clouded, with the
United States still in the dark ``with regard to our knowledge of
the structure or command responsibility of the leadership.''
   Bush, whose personal ties with the Chinese leadership date back
to his service as U.S. envoy to China in 1974-75, said Thursday it
would be ``extraordinarily difficult'' to have ties with anyone
responsible for the bloodshed.
   Bush said he wants to preserve the U.S.-Chinese relationship, but
``it will take a recognition of the rights of individuals and
respect for the rights of those who disagree.''
   ``We aren't going to remake the world but we should stand for
something. And there's no question in the minds of these students
(in China) that the United States is standing in their corners,''
the president said.

   A Cabinet minister who was the
new president's closest adviser was killed today by unidentified men
who riddled his car with machine gun fire, the governing political
party said.
   Jose Antonio Rodriguez, 70, the minister of the presidency, died
shortly after arriving at the Zaldivar Hospital, said a nurse who
demanded anonymity.
   Rodriguez, the chief of staff, was a member of the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance of President Alfredo Cristiani, who
took office June 1.
   Rodriguez's driver and bodyguard also died in the attack, which
occurred shortly after the minister left his home in western San
Salvador, according to Armando Calderon Sol, president of the
governing party, and police sources.
   People who witnessed the attack told The Associated Press it
occurred in front of the minister's house, before his car had been
started. Five or six shots were heard, said the witnesses, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Leaders of the governing party, known as Arena, blamed the attack
on leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, who have waged a 9-year-old war to overthrow U.S.-supported
governments in El Salvador.
   But no group immediately claimed responsibility.
   ``A man who has defended the law has died,'' Calderon told
reporters outside the hospital where Rodriguez was taken. Another
Arena leader, Col. Sigifredo Ochoa Perez, said: ``We are confronting
brazen terrorism, commanders and communists who are here with the
protection of the law.''
   ``They are troglodytes and the only way to make them understand
is to fight fire with fire ... We can't continue to stand with our
arms folded,'' he said.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said, ``We condemn this outrage and call for an end to violence in
El Salvador.
   ``Attacks such as this are designed to provoke a violent reaction
by the goverment of El Salvador and its military and security
forces, who continue to demonstrate restraint in the face of ongoing
terrorist provocations.''
   Rodriguez took office June 1, the day Cristiani was inaugurated
for a five-year term. Leftist guerrillas, who tried to disrupt the
election that brought Cristiani to power, vowed before the
inauguration to make El Salvador ``ungovernable.''
   On Saturday, the guerrillas spurned Cristiani's proposal for
dialogue aimed at ending the nation's civil war. An estimated 70,000
people, most of them civilians, have been killed since the civil war
began.
   On Wednesday, guerrillas attacked nine military posts and claimed
to have killed or wounded six police in a raid on a coffee
processing plant at San Miguel de Mercedes, 50 miles north of the
capital in Chalatenango province.

   Workers are unfurling hundreds of
yards of checkered tablecloths as the cereal city prepares to
reclaim bragging rights to the World's Largest Breakfast Table.
   Organizers of the 1989 Cereal Festival plan to serve breakfast to
35,000 people in three-and-a-half hours Saturday to topple a record
set by rival Springfield, Mass., last month.
   ``We'll have ready-to-eat cereal and milk, of course,'' Rick
Royal, co-chairman of the festival, said Thursday.
   Battle Creek is home to Kellogg Co., as well as the Post division
of General Foods and Ralston-Purina, all makers of several varieties
of cereals.
   The 2,500-foot table spans five city blocks, Royal said.
   Battle Creek held the first free cereal breakfast in 1956 to
celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of Kellogg.
   The first taste of competition was in 1977, when Springfield held
a breakfast and fed 11,000 as part of its founders day.
   It's been heated competition ever since.
   Last year, Battle Creek fed 32,697 people to beat Springfield,
which served pancakes to 31,279.
   On May 13, Springfield upped the ante by serving 33,869 people.
   ``There are a few bets involved,'' Royal said. ``But what's
really at stake is a lot of pride. We want the title, but we'll
always be the cereal capital of the World.''
   The cereals are donated by the companies.

   Rebels attacked the country's most
important hydroelectric plant with mortar fire, blacking out the
northern city of Jinotega and surrounding towns, government radio
said today.
   The Central America plant, north of Jinotega, was damaged in the
attack late Thursday night and an undetermined number of people were
wounded, the Voice of Nicaragua broadcast said.
   It quoted the Defense Ministry as saying that the attack occurred
at 11:35 p.m. and that no other information was immediately
available.
   Sources in Jinotega, 100 miles north of Managua, told The
Associated Press the rebels, who are known as Contras, also blew up
electrical poles along the road between the city and the plant. A
spokesman for the Nicaraguan Energy Institute said power was
restored to the area at 9 a.m. today.
   The U.S.-backed rebels and the Sandinista government signed a
temporary cease-fire in March 1988, but efforts to extend the accord
into a permanent truce fell through in September. The government has
extended the cease-fire unilaterally on a monthly basis but sporadic
attacks have continued.

   The last time Nazgi Mir Vagir-Zade saw her father,
he was in a frightened crowd of people looking for a way to flee the
mob that set fire to their homes.
   The next day, she said her fear of the rampaging mobs caused her
to suffer a miscarriage. But after two days in the hospital she fled
to Moscow from the Fergana Valley of Uzbekistan to save herself and
her 22-month-old son Ali.
   Mrs. Vagir-Zade was one of the people caught up in violence that
swept the Central Asian republic of Uzbekistan.
   Her husband, an engineer, insisted on staying behind Tuesday to
look for her father and older brother. But there has been no further
word from the family in the fertile valley 1,500 miles southeast of
Moscow.
   Communications are cut off.
   On Friday, a week after the rioting reached her hometown Fergana,
the 31-year-old teacher placed a black lace scarf of mourning around
her shoulders and joined 100 other Meskhi Turks pleading at a Moscow
government office for a meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to stop the bloodshed.
   Gorbachev was wrapping up the first session of the Congress of
People's Deputies at the Kremlin, and by late afternoon there had
been no meeting.
   The Meskhi Turks were not surprised. They said it was the 146th
delegation they've sent to Moscow since 1957. They said they've seen
no results.
   The Turks say overcrowding and economic frustrations have raised
tensions among Uzbeks and Meskhi Turks, who were exiled to the
region from their native Georgia by Stalin in 1944.
   Mrs. Vagir-Zade didn't know whether her father or her older
brother are among the 80 dead.
   Seated in a small downtown Moscow park on Friday, she related her
experiences in an emotional but steady voice.
   Homes built by the Turks when they were exiled ``are all burned
down,'' she said. The crowd that included her father gathered Sunday
in downtown Fergana not knowing how to protect themselves. ``The
people were all afraid, and no one knew where to run, what to do.''
   The next day, ``I ended up in the maternity hospital because of
my fear, and I had a miscarriage. I lost a 3-month-old child,'' she
said. ``When I wanted to leave, not one Uzbek taxi driver would pick
me up. A Russian man stopped for me in his private car.''
   ``We don't have anywhere to go. The Uzbeks want to clean us out
and in Georgia, our homeland, they don't want us,'' she said.
   The late dictator Josef Stalin forced the Turks to move to
Uzbekistan from Soviet Georgia in 1944.
   ``I still don't know where my father and older brother are, what
has happened to them,'' she said.
   Another brother, two sisters-in-law, nieces and nephews are among
about 10,000 Meskhi Turks now living in open-air camps protected by
some of the 9,000 Interior Ministry soldiers sent to the region to
restore order.
   When the rioting started, ethnic Uzbeks began hanging red rags or
cloths from their houses to ensure that the mobs could distinguish
them, she said.
   Rioters, mostly young people armed with knives, gasoline bombs,
clubs and some firearms, split into bands of a few hundred and
terrorized neighborhoods and whole cities, she said.
   Local authorities didn't try to stop the violence, she charged.
   Some Uzbeks risked their lives to protect friends.
   Mrs. Vagir-Zade said her own house was still standing when she
left because her neighbors convinced rioters that Uzbeks lived
there. ``But I can't chance having our neighbors risk their lives
and their children for us,'' she added. ``So I decided to take my
baby to Moscow.''
   Karib Aliev, a Meskhi Turk from Frunze, Kirghizia, 250 miles
northeast of the Fergana Valley, said the small valley of cotton and
grapes was peaceful for decades until it filled up with people and
the economy went sour.
   ``As soon as the economic situation got bad, they began to demand
that we be sent back,'' he said.
   The valley is home to 2.5 million people. ``There is no longer
any land to build a house, not enough work, and the economic
situation has gotten worse,'' he said.
   Mrs. Vagir-Zade, reflecting on the future, said it was impossible
to go back to Fergana and start over there.
   ``My mother died last year, and I think she was a lot luckier
than us, because she didn't see this,'' she said.

<HEAD>Congressional Budget Office Says Bush Plan Could Save $2 Billion
Annually</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal to reduce military
forces in Europe both for the NATO alliance and Warsaw Pact nations
could amount to about $2 billion a year in savings for the United
States, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
   The office's analysis, released this week, found that the
president's offer would result in about $1 billion in savings from
reductions in pay and allowances for troops stationed overseas with
the remaining windfall the result of lower day-to-day operating
costs.
   Bush's proposal calls for removing 30,000 U.S. troops and 325,000
Soviet soldiers from Europe and reductions in the number of NATO
combat aircraft by 750 and Warsaw Pact planes by 3,000.
   The president introduced his arms control initiatives placing
ceilings on troops, tanks, combat aircraft and attack helicopters,
artillery and armored personnel carriers last month at the 40th
anniversary of NATO. The proposal refines what the alliance put on
the bargaining table in Vienna in March.
   Under Bush's proposal, a conventional arms treaty would be
negotiated within six months to a year. The budget office analysis
said that under that schedule, ``savings would not begin until 1991
at the earliest, and full savings would probably not be realized
until at least 1993.''
   The costs are based on 1990 dollars in budget authority, the
office said.
   The analysis also said that the proposal might also allow the
Pentagon to avoid the need to buy about $6 billion in new weapons.
The savings, however, would likely come over many years and only if
the procurement rate for new weapons is reduced.
   If Bush decides that reductions in the Warsaw Pact forces means
less of a threat and choses to maintain a smaller or less-modern
military, ``such a decision could result in reductions in the
defense budget much larger than those estimated in this paper,'' the
office said.
   However, the budget office, which conducted its analysis at the
request of the Senate Budget Committee, said the savings could be
less if Bush decides cuts in forces in Europe require a greater
number of forces in the United States or increases in the number of
ships or aircraft to carry weapons and cargo to Europe.
   Cost of verification also could cut into the net savings, the
office said.
   Bush did not specify which U.S. forces would be removed to
achieve the reductions, but the budget office suggested possible
steps to realize the savings. Among the office's suggestions was
withdrawal of one armored or mechanized division, including all its
helicopters and artillery. An armored or mechanized division
includes three brigades with about 17,000 personnel.
   Such as step would require removing about 26,000 Army personnel
from Europe. In addition, the United States could withdraw one and
one-third of a tactical wing of F-16 fighter aircraft. About 4,000
personnel are attached to a wing.
   The United States could see a one-time saving if Bush decides
against construction of new base in Crotone, Italy, to house the
401st Tactical Fighter Wing of F-16 fighters and the approximately
3,600 U.S. troops and 600 civilians.
   Estimated cost to build the new base is $830 million for the NATO
allies with the United States expected to pay about $26 million. The
U.S. expense does not include $180 million for housing over 10 years.
   Last year, Italy agreed to provide a new home for the wing after
Spain demanded that it leave the base at Torrejon de Ardoz, just
east of Madrid.
   However, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told NATO allies in
Brussels, Belgium, Friday that Bush proposals on reductions in
combat aircraft exclude the 72 F-16 of the 401st Tactical Wing.

<HEAD>Botha's Decision to Extend State of Emergency Disappoints Senators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifty-seven senators expressed disappointment
Friday at the decision of South African President P. W. Botha to
extend his nation's ``state-of-emergency'' rule for another year.
   The senators, 38 Democrats and 19 Republicans, told Botha in a
telegram: ``A peaceful end to apartheid will only be possible if
political and human rights are respected in South Africa.''
   Signers of the telegram include Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, R-Kan., ranking GOP member of the
Senate Foreign Relations African affairs subcommittee, helped
organize the message to Botha.
   ``Since the state of emergency was imposed three years ago, the
South African government has sharply restricted the activities of 34
black political organizations, detained more than 30,000 people, and
silenced political dissent with stringent press censorship,'' Mrs.
Kassebaum said in a statement.
   ``It is critical that South Africa begin the process toward
peaceful national reconciliation through negotiation,'' she said.
``Unfortunately, another year under the state of emergency makes
that process very difficult.''
   Botha said in a statement that by applying the emergency measures
his government ``succeeded in stopping the widespread violence by
radicals.''
   But he said it was necessary to extend the decree despite a sharp
decline in political violence over the past year because black
revolutionaries continue plots aimed at undermining his white-led
government.

<HEAD>USDA: Farm Population Down But Actual Farmers Holding Steady</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of people living on the nation's
farms has been declining for years, says the Agriculture Department.
   On the other hand, the ``farm entrepreneurial population'' of
people involved in the farming business may be holding its own, a
new USDA report showed Friday.
   In 1987, the report said, approximately 5.7 million people
``lived in households associated with the operation of farms'' in
the United States. That was up slightly from 5.6 million in 1986.
   However, the author of the report, economist Margaret A. Butler,
said the 1986 and 1987 numbers were ``not significantly changed.''
   A year ago, the USDA agency and the Census Bureau reported the
1987 ``farm population'' at just under 5 million, down from almost
5.3 million in 1986.
   Traditionally, the farm population has been defined as the number
of people living on farms and ranches, regardless of occupation or
income.
   But the report said that ``people who live on farms today are not
necessarily employed in agriculture, and those employed in
agriculture often do not live on farms.''
   So the new category of people who are actually involved in
farming _ based on current population surveys conducted annually by
the Census Bureau _ was devised.
   No attempt was made to indentify hired farm workers because
``many persons who do hired farm work have only a tenuous connection
with farming based on short-term seasonal work,'' the report said.
``The objective here is to define and characterize in its own right
the population of farmer households.''

   Charles Culhane, serving a 25-years-to-life
murder sentence for the fatal shooting of a county deputy sheriff 21
years ago, says he's getting married again next week.
   This time it may be legal.
   Culhane and Ann, a New Jersey social worker whose last name he
requested not be used, had a wedding ceremony a few years ago in the
visiting room at Sing Sing state prison. But under New York law,
lifers were considered civilly dead and not allowed to marry.
   Then last month, a federal judge in Syracuse overturned the New
York law, ruling that it was ``arbitrary and irrational.''
   ``The right to marry in a prison setting is a fundamental one,''
wrote U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn.
   ``We'll be getting married next Wednesday about noontime,''
Culhane said in a telephone interview this week from Woodbourne
state prison, a medium-security facility. ``I'm going to get in and
do it before someone decides to appeal.''
   State Corrections Commissioner Thomas Coughlin, who has been
lobbying the state Legislature for several years to repeal the law,
said he would not appeal McCurn's ruling.
   Also planning to wed soon are Richard Langone, 32, an inmate at
the Queensboro state prison, and Dari Schmall, 23, of New York City.
Langone said he wanted to keep the date private.
   Langone, having served more than 13 years of a 15-years-to-life
murder sentence for a drug-related shooting when he was 18, brought
the class-action lawsuit against the state.
   Langone, who is a friend of Culhane's, said he and Schmall met
when his mother brought her along for a prison visit in 1981. His
mother and Schmall's were best friends.
   ``At the end of 1983, we decided we wanted to marry,'' Langone
said in an interview this week. ``That was the first time I came up
against the law. I asked my mom if I could borrow $160. I told her I
had to take a course in constitutional law.''
   Langone took the law course, and a host of others, and challenged
the no-marriage law he felt ``punishes you in a perverted way.''
   ``Marriage is important for someone in prison. It makes a person
feel like he's got something,'' he said.
   Coughlin's office had no figures on whether other states have
laws similar to the one struck down in New York; Langone said he
thought about a dozen other states banned marriage for lifers.
   State Corrections Department officials say there are about 7,500
inmates serving life sentences. They are unsure how many are single.
Of the system's 47,000 inmates, about 20 percent are married.
   Since October, Langone has been in a work-release program that
allows him weekend furloughs with Schmall. She is expecting their
first child and he'll be eligible for parole in a year. He's working
for a criminal lawyer and hopes to attend law school after he's
paroled.
   Culhane, 44, doesn't know when he'll be getting out of prison. He
and Ann get to spend time together only in the prison visiting room
with other inmates and their families. Only married inmates are
allowed conjugal visits.
   Culhane, who has won several PEN writing awards for plays and
poetry written in prison, has appealed his murder conviction to New
York's highest court. He's awaiting word from the Court of Appeals
on whether it will hear his case and is expected to ask Gov. Mario
Cuomo for clemency.
   Without clemency, Culhane would become eligible for parole at the
end of 1991.

   Teams of club-wielding police officers rove the
streets. Soldiers with automatic weapons check identity papers at
all major intersections. Squads of them, toting flashlights, pedal
bicycles up alleyways.
   Night has fallen in Beijing.
   No curfew has been declared in the capital but bands of troops
who patrol this city after dark are effectively deterring anyone
from staying outside past 10 p.m. or gathering in a group larger
than five.
   During the day, a veneer of normal life is spreading across
Beijing. But when night falls, so does any pretense to calm and
safety.
   On Friday night, a convoy of troop trucks patrolled the streets
of the university district to the northwest for the first time
during the weeklong crackdown on the movement for democracy and
freedom.
   Small groups of students and local residents who had congregated
on the main streets fled as the convoy bore down on them.
   ``Here they come, let's get out of here,'' yelled one youth as
five trucks led by two police vans sped around a corner and flashed
their lights at a crowd.
   Soldiers, their AK-47 automatic rifles pointed into the crowd,
shouted at it to disperse.
   ``Go home, everybody,'' one officer barked. ``Go home.''
   The crowd that had been forming nightly in front of People's
University was not there Friday. Only a few outdoor food stands were
in front of the university's gates.
   ``Most of my classmates have gone home,'' said one student. He
said he was having trouble buying a train ticket to get out of town.
``I hope to be out, too, in about a week.''
   Soldiers stood on street corners near the campuses. A group of
seven blocked off a small street but students said troops had yet to
enter their schools.
   ``What we do have is plainclothes police,'' said one student.
``They are everywhere.''
   Indeed, security forces and university officials scrubbed the
posters calling for freedom from the walls of Beijing University.
Several daring students placed another poster up, but within minutes
it too was taken down.
   Posters also disappeared from in front of People's University and
Beijing Normal University. Only a handful of paper chrysanthemums, a
flower used in traditional Chinese wakes, remained at the gate of
one school.
   Troop concentrations increase near the center of the city, and
most major intersections are occupied by soldiers. At the crossing
next to the China Art Gallery, soldiers searched the bag of one
woman.
   Restaurants that had been staying open until 10:30 p.m. are
shutting at 8 p.m.
   ``Things are in chaos everywhere,'' said one proprietor. ``If I
stay open, these police hooligans may come and get me. It's best to
keep things locked up.''
   By 11 p.m. the streets were mostly empty, unusual for a balmy
night in late spring. During more peaceful times, families would be
sitting outside, catching fresh air and a respite from their airless
quarters down the alleyways.
   Bands of soldiers, their helmets and rifles glinting under the
streetlights, pedaled through the streets on bicycles. Soldiers
venture up alleys with flashlights.
   People moved hurriedly in the shadows, but in those shadows, too,
are detachments of troops, leaning up against walls, their weapons
slung across their backs.
   Entering the inner city, two reporters were stopped at two
intersections by police backed up by soldiers.
   All other vehicles were similarly stopped. Some were searched.
   Later in the evening, just after midnight, one of the largest
movements of tanks occurred on Changan Avenue, the city's main
boulevard.
   More than 70 tanks with more than 20 armored personnel carriers
moved out of the city center. Most pedestrians fled behind
buildings. A few stood under street lamps and watched the convoy.
   Afterward, little stirred in this city of 11 million.

   A truck driver and more than 2,200
watermelons were stranded when police impounded his 30-ton truck for
violating the 10-ton weight limit on a mountain road.
   Gary Grantham of Richmond, Ky., said he got lost on the way to a
Johnstown fruit distributor Thursday and ended up on the wrong road.
Police Cpl. John Smith impounded the truck and levied a $15,327 fine
against Grantham, who works for B&amp;M Trucking Co. in Richmond.
   When Grantham couldn't post bond Friday, officials lowered it to
$5,000, but he couldn't pay that either.
   Smith said when Grantham posted bond for the truck, he and the
watermelons would be free to leave town.
   ``I made an honest mistake,'' said Grantham, who was trying to
find a distributor or grocer to take the melons. ``I've got to get
those melons to Johnstown or they'll be ruined.''

   Twenty years after Neil A. Armstrong made his
``giant leap for mankind'' on the moon, he and his fellow Apollo 11
astronauts said Friday they are disappointed man has not taken even
one small step on Mars.
   ``I thought the moon would lead immediately and logically to
Mars,'' said Michael Collins, the astronaut who remained in the
spacecraft Columbia circling the moon while Armstrong and Edwin
``Buzz'' Aldrin set down on the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969.
   Millions of television viewers watched the heady culmination of a
bold challenge issued in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy to land
an American on the moon by the end of the decade.
   Speaking to a jammed news conference at the Paris Air Show, the
three gray-haired astronauts used the anniversary to renew the
challenge for Americans to expand the human presence in the solar
system.
   Also on Friday, Soviet pilot Anatoly Kvochur was discharged from
the hospital after being treated for injuries he suffered on
Thursday when he ejected from his MiG-29 fighter seconds before it
exploded at the air show.
   No one else was injured when the jet stalled during a performance
before reporters and exhibitors, and crashed in the center of the
field at Le Bourget airport. The cause was being investigated.
   At the news conference, Aldrin said it was competition from the
Soviet Union in the early 1960s that spawned the leap into space,
and that no similar urgency exists today.
   Armstrong, who commanded the Apollo 11 mission, said: ``We all
started much before 1969 and at the time, most people did not
believe there would ever be people in space in our lifetime. In that
sense I'm very encouraged that we did more than most people,
including myself, would have guessed 30 years ago.''
   ``Having said that and knowing now that we were able to break the
chains of gravity, those of us who are involved are always
disappointed that we are not doing more and doing more faster.''
   Collins added: ``I think of the moon not so much as a place these
days than as of a direction, a direction out there, a small way
station on the way to Mars or the outer planets beyond our solar
system.''
   In an interview earlier, Aldrin said NASA planners only recently
considered seriously a proposal he made in 1985 for a ``cycling
spaceship.''
   Two spaceships would orbit the sun in a two-year cycle, passing
Mars on the outbound leg and then circling back to Earth.
   The spaceships could serve as permanent transport to and from
Mars with ``stripped-down space ferries shuttling men and materials
back and forth to Earth,'' said Aldrin, whose book ``Men From
Earth'' was published in the United States last month.
   ``I hope the spaceships will become an increasingly pursued means
of getting to Mars,'' said Aldrin, who lives in Laguna Beach, Calif.
   ``I expect we'll be back on the moon by 2005 and then by 2010 we
should be sending people to Mars,'' he said.
   The three astronauts said they did not expect to set foot on
Mars, but that the moon still holds allure.
   ``I look forward to the day when there is commercial service and
I have a chance to go back,'' Armstrong said.

<HEAD>Designers of Plane That Was Pedaled Across English Channel Gather

<TEXT>
   The crew and builders of the Gossamer
Albatross, the first human-powered plane to fly across the English
Channel, plan to gather Saturday for a 10-year reunion of the
historic event.
   ``Just a get-together,'' explained Paul MacCready, the Monrovia
aeronautics engineer who designed the awkward-looking plane largely
held together with transparent tape.
   The private event is being held in a cavernous building where
Rose Bowl floats are assembled and the Gossamer Albatross II, a
backup of the original plane, is stored. The plane that made the
historic flight is displayed in the London Science Museum.
   Among the 60 or so crewmembers and their families planning to
attend is Bryan Allen, who was recruited for his skills as a pilot,
bicyclist and hang-glider to pedal the craft 23 miles from
Folkstone, England, to Cap Gris Nez, France, on June 12, 1979.
   Allen, now a 36-year-old computer software specialist for a
Pasadena firm, recalled the grueling two-hour, 49-minute flight as
``by far the most difficult thing I've ever done physically ... and,
I suppose, mentally.''
   Allen, flying the 70-pound craft just a few feet over the water,
battled cross winds, dehydration and fatigue before landing the
Gossamer Albatross on a beach, where crew members had to help him
stand up.
   ``By then, I didn't want to spend another tenth of a second in
the plane,'' he said.
   Despite the drama of the event, the flight turned out to have
little long-range practical application to aeronautic technology,
except for the use of a couple of materials now found on commercial
aircraft.
   ``Carbon filament and Kevlar, a compound used in some of the
control mechanisms, are sneaking their way into airlines,''
MacCready said.
   The $220,000 prize for the flight, put up by English
industrialist Henry Kremer, went to cover expenses.
   MacCready, 63, said the flight of the Gossamer Albatross was more
symbolic than anything, much like Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight
across the Atlantic.
   ``It helped change people's perceptions about how we can do more
with less,'' he said. ``We've reached an era of limits on Earth, so
it is really important.''

   E.T., phone home _ it won't cost you
anything from a Long Island Expressway rest stop near exit 52.
   New York Telephone on Thursday finally caught up with two dozen
``pay'' telephones that were operating free of charge and letting
those in the know call friends and relatives all over the world.
   Police alerted the phone company after a man who lived 50 miles
away was wounded at the rest stop in a hold-up attempt.
   When police asked the victim, Waseem Moosa of New York City, what
he was doing so far from home at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, he admitted he
had driven the distance to make a phone call to Pakistan.
   Skeptical officers returned to the area to look for witnesses to
the robbery, and discovered 15 Pakistani men using the phones.
Police then notified the phone company, which reprogrammed the
phones.
   ``It was a boo-boo, a human error in which somewhere down the
line the pay phones were not given a proper code with the main
computer in Commack,'' said phone company spokesman Bruce Reisman.
   Reisman guessed the calls were made throughout May, adding that
New York Telephone normally doesn't benefit from international
calls. Since the break-up of AT&amp;T in 1984, New York Telephone offers
only local service.
   AT&amp;T spokeswoman Laura Abbot said the incident was under
investigation, and that her company and New York Telephone will
determine which one will be stuck with the bill.
   Abbot could not say how many calls were made from the free phones
or how much they were worth.

<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mice given an AIDS virus gene developed an
AIDS-related cancer, suggesting the virus itself may cause cancer,
leading researcher Dr. Robert Gallo said Friday.
   Gallo, one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus, also said an
experimental AIDS drug called CD4 is the closest thing to a ``magic
bullet'' to eradicate AIDS.
   ``If CD4 doesn't work in the early phases, don't despair,'' he
said. The drug blocks the mechanism by which the AIDS virus attaches
to certain white blood cells and infects them.
   This mechanism is so critical to AIDS virus growth in the body
that some version of CD4 ought to be able to interfere with it, he
said.
   Gallo spoke at the Fifth International Conference on AIDS, which
ended Friday.
   His studies of the cancer, called Kaposi's sarcoma, offer one
possible explanation for the origin of the disease in AIDS patients.
   Others have evidence that Kaposi's sarcoma may be caused by a
virus other than AIDS, but Gallo's work suggests otherwise.
   He reported a study showing the cancer developed in mice that
were genetically engineered to contain an AIDS virus gene called
tat. The tat gene is a kind of supercharger that speeds up
replication of the AIDS virus.
   The mice carrying the tat gene developed Kaposi's sarcoma, but
the cancer did not arise in the cells carrying the gene. It arose
from other cells.
   That suggests the gene triggers production of some biochemical
factor that causes the cancer.
   He also showed that certain Kaposi's sarcoma cells called spindle
cells release ``a whole series of biological molecules that allow us
to create KS in a mouse.''
   If the work proves correct, it offers the possibility that drugs
could be designed to interfere with these molecules and thus treat
or prevent Kaposi's sarcoma, Gallo said.
   The AIDS virus infects certain white blood cells that direct many
immune functions. They are called T4 cells or CD4 cells.
   Gallo argues other viruses that activate the immune system _ and
therefore activate T4 cells _ can aggravate infection with the AIDS
virus, known as the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   For example, a leukemia-causing virus called HTLV-1 can infect
the same cells infected with HIV and can ``turn on'' HIV in the
cells, triggering production of more HIV, he said.
   Human herpes virus type 6, or HHV-6, which was discovered
recently by Gallo and his colleagues, also can infect the same cells
and turn on HIV, he said.
   Gallo described a possible vicious cycle in which HHV-6 and HIV
work together to cause disease.
   ``All of us in this room almost have HHV-6,'' he said. Healthy
people control it; it causes no illness. But HIV weakens the immune
system, allowing HHV-6 to grow.
   The proliferating HHV-6 then activates production of HIV, in
Gallo's scenario. The HIV further weakens the immune system,
allowing further growth of HHV-6 _ and so on.

<TEXT>
   President Bush isn't ready to make a tax deal
to gain House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski's
backing for a lower capital gains tax rate, Bush's spokesman said
Friday.
   ``There are no deals. We are pleased that the chairman is moving
in the direction of supporting (lower) capital gains. We still
believe our original proposal is the best one and the right way to
go,'' said presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Earlier this week, Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat who heads
the House's tax-originating committee, suggested he might go along
with lowering the tax rate on capital gains, a move advocated by
Bush.
   However, Rostenkowski also hinted there were some strings
attached to his offer _ namely, that the president back away from
his no-new-taxes pledge to support some form of new taxes to help
reduce the budget deficit.
   Bush's original proposal is to lower the capital gains rate from
its current maximum level of 33 percent to 15 percent. He claims
such a move would stimulate more business investment and bring in
some $5 billion in new revenues.
   Democrats, including Rostenkowski, had previously dismissed the
proposal as a tax break mainly favoring the rich. Capital gains are
the profits on the sale of real estate, stocks, works of art and
other assets.
   Fitzwater conceded that Bush had ``talked about these matters
with Chairman Rostenkowski.'' But, he reiterated, ``We haven't made
any deals.''
   ``We stick to all our former positions on a tax increase,'' he

   A dispute between the wife of Gov. Mario Cuomo
and some of her family members over her father's $13 million estate
has been settled, a lawyer said Friday.
   The settlement was reached during an emotional courthouse
conference Tuesday on Long Island attended by Matilda Cuomo, her
mother and other family members, said Mrs. Cuomo's lawyer, Peter
Johnson Jr.
   ``It was at once jubilant and tearful. The family members
embraced,'' Johnson said. ``There were many tears shed. It was a
very happy moment because a family which had been split, made a
decision to come together.''
   Terms of the settlement were not announced.
   ``Obviously, we were pleased by the settlement,'' Johnson said.
``I wish I could tell you more, but I can't.''
   Nassau County Surrogate C. Raymond Radigan issued a brief
statement that said the family members felt the settlement was
``equitable and harmonious.''
   The settlement ended months of strife over the will of Charles
Raffa, a real estate investor and supplier of grocery store fixtures
who died Oct. 19.
   Mrs. Cuomo, her sister and one of her brothers opposed the
bequest of most of the estate to her mother and her other two
brothers.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno faced unprecedented and
embarrassing questioning in Parliament on Friday about a magazine
article that said he paid a geisha to be his mistress.
   After only a week in office, Uno is seeing one taboo after
another fall as his supposedly scandal-free background takes a
beating from unexpected quarters.
   Geishas traditionally do not reveal the identity of patrons.
Japanese mainstream media traditionally do not report on
politicians' dalliances. Opposition legislators traditionally do not
raise such subjects in Parliament.
   It all changed this week, with an anonymous account in Sunday
Mainichi magazine asserting Uno ``bought'' a geisha who denounced
him as immoral.
   At first the accusation got only scattered mentions.
   But on Friday, Socialist Manae Kubota posed the question in the
House of Councilors. The exchange was broadcast on the evening
television news and transmitted nationwide by Kyodo, the country's
top news agency.
   Miss Kubota, an activist on women's issues, said The Washington
Post had reported on the claim. ``If it's not true, you should
clearly protest,'' she admonished the prime minister.
   Looking discomfited, Uno replied, ``I will refrain from
commenting publicly on such a kind of report concerning myself.''
   Earlier this week he told inquiring journalists the story was not
true, but that was reported only in a few dailies.
   Uno, 66, was foreign minister until June 2 when the governing
Liberal Democratic Party chose him to change its scandal-plagued
image and guide Japan through difficult foreign challenges.
   His main qualifications were his unblemished reputation and
foreign experience, but the geisha scandal challenges both his
supposed strengths.
   ``Buying prostitutes isn't tolerated in international society,''
Miss Kubota told The Associated Press after the exchange. She said
she thought Uno was unfit to represent Japan abroad, and that was
why she brought up the formerly taboo subject.
   Sunday Mainichi quoted an unidentified 40-year-old woman as
saying Uno paid her $2,100 a month to be his mistress for four
months in 1985. She said she now works as an office assistant.
   As a geisha, she would have been trained in classical song, dance
and conversation. A true geisha is not a prostitute, but she would
entertain male guests at traditional restaurants and might become
the mistress of a favored patron.
   The anonymous woman was quoted as saying Uno fell in love with
her, but she purportedly came to dislike his ``selfish behavior''
and ``bullying'' of an older woman who managed the geisha's
restaurant. Uno decided to end the arrangement, she reportedly said,
but still wanted to call on her to meet him for a fee.
   ``He is not a man of noble character,'' the woman was quoted as
saying. ``I don't want him to use politics in the same way he
treated me.''
   The article said the affair was a scandal and suggested Uno is
not the right person to salvage the Liberal Democratic Party from a
bribery scandal that forced Noboru Takeshita to resign as prime
minister.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Secord Plea To Keep Iran-Contra Charges Separate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday rejected arguments by
Iran-Contra figure Richard Secord and combined 12 criminal charges
against him into a single indictment.
   Chief U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson took three counts
against Secord involving accusations of illegal gifts to Oliver
North and consolidated the with nine new charges accusing Secord of
lying to Congress.
   The alleged lies involve covering up Secord's own profits in the
Iran-Contra affair and denying that North received any benefits from
the maze of corporations known as the Enterprise set up by Secord
and business partner Albert Hakim.
   North, who enlisted Secord to run arms to the Nicaraguan rebels
during a congressional ban on military aid to the Contras, was
convicted last month of accepting a $13,800 home security system
from Secord. North faces sentencing June 23 for that and two other
crimes in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   The government says Secord's profits from running arms to the
Nicaraguan Contras and assisting the Reagan administration's secret
Iran arms initiative totaled more than $1 million.
   Consolidating the 1988 gratuities charges against Secord with the
nine-count indictment brought in April will serve ``the interests of
judicial economy and sound administration,'' Judge Robinson said in
a two-page order.
   Secord's lawyer, Thomas Green, argued Thursday in favor of trying
Secord on the gratuities charges alone.
   Green said the new indictment is laden with potential problems
over the use of classified information which ``will delay any trial.
... In short, consolidation will not result in any judicial
economy.'' Green also said the indictments are not logically related.
   But Robinson said proof for the gratuities charges would be
admissible to prove the cover-up allegations and that there is
little doubt that consolidation is appropriate.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has said it
plans to offer no classified documents in prosecuting the 12 charges.
   Secord's claim to classified documents in his defense will have
very little likelihood of success, the prosecution said in a court
filing.
   Associate independent counsel Reid Weingarten said the government
would seek dismissal of broad conspiracy, theft and wire fraud
charges against Secord. They focus on the diversion of Iran arms
sale money to the Contras and prosecuting them would involve the use
of extensive amounts of sensitive material. U.S. intelligence
agencies are unwilling to turn over such material to Secord without
a painstaking, page-by-page review, the government said in a recent
court filing.
   Identical conspiracy and theft charges were dismissed against
North when intelligence agencies refused to declassify national
secrets contained in material that was relevant to the prosecution's
case and North's defense.

   He is making the trip to discuss the $1.2 billion anti-crime
package he recently sent to Congress, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater

   The president has proposed building more prisons, widening the
death penalty, banning imports of semiautomatic assault weapons and
hiring more prosecutors and drug agents.
   Most of the money would go to expand the capacity of the
48,000-bed federal prison system by 50 percent.

<TEXT>
   Two bombs exploded in the main seaside
boulevard of Moslem west Beirut only seconds apart Friday. Three
people were reported killed and four wounded.
   The blasts shook the Syrian-controlled area in the midmorning as
Syrian gunners in the same coastal district opened artillery fire on
Christian areas. The attacks have become a daily ritual aimed at
preventing Christian units of the Lebanese army from receiving
military supplies by sea.
   No one claimed responsibility for the bomb blasts in the Moslem
neighborhood.
   A police spokesman and radio reports quoted an explosives expert
as saying the blasts were caused by two bombs placed under two
coffee-carrying vans _ a Volkswagen and a Honda.
   The police spokesman said the blasts hurled a coffee vendor's
body into the Mediterranean sea.
   ``Two men who were having coffee near the Honda van were severely
wounded and evacuated by private cars to hospital before ambulances
could reach the blast scene. They didn't make it,'' he said.
   Rescuers were not bothered by the thuds of explosions as a Syrian
130mm howitzer battery fired away.
   The police spokesman said about 60 shells exploded around the
Christian ports of Junieh and Byblos north of Beirut. No casualties
were reported.
   The Syrians have been shelling the Christian coastline despite a
cease-fire arranged by the Arab League nations on May 11.
   The latest round of civil war broke out March 8, two days after
army commander Michel Aoun, who also leads a Christian cabinet
rivaling a Moslem government, ordered a blockade of ports south of
Beirut run by Syrian-backed militias.
   More than 360 people have been killed and 1,400 wounded.
   Syria maintains about 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab
League peacekeeping mandate, but they are now allied with the
Moslems. Aoun has vowed to drive them out.

<TEXT>
   The State Department said Friday the reported
Nicaraguan transfer of weapons to Panama is ``deeply offensive to
all who support democracy in Latin America.''
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the Nicaraguan
action constituted backing for Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio
Noriega, whom she accused of stealing last month's national
elections and of using thugs to ``viciously assault the legitimate
victor.''
   Sandinista officials have confirmed that grenade launchers, light
artillery and dozens of AK-47 rifles were sent to Panama to help
that country's security forces in the event of a U.S. military
attack.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that at the Organization of American State
foreign ministers meeting this week, Nicaragua stood alone in
defending Noriega and opposed sending an OAS commission to Panama to
resolve the political crisis there.
   She also accused the Sandinistas of attempting to rig Nicaragua's
electoral process by denying the opposition fair representation in
the all-powerful electoral tribunal.
   ``The composition of the tribunal as named by President (Daniel)
Ortega and confirmed by the Sandinista-dominated National Assembly
only includes one member out of the five who belongs to the bloc of
democratic-opposition parties,'' she said.
   ``The Sandinistas cannot have it both ways. They cannot rig the
rules of the election and claim legitimacy for the results,'' she
added.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Leader Says Government Fails in Its Responsibility to
Indians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After investigating for 17 months, collecting a
million pages of documents and holding 20 days of public hearings, a
Senate panel is preparing a report detailing what its chairman calls
the government's failed responsibility to Indians.
   Members of a special unit of the Senate Select Committee on
Indian Affairs have advocated that Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
Jr. make reforms in the agencies responsible to native Americans.
   ``I cannot think of any area where the federal government has so
completely abdicated its responsibility as it has in Indian
affairs,'' Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., chairman of the special
committee, said Thursday.
   At the same time, Lujan told the committee he thought his
department was doing a generally good job.
   ``However, I am sure that the Department of Interior can do
more,'' Lujan added. ``I believe the department has no
responsibility more serious than our trust responsibilities to the
Indians. I welcome continuing discussions about ways in which we can
enhance our procedures for legal representation on these complex
Indian issues,'' the secretary said.
   The committee, which also included Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
and Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., looked at federal agencies dealing with
native Americans and found them lacking in many respects.
   But DeConcini said some positive actions have already come as a
result of the committee's work.
   ``First, we have brought the misconduct of Navajo Chairman Peter
MacDonald and other tribal officials to the attention of their
respective tribes and the U.S. Department of Justice, who are taking
action,'' he said.
   MacDonald was ousted as chairman of the Navajos when contracting
irregularities involving payments to MacDonald were revealed by
Senate staff investigators.
   DeConcini also said 20 firms that were improperly receiving
Indian contracts were exposed.
   ``Many of them are now being sued or debarred by tribal
governments, as well as investigated by the Justice Department,'' he
said.
   The problem of child abuse on some reservations that was brought
to light has led to creation of parent support groups and community
awareness programs, he said.
   Lujan said Bureau of Indian Affairs employees with direct access
to children are now given deeper background checks before hiring.
   DeConcini said that a hearing last month on encroachment by
private individuals onto Indian land in the Arkansas riverbed has
inspired several companies and people to contact the Cherokee,
Choctaw and Chickasaw tribes who own the land, with offers to pay
royalties.
   The senator said hearings on oil and gas theft from Indians
caused tribes and oil producers to hire new inspectors to help
prevent such theft.
   Litigation has begun in efforts to recover compensation for
stolen oil and the Justice Department is conducting a criminal
investigation based on the evidence the committee developed, he said.
   But despite what he considered successes, DeConcini expressed
dismay that conditions were so bad.
   ``Why weren't these problems discovered and dealt with earlier?''
he said. ``And how can the federal government spend $3 billion a
year on Indian programs with no assurance that the most fundamental
standards of accountability are being met?''
   The Indian Health Service came under criticism but never got a
public hearing. The committee canceled questioning because the
agency had delayed sending requested documents. DeConcini said the
committee and its staff will continue to pursue the investigation of
the IHS through the summer.
   ``Since our hearing May 15, IHS has sent us tens of thousands of
pages of documents, carefully tabulated and organized,'' he said.
``Our investigative staff has just begun to systematically examine
these papers.''
   Officials of the health service may be called to testify in
public. It also is possible that their testimony will be taken in
deposition form and included in the report without a public hearing,
DeConcini said.
   Legislation is expected to be recommended this fall as part of
the committee's final report which DeConcini said will not be
complimentary.
   ``The federal agencies entrusted with administering Indian
programs have clearly failed in their responsibility,'' he said.
``Moreover, they have failed to even recognize their own
inadequacies.''

<HEAD>Agreement Would Ban Low-level Military Flights Over Wilderness</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-level military flights over a million-acre
wilderness would be banned under an agreement between federal
officials and environmentalists, who say the flights shatter the
area's tranquility.
   The agreement, which requires approval of the Federal Aviation
Administration, is intended to settle a lawsuit brought against
defense officials by six environmental groups, who also say the
flights by Air National Guard jets often have been lower than
federal law allows.
   Richard Duncan, a attorney who represented the environmental
groups, said Thursday the agreement is ``the best possible
solution.''
   ``The agreement avoids a couple years of litigation,'' he said.
``And we think that litigation would have resulted in a redesigned
military operations area, anyway.''
   The agreement would shift the boundaries of the Snoopy Military
Operations Area so that it would no longer extend above the Boundary
Waters Canoe Area in northeastern Minnesota.
   The Snoopy area is used primarily for flight training by the
Duluth-based 148th Fighter Interceptor Group.
   The agreement also would restrict military flights over the canoe
area to no lower than 18,000 feet above sea level. Federal law
prohibits flights over the canoe area below 4,000 feet above sea
level, which in most places there would be 2,000 to 2,500 feet above
the ground.
   If the FAA approves, the Snoopy area would be shifted away from
the canoe area's southern boundary toward the south and east. The
Snoopy area, established in 1976, lies above 1.6 million acres of
northeastern Minnesota. The shift would establish a new, slightly
larger military air space, part of which would be above Lake
Superior.
   Such a boundary shift is not expected to create problems for
military training flights, said Army Capt. David Wirwahn, a
spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Military Affairs, which
oversees the state Air Guard.
   ``We're sensitive to environmental concerns (but) we also realize
the need for training in air defense,'' Wirwahn said. ``We think
this agreement will allow us to accomplish that training (and) be
responsive to the citizens of Minnesota.''
   The lawsuit was filed last June in U.S. District Court by Friends
of the Boundary Waters Wilderness, Izaak Walton League, Sierra Club,
Wilderness Society, Friends of Animals and Their Environment and
Help Our Wolves Live.
   Kevin Proescholdt, executive director of Friends of the Boundary
Waters Wilderness, said the agreement ``will get the jets out of the
BWCA and restore the solitude and silence for which the area is
renowned.''

   Two journalists working for international
news agencies have lost their credentials to report from Bahrain and
one is being expelled, a newspaper reported Friday.
   The Ministry of Information took the action against Salim
Yassine, deputy manager of Agence-France Presse's regional office in
Bahrain, and Mariam Al Khalifa of Reuters, a member of Bahrain's
ruling family, the Gulf Daily News reported.
   It quoted an unidentified ministry official as saying Yassine's
residency also had been terminated and that he was expected to leave
the island nation by the end of the month.
   The official said the reporters had not complied with ``ministry
rules of conduct for the press,'' according to the newspaper.
Ministry officials declined to elaborate on the report.
   AFP's chief of bureau Jean-Pierre Perrin and Ms. Khalifa declined
comment. The ministry action apparently was related to stories the
correspondents wrote about the Shiite Moslem community and their
views on Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
who died last Saturday.
   Shiite communities around the world, including Bahrain's, have
mourned his death.
   Under Khomeini's rule, Arab states accused Iran of seeking to
export its fundamentalist revolution. But relations among the
nations and Iran have improved somewhat since Iran accepted a
cease-fire last summer in its eight-year war with Iraq.
   Yassine, a Lebanese national, has been with the French news
agency in Bahrain for two years.
   Ms. Khalifa joined Reuters 2{ years ago after 18 months as a
reporter for the Gulf Daily News. She was Reuter's only reporter
based on the island.

   The White House said Friday that President Bush
has made no final decisions on negotiating strategies for the arms
talks with the Soviet Union that resume in Geneva June 19.
   Asked about reports that the Joint Chiefs of Staff were urging
the president to soften the previous administration's stand on
antimissile systems, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
only that Bush has made no ``final judgments yet.''
   Bush has held several meetings with his national security
advisers, including the joint chiefs, on negotiating positions and
strategy for the START talks, Fitzwater said.
   The U.S.-Soviet talks aimed at reaching a new agreement to reduce
long-range nuclear missiles were stalled last year over the Reagan
administration's efforts to develop a space-based missile shield
called the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   The joint chiefs reportedly recommended that Bush drop the
insistence that the United States retain the right to deploy such a
missile defense.
   Fitzwater said the Bush administration will use as ``the starting
point for discussions'' with the Soviets the same position that was
on the table at the end of the Reagan administration.
   ``Nevertheless, there are a number of negotiating positions and
strategies that the president will be instructing his negotiators to
take into the talks,'' said Fitzwater.
   ``All these matters are under consideration but the president has
not made final judgments, on this question of the ABM treaty or on
most of the major other questions, too,'' he said.
   The 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty permits testing of
unsophisticated devices, but bars advanced missile tests and
deployment.

<TEXT>
   Despite millions of listeners, radio talk show
hosts say they're feeling ignored and maligned. So these arbiters of
the air waves have decided to take a cue from other minorities and
organize.
   On Friday, about 50 of the country's 225 radio talk show hosts
began arriving for the inaugural TalkRadio Conference. The
organizer, Jerry Williams of WRKO-Boston, said he hopes the
gathering will be part professional society, part lobby group and
part movement.
   ``In the words of Rodney Dangerfield, `We don't get no respect,'
'' said Williams, 65 and in the professional talk business since
1950. ``The national media ... never took us very seriously. They
think there's some conspiracy here.''
   The function of the radio talk show and the gathering is to
simply enhance the public forum for exchanging opinions, Williams
said.
   ``There's a huge void where people feel they don't have a voice
anymore,'' he said. Around him the room was a hubbub of smooth, deep
voices, big smiles and well-rehearsed words.
   The gathering ``is about freedom of speech, and that there's
really very little freedom of speech left in this country,'' said
Mills Crenshaw, of KTKK-AM in Salt Lake City.
   ``There is no more representative government in this country any
more. It's all special interests,'' Crenshaw said. ``The reason
politicians are afraid of talk radio is we have the ability to allow
private citizens to talk to their government.''
   Williams said the idea for a conference came to him after he was
able to marshal his talk-show colleagues to lead a protest against
proposed federal pay increases last February.
   Led by their local hosts, listeners nationwide dispatched to
Congress a load of tea bags bearing the message: ``Read my tea bag:
no 50 percent raise.'' The public pressure helped halt a pay hike
for lawmakers, judges and other people on the federal payroll.
   Williams was encouraged by this to make the connections more
formal.
   The two-day gab confab was expected to include consumer activist
Ralph Nader, radio show host-gone-TV Morton Downey Jr. and political
columnist Jack Anderson.
   Friday's event was _ what else? _ a call-in show over an open
mike to Boston. On Saturday, the conferees planned to get down to
business and talk to each other, exchanging ideas and formally
organizing, Williams said.
   Faneuil Hall, the venerable brick building where revolutionaries
fomented independence from Britain and abolitionists railed against
slavery, served as the stage for the gab fest.

   A small French-owned airplane flying in thick
fog crashed into a mountain near this northern city, killing all
five people on board, a civil defense spokesman said Friday.
   The spokesman, Jose Manuel Sariego, said rescue workers located
the wreckage and the charred bodies Friday morning on Pico El
Celleru mountain about 35 miles north of Leon.
   The plane, a Piper-32, had left the northern city of Oviedo early
Thursday for Madrid. When it failed to arrive in the Spanish
capital, civil defense officials ordered a search, Sariego said.
   Sariego identified the dead as Frenchmen Jacques Lamarque, Ciril
Laurent, Catherine Moucheri and Valeri Niore, and Francisco Busquet,
a Spaniard. Lamarque was the pilot, Sariego said.
   He said the hometowns of the victims were not known.
   Investigators said the plane was flying in heavy fog when it
struck the face of the mountain at a point 424 feet above sea level.
   It was owned by the French air club of Auxerre, Sariego said.

   A fundamentalist Protestant demonstrator
rushed toward Pope John Paul during an outdoor Mass on Friday, but
Vatican security agents and Swedish police stopped the unarmed man
and dragged him away.
   Authorities hauled the man, identified only as a 28-year-old
Swede, into a police van and drove him to a station for questioning,
said police Inspector Ulf Ohlsson. He said no one was injured.
   The demonstrator belonged to a fundamentalist Protestant group
that opposes the pope's efforts to improve Roman Catholic relations
with the state church of this overwhelmingly Lutheran country,
Ohlsson said.
   Police said the protester was carrying leaflets denouncing the
pope ``with all his abominations'' to distribute to participants at
the Mass.
   They said he would be released without charge and refused to
disclose his name in keeping with Swedish practice.
   It was not clear why the protester rushed toward the pope as John
Paul disrtibuted communion.
   Witnesses said four or five agents wrestled with the
demonstrator, who came within 10 yards of the pope, and pulled him
away from a security barrier around the altar. They pinned him to
the ground until the police van arrived.
   Several other fundamentalists were outside the Mass. The Maranata
group, which sometimes calls the pope's teachings ``fascist,'' says
no church, or the pope, is needed to speak to God _ just the Bible.
   It was the most serious incident during John Paul's tour of five
Scandinavian countries, which ends Saturday. On May 2, Norwegian
police hauled away demonstrators from a Mass in Tromsoe, but those
protesters did not get near the pope.
   The incident in Sweden caused little disruption. It appeared that
many people were unaware anything had happened. ``I saw some
commotion, but I thought it was someone fainting'' said a nun who
did not give her name.
   Earlier in the day, the pope attacked abortion and euthanasia
while emphasizing family values.
   ``The primary right which society must defend is the right to
life. Whether in the womb or in the final phase of life, a person
may never be disposed of in order to make life easier for others,''
he said in a speech at the 500-year-old Uppsala University.
   Abortion in the first three months of pregnancy is legal and
widely practiced throughout Scandinavia. Euthanasia is illegal,
although it has been debated.
   John Paul also praised Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat
credited with saving thousands of Jews in Hungary from Nazi death
camps.
   ``I cannot fail to mention your compatriot Raoul Wallenberg, who
in praiseworthy fashion rescued so many members of the Jewish people
from Nazi concentration camps. His example inspires a dedicated
fight for human rights.''
   Wallenberg disappeared after he was arrested by Soviet troops
entering Budapest in January 1945.
   Moscow has said he died in a Soviet prison in 1947, but Soviet
dissident sources claim he was seen alive in the 1980s. The Swedish
and U.S. governments have called on the Soviets to release all the
facts in the case.
   In addition to Sweden and Norway, John Paul has visited Denmark,
Finland and Iceland during his 42nd foreign trip. He is to return to
Rome on Saturday.
   Throughout his visit to the largely Lutheran region, the pope has
stressed unity among Christian denominations, despite their
differences.

   Anti-apartheid groups said
extending the state of emergency for a fourth year Friday proves the
government is illegitimate. Supporters said the action will promote
peace and constitutional reform.
   ``Only in police and totalitarian states does the government
assume such frightening powers when it is not at war,'' said
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu. ``The state of emergency is very
convenient for an authoritarian government that has no legitimacy
amongst the majority of the people.''
   In Washington, 57 senators and the State Department expressed
``disappointment'' at the extension of emergency powers.
   ``A peaceful end to apartheid will only be possible if political
and human rights are respected in South Africa,'' said a telegram by
38 Democrats and 19 Republicans to President P.W. Botha.
   Botha extended the 3-year-old emergency at midnight without
making any changes in the restrictions on freedom of the press,
speech and assembly, or reducing the power of police to take any
action they deem necessary to maintain law and order.
   Botha said that although political violence has declined,
revolutionaries were ``continuing underground to mobilize and to
exert their influence.'' He said emergency rule permits his National
Party government to proceed with upgrading black living conditions
and seeking negotiations with black leaders on changes in the
apartheid system.
   But Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, one of those the government
is trying to coax into negotiations, called the extension ``a tragic
indication of the abnormality of our society.
   ``Real negotiation between white and black leaders will not get
off the ground while political leaders remain in jail and others are
under a constant threat of detention,'' he said.
   Approximately 30,000 people, mostly black, were detained without
trial during the emergency. Hundreds were freed this year after a
hunger strike among detainees, but officials say restrictions were
imposed on about 500 of them.
   The restrictions include house arrest, bans on speaking in
public, writing articles for publication, attending political
meetings or criticizing the government.
   F.W. de Klerk, leader of the National Party and Botha's
designated successor after September parliamentary elections,
expressed his full support for the decision to extend the emergency
for another year. He said a certain degree of stability had been
achieved through the decrease in violence and the advancement of
social and economic development in black townships.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.

<HEAD>Walesa Thanks Voters for Solidarity Victory</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa thanked voters Friday for
Solidarity's overwhelming victory in weekend parliamentary elections
and explained why he opposed the union's joining a Communist-led
government coalition now.
   He said Solidarity was not ready to rule and must remain faithful
to voters who want it to counter Communist rule in the National
Assembly, as the Sejm, the existing parliament, and the newly
created Senate will be called.
   ``Everywhere where society agrees with the government, we will
support the government, and where it is inconsistent with social
feeling, we are opposed,'' Walesa told a news conference in Gdansk.
   He said the immediate objective of his independent trade union
movement was not Cabinet positions ``but only to control and to
broaden democracy and freedom. Probably this concept will prevail.''
   Walesa said some Solidarity candidates favor joining a coalition
at once, but others want the union to stay in opposition and support
authorities only on an issue-by-issue basis.
   The government has prodded Solidarity to join a coalition
government after the humiliating rejection of 33 of 35 top party and
government leaders who ran unopposed last Sunday on a ``national
list.''
   Election results showed Solidarity won 160 of the 161 seats in
the Sejm available to the opposition and 92 of the 100 seats in the
Senate.
   ``I would like to thank voters for their effort, for the
elections and for their attitude toward Solidarity,'' Walesa said.
   A new round of elections will be held June 18 for the 33
unopposed seats left vacant and for 262 contested Sejm seats and
eight Senate seats in which no candidate received 50 percent of the
vote in the first round.
   The top two vote-getters for each seat will be entered in the
runoffs.
   Walesa returned to Gdansk after an eight-hour meeting with
government officials Thursday at which the two sides agreed to hold
new elections for the 33 vacant seats. Communist officials said
candidates for those seats have yet to be decided, but all 33 races
will be competitive.
   Senior Solidarity advisers said the union received scores of
letters and phone calls from supporters urging it to resist the
temptation to join the Communists in a coalition.
   ``I will be advocating the concept that we should remain the
opposition and don't go into the government because that's not what
we went there for,'' Walesa said, referring to the Thursday meeting
with the government.
   ``It may look like we went there for (Cabinet) chairs. Already
now there are voices about betrayal. We will not permit an departure
from the road of reforms, but we don't have a mandate for ruling.''
   Walesa said Solidarity would respect the round-table agreements
concluded with authorities April 5 guaranteeing the Communists 65
percent _ or 299 seats _in the 460-member Sejm with the remaining
seats reserved for the opposition.
   ``We must explain to society that we didn't give as much as a
button and that the coalition gets what belongs to it. ... We can't
negate it, because that's what the agreement was,'' Walesa said.
   Walesa had said beforehand he would vote for all but one
candidate on the national list. He called the slate's defeat a
``terrible thing'' because of the political crisis that ensued.
   On the list were many government members of the round-table talks
that led to legalizing Solidarity after a seven-year ban and to
Poland's freest elections in more than 40 years. Among those
rejected by voters were Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and
seven other members of the 17-member Politburo.
   Solidarity is concerned that the Sejm could lose its importance
if major representatives of the authorities are not seated.
   At least one rejected candidate _ Politburo member Alfred
Miodowicz, the head of the official trade unions _ on Friday ruled
out another bid for election.

   About 50,000 people demonstrated peacefully Friday
in Shanghai, but protest subsided in other provincial cities and
authorities announced the arrests of dozens of people.
   National television news showed videotape for the first time of
extensive damage done by crowds protesting the military crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing.
   It showed a department store and surrounding buildings burned to
the ground in the southwestern city of Chengdu, where sources
reported several days of violent protest, and soldiers on patrol.
Another segment showed protesters burning buses in Huhan, central
China, and throwing stones in Changsha.
   Most of the report focused on the arrests of dozens of youths in
those cities and in Harbin, many said to be unemployed, for
allegedly taking part in the violence. There were no reports of
violence occurring Friday.
   The only demonstration reported was the one in Shanghai, China's
largest city, where the crowd gathered in People's Square to mourn
six people killed by a train Tuesday night. The six were standing at
a barricade on the tracks near the Shanghai station and a train from
Beijing did not stop in time.
   People in the crowd set fire to the train and fought with firemen
and police who came to put it out, injuring more than 20.
   Television news said workers were mobilized to clear Shanghai
streets of buses overturned and burned by protesters or parked
across roads to block the way if soldiers tried to enter the city.
   ``All streets were completely cleared,'' the news said.
   Mayor Zhu Rongji of Shanghai said in a stern speech carried by
local radio and television: ``I would like to warn those do-nothings
and unlawful elements in society: Don't misjudge the situation.
Don't dream of a change in dynasty. All our good Shanghai citizens
will not tolerate your lawlessness any more.''
   He said those who set fire to the train had been arrested and
would be tried openly and severely punished.
   Arrests also were reported in Guiyang, Lanzhou and Zhengzhou.
   ``Guiyang city public security has issued a serious warning:
Those lawless and criminal elements who participated in the
activities of beating, smashing and looting must surrender
themselves,'' said the radio in the capital of Guizhou province,
southern China.
   It said 24 people were arrested after crowds rampaged Wednesday,
throwing stones and bottles at buses, commandeering others,
destroying a police motorcycle, smashing shops and looting.
   In Lanzhou, capital of Gansu province in western China, 19 people
were detained for allegedly destroying traffic installations and
erecting barricades, the provincial radio reported. It said police
confiscated daggers, steel pipes, chains and other weapons.
   Zhengzhou radio, in the capital of Henan province, said police
arrested people on charges of damaging street installations and
overturning a vehicle. It said they were not students, but did not
say how many were detained.
   More than a dozen cities reported violent protests this week, in
many of which people blocked roads, paralyzed traffic and attacked
police.

   Israeli troops fatally wounded a Palestinian
teen-ager in Bethlehem Friday, and Arabs organized a general strike
throughout the occupied territories as their uprising entered its
19th month.
   At least 18 Palestinans were reported wounded by army gunfire in
scattered clashes in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, hospital
officals reported.
   The fatal shooting occured near Manger Square in Bethlehem when
troops opened fire to disperse youths who erected road barricades
and were throwing stones.
   The victim, Rehyad Salhab, 17, suffered a gunshot wound in the
chest and was dead on arrival at Bethlehem's Mount David Hospital.
The army said it was investigating.
   His death raised to 513 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising begain in December 1987. Twenty-two Israelis have been
killed in the violence.
   The general strike was called by pro-Palestine Liberation
Organization leaders ``to mark the monthly anniversary of the
uprising,'' said leaflets distributed in the territories.
   The Gaza Strip remained under indefinite curfew, restricting its
700,000 residents to their homes for the sixth consecutive day.
   In the Jerusalem neighborhood of Talpiot a Palestinian man
entered a Jewish family's home, grabbed a kitchen knife and stabbed
a 2-year-old toddler slightly injuring her in the neck, Israel radio
said.
   It reported the Palestinian was from the neighboring Arab village
of Jabel Mukaber and it was believed he is mentally unbalanced.
   The neighborhood has been the scene of numerous fights between
Palestinans and Israelis.
   Hospital officials said that in the West Bank at least five
Palestinians were wounded by army gunfire in scattered clashes,
including a 13-year-old boy from the village of Burka who was shot
in the neck.
   They said 13 Palestinians were hospitalized in the Gaza Strip
with gunshot wounds. Arab reports said the violence centered on the
Beach refugee camp where nine Palestinians were shot in a fight
between troops and stone throwers.
   The army confirmed that three Palestinians were wounded by
soldiers in the occupied lands and said it was checking the other
reports.

crushing the student demonstrations.
   Deng said, ``Our troops never forgot the people, never forgot the
party, never forgot the country's interest,'' and accused
demonstrators of attempting to overthrow communism and ``establish a
capitalist republic.''

<HEAD>Hills' Letter Attacking Sugar Quotas Dismays Producers</HEAD>

   The U.S. trade representative's attacks on
sugar import quotas hit sour notes on Capitol Hill this week.
   An industry official said producers would be swiftly knocked out
of business if the trade representative, Carla Hills, has her way
during trade negotiations in Geneva.
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, said he's not pleased.
   Ms. Hills' office said she's been misunderstood, and she is not
advocating unilateral abolition of the quotas.
   ``When someone is telling you they want to put you out of
business, it could well be described as hysteria,'' said Mike
Morton, a lobbyist for the Florida Sugar Cane League and the Rio
Grande Valley Sugar Growers.
   The source of the furor is a May 24 letter Ms. Hill wrote El
Salvador's Ambassador, Ernesto Rivas Gallont, that the
administration is ``pursuing the elimination of the U.S. sugar
program through the agricultural negotiations in the Uruguay Round''
of the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   De la Garza said he is seeking a White House meeting to determine
President Bush's position on the sugar program because ``I don't
know who is speaking for the administration.''
   Spokeswoman Claire Buchan said that while Ms. Hills' letter
``perhaps could have been more artfully written, there is no policy
change. The letter is not meant to imply there is one.''
   Ms. Hills does not advocate that the United States ``unilaterally
disarm our sugar producers'' but does agree with GATT's attempts to
move toward substantial, progressive reductions in all
trade-distorting agricultural policies such as import quotas and
export subsidies.
   ``It's a lot of to-do about nothing,'' agreed Tom Hammer,
president of the Sweetener Users Association, which represents
makers of sweetened beverages and foods and opposes the current
quota system.
   He said consumers pay an extra $3 billion a year to benefit a
mere 10,000 domestic producers.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter also believes the United
States should accept a GATT panel's recent findings that U.S. sugar
quotas violate international trade agreements and argues that the
next time the panel finds in the United States' favor, ``we could be
criticized for having a double standard,'' said spokeswoman Kelly
Shipp.
   Yeutter's position ``doesn't mean the sugar program is going to
end abruptly,'' she said.
   Morton, the growers' lobbyist, said the administration had
promised during the GATT panel's deliberations to fight for U.S.
authority to set sugar quotas.
   ``I think it is a disgrace that U.S. representatives of the
government do not have the sense to represent the best interests of
U.S. citizens, U.S. business and U.S. jobs,'' Morton said.
   Eiler Ravnholt, president of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters
Association and chairman of the American Sugar Alliance, a producer
coalition, said the industry is puzzled ``how we can effectively
negotiate reductions'' of sugar programs in other countries by
signaling beforehand the United States is ready to scrap its own.
   By limiting supply, quotas act to give U.S. producers a higher
price. This year's import limit is 1.24 million tons, which the
Agriculture Department allots country by country among 39 producing
nations. The department sets the quota to keep the U.S. price at a
level high enough to encourage U.S. production and avoid triggering
government purchases of surplus sugar.
   The U.S. price is currently twice the world price _ 22.5 cents
per pound vs. 11.75 cents.
   The high price also encourages users to use non-sugar sweeteners
like corn fructose.
   Quotas protect U.S. producers from instabilities in the world
market and without them, the producers would be unable to compete
against heavily subsidized European countries, Morton said.
   Quotas also give many poor Caribbean nations a guaranteed outlet
and price for at least part of their production, he said.

   The evacuation of foreigners from Beijing appeared
to be nearing completion as the final special flight chartered by
the U.S. State Department arrived Friday night in Tokyo with just 77
on board.
   U.S. Ambassador James Lilley saw off one of the last groups of
embassy dependents to leave China, which included his wife.
   ``We have moved out literally hundreds and hundreds of Americans.
... Our people working this problem have done an almost incredible
job,'' he said.
   Many Americans who left earlier in the week complained they
received no help from the embassy in evacuating and that many were
taken to safety or to the airport by cars and vans provided by other
embassies.
   The flood of foreigners fleeing turmoil-wracked China slowed to a
trickle, with jumbo jets only partially full. No more chartered
flights are being arranged, the spokeswoman said, since there are
``many seats'' now available on regularly scheduled flights, said
State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   About 1,500 Americans remain in China, down from 8,800 at the
beginning of this year, said Ms. Tutwiler. The embassy estimated 400
Americans remained in the city, including about 100 embassy
employees.
   Ms. Tutwiler said embassy personnel are making daily visits to
the universities and to the hotels and there are no American
students left at Beijing University, one of the rallying points of
the student pro-democracy movement.
   Many foreigners who had been in Beijing and Shanghai during the
last week were still shaken by the bloodshed and burning vehicles
they had seen, while some of those who journeyed from the provinces
said other parts of China seemed nearly untouched by unrest in the
capital.
   Some foreigners had trouble getting to Beijing because some
public transportation was suspended, because of police and military
roadblocks on the way to Beijing, and because drivers were afraid to
go to Beijing because of rumors of the dangerous situation there.
   Barbara Weingardner, an English teacher from Cedar Rapids, Iowa,
her husband and two children were at first unable to get
transportation to Beijing.
   She said the town where she had been living was ``very
peaceful.'' But because of rumors of the danger in the capital,
``nobody wanted to bring us into Beijing,'' she said.
   Later, Chinese officials arranged for a van with permission to
enter Beijing to transport the family.
   The West German government said Friday that it has withdrawn all
non-essential staff from its embassy in Beijing. On Wednesday it
ordered the evacuation of all West Germans working in Beijing and
their familes, except for diplomats and journalists.
   Of the 3,039 Japanese who lived in Beijing, only embassy
personnel and nine employees of trading companies remained behind,
Kyodo News Service reported.
   A journalist who flew to Beijing Friday morning said the Japan
Airlines jumbo jet carried only 21 people into China.

<HEAD>Watt Denies Influence Peddling in Meetins With Pierce</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Interior Secretary James Watt on Friday
denied using his contacts with former Reagan Cabinet colleague
Samuel Pierce to sway federally subsidized housing projects to
developers who paid Watt as a consultant.
   ``I never asked Secretary Pierce to do anything that would
embarrass him or me,'' said Watt of his meetings in early 1985 with
Pierce, who was secretary of housing and urban development at the
time. The meetings were in connection with a project to renovate a
low-income Maryland housing development under HUD's Section 8
Moderate Rehabilitation program.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif. chairman the House Government
Operations subcommittee on housing and employment, told Watt at a
hearing Friday, ``This project came into existence because of
influence-peddling by you. A much more worthy project may not have
come into existence because they didn't have the good fortune to
hire you.''
   And Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., told Watt, ``People had to pay to
get influence on their behalf. ... The fact remains you were able to
do something because of your prior Cabinet relationship with Sam
Pierce.''
   Watt said that in addition to his meetings with Pierce in
connection with the projects, he had several conversations with
three other HUD officials _ Deborah Gore Dean, a special assistant
to Pierce, and Silvio DeBartolomeis and Maurice Barksdale, who both
served as assistant secretary for housing during Pierce's tenure.
   However, Watt said he was not aware that Pierce had set up a
three-person panel, which included Dean, in the housing department
to select projects for moderate rehabilitation funding.
   He repeatedly rejected the characterization of his actions as
``influence-peddling,'' saying he merely met with Pierce to move
``the career bureaucracy'' in an agency which he said had become
paralyzed.
   ``I'm the messenger. ... You don't need to bad-mouth the
messenger,'' Watt retorted.
   Watt, who left the Cabinet in 1983, described what he termed a
``fee sharing arrangement'' with Phoenix Associates, a group headed
by Joseph Strauss who had been a special assistant to Pierce. Watt
and Phoenix were paid $300,000 as consultants to developer Judith
Siegel's Landex Corp. on a project to renovate 312 units at the
Kingsley Park Apartments in Essex, Md.
   Watt also testified he received $20,000 and $100,000 in
consultant fees from similar arrangements with the Phoenix group on
projects in New Jersey and Puerto Rico.
   ``You're much more than a messenger,'' Frank said. ``You are a
great critic of the established ways .. but when the chance to make
$169,000 came your way, that did not seem to motivate you.'' The
balance of the $300,000 went to Phoenix Associates.
   The overall program came under congressional scrutiny after the
HUD inspector general found it ``poorly managed'' with ``little or
no documentation or accountability'' and not in compliance with
``the competitive selection process'' required by federal
regulations and guidelines.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended the program in April, after the
investigative audit revealed several former HUD and other government
officials had assisted public housing authorities and developers in
obtaining grants to renovate or repair subsidized housing for
low-income families.
   Kemp has restored 1989 funding for the program and issued new
guidelines on June 1.
   At Friday's hearing, Lantos said, ``While in government, Mr. Watt
often belittled federal programs to assist the poor and the less
fortunate. He spoke of the dangers of being `lured by the crumbs of
subsidies, entitlements and giveaways.' But he apparently decided to
take advantage'' of them.
   Watt acknowledged he wasn't hired by developers for his housing
expertise, but he said there was ``no abuse, no illegality, nothing
done wrong in connection with my activities.''
   ``I have never received any HUD funds, federal funds or
government funds _ not U.S. government money or state government
money or city or county tax dollars,'' Watt said, emphasizing he was
instead paid from ``the developer's potential profits.''
   ``The point is, whether you were paid to influence the decisions
of government officials, and did you have the access that other
people did not,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn. ``That is the
classic definition of influence-peddling.'' week.
   Dean and DeBartolomeis are scheduled to testify next week before
Lantos' subcommittee, one of several congressional panels
investigating the housing program.

<HEAD>Compromise Immigration Package Clears Committee Hurdle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A compromise package that would produce the
first comprehensive update of the U.S. immigration system in 25
years is headed for the Senate floor after clearing its major
committee hurdle.
   ``This is not a perfect bill,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill.,
after the Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved the bill, 12-2.
   ``The driving element of our immigration system has been family
unification, and this only modestly shortens the backlogs. But it
will inject some new life and flexibility into a petrified system,''
Simon said.
   The measure provides for an overall immigration level of 600,000
annually, the first such cap in U.S. history. It reflects the
current flow plus 110,000.
   Under the two-track bill, about 480,000 visas would be reserved
for so-called family immigration, up from 436,000. A newly
established ``independent'' track for those with no current U.S.
relatives would provide for aproximately 120,000 visas. That
represents a jump in such immigration from a current level of about
54,000 a year.
   The bill had been stalled in the Judiciary Committee until a
compromise under which lawmakers moved to keep at the current level
_ 64,800 _ the number of brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens
permitted as immigrants.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., had urged a cut to 21,600 in that
category while Simon called for an increase to 84,000.
   Simpson and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. were co-sponsors of
the original version while Simon offered a rival plan.
   The compromise is expected to aid would-be immigrants from Asian
countries while the independent category was described by
congressional aides, who asked not to be identified by name, as a
boon to immigrants from African nations and some European countries,
including Ireland.
   The bill combines existing visas for professionals, persons of
exceptional merit and those with needed skills with 54,000 new ones
for ``independent'' immigrants annually.
   The 54,000 visas would be reserved for those qualifying under a
point-system, with points awarded for desirable attributes. At the
last minute, the committee voted to drop a provision that would
award 20 points to English language speakers. A number of lawmakers
recalled that their own relatives had arrived here without a command
of English.
   Thus far the House has taken no action on the issue. Bills
sponsored by Reps. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., and Hamilton Fish,
R-N.Y., are pending.

   Chrysler said one of the cushion frame attachments in the cars
could fail, causing the back of the front seat to collapse.
   The recall affects 1985 Dodge 600, Daytona and Lancer cars and
Chrysler Laser, LeBaron and LeBaron GTS models.
   Chrysler said the seat cushion frame in the cars will be replaced
with a stronger one and a reinforcement installed in a seat power
adjuster.
   Repairs will be performed at no cost, the company said.

<TEXT>
   The often raucous inaugural session of the new
Congress ended Friday with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev vigorously
denying he's power hungry and Andrei D. Sakharov demanding that the
Communist Party's legal monopoly on power be abolished.
   Gorbachev interrupted Sakharov's nationally televised speech from
the dais, saying he had spoken twice as long as permitted, but the
68-year-old Nobel Peace laureate continued, his voice rising and his
arms flailing.
   Sakharov, father of the Soviet human rights movement, told the
Congress of People's Deputies it had failed in its main task _ ``to
establish a system of power to overcome economic and social problems
and put an end to ecological madness.''
   The 1975 Nobel Peace laureate also said that by electing
Gorbachev president uncontested and investing him with far greater
powers, the deputies gave the Communist Party chief ``absolute
personal power.''
   He called for abolishing Article 6 of the Constitution, which
declares the party ``the leading and guiding force of Soviet society
and the nucleus of its political system.''
   His proposal also would empower the Congress to appoint the head
of the KGB secret police, the editor of the government newspaper
Izvestia, the chief of the Gostelradio state broadcasting authority
and other top officials.
   Gorbachev, to loud applause in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses,
vigorously objected to what he described as Sakharov's attempt to
``abase'' the work of the new parliament.
   Earlier, he called the meeting of the first parliament chosen by
multicandidate elections ``the most outstanding event in the entire
history of the Soviet state'' and a ``a new stage of perestroika,''
his 4-year-old campaign to reform the economy and society.
   In proceedings that began May 25 and lasted twice as long as
predicted, the Congress elected Gorbachev to a presidency with
vastly increased powers, named his protege Anatoly I. Lukyanov vice
president and chose 542 of its 2,250 members as a full-time
legislature to replace the old rubber-stamp Supreme Soviet.
   The parliament sessions, broadcast live, were gripping political
drama for millions of Soviets. They contained unprecedent public
criticism of Kremlin leaders and detailed reports on the country's
woes.
   Government officials disclosed data long classified by the
secretive bureaucracy. Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov continued the
trend Friday by revealing that the foreign debt is 34 billion
rubles, $52 billion at the official exchange rate.
   Congress subjected national leaders to an unprecedented grilling.
Gorbachev was driven on Friday to deny indignantly that he was
hungry for personal power, and to assure deputies he was in no
danger of being removed or assassinated.
   Reacting to challenges from several deputies that being both
Soviet president and chief of the Communist Party would make one man
too powerful, Gorbachev said: ``As a Communist, I categorically
reject hints ... I am trying to concentrate power in my own hands.''
   ``This is alien to me, to my views, my outlook, and my
character,'' he declared. ``I, as general secretary and president,
have no other policy than perestroika, democratization and glasnost.
In this, I see the point of my life and my work.''
   Responding to comments he reported hearing from deputies about
the inner workings of the ruling party Politburo, Gorbachev assured
them there was ``no danger of a coup or anything like that.''
   ``Let's end these rumors,'' he said. ``In four years, I have
already died seven times and my family was killed three times.''
   Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick former Moscow party chief, was
among those who argued that Gorbachev was accumulating too much
power. He said in the Congress last week the ``extraordinary
powers'' could lead to a ``new dictatorship.''
   Sakharov told the deputies Friday: ``I personally respect Mikhail
Sergeyevich Gorbachev very much, but it is dangerous to give so much
power even to the initiator of perestroika.''
   In a rousing speech on the final day, Gorbachev said he
understood the general dissatisfaction deputies had expressed, but
expressed confidence the session would move the country farther
``along the road of glasnost.''
   The new parliament's contentiousness reached an emotional peak
Thursday when about two dozen Baltic deputies stormed out.
   They left after objecting to formation of a committee to decide
whether laws conform to the constitution. They said the committee
might encroach on their republics' right to self-determination and
the right professed by Lithuania and Estonia to veto laws passed by
the central government.
   Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia were independent when the Soviet
Union absorbed them by force in 1940.
   Gorbachev asked the Congress on Friday to create a commission to
write a law on protecting the constitutionality of Soviet laws and
report to the fall session of the Congress. It passed with only 10
negative votes and 25 abstentions.
   Deputies also formed a commission, chaired by Gorbachev, to draft
a new constitution to replace the charter enacted in 1977.

<HEAD>Report: U.S. Weighs Using Military Against Foreign Drug Lords</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is considering using
the U.S. military, possibly including commando units, against drug
lords overseas as part of a broad campaign against narcotics
trafficking, according to a report published Friday.
   New guidelines to that effect, despite a 1976 presidential order
barring the U.S. government from assassinations abroad, are
contained in a draft national security directive awaiting action at
the White House, said the Miami Herald, in a report distributed by
the Knight-Ridder news service.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said he was not
familiar with the story, but he added: ``Assassinations are illegal.
We don't do assassinations.''
   The 1976 presidential directive forbids U.S. government personnel
from carrying out assassinations.
   The news report said that David C. Miller, a staff member of the
National Security Council at the White House, discussed the plan
with congressional aides. Miller referred all telephone calls to
Fitzwater's office Friday.
   The Knight-Ridder story quoted a senior administration official
as saying that a National Security Council team was considering
``military operations,'' including such efforts against ``high-value
targets.''
   One Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Friday that ``military operations'' could include such activities as
radio and telephone interceptions and aerial surveillance.
   A congressional aide said that the National Security Council
staff was drafting a directive to broaden the war on drugs.
   It would call for close cooperation with foreign countries where
drug traffickers operate, and would require the consent of those
governments before U.S. military force was used on their territory,
said the source, who spoke on condition he not be further identified.
   The document, which would elaborate on the directive signed by
then-President Ford on April 8, 1976, would also call for increased
financial assistance to Latin American countries were drugs
originate and for an expanded intelligence capacity against
traffickers, sources said.
   ``All policy options are being considered in our efforts to
combat drug trafficking, and more and more people are beginning to
view drug trafficking as a form of low intensity conflict,'' said
Raphael Perl, an attorney and specialist on international affairs at
the Congressional Research Service.
   ``People in policy positions in the administration are
considering a full range of options,'' said Perl.
   Asked whether the use of military force against drug lords might
be viewed as illegal, Perl said: ``There is no doubt that a reading
of the 1976 directive would give the impression that that was
illegal.''
   Other government lawyers have argued that the use of military
force against enemies in a low intensity conflict might not be
considered assassination.
   An Army attorney says that the term ``assassination'' refers to
the killing of political figures rather than drug traffickers.
   The Army's top lawyer, Maj. Gen. Hugh Overholt, has argued in an
eight-page memorandum that killing drug traffickers also would not
be classified as assassinations if U.S. military units rather than
covert agents were involved.
   The memo, drafted by another Army attorney, W. Hays Parks,
originated as a proposed section in an Army manual on international
law rather than as a policy initiative, according to Pentagon
officials. The memo is not classified and has been provided to
reporters.
   When asked to draw a distinction between assassinations of
foreign leaders and the killing of drug lords, Fitzwater said:
   ``Well, I don't know what the story is about. I haven't seen it.
But assassinations are illegal, and we are not involved in those.''

<TEXT>
   Construction began on a double-decker highway
Friday in an effort to ease one of the nation's worst commuter
traffic jams, but road work threatened to worsen the
bumper-to-bumper standstill called rush hour.
   Gov. George Deukmejian presided at a ceremonial dedication of the
overhead highway project dubbed ``The Second Generation of
Freeways.''
   Standing atop an unfinished freeway link that will give rise to
the top deck, Deukmejian praised the $530 million project, which
will cater to buses and carpools, as California's road to rational
commuting.
   ``The fact that we're holding this event on an onramp is
symbolic,'' he said, ``because it demonstrates our commitment not to
let traffic congestion force California onto an offramp in terms of
our prosperity in the future.''
   Car worship has caused mounting problems in Southern California,
where cruising is still king but frustration over snarled roadways
prompted a 1987 summer of freeway violence _ as angry motorists took
pot-shots at one another.
   ``We know that impatience and driver anger often result in
serious injuries,'' said Sgt. Mike Brey of the California Highway
Patrol.
   Urging everyone trapped in their ``Fast Car'' to ``Don't Worry,
Be Happy,'' K-EARTH radio disc jockey Steve Morris broadcast his
morning commute show from a Denny's restaurant in Hollywood, where
commuters were offered a complimentary meal.
   The new overhead project will link the Century Freeway still
under construction with exclusive carpool and bus lanes from the
heavily traveled Harbor Freeway, which links downtown to the city's
port district.
   The elevated sections of the Harbor Freeway Transitway will
stretch 2.6 miles and are scheduled to open in the fall of 1993.
   During construction, which takes place in the center of the
existing highway, some of the average 230,000 daily drivers are
bound to get testy during delays because the freeway already has a
50 percent higher accident rate than other Los Angeles freeways. As
a result, the time lost on the Harbor is 40 percent higher than
other freeways.
   Deukmejian said increasing reliance on mass transit and carpools
was the only way to solve the state's traffic problems.
   ``We cannot just build ourselves out of the problem.'' he said.
   Caltrans calls the overhead project the beginning of its second
generation because it involves expanding capacity without buying new
land, a feature likely to be used more and more as property values
soar, Deukmejian said.
   The overhead sections devoted solely to buses and other so-called
high-occupancy vehicles can also be converted to service a proposed
light rail line.
   To close the ceremonies, California Department of Transportation
officials made Deukmejian an honorary highway engineer and presented
him with a hardhat and a trademark Caltrans orange safety vest.
   But the governor didn't let the honor go to his head.
   ``This means I'm qualified to go pick up litter along the
freeways,'' he joked.
   The special K-EARTH radio show and broadcast site were staged as
part of Drivetime Day, decreed by Mayor Tom Bradley to emphasize a
citywide effort to promote commuter courtesy.

   Bargain-hunting motorists backed traffic up
five miles on the Golden Gate Bridge on Friday as they grabbed up
discount toll-fare books.
   With the discount books, the toll is $1.25. Without the discount,
tolls climb to $1.67 starting Monday.
   Traffic started backing up almost at dawn, said Lt. Don
Darrington. By 9 a.m., traffic was backed to Mill Valley in Marin
County.
   ``It's slow and go,'' said a bridge dispatcher, sitting among
fuming cars and drivers.
   Darrington said commuters were buying as many as four ticket
books at a time. The $1.25 discount books, while available only
through Sunday, are good through the end of the year.

<HEAD>Pentagon Critizes GAO Report on Aerial Drug Interdiction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials, disputing a congressional
report, said Friday that if Congress wants to fight illegal drug
imports more money must be spent on aerial interdiction efforts.
   They told a Senate panel the Defense Department wants to spend a
third of the $300 million it's getting to fight drugs this year to
add radar equipment and radar balloons known as aerostats that aid
surveillance along the nation's southern border.
   ``If you're going to put up a fence, the fence isn't very valid
until you get the whole thing up, because they keep coming through
the holes,'' said Army Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director of
operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Kelly criticized a report by Arnold P. Jones of the General
Accounting Office, the research branch of Congress, who said he
concluded from an 18-month study that spending more money on air
interdiction efforts would not substantially curtail drug
trafficking.
   Despite substantial drug seizures through aerial interdiction,
far more drugs are getting into the country, illustrated by greater
purity of drugs on the street, decreases in prices and hikes in
drug-related emergency room treatments, Jones told the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.
   ``We have to start looking for alternative approaches,'' Jones
said, noting that federal spending on air interdiction programs
increased from about $18 million in 1982 to about $204 million in
1989.
   Meanwhile, Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, proposed
creation of an international organization to coordinate drug
intelligence, interdiction and enforcement. Such a force, Manley
said, could be available to provide ``paramilitary muscle if a
problem in a particular country is that serious.''
   ``I would feel very good to know I could raise a hand and say:
`Come, please help me''' fight drug traffickers, Manley, who was in
Washington on a private visit, said at a press conference.
   Such a force would also train personnel from smaller nations, he
said.
   The principal U.S. radar network to detect airborne smugglers
uses five radars attached to tethered balloons, called aerostats, in
South Florida, the Bahamas and on the U.S.-Mexico border. The
Pentagon plans to add 11 more aerostats, and the cost for the six
aerostats not already funded and two long-range radar aircraft is at
least $124 million, Jones said.
   All air interdiction programs resulted in the seizure of about 28
tons of cocaine through 1987, but many of those resulted from
advance intelligence in which federal agents allowed the flights to
occur in order to make arrests, he said.
   ``There is a lot of legitimate air traffic along the border,''
said Jones. ``Technology, no matter how sophisticated, is never
going to say what is in that plane, what is in that vehicle.''
   Kelly acknowledged aerostats have had limited success thus far,
but said, ``Pretty obviously, that's because they're very easy at
this point to fly around.''
   And, he said, ``When we turn the radars on, whether it's in an
AWACS (surveillance plane) or it's in an aerostat (balloon), they
have fuzzbusters (radar detectors) in their aircraft and they just
turn around and don't come in.''
   Once more aerostats are up, he said, ``We will begin to make some
measurable progress. ... Even if we only ot 50 percent availability
of the aerostats ... that would be 50 percent of the time that we'd
have the fence up, and it would then allow us to concentrate our
other resources, such as AWACS ... to make it continually more
difficult for the drug traffickers to do business, to come into the
United States.''
   The Pentagon is getting $300 million for its part in the drug war
this year and wants to buy three more regular aerostats, one
semi-submersible vehicle with an aerostat, a ship with an aerostat
on it and a spare aerostat, Kelly said.
   Lt. Gen. Stephen G. Olmstead, deputy assistant secretary of
defense for drug policy and enforcement, said the Pentagon plans to
spend $100 million for various aerostats and radar support this year.
   Olmstead said the Pentagon's anti-drug spending plans also
include $100 million for its own detection and monitoring efforts,
$60 million for communications equipment to create a network linking
all federal drug enforcement efforts and $40 million for National
Guard operations, for which 49 plans have been approved so far.

   The U.S. government thinks the Palestine
Liberation Organization is examining the possibility of holding
elections in Israeli-occupied territories as a first step to peace
talks, an official said Friday.
   U.S. Ambassador Robert Pelletreau said on Thursday that he
devoted his third round of talks with PLO officials in Tunisia to
seeking acceptance of elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
proposed by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters on
Friday that she had little to add to what Pelletreau said after the
meeting.
   Ms. Tutwiler was asked whether the PLO had responded firmly to
whether it would allow Palestinians in the territories to discuss
the election proposal with Israel.
   ``We have made it very clear to them that the elections concept
offers the pathway to progress and that they should not impose
conditions upon it that would make it impossible to move ahead,''
she said.
   ``Based on the discussions that we have had (with PLO officials),
they have not, in our opinion, rejected the election concept,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said. ``Our view is that they will continue to explore the
elections concept.''

   Andrei D. Sakharov proposed in a nationally
televised speech in Congress on Friday his own bold program for
political reform that would abolish the Communist Party's legal
monopoly on power.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev interrupted Sakharov from the
dais, saying he had spoken twice as long as permitted, but the
68-year-old Nobel Peace laureate continued, raising his voice and
waving his arms.
   Sakharov, father of the Soviet human rights movement, told the
Congress of People's Deputies on the final day of its inaugural
session that it had failed in its main task _ ``to establish a
system of power to overcome economic and social problems and put an
end to ecological madness.''
   The standing legislature chosen by the 2,250-member Congress
contains ``more than 50 percent idle functionaries,'' he charged.
``So the Supreme Soviet will be used as a screen for the party and
the party apparatus.''
   He also said Congress did Communist Party chief Gorbachev a
disservice by electing him Soviet president when it convened May 25
without considering alternative candidates.
   ``In accordance with the Constitution, the (president) has
absolute personal power concentrated in the hands of one person,''
Sakharov said. ``I personally respect Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev
very much, but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the
initiator of perestroika.''
   Sakharov, elected to Congress from the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, proposed his own ``Decree on Power'' that would end the
monopoly on power the Communist Party has jealously guarded since
the 1917 Russian Revolution.
   He called for abolishing Article 6 of the Constitution, which
declares the 20-million member party ``the leading and guiding force
of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system'' and
gives the party the right to determine ``the general perspectives of
the development of society and the course of the domestic and
foreign policy of the U.S.S.R.''
   Sakharov's proposal would also empower Congress to appoint the
head of the KGB secret police, the editor of the government
newspaper Izvestia, the chief of the Gostelradio state broadcasting
authority and other top leadership figures.
   Sakharov said the Soviet president and those officials should
report to Congress alone to be ``independent from the party and the
party's bodies.''
   He said KGB functions should be limited ``to ensuring the
international security of the U.S.S.R.,'' which would mean an end to
its widespread spying activities on Soviet citizens.
   The activist, whom Gorbachev allowed to return to Moscow in
December 1986 after nearly seven years of forced exile in the closed
city of Gorky, asked Congress to form a committee to consider his
proposal and to adopt it at an extraordinary sesssion.
   He appealed on the live telecast for the support of the Soviet
people, ``as they have done when there was an attempt to discredit
Sakharov to divert attention from the problem of the Afghan war.''
   Sakharov's public criticism of the December 1979 Soviet military
push into Afghanistan prompted his being exiled and stripped of
medals and honors.
   Sakharov also proposed creating an ``equal federal system'' to
give the 15 constituent Soviet republics more rights and end decades
of top-heavy centralized control from Moscow.
   Gorbachev tried to cut Sakharov off when he complained that a
resolution adopted Tuesday by Congress on the recent violence in
Beijing ``did not fully reflect the depth of the problem.''
   The resolution called events in China, including the bloody army
attack on pro-democracy demonstrators, a purely ``internal affair.''
   Gorbachev told Sakharov he had already spoken twice as long as
permitted by Congress' rules.
   ``I respect Congress, but I respect the people who listen to
me,'' Sakharov answered from the rostrum. ``I respect humanity.''

<HEAD>Economists Say More Taxpayer Funds Needed for Brady Debt Plan</HEAD>

   The Bush administration's new debt-reduction
effort is likely to fail unless more taxpayer resources are
provided, an international research group said Friday.
   The report, prepared by the World Institute for Development
Economics Research, said any successful effort to tackle the debt
problem would need to slash the $370 billion owed by the 39 most
heavily indebted countries by $125 billion, a reduction of 33
percent.
   To accomplish this, the study said governments would need to put
up $50 billion as an enticement to commercial banks to participate
in the voluntary debt forgiveness program.
   By contrast, the debt reduction strategy unveiled by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady on March 10 called for a 20 percent
reduction in debt owed by the 39 largest debtor nations over a
three-year period. The 151-nation International Monetary Fund and
its sister lending organization, the World Bank, would put up
approximately $24 billion under that plan.
   The Brady initiative has been criticized by some who charge that
it represents a taxpayer-financed bailout for the world's large
commercial banks.
   But the new study argued that unless even more funds are
committed to the debt relief effort, there is a danger that heavily
indebted countries will simply default on their loans, forcing
commercial banks to take huge writeoffs, which would end up costing
taxpayers more.
   ``Accomplishing debt relief in an orderly way would reduce the
burden on taxpayers,'' said former IMF director Johannes Witteveen,
one of the authors of the report.
   Witteveen told reporters in Washington that one way to attract
larger resources to help write off the debt would be to have the IMF
set up a special trust fund and encourage countries with large trade
surpluses, such as Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and West Germany, to
contribute to the fund.
   The special IMF fund could be used to provide more incentives to
commercial banks to forgive a portion of their Third World loans.
The Brady plan envisions using the resources of the IMF and World
Bank to guarantee that the reduced level of debt will be repaid,
thus enticing banks to participate in the debt reduction effort.
   ``If these (debt-reduction) negotiations do not succeed, you
would get debt reduction in a disorderly way'' with wide ranging
defaults by debtor nations, Witteveen said. ``That would be more
harmful to the world financial system.''
   Among participants in the group which produced the study were
former French Prime Minister Raymond Barre and Robert Solow, Nobel
prize-winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   The World Institute for Development Economics Research,
affiliated with the United Nations University, was established in
Helsinki in 1985 to study world economic problems.

   Mobs with guns, Molotov cocktails and pitchforks
have seized several police stations in Soviet Uzbekistan and show no
signs of ending a week-long frenzy of arson and murder, Soviet media
reported Friday.
   The death toll from Uzbek-Turkish violence in the Fergana region
of the Central Asian republic is nearing 80, and more than 800
people have been injured, the government newspaper Izvestia said.
   Mobs of more than 5,000 people have been on a destructive rampage
in the city of Kokand, according to the official media.
   Fighting began June 3 between ethnic Uzbeks and members of the
Meskhi Turk minority who were forcibly resettled in the Fergana
Valley by the late dictator Josef Stalin in 1944. Reports said
rioters have burned more than 550 houses and nearly 300 vehicles,
most owned by Turks, and 300 people have been detained.
   About 9,000 internal-security troops have been sent to the area.
   Moscow's evening news program Vremya said the troops are in
control in the regional center of Fergana but cannot restore order
elsewhere. ``Frankly speaking, police don't have enough force to
stop all the violence,'' the commentator said.
   In Kokand, 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, ``a militant mob .. .
is freely moving around the place, setting houses on fire, stoning
trains, mutilating and killing,'' Vremya reported. Videotapes showed
crowds blocking railroad tracks and buildings in flames. It said
from 5,000 to 6,000 people were massed at the local police station.
   The youth newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said mobs in Kokand
stormed most of the police stations and also seized three
locomotives. Rioters were threatening to blow up ailroad fuel tanks,
it said.
   Interior Minister Gen. Y. V. Shatalin told Vremya that Friday
afternoon about 5,000 ``extremist youths'' attacked government
office buildings and Turkish neighborhoods in Kokand.
   ``For the first time we saw a great number of automatic firearms
carried by the attackers,'' Shatalin said. He did not say where they
might have obtained the weapons.
   He said about 100 people suffered gunshot woundes.
   A Vremya correspondent in Kokand said Interior Ministry troops
were firing into the air to try to disperse the mob and ``shots are
heard from the crowd.''
   In Tashlak ``a wild mob, incited by extremists, tried several
times to occupy an administration building and inflict reprisals on
women and children of the Turkish nationality,'' the military
newspaper Krasnaya Zvezda said. ``The hooligans used bottles filled
with fuel, firearms, rocks, pitchforks and other objects.''
   Izvestia said, ``The actions of uncontrolled elements are
becoming more aggressive. More and more often attacks are being made
on buildings of the Interior Ministry and police. The goal is to
seize weapons. The population is extremely agitated.''
   Shavkat Yuldashev, the Fergana region's Communist Party chief,
told Izvestia ``we don't have enough force yet for its
stabilization'' and he called for ``more decisive measures.''
   But the nation's new parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies, did not discuss the Uzbekistan violence in its televised
public sessions Friday, the final day of its session. Authorities
have not announced reinforcements for troops in the area.
   The newspaper Trud said many of the Kokand ``hooligans'' arrived
in the city of more than 150,000 in organized columns of cars from
other regions of the cotton-growing valley.
   ``The extremists' activities have confirmed they are not
nationalistic riots by separate groups of youth but well-organized
and controlled political actions,'' Shatalin said. ``Apparently many
dislike what is happening in our country now and in particular in
Uzbekistan.''
   He apparently referred to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform
programs, which have included a campaign against corruption in
Uzbekistan. Many government and party officials have been accused of
taking bribes and fired.
   The violence is the latest in a series of ethnic disputes in the
southern Soviet Union, where confrontations in the Caucasus region
and in Central Asia have killed scores of people and left thousands
homeless.
   Uzbeks are hanging red cloths on their homes so the mobs would
know they are not Turks, said Nazgi Mir Vagir-Zade, a 31-year-old
teacher and Meskhi Turk in Moscow to appeal for help.
   Officials said more than 10,000 Meskhi Turks have been evacuated
to army camps.
   The Meskhi Turks were forcibly resettled from Soviet Georgia,
near the Turkish border, during World War II.

   The Air Force on Friday narrowed its search for
40 radio tower sites needed to complete a ``doomsday'' radio
network, announcing construction was envisioned from Maine to
Georgia and from Virginia to California.
   In all, 26 states will probably have one or more of the final 40
towers, the Air Force said.
   The service, through its Electronic Systems Division at Hanscomb
Air Force Base, Mass., said it had selected sections of the various
states where a tower would be needed, but not the specific sites.
   The Air Force said it would spend the next year conducting
environmental studies, holding public hearings and picking the
specific 11-acre tracts needed within each state section. Only when
a specific site is approved after the environmental process can
construction of the low-power, low-frequency radio towers begin, the
service said.
   The Ground Wave Emergency Network _ known as GWEN _ is an
automated system of radio transmitters designed to ensure adequate
communication links for military forces in time of war. If there's a
nuclear war, the satellite, telephone and radio links now used for
military communications would likely be destroyed or disrupted.
   The Air Force already is building a ``thin line'' GWEN system
across the country consisting of 56 radio relay towers that link 38
terminals at military bases. The thin line system _ 52 of the 56
towers have been built _ looks like a giant ``8'' stretched across
the country, with the center at the Strategic Air Command
headquarters at Omaha, Neb.
   Friday's announcement by the Air Force finally completes the
picture of how the emergency war-fighting network will look when the
final ``offshoots'' or radio paths are added to the ``8'' to link
more SAC bases to the system.
   The service hopes to have all 96 radio towers operating by early
1992. The system carries a price tag of between $600 million and
$700 million.
   The work is ``an integral part of the Strategic Modernization
Program begun by former President Reagan,'' the Air Force said.
``This system will ensure that vital messages flow to top military
leaders and operational forces.''
   According to Friday's announcement, the Air Force expects to
build new towers in the Northeast and South in the following areas:
southwestern and central Maine; eastern Pennsylvania; western
Maryland; central and western Virginia; central North Carolina;
northwestern Georgia; eastern and central Tennessee; central
Kentucky and southern Arkansas.
   In the Midwest, the service said towers will be needed in central
Ohio; northwestern Indiana; central Michigan; north central
Wisconsin; central Minnesota; north central South Dakota;
northwestern Nebraska; north central Iowa, and northeastern and
southern Missouri.
   And in the West, the Air Force said towers would be needed in
central, northeast and north central Texas; southwest, south central
and northwest Colorado; southern and central Utah; central, southern
and northeastern Nevada; northern California; southeastern Idaho;
central Wyoming, and southeastern, northeastern, south central and
western Montana.
   A typical GWEN station consists of a thin, 300-foot tower and
three small shelters surrounded by a fence. The shelters house
electronic equipment and an emergency generator and fuel. The
stations normally require a 700-foot square parcel of land _ about
11 acres.
   Each GWEN antenna is connected to a small grid of copper wire
buried underground at its base and operates with 2,000 to 3,000
watts of power. The towers must be located with 200 miles of each
other.
   Some of the towers in the thin-line system prompted public
controversy, with citizen groups in such states as Massachusetts,
Oregon, Pennsylvania and California banding together to fight GWEN
on grounds the towers increased the likelihood of their towns
becoming nuclear targets.
   The Air Force has dismissed such arguments, asserting the
isolated, 300-foot GWEN towers are not tempting enough to be
targeted.

<HEAD>President Rules Out Midterm Referendum</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo has ruled out a
promised referendum on his administration because it might cause
unrest, and he will complete his five-year term, the head of the
governing party said Friday.
   Park Jyun-kyu, chairman of the Democratic Justice Party, also
told The Associated Press in an interview the gradual withdrawal of
U.S. forces from South Korea could begin in 1992 if the government
is confident it can defend itself against communist North Korea.
   ``We're excluding any possibility of a national referendum,''
Park said. ``The president is going to perform his duties up to the
last day of his term. We feel that's what the majority of the people
want.''
   Before the presidential election in December 1987, Roh promised
to hold a referendum on his performance after the Olympic Games were
held in Seoul in September 1988. The former general won the election
when rival candidates split the opposition vote.
   He postponed the referendum in March, saying it could create a
major political confrontation. Some opposition leaders had said Roh
must resign if he lost the referendum.
   Park said the government was not ruling out referendums on major
issues, but there would be no vote requiring Roh to resign if the
government lost. He said polls clearly showed public opposition to a
referendum.
   The party chairman also said public opposition to dissidents was
growing and the dissidents were losing strength. He said the
government had cracked down because the dissidents because were a
violent threat to the government and the public needed reassurance.
   On Friday, riot police used tear gas and clubs to disperse
radical students demanding to take part in a youth festival in
communist North Korea. About 300 arrests were reported.
   Park said he saw little hope for a quick end to confrontation
with the communist North, and recent South Korean efforts to improve
relations made no substantial progress.
   ``We were too unrealistic,'' he said.
   The Korean peninsula has been divided since 1945. The North
invaded the South in 1950, starting the three-year Korean war.
   Park said he favors a long-term U.S. military presence, but
gradual withdrawal could begin in 1992 if South Korea is able to
defend itself. Some dissidents have demanded expulsion of the 43,000
American soldiers.

   A man shocked by 7,200 volts of electricity
was pronounced dead and lay with a sheet over him in a hospital for
40 minutes Friday. Then a nurse saw him breathing.
   ``I've never seen anything like that because he was dead,'' said
Dr. Phillip Bortmes, one of the emergency team who worked 45 minutes
on veterinarian Jerry Middleswart before pronouncing him dead.
   Two monitors showed Middleswart was dead. His wife had gone home.
Friday night he was listed in serious but stable condition at St.
John's Regional Medical Center in Joplin.
   Bortmes ``has been 15 years in the profession and has never seen
anything like this happen,'' said Jim Vietti, administrator at
Oswego. ``The nurses said the same thing. ... I don't know if you
call it a miracle or what you call it.''
   Middleswart and six other men were electrified when a radio tower
they were erecting near his veterinary clinic contacted a power
line. One man, Jesse Nash, was killed. The others were burned on
their hands and feet.
   ``Everybody froze to the tower,'' said Larry Taylor, one of the
shock victims. ``I fell away first, and had just enough left in me
to watch each fall away gradually from the tower.''
   Taylor was the only one left conscious. He called for help and
began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation to the others.
   After co-workers arrived, Taylor drove Middleswart and Nash to
the hospital. The injured men were listed in stable condition at
Oswego.

   Rain prevailed across the East on Friday and thunderstorms, some
of them severe, rumbled along the southern Atlantic Coast.
   A tornado touched down near Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta,
Ga., but no damages or injuries were reported. Flash flood warnings
issued for extreme southeast Georgia after storms dumped more than 3
inches of rain on Thursday and Friday.
   Storms also created conditions favorable to tornadoes in eastern
parts of the Carolinas and portions of northern Florida.
Thunderstorms also occurred over the eastern Great Lakes, with
strong ones over southeast Lower Michigan.
   Amherst, N.Y., near Buffalo, received 2.3 inches of rain in 30
minutes, flooding intersections, yards and basements.
   Rain extended from eastern Ohio across Pennsylvania, northern
Maryland, New Jersey and southeast New York to southern New England.
   Flood watches were posted for parts of southern New England,
southeast New York, including New York City, northern New Jersey and
the Philadelphia area.
   A flash flood watch issued for western Oklahoma, including the
Oklahoma City area.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended across western portions of the
central and southern Plains, and through the Colorado mountains.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
more than an inch and a half at Tallahassee, Fla., and more than an
inch at Valdosta, Ga., Columbia, S.C., and Salisbury, Md.
   Wisconsin and adjacent states had a chilly afternoon, with
temperatures at 2 p.m. CDT just 56 degrees at Dubuque, Iowa, and 52
degrees at Wausau, Wis.
   Cloudy skies and some thunderstorms kept readings down into the
60s throughout northwest Texas.
   Sunshine prevailed west of the Rockies. Temperatures ranged from
the 50s to lower 60s along the Pacific Coast and over western
Washington to the 90s in portions of the desert Southwest.
   Record low temperatures for the date were Huron, S.D., 34
degrees; Kansas City, Mo., 52; Norfolk, Neb., 40; and Yankton, S.D.,
41.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 47
degrees at Ironwood, Mich., to 97 degrees at Needles, Calif. The
nation's low Friday morning was 32 degrees at Watertown, S.D., and
International Falls, Minn.
   The forecast for Saturday called for showers and thunderstorms
from Florida across the Gulf Coast, Plains and northern and central
Rockies westward toward the mountains of Nevada, Oregon and
Washington. Rain and a few thunderstorms were expected over much of
New York and New England.
   Most of the nation was forecast to have high temperatures in the
70s and 80s. Readings should be in the 60s in Maine and Upper
Michigan and along most of the Pacific Coast, and 90s from Florida
across portions of the Gulf Coast, Texas and southern New Mexico and
Arizona to the interior valleys of California. Scattered readings
over 100 were predicted along the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and in
the desert Southwest.

will there be peace.''
   ``The president noted a pattern of violence against government
officials in El Salvador by those who seek to destroy the democratic

   Leaders of the U.S. higher-education community
on Friday urged Chinese officials to keep soldiers off campuses and
refrain from reprisals against students and scholars involved in
pro-democracy protests.
   The leaders of six associations representing more than 3,000 U.S.
colleges and universities also urged President Bush to act promptly
on visa extensions for Chinese students and scholars in the United
States and explore the possibility of federal help for those who may
face an end to support from the Chinese government.
   In a letter to Li Tie Ying, chairman of the the State Education
Commission in Beijing, the education leaders called on Chinese
officials to prevent further bloodshed ``and find ways to resolve
differences peacefully.''
   ``We urge Chinese leaders, including the leadership of the
People's Liberation Army, not to send troops into university
campuses, and to refrain from punitive actions and harsh measures
against members of the academic community,'' the letter said.
   Robert Atwell, president of the American Council on Education,
said he delivered the letter to Ni Mengxiong, the minister-counselor
for education affairs at the Chinese Embassy here.
   He told reporters that the recent military crackdown in which
hundreds and possibly thousands of people were killed poses a
serious threat to relations between U.S. and Chinese universities.
   ``These relations have painstakingly and productively evolved
since President Nixon's visit to China. There's no question that
what has happened there has created a lot of damage that will last
for a long time,'' said Atwell.
   Allan Ostar, president of the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities, said his group has canceled all exchanges
with China, including a delegation of university presidents that had
been scheduled to leave for China on June 25 and plans to send
English teachers to various Chinese provinces.
   In a telex to Li, the State Education Commission chairman, Ostar
said his association felt ``revulsion and outrage toward the
atrocities committed by the People's Liberation Army. ... Given
these deplorable acts we have no choice but to suspend all exchange
activities until a responsible government with a respect for its
people and for its educational institutions is restored.''
   However, some groups are still hoping to go ahead with exchange
plans for the fall and a symposium next summer in California,
officials said. Atwell said there were about 1,000 U.S. students and
teachers in China before the crackdown.
   There are 40,000 Chinese students and scholars attending or
working at U.S. colleges and universities, according to Atwell. Many
of their visas are expiring as the school year ends and they are in
need of immediate advice on how to get extensions.
   The education leaders urged Bush, in a letter, to instruct the
Justice Department to promptly advise the visiting students and
scholars on how to apply for one-year extensions and decide by Dec.
30 whether to make the one-year extensions indefinite.
   They also asked the president to make temporary changes enabling
the academic visitors to get or keep jobs here. And they urged
consideration of emergency funds for those who depend on support
from the Chinese government and may face delays or cutoffs of funds.
About one-quarter of the 40,000 depend on such support, Atwell said.
   Those signing the letters to Li and Bush were Atwell, Ostar and
leaders of the Association of American Universities; the National
Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges; the
American Association of Community and Junior Colleges; and the
National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities.

   The largest Newark anywhere held a reunion
Friday for its namesakes around the world, stretching from
California to South Africa to the English mother of them all _
Newark-on-Trent.
   ``We're proud of each other and we're inspired by each other,''
said Sharpe James, mayor of Newark, N.J. ``Now we're talking to each
other and learning _ and I guess trying to outdo each other.''
   The reunion of municipalities named Newark originated about two
years ago in California, when that state's Newark gathered eight
cities with the same name.
   Officials in New Jersey's largest city thought they could do
better and did, finding 29. They were in Brazil and Vermont,
Arkansas and Maryland, Delaware and Illinois. They looked in their
backyard and found Newark, N.Y., and East Newark, N.J., and looked
down under and found Newark, Australia.
   Meg Glover is the city clerk of the smallest Newark, the one in
Missouri, population 105.
   ``We fluctuate a little bit as people die and people are born,''
Ms. Glover said. ``But I don't expect it's changed much since I
left.''
   Ms. Glover said talking with Newarkers from around the world has
shown her that people share the same problems everywhere. In her
small town, 35 miles north of Hannibal, Mo., residents are grappling
with some of the same pressures as Newark, Ohio.
   ``We had a problem, that we didn't have housing for the
elderly,'' Ms. Glover said. ``Now we have eight units. That's a lot
for us.''
   The Newark in California also had a problem. Although it now
celebrates its name and its heritage, the city once considered
calling itself Newark of Bay so it wouldn't be so closely identified
with Newark, N.J., a city of 330,000 that has been maligned for its
problems with poverty and crime.
   ``That idea's dead now,'' said Nita Clendenning, who helped
organize the first convention in the Newark 30 miles north of San
Francisco. ``We met people from New Jersey and we liked them and
said, `Hey, why should we change our name? Those people are just
like us.' Now having been here, I can go back and tell them we were
right. We're Newark and we're proud of that.''
   All the Newarks can trace their name to Newark-on-Trent, a city
of about 22,000 in the English countryside about 100 miles from
London. From that city came the Rev. Abraham Peirson, the first
priest of the First Presbyterian Church and one of the original
settlers in Newark, N.J.
   John Baker, a celebrant from the Sherwood District Council in
Newark, England, said Newarks around the world deserve recognition.
   ``We have Sherwood Forest in our district and we used to make a
pretty good beer,'' Baker said. ``We have a lot to be proud of.''
   Mayor James claims all the Newarks in the United States and
Newark, South Africa, were named by adventurers who roamed from his
New Jersey city, which was settled in 1666.
   The reunion, continuing through the weekend, was timed to
coincide with the Portuguese Day parade, and the visiting Newarks
will be honored with a float.
   ``We're wondering if we could host one of these reunions some
day,'' said Ms. Glover, the Newark, Mo., town clerk. ``We couldn't
put on the kind of show New Jersey or California has, but we'd sure
make them feel right at home.''

   British officials on Friday urged that Hong Kong
send home most Vietnamese boat people, whose latest influx is
creating a second crisis for the British colony deeply worried about
coming under Chinese rule in 1997.
   In Hong Kong, legislators said Friday that London's policy of
allowing only some Hong Kong citizens the right to emigrate to
Britain is ``no longer adequate.''
   With boat people arriving at a record rate of 500 a day, ``public
opinion in Hong Kong is very frustrated,'' said Geoffrey Barnes, the
colony's British secretary of security. ``They see no end to it.
Hong Kong has had enough.
   ``We believe ... that mandatory repatriation of all non-refugees
is a logical and essential consequence of screening,'' he said at a
news conference.
   Hong Kong has 42,766 Vietnamese boat people, one third of whom
arrived this year. Barnes said all but 14,150 were categorized as
simply seeking a better way of life, as opposed to being political
refugees.
   The British government said Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe
will visit Hong Kong early next month in an attempt to restore
confidence.
   Aides said that, among other things, Howe will discuss a
relaxation of emigration rules to give a greater number of the 3.2
million Hong Kong Chinese with British passports the right to
emigrate to Britain.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher this week ruled out an open-door
policy but promised greater flexibility, particularly for public
servants and people with private incomes.
   British newspapers reported that all 180,000 Hong Kong civil
servants and up to 50,000 retired civil servants and businessmen and
their families will be given the right to come to Britain.
   But Hong Kong legislators said increased flexibility ``is no
longer adequate.''
   ``Britain has a fundamental moral duty to extend the right to
abode to all the British nationals in Hong Kong,'' said a statement
by the lawmakers.
   The declaration came a day after Mrs. Thatcher rejected a similar
appeal by Hong Kong Governor Sir David Wilson during an emergency
meeting in London.
   The crackdown in China on pro-democracy students has increased
fears China will renege on an agreement to preserve Hong Kong's
capitalist system for 50 years after it takes over the territory,
now an important financial center.
   Britain is now simply hoping that the aging hard-liners now in
charge in Beijing will be gone before 1997 and that China will want
to keep Hong Kong capitalist for its own benefit.
   ``Economic self-interest will surely reassert itself'' in China,
British Trade and Industry Secretary Lord Young said Friday in an
address to a Hong Kong Chinese group in London. But he added:
``These are dark and still early days. I have for you ... no easy
reassurances.''
   A conference in Geneva next week on refugees, to be attended by
United Nations representatives and Southeast Asian countries, is
expected to agree on tough screening procedures for boat people but
stop short of forced repatriation.

<HEAD>Jury Awards $1 Million To Woman In Videotaped Sex Case</HEAD>

   A jury awarded $1 million Friday to a woman who
said she suffered grave mental anguish after learning that her
college boyfriend had secretly videotaped them having sex and shown
the tape to others.
   ``We just feel wonderful,'' said Ronald Krist, who represented
23-year-old Susan Kerr in a lawsuit seeking $48 million in damages.
   ``You know, this lawsuit was never about money. It was about a
definition of who was the victim and who was the culprit,'' he said.
``We undertook a jury to help cleanse our reputation and that was
done.''
   The jury of seven women and five men said the ex-boyfriend and
three other defendants had acted with gross negligence. The four
were assessed $500,000 in compensatory damages for pain and
suffering and an additional $500,000 in punitive damages.
   Ms. Kerr, who testified during the trial that the tape and the
ensuing gossip it caused affected her health and her studies, said
she accomplished what she wanted.
   ``The purpose was to know and let other people know that I wasn't
wrong in what I did,'' Ms. Kerr said. ``I never did anything wrong.
What they did to me was wrong.''
   The largest share of damages was $350,000 assessed against Dan
Boyles, 21, who admitted appearing in the videotape having sex with
Ms. Kerr and showing the tape to at least 10 fellow students at the
University of Texas at Austin.
   Other defendants and damages were: Karl Broesche, at whose house
the filming took place, $100,000; John Paul Tamborello, $25,000; and
Wray Widner, $25,000.
   Boyles' attorney, Jaime Drabek, said he was surprised by the
amount of damages but pleased the jury did not award the full amount
sought by Ms. Kerr.
   Drabek said he expected the jury to assess some liability, but
not to find there was gross negligence.
   ``This was an impromptu, stupid, immature and adolescent
mistake,'' Drabek said. But he added that the matter would have been
better solved between all the parents, not by the court.
   Drabek said he was not sure yet whether the verdict would be
appealed. Attorneys for the other defendants could not be reached by
telephone in their offices Friday afternoon.

   NATO allies promised Friday to increase
their annual defense budgets to retain a strong military stance
while awaiting an accord with the East to cut conventional forces in
Europe.
   Defense ministers said they will seek increases of 3 percent
discounting inflation. The goal dates to 1977 although many of the
Western alliance's 16 members, including the United States, have
never achieved or sustained it.
   ``Notwithstanding the announced unilateral reductions in Warsaw
Pact forces and the possibility of future arms control agreements, a
very considerable imbalance remains between the forces of the Warsaw
Pact and NATO,'' Western defense ministers said in statement after a
two-day meeting.
   ``The target of a real increase in defense expenditure of the
order of 3 percent should, in the absence of tangible improvement in
the balance of forces, serve as a general guide.''
   In Vienna, NATO ambassadors proposed an unprecedented exchange of
information among East, West and neutral nations about military
forces in Europe. The proposal, made at talks between 35 nations on
building confidence on European security, calls for a data bank that
would make available details on armed forces and weapons deployment,
arms procurement and other matters.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters in Brussels,
``If we reach an agreement for reductions in armaments on both sides
to equal levels, there will still be the need for modernizing these
forces.''
   He said the prospect of reducing conventional forces in Europe,
being negotiated in Vienna, is no reason to relax defense spending.
   NATO in December listed alliance nations whose defense efforts
were considered insufficient, fueling criticism by U.S. lawmakers
who believe the United States pays too great a share for Europe's
security.
   Cheney said the United States will not reach the 3 percent target
in higher defense spending in the next fiscal year, but stressed
this would not undermine U.S. commitments in Europe.
   At the meeting, Cheney discussed President Bush's proposal to
remove 30,000 U.S. troops and 325,000 Soviet soldiers from Europe,
and reduce aircraft fleets by 15 percent _ NATO's by 750 planes and
the Warsaw Pact's by 3,000.
   He said the aircraft reductions would not include British and
French planes able to carry conventional and nuclear arms.
   Cheney said he assured Western allies that Washington will not
withdraw from Europe 72 F-16 jetfighters in Spain. The planes, which
Cheney called ``absolutely vital to the defense'' of NATO's southern
flank, are to go to Italy when Spain ends an accord with the United
States.
   The proposed aircraft cuts would leave NATO and the seven-nation
East bloc each with roughly 4,600 combat aircraft in Europe, NATO
sources said.
   Bush proposed last week that the East and West agree in six to 12
months to the cuts and others proposed in Vienna for tanks, armored
personnel carriers and artillery pieces. NATO-Warsaw Pact talks
began in Vienna this year.
   Cheney called the timetable optimistic.
   ``But I think it is well worth our making that effort,'' he said.
``There is a real sense of momentum now.''
   The defense ministers said raising defense budgets by 3 percent a
year must remain a goal.
   ``There was broad agreement that sound defenses are constantly
kept up to date,'' said NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner of
West Germany.
   He said the Warsaw Pact retains roughly a 2-to-1 superiority over
NATO in conventional forces.
   Woerner said recently announced Soviet troop withdrawals from
Eastern Europe ``have still to be fully implemented'' and Soviet
military production remains ``very high.''
   In December, Gorbachev said 50,000 Red Army troops would be
withdrawn from East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary by the end
of 1990. He also has announced that 500 short-range nuclear missiles
will be removed from Europe.
   The Vienna proposal was presented by the Netherlands on behalf of
NATO at a closed session of the conference attended by the United
States and Canada, the Soviet Union and all European nations except
Albania.
   They are discussing confidence and security-building measures to
verify and enhance agreements reached at the parallel Vienna talks
between the NATO and seven Warsaw Pact nations on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   The Western alliance proposes each country:
   _Provide information by Dec. 15 each year on weapons procurement
programs for the following year and exact deployment of troops down
to regiment or brigade level and their peacetime strength and
equipment.
   _Submit at seven days' notice to at least three inspections a
year.
   _Give more exact information about maneuvers and advance notice
of all maneuvers involving 50,000 troops or more.
   _Improve working facilities for inspectors, observation of
maneuvers and for foreign military attaches and journalists.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Some Crib Deaths are Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A pediatrician said in an article published Friday
that up to 10 percent of babies thought to be ``crib death'' victims
probably were killed by their mothers.
   The article by Professor Roy Meadow, head of pediatrics and child
health at St. James's University Hospital, Leeds, appeared in the
British Medical Journal.
   Meadow wrote that from 2 percent to 10 percent of the deaths
attributed to sudden infant death syndrome ``have probably been
smothered by their mothers.''
   ``Some mothers smother their child when they are feeling a
violent hatred toward their baby,'' he wrote. ``Others do it in a
repetitive systematic way, taking their child regularly to the
doctor each time they have smothered their child for long enough to
make him or her unconscious.''
   Dr. Pamela Davies, of the Foundation for the Study of Infant
Deaths, said the organization had always recognized that some crib
deaths may have been caused by adults, but she thought a figure of
10 percent was highly unlikely.
   Meadow said many crib death victims have suffered recurrent
episodes of respiratory arrest or seizures that may have been
investigated, but doctors may not have considered the possibility of
child abuse.
   ``Asphyxia is an uncommon but serious form of child abuse,''
Meadow wrote.
   ``The commonest form is smothering, and the abuser is usually the
child's mother, who uses her hand, a pad of rolled-up clothing, or a
pillow to obstruct the child's air passages.
   ``Less commonly she presses the child's face against her chest,
encloses the child's head in a plastic bag, or strangles by pressure
on the child's neck.''
   He added: ``A young child who cannot breathe struggles and tries
to get air. The smothering needs considerable force, even when a
child is young. Despite the obvious violence entailed the signs may
be very few.''

   President Bush is expected to propose
legislation requiring a 10 million-ton reduction in sulfur dioxide
emissions by the year 2000 to combat acid rain, administration and
congressional sources said Friday.
   The new acid-rain standards _ not quite as extensive as the 12
million-ton cut sought by environmentalists but far more rigid than
industry has wanted _ are expected to be a key component in a
clean-air package Bush will unveil on Monday.
   The sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also said
that Bush's package likely would give industries that use clean-coal
technology additional time and flexibility in meeting the standards.
   The legislation will not mandate how industrial plants should go
about reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, giving them the choice of
methods, the sources said.
   And the package will offer special credits and other financial
incentives to industries that surpass the standards, the sources
said.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that Bush had
made some ``preliminary decisions'' on the clean-air package, but
would make up his mind on some of the thornier issues this weekend
while at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.
   ``He is taking with him decision memos and options on all the
major questions that are still outstanding, and we would expect
decisions over the weekend,'' Fitzwater said.
   It was unclear Friday on how the cuts would be distributed
nationwide, but the president was expected to include a proposal
where a utility excceeding the required reductions could sell
credits to one that had not, permitting the buying to utility to
comply.
   Several sources said the president was provided options that
ranged from forcing the 20 dirtiest plants to come up with most of
the early emission reductions to forcing smaller cuts on 107 plants
across the country.
   The president is expected to propose a system by which a utility
that exceeds the reduction requirements may sell credits to another
that has not, bringing the buying utility into compliance.
   American Electric Power, which operates in parts of Ohio,
Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan and West Virginia, said Friday if the
20-plant option is adopted, it would be forced to raise residential
electric rates to to its customers from 15 to 25 percent.
   ``The cost of such emission reductions will grind the economies
of the Midwestern states. Our heavy industries which rely upon low
energy costs ... would be devastated,'' maintained A. Joseph Dowd,
senior vice president. of American Electric Power.
   Among the decisions still to be resolved, presumably, are whether
Bush's package _ billed in advance as the most comprehensive
overhaul yet of the 19-year-old Clean Air Act _ will set new
standards for automobile tailpipe exhausts.
   Environmentalists want a requirement that tailpipe emissions of
hydrocarbons and nitrogen dioxide _ which were last reduced in 1981
_ be further reduced by 1993. The automobile industry has voiced
strong objections to any further tightening of the standards.
   Administration officials, perhaps signaling a decision against
tighter tailpipe standards, have stressed in recent days that the
Bush package would put heavy emphasis on alternate auto fuels _ such
as alcohol blends _ that contain fewer contaminants.
   The president also is considering a reduction in nitrogen oxide
emissions, another component of acid rain which primarily comes from
both electric utility plants and automobiles. Options prepared by
the Domestic Policy Council suggested that annual nitrogen oxide
emissions be cut by 2 million to 4 million tons, roughly 10 percent
to 20 percent.
   Nitrogen oxidens are transformed into nitric acid in the
atmosphere, a minority component in acid rain in the East but
nonetheless suspected by many scientists of helping damaqe
high-altitude forests through over-fertilization.
   The president is expected to promote the alternate fuels section
of his bill on Tuesday in a speech at the University of Nebraska in
Lincoln. It's the second day of a two-day Western trip to showcase
the new package.
   He visits Yellowstone National Park on Monday, and gives a talk
on the clean-air package Tuesday morning at the Teton Science School
at Jackson Hole, Wyo.
   The clean-air bill, which Bush on Thursday declared would benefit
the quality of life of every North American, will have three
sections _ dealing with acid rain, urban smog and chemical pollution.
   Sources have said that the section on chemical pollution would
set tough new requirements that would affect hundreds of categories
of businesses, from paint plants to bakeries.
   Cutting sulfur dioxide in the air by 10 million tons by the year
2000, as Bush was expected to recommend, would reduce the
contaminant to roughly half its current level.
   Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide, an ingredient of
smokestack emissions from coal-burning utilities and industries,
combines with water in the atmosphere and clouds to form acid which
then returns to Earth in rain and snow.
   Midwestern utilities that burn high-sulfur coal without cleanup
technology are generally agreed to be the chief source of the acid
rain that damages sensitive lakes, streams and aquatic life in
Canada and the Northeast.
   Bush, in his 1989 budget document to Congress, said his
administration was ``committed to ending the long debate on acid
rain.''
   The president also agreed previously to a $5 billion, five-year
joint study with Canada on finding ways to develop cleaner-burning
coal.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno said Friday that Japan's
past militarism was responsible for causing hardships in Korea and
elsewhere in Asia before World War II and that Japan should reflect
on its role in that war.
   The war issue has been sensitive here since Japan drew a storm of
criticism from its Asian neighbors in the late 1970s when it revised
school textbooks in what critics called an effort to gloss over its
militaristic past.
   In February, Uno's predecessor, Noboru Takeshita, drew fire from
China, South Korea and others by saying Japan's responsibility for
the war ``will have to be decided by future historians.''
   Uno, speaking at a Parliament session, said Friday in response to
a question from a Communist Party lawmaker: ``We must reflect on our
past, including the dark history involving Korea and others.''
   ``We must reflect on the dark history of (Japan's) 36-year
colonial rule of Korea. ... We must reflect on the past war,'' Kyodo
news service quoted Uno as saying.
   Japan annexed Korea and ruled the peninsula as a colony from
1910-45, and invaded China and other Asian countries before and
during World War II.
   Many Asian critics complain that school textbooks here, which
must be approved by the government, deliberately whitewash Japan's
military role and responsibility in the war.
   Uno defended instructions issued in February by the Education
Ministry that require schools to use the ``rising-sun'' flag and
play the semi-official anthem ``Kimigayo'' at school ceremonies.
Neither has been legally adopted, and both remain controversial
because they were symbols of militarism.
   Uno said the flag and anthem have been accepted by the people as
a result of long tradition and should be used in schools.
   The Japan Teachers' Union denounced the ministry measure, calling
it a move aimed at reviving nationalism.

   The Justice Department's antitrust division
recommended Friday that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh allow the
two competing daily newspapers in York, Pa. to form a joint
operating agreement.
   The antitrust division, in the report to Thornburgh, said the
York Daily Record qualified for an antitrust exemption under the
Newspaper Preservation Act because it showed ``no substantial
prospect'' of reversing a decade of losses totaling $2.4 million.
   Michael Boudin, acting assistant attorney general for antitrust,
recommended that Thornburgh allow the Daily Record to merge its
commercial and production facilities with the evening York Dispatch,
which was purchased last year by Garden State Newspapers, Inc.
   Boudin's recommendations will be open for public comment for one
month. The attorney general would then decide whether to allow
formation of a joint operating agreement.
   The proposed joint operating agreement calls for the Record to be
published mornings from Monday through Saturday while the Dispatch
would publish evening editions during the week.
   The Record's Sunday edition would give way to the Sunday News, a
paper recently started by the Dispatch under the proposed
arrangement. The Dispatch would discontinue its Saturday evening
edition.
   Boudin, who recommended against holding a hearing, noted in his
report that the Record has slowly boosted its circulation and
advertising revenues over the past decade but these gains were
against a ``passive Dispatch.''
   Since its purchase last year by Garden State, the Dispatch has
become ``an effective competitor,'' he said. The new owners started
the Sunday News and the Dispatch now has a morning edition to
compete directly with the Record for street sales.
   The applicants have ``met their burden of demonstrating that the
Record's losses show no substantial prospect of being reversed and
that the Record is in probable danger of financial failure in the
near immediate term,'' Boudin said.
   The Record, whose majority owner is the Carlsbad Publishing Co,
had an average daily circulation last year of 40,164, according to
Boudin's report. The Dispatch's circulation last year was 47,549.
   The Record lost $171,000 last year and $516,000 in 1987, the
report said.
   The Dispatch continues to dominate the York newspaper advertising
market with about $10.8 million in ad revenues compared to $8.8
million for the Record.

<HEAD>Namibians Return from Angola in U.N. Repatriation Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 300 people crossed into Namibia
from Angola Friday to start a U.N. repatriation program to return
thousands of Namibian refugees to their homeland.
   The main program to return about 41,000 Namibians from Angola,
Zambia and Botswana is to begin Monday morning with United Nations
charter flights carrying the refugees, a U.N. official said Friday.
   A spokesman for the South African-appointed administrator of
Namibia said the group of 300 walked across the border before the
U.N. plan was in effect, and they were fed by local tribal
authorities.
   Spokesman Eberhard Hoffman said their status would be checked
before police turned them over to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
   Nicolas Bwakira of Nigeria, who is in charge of the U.N.
operation, said 11 charter flights will deliver 1,374 refugees to
three sites in Namibia on Monday.
   The refugee airlift is part of the U.N. independence plan for
Namibia, also known as South-West Africa, that went into effect
April 1. South Africa, which has ruled Namibia for 74 years, is
responsible for implementing most of the plan under U.N. supervision.
   Bwakira said between 1,000 and 1,400 refugees will be returning
daily on flights that will continue into late July.
   He said U.N. representatives have registered 41,000 refugees but
Namibians who return on their own will not be turned back.
   Refugees returning Monday will be flown to camps at the northern
towns of Ondangwa and Grootfontein and the territorial capital
Windhoek.
   Bwakira said refugees are expected to leave the camps within
seven days and rejoin relatives.
   Thousands of Namibians fled to escape the 23-year-old war between
South African-led security forces and guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization.
   The repatriation program had been scheduled to start in May but
it was delayed by fighting between security units and SWAPO forces.
   Pre-independence elections are scheduled for November, and SWAPO
is favored to win the most votes.

   President Augusto Pinochet said Friday his
military regime may grant amnesty to human rights violators before
handing power to an elected civilian government in March.
   Police said gunmen in a stolen car shot and killed Roberto
Fuentes Morrison, a retired security agent accused of being among
the most notorious violators.
   ``This situation must be resolved now, whatever the protests by
some people,'' Pinochet said in Iquique, a port city 1,150 miles
north of Santiago. His comments were carried by local radio stations.
   ``If we want to stop all this fighting, if we want to prevent
things from getting ugly again, we have to put an end to all these
things,'' said the 73-year-old president and army commander, who
seized power in a coup 16 years ago.
   He said the matter must be settled before March 11, 1990, when he
steps down in favor of a civilian president to be elected in
December.
   Pinochet said he was not worried about himself, ``but I do worry
about my people. For me, my people come first.''
   It was the second time this week the general showed concern about
possible human rights trials under the next government. Last
Tuesday, he said the military will not tolerate such trials by
special courts or the legislature.
   ``I can not accept that members of the services be taken as
targets for revenge or that special courts be organized in
Congress,'' he said.
   Speaking to reporters Friday in Iquique, Pinochet said a new
amnesty law would cover everyone, apparently meaning both human
rights violators and terrorists. ``There will be no blacks nor
whites; this is over,'' he said.
   A 1978 amnesty law covered all human rights violations and
terrorist acts from 1973 to 1978.
   That amnesty has been applied recently _ favoring, among others,
Gen. Manuel Conteras, director of the now-disbanded DINA secret
police, and Fuentes, the man killed Friday as he left his home in
Santiago.
   After the coup ousted President Salvador Allende, an avowed
Marxist, in September 1973, security agents rounded up hundreds of
leftists and many were tortured or killed. The Roman Catholic Church
and human rights groups have documented about 750 cases of
dissidents who disappeared after arrest.
   The opposition, widely expected to win the December election,
says it does not seek revenge but intends ``to find the truth''
about human rights abuses and bring those responsible to trial.
   Police sources said Fuentes was hit by 13 bullets when four or
five attackers who fired automatic weapons from the stolen car as he
left his home. The attackers fled.
   Fuentes, in his mid-50s, was a leading member of the Joint
Command, a secret police unit accused of serious human rights
violations after the coup.

<TEXT>
   A 78-year-old fraternity house was bulldozed
Friday to make way for a student center at Lafayette College hours
before alumni and preservationists planned to ask a court to block
the demolition.
   The 6:30 a.m. bulldozing came after groups had tried for months
to convince the private liberal arts and engineering college that
the three-story, double-gable stone house had historical
significance and should be saved.
   ``It's like taking a sledgehammer to an antique,'' said Antonia
Mitman, founder of Historical Easton Inc., a preservation group.
``It was an irreplaceable stone building.''
   Bernard Carman, a college spokesman, said the college announced
plans to tear down the building last November. The college got a
permit earlier this week that allowed the demolition between June 8
and 15.
   ``Obviously there is nostalgia, but the building is simply
inappropriate for the plans we had,'' said Charles Hugle, chairman
of Lafayette's board of trustees. He promised the $16 million
student center will be a beautiful building.
   Preservationists and fraternity alumni planned to seek a
temporary restraining order in Northhampton County court when it
opened at 9 a.m. Friday, Mrs. Mitman said.
   College officials had allowed them in Thursday to photograph the
house, saying it would be demolished either Friday or Monday, but
Mrs. Mitman said opponents had no warning the bulldozers would
arrive at 6:30 a.m.
   ``I'm not going to claim it was a building of national
significance, but that's not the issue,'' said Brent Glass,
executive director of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum
Commission and a Lafayette graduate. ``The building is more of an
example of a critical pressing issue because some of our best
architecture happens to be located on college campuses.''
   The Delta Upsilon house stood on land the fraternity had leased
on the quadrangle of the 2,000-student college. The chapter
disbanded in 1988 for at least four years, acknowledging a pattern
of inappropriate behavior, said Jeffrey P. Brown, a member of the
fraternity board.

<HEAD>Suriname Legislators and Rebels Sign Peace Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislators and rebel leaders have
signed a tentative peace pact establishing conditions to end three
years of guerrilla warfare, it was reported Friday.
   Leaders of the two sides said the accord would take effect when
President Ramsewak Shankar signs it. The president's office had no
immediate comment.
   Negotiators said agreement was reached Thursday after two days of
talks in neighboring French Guiana between delegations from the
National Assembly and the Jungle Commando, the main rebel group.
   They said among the conditions for a permanent trace are the
abolishment of a state of emergency in effect since Dec. 1, 1986, in
eastern and southern Suriname, where the guerrilla war is
concentrated, and measures guaranteeing administrative
representation to the region's Bush Negroes.
   Most rebels are Bush Negroes, an ethnic minority of about 50,000
people in this former Dutch colony with a population of 400,000 on
the northeastern shoulder of South America.
   Rebels led by former army sergeant Ronnie Brunswijk have been
fighting to overthrow Suriname's military-backed government since
1986. They initially demanded the removal of former junta leader and
army commander Desi Bouterse but continued the insurgency after
Bouterse stepped down to allow elections in November 1987.
   Bouterse retained his army command after the election and is
regarded as a behind-the-scenes power broker.
   The National Assembly took the initiative for negotiations with
the Jungle Commando after several attempts by the government failed.
   National Assembly Chairman Jaggernath Lachmon told reporters in
Paramaribo that during the talks Brunswijk welcomed an amnesty
granted to the rebels by the assembly a week ago.
   Last week government troops attacked about 40 rebels who seized a
hydroelectric plant 125 miles south of the capital and threatened to
blow it up. Four soldiers and several rebels were wounded before the
guerrillas withdrew.
   Lachmon reported Brunswijk said he had not ordered the takeover
of the plant and he told the rebels to withdraw to improve the
chances for successful peace negotiations.

<HEAD>Iranian Dissident Assassinated in Dubai Hotel, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dissident Iranian clergyman who fled Tehran in
1980 was assassinated last weekend in the United Arab Emirates,
Kuwait's English-language newspaper Arab Times reported Friday.
   The newspaper identified the victim only Ayatollah Bayahmadi, 52,
and said he was shot several times on Sunday in his room at the
Excelsior Hotel in the port city of Dubai.
   It said it was not clear if one or more assassins were involved
but that a Colt revolver equipped with a silencer was used in the
attack, the paper said.
   Arab Times attributed the report to Dr. Manucher Ghanji, an
Iranian dissident living in Paris. Ghanji blamed the killing on
Iranian agents, saying the Tehran government had sought for several
years to kill Bayahmadi.
   Bayahmadi was a colonel in the Iranian army under the late Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He headed the counter-espionage service, the
report said.
   It added that Bayahmadi was involved in an attempt in 1979 to
overthrow the Islamic leadership to reinstate Shahpour Bakhtiar, the
last prime minister under the Shah.
   News of the plot leaked and a purge led to several executions.
Bayahmadi and others fled the country, and three were assassinated
in Turkey between 1984 and 1986, the newspaper report said.
   Managers of the 3-star hotel refused to confirm or deny the
report.
   Tens of thousands of Iranians are in Dubai, a port that deals
extensively with Iran across the Gulf waters.
   Bayahmadi lived in Paris where he recently became a French
citizen. He was in Dubai on a secret mission, Ghanji told the paper.
He would not elaborate.
   The newspaper said Bayahmadi frequented Dubai to meet contacts
and pass unspecified messages to Tehran.

   Despite last-minute legal efforts
by angry residents, fuel started flowing again Friday through a
pipeline that blasted part of a neighborhood just 13 days after a
runaway train disaster there.
   Operation of the pipeline resumed at 3:37 p.m., Calnev Pipe Line
Co. said. The company earlier received authorization from the U.S.
Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety, Calnev
spokesman Scott Heath said.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Lydick in Santa Ana rejected a
request by Muscoy neighborhood residents who sought a temporary
restraining order to prevent the pipeline from operating.
   Lydick's ruling said he lacked jurisdictional authority to halt
the flow of fuel or grant the residents' request that the pipeline
be rerouted away from the neighborhood, court clerk Debbie Beard
said.
   The request was filed by James H. Davis, a lawyer representing
residents of the devastated neighborhood. The city of San Bernardino
had exhausted its legal efforts to stop the pipeline from being
reactivated.
   The pipeline, which stretches 250 miles from Colton, Calif., into
Nevada, carries gasoline, jet and diesel fuel. It supplies Las Vegas
with 90 percent of its gasoline and provides fuel for Barstow,
Calif., George and Edwards Air Force bases in California and Nellis
Air Force Base in Nevada.
   Resumption of fuel pumping was bitterly opposed by residents of
the neighborhood 60 miles east of Los Angeles. Many residents have
refused to return home, fearing another disaster despite assurances
the area is safe.
   On May 12, an overloaded, runaway Southern Pacific freight train
barreled down from Cajon Pass at 90 mph, derailing on a sharp curve
and flattening part of the neighborhood. Four people were killed, 11
were injured and at least seven homes were damaged or destroyed.
   Officials said the 14-inch-diameter pipeline adjacent to the
track was inspected and was safe, but it ruptured May 25, engulfing
more of the neighborhood in flames. Two people died, 31 were
injured, 10 more homes were wrecked or damaged, and up to 1,000
residents were evacuated to area motels.
   Calnev later replaced and tested a 600-foot stretch of the
pipeline in the devastated neighborhood.
   In Friday's court hearing, the judge said the federal
transportation secretary, not the court, had power to keep the
pipeline shut down. But he said he felt ``a great deal of sympathy
and concern for the people that live in this area.''
   Davis argued that the pipeline should be moved from its present
location down an embankment from the tracks.
   ``Why leave a 14-inch pipeline carrying jet fuel and gasoline ...
in exactly the same place where the next derailing train will hit
it?'' the lawyer said.
   Anthony Andrukaitis, vice president of Chicago-based GATX
Terminals Corp., Calnev's parent company, said the 600-foot stretch
of new pipeline was pressure-tested Wednesday and is safe.
   Its walls are a half-inch thick, more than required, it is buried
deeper than the old section, and it is wrapped in an anti-corrosion
material and covered with concrete slurry, he said Thursday.
   Calnev didn't want to reroute the line, saying that would cause a
six- to eight-week interruption of service.
   The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating both
the derailment helped cause the pipeline explosion, but does not
expect the results of its probe for two months.
   Southern Pacific and Calnev have agreed to buy 22 homes,
including those destroyed or damaged in addition to others deemed in
an unsafe location. Most of the homes already have been razed.
   The companies also have paid food and lodging for 800 to 1,000
evacuated residents, and are offering $5,000 to the head of each
evacuated household to cover other incidental expenses.

   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping emerged Friday to
praise the soldiers who crushed protests for democracy, and sources
said police were arresting intellectuals accused of encouraging the
movement.
   Military presence was felt throughout the city. Convoys of trucks
and foot soldiers patrolled by day. More than 100 tanks and armored
personnel carriers rumbled through the center of Beijing after dark.
   The Foreign Ministry advised embassies to keep staff members
indoors at night, but it did not impose a curfew.
   Opposition receded in provincial cities, where soldiers and
police were called out to stop days of protest.
   A Chinese witness said police, in their pursuit of suspect
intellectuals, had searched one hotel room-by-room for a suspect,
who was not identified.
   ``We live now under terror,'' a student said.
   Deng, 84, quashed rumors that he was seriously ill or out of
power by making his first public appearance since May 16, when he
met with visiting Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   On the evening television news, he was shown with other hard-line
leaders, including Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun,
posing for a picture with senior military officials at Communist
Party headquarters.
   The officials stood for a minute of silence in tribute to
soldiers who died ``in putting down a counterrevolutionary
rebellion'' over the weekend, the official news agency Xinhua
reported.
   ``Facing a life-threatening situation, our troops never forgot
the people, never forgot the party, never forgot the country's
interest,'' Deng said, speaking forcefully and gesturing for
emphasis.
   Party chief Zhao Ziyang was absent, as were fellow reformists Hu
Qili and Tian Jiyun. Reports have said Zhao was stripped of power
for opposing the May 20 declaration of martial law in Beijing.
   Diplomatic and Western intelligence estimates say about 3,000
people were killed when the 27th Army entered the city last Saturday
and cleared student demonstrators from Tiananmen Square. The
government puts the figure at 300, most of them soldiers, and has
said no one was killed in the square.
   In Washington, the White house said reprisals against protest
leaders were ``repugnant.''
   ``Keep in mind that the government has murdered many, many of its
citizens,'' spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   Soldiers stood at most intersections in Beijing and stopped cars
at night to demand identification.
   Hundreds were posted on college campuses, where the protests
began in mid-April.
   Martial law authorities issued a new order banning
``counterrevolutionary'' posters and pamphlets, and non-military
security forces entered campuses to rip down anti-government posters.
   One apartment block still bore a huge sign proclaiming: ``The
students must be victorious. Long live the people,'' but most
buildings had government banners urging unity against the rebels.
   In the provinces, the only protest reported Friday was in
Shanghai, China's largest city. About 50,000 students and supporters
gathered in a square to mourn six people killed Tuesday when a train
crashed though a barricade built on the tracks.
   State television showed soldiers patrolling Chengdu, in the
southwest, and the ruins of a department store burned by protesters.
Police were shown making arrests in Wuhan and Harbin, two of the
cities where crowds burned buses and blocked roads.
   U.S. Ambassador James Lilley said 70 more Americans left Beijing
on Friday, including his wife. The embassy estimated 400 Americans
remained in the city, including 100 embassy employees, down from
about 2,500 before martial law. Most other foreigners were gone.
   There were no confirmed arrests of student leaders or dissidents,
but Chinese sources reported police taking suspects from homes and a
Western diplomat said: ``We know that they're picking people up all
over the place.''
   The government has announced arrests of dozens of people in
Beijing and other cities, all accused of attacking soldiers or
burning buses.
   A letter read on television, the writer not identified, said
China's best-known dissident, Fang Lizhi, was a traitor and should
be arrested. Fang and his wife took refuge in the U.S. Embassy this
week.
   Increased patrols indicated a new confidence by the military that
citizens would not attack. Also, the troops were clearly united
after several days in which small skirmishes were reported with
units opposed to the crackdown.
   Soldiers raised the flag over Tiananmen, site of the protests,
for the first time since retaking the 100-acre square from the
students early Sunday.
   Television showed a military band playing the national anthem as
the red flag was raised, and broadcast an aerial view of the square
with hundreds of trucks and dozens of tanks lined up.
   Some buses resumed operations Friday and were allowed to cross
the square's northern end.
   Soldiers continued clearing away charred frames of buses, tanks
and trucks burned by crowds trying to stop the army advance last
weekend. Neighborhood committees organized teams of residents to
help.
   Army trucks with loudspeakers drove through the streets
proclaiming: ``Our task is to protect social order. ... We want your
understanding.''
   In the English-language China Daily, a headline said saboteurs
should be crushed with ``iron fists.''
   A bicyclist said: ``There are plainclothes police everywhere. No
one dares to talk. I still support the slogans `Uphold democracy'
and `Oppose official corruption,' but now there is no way to express
such ideas.''
   A senior Chinese official said Friday stressed China's economic
reform that since 1978 ``broke the closed and rigid economic mode
and unfettered the productive forces'' will not change.
   ``Despite some temporary difficulties in China's reform, the
orientation of our reform and the open policy will not change,'' Li
Borong, vice-minister of labor, told the 150-nation International
Labor Organization conference in Geneva.

   A jury Friday convicted 153 anti-abortion
demonstrators of trespassing for blocking an abortion clinic in a
case tried in a theater because no courtroom was large enough.
   Later, outside the Jaeb Theater at the Tampa Performing Arts
Complex, several demonstrators said they had no regrets.
   The protesters face a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$1,000 fine when they return for sentencing before Hillsborough
County Judge James Arnold on June 16.
   Assistant Hillsborough State Attorney Hank Lavandera said the
verdict shows that those who disregard the law to make a point do so
at the risk of a penalty.
   ``The defendants' state of mind or motive for remaining on that
property is not a defense to the crime of trespass. That's the
law,'' prosecutor Ron Hanes told the six-person jury in summation.
   The defendants took part in a demonstration of 1,200 people
organized by Operation Rescue outside the Women's Health Center on
April 15. More than 180 abortion foes scaled a fence and blocked the
clinic until they were carted off on stretchers.
   Similar proceedings are scheduled elsewhere in the state over the
summer, including 90 defendants in Polk County in July and 111 in
Sarasota in August.

   President Bush and President Suharto of
Indonesia discussed the Cambodian conflict and U.S. policies in
Southeast Asia at a brief White House meeting Friday.
   Human rights were unmentioned in a White House statement about
the meeting. Bush had been urged in letters from members of Congress
and rights activists to raise the issue with Suharto and to press
for outside human rights observers to enter Indonesia.
   At the end of the half-hour visit, Suharto's party left the White
House by a rear exit, abandoning earlier arrangements for the
Indonesian president to talk to the press.
   On Cambodia, Bush ``reaffirmed the need for a comprehensive
settlement including verified withdrawal of all Vietnamese troops,
prevention of Khmer Rouge return to power and self-determination for
the Cambodian people,'' the White House said.
   He also ``reiterated the U.S. economic and military role in the
development of Southeast Asia,'' it added.
   Meanwhile, the World Bank announced a $350 million loan Friday to
Indonesia to help finance imports while the government pursues
economic reform. The announcement included an endorsement of changes
Suharto has instituted, saying there has already been ``a resurgence
of investment and economic recovery.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle visited Jakarta at the end of April,
discussed human rights issues with government officials and met
three rights activists.
   A letter to Bush from Asia Watch, a private rights monitoring
organization, praised the Quayle visit but added that the vice
president's ``gesture'' on human rights was later weakened because
Quayle ``seemed to equate President Suharto's economic
achievements'' with human rights protection.
   Another letter to Bush this week from 118 members of the House of
Representatives said ``Severe violations of human rights, including
executions, rape and beatings are a recurring problem'' in East
Timor, the former Portuguese colony annexed by Indonesia in
1975-1976.
   Since then, more than 100,000 of East Timor's former population
of 700,000 have died from military action, starvation or disease,
the congressional letter said.

   Drug agents seized an arsenal of heavy machine guns,
high explosives and automatic weapons intended for the assassination
of the Medellin drug cartel's top trafficker, federal officials said
Friday.
   Two men allegedly connected with the Cali cartel, a rival
Colombian cocaine-smuggling operation, were arrested in West Palm
Beach on Friday, said Patrick O'Brien, agent in charge of the
Customs Service in South Florida.
   The plot included the planned purchase of a small drone aircraft
to be flown over Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar Gaviria's
hideout and exploded, O'Brien said. Escobar's Medellin cartel is
responsible for up to 80 percent of U.S. cocaine imports, drug
agents say.
   ``The weapons were being purchased by the Cali cartel and shipped
to Colombia in what they considered a last-ditch effort to
assassinate Pablo Escobar,'' O'Brien said. ``They had shot down
Escobar's helicopter and they had him cornered, and they wanted to
finish him off.''
   The weapons were intercepted on Florida's Turnpike as the two
suspects were to pick them up from illegal arms dealers, O'Brien
said.
   ``This was not a sting, and we expect to charge the dealers as
well,'' he added.
   Customs and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents
confiscated five fully automatic M-60 machine guns, 100 pounds of
C-4 explosives, 25 MAC-11 machine guns, 20 AR-15 assault rifles, and
$104,000 in cash, along with a plane and a van.
   The M-60 machine guns were to be mounted on helicopters for an
attack on Escobar's hideout, Customs officials said.
   The men arrested on weapons charges were identified as David
Candiotti, 27, of Miami Beach, and Carlos Enrique Gil, 25, of Miami.
They told undercover agents their orders were coming from ``Don
Pacho,'' a leader of the Cali cartel.
   Also arrested Friday on drug trafficking charges were two leaders
of the Cali Cartel identified as Luis Santacruz Echeverri and
Guillermo Penagos, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
   The Medellin and Cali cartels have worked together in the past on
some drug shipments, drug agents say. O'Brien said he did not know
why the Cali smugglers had decided to kill Escobar.
   A six-month investigation, which originated with an undercover
penetration of a South American drug organization, also uncovered
previous shipments to Colombia, he said.
   The five flights to a clandestine strip in Cali carried automatic
weapons, plastic explosives, silencers, machine pistols,
night-vision equipment and sniper rifles, O'Brien said.
   The weapons ``were to be used by rival political factions in
Colombia for use in protection and political assassinations,'' he
said.
   In addition, the Cali cartel had a shopping list that included
grenade launchers and armor-penetrating weapons systems, Customs
officials said.
   Drug agents seized $104,000 the suspects had intended to use to
buy some of the weapons. The suspects also asked agents to launder
$10 million in drug profits at a later date.
   ``But the weapons came first, so we decided to move right away,''
O'Brien said.
   He said the investigation into the case was continuing.
   Although the agents were pleased with the bust, there were some
regrets, Miami Customs spokesman Michael Sheehan said.
   ``Legally, we were obligated to arrest the individuals and seize
the weapons,'' Sheehan said, ``but realistically many of us would
have been happy to see them used against cartel leaders.''

   The United States vetoed a Security Council
resolution Friday calling it unbalanced because it condemned
Israel's crackdown in the occupied territories but did not address
Palestinian violence.
   The vote was 14-1 with American allies Britain, France and Canada
supporting the resolution. In weeks of negotiation and argument
before the vote the United States sought first to block debate and
then to obtain amendments.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the resolution made
``sweeping condemnations of Israel's policies and practices without
any reference to any of the serious acts of violence by the other
side.''
   ``It does not condemn violence from all quarters or affirm that
all parties have a responsibility to help reduce tensions,'' he said.
   Arab League Ambassador Clovis Maksoud called the veto ``a major
disappointment. It indicates how entrenched is the U.S. bias in
favor of Israel and how cosmetic and supervicial can be U.S.
official proclamations of concern for Palestinian suffering and
rights.''
   He said the league had hoped the Bush administration was moving
toward a more even-handed position in the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   At least 513 Palestinians have been killed during the
18-month-old rebellion in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and 22
Israelis have been slain. Israel captured the territories from
Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 war.
   More than 50 speakers addressed the council in four days of
debate. Most criticized Israeli tactics, which they said violated
the rights of Palestinians.
   Israel said the denunciations of the Jewish state prove an
international conference on the Middle East would be accomplish
nothing.
   On Thursday, Ambassador Johanan Bein presented a litany of
Palestinian terrorism and guerrilla actions against Israel but did
not address Israel's harsh tactics in the West Bank and Gaza.
   The Soviet Union, France and Finland said Friday an international
conference should be held under U.N. auspices as away to begin peace
negotiations.
   Ambassador John Birch of Britain said Israel's practices in the
territories ``ill become a state that was founded after so much
suffering by its people, on humane and democratic principles.''
   The United States and the four other permanent members _ the
Soviet Union, China, Britain and France _ can kill any Security
Council resolution by voting against it. Washington routinely vetoes
measures it considers to be one-sided criticisms of Israel.
   Pickering, who previously served as ambassador to Israel, is
chairman of the Security Council for June. He said the United States
wanted amendments to make the resolution more balanced, but they
were rejected by most members.
   He said the United States deplored all violence in the occupied
lands and supported some provisions of the resolution. He said the
United States agreed that Israel should abide by the 1949 Geneva
Convention on the treatement of civilians in occupied territories.
   ``The United States is deeply disturbed by the continuing
violence in the territories and we deplore bloodshed,'' Pickering
said. ``But the problem of the occupied territories can be resolved
only through a negotiated settlement for a comprehensive peace''
based on previous U.N. resolutions.
   Friday's resolution ``strongly deplores those policies and
practices of Israel, the occupying power, which violate the human
rights of the Palestinian people, as well as vigilante attacks
against Palestinian towns and villages and desecration of the holy
Koran.''
   It demands that Israel stop deporting Palestinians and ensure the
safe and immediate return of those who have been expelled.
   Non-permanent members currently serving on the 15-nation council
are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia,
Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.

   The first Nicaraguan Contra leader willing to return
home to test the Sandinistas' commitment to democracy left exile
here Friday, saying he hopes to help end the bloody fighting that
has divided his country.
   Alfredo Cesar, the only one of seven Contra directors to make the
trip, departed Miami aboard an Eastern Airlines flight Friday
evening. He planned to arrive in Nicaragua on Sunday morning.
   Cesar said he goes home wary of the Sandinistas' sincerity in
conducting February's scheduled presidential elections, but willing
to test his former enemy.
   ``I've been in exile seven years and it's pretty hard to assess
the Sandinistas' intentions,'' Cesar told The Associated Press. ``I
do return with good will, and I hope that this is going to be the
final solution for the conflict in Nicaragua.''
   The anti-communist rebels' other six directors refused to bow to
pressure from the Bush administration and Latin American leaders to
return, and earlier this week criticized Cesar.
   ``We think it divides the opposition,'' Aristides Sanchez said.
   Cesar said the Contra leadership must agree to disagree.
   ``I told them that I respect their decision, and that I hope they
will respect my decision,'' Cesar said.
   Cesar said he and his family want to return to Nicaragua because
now it is the only place he can continue battling for freedom and
democracy.
   He and 15 other people, most associated with Nicaragua's Social
Democratic Party, are meeting in Guatemala City and will fly to
Managua on Sunday aboard a plane provided by Venezuela's President
Carlos Andres Perez.
   ``What I plan to do is mobilize the people in Nicaragua to put on
pressure to make sure the elections are going to be fair,'' he said.
   He is not expecting a smooth political campaign.
   ``That's inevitable _ we're coming out of eight years of civil
war, you can't have it perfect,'' Cesar said.
   The Sandinistas have harassed opposition politicians by
interfering with their communication and transportation, and
limiting their access to the media, he said. That alone will not
cause him to give up, however.
   ``The key issue is that we can't have widespread fraud'' in
February's vote counting, Cesar said.
   He said internal opposition groups will agree on a single
candidate to run against the Sandinistas but insists he will not be
that person.
   ``I will be devoting my time to grassroots politics, organizing
the party nationwide,'' he said. ``I don't have plans to run for
office, and I will support a single candidate from the opposition.''
   Despite his willingness to jump into the political process, he
does not favor disbanding the thousands of U.S.-supported Contra
troops in Honduran camps just over the Nicaraguan border.
   He said the United States should continue providing non-lethal
aid to the rebels, although he opposes military aid at this time.
   ``They should sit there and wait and observe what's going on in
the process,'' he said. ``If the process is not fair, and the
Nicaraguan people do not get the chance to express their will, then
the troops should decide what to do.''

   The first raven to be hatched at the Tower of
London in three centuries made its public debut Friday, said the
keeper, who proclaimed that because of the birth England was safe.
   Legend warns of the destruction of the kingdom should the ravens
ever leave the tower.
   ``Now we have the knack of breeding them here, there are no
worries for the empire,'' said Yeoman Ravenmaster John Wilmington.
``Royalty, the fortress and England are safe.''
   The raven chick was born in the shadow of the White Tower on May
1 but was kept out of sight for its own protection. It is the first
chick to be born to ravens bred in captivity in the tower.
   ``I am over the moon,'' said Wilmington as he fed his ravenous
young charge scraps of raw meat. ``It is the first time a raven has
been born at the Tower since the reign of Charles II.''
   Ravens have always lived at the Tower and, according to history,
there were so many during Charles II's reign that he decided to get
rid of them.
   It is said he was advised to keep some of the birds, and the
legend about the destruction of the empire is believed to date from
that period.

<TEXT>
   A woman who claims her two infant
daughters were abducted three years apart pleaded innocent Friday to
charges of obstructing justice and concealing the death of her first
child.
   Paula Sims of Alton appeared in Jersey County court and entered
innocent pleas to three counts of obstructing justice and one count
of concealing a homicide in the 1986 death of 13-day-old Loralei
Sims.
   Judge Claude Davis set trial for July 18 and denied Mrs. Sims'
request for a reduction of her $100,000 bond, State's Attorney
Richard Ringhausen said.
   Mrs. Sims, 29, has posted 10 percent of the bond and remains free.
   The case of Loralei Sims is three years old, but authorities said
they gathered new evidence against Mrs. Sims while investigating the
death of her second daughter, Heather, several weeks ago.
   About a week after Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert, reported
Loralei missing, authorities found the remains of an infant near the
couple's home in Brighton. No one has been charged with the death.
   On April 29, Mrs. Sims said 6-week-old Heather disappeared under
nearly identical circumstances: a masked gunman entered the family
home in Alton and abducted the baby while her husband was at work.
   Heather's body was found May 3 in Missouri across the Mississippi
River from Alton. No one has been charged in Heather's death, but
police say the Simses are suspects.

   A decorated Vietnam War veteran from
Scotland who federal officials have been trying to deport for 11
years can stay in the United States, a federal immigration judge
ruled Friday.
   ``It's sort of like coming home,'' said Frederick S. Jackson,
wiping tears away from his eyes, after Judge Billino W. D'Ambrosio
handed down the ruling. ``I feel a little better about myself.''
   The government began deportation proceedings against Jackson in
1978, citing his convictions on a string of burglary, larceny and
drug possession charges.
   Jackson, 40, has been a resident alien in the United States for
20 years. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1967 at age 18, two years
after his family emigrated to Norwich, an industrial city about 30
miles southeast of Hartford.
   He went to Vietnam in January 1968 as an infantryman with the 1st
Air Cavalry Division and was awarded two Purple Hearts and a Bronze
Star.
   D'Ambrosio ruled that Jackson's family ties, his military service
and efforts to rehabilitate himself outweigh his criminal record,
which includes 26 felony convictions since he left the Army in 1970.
   Under federal immigration laws, resident aliens who have been
convicted of at least two crimes involving ``moral turpitude'' are
subject to deportation.
   Jackson blames his crimes on post-traumatic stress disorder, a
psychological disorder found in some Vietnam veterans and victims of
violent crimes. Jackson has said flashbacks of terrifying ambushes
and firefights led him to abuse drugs and alcohol.
   ``Fred was more of a victim than anything,'' said Robert Money of
the International Institute, Jackson's legal representative during
the hearings. ``It's been neglect on the part of the VA. Nobody
recognized the fact that he had PTSD until recently.''
   Jackson sought treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder last
summer at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in
Northhampton, Mass., and said he has not used drugs or alcohol since
he began the treatment program.
   Jackson's wife, Charlene, said after the hearing that the changes
in her husband since he began psychiatric treatment are dramatic.
``The difference between three years ago and today is a 180-degree
turnaround,'' she said.
   In 1980, Jackson was convicted on armed robbery charges in
Florida. After he was released from prison in 1985, the government
renewed its efforts to force Jackson out of the country.
   Money said he has filed an application for Jackson to become a
naturalized citizen, but he said the application was put on hold
until the judge issued the deportation ruling.
   Jackson lives in public housing in Norwich with his wife,
Charlene, her 6-year-old son and their infant daughter. The family
lives on disability payments from the Army, and from Social
Security, which has declared him 100 percent disabled.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American rocket expert accused of
trying to smuggle sophisticated weapons technology to Egypt pleaded
guilty Friday, and promised to cooperate with investigators in an
international probe.
   Abdelkader Helmy, 41, of El Dorado Hills pleaded guilty to one
count of illicit export in return for having 11 other charges
dismissed. He faces up to $1 million in fines and 10 years in prison.
   As part of the plea arrangement, federal prosecutors urged that
Helmy serve nearly five years in prison. U.S. District Judge Raul
Ramirez set a presentencing hearing for Sept. 27.
   ``I put my faith in God and your judgment,'' Helmy told Ramirez.
   Helmy, who was employed as a rocket expert at Aerojet Solid
Propulsion Corp., said he participated in an international ring that
attempted to smuggle out 430 pounds of ``carbon phenolic cloth,'' a
low-radar visibility material used in missile nose cones and stealth
aircraft.
   The cloth, which is on the American government's restricted
munitions list, cannot be exported without a special license.
Aerojet was not implicated in the scheme, federal authorities said.
   Helmy, who has worked for NASA and propulsion companies in France
and West Germany, said last year that he was recruited for the
smuggling scheme by Egypt's defense minister, Lt. Gen. Abdel Halim
Abu Ghazala. In August 1988, The Washington Post reported that
transcripts of monitored telephone conversations appeared to
implicate Ghazala in the alleged scheme.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has denied that Helmy was part
of an Egyptian spy ring.
   According to federal prosecutors, Helmy received at least $1
million in payments from Egyptian sources to purchase
high-technology materials such as missile equipment.
   ``The indictment against Helmy charges serious violations of the
nation's export laws,'' said U.S. Attorney David Levi. ``As Helmy
has today admitted, he was involved in an effort to defeat those
laws and to export technology and items of military importance.''
   Helmy admitted that he and a confederate shipped the material
last June from Minnesota, where it was manufactured by the Fiberite
Corp., to the Baltimore-Washington Airport. Federal agents seized
the material moments after it was loaded aboard a C-130 transport
bound for Egypt.
   Prosecutors say the Egyptian-American smuggling ring also shipped
contraband to a residence in Washington, D.C., owned by the Egyptian
government.
   Helmy's alleged accomplice, James Huffman of Livingston, Ohio, is
scheduled to go on trial Aug. 8 before Ramirez. Huffman, an
aerospace equipment marketing agent, is free on a $250,000 bond. A
charge against Helmy's wife was dismissed.
   Two others, both Egyptian nationals, are also facing charges in
the case: Egyptian Army Col. Ahmed Hussam Al-Din Khairat and Col.
Fuad Algamal, who was in the United States on a diplomatic visa at
the time the smuggling occurred. Both men claimed diplomatic
immunity, left the United States and are believed to be in Egypt.
   Helmy and his lawyer, Marcus Topel of San Francisco, said Helmy
would cooperate with prosecutors and investigators. That cooperation
will likely include testifying against Huffman, Ramirez said.

   The Soviet government said Friday it is surprised and
disappointed at China's violent crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators, whose Goddess of Democracy statue was emulated on
campuses in Taiwan.
   Blood, money and medicine were donated to help injured Chinese,
and the French-based medical group, Doctors Without Borders, asked
China to allow it to send a team.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Soviet officials were taken aback by how Chinese communist leaders
suppressed student demonstrators who rallied peacefully for weeks in
support of broader reforms.
   ``We hadn't expected this,'' Gerasimov said in an interview in
Bonn, West Germany. He said Soviet authorities were ``extremely
dismayed'' at Beijing's actions.
   The spokesman also said Soviet officials have been unable to go
to Beijing.
   ``We can't get through, either,'' said Gerasimov, who with other
Soviet officials are preparing for next week's West German visit by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The spokesman's comments are the first official Soviet response
since the new Soviet Congress issued an extremely guarded statement
Tuesday saying events in China were ``an internal affair.''
   Troops acting on orders from Chinese hard-liners led by
conservative Premier Li Peng attacked the demonstrators last
weekend. The government says 300 people, mostly soldiers, were
killed, but Western diplomats said 3,000 may have died.
   In Taipei Friday night, a massive rally in a downtown park drew
students, residents, reporters and entertainers singing patriotic
songs and chanting slogans to denounce the military shootings in
Beijing.
   At the rally, students at the National Taiwan Academy of Arts
brought a ``Goddess of Democracy'' statue like the one built by
Chinese students in Beijing's Tiananmen Square that soldiers tore
down during the crackdown.
   Three similar statues were erected at colleges across the island.
   The Nationalists fled to Taiwan after losing a civil war to the
Communists in mainland China in 1949. Both administrations claim
they are the legitimate government of all China.
   Soon after the weekend crackdown in Beijing, Taiwan's President
Lee Teng-hui put the island's 500,000-member armed forces on alert,
saying it was in case the Communist government collapses and its
troops invade Taiwan.
   The Red Cross Association in Taiwan announced it received about
$1.15 million in donations for the Chinese victims.
   Tens of thousands of Taiwanese have donated money, newspapers,
medical supplies and blood to support fellow Chinese in Beijing but
Taiwan has not found a proper channel to deliver the donation.
   In Paris, the humanitarian group Medecins sans Frontieres
(Doctors without Borders) said Friday it is sending a planeload of
medical supplies to Hong Kong, hoping to take it into China.
   Rony Brauman, president of the organization, told a news
conference Chinese authorities had not yet responded to a request to
authorize the relief mission, which includes seven doctors and 23
tons of drugs and surgical equipment.
   A Philippine senator said Friday the turmoil in China underscores
the need to retain U.S. bases in his country despite strong domestic
opposition.
   ``This issue could be used by the Philippine government in the
forthcoming review of the bases agreement with the United States,''
Sen. John Osmena said in a statement.
   President Corazon Aquino refuses to say whether she will support
an extension after 1992 for Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval base
and the four other U.S. installations.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke wept openly during an address
Friday at a memorial service in Canberra for the Chinese students
who died in Beijing. More than 4,000 people packed the service in
the Great Hall at Canberra's new Parliament House.
   ``To crush the spirit and body of youth is to crush the very
future of China itself,'' Hawke said.
   In Havana, Cuban President Fidel Castro told visiting Chinese
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen on Friday that China must solve its
problems by itself, the Mexican government news agency Notimex said
in dispatch.
   Qian is the first top Chinese to visit Cuba in the 28 years the
two countries have had diplomatic relations.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three whites were sentenced Friday to an
effective 40 years in prison for helping South African commandos
attack African National Congress targets in Zimbabwe.
   High Court Judge Ahmed Ebrahim told Zimbabwean nationals Kevin
Woods, 36, Michael Smith, 35 and Barry Bawden, 31, they were
convicted of giving active and direct assistance to an unspecified
number of South African raiders in May 1986, but he decided against
sentencing them to death.
   He sentenced each man to 70 years' imprisonment, with 30 years to
run concurrently on charges under law and order regulations.
   The ANC is the main guerrilla organization fighting the
white-dominated government in South Africa.
   ``The courts of this country are determined to play their part in
taking terrorist attacks off the streets and keeping violence out of
our society,'' Ebrahim said.
   On May 19, 1986, South African raiders bombed offices of the ANC
in downtown Harare and raked with gunfire a suburban house used by
ANC officials before demolishing it with high explosives.
   Both buildings were empty and no one was injured in the attacks.
   Ebrahim said the three whites helped in the careful planning of
the attacks and provided equipment and transport for the attacking
force. After the attacks the commandos were picked up by a South
African military helicopter at a remote landing strip southwest of
Harare, he said.
   Woods, a former senior officer in the Zimbabwe intellegence
service, and Smith are already under sentence of death for
involvement in a car bombing last year outside an ANC house in the
second biggest city of Bulawayo.
   A man hired to drive a booby-trapped car died in that blast.
   Ebrahim rejected a defense application to appeal against the jail
terms described by advocate John Sayce as ``manifestly excessive.''
   He said the whites were convicted on capital charges relating to
national security and ``if anything, we are erring on the side of
leniency.''

<TEXT>
   Dental records confirmed Friday that
three bodies found bound, gagged and weighted in Tampa Bay were
those of an Ohio farm wife and her teen-age daughters reported
missing during a vacation.
   The dead were identified as Joan M. Rogers, 36, of Willshire and
her daughters, Michelle, 17, and Christie, 14, said St. Petersburg
police spokesman Wendall Creager.
   ``We have no suspects, no leads,'' Creager said.
   Investigators appealed to the public to help find the owner of a
25-foot blue and white boat spotted in the parking lot of the Tampa
motel where the Rogerses were staying.
   Preliminary autopsy results show the women drowned, Stan Owens,
sheriff in Van Wert County, Ohio, said he learned from Florida
authorities.
   Police speculated that the women may have been thrown into the
water alive because the bodies showed no sign of trauma, such as
shooting or stab wounds.
   ``In all probability it's going to be drowning,'' Creager said.
``We do have a preliminary (finding), but it's not conclusive.'' The
information isn't expected to be released until early next week.
   The bodies, nude from the waist down, were found Sunday floating
in the bay, each tied to a cinder block. Police estimated they died
late June 1 or early June 2.
   Creager asked for information about a boat seen sitting on a
float-off trailer behind a car June 1 in the parking lot of where
the women were staying.
   ``It's a long shot. We don't know if it's related. But we intend
to pursue it. We want to talk to the owner of that boat,'' Creager
said. ``We haven't ruled anything out.''
   The Rogers had come from the Walt Disney World area and were en
route home when they stopped in Tampa on June 1, Creager said. They
checked into a motel but didn't stay overnight in their room.
   Mrs. Rogers' husband, Hal Rogers, filed a missing persons report
after his family failed to return from the vacation on Sunday as
expected.
   The Rev. Gary Luderman, the family's minister in Willshire, said
Rogers learned from Florida authorities Thursday that the family car
was found abandoned on a causeway in Tampa.
   A handwritten note was found inside with directions to a boat
ramp about a mile from the motel where the women were registered.

<TEXT>
   About 125 rebels attacked twin
hydroelectric plants near Jinotega with mortar fire and grenades,
blacking out much of northern Nicaragua for an entire night, army
officials said Friday.
   Sandinista army sources in Jinotega, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the attacks on the CentroAmerica and Canal plants
occurred simultaneously at 9:30 p.m. Thursday about 100 miles north
of the capital.
   Early reports had mentioned only CentroAmerica as a target.
   ``There were no deaths on either side,'' Col. Manuel Salvatierra
told The Associated Press on Friday. Salvatierra is military chief
of the 6th Region, which oversees Jinotega and Matagalpa provinces.
   Sources said the rebels, known as the Contras, also blew up
electrical poles along the road between Jinotega and CentroAmerica.
The 50-megawatt plant is a major component of the nation's power
grid.
   The government's Voice of Nicaragua radio station said Jinotega
city, the provincial capital, and a large part of northern Nicaragua
were left without electricity all night. Power was restored in some
areas early Friday, it said.
   Sandinsta soldier Ladislao Vargas, among those trying to repel
the rebel attack at the Canal plant, said one soldier was slightly
injured.
   ``They couldn't get us out of the ditch,'' said Vargas, motioning
to ditches surrounded by stones.
   ``We communicated by radio, but reinforcements arrived after the
Contras had begun retreating.''
   Vargas said the fighting between about 25 rebels and six soldiers
at the Canal plant lasted about 30 minutes.
   During the attack, the minister of the Nicaraguan Energy
Institute, Emilio Rapacciolli, ordered plant operators to turn off
turbines to minimize damage.
   Energy officials reported minor damage to the Canal plant
building, but said the turbines were not affected.
   Rapacciolli said serious damage to Canal could have caused
massive flooding in the neighboring Cacio Valley, home to about 400
people.
   The plant controls all water flow into CentroAmerica's turbines.
   Salvatierra said the attack on CentroAmerica by about 100 Contras
came at two points and lasted up to 45 minutes.
   Voice of Nicaragua called the attack a violation of cease-fire
accords accepted last year by the U.S.-backed rebels and government.
   That agreement included a temporary cease-fire and called for
negotiations to end the 9-year-old civil war. Talks on a permanent
truce collapsed last September. The government said it would
continue to observe a cease-fire, but both sides have made
occasional attacks.
   President Daniel Ortega extended the cease-fire on May 31 for 30
days.
   He said 559 civilians and soldiers were killed or wounded in 881
attacks between Jan. 1 to May 29. He said the army killed 355 rebels
and wounded 283 during that period.

   Assassins firing submachine guns
from a moving car killed the new government's most senior Cabinet
minister and two bodyguards on Friday as they drove from the
minister's home, officials said.
   The armed forces, President Alfredo Cristiani and leaders of his
governing right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance blamed leftist
guerrillas who have pledged to make the country ungovernable. Rebels
did not immediately claim responsibility.
   Jose Antonio Rodriguez Porth, 73, minister of the presidency and
President Alfredo Cristiani's closest adviser, died shortly after
arriving at Zaldivar Hospital, a nurse said on condition of
anonymity.
   He was the first Cabinet member killed in the nine-year guerrilla
war. Police sources said the bodyguards, one of whom was driving the
bulletproof car, died at the scene. Machine-gun fire can penetrate
so-called bulletproof cars.
   Cristiani told a news conference his government will not allow
more ``provocations that push our country farther down into the
whirlpool of violence.'' He called Rodriguez ``one of the most
illustrious men of our country.''
   Cristiani said his government is convinced leftist rebels are
``trying to provoke a reaction from us, but we are not going to
react outside of the law.''
   A White House statement issued in Washington said President Bush
``strongly condemns the vicious murder'' of Rodriguez. ``We hope the
Salvadoran police forces will find those responsible for this
despicable act. ... The president again calls on extremist groups to
put an end to the violence in El Salvador.'' Vice President Dan
Quayle will deliver Bush's condolences to the Rodriguez family and
to Christiani while visiting Central America next week, it added.
   Party President Armando Calderon Sol said the minister was
ambushed just after leaving his home in a western neighborhood of
San Salvador.
   Witnesses, however, said four men in a red vehicle fired in front
of Rodriguez' house before the car was started. They said they heard
five or six shots.
   It was the first attack on an official of the party, known as
Arena, since Cristiani took office June 1 and the fourth attack on
party officials this year.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or
FMLN, last week offered to halt attacks if the new government
eliminated death squads. The government denies any involvement with
death squads and spurned the proposal.
   Arena was founded in 1981 by cashiered army Maj. Roberto
d'Aubuisson, an Arena legislator who has been linked to the squads
that killed thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. He
denies the accusations.
   Col. Sigifrido Ochoa, another Arena leader, called for action.
   ``We are confronting brazen terrorism, commanders and
communists,'' he said. ``We either let ourselves be killed like
cowardly rats, or we organize to defend the country.''
   Calderon Sol told reporters: ``A man who defended law and justice
has fallen.''
   Gerardo Le Chevallier, leader of the Christian Democratic Party,
said the polarization that the party had expected when Arena came to
power had begun.
   The transfer of power from Christian Democratic President Jose
Napoleon Duarte to Cristiani was the first in Salvadoran history by
one democratically elected leader to another.
   Le Chevallier said the attack was the result of ``the
declarations of Cristiani that if the FMLN does not accept its peace
proposal there could be a military response.''
   Guillermo Ungo, a Social Democrat and political ally of the rebel
Front, called it ``an assassination in cold blood ... that does not
contribute in any way to peaceful coexistence and dialogue.''
   Rodriguez, a founding member of Arena, was a vice minister in the
1940s, a member of the civilian-military junta in 1961 and foreign
minister in 1978.
   His assassination came on the third day of a new guerrilla
campaign.
   On Thursday, rebels bombed a gasoline station in the capital and
attacked troops in central and eastern El Salvador.
   The day before, they attacked nine military posts and the army
said 21 rebels and three soldiers died.
   The intensified fighting follows the guerrillas' rejection
Saturday of Cristiani's proposal for dialogue. An estimated 70,000
people, mostly civilians, have been killed in the war.

   A judge reduced a former British Olympian's
seven-year prison sentence for steroid smuggling to the 10 months he
has served, but the man remained in custody Friday awaiting a
deportation hearing.
   The order signed Thursday by U.S. District Judge J. Lawrence
Irving made David Jenkins, 36, eligible for immediate release from
the Federal Prison Camp in Boron, said Warden Larry F. Taylor.
   The federal Immigration and Naturalization Service, however,
arranged to have Jenkins sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center
in Los Angeles on Saturday for a deportation hearing, Taylor said.
   Jenkins' attorney, Robert Grimes, had asked Irving to block the
deportation proceedings as well as reduce Jenkins' sentence. But the
judge did not address the immigration issue.
   Jenkins, who anchored Great Britain's silver medal-winning
400-meter relay team in the 1972 Olympics, had lived with his wife
in San Diego County before his imprisonment.
   A call to Grimes' office seeking comment was not immediately
returned.
   Jenkins, who also faces five years probation and a $75,000 fine,
pleaded guilty in November 1987 to involvement in a
multimillion-dollar steroid ring that brought the muscle-building
drug into the United States from Mexico.
   Prosecutors said members of the ring claimed it was responsible
for up to 70 percent of an estimated $100 million U.S. black market
in steroids. Jenkins' plea included an admission that he was key to
the ring.
   He pleaded guilty to one count each of conspiracy to defraud the
United States, holding counterfeit steroids for sale, introducing
misbranded steroids into interstate commerce and receiving anabolic
steroids subject to seizure.
   Steroids, which are derived from the male sex hormone, can cause
side effects such as liver disorders and heart disease. They are
sold only by prescription in the United States.

<HEAD>Mubarak's Party Wins Full Control in New Advisory Council</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak's governing National
Democratic Party won a majority in a new governmental advisory body,
final returns indicated Friday. The opposition charged fraud.
   Interior Minister Zaki Badr said on national TV that 162 seats
were filled in voting that ended Thursday and runoff elections will
be held next week for 10 remaining seats.
   Under the constitution, Mubarak will appoint an additional 86
members from minority groups and intellectuals for the Shura
Council, a consultative body without binding authority.
   Badr gave no breakdown of the voting, but a senior official at
the Islamic Alliance, the main election rival, said all 162 seats
went to Mubarak's party, ``thanks to government ballot-rigging.''
   The official spoke on condition of anonymity. However,
Abdel-Hamid Barakat, deputy secretary-general of the Socialist Labor
Party, complained that opposition election observers were barred at
polling stations and some were beaten and arrested.
   The Islamic Alliance groups the outlawed Moslem Brotherhood with
the Liberals and Socialists. The Brotherhood has been allowed to
take part in Egyptian politics in recent years under the name of
legal parties. It wants to replace Egypt's largely secular penal and
legal codes with Islam-based laws.
   Badr put the turnout at 10.1 million of the 14.5 million eligible
voters, but some obervers put it as less than 50 percent.
   Badr, who is in charge of police, indirectly alluded to
allegations that police arrested 1,000 opposition campaign workers
and supporters. He said that ``groups who had violated election laws
had been detained.''
   Two opposition parties boycotted the elections on the ground the
council has no significant weight.
   President Bush and Mubarak meanwhile discussed regional and world
issues over the telephone Friday, the state-run Middle East News
Agency reported.
   It said the two discussed in particular efforts to resume the
Mideast peace process and that Bush expressed appreciation of
Egypt's role in the search for peace. MENA said Bush initiated the
call but gave no details.

<HEAD>Charges Dismissed Against First Parent Blamed For Son's Gang Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charges were dropped Friday against a mother
who was the first to be charged under a new state law that holds
parents responsible for their children's gang activity, officials
said.
   Gloria Williams, 37, a South Central Los Angeles resident, was
charged May 1 with failure to exercise reasonable care, supervision
or protection of minor children.
   Her 14-year-old son, an alleged gang member, is accused in the
group rape of a 12-year-old girl who was abducted from Ms. Williams'
back yard.
   Further investigation showed that Ms. Williams took ``skilled
parenting'' classes at a nearby youth center and received a
certificate after she completed 30 hours of course work.
   ``While we will not hesitate to prosecute parents who demonstrate
a lack of interest in correcting their children's behavior, this law
was not designed to prosecute parents who are making an effort to
control their children,'' said City Attorney James Hahn.
   ``The new evidence we discovered in this case indicates that Ms.
Williams was making that effort,'' Hahn said in a news release.
   Ms. Williams, who works as an assembly line supervisor at an
electronics plant, told the Los Angeles Times in a published
interview: ``How could the police know about all the things I have
done to try to help my son?''
   She was arrested at home on April 29 after a search of her modest
home showed snapshots of her son in gang regalia and one the home's
bedroom walls filled with graffiti.
   Ms. Williams, also the mother of a 20-year-old daughter and an
8-year-old boy, maintained that her teen-age son ``is a good boy and
we just want him home.'' She refused to talk about the charges
leveled against her son for fear of incriminating him.
   ``We knew they didn't have a case,'' Ms. Williams' attorney Daye
Shinn said. ``I think that they didn't do their investigation. They
just panicked and made a big story out of this.''
   The charges were under a provision of the 1988 Street Terrorism
Enforcement and Prevention Act passed by the Legislature to combat
gang-related crimes. If she was convicted, she could have faced a
year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500.

<HEAD>Bush Said Planning to Propose Big Cut in Sulfur Dioxide Emissions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is ready to propose legislation
requiring a 10-million ton reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by
the end of the century to combat acid rain, sources say.
   The proposal is expected to be part of a far-reaching rewrite of
the 1970 Clean Air Act that Bush will unveil Monday. He was spending
the weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md., putting
finishing touches on the package.
   Bush's expected proposal for cutting sulfur dioxide _ emitted
mainly by coal-fired power plants and identified as a main
ingredient in forming acid rain _ is not quite as tough as the
12-million ton reduction advocated by environmentalists.
   But it was far stronger than utilities and other coal-burning
industries have advocated _ and represents a dramatic turnabout from
the Reagan adminstration's resistence to any new standards for
controlling acid rain.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush had made
``preliminary decisions'' on the clean-air package, but would make
up his mind on some of the thornier issues this weekend while at
Camp David.
   ``He is taking with him decision memos and options on all the
major questions that are still outstanding, and we would expect
decisions over the weekend,'' Fitzwater said.
   Among the decisions still to be resolved, presumably, are whether
Bush's package will set new standards for automobile tailpipe
exhausts.
   However, administration officials, perhaps signalling a decision
against tighter tailpipe emission standards, have stressed in recent
days that the Bush package would put heavy emphasis on alternative
auto fuels _ like alcohol blends _ that contain fewer contaminants.
   After unveiling the clean-air package on Monday, Bush was to
showcase it on a two-day trip west, with clean-air speeches planned
for Wyoming and Nebraska.
   Cutting sulfur dioxide in the air by 10 million tons by the year
2000, as Bush was expected to recommend, would reduce the
contaminent to roughly half current levels.
   Acid rain is formed when sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides
combine with water in the atmosphere to form acid which then returns
to Earth in the rainfall, snow and dust.
   Midwestern utilties that burn high-sulfur coal without
technological controls are generally agreed to be the chief sources
of much of the acid rain downwind of them, damaging forests and
lakes in Canada and the Northeast.
   Bush's acid-rain reduction program is expected to be in two
phases with half of the 10 million-ton cut in sulfur dioxide
emissions to be achieved by 1995 and the remainder by the year 2000,
according to sources.
   It was unclear Friday how the reduction requirements would be
distributed among electric power plants nationwide.
   According to sources, the president was provided options that
ranged from hitting the 20 dirtiest plants hardest during the first
phase, forcing them to come up with most of the early reductions, to
spreading the burden across 107 plants across the country nationwide
with each plant requiring smaller cuts in emissions.
   The president also is expected to include in his proposal a
system by which a utility that exceeds the reduction requirements
may sell ``credits'' to another utility that has not met the lower
emissions levels to help bring that utility into compliance.
   Bush also is considering a reduction in nitrous oxide emissions,
another component of acid rain which primarily comes from electric
utility plants and automobiles. Nitric acid is suspected of causing
some kinds of forest damage.
   Options prepared for Bush by the Cabinet-level Domestic Policy
Council suggest that nitrous oxides be cut by 2 million to 4 million
tons. The list of options was obtained by The Associated Press.
   The utility industry has complained that if the 20 worst
polluting plant are required to make drastic cuts it would mean
sharply higher electric rates for the customers of those utilities.
   An Ohio utility company, American Electric Power, said Friday if
the 20-plant option is adopted, it would be forced to raise
residential electric rates to to its customers from 15 to 25 percent.
   Six of the 20 dirtiest power plants, all of which burn high
sulfur coal, are in Ohio.
   ``The cost of such emission reductions will grind the economies
of the Midwestern states. Our heavy industries which rely upon low
energy costs ... would be devastated,'' said A. Joseph Dowd, senior
vice president of American Electric Power.

   Gone from Tiananmen Square are the pro-democracy
banners and the tents of China's freedom movement, replaced by
tanks, armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers.
   The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first
glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the
capital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement
for political change.
   Troops moved back their barricades, making it possible for city
residents to walk to the edge of the square, which for seven weeks
stood at the heart of the movement. Buses and bicyclists today were
allowed to pass by Changan Avenue, which borders the north edge of
the square.
   The spot once occupied by the Goddess of Democracy, a
33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty, was taken by a
tread-wheeled armored personnel carrier. When students built the
statue last week, for a few days it became a symbol of the movement
for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption. On Sunday
morning, a tank crushed it.

   President Bush refuses to fix blame for the
massacre in Beijing but says it would be ``extraordinarily
difficult'' to have ties with anyone responsible for the bloodshed.
   Bush, in the first prime-time news conference of his presidency,
said Thursday night that the United States won't have normal
relations with China until the government there recognizes demands
for democracy.
   Despite a military crackdown that killed hundreds if not
thousands of people in Beijing, Bush emphasized Thursday night that
he wants to ``preserve the relationship'' with China.
   But for that relationship to be normal, he said, ``it will take a
recognition of the rights of individuals and respect for the rights
of those who disagree.''

   Some Chinese army officers favor the goals of the
democracy movement, but the military as a whole is still largely
sympathetic to hard-liners who ordered the recent crackdown,
academic experts on China say.
   Any conflicts within the military over the handling of student
unrest are unlikely to flare into major confrontations among army
units, they say.
   ``The army has always opted for unity. The instinct of most
Chinese soldiers is to unite behind bad policy instead of breaking
up,'' said Harvey Jencks, a research associate at the University of
California at Berkeley and an expert on the Chinese military.
   Economic reforms have increased inflation in China, eroding the
value of military wages and making the army sympathetic to hard-line
policies, many experts said.

   Small amounts of alcohol may help older people,
but a government workshop says alcohol abuse can worsen diseases of
the aging, particularly heart disease.
   More research is needed into the relationship between alcohol and
cardiovascular disease, especially as the population ages, the
workshop said in a report. Heart disease is the most common killer
of Americans 65 and older.
   The recommendations from the Surgeon General's Workshop on Health
Promotion and Aging were published Thursday by the federal Centers
for Disease Control.
   It noted that between 1950 and 1980 the number of Americans 65
and older increased from 12.5 million to 25.5 million, with the
largest increase in the 85-and-older group. The percentage of
Americans older than 65 is 12 percent now and will be 21.1 percent
by the year 2030, the report said.

   Partisan disputes over Jim Wright's ethics and
Republican opposition to a key reform threaten President Bush's plan

   The debate is taking on a more political tinge as the full House

Democratic leader Tony Coelho. Both Wright and Coelho are leaving
the House under fire on ethics issues.
   Democrats, meanwhile, began making an issue of GOP House members'
opposition to the reforms that Bush has requested. The Republicans
are trying to weaken a key reform that Bush says is needed to
prevent a similar debacle in the future _ requiring S&amp;L owners to
put up more of their own money when making speculative loans.

   Aerial infrared surveillance showed hazardous

   The affidavit also accused Rocky Flats operators of illegally
discharging pollutants into a creek on plant property and of

   U.S. Magistrate Hilbert Schauer unsealed the affidavit after a

to issue a search warrant for the raid Tuesday on the plant 16 miles
northwest of Denver.
   The 116-page affidavit catalogs the allegations made by FBI agent

violations of hazardous waste laws will probe activities at the

little attention is paid to remedial education needs of high school
dropouts in the system set up under the Job Training Partnership Act.
   In addition, the congressional agency said the system's programs
are paying too much for on-the-job training for low-skill positions,
essentially paying wage subsidies to employers who are shirking
their responsibilities to provide worthwhile training.
   ``JTPA has not targeted those with the greatest need for

   Mice given an AIDS virus gene developed an

leading researcher Dr. Robert Gallo said Friday.
   Gallo, one of the discoverers of the AIDS virus, also said an
experimental AIDS drug called CD4 is the closest thing to a ``magic
bullet'' to eradicate AIDS.
   ``If CD4 doesn't work in the early phases, don't despair,'' he
said. The drug blocks the mechanism by which the AIDS virus attaches
to certain white blood cells and infects them.
   This mechanism is so critical to AIDS virus growth in the body
that some version of CD4 ought to be able to interfere with it, he
said.

   The Philippines' last
environmental frontier is here in Palawan province and
conservationists are struggling to save it _ from people who sell
its wildlife, chop down its forests, overfish its waters and swarm
in from elsewhere to burn off its land for farming.
   At Puerto Princesa's bustling market white-breasted sea eagles
are sold for less than $100 and talking mynah birds for $30.
   Immigration from other islands, which has grown by an average of
5 percent since the start of the decade, has reduced the percentage
of Palawan's original settlers _ including at least seven native
tribes _ to less than half of the population, now estimated at
500,000.
   The influx has created serious ecological problems, among them
the slash-and-burn farming methods of poor settlers and the vigorous
collection of wildlife for sale. Wealthy logging concessionaires
have been accused of plundering the province's timber resources.
   Mountains run the length of the province's main island, on which
are found 232 _ or one-fifth _ of the country's wildlife species,
environmentalists say. Many of the species are yet to be classified.
   Palawan, the Philippines' largest province, about 150 miles
southwest of Manila, is also home to about 1,500 species of plants
whose medicinal and food properties have not been fully examined.
   More than 1,700 islands offer 2,000 miles of coastline. Waters
teem with fish. The provincial environment office says nearly 50
million metric tons of fish were caught in 1987 alone.
   Human fossils 22,000 years old have been found in the province's
Tabon Cave.
   The Haribon Foundation, a conservationist group, has gathered a
million signatures since last year to pressure the government into
declaring Palawan a protected area.
   In a recent letter to President Corazon Aquino, Haribon's
President Maximo Kalaw urged a ban on commercial logging and
collection of wildlife in Palawan. Haribon also urged the
establishment of communal forest areas for island residents.
   Mrs. Aquino referred the petition to the Department of
Environment and Natural Resources.
   ``The issue in Palawan is not only about conservation but about
social equity and sustainable development for generations of
Filipinos to come,'' Kalaw said.
   Nearly 70 percent of Palawan's land area of 3.7 million acres is
forested. Haribon blames loggers, whose concessions cover one-fifth
of forest lands, for denuding an estimated 46,930 acres of forests
yearly.
   The destruction of natural forests has resulted in soil erosion,
siltation and flooding in the southern part of the province,
district foresters said.
   Officials say they lack resources to protect the forests. Mariano
Villanueva, provincial environment and natural resources officer,
says he has only 179 guards, each responsible for 9,880 acres of
forest.
   The illegal use of cyanide and dynamite by fishermen threatens
fish stocks and the coral offshore. Villanueva says his agents
cannot arrest fishermen suspected of using cyanide because they have
no equipment to detect the poison.
   Aside from cyanide and dynamite, local fishermen use a technique
called ``muro-ami'' fishing, in which they drive poles into the
coral to divert fish into their nets.
   Brig. Gen. Napoleon Angeles, the regional military commander, has
seized boats and other marine equipment to discourage illegal
fishing.
   But he opposes a logging ban for fear it would result in higher
unemployment and possibly fuel the Philippines' years-long communist
insurgency, which has just recently made its way to Palawan.
   ``I am for a sustainable use of natural resources so people may
eke out some kind of livelihood program for themselves,'' said
Angeles, a member of the provincial development council.
   A British consulting firm, Hunting Technical Services, and local
agencies have developed an environmental plan for the Palawan
Integrated Area Development Project.
   The plan recommends a 20 percent reduction in the area authorized
for logging each year to prolong the cutting cycle and protect
against erosion.
   Currently, timber companies may operate on about 12,350 acres a
year. The plan calls for stricter monitoring of these companies.
   Officials have also stepped up the campaign against illegal
logging.
   Although Palawan was declared a game refuge and bird sanctuary in
1967, trading of wildlife continues. Officials recently raided the
public market and retrieved an eagle, green parrots, porcupines and
mynah birds.
   They arrived too late to save a leopard cat _ it had died in a
cage _ and a rare bearcat, which they found hanging from a nail.

<HEAD>Funny Comedy Premieres in Summer!?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS' new ``Doctor, Doctor'' might cause some
heart attacks, heart attacks among unsuspecting viewers who will be
shocked by the arrival of a funny, new comedy in the midst of summer
reruns.
   The show, which is not on CBS' fall schedule, gets a six-episode
summer run beginning tonight.
   Matt Frewer, who played ``Max Headroom,'' is well-cast as the
irreverent, young M.D., Michael Stratford, who signed on to be
Marcus Welby, but instead finds himself mired in the bureaucratic
machinations of running a clinic in partnership with other doctors
who spend most of their time considering computerized billing
procedures, malpractice insurance rates, equipment purchases, and
new uniforms for the nurses (the cardiologist thinks stark white
causes anxiety in the patients).
   In fact, Stratford's patients are in a near-riot stage in the
waiting room. Stratford tries to quiet them. ``I know you're angry,
because you've been waiting so long _ but, hey, that's why you're
called `patients.'''
   Frewer, his angular frame topped with tufts of blond, thinning
hair, lumbers cheerfully through the show, ad-libbing here, doing a
bit of slapstick there. He's a smart comic actor, and this is
intelligent material _ no wonder, since it was written by
producer-creator Norman Steinberg, who co-wrote ``My Favorite Year.''
   The rest of the cast is likewise talented, and their characters
promisingly wacky. Abraham Butterfield (Julius Carry III), the only
black member of the partnership and seemingly its only sane one,
turns into a suave Don Juan whenever he talks to his wife on the
phone. Cardiologist Grant Linowitz (Beau Gravitte) is a preening
hunk enamored of all the latest equipment. When snide associate
Dierdre Bennett (Maureen Mueller) explains her hostility toward
Grant by facetiously informing him, ``I'm insanely jealous of any
man who's prettier than I am,'' he finds this perfectly plausible.
   Future episodes will also feature Inga Swenson as Michael's
protective mother, Dakin Matthews as his gruff surgeon father who
can't accept his other son (Tony Carriero), because he is gay.
   In the first episode, on the advice of his lawyer-slash-agent
(Holly Fulger), Stratford appears on a lame, local talk show, ``Wake
Up, Providence,'' to promote his book, ``Panacea,'' a novel about
the search for a cure for cancer. When the producer (Jane Brucker)
asks if he's ever been on TV before, he claims to have played Klaus
Barbie in ``War and Remembrance.''
   The show's book critic, a sniveling dilettante named Hugh Persons
(Brian George), obviously hasn't read Stratford's tome, though by
glancing at the dust cover he has determined that it is ``taut.''
``Once you pick it up, you can't put it down,'' he insists, as he
drops the book on the desk.
   The producer asks Stratford to become the show's resident medical
expert _ which he will be in future episodes _ but he is reluctant,
complaining that its viewers are mostly convicts who get credit on
their work-release program for watching.
   Meanwhile, back at the clinic, Stratford's long-suffering
girlfriend (De Lane Matthews in a one-time guest shot) must make an
appointment _ and pay the bill _ if she wants to see the doctor.
``I'd like my key back,'' she tells him. He is confused. ``How will
I get into your apartment?'' he asks.
   There's yet another plotline about an elderly patient who steals
Dierdre's Porsche, and Stratford still has time to philosophize with
Abe, who offers the advice, ``Take a chill pill, homeboy,'' when
Stratford expresses his disillusionment. ``Why is it,'' Stratford
ponders, doing an exaggerated soul walk, ``whenever you don't have
an answer, you always get so `street'?''
   In the midst of reruns of made-for-TV movies we didn't like the
first time around, ``Doctor, Doctor'' is a dose of welcome relief.
Enjoy, enjoy.

continuing effort to analyze every aspect of American television
viewing habits, has determined that most recording on VCRs _ 51

interestingly, 31 percent of all taping occurs with the television

<HEAD>Vessel With Soviet Capacity May Be In Alaska's Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite early hopes, the giant Soviet oil
skimmer Vaidogubsky has been less than salvation in the messy war on
this nation's worst oil spill, but the vessel wears its oil stains
and smudges like badges of honor.
   ``If we could have gotten here sooner ...,'' Sergey P. Rekin,
master of the 425-foot ship, said through an interpreter. ``But
under the circumstances, we thought we accomplished more than
expected.''
   Had the 11,400-ton vessel arrived immediately after the March 24
spill, ``we could have picked up all of it,'' said Rekin, who has
been a sailor for 20 of his 38 years. ``With good organization it
would have been possible.''
   The ship arrived in Seward 26 days after the spill.
   One of Alaska's top environmental officials said a ship with the
Vaidogubsky's capabilities should be based in Alaska.
   ``We're kidding ourselves after what we've seen in the last nine
weeks if we think we don't need one,'' said Bill Lamoreaux of the
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation. ``That ship and
other pieces of equipment ... in this particular case would have
made a lot of difference.''
   Lamoreaux said the state has not completed its contingency
planning, and could mandate that a large vessl be stationed in the
sound to handle spills in rough seas.
   ``It's a combination of capacity and size,'' Lamoreaux said.
``With the weather out there, we can't have a bunch of Tonka Toys
out there.''
   And he said the likelihood nowadays of the state making such a
requirement stick are much better. ``It would have been a political
impossibility before the spill,'' he said. ``Everybody realizes the
real truth. It's going to take a new perspective.''
   The 987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef early on Good
Friday, changing forever the way Alaskans view the oil industry's
ability to sop up a major spill.
   The vessel spewed into the once-pristine sound about 11 million
gallons of North Slope crude oil. It has washed up on beaches spread
over 700 miles between Prince William Sound to the Alaska Peninsula.
   The Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. and Exxon were chastised for
their response immediately after the spill and their inability to
control the oil.
   The weather immediately after the accident was exceptional for
the sound. It was calm. But as the seas picked up, the few small
skimmers deployed could not safely handle the spreading slick.
   The 3-year-old Vaidogubsky, owned by the Soviet Oil Ministry's
Far East Maritime Marine Oil and Gas Development Co., normally is
based at the Soviet Union's Sakhalin Island, where oil development
is under way, Rekin said. It was hired on April 11.
   This is the first major spill the vessel has been called upon to
clean up.
   ``We spent 10 days on standby. The reason was there was no
central location, no point to talk to,'' he said. ``To have a
quicker response, you have to have a center to mobilize from. You
have to be able to tell the condition and location of the oil. We
had to try trial and error.''
   The Vaidogubsky _ the only vessel of its kind in the world _
reached Seward from its home base on April 19 as oil menaced much of
the state's southcentral coastline.
   Plagued by poor weather, rough seas and crude weathered to the
consistency of taffy, the $42 million skimmer and dredge ship has
managed to work only 40 hours since its arrival, siphoning up about
82,000 gallons of oil.
   ``We had the weather against us,'' said Rekin. He said the delay
in summoning his vessel pared its effectiveness. ``If we could have
gotten here even a week earlier, we could have done hundreds of
percent more.
   ``Many of these ships should be placed around to the world to
react quickly. It would be cheaper than what they are spending now.''
   Exxon spokesman Karsten Rodvik said his company has spent more
than $200 million on the spill cleanup.
   The Vaidogubsky's skimmers could not deal with the mousse, so its
crew, working 12- to 16-hour days, managed to jury rig the vessel's
120-ton dredge assemblies to slurp up oil when the weather allowed
and the heavy crude could be located, he said.
   Hired by VECO, an Exxon contractor, for a reported $15,000 a day,
the large ship worked on the spill until about May 12, when it was
made available to the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. for use as an
emergency response vessel.
   Alyeska is moving to comply with a state emergency order that,
among other things, mandates the company be able to recover 10,000
barrels, or 420,000 gallons, of oil an hour if another accident
happens. The Vaidogubsky can gulp 200,000 gallons an hour under
optimum conditions, with a storage capacity of 2 million gallons.
   The Soviet skimmer docked in this Prince William Sound community
last week. Hundreds of residents and tourists clambered aboard.
Children handed seamen flowers and gifts.
   Absorbent pads and boom littered the deck. The vessel's heavy
equipment _ manufactured in the United States, Finland, Norway _
showed use.
   Its crew members attended oil spill response training in Valdez
with Alyeska workers. ``They have their own way of operating. They
just need to know what to expect from us. We need to know what to
expect from them,'' said Tom Brennan, a spokesman for Alyeska.
   The skimmer left Valdez on Wednesday, and headed for Knowles
Head, 110 miles to the southwest. The area is shallow and a common
anchorage for tankers waiting to pick up cargo at Valdez, Brennan
said.
   ``It's assignment is basically to sit on station out at Knowles
Head, just inside Hinchinbrook Entrance,'' Brennan said. ``It's a
sort of second line of defense in the event of an oil spill.''
   He said tugs and work boats hauling containment booms and other
gear accompany tankers out of Valdez under the new regulations. They
would act as a first line of defense.
   Eventually, perhaps by mid- or late July, the Soviet vessel will
be replaced by a tug boat and a specially equipped barge with a
high-capacity skimmer, Brennan said.
   ``We think this is a better way to go,'' Brennan said. ``It has a
smaller crew and a higher capacity.'' He said he was unsure of the
replacement skimmer's capacity.
   ``The equipment that we'll have will work more effectively than
the Vaidogubsky. We're trying to find the best equipment for the
job.''

<HEAD>It's A Risky Job, But FDIC Chairman Wants to Oversee S&amp;L Rescue</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bill Seidman may be riding into dangerous
territory, but you wouldn't know it to talk with him.
   As chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., Seidman has
become the central figure in the government's effort to manage and
resolve the savings and loan crisis.
   That's a risky role. Beyond the problem of getting the rescue
under way lies the likelihood that what is going on now may be a
first installment _ a giant one _ with more costs to come. And the
man who rides to the rescue one year can wind up being blamed the
next, when the problem doesn't go away.
   But Seidman is in a role he clearly relishes. He says most
bureaucrats operate under a flag that reads ``Not on my watch,''
sidestepping problems until somebody else arrives to deal with them.
Seidman wants the S&amp;L crisis handled on his watch.
   Under a bailout bill that is inching through Congress, Seidman's
FDIC, the agency that keeps supervisory watch on commercial banks
and insures their depositors, will take control of the bankrupt
insurance fund that does the same things in the savings and loan
industry.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., insurer of savings
and loan depositors, needs more than $50 billion just to get even.
It will take at least three times that sum to salvage the industry,
closing or reorganizing insolvent S&amp;Ls and paying off their
depositors.
   The administration estimates the cost at $157 billion over the
next 10 years. The General Accounting Office puts the price at $285
billion over 30 years. There's never been a bailout to match it.
Nor, as Seidman has observed, have the taxpayers ever had to spend
that kind of money without getting anything in exchange.
   He blames it on a failure of the system, political and
regulatory, Democratic and Republican.
   Seidman _ L. William is the name on the letterhead _ is 67, an
accountant by trade, a Republican by politics. He's managed
campaigns, served as an economic affairs aide in Gerald R. Ford's
White House, was dean of the business school at Arizona State
University, and has been chairman of the FDIC since 1985.
   He said one of the lessons for voters is that they should demand
campaign spending reform and congressional ethics legislation, to
control the influence of special interests. The savings and loan
lobby was a powerful one _ and still is, even in crisis.
   ``Here they are lobbying to do the same thing that just cost the
taxpayer $100 billion and they're winning _ at least to some extent
they're winning,'' he said in an interview.
   The Senate passed the S&amp;L bill on April 19. Four House committees
then had a crack at it. So did the savings and loan lobby. That
produced a crop of amendments, some to ease the impact on the
industry, some written in terms tailored to individual institutions.
   Seidman knows something about lobbying, too. The Senate version
of the bill would strengthen his hand beyond the administration's
original proposal. He's at work on the House bill now.
   Seidman's term as chairman runs until the fall of 1991. Under the
Senate bill, he'd stay; the version awaiting House action would
entitle President Bush to appoint a new chairman. ``No one knows how
it comes out,'' Seidman said.
   In reality, the chances of a change are slim to none. Seidman has
his detractors in Congress, especially among allies of the S&amp;L
establishment. But there is far wider support, and it is one of the
reasons the legislation puts such broad power in the hands of his
agency.
   The S&amp;L meter is running; the Treasury estimates that bailout
costs go up $10 million every day until the bill is law. The
administration has threatened a veto if the bill comes back altered
to put $50 billion in S&amp;L costs into the budget and therefore onto
the deficit. Even without that dispute, the bill probably won't
reach the president until late July. Seidman said the budget issue
isn't nearly as important as getting a bill the president will sign
this summer. ``There's an urgent need for it,'' he said.
   At the same time, he is fighting an industry effort to let S&amp;Ls
count something called ``supervisory good will'' in lieu of capital,
which means money. It involves the difference between what
purchasers paid to take over shaky S&amp;Ls and their actual value,
which was substantially lower.
   To an accountant, Seidman said, that's the opposite of good will.
``It's air,'' he said. ``And in this case, it's bad air.''
   That and scores of other issues must be settled before the
salvage operation can even begin. ``Every word in that bill costs
somebody money, or turf, or something else,'' Seidman said.
   Then comes the hard part _ what he calls ``an unbelievably
difficult job'' in taking over the supervisory and insurance
operation while, at the same time, a new regulatory operation at the
Treasury liquidates insolvent S&amp;Ls. ``That's going to be very
unpleasant,'' he said.
   ``Whoever gets that task probably ought not to think about
running for president _ or even for dog catcher,'' Seidman said.
``... I'm sure we'll have a role in it.''

<BYLINE>LaserPhotos RM1,2 and NY302 of June 9    EDITOR'S NOTE _ The case
seemed too strange for truth. A man wanted in the murders of his entire
family is apprehended 18 years later by FBI agents working on tips from
people who had seen a plaster bust on a TV show the man himself counted
among his favorites. To track the fugitive years of John Emil List, AP
Regional Reporter Strat Douthat traveled to Virginia and Colorado, spoke
with neighbors, pastors, colleagues, a childhood friend of one of his dead
sons, and a woman who recalled List as a boy in Michigan. This is his report
of List, and how he gave himself away.    ___ ^By STRAT DOUTHAT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the years following the methodical
murders of his wife, mother and three children in New Jersey, John
Emil List painstakingly created a new identity for himself in the
foothills of the Rockies.
   He dyed his hair and used a new name to acquire new credit cards
and a phony Social Security number. He took a new wife, to whom he
lied about his age and personal history.
   But List was finally tripped up after two decades because his new
persona was created in his own image _ that of a wimpy, bespectacled
accountant whose life centered on the Lutheran Church.
   When Fox Broadcasting Co. aired his case last month on its ``Most
Wanted'' television show, more than 200 tipsters thought they
recognized the former ``mama's boy'' from Bay City, Mich.
   Authorities said two of the tips _ one from Richmond, Va.,
another from Denver _ led them to a mild-mannered accountant in
Midlothian, Va., a devout Lutheran layman whose fingerprints matched
those of fugitive John E. List.
   The balding bookkeeper arrested by FBI agents June 1 says he is
Robert P. Clark, a former resident of Denver who moved to the
Richmond area 18 months ago.
   The FBI says Clark is merely the identity List developed after
fleeing to Colorado after the Nov. 9, 1971, slayings in Westfield,
N.J., an affluent bedroom community 15 miles west of New York City.
   In Denver, Clark's acquaintances say they find it hard to believe
he is List. They remember him as a quiet, kind, intensely private
man who worked, first as a cook, later as a bookkeeper in a series
of small, obscure companies. They say he spent much of his leisure
time in church-related activities.
   ``He was a man who would never, ever stand out in a crowd,'' said
Carole Burton, manager of the eastside Denver apartment complex
where Clark lived from September 1978 to November 1985.
   Flipping through his tenant file, she marveled, ``I've never seen
anything like this in all the years I've been here. The man did
absolutely nothing to call attention to himself. There are no
complaints in his file, no notices, no record of repairs, no
nothing.''
   Denver FBI agents say they received no information about the
fugitive living in their midst for 16 years after the grisly
``ballroom murders.''
   Even now a chill runs through James Moran, Westfield's retired
police chief, when he recalls the scene at the sparsely furnished,
18-room mansion that List bought in 1966, using his mother's
inheritance to finance the $50,000 purchase.
   ``It was so methodical, so cold-blooded,'' Moran said. ``We found
his mother up in her third-floor apartment. She and his wife were
still in their bedclothes. He even had turned the thermostat down to
50 degrees to preserve the bodies.''
   Moran said the first two killings occurred sometime in the
morning.
   ``Then he apparently did some errands while waiting all day long
for the children to come home. And when they did, he shot them, one
by one. The bodies of the wife and children were laid out on
sleeping bags in the ballroom, off of the kitchen. They had been
laid out in a neat row, head to toe,'' Moran said.
   The victims _ List's mother, Alma, 85; his wife, Helen, 45; and
their three children, Patricia, 16, John Jr., 15, and Frederick, 13
_ weren't discovered until the evening of Dec. 7, 1971, nearly a
month after their deaths.
   By that time John Emil List was long gone.
   An investigation showed that List, at the time a 45-year-old
accountant with an annual salary of $12,000, had two mortgages on
his house, totaling $40,000. Moran said List had told people his
wife was an alcoholic spendthrift who nagged him constantly.
   The investigation revealed that List had for years been siphoning
money from his mother's $200,000 savings account. ``He took out the
last $2,000 on the day of the killings,'' said Moran, who found the
withdrawal slip while searching the house.
   He also found and read a rambling, five-page confessional letter
List had written to his pastor in Westfield.
   ``He wrote of being under a lot of pressure, but I can't reveal
anything else,'' said Moran. ``The letter will be used as evidence
if he goes to trial.'' List is charged with five counts of
first-degree murder.
   He had told school officials he was taking his children to visit
relatives, Moran said. List's car, a green 1963 Chevy Impala, was
found at Kennedy Airport three days after the bodies were discovered.
   ``I rode in that old car lots of times, going to baseball
practice with John Jr.,'' recalls Robert Compton, now a Westfield
police officer. ``John and I were classmates and were on the same
baseball team. ... His dad used to go to the ball games. When they
found him, John Jr. had been shot nine times.''
   Authorities aren't certain just when List arrived in the Denver
area and began building his new life. However, a Denver man says he
met Robert P. Clark in Golden in early 1973, slightly more than a
year after the murders.
   At the time, said Robert Wetmore, a 72-year-old retired ranch
hand, Clark was working at the Holiday Inn in this cowboy town just
west of Denver.
   ``Bob was in the kitchen, working as a fry cook,'' recalled
Wetmore. ``He was working the night shift and I cleaned the kitchen.
We became friends, you might say.''
   Wetmore said Clark then lived in a ramshackle trailer park on the
outskirts of Golden.
   ``Bob didn't have a car at the time so I helped him move out of
the trailer park into an apartment a few blocks east of the motel,''
he said. ``He didn't have much stuff then, but later, when I helped
him move again, he had begun to acquire more possessions.''

   Clark held several cooking jobs in the early `70s and moved
frequently, Wetmore said. He usually chose large apartment complexes
where he could easily remain anonymous.
   ``Bob didn't talk much about his past,'' Wetmore said. ``Once,
when I asked him, he said he was from Michigan.''
   That was not a lie. John Emil List was born 63 years ago in Bay
City, Mich., the son of a wealthy German immigrant grocer who had
married, for the second time, late in life.
   Laura Werner, who rented an apartment from the family, remembers
List as a sweet, little mama's boy.
   ``He and his mother were very close,'' Werner said. ``She had
married in her 30s and John was her only child. He was the apple of
her eye.''
   She said List, who spoke fluent German, attended a Lutheran
elementary school and later went to public high school. He joined
the Army in World War II and attended the University of Michigan
upon being discharged.
   List worked in Detroit and Kalamazoo, Mich., before rejoining the
Army in the Korean War. He was stationed at Fort Eustace, Va., when
he met his wife, who had been previously married and had a daughter.
   List later worked in Rochester, N.Y., and Jersey City, N.J.,
before taking his family to Westfield in 1955.
   Little of this past did List, as Clark, ever reveal.
   Once, when Wetmore asked his friend if he had a family anywhere,
it touched a nerve. ``He snapped at me, `No family!''' Wetmore
recalled. ``That was the only time I ever saw Bob show any anger.''
   Gary Morrison, a former chef at the motel, remembered Clark
saying he had once been married but his wife had died of cancer.
   In 1975, Clark joined St. Paul's Lutheran Church in downtown
Denver.
   The pastor, Rev. Bob West, said Clark became a pillar of the
church during the 11 years he attended, even serving on the board.
   ``I once asked Bob how he happened to choose us, and he said it
was because we were on the bus line,'' recalled West.
   At a church singles party in 1977, Clark met Delores Miller, a
40-year-old divorcee. By then, he owned a 1974 Volkswagen and had
gotten back into accounting, working for a company that made
cardboard boxes.
   Clark moved in with Miller in November 1985. They were married a
month later.
   ``Delores never told me about Bob,'' said Wanda Flanery, Miller's
neighbor in Denver. ``I didn't meet him until he moved in.''
   She said the newlyweds were a lot alike, both being quiet,
reserved people who were devoted to their Lutheran faith.
   In April 1986, Clark was laid off. His wife's salary as a clerk
at the Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center was not enough to support the
newlyweds, and they began to slip in their monthly payments.
   For 18 months, Clark kept house and always had dinner waiting for
his wife, Flanery recalled. In late 1987, Clark answered an ad from
a Virginia employment agency that set up interviews with a Richmond
accounting firm.
   Clark left Denver in February 1988 to take the new job, just as
the company was getting busy with tax season. Four months later, his
wife joined him in Midlothian, a suburb southwest of Richmond.
   ``Delores had mixed emotions about leaving,'' recalled Flanery,
who said they had been neighbors and friends for five years. ``She
said she really didn't want to leave Denver but Bob had been out of
work since shortly after they were married and he had finally found
this job in Virginia.''
   Flanery received two letters from Delores Clark after she moved
away. Her friend referred to recurring financial problems and said
she might have made a mistake leaving Denver.
   To make ends meet, Clark had begun moonlighting for H&amp;R Block,
and his wife started working one day a week in a hairdressing salon.
   ``Delores called me on this past Mother's Day,'' Flanery said.
``That was the last I heard from her before Bob was arrested.''
   Clark was picked up 11 days after the ``Most Wanted'' broadcast
dramatized the ballroom murders. The program, one that Clark watched
regularly and often recommended to neighbors, featured a plaster
bust portraying List as he might look now.
   ``I said, `That's Bob,''' Flanery recalled. ``I told my
son-in-law to call the FBI and give them Bob and Delores' address in
Virginia.''
   After her husband's arrest, Delores Clark told the FBI she
couldn't believe he was a murderer. At a news conference Thursday,
she described Clark as a good husband who had a deep and abiding
faith in God.
   Clark had told her he had been married previously but that his
wife had died of cancer prior to his coming to Denver, she said. He
told her he had no children.
   Wanda Flanery says Clark's arrest shouldn't come as a complete
shock to her friend.
   ``A couple of years ago I bought a supermarket tabloid that
contained an article on the List murder case,'' she said. ``The
article had a sketch of how List might look now and it was a
deadringer for Bob.
   ``I took the paper next door and showed it to Delores. She turned
pale and kept looking at it, saying, `Oh, my! Oh, my!'''
   Flanery recalls asking Delores Clark if she thought her husband
actually was John List.
   ``Finally, Delores shook her head and said, `That's not my
husband.' I then dared her to show it to Bob and ask him, but I
don't think she ever did. She's not a strong person and I don't
think she felt she could have faced the truth so she just let it
lie.''
   Delores Clark acknowledged at her news conference that she had
dismissed the magazine article from her mind and had never shown it
to her husband.
   Does Flanery have any regrets about her role in Clark's arrest?
   ``I did what I thought was best,'' she said. ``For all I knew
Delores was in danger. If he did it once, he could have done it
again, especially since they were having financial problems.''

   ``We will bury you,'' Nikita S. Khrushchev once
told a group of Western ambassadors in Moscow in 1956. But today, a
generation later, the communism the late Soviet leader saw as
triumphing is showing symptoms of critical illness _ in the halls of
parliament in Moscow, the voting booths of Poland and the blood of
Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

<TEXT>
   The killings in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and the
ballot-box rebuff of Poland's communist leaders have presented world
communism with its most dramatic challenge since the 1950s.
   Coming on top of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet
Union, these events have turned a crisis into a cataclysm for
communists everywhere, raising immense hopes alongside despair.
   In the communist world, the divide between reformists and
hard-liners is sharpening. For Westerners, the Polish election a
week ago is an ideological triumph, the Chinese army shooting and
beating students in Tiananmen Square its bleak counterpoint.
   ``Communist ideology is at its end,'' declares West Germany's
conservative chancellor, Helmut Kohl.
   Says David Selbourne, a British political analyst just back from
Eastern Europe: ``We are living in a revolutionary age.''
   Not since the 1950s, when the Soviet Red Army quelled the
Hungarian uprising and Stalin's mass murder began coming to light,
has the communist world undergone such a wrenching experience as
watching a People's Liberation Army kill its own people.
   Meanwhile, events in Poland raise the possibility, hitherto
undreamed of, that the country may ultimately spurn communism
altogether and become a Western-style democracy.
   The election, says Timothy Garton Ash, a British author and
journalist who travels extensively in Eastern Europe, has been ``a
milestone ... in the history of the communist world since 1917.''
   Communism's crisis had been building for a long time before it
turned to cataclysm during the first weekend in June.
   The communist monolith, born of the writings of the 19th-century
philosopher Karl Marx, implanted in Russia by the 1917 revolution
and then exported all over the world, was already splintering in
Eastern Europe.
   Poland and Hungary were embarked on bold experiments with
democracy and capitalism, and Yugoslavia threatened to disintegrate
under the weight of ethnic rivalries.
   The Soviet Union itself had experimented with semi-free
elections, resulting in humiliation for the old guard and a
parliament where lively debate was being heard for the first time
since the 1920s.
   Until now, whatever changes were taking place were within the
confines of communism. Moscow and Warsaw might adopt some facets of
capitalism, but there was never any question of jettisoning
communism as the state ideology.
   But under President Gorbachev, the very meaning of the word
``communism'' had become blurred. He has eschewed the brutal legacy
of a centralized police state bequeathed by Stalin, and instead
voiced allegiance to ``Leninist principles,'' a vast and often
contradictory corpus of doctrine that gives him more room for
maneuver.
   The election in Poland, in which the Solidarity trade union
movement scored a landslide victory in the seats it was allowed to
contest, demonstrated a massive rejection of Polish communist policy.
   Asked by The Independent newspaper of London whether at the next
election in 1993 the communists could be voted out altogether, party
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski replied: ``It is logical that if you
talk about free elections, any outcome is possible.''
   It represented a remarkable turnaround from eight years ago, when
Jaruzelski imposed martial law to snuff out Solidarity.
   The effect of this ``great geopolitical shift from communism to
democracy,'' as the British political commentator Ferdinand Mount
described it in the London Daily Telegraph, is felt among Western
communists too.
   Their agony over Tiananmen Square was undisguised, with the
Morning Star, British communism's daily newspaper, drawing comfort
only from the fact that the students confronting the Chinese army
were singing The Internationale, the anthem of communism.
   In Italy, the Communist Party sees its support slipping, and
openly discusses dropping the word ``Communist'' from its name. In
France, veteran Communist leader Georges Marchais worries aloud that
events in China might hurt his party's election prospects.
   Gorbachev's policies of openness and perestroika, or
restructuring, are highly popular with Western public opinion, and
the Western Communist parties have wholeheartedly boarded the
bandwagon.
   ``Gorbachev has meant a far more positive development in the
Soviet Union than we thought possible just a few years ago,'' says
Kenneth Kvist, secretary of the Swedish Communist Party.
   Achille Occhetto, secretary of the Italian Communist Party, says:
``In the countries of the East, communism is a term that no longer
has any relation with its own historic origins. ... They are regimes
that will lead to catastrophic ends if they don't move toward
parliamentary and pluralistic democracy.''

   Communism's decline is accentuated when compared with the
decade-long ascendancy of conservatism in the West, led by Ronald
Reagan in the United States and Margaret Thatcher in Britain.
   Mrs. Thatcher has led nothing less than a conservative
revolution, in which her attack on long-cherished institutions like
free health care and trade union power have painted her as the
reforming radical.
   Political analyst Selbourne, who recently visited Poland and
Hungary, says he was astonished to find leaders there who ``are
honest enough to admit that their system isn't working economically
and who are not embarrassed to admit their admiration for Mrs.
Thatcher.''
   Says Martin Jacques, editor of the British journal Marxism Today:
``The systems produced after the Second World War are up for grabs.''
   The conservative decade has coincided with the global explosion
of high technology, the field in which communism now lags most
seriously. In a world of instant communication and computerized
knowledge, regimes that jail people for unauthorized use of a
photocopying machine cannot but fall behind.
   Even Vietnam, which spilled so much blood to give its people
communism, is trying to open its economy to the West, and government
economists there express open contempt for state-run enterprises.
   Not all, however.
   Cuba, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria rigidly resist
change. Romania's policy of forced urbanization of the peasantry has
provoked worldwide outcry. Albania continues to plow its lonely
Stalinist furrow, spurning both the Soviet Union and China.
   While the official media in Poland, Hungary and Yugoslavia were
denouncing the killings and beatings in Beijing, Cuba and East
Germany were cleaving to the official Chinese line of blaming the
violence on counter-revolutionaries who attacked the army.
   Some Western right-wingers are inclined to gloat at communism's
predicament.
   Cartoonist Jacques Faizant of the Paris newspaper le Figaro
pictured a middle-class Frenchman demanding an apology from the
``self-styled Maoists'' who broke his shop windows and burned his
car during the Paris student uprising of May 1968.
   But the more prevalent sentiment is shock, incredulity and a
sense that historic events are unfolding: ``One of the great
punctuation marks of 20th-century history,'' as London's
left-of-center Guardian newspaper put it.
   How should the West react?
   Selbourne believes it is torn between jumping in to shore up the
reformist regimes with aid, and standing aside and waiting for
communism to die.
   Garton Ash, writing in The Independent, suggests Western Europe
should show the way by setting up a European Development Agency
offering the Poles advice and business loans.
   But Mount, in The Telegraph, said the Chinese bloodbath has
vindicated the cautious approach led by Mrs. Thatcher, Reagan and
now President Bush.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher's ... admiration for Mr. Gorbachev is
undiminished, her confidence that he will succeed is rather
dimmer,'' he wrote. And Tiananmen Square makes it ``harder to
believe in the inevitable peaceful transformation of communism.''

Photographer Amy Sancetta.    EDITOR'S NOTE _ There have been highs and
lows in young Karen Kocharian's sojourn in the United States. The Armenian
boy can now use his hand, which had been just a stub before surgery in
Philadelphia. He has made friends. At the same time, he's sorely missed
family members and his homeland. This is the final part of an intermittent
series tracing Karen's progress.    ___ ^By BRUCE RULE</BYLINE>

   He promises to write thank-yous to everybody
when he gets home, using the new fingers on his right hand.
   But now it's time to go for 10-year-old Karen Kocharian, who came
here for four months of treatment after being badly hurt when an
earthquake struck his native Armenia last December.
   ``He cries for his mother every night.'' As his father, Sarkis,
spoke those words, Karen nodded and looked away.
   When father and son leave Tuesday on an Aeroflot flight, Karen
will leave behind the uncertainties he arrived with four months ago.
Would surgeons be able to transfer two toes from his left foot to
his finger-less right hand? Would the delicate joining of blood
vessels and the connecting of nerves really work? Would he use the
hand again?
   Dr. Lee Osterman, who conducted the transplant operation in March
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said last week that Karen's
hand is doing well. Progress is, as expected, slow but steady. The
fingers are encased in a ball of flesh, and next year Osterman will
travel to Armenia to cut the fingers apart.
   But while he's been recovering and making friends at the
hospital, at home the boy has turned more quiet and withdrawn.
   ``He misses his mother very much,'' said Alice Ohanian, whose
family was host to the Kocharians, she said. ``I'm happy for him
because he will see her soon.''
   Karen said he also wants to go home so his younger brother can
play with all the presents he has received.
   His father, too, is eager to get back now that Karen's treatment
is finished. The Kocharians had been scheduled to return on June 30
and were visiting Washington, D.C., with an Armenian-American group
when the pressure on the 34-year-old Sarkis got to be too much.
   They had visited some of the sights _ Karen especially liked the
paintings in the U.S. Capitol _ and were en route to Arlington
Cemetery when Sarkis could not go on. He thought of the tens of
thousands of Armenians killed in the earthquake.
   ``I feel guilty that we have not been able to go to the graves of
my loved ones yet,'' Sarkis said.
   He contacted the Soviet Embassy to see if their departure date
could be moved up. Project Hope, which had brought Karen and 36
other children to America for treatment, had said there were no
available seats on Aeroflot until June 30. The embassy arranged two
seats for Tuesday's flight.
   ``I miss my family, my wife, my country,'' said Sarkis, a stocky
car mechanic with specks of gray in his hair.
   ``People will doubt my wanting to go back but they should stay
away from home for four months,'' Sarkis said, adding, ``Especially
in the way I left my family.''
   He said he is too focused on going home to think of what he'll
miss about America _ but he likes U.S. cigarettes and has become
accustomed to the great variety of items available in stores.
   He likes the United States, he said _ ``You can express
yourself.''
   Asked what he will miss, Karen doesn't hesitate: ``Cars.''
American vehicles have fascinated him and he'll return with a pile
of photos of the ones he likes most.
   People from across the country have sent Karen all types of toy
cars, along with other toys and clothing.
   Originally there was a question of whether the Kocharians would
be allowed to take home all the presents they were given, but Soviet
officials later said they could bring about 145 pounds each when
they board the plane.
   Of all the presents, Karen's prize possession is a 10-speed
bicycle from the Ohanian family.
   He had never been on a bike when it was presented as a birthday
gift in April. At the party, he bravely jumped on, using his
bandaged hand for balancing.
   A family friend ran alongside for a short while, then let Karen
go alone. He rode straight, but landed in the ditch when he
attempted to turn around.
   Laughing, he jumped right back on the bike and by the end of the
day had conquered it.
   ``He's a fast learner,'' said Dore DiBerardino, his occupational
therapist. ``And ambitious _ he wants to try everything.''
   Naturally right-handed, he is making progress toward becoming
``left-dominant,'' she said.
   Karen, now wearing untied sneakers and longer hair like American
kids, no longer hides his scarred hand.
   ``When he walked down the hall you'd see him pull his shirt
sleeve over his hand,'' said Ms. DiBerardino.
   George Ohanian, Alice's husband, encouraged him to uncover the
hand, which now looks like a thumb and a large ball of flesh. ``He's
got to get used to people looking at it so when he gets home he'll
be used to the kids teasing him,'' Ohanian said.
   The Ohanians, meanwhile, plan to visit the Kocharians this fall.
Sarkis insisted: ``My family wants to show them the same hospitality
they have shown us.''
   And Karen would like to visit America again. ``Maybe next year,''
he said.
   At their last meeting, Dr. Osterman wanted to check Karen's hand
movement, so he asked the boy to write on a pad.
   In clear letters, in Armenian, Karen wrote, ``Goodbye America.''

<TEXT>
   One of the more memorable remarks about communism vs. capitalism
was that of Nikita S. Khrushchev _ ``We will bury you.''
   It was made at a reception for Poland's Wladyslaw Gomulka in the
Polish Embassy in Moscow on Nov. 18, 1956, and was directed at
Western ambassadors present.
   As reported at the time, the Soviet leader said:
   ``About the capitalist states, it doesn't depend on you whether
or not we exist. If you don't like us, don't accept our invitations,
and don't invite us to come and see you. Whether you like it or not,
history is on our side. We will bury you.''
   On Sept. 16, 1959, during his visit to the United States, he was
asked at the National Press Club in Washington to explain what he
meant by his remark. He replied:
   ``The expression I used was distorted, and on purpose, because
what was meant was not the physical burial of any people but the
question of the historical force of development. It is well known
that at the present time no one social or economic system is
dominant throughout the world, but that there are different systems,
social systems in different countries. And those systems change. At
one time the most widespread system of society in the world was
feudalism. Then capitalism took its place. ... We believe that Karl
Marx, Engels and Lenin gave scientific proof of the fact that the
system, the social system of socialism, would take the place of
capitalism ... that is why I said that looking at the matter from
the historical point of view, socialism, communism, would take the
place of capitalism and capitalism thereby would be, so to speak,
buried.''
   On Aug. 24, 1963, Khrushchev told Westerners in an address at
Split, Yugoslavia:
   ``I once said, `We will bury you,' and I got into trouble with
it. Of course we will not bury you with a shovel. Your own working
class will bury you.''

<HEAD>Strong Dollar Puts Stocks In The Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While takeovers and falling interest rates have
been getting most of the credit, many analysts say the stock
market's buoyant showing in recent weeks owes a lot to the strength
of the dollar in foreign exchange.
   The dollar's rise against such other key currencies as the
Japanese yen and the West German mark has helped attract
international investors into U.S. investments.
   Beyond that, it has been widely welcomed as a sign of increasing
optimism about the overall outlook for the American economy.
   ``The big story of 1989 is certainly the almighty dollar and its
miraculous effect on financial markets, inflation expectations and
euphoric confidence around the world,'' said Rao Chalasani, an
analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.
   ``The dollar has become the strong commodity in short supply,
whereas real and precious commodities are heading south.''
   At the beginning of 1989, notes economist Maury Harris at
PaineWebber Inc., the consensus of 38 forecasters polled by the Wall
Street Journal called for a dollar exchange rate of 121 yen by
midyear. As of late last week, the dollar was worth just under 145
yen.
   One widely accepted explanation for this unexpected turn of
events has been the perception that inflation, while it is picking
up in many other countries, is starting to slow in the United States
along with the pace of business activity.
   What has surprised many observers has been the dollar's continued
advance as interest rates have dropped lately in this country while
they have moved up in many places overseas.
   Money tends, it is presumed, to flow to wherever interest rates
provide the most generous yields.
   Harris, however, says that misses a key point. Dollar investments
have remained attractive to foreign investors, he argues, ``because
investors were focusing on prospective capital gains in stocks and
bonds if interest rates continue falling.''
   James Grant, editor of the newsletter Grant's Interest Rate
Observer, says politics also have played an important part, noting
that the dollar and the Swiss franc have been the strongest
currencies of late.
   ``What the world used to want was yield,'' Grant observes. ``The
financial significance of the Chinese revolution is that the world,
at least temporarily, seems to want safety.
   ``What the United States and Switzerland have in common is that
each is hard to invade and each is creating fewer dollars and
francs, respectively, than it used to.''
   In the past week, stocks suffered an early setback, but recovered
most of their losses. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed
Friday at 2,513.42, down 4.41 from the previous week's post-crash
high.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.88 to 182.37;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
2.02 to 453.65, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
climbed 5.69 to 366.16, reaching a record high.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 190.05 million shares a day,
against 194.15 million the week before.
   As big a plus as it may be, analysts point out, an extended rally
in the dollar could well have some negative implications sooner or
later for stocks.
   ``Industries with large foreign operations face the prospect of
having their foreign-denominated earnings translate into fewer
dollars,'' says Jack Lavery, research director at Merrill Lynch.
   ``Export-based industries may find themselves in a less favorable
competitive position because of a stronger dollar.''
   But for the moment, at least, the dollar's gains have been, in
Harris's words, ``a bullish surprise for the U.S. financial
markets.''

<HEAD>Tortuous Events in China Usher In Big Economic Chill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's bloody political contortions have
troubled millions of Americans transfixed by horrific scenes on
television, but a broad economic impact also looms for the Chinese
and threatens U.S. business relationships that have taken nearly two
decades to cultivate.
   The sudden, panicky mass exodus of foreigners this past week from
the People's Republic because of the violent crackdown on a growing
pro-democracy movement portends a dark and chilly era for foreign
investment and trade. Few are expected to quickly return, even if
things quiet down for awhile.
   Although the biggest U.S. multinationals with offices in China
aren't likely to disengage themselves, many smaller companies say
they can't easily afford to risk their money in a country where
political stability is now so uncertain.
   ``The commercial and economic relations between the United States
and China, so carefully nurtured and developed through the efforts
of people on both sides over the past 18 years and so clearly in the
overall strategic interest of both our two countries, have been
disrupted and could suffer long-term damage,'' the U.S. China
Business Council declared.
   Hundreds of joint ventures worth billions of dollars have
suddenly been put on hold or severely curtailed, affecting factory
construction and exports ranging from crude oil to luggage to
hand-held hairdryers.
   China's lucrative tourist trade, which earned more than $2
billion in foreign currency annually for the Chinese, has collapsed
at the busiest time of year. The outlook is uncertain.
   Even foreign-financed projects hundreds of miles from Beijing
have been disrupted, partly because of a State Department warning
that Americans should leave the country due to the threat of
widespread unrest.
   In Shanghai, Douglas Aircraft expatriates vacated a joint-venture
assembly plant and said upon arriving in Hong Kong they had no idea
there was such turmoil in the Chinese capital. In a remote coalfield
southwest of Beijing, Occidental Petroleum temporarily yanked its
staff from an open-pit mine although work had been proceeding
normally.
   In the south, where the bulk of foreign-Chinese joint ventures
have been established, many U.S. businesses reportedly started
making contingency plans to shift production to other cheap-labor
countries such as Mexico, Thailand and the Philippines, fearing
disruption of exports from China.
   On a broader scale, the chaos in China severely jolted the
stability of British-ruled Hong Kong, the financial powerhouse
scheduled to be surrendered to the Chinese in 1997.
   It sent investors fleeing for dollar-denominated investments,
roiling other financial markets. It forced banks to reevaluate their
exposure to debt owed not only by the Chinese but by foreign
companies that rely on Chinese trade.
   Millions of dollars in Chinese-issued bonds, sold abroad to raise
money for economic development, are suddenly worth less and will
aggravate the country's recent efforts to raise money in world
credit markets.
   Economically, there is nothing about the crackdown that bodes
well for China or companies that have banked their future on a
market of 1.1 billion people with rising expectations, China experts
say.
   But some argue that in the long run, the consequences could prove
beneficial by forcing the Beijing government to moderate its
hardline position in order to lure foreigners and their money back.
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _A battle flared for Time Inc., threatening to derail the media
giant's merger with Warner Communications Inc. A $10.7 billion offer
for Time by Paramount Communications Inc. sent Time's stock soaring
and resurrected a theory on Wall Street that no company is immune to
a takeover.
   _A federal jury convicted speculator Paul A. Bilzerian of
securities fraud and tax violations, making him the first takeover
strategist to be prosecuted and convicted using information derived
from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal. Bilzerian planned to
appeal.
   _Banks cut their prime lending rate to 11 percent from 11.5
percent, reflecting a trend toward lower borrowing costs. But it was
uncertain how long the decline would last, because the government
reported a surge in May inflation that could make the Federal
Reserve tighten credit again _ sending rates higher.

   U.S. businesses plan a strong 6.5 percent
increase in plant and equipment spending this year, the government
said, and economists said the investments would help economic
expansion while tending to limit inflation.
   Analysts said Thursday that much of the spending will involve
equipment that would permit businesses to modernize their production
capabilities, thereby reducing both costs and prices.
   According to the Commerce Department survey, completed in May,
business investment is now estimated at $451.43 billion for 1989, up
from $423.69 billion in 1988.

   The advertiser-supported Channel One news service
for teens will be offered to schools nationwide starting in March
1990 and will be packaged with two new educational networks, the
architect of the service said.
   Christopher Whittle, chairman of Whittle Communications, said
Thursday his company expects to spend $200 million on startup costs
involved in giving 8,000 or more schools the video equipment needed
to receive the Channel One programming.
   He intends to pay for it with $85 million to $100 million each
year from advertisers who pay to pitch products on Channel One's
daily news show.

   Fog delayed some flights, makeover artists hadn't
finished rehabbing the old workhorse planes and at least one flight
detoured over Donald Trump's Atlantic City casinos for some
self-serving promotion.
   But the tycoon had no problems providing glitz for Thursday's
debut of his Northeast shuttle airline, newly acquired from
strikebound Eastern Airlines for $365 million.
   Trump flew the shuttle from New York to Washington and back, on
to Boston and back to New York. At every stop, he was greeted as a
conquering hero by ebullient crowds in airport terminals.

   Some of Wall Street's euphoria over Paramount
Communications Inc.'s $10.7 billion bid for Time Inc. appeared to
fade as a number of traders apparently had second thoughts about the
offer or decided to cash in gains on Time stock.
   Time's stock fell $2 a share to $168 Thursday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, after soaring $44 on Wednesday following
Paramount's $175-a-share buyout offer.
   Meanwhile, Paramount stock surged $3.62{ to $58.37{, and stock in
Warner Communications Inc. _ whose planned merger with Time was
thrown into question by the Paramount bid _ rose $3 to $56.50.

   Eastern Airlines presented a contract proposal to
the striking pilots union that seeks temporary pay and vacation
reductions similar to those implemented for non-union workers last
week.
   The proposal was made Thursday at the second official negotiating
session since Eastern was hit by a massive strike March 4.
   It includes a request that pilots take a 10 percent pay cut for
six months and a 5 percent cut during the second six months. After a

<HEAD>Survey: Japanese Worried About EC Protectionism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American, European and Japanese business
executives believe Japan will be the economic power hurt most by the
post-1992 united European market, according to a survey.
   The study, released Thursday, also found that less than a quarter
of U.S. industrial firms have developed a strategic plan to deal
with the coming changes in the European Economic Community.
   More than half of the U.S. executives and nearly two-thirds of
the Japanese surveyed saw Japan as most likely to be affected by
potential protectionism in the EEC, which will establish free
movement of goods, services, capital and labor among its 12 member
states after 1992.
   Japanese business executives in particular believe their products
will be denied entrance into the EEC, according to the study by
Fortune magazine and Ernst &amp; Whinney, an accounting firm that
conducts market research.
   The survey was released at a two-day meeting about the 1992
European initiative that opened Thursday.
   The fear of protectionism has prompted Japanese companies to
develop special European strategies, including building or acquiring
new European manufacturing facilities, the survey reported.
   The survey was based on 1,000 responses to 1,359 questionnaires
sent to the largest Japanese, U.S. and western European industrial
firms.
   Merle Sprinzen, director of market research for Fortune, told the
meeting at the Cini Foundation that ``business leaders tend to agree
that Japanese business would be most hurt. Far fewer believe that
American or European business would suffer.''
   A majority of those interviewed in the survey said Europe also
will enact strong anti-dumping measures, he said.
   ``Japanese executives are more convinced than their American and
EC colleagues that import quotas will also be estabilished,''
Sprinzen said.

<HEAD>Whittle Plans To Take Channel One Service National Next Spring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite the controversy it stirred up, Whittle
Communications is going ahead with plans to sign up schools for its
advertiser-supported Channel One news service for teens and is
including two new educational networks in the package.
   The service, which will debut in March 1990, contains some
modifications of the Channel One program Whittle tested in six
schools earlier this year, Whittle Chairman Christopher Whittle said
Thursday.
   But some critics were not swayed by the modifications, the
inclusion of additional non-commercial programming in the package
and survey results that indicated students learned more about
current events with Channel One.
   ``They sweetened the pot a little bit, but they didn't change the
essential nature of the transaction,'' said Bill Honig, the state
schools superintendent in California. He said Whittle is still
``selling access to your kids'' by letting companies pay to
advertise on a program to be shown during class hours.
   Honig has threatened to withhold a portion of state aid to
schools that air the program to reflect the time Channel One devotes
to pitching products.
   Peggy Charren, who heads a national children's advocacy group,
was also unswayed. ``It's the same deal with better packaging,'' she
said.
   Whittle said his company, based in Knoxville, Tenn., expects to
spend $200 million on startup costs involved in giving 8,000 or more
schools the video equipment needed to receive the Channel One
programming via satellite.
   He intends to pay for it with the $85 million to $100 million
he'll get each year from advertisers to pitch products on Channel
One's daily news show.
   ``We have listened to our critics,'' Whittle told a news
conference. But he said their main complaint about advertising was
``unaddressable.''
   He said that if schools are going to get both a daily news show
and the equipment to show it ``you have to pay for it,'' and added
that the federal government and corporate philanthropists have
failed to do so.
   Nonetheless, Whittle said, he has modified the Channel One
service that was tested for five weeks this past spring and featured
ads for jeans, shampoo, chewing gum, candy bars and acne medication.
   The original Channel One plan required participating schools to
show the daily program to the entire student body every school day.
   But Whittle said schools signing up for Channel One in the future
need not have all of their classrooms wired to receive the program
and need not show it to the whole school.
   However, he said, schools that participate still will be obliged
to show the program every day in those classrooms that have the
equipment.
   He said he hopes to have schools sign up for three to five years
and has not decided what will be done if schools want out of that
contract.
   The schools will receive television sets, video cassette
recorders, satellite dishes and wiring that Whittle said would cost
$40,000 to $50,000 each on average if they were to buy it
themselves. Whittle also will maintain the equipment.
   Three companies are in the running for the hardware contract,
Whittle said: the Videostar unit of Electronic Data Systems Corp.,
Sony Corp. and North American Philips Corp.
   In addition to Channel One, Whittle plans to offer a new service,
the Classroom Channel, that would offer non-commercial educational
programming such as public broadcasting documentaries and
instructional shows.
   The Classroom Channel would be run by a board independent of
Whittle Communications, but Whittle would contribute $500,000 a year
for program rights. Schools could use material on the channel as
they wish.
   Whittle said he also was developing the Educators Channel to
carry programming for teachers, such as briefings by national
education groups.
   No decision has been made on whether the two educational channels
will include advertising. Schools could not receive them, however,
without also signing up for Channel One.
   Whittle plans to make all three networks available in 1,000
middle and high schools in March 1990 and add schools at a rate of
500 or more a month.
   Channel One is not without competition _ and all of it is ad-free.
   Turner Broadcasting System's Cable News Network plans to begin a
daily ad-free news program for schools starting in August, while the
Discovery Channel cable network says it intends to make
commercial-free documentary programming.
   C-Span, the Cable-Satellite Public Affairs Network that provides
coverage of congressional proceedings to cable TV systems, has been
providing programming for use in the classroom since 1986 and said
3,400 teachers already use it. C-Span is expanding that service
starting in late August.
   But those networks are not donating equipment to the schools on
the scale Whittle envisions.

<HEAD>Treasury Department Says Bill Would Cut Revenues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said a bill by Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski, D-Ill., to simplify the corporate minimum tax would
reduce revenue collections by $2.8 billion over the next four years.
   John G. Wilkins, acting assistant secretary for tax policy,
endorsed the bill's goal of removing some complexity from the levy.
But he told a hearing Thursday before the House Ways and Means
revenue subcommittee the measure may need modification because of
budgetary restraints.
   The revenue loss would come from depreciation provisions as the
new version of a minimum tax is phased in, Wilkins said.
   Representatives of several business groups, including the Chamber
of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute and the National
Association of Manufacturers praised the effort but urged additional
changes to accommodate one industry or another.
   Some of the strongest criticism of the bill centered on a
provision that would eliminate the exclusion of half of interest
earned on tax-exempt public-purpose bonds.
   Wiping out that exclusion, said Marjorie O. O'Laughlin, Indiana
state treasurer, would ``have the regrettable effect of
substantially increasing the cost of state and local government
borrowing while simultaneously destabilizing the market for such
bonds by driving away corporate investors.''
   The corporate minimum tax, which is designed to ensure that all
profitable companies pay some tax regardless of deductions, has
undergone several changes since it was enacted in 1969.
Rostenkowski's bill would rewrite some provisions that were enacted
as part of the 1986 tax overhaul.
   Through 1989, the minimum tax is based on the concept of book
income, which is substantially the earnings that a company reports
to stockholders but not to the Internal Revenue Service. Starting in
1990, the law drops the book-income concept and substitutes a
company's ``adjusted current earnings.''
   Under the bill proposed by Rostenkowski, who chairs the Ways and
Means Committee, adjusted current earnings would be eliminated as a
separate item subject to the tax. This would allow companies to make
only one set of calculations in computing their minimum tax.

<TEXT>
   Paramount Communications Inc. made public
Thursday a three-page letter from Time Inc. Chairman J. Richard
Munro in which Munro claimed Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis
broke a promise not to pursue Time.
   ``You've changed the name of your corporation, but it's still
`engulf and devour,' '' Munro wrote. ``Hostile takeovers are a
little like wars: once they start, it's impossible to tell where
they may end. The full effect of what you've set in motion remains
to be seen.
   ``On a personal level, I'm disappointed that I can't rely on you
as a man of your word,'' the letter continued. ``Live and learn.
   ``On a professional level, I regret you've chosen to stake your
company's future on an ill-conceived deal that is cynical if not
downright deceptive.''
   Munro said Time shareholders are being offered ``smoke and
mirrors'' in a deal that ``smacks more of spite than strategy.''
   Davis, in a news release responding to the letter, disputed
Munro's belief that Davis broke his word to Time.
   Davis said he first raised the merger idea about two years ago
and that about a year ago, Time told him it wanted to stay
independent.
   He said that he respected that wish, but that ``when Time Inc.
voluntarily relinquished that independence by entering into its
agreement to sell itself to Warner Communications, the situation
fundamentaly changed _ and we took our offer directly to the Time
Inc. shareholders.''

<HEAD>Eastern Makes Contract Offer to Striking Pilots</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

   Striking pilots at Eastern Airlines dismissed a new
contract proposal from the company as a ``public relations hoax,''
saying the carrier wanted to annul the union's contract rather than
settle the walkout.
   Eastern is seeking temporary pay and vacation cuts similar to
those it imposed on non-union workers last week. The airline needs
the concessions to emerge from bankruptcy, the company said at a
news conference Thursday.
   But the union complained angrily that Eastern announced the
proposal at the news conference before presenting it to union
negotiators. The parties met at their second negotiating session
since the strike began March 4.
   ``Obviously the cameras are more important than the contract,''
said Ron Cole, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Association. ``It's
nothing more than a public relations hoax presented to establish a
paper trail to the doors of the bankruptcy court, where we expect
Eastern will file for abrogation of our contract.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said canceling the pilots'
contract ``is simply an option, one that we would not even address
at this time. ... Our primary thrust is to successfully negotiate a
pilots' contract. That's our focus.''
   Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy five days after it was
crippled by the strike by Machinists, pilots and flight attendants.
   Unions have alleged that Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., plans
to use the bankruptcy proceedings to abrogate its union contracts.
Continental Airlines, which also is owned by Texas Air, rebuilt as a
non-union carrier after filing for bankruptcy in 1983 and canceling
its labor contracts.
   Congress tightened bankruptcy laws after the Continental episode
to make it more difficult for companies to abrogate contracts. Now,
a company must show it is negotiating in good faith.
   The pilots' contract expired in July 1988.
   Even if the pilots accepted the new proposal, Eastern is offering
to take back only 950 union pilots. The airline had 3,500 pilots
before the strike began and will need only 1,700 under its plan to
rebuild to about 65 percent of its prestrike size.
   So far, 760 of spots have been filled. Tom Matthews, Eastern's
senior vice president for human resources, said 260 pilots have
crossed picket lines and 500 new pilots are being trained. Eastern
said it is hiring 50 to 60 new pilots a week.
   The union contends that Eastern can't rebuild without its veteran
union pilots.
   Eastern officials said its offer includes a request that pilots
take a 10 percent pay cut for six months and a 5 percent cut during
the second six months. After one year, pay would be fully restored.
   Eastern also proposed canceling vacations for the rest of this
year and suspending contributions to a pension fund through 1990.
The concessions would save the company $20 million over 18 months,
Eastern said.
   The airline last week cut pay for senior management and increased
work hours at the same pay for non-union employees. Vacations for
those workers have been canceled for the rest of the year.
   Non-union workers angry over the austerity measures have signed
protest letters to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland and
court-appointed examiner David I. Shapiro.
   The letters complain about a statement last week by Eastern
attorney Harvey Miller that most non-union workers support
management's plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier.
   Gate agent Janet Burgess said 170 employees in Atlanta have
signed the letters, and Vivian Warren, a reservation agent in Tampa,
Fla., said more than 700 workers there have signed.

<HEAD>Airport Screening Catches 93 Percent Of Weapons In Tests</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airport screening is catching a record 93
percent of mock weapons concealed by agents in tests of the system,
according to federal authorities, but airlines still are being fined
for letting some slip through.
   The Federal Aviation Administration announced $1.25 million in
fines Thursday against 28 U.S. airlines, bringing total fines for
security lapses over the past year and a half to $5.2 million.
   A single undetected weapon can cost an airline up to $10,000.
   The most lapses in the latest round of fines were cited against
United Airlines, which would have to pay $167,000 for 23 security
falldowns, the FAA said.
   Continental, Delta, Northwest and Trans World airlines would each
have to pay in excess of $100,000 for 16 or more failures to detect
mock weapons or explosives, the FAA said. Fines against others
ranged down to $1,000 for single violations.
   The fines, which are either $1,000 or $10,000 per violation
depending on the airport checkpoint's overall record, were proposed
in letters sent to the airlines, which can appeal the assessments.
Fines at airports where detection is less than 95 percent are at the
higher rate.
   The FAA does not disclose which airports it checks or where the
security lapses occur.
   In all, the airlines' X-rays, metal detectors or hand searches of
passengers and luggage allegedly failed 179 times in tests since
late last year.
   The FAA said detection has improved steadily under a program of
stepped-up enforcement begun in October 1987. The rate of detection
then was 78.9 percent. It increased to 85.6 percent during the first
six months of 1988, to 88.9 percent in the July-September period,
and to 93 percent in tests conducted up to March 1989, the FAA said.
   Airlines are responsible for screening all passengers and their
carry-on items and are fined for violations even though screening is
sometimes performed by another airline or by a contracted security
agency. Each airline using a screening station when a lapse occurs
is fined.
   The FAA said it ran more than 6,800 checks at U.S. airports last
year. The agency does not conduct testing at foreign airports where
screening is often performed with the direct participation of
governments.
   In addition to United, five airlines were cited for a dozen or
more lapses: Delta, 19 violations for $136,000; Continental, 19 for
$127,000; Northwest, 18 for $99,000; TWA, 16 for $133,000, and
American, 12 for $75,000.
   Other airliens and their violations and fines were:
   Aloha, 2 for $20,000; Alaska, 1 for $10,000; American West, 1 for
$10,000; Atlantic Southwest, 2 for $2,000; Braniff, 6 for $24,000;
Business Express, 5 for $50,000; Eastern, 6 for $51,000; Express, 2
for $11,000; Hawaiian, 5 for $41,000; Midway, 7 for $61,000; Pan Am,
4 for $40,000; Piedmont, 7 for $52,000; Royale, 1 for $10,000;
Skywest, 1 for $10,000; Southwest, 9 for $45,000; USAir, 7 for
$65,000.
   The following airlines received minimal $1,000 fines for single
violations: Britt, CC Air, Comair, Independent, Midwest Express and
Sun Country.

   Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee
say they see little movement toward cutting capital-gains taxes
despite Chairman Dan Rostenkowski's new-found willingness to deal on
the issue with President Bush.
   ``What you are seeing is that Rostenkowski as chairman has to get
a bill (to raise revenues) and he has to find a compromise
somehow,'' said Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, a member of the
tax-writing panel. ``The rest of us don't have that primary
responsibility and we can stick by what we think is good tax law.''
   Although the committee has a solid base of support for a
capital-gains break, Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said Thursday: ``I
don't think the committee is anywhere near making the decision to
cut the capital-gains tax.''
   The new round of talk about a lower tax on capital gains _ which
are profits from the sale of stock and other investments _ was
prompted by Rostenkowski's statement in newspaper interviews that he
would consider a cut if Bush accepted some Democratic proposals for
raising taxes.
   Bush was elected president on an oft-repeated pledge not to raise
taxes and to cut capital-gains taxes. Rostenkowski, an Illinois
Democrat, has been just as adamantly opposed to a capital-gains cut,
calling it a giveaway to the rich.
   According to a Rostenkowski aide, the chairman realizes that
something has to give if his tax-writing committee is to find a
mandated $5.3 billion in new revenues to reduce the deficit in the
budget year that begins Oct. 1.
   ``He doesn't like a lower tax rate for capital gains,'' added the
aide, who spoke only on condition he not be identified by name.
``But could it ever be acceptable? The answer is yes _ if the
president offered in return something so attractive to Democrats
that they couldn't turn it down.''
   Bush insists that cutting capital-gains taxes would raise
government revenues over the long run by boosting investment and job
creation. Congressional Democrats view the idea as a long-term loser.
   But Bush's economists and those who advise Congress agree that a
capital-gains rate cut would raise money during the first year by
encouraging investors to sell some long-held assets.
   So, a popular idea being advanced by lobbyists and discussed by
lawmakers would cut the top capital-gains rate, now 33 percent, to
20 percent for only one year or maybe two. The higher rate would
return but capital gains would be ``indexed'' so that an investor
would not be taxed on profits that were caused solely by inflation.
   In return for those concessions, the theory goes, Bush would go
along with some kind of deficit-reduction revenue boost that the
public would not view as a general tax increase.
   Some Democrats are cool to any capital-gains cut because 80
percent of the benefit would go to those with incomes over $100,000
a year.
   For that reason, some liberal Democrats on Ways and Means prefer
cutting the deficit by requiring more upper-income people to pay the
top income tax rate of 33 percent. Some urban members of the panel
favor a higher gasoline tax. Some want to boost taxes on alcohol and
cigarettes.
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., citing repeal of the capital-gains
tax break and the tax shelters it fostered as a major benefit of the
1986 tax overhaul, said he is not sure he is interested in
restoration of the provision, even to cut the deficit.
   The proposed tradeoff would mortgage the nation's future, he
said. ``A multiyear (capital-gains) reduction would mean we would be
sacrificing future years' revenues for one year of deficit
reduction.''

   The future is now for the American population:
most of the people who will greet the next century already here,
pursuing educations and careers.
   The Americans watching the 20th century grind toward a halt are
far different than their ancestors who greeted the arrival of the
1900s, an era that has seen the population move south and west and
make major shifts in family life, women's status and technology.
   ``Over 80 percent of the people who will make up the population
of the United States in the year 2000 are now alive,'' reports a new
study by the private Population Reference Bureau.
   The ``next century's first high school graduating class, as well
as its drop-outs, are already in grade school; and the elderly of
the 21st century are already well down paths that will determine
their financial and health-care needs for old age,'' the independent
Bureau observed in a study released Thursday: ``America in the 21st
Century: A Demographic Overview.''
   At the same time the Census Bureau issued its ``Population
Profile of the United States 1989,'' looking at the current
population status of the country.
   The aging of America is likely the most discussed and documented
trend, with 29.8 million elderly in the country as of 1987, 12.2
percent of the population, and two-thirds of the group being women,
the Census Bureau reported.
   The agency says the number of elderly will continue growing into
the next century, jumping to one American in five when the massive
post-World War II Baby Boom generation hits senior citizen status by
about the year 2030.
   That will critically affect health care and retirement income
programs, observes the Population Reference Bureau study.
   There will be a relative scarcity of young people to take entry
level jobs, school enrollment could shrink and employers will face a
different mix of potential workers.
   Retraining of older workers may become an economic necessity,
says the private group, and there may become a need to ease
immigration rules to recruit certain skilled people from other
countries.
   The ``traditional'' family makeup of a working husband with a
wife who stays home with the children has long-since changed. In
1987, fewer than half of all families included children. In the
majority of those that did, mothers held jobs outside the home.
   At the same time, Population Reference Bureau noted, ``the
growing incidence of divorce and out-of-wedlock births has fueled an
enormous increase in single-parent families.''
   Currently nearly one in four children lives with only one parent,
compared to one in 10 in 1960, the population group said.
   ``The growing concern over child care, elder care and parental
leave will continue well into next century,'' it concluded.
   Rapidly growing black and Hispanic populations have also
attracted attention in recent years, with the Census Bureau
reporting that blacks now constitute 12.2 percent of Americans while
Hispanics make up 8 percent _ meaning that, although there is some
overlap, these two groups now include nearly one in five Americans.
   ``By 2000 nearly one-third of all school-age children will be
from minority populations _ a situation that presents a major
challenge to our school systems,'' the Population Reference Bureau
reported.

   The Farmers Home Administration says it won't
make public the names of 31 borrowers who have had million-dollar
debts wiped off the books under new federal credit procedures.
   One reason given by FmHA officials is that the agency's
headquarters in the Agriculture Department did not ask field offices
for the identities of the big borrowers when debt restructuring
statistics were compiled.
   Another reason, the agency told The Associated Press in denying a
Freedom of Information request, is that the identities may be
protected under the Privacy Act.
   Aimee Fisher, the FmHA freedom of information officer, said state
offices were asked only for the number of borrowers who had received
write-downs and write-offs of loans. The numbers were broken down
only in ranges of debt by state.
   For example, the 31 borrowers each were included in a category of
debt write-offs of between $1 million and $5 million in 17 states:
   Alabama, 1; Arizona, 1; Florida, 2; Georgia, 1; Idaho, 1;
Indiana, 3; Kentucky, 1; Louisiana, 7; Maine, 1; Michigan, 5;
Mississippi, 1; Missouri, 1; Montana, 1; North Carolina, 1; North
Dakota, 1; Pennsylvania, 2; and Virginia, 1.
   ``Neither the identities of those particular borrowers, nor the
corresponding exact dollar amounts of their write-downs, was
requested,'' Fisher said. ``This information is not compiled and is,
therefore, not considered readily available.''
   In order to gather the information about the 31 million-dollar
write-offs, she said, the FmHA ``would have to canvass every county
office'' in each of the affected states. ``This would constitute an
expensive and very time-consuming search for this agency.''
   The identities of the borrowers ``may be arguably considered
releasable as a matter involving an appropriate accounting of public
funds,'' Fisher said.
   She added: ``However, there is the sound countervailing argument
that these individual borrowers' debt-servicing relationship with
this agency is considered protectable under the Privacy Act inasmuch
as these individuals' private financial situation is necessarily an
integral part of, and is disclosed by identifying, this
relationship.''
   Under the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987, the FmHA was given
greater authority to restructure billions of dollars in delinquent
loans. The procedures include the reduction or write-down of loans
to fit a borrower's ability to repay.
   The law also allows a complete write-off of loans that are
hopeless, where it would cost the agency so much to liquidate
holdings that little or nothing would be left after settling with
banks and other institutions to pay on the FmHA debt.
   At the start of the FmHA restructuring program last fall, more
than $8.4 billion was in arrears. Of that, more than $8.2 billion
was outstanding for more than one year, including $6.6 billion that
had been delinquent for more than four years.
   A new analysis by the department's Economic Research Service said
this week that almost 85 percent of the FmHA's delinquencies last
fall involved non-real estate loans, suggesting virtually no
security backing them.
   ``Many of the reportedly delinquent borrowers have probably quit
farming,'' the report said. ``Over $1.1 billion is reported
delinquent on Economic Emergency loans, a program that has not been
authorized since fiscal 1984.''

   Four retired Agriculture Department scientists
have been named to the Agricultural Research Service's hall of fame.
   R. Dean Plowman, administrator of the USDA science agency, said,
``Landmark research by each of these scientists has advanced
agriculture both at home and abroad.''
   The four scientists, all retired, are:
   _Theodore O. Diener, plant pathologist and research leader,
Microbiology and Plant Pathology Research Laboratory, Beltsville,
Md. He discovered viroids, the smallest known agent of infectious
disease in any organism, about one-eightieth the size of a virus.
   _Douglas R. Dewey, plant geneticist and research leader, Forage
and Range Research Unit, Logan, Utah, internationally acclaimed for
his work to improve forage grasses and grazing lands.
   _Karl Norris, agricultural engineer and research leader,
Instrumentation Research Laboratory, Beltsville, Md., who conceived
and developed a new field of instrument technology using the
infrared part of the spectrum to evaluate the quality of
agricultural products.
   _John F. Sullivan, chemical engineer and research leader, Eastern
Regional Research Center, Philadelphia, Pa., a major force in the
advancement of food processing and storage technologies. He was
senior team member in the development of instant potatoes, and also
was a developer of the ``explosion puffing'' method of producing
dried fruits and vegetables for use in cereals and instant soups.

<TEXT>
   Pennzoil Co. dumped its 8 percent stake in
Burlington Resources Inc., ending speculation it planned to use its
massive $2.6 billion lawsuit settlement to acquire the Seattle-based
company.
   Ever since the Houston-based oil company received the settlement
from Texaco Inc. last year, it has been watched closely for any sign
it may be honing in on takeover targets.
   Pennzoil officials said Thursday the company sold 11.7 million
Burlington shares to Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a single trade.
The company sold the stock for $45.25 a share, or about $530 million.
   Pennzoil spokesman Robert Harper said the company had sold an
additional 261,000 Burlington shares in the open market in the
preceeding days.
   Pennzoil said its pretax gain on the investment amounts to
approximately $134 million. Harper said it had not been decided how
the money would be used.
   ``There is a good deal of speculation concerning how we plan to
invest the proceeds from our settlement of litigation with Texaco,
and we have refused to comment on that,'' he said.
   ``But in every filing we made with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, we stated that we were making that (Burlington stock
purchase) for investment purposes,'' Harper said.
   Burlington filed a complaint in federal court in February
alleging that Pennzoil misstated its intentions and was amassing
stock in the resource-rich company in a veiled takeover attempt.
   The complaint asked the court to make Pennzoil fully disclose its
intentions, restrict its acquisition of Burlington stock and divest
most of the stock already bought.
   Harper said Thursday that Pennzoil would not comment on the
Burlington action or its relationship to the stock divestiture.
   Pennzoil received the multibillion-dollar settlement from Texaco
to resolve litigation over Texaco's 1985 acquisition of Getty Oil Co.

   Stock prices were little changed at midday Friday
as the market awaited the release of the U.S. producer price index.
   Dealers said the market was anxious to see if progress was being
made against U.S. inflation. A smaller-than-expected rise in the
index, due to be released later Friday, would help confirm the
opinion that inflation is peaking and foster anticipation that the
U.S. Federal Reserve might move to lower interest rates.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Sock Exchange 100-share index
stood at 2,145.7, up 2.3 points but off its morning high of 2,154.3.

<HEAD>Prime Computer Directors Meet With Hostile Bidder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time since he launched his hostile
bid for Prime Computer Inc. last fall, Bennett S. LeBow held a
face-to-face meeting with Prime's top executives this week.
   But instead of smoothing things over, the session appears to have
created more bitterness.
   In a statement Thursday, LeBow said Prime's directors showed ``no
interest in negotiating'' a merger and refused to give him the same
confidential financial information they have provided to other
potential buyers.
   Prime shot back by accusing LeBow, chairman of MAI Basic Four
Inc. of Tustin, Calif., of ``grossly misrepresenting'' what happened
at the meeting Wednesday morning and of using bait-and-switch
tactics to try to buy the company at a low price.
   Last week, LeBow cut his offer for Prime, a Natick-based computer
manufacturer with 11,200 employees and 1988 revenues of $1.6 billion.
   Since Nov. 15, MAI had offered $20 a share for all of Prime's
stock. Now, it is offering $19.50 a share for about 75 percent of
the shares and suggesting a swap of securities with a face value of
$21 a share for the remaining 25 percent.
   Since the securities are likely to trade at less than face value,
many Wall Street analysts are valuing the new offer at $17 to $19 a
share.
   Jay Stevens, who follows Prime for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
New York, said Thursday the new bid totaled about $1.05 billion,
down from an original offer of about $1.25 billion.
   Prime President Anthony Craig said the company's three-member
executive committee entered Wednesday's meeting with LeBow ``in good
faith, without lawyers or other advisers, and totally willing to
enter into meaningful discussions.''
   He also said Prime gave LeBow and his partner, William Weksel,
the same financial information it has given other possible bidders.
   ``To have MAI represent us as `showing no interest in
negotiating' is simply a gross misstatement,'' he said.
   ``We feel strongly that MAI is engaging in unfair tactics, and we
do not believe they should be allowed to bait our shareholders for
nearly six months with an all-cash, $20-per-share offer for all
Prime shares, and then switch to a lower, two-tier offer of less
cash and securities of very questionable value,'' Craig said.
   LeBow has said he lowered his bid because Prime's revenue
projections went down. And he has reaffirmed his intention to wage a
proxy fight for control of the company at its annual meeting.
   MAI also has filed a lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court to try to
compel Prime to hold the annual meeting June 14, as previously
scheduled. Prime announced this week it was rescheduling the meeting
to July 26. A hearing on the lawsuit is scheduled for Monday
afternoon.

   American Airline Inc.'s commuter airline
sister said has purchased 25 aircraft from British Aerospace PLC
with options for up to 75 more planes in a deal industry sources
valued at just under $500 million.
   AMR Eagle Inc. said Thursday it purchased 25 Jetstream Super 31
aircraft and has options for up to 25 more of the 19-seatplanes and
up to 50 29-seat Jetstream 41s.
   AMR Eagle did not put a value on the deal but said in a statement
that it involved ``a minimum capital commitment on AMR's part and
included very attractive terms.'' Industry sources valued the
transaction at just under $500 million.
   AMR Eagle is based in Fort Worth. British Aerospace is based in
London. Both AMR Eagle and American Airlines are wholly owned
subsidiaries of AMR Corp., which also is based in Fort Worth.
   Two weeks ago, AMR Eagle announced it would buy up to 150
Swedish-made Saab commuter aircraft.
   The airline is ordering a mix of aircraft to meet the specific

   Apple Computer Inc. executives promised
to prosecute anyone captured from a group of ideological software
pirates that claims to have liberated the Macintosh computer's
ultra-secret code.
   ``This is a serious criminal offense,'' said Apple spokeswoman
Carleen LeVasseur on Thursday. The company has alerted all of its
workers, but she acknowledged that the group could include some
Apple employees.
   ``(The code) is the basis of our intellectual property,'' she
said of the closely-guarded copyright code.
   ``We are also alerting our (software) developers that they could
jeopardize their relationship with the us if they use any of the
proprietary codes,'' said LeVasseur.
   The disk was mailed illegally by the group to various people and
was accompanied by a letter signed, ``the New Prometheus League
(Software Artists for Information Dissemination).'' It stated:
   ``Our objective at Apple is to distribute everything that
prevents other manufacturers from creating legal copies of the
Macintosh.
   ``As an organization the New Prometheus League has no ambition
beyond seeing the genius of a few Apple employees benefit the entire
world ... (and) not just dissipated by Apple through litigation and
ill will.''
   Unlike some other computer makers, Apple has never licensed its
source code to anyone and has aggressively and successfully defended
its copyrights in court to prevent competitors from building a
``clone'' of the Macintosh.
   The letter also said the group plans to distribute the complete
source code to the Macintosh's filing system and all drives, as well
as codes to the computer's memory and latest system software.
   The group is named for the Greek Titan who stole fire from heaven
and gave it to man. Prometheus was later chained and tortured by
Zeus for the theft.
   The disks were mailed from San Francisco without a return
address. Apple said it first became aware of them on Tuesday.
   The letter advises that ``anyone interested in receiving our next
mailing should place a classified ad in Macweek (a trade journal),
with the word New Prometheus.''

<HEAD>Alaska Suspends Oil Lease Program</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's natural resources commissioner
has suspended the state's oil and leasing program, but said the
decision was only indirectly a response to public outcry over the
March 24 Exxon oil spill.
   Commissioner Lennie Gorsuch said a shrinking budget and a
burgeoning workload were the reasons behind Thursday's action. The
suspension postpones five sales totaling 2.3 million acres.
   ``It would be irresponsible to lease new oil and gas areas, and
then not have adequate funding to meet our commitments to the oil
producers who have already bought leases from the state, drilled
exploratory wells and made discoveries,'' she said.
   The leasing program, which dates back to statehood in 1959, has
generated more than $763 million for the state over the past 10
years and offered more than 12 million acres to oil companies for
exploration and development.
   Lease sales provide the petroleum industry with the base for
future discoveries that help to replenish reserves. The state reaps
taxes and royalties from oil production.
   Gorsuch said the governor supported the action and that it was
not directly related to the 10.9 million-gallon spill in Prince
William Sound. ``We just had to make some tough decisions about what
needs to be done and what programs could be set aside until there is
more funding,'' she said.
   Jim Eason, director of Alaska Division of Oil &amp; Gas, said the
lease program will remain on hold until the Legislature, which
convenes in January, appropriates enough money to hire staff to
handle the increasing workload.
   Since 1985, the division's budget has been cut about $1 million,
he said, and staff effectively has been reduced from 67 to 44.
   Eason said the immediate effect of the suspension of the program
is the postponement of five lease sales scheduled for this year and
the first half of 1990 _ two in the Cook Inlet area and three on the
North Slope.
   Eason also said the suspension of the program was not directly
related to the oil spill, but the spill raised public concern over
oil and gas development in Alaska.
   He said he is optimistic the leasing program will resume in the
future.
   In addition to conducting lease sales, the division collects the
state's oil royalties and lease rentals, issues permits for
development and geophysical exploration and handles contracts for
the state's royalty oil.

   The stock market gave ground today, faced with
news of a bigger-than-expected increase in producer prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.80 to 2,510.11
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 389 up, 529 down and
549 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 30.37 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.9 percent in May, substantially outpacing
advance estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   Analysts said the news dampened hopes that the Federal Reserve
would continue any time soon with what looked in recent days like
the start of a move to relax its credit policy.
   Nevertheless, some observers said they were impressed with the
market's relatively calm reaction to the news.
   Unexpected jumps in the producer price index earlier this year
touched off sharp declines in stock prices.

<HEAD>EEC Adopts U.S. Car Pollution Standards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under growing pressure from ecologists, the
European Community Friday adopted U.S. pollution standards _ the
world's lowest _ for small cars.
   The standards, approved by the 12 EEC environment ministers, will
become compulsory throughout the European Economic Community on July
1, 1992 for new models and on Dec. 12, 1992 for old models.
   The standards were set at 19 grams a test for carbon monoxide and
5 grams a test for hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxide.
   Meanwhile, however, EEC members willing to offer tax rebates to
buyers of clean cars will be allowed to do so, provided the tax cut
is substantially lower than the added cost of the car's
pollution-free device, the ministers decided.
   An EEC official explained that the tax rebates would have to be
15 to 20 percent lower than the added cost of the car's
pollution-reducing device.
   The decision to lower standards for small cars followed growing
pressure from the public.
   Several governments, fearing new gains by green parties in their
national elections and European Parliament elections next week, were
pressing the EEC to adopt stricter standards. The European
Parliament added to the pressure by calling for lower pollution
norms.
   The Netherlands was the first to announce tax rebates for clean
cars six months ago, which angered the EEC's policy-making body,
which filed a lawsuit charging that the Dutch incentive distorted
competition within the EEC.
   But Germany, Denmark and Greece also announced tax rebates,
forcing the commission to revise its opposition to the measure.
   The EEC adopted pollution limits for medium and large cars four
years ago.

<HEAD>Reactor Cooled Down, Faulty Valves Sent Back to Manufacturer</HEAD>

   Three faulty safety valves at Seabrook
nuclear plant have been returned to the manufacturer, futher
delaying the start of tests, a plant spokesman said today.
   Operators of the $6 billion reactor, completed nearly three years
ago but unlicensed for low-power tests until last month, had hoped
to start the first fission reaction several days ago but say they
now won't be able to do so before at least the middle of next week.
   Engineers had worked on the valves since last Friday when it was
discovered that one of three in the auxiliary emergency feedwater
system was opening too quickly.
   Plant officials decided Thursday to send all three valves back to
the manufacturer for more repairs, Seabrook spokesman Ron Sher said
this morning by telephone from the plant.
   To remove the valves, Seabrook operators had to bring the reactor
down from its normal operating temperature and pressure, Sher said.
He said the temperature was down to 360 degrees this morning from
557 degrees.
   Once the valves are reinstalled, Sher estimated it would take two
days to get the reactor back to normal operating temperature and
pressure.
   After they are tested and found to work properly, it could take
as long as three days to trigger the first atomic chain reaction in
Seabrook's 100 tons of uranium fuel.
   ``Everything has worked properly except those three valves,''
Sher said.
   Seabrook, originally planned for commercial operation in 1979,
has faced repeated regulatory delays, cost overruns and protests
that have made it a symbol for the nation's anti-nuclear movement.
   Plant officials hope to win a commercial license by the end of
this year, though evacuation-planning and financial problems could
stand in the way.

   The stock market declined slightly today, faced

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.49 to 2,513.42
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading

<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. said will offer a double-coupon
promotion on Saturday in all of its 2,200 discount stores in an
effort to lure shoppers and boost sagging profits.
   K mart normally accepts manufacturers' coupons at face value. On
Saturday, refunds from coupons valued at up to 50 cents will be
doubled, said Teri Kula, senior marketing coordinator.
   K mart, the nation's second-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck
and Co., is tapping the marketing strategy more commonly used in the
supermarket industry to try to boost sales after a 22 percent drop
in its first-quarter profits.
   Double couponing is an expensive promotion because the retailer
must absorb the cost of the extra discount.
   ``It indicates ... their traffic is off and they need people to
swing in those doors again,'' said marketing consultant Frederick
Marx in Bloomfield Hills.
   ``It's unusual,'' K Mart's Kula acknowledged. ``It's being done
to stimulate added sales.''
   K Mart has tried double couponing in selected local markets but
never before on a national scale.
   ``There's no getting around the fact that it's an extremely
competitive environment. Retailers need to do what they can to get
people into the stores,'' Kula said. ``It indicates we're
maintaining our competitive stance in the marketplace.''

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Rebound in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened higher this
morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat prices were strong in early trading, reacting to a
statement about China made by President Bush during Thursday's news
conference. The president said he did not want to cut grain sales to
China despite this week's brutal suppression of student
demonstrators.
   Wheat prices also are reacting to weekend weather forecasts
calling for heavy rain in winter wheat crop areas, said Jon Horton,
an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. The rain is
expected to interfere with harvesting.
   Soybean futures are being affected by the large stocks of
soybeans, primarily in South America. However, prices are being
helped by the relunctance of Brazilian farmers to market their crops
at current price levels.
   At the opening, wheat was 1} cents to 4} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.86 a bushel; corn was a \ cent
to 1 cent higher with July at $2.54\ a bushel; oats were a \ cent to
a { cent higher with July at $1.65{ a bushel; soybeans were 4{ cents
lower to 3{ cents higher with July at $7.09{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .23 cent higher with June at
69.55 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .55 cent
higher with August at 79.50 a pound; hogs were .10 cent lower to .13
cent higher with June at 48.20 a pound; frozen pork bellies were .08
cent to .25 cent higher with July at 32.42 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed Thursday.

<HEAD>`Bargain Hunters' Can Get Burned in Depressed Bank Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For investors who seek opportunities in depressed
investments, the ranks of the nation's troubled banks and savings
institutions might seem a natural prospecting ground.
   There they sit, stocks and bonds of numerous financial
institutions, selling at distress prices. Surely, one might suppose,
some of these securities will sooner or later be worth far more than
they are today.
   Look at what the ``smart money'' is doing _ the prominent
financiers scooping up the remnants of failed banks and savings and
loans.
   Maybe these big-time operators will indeed make money, says one
analyst who specializes in depressed investments, but small
investors should resist the temptation to speculate in battered
banks.
   ``Often a `crisis' is really an investment opportunity in
disguise,'' says George Putnam III, editor of the Boston-based
Turnaround Letter. ``In this case, however, we think that most
investors should steer clear of troubled banks and S&amp;Ls.
   ``Troubled banks are not like other kinds of troubled companies.
When most companies get into trouble, creditors and stockholders
negotiate.
   ``Then, if things get really bad, the company goes into Chapter
11, and creditors and stockholders negotiate some more _ this time
with the help of a bankruptcy judge.''
   By contrast, he observes, ``when a bank gets into trouble,
federal regulators step in and there is no negotiating.''
   When the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or the Federal Savings
and Loan Insurance Corp. takes up the case of a troubled
institution, Putnam says, ``shareholders almost always get wiped out.
   ``Recently bondholders have been getting wiped out as well. The
theory appears to be that when the government has to come in to
rescue depositors, no one else should get anything.''
   In a typical bank case, of course, the depositors have the claim
of a government guarantee _ federal deposit insurance on up to
$100,000 per account _going for them.
   If this assurance were ever to be compromised, it would logically
have far-reaching and disastrous financial effects.
   One trap awaiting the unwary speculator, Putnam says, is the
simple allure of a very low price _ say, a stock that might have
traded once for $30 or $40 a share now going for $2, $1 or less.
   ``Some people think, `How much lower can these stocks go?' The
answer, at least on a percentage basis, is a lot,'' Putnam says.
   To prove his point, he charted the performance of five prominent
bank and savings and loan stocks from three months before the time
they were seized by federal regulators.
   All five issues were already trading below $2 at the starting
point, and their problems were well known to investors. Yet in the
span since then, three have fallen more than 90 percent in price,
while the other two show losses of 70 percent and 30 percent.
   Concluded Putnam, ``we think the only time to buy the securities
of a troubled bank or savings institution is after the federal
regulators have departed. This usually means after a restructuring
has been completed.''

<HEAD>NASD Plans Pre-Dawn Stock Trading; Aiming For Global Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers
said Friday it plans to begin trading 200 to 300 over-the-counter
stocks at 4 a.m. Eastern time, with some of the trading directly
competing with the London Stock Exchange.
   The trading would involve the most active stocks traded on the
NASDAQ computerized system and mark another push toward 24-hour
global securities trading.
   NASD President John Hardiman told the Wall Street Journal in
Friday's editions that the pre-dawn trading was expected to begin in
the first quarter of 1990 but plans for the system have not been
completed.
   The new system would mean trading from 4 a.m. to 4 p.m. in New
York and 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. in London. The U.S. over-the-counter
market and major stock exchanges now trade from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
Eastern time.
   The NASD is the self-regulatory agency that oversees the national
over-the-counter market, which does not have a centralized exchange
or trading floor.
   The OTC's 5,100 stocks, which include many small issues, are
traded electronically over the NASDAQ system, the nation's second
largest behind the New York Stock Exchange.
   According to the Journal report, 71 stocks are traded on both the
London exchange and over the counter in the United States.
   Among the issues slated for pre-dawn trading are all 97 European
stocks listed on the NASDAQ computerized exchange, including Jaguar
PLC, Cadbury Schweppes PLC and Volvo AB. The plan would include such
U.S stocks as Apple Computer Inc., Intel Corp. and MCI
Communications Corp.
   ``We are identifying companies that have true international
interest,'' Hardiman told the Journal.
   He said member firm response will determine whether the plan goes
through.
   ``We aren't 100 percent sure, but there is a strong likelihood
that we'll go ahead,'' Hardiman said.
   About two dozen NASDAQ member firms have offices in London.
   The NASD plan was approved by the association's board last month.
The NASD plans to submit a formal proposal to the Securities and
Exchange Commission in 30 to 60 days. The plan has not yet been
formally announced.
   Later this year, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plans to begin
futures contracts trading after normal trading hours and is
discussing a link with the rival Chicago Board of Trade.
   The New York Stock Exchange also has said it is considering
trading its stocks electronically when the floor is closed.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Illegal Wire Transfer Plot Nearly Netted $69 Million</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of men using high-tech methods of
transferring money nearly heisted more than $69 million from a
Chicago bank, a prosecutor said at the opening of their trial.
   ``This isn't a story like Bonnie and Clyde,'' Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jeffrey Stone said Thursday as the frand trial of five men
opened in federal court. ``Instead of guns, they used telephones.
Instead of masks, they used computers. Instead of a getaway car,
they used foreign bank accounts.''
   Defendants Armand Moore, Neal Jackson, Leonard Strickland, Ronald
Carson and Otis Wilson are charged with conspiracy, wire fraud and
bank fraud in the case.
   Two others, Herschel Bailey and Gabriel Taylor, pleaded guilty to
conspiracy and wire fraud and have agreed to cooperate with the
prosecution.
   Paul Wagner, Moore's attorney, said in his opening statement
Thursday that testimony by Bailey and Taylor is suspect because the
two have an interest in cooperating with the prosecution.
   The plot began in March 1988, when Moore asked Bailey, his
cousin, if he knew anyone who worked at a bank, Stone said. Bailey
put Moore in touch with Wilson, who worked at the First National
Bank of Chicago, Stone said.
   Wilson then set up a meeting between the others and Taylor, who
worked in the wire transfer department at the bank, Stone said.
   Shortly after the bank opened May 13, 1988, the group transferred
$69.12 million from First National to accounts in New York, and then
to two banks in Vienna, Stone said.
   According to Stone, Taylor's job was to verify whether wire
transfers taken over the phone were authorized. Bailey, posing as a
representative of Merrill Lynch and Co., telephoned in a request for
a transfer of $24.37 million.
   Taylor then called Bailey back at his Chicago home to make it
appear he was verifying the order, the prosecutor said. When it
looked as if that transfer had worked, the group transferred $19.75
million from Brown-Forman Corp. and $25 million from United Airlines.
   The transfers went undetected until the following Monday morning,
when the three companies called the bank to find what had happened
to their money. After the plot was discovered, the money was
returned to the Chicago bank.
   When bank officials checked phone records, they found that the
verification calls had been made to Bailey's home, Stone said,
adding that ``every criminal makes a mistake.''

   The 757 passenger models for the Ethiopian flag carrier will seat
156 passengers. The airline will use them mainly to replace 727
jetliners on regional routes, but the planes also will be equipped
for long-range operations, Boeing said.
   The new order brings to 564 the total number of 757s ordered from
Boeing.
   In a separate announcement at the Paris Air Show, Great China
Airlines announced the purchase of four Dash 8 Series 300 planes
from Boeing Canada's de Havilland division.
   The deal is valued at about $52 million. The planes will seat 52

<HEAD>ESOPs Get Boost From IRS Bond Ruling _ But Maybe Not For Long</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Employee stock ownership plans have mushroomed
this year, reflecting efforts by companies to put stock in friendly
hands as a takeover defense. Now a government ruling may make ESOPs
even more common.
   That is, unless U.S. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski gets his way.
   Two weeks ago, the Internal Revenue Service clarified its rules
about how companies may raise cash to buy the stock that is placed
in the employee stock plans, which act as trusts to manage the
employees' shares.
   Previously, companies were limited to private borrowings, such as
loans or notes from banks, insurance companies and other
institutions. The IRS ruling now makes it practical for companies
for the first time to sell publicly traded bonds to raise the funds
needed to purchase stock for ESOPs.
   But days after the IRS ruling, Rostenkowski, chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, introduced a bill to eliminate a tax
break now enjoyed by institutions that loan money for ESOPs.
   These institutions don't have to pay taxes on half the interest
they earn from the loans. In addition, a company establishing an
ESOP enjoys a tax break of its own: It may deduct from its taxes
both the principal and interest payments on these loans.
   Rostenkowski says he believes some companies are borrowing money
for ESOPs purely for the tax benefits. His bill would eliminate the
50 percent tax deduction for institutions making ESOP loans.
   The ESOP Association, a Washington-based lobbying group, says the
bill could severely damage ESOP funding should it be enacted. In
effect, it would increase the cost of borrowing for ESOPs, since the
loaning institutions would have to charge a higher rate of interest
if they no longer had the tax break.
   ``There are companies where the difference between the current
rate and the higher rate they would have to pay would be enough to
scotch the (ESOP) deal,'' said Martin Staubus, the group's associate
director.
   In addition, the bill could lower the amount of money available
at each company to buy stock for ESOPS, he said. Under the federal
law that established the stock plans, companies must limit the
amount of money they spend on ESOP stock to 25 percent of the
payroll of the employees covered by the plan. If the interest costs
on ESOP loans increase, that would limit the amount of principal
available for stock purchases.
   The ESOP Association says it believes Rostenkowski is wrong to
criticize the tax breaks available in forming employee-stock plans.
   The ESOP law, Staubus said, ``has been effective in doing just
what it was intended to do, which is for companies to provide an
ownership stake to their employees. Regardless whether companies see
some benefits to themselves, that point isn't especially pertinent.''
   The effect of the IRS ruling, if not circumvented by
Rostenkowski's bill, is not clear.
   What the ruling did was to clarify that ESOP debt doesn't lose
its tax advantages for lending institutions if sold to an
individual, then sold again to an institution.
   In effect, it sanctions public trading of ESOP bonds; before the
ruling, companies issuing ESOP debt were unsure whether the debt
would lose the tax break if it were traded.
   But the ruling does not allow individuals to exploit the tax
break; only qualified lending institutions may do so.
   Staubus says the ruling probably wouldn't result in any major
overall increase in ESOP borrowing. Instead, it might produce a
shift in the borrowing from the private-placement debt market to the
public bond market.
   But others are more optimistic.
   ``I think that it's a significant ruling'' that will lead to
substantial public funding of ESOPs, said Ross Stemer, director of
investor relations at Brunswick Corp.
   The leisure products manufacturer, which is establishing an ESOP,
planned to be one of the first companies to issue public debt to
finance an ESOP whether or not the IRS made its ruling.
   Publicly traded bonds could lead to lower-cost ESOP funding, and
possibly even mutual funds based on ESOP debt. A Salomon Brothers
Inc. vice president has estimated the potential public ESOP debt
market at $20 billion to $30 billion.

   Who owns American business?
   Amid the wheeling and dealing of corporate managements these days
you might think they're the owners, but it isn't so. Shareholders
still own America's public corporations, although you may be
forgiven for forgetting this fact.
   Sometimes managements seem to forget, too. In its effort to sell
the company to itself, the management of RJR Nabisco Inc. was at
first willing to accept $8 billion less than what became the final
price.
   The additional money was put on the table when competitors for
the company offered shareholders a deal the RJR Nabisco board
couldn't refuse, roughly $25 billion versus an initial price of
about $17 billion.
   Compelled by law to attend to shareholder interests, the RJR
Nabisco board would have had a difficult time rationalizing the
lower price, although important considerations other than price
could have entered the picture.
   It is roughly the same situation that the board of Time Inc. must
deal with. In a management-proposed deal with Warner Communications,
Time shares might have been worth about $125. Paramount
Communications Inc., formerly Gulf &amp; Western, offered $175 a share.
   In making the latter offer, Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis
recognized an essential truth, that in the final analysis it is
shareholders looking after their own interests who call the shots.
   It is usually not so in day-to-day affairs; shareholders simply
aren't consulted. And in long-term matters they seldom have a real
opportunity to oppose or educate management.
   For the most part, it is generally acknowledged that shareholders
exercise their rights as owners by buying and selling. If they
disagree with management they sell; if they approve, they hold their
shares or buy more.
   But when well-financed suitors seek control of a company with a
high cash offer, shareholders have their say, if not directly
through tendering their shares, then through the action of their
representative, the board.
   Still, the highest price isn't always the best one, a situation
that it seems safe to say is recognized by most shareholders.
   Some suitors, for example, seek a company simply to break it up
and sell off the parts. Short-term, this might benefit shareholders;
long term it might not, since further price appreciation and
dividends come to a sudden stop.
   Others, too, have a say in a corporation's fate, including
employees, the local communities to which it pays taxes, customers
dependent on its products and, for reasons of market competition or
national security, Uncle Sam.
   In the battle for Time Inc., the national security issue could
emerge over concern for a free press. Basic to this issue is a
belief that a free flow of information is necessary for the proper
operation of any large democracy.
   Viewed in that context, any entry into the battle by a foreign
suitor or by a party interested in dismembering Time Inc., a
journalistic giant whose magazines are American institutions, might
set off a serious debate.
   In making Paramount's $175 offer for Time, Davis took careful
note of this factor, promising that if successful, ``We would not
only protect Time's journalistic independence, we would insist on
it...''
   Money talks in takeover battles. It talks loudly and often
conclusively, but not so loudly that other considerations aren't
heard, especially if they are colored by patriotic or national
security concerns.

<HEAD>U.S., Japan To Study Increasing Semiconductor Access</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese and U.S. semiconductor industry officials
have agreed to meet on seeking better access for foreign companies
to the Japanese semiconductor market, a Japanese official said
Friday.
   The Electronic Industries Association of Japan and the U.S.
Semiconductor Industries Association decided Thursday to create a
task force to improve links between foreign suppliers and Japanese
companies that purchase semiconductors.
   EIAJ Chairman Toori Sato said the panel would contain five
Japanese companies, including Sony Corp. and Matsushita Electric
Co., and a group of American companies to be designated by the SIA.
   The task force is to discuss how foreign producers can better
meet the requirements of Japanese purchasers, and will exchange
technical information, Sato said. Its first meeting is expected in
mid-July.
   The EIAJ also proposed forming another group to search for ways
of encouraging foreign suppliers to participate in Japan's high
definition television _ HDTV _ industry.
   Sato said the proposal was made ``in response to repeated
expressions of interest by U.S. producers in gaining greater access
to the HDTV semiconductor market.''
   The American side said it respond later to the proposal, he said.
   Earlier this week, SIA representatives told government officials
they were dissatisfied with the current 10.9 percent U.S. share of
the Japanese semiconductor market, a Ministry of International Trade
official said.
   Some U.S. officials have claimed Japan pledged in a 1986
bilateral semiconductor pact to allow foreign chipmakers 20 percent
of the Japanese market, but Japanese officials have said that figure
was only a goal.
   ``...(W)hat we would like to do is to offer more accessibility by
creating closer ties between electronic manufacturers and foreign
semiconductor makers starting from the product-planning stage,'' the
government official said.
   A U.S. electronics industry source said Japan should have taken
stronger steps earlier to open its semiconductor market, but the
agreement Thursday was positive.

   Prices on London's stock exchange recovered to end
mixed Friday after a sharp rise in U.S. producer prices pushed the
market lower.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 1.3
points, or 0.06 percent, at 2,142.1. It lost as much as 10.2 points
earlier in the day.
   Volume fell to a moderate 528.2 million shares.
   The news that U.S. producer prices rose 0.9 percent in May, more
than double the market's expectations, dampened hopes of an imminent
easing of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The report
came against a background of recent worries that British rates might
be forced higher.
   ``This market depends very much on the outlook for interest
rates, which depends very much on sterling,'' one London dealer said.
   Shares were able to bounce back toward the close as the pound
held steady against the Deutsche mark and as Wall Street showed only
modest losses following the U.S. statistics.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mylan Laboratories Inc. has filed suit against
four of its competitors, alleging they damaged its business by
bribing federal officials for preferential treatment in the generic
drug business.
   The suit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Washington,
D.C., claimed the competitors violated federal antitrust and
racketeering laws resulting in about $200 million in damage.
   The suit comes in the wake of a Food and Drug Administration
investigation and the filing of criminal indictments last month
against two FDA officials and two pharmaceutical company executives.
   The FDA officials and the executives have all either pleaded
guilty to criminal charges or agreed to plead guilty, according to
the U.S. Attorney's Office in Baltimore.
   Mylan claims it was thwarted in its efforts to bring 22 generic
products to market in a timely fashion because of corruption in the
approval process beginning in 1984, when a federal law regulating
generic drugs took effect.
   The suit describes the generic drug industry's highly competitive
nature, in which getting products on pharmacy shelves first is of
paramount importance.
   It contends that competing companies and executives ``embarked on
a scheme of unlawfully giving cash, gifts of furniture, electronic
equipment and other valuable items, trips to the Far East and other
exotic places and payments for hotel rooms and entertainment in
expensive bars and restaurants'' to FDA officials.
   At the same time, ``Mylan began experiencing unwarranted and
unjustified delays in obtaining FDA approvals'' of its applications
for generic drugs, the suit said.
   The competitors named in the suit include AKZO NV, a Dutch
concern; Par Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Spring Valley, N.Y.; Vitarine
Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Springfield Gardens, N.Y.; and American
Therapeutics Inc. of Bohemia, N.Y.
   Also named were various officers, employees and agents of those
firms and an AKZO subsidiary, Pharmaceutical Basics Inc., and a
subsidiary of Par, Quad Pharmaceuticals Inc.
   ``What we're saying is that the payment of bribes in order to
change the way the regulatory process functioned resulted in earlier
approvals'' of drugs for Mylan's competitors, said Mike Forscey, a
Washington-based attorney for Mylan.
   Greg Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher &amp; Singer Inc. in
Pittsburgh, said that even at $200 million, damages would be worth
$5.55 per share to Mylan, an amount he estimated would be equal to
the company's pre-tax profits for the past 13 years.
   Determining damages for lost business oportunities has proven
difficult in other suits, he noted.
   Par spokeswoman Barbara Manners said the company will
``vigorously defend itself'' but declined to respond to the specific
charges.
   Officials of AKZO and Vitarine declined comment.

   The stock market showed a small loss today, faced
with news of a bigger-than-expected increase in producer prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.86 to 2,513.05
by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 614 up, 792 down and
523 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.9 percent in May, substantially outpacing
advance estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   Analysts said the news dampened hopes that the Federal Reserve
would continue any time soon with what looked in recent days like
the start of a move to relax its credit policy.
   Nevertheless, some observers said they were impressed with the
market's relatively calm reaction to the news.
   Unexpected jumps in the producer price index earlier this year
touched off sharp declines in stock prices.
   The blow apparently was cushioned this time by several factors,
including continued strength of the dollar in foreign exchange and a
strong bond market.
   Yields on long-term government bonds, which were above 9 percent
less than three months ago, fell below 8.2 percent in today's
trading.
   USX led the active list, up 1[ at 38[ on renewed speculation that
financier Carl Icahn, who has a large stake in the company, might be
planning a takeover or some other transaction.
   Losers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down [ at 36[; International Business Machines, down | at
108|, and General Electric, down [ at 54].
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .24 to 182.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .20 at 365.80.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 129.09 million shares with two

<HEAD>Prudential-Bache Realigns Structure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said Friday it
is reorganizing its investment and merchant banking operations in an
effort to enhance client service and increase the firm's competitive
clout.
   Loren Schechter, executive vice president corporate services,
said the reorganization involves changes in the chain of command and
will affect less than a quarter of the 2,000 employees in
Prudential-Bache's institutional investment and merchant banking arm.
   No employees in the division, called Prudential-Bache Capital
Funding, will be laid off or be required to make significant
relocations, he said.
   Prudential-Bache, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. of
America, has a total of about 17,000 employees.
   ``This is not part of a massive reduction in staff,'' said
Schechter.
   An internal memorandum distributed to staff and made available to
the Associated Press on Friday described a series of structural
changes that deal with shifts in management oversight of units
within the capital funding arm and other organizational realignments.
   Schechter said the changes are intended to streamline the
businesses, making them easier to run and more responsive to
customers' needs.
   ``We're very pleased with how the bank has been running,''
Schechter said. ``This is the next stage of development, to make it
run better.''
   George L. Ball, Prudential-Bache's chairman and chief executive
officer, stated in a written summary of the memo that ``in market
share, profitability and reputation, the firm accomplished an
enormous amount in both capital markets and investment-merchant
banking.''
   The organizational changes are ``designed to bring together sets
of skills and responsibilities, not to shuffle people or power,'' he
added.
   The eight-page staff memo used mostly upbeat language to portrary
Pru-Bache's achievements.
   But, in explaining the reasons for the reorganization, to be
carried out over the next few weeks, the memo listed several
difficult market conditions. The volume of business in several
categories is shrinking at a time when the number of competitors for
that business is expanding, it said.
   At most firms, investment bankers, traders, researchers and sales
people are in different divisions and may have different, perhaps
conflicting, priorities, the memo said.
   The reorganization is aimed at overcoming this structural
disadvantage by grouping together employees pertinent to particular
types of transactions in the same reporting area, something Ball
termed ``transactional integration.''
   The reorganization has been planned for months, according to
Schechter, and wasn't triggered by the firm's loss of $9 million in
the first quarter. He declined to speculate on the firm's current
financial performance. Prudential-Bache earned a record $111 million
last year.
   Wall Street analysts have criticized Pru-Bache for being slow in
building up its muscle in the merchant and investment banking
business.
   According to first-quarter figures compiled by Securities Data
Corp., Pru-Bache ranked ninth among underwriters of U.S. debt and
equity securities and managed $2.7 billion of offerings or 3.9
percent of the market. By contrast, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the
industry leader, managed $13.7 billion, or 19.7 percent of the
market.
   Separately, Pru-Bache spokeswoman Eleanor E. Mascheroni declined
to comment Friday on a published report that the firm has been
discussing the purchase of Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   The New York Times said Pru-Bache is in the final stages of
negotiations to acquire Thomson McKinnon, which has been hunting for
new capital for months. A deal is expected to be announced in the
next few weeks, the newspaper said.
   Thomson McKinnon, a unit of the privately-held Thomson McKinnon
Inc. with about 5,200 employees, initially tried to find an investor
for the 23 percent stake owned by the Hartford Accident and
Indemnity Co.
   Howard Cohen, spokesman for Thomson McKinnon, also declined to
comment on the report.

<HEAD>Storehouse Rejects $1.2 Billion Proposal from Edelman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Storehouse PLC on Friday rejected a proposal by
U.S. takeover specialist Asher Edelman that he make a friendly offer
for the British retailer of 760 million pounds, or about $1.2
billion.
   Edelman said he was prepared to offer 185 pence, or $2.89, a
share for Storehouse, subject to several conditions including
approval by Storehouse's board of directors.
   But Storehouse said it wouldn't meet with Edelman to discuss his
proposal, saying his approach ``is neither an offer nor a firm
intention to make an offer.''
   On the London Stock Exchange Friday, Storehouse shares jumped 8
pence, or 12 cents, to finish at 162 pence, or $2.53 _ 23 pence
below the offer price suggested by Edelman.
   Storehouse operates a total of about 900 stores on both sides of
the Atlantic under the names Habitat, Conran's, Mothercare and BHS
(British Home Stores).
   Edelman already owns around 33 million Storehouse shares, or 8.1
percent of total shares outstanding, which he purchased beginning in
late 1988.
   Since then the Storehouse board consistently has refused to
discuss various Edelman suggestions for enhancing the company's
stock price.
   ``I propose that we now meet to discuss the acquisition of
Storehouse by the Edelman group,'' Edelman wrote in a letter to
Storehouse directors.
   Edelman's proposed bid also would depend on finalizing his
financing for the offer and a commitment from Sir Terence Conran to
sell Edelman his shares.
   Conran, Storehouse's chairman, owns around 30 million shares, or
7.3 percent of the total.
   Storehouse shares have recently slumped amid mounting evidence of
the company's difficulties.
   Last week, Storehouse said its pretax profit dropped to 11.3
million pounds, or $17.6 million, in the fiscal year ended April 1
from 114.9 million pounds, or $179 million, the year before.
   Last year, Edelman transplanted part of his investment business
to Europe. He previously had made profitable runs on major U.S.
companies including Lucky Stores Inc. and Fruehauf Corp.

In a Lull</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Antonio Cipollone, his name out of the
newspapers and into the lawbooks, has gone back to a quiet retiree
life, strolling on the boardwalk, visiting relatives and traveling a
bit.
   One trip brought the 65-year-old Italian immigrant to the United
Nations May 31, where the World Health Organization awarded him a
medal for his landmark legal fight.
   A year ago Tuesday, six federal court jurors here awarded him
$400,000 for the lung-cancer death of his wife Rose, the nation's
first damages judgment in a smoker-death case.
   ``I don't know if I could do it again,'' said Cipollone, of
Lakehurst, N.J. ``I was really tired, let's face it. It was every
day, every day. It was really rough for a while.''
   For 4{ months, all eyes in the $22 billion tobacco industry and
anti-smoking forces were focused on Cipollone's court case against
Liggett Group Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. The
companies made the cigarettes smoked by Mrs. Cipollone for 40 years
before she died at the age of 58 five years ago.
   Jurors found that Liggett had violated an express warranty, or
advertising promise that its products were safe. All three companies
were absolved of conspiring to defraud the public about the health
dangers of smoking.
   But the industry's 30-year invincibility had been violated, and
tobacco opponents were encouraged that a new surge of lawsuits might
be launched.
   It has not happened.
   From a peak of 150 in 1987, the number of pending suits against
the industry has dropped to around 80, cigarette companies and
tobacco analysts say.
   ``In a sense, they're quiet times,'' said Richard Daynard, a
Northeastern University law professor who heads the Tobacco Products
Liability Project, which supports lawyers suing the cigarette
industry.
   ``I think people are waiting for additional developments _
plaintiffs' attorneys _ before they make their investments in these
cases,'' he said.
   The industry and some Wall Street analysts see the anti-smoking
litigants in retreat.
   ``The proof is in the pudding,'' said Kurt A. Feuerman, an
analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. ``The number of cases is much
lower.''
   He points to other numbers: the continued flood of profits to the
cigarette makers and the health of their stock.
   The day after the verdict, tobacco stocks retreated but have
since come back mightily. Philip Morris' post-verdict price of about
$83, for example, is now around $140.
   The industry also argued that the relatively small award
discouraged other would-be anti-tobacco lawyers from suing in light
of the years of work and millions of dollars needed to battle the
industry.
   ``It was an absolute masterpiece of spin control on their part,
to take a defeat and turn it into if not a victory, at least a
non-defeat,'' countered Daynard.
   Cipollone's lead attorney, Marc Z. Edell, acknowledged some
attorneys may have been discouraged.
   ``I think the momentum of the cases has stopped, basically, and
the easy pot of gold at the end of the rainbow that a lot of lawyers
anticipated would rise out of these cases just isn't there.''
   What's needed is expertise in developing such cases and practice
in trying them, he said.
   This fall should bring a flurry of activity. Three cases are set
for trial then in Beaumont, Texas; Boston; and Lexington, Miss.
   Daynard still believes that some day the Cipollone case will
prove a watershed in tobacco litigation.
   He reports receiving requests for 150 sets of documents
introduced at the Cipollone trial. The case was considered unique
for the large quantity of damaging corporate memos and reports
introduced at trial.
   Anti-tobacco litigants say their availability sharply reduces the
enormous costs of waging a legal war against cigarette makers.
   Edell, who has made about 20 lecture appearances since the trial,
said the case also led to a ``tremendous volume of inquiries'' from
other would-be plaintiffs, though he has taken no new cases.
   ``We don't want to undertake the financial commitment as well as
the professional commitment to represent people when we don't know
what the future will bring,'' he said, referring to the pending
appeal of the Cipollone verdict. He has five cigarette cases on hold
in New Jersey.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering Liggett's
challenge to the express warranty verdict. The state Supreme Court
also is considering Edell's challenge of a 1987 New Jersey law
excusing cigarettes from the risk-utility theory of liability _ that
is, whether a product's risk outweighs its usefulness.
   Recent state court decisions favor both sides. The California
Supreme Court last month upheld a 1987 state law barring liability
suits over ``inherently unsafe'' products, including cigarettes.
   A month earlier, the Minnesota Supreme Court found that warning
labels on cigarette packs starting in 1966 do not give tobacco
companies complete immunity from lawsuits, as other courts have held.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat futures
breaking out of a three-day slump caused by conditions in China.
   ``President Bush's statement about China gave wheat traders more
enthusiasm after they had some concern previous (Chinese) purchases
could be canceled,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst for LIT America
Inc. in Chicago.
   Bush said Thursday he did not want to cut grain sales to China
despite the domestic turmoil there.
   Wheat prices also reacted to weekend weather forecasts that call
for heavy rain in winter wheat crop areas, analysts said. The rain
is expected to interfere with harvesting.
   Trading in corn futures continues to be lackluster, with prices
down Friday as foreign sales continue on the light side.
   The surge in the value of the dollar weighed heavily on soybean
prices. The strong dollar is expected to reduce soybean export
prospects.
   The drop in prices for the July soybean contract is reflecting

   The stock market declined slightly today, faced
with news of a bigger-than-expected increase in producer prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.31 to 2,513.60
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 659 up, 778 down and
519 unchanged.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.9 percent in May, substantially outpacing
advance estimates by brokerage-firm economists.
   Analysts said the news dampened hopes that the Federal Reserve
would continue any time soon with what looked in recent days like
the start of a move to relax its credit policy.
   Nevertheless, some observers said they were impressed with the
market's relatively calm reaction to the news.
   Unexpected jumps in the producer price index earlier this year
touched off sharp declines in stock prices.
   The blow apparently was cushioned this time by several factors,
including continued strength of the dollar in foreign exchange and a
strong bond market.
   Yields on long-term government bonds, which were above 9 percent
less than three months ago, fell below 8.2 percent in today's
trading.
   USX led the active list, up 1 at 38 on renewed speculation that
financier Carl Icahn, who has a large stake in the company, might be
planning a takeover or some other transaction.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down { at 108}; General Electric, down [ at 54], and
General Motors, down ] at 41[.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .18 to 182.21. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .07 at 365.93.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 147.47 million shares with an

<HEAD>Hooker May Sell U.S. Malls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAIRFIELD, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of Australian developer
Hooker Corp. said Friday that it has retained an investment adviser
to consider selling, refinancing or finding partners for three of
its U.S. shopping malls.
   LJ Hooker Developments, an Atlanta-based division of Hooker, said
it has hired First Boston Corp. to look into joint ventures or
refinancing proposals for the malls. The properties include the
Forest Fair Mall in suburban Cincinnati, Richland Fashion Mall in
Columbia, S.C., and Thornton Town Center in Thornton, Colo., near
Denver.
   Hiring First Boston does not necessarily mean Hooker plans to
sell the malls outright, the company said in a statement.
   The 1.8-million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall, which opened three
months ago, has leased 87 percent of its available space. The other
two malls are scheduled to open later this year.
   Reports circulated earlier in the week that Hooker was seeking
buyers for the malls, but Glass said, ``Our preference is to joint
venture these projects ... (we would) welcome a financial partner
for these malls while we continue to operate them.''
   Glass said his company plans to concentrate on retail mall
development in the United States, a field it entered three years
ago. But Hooker also is seeking to cut the debt it acquired after
rapidly expanding its U.S. retailing properties.
   Company officials said any transactions involving the malls will
not involve Bonwit Teller, B. Altman, Parisian or Sakowitz, stores
owned by LJ Hooker Developments.
   The move comes less than 10 days after Hooker chairman George
Herscu announced that his company would sell $740 million of its
assets, mostly in Australia, to ease a cash crunch caused by its
American expansion.
   The root of Hooker's cash flow problems is in Australia, said Jim
Cox, Hooker's chief operating officer there.
   Hooker, which is Australia's second-largest home builder, watched
soaring home mortgage rates in that country soften the residential
market. That, coupled with huge debt payments stemming from its U.S.
expansion, has left the company unable to pay some creditors.
   Hooker officials said in late May that the company had fallen
behind in payments to several apparel suppliers, some of which
halted shipments to Bonwit Teller and B. Altman.
   But Cox said Wednesday that his company was not having severe
problems in America. Refinancing or selling the malls is a strategic
move, he said.
   ``Hooker isn't an investment company. It's a development
company,'' he said. ``We don't hold properties once they are
completed. We sell them.''
   LJ Hooker said it has five other mall sites, including work
recently begun in Tampa, Fla., and Cary, N.C.
   ``Subject to getting our anchor groups together, we intend to
develop these malls,'' Glass said.

<TEXT>
   A string of oil discoveries in the eastern
desert and a new determination to encourage private business are
helping socialist Syria climb out of a deep economic trough.
   With the help of Western oil companies, the country this year
became a net oil exporter for the first time, with revenues of $550
million forecast by early 1990.
   ``Self-sufficiency in energy is something you really appreciate
when you've never had it before,'' Economy Minister Mohammed Imadi
said in an interview.
   ``The studies show that we have a continuous oil and gas supply
for our needs and a surplus for export whenever we need the foreign
exchange,'' he said.
   For the Syrians, whose economy has been in such poor shape it
barely had enough foreign exchange to cover one week's imports, the
oil flow offers the prospect of badly needed money.
   The modest oil boom has come as Syria struggles to reduce annual
inflation of more than 65 percent and repay its $18 billion foreign
debt.
   Three-quarters of that is owed to the Soviet Union, mostly for
arms supplies for President Hafez Assad's determination to make
Syria strategically equal to neighboring enemy Israel.
   The oil strikes have come at a critical time for Syria, which has
suffered political setbacks in the region and is under pressure from
the Arabs and the Soviets to moderate hardline policies hindering
the Middle East peace process.
   Saudi Arabia this year stopped annual payments to Syria of around
$540 million for its role as a frontline Arab state facing Israel.
   Other Arab states have long halted aid to Syria, mainly because
of Assad's alliance with Persian Iran against Arab Iraq in the
8-year gulf war.
   Oil giants Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, Occidental
Petroleum of the United States, and France's Total are among 10
foreign companies involved in exploring and developing the new
fields as quickly as possible.
   ``It's a high-pressure job because the Syrians are really in a
rush to get the oil out of the ground,'' said one exploration
expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The better we do, the
more we're asked to do.''
   Syria has been pumping around 150,000 barrels a day of heavy
crude from the Souweidieh fields in the northeast since the early
1970s and mixing it with imported light crude for domestic use.
   Prospecting at that time by the country's East bloc allies
brought no results, but advanced technology helped Shell locate the
Thayyem fields in 1984.
   The new wells already are producing around 200,000 barrels a day
of saleable crude, raising overall output to 350,000 barrels a day,
more than double the country's needs.
   But because the deposits are ``generally small and fractured,
exploration will have to be continuous in order to guarantee
long-term supplies,'' the expert said.
   Oil Minister Mutanious Habib recently told the Middle East
Economic Survey, an oil industry newsletter, that another 50,000
barrels a day will be added later this year from three new fields.
   He said Syria was evaluating potential reserves throughout the
country in what he called a crucial year for exploration.
   The government also has signed a contract with Marathon Oil of
the United States to develop natural gas deposits south of ancient
Palmyra, to be used instead of oil and hydro-power for generating
electricity.
   Imadi said the increased oil output and a record harvest
following higher-than-average rainfall helped the economy grow by a
staggering 10.7 percent last year.
   This year, agricultural production will fall sharply because of a
winter drought that is already causing water shortages in Damascus.
But officials estimate that the oil boom will still fuel growth of
around 7.2 percent a year.
   Syria is negotiating barter deals to settle accounts with foreign
creditors and cut import bills. Phosphate exports, for example, will
pay for importing antibiotics from France and Italy.
   A senior government official said that a crackdown on smuggling
is working, but that incentives for private businessmen are more
effective for curbing the black economy.
   Contraband ranging from bananas and French cheeses to clothing
and computer software arrives in Syria by the truckload from
neighboring Lebanon, foreign residents of Damascus say.
   Under the new incentives, businessmen can use up to 75 percent of
their export earnings to finance imports. They can also go into
partnership with the government in tourism, transportation and
agricultural business projects.
   To attract expatriate Syrians to invest at home, tax incentives
and a law allowing businessmen to transfer earnings abroad are being
prepared. There are plans, too, for reviving the Damascus stock
market after a quarter-century gap.
   ``It's common sense to have the private sector more actively
involved in the economy,'' Imadi said.
   But Western diplomats predict it will be a while before the
Syrian economy takes off.
   ``There's a great commercial tradition here, but because of the
complex bureaucracy, and corruption, it can't be revived from one
day to the next,'' one commented.
   Syrians say they find it hard to manage on salaries that range
from about $63 a month for a taxi driver to $125 for a university
professor.
   The government recently hiked wages by 25 percent, but that only
seemed to intensify the inflation problem. Gasoline prices
immediately jumped by 50 percent and some food costs rose by 30
percent.

<HEAD>OPEC Nations Fail to Tackle Tough Problems Despite Accord, Analysts
Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   OPEC may have reached a new accord among
its members for limiting crude oil production, but analysts say the
cartel failed to tackle tough problems that have been weakening its
influence in the world oil market.
   At this past week's meetings, OPEC settled on raising its
production cap from the current 18.5 million barrels a day to 19.5
million barrels to support a benchmark price of $18 a 42-gallon
barrel.
   It divided the 1 million-barrel increase in production
proportionately, raising each member's supply quota a certain amount.
   But still at issue despite the new pact are continued demands by
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and several others in the 13-member
Organization of Petroleum Countries for a larger share of the
cartel's daily output.
   Kuwait pressed the issue so strongly at the organization's
just-ended meeting that the talks nearly collapsed.
   ``A lot of problems were swept under the carpet,'' said Fergus
MacLeod, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.
   OPEC ministers plan to meet again in September and take a hard
look at some persistent woes. Indonesia's oil minister, Ginandjar
Kartasasmita, predicted the meeting would be ``crucial for the
history of OPEC.''
   Kuwait's Ali Khalifa al-Sabah endorsed only parts of the
agreement reached late Wednesday after six days of bargaining but
said the nation refused to meet its alloted limit.
   Sabah said Kuwait immediately would slash production to 1.35
million barrels a day. That would be well above Kuwait's
July-December quota of 1.09 million barrels a day but sharply under
its estimated current output of nearly 2 million barrels.
   Analysts estimate OPEC already is producing about 21 million
barrels a day, so the cartel would have to rein in output to meet
the new target.
   The oil markets initially reacted skeptically to the pact, with
U.S. crude futures tumbling before stabilizing at lower levels.
   Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets in New York, said the agreement injects ``a dose of
pessimism because it signals OPEC is unable to deal with the quota
issue.''
   ``It does not bode well for prices (in the short term),'' he said.
   He said prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.
crude, could slip into the range of $15 to $17 a barrel in the
July-September quarter.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate fell 12 cents to
$19.88 on Friday, up from the lows of less than $13 a barrel reached
late last year.
   But MacLeod said prices would hold fairly steady if Kuwait and
others did not cheat too much on their quotas. Although Sabah said
Kuwait would not obey its quota, MacLeod said, ``He is suggesting he
will show more restraint than expected.''
   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at the investment firm
Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New York, estimated actual cartel production
would be just under 21 million barrels a day.
   ``That level of production could lead to some erosion from
today's price level but nothing too serious,'' he said.
   As a result, there should not be much impact on gasoline prices
at the pump, Mlotok said.
   In addition to Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates _ a persistent
cheater _ was expected to continue producing more than its share.
Its new quota is about a million barrels a day but it has been
producing an estimated 1.6 million barrels.
   Gabon and Ecuador also tend to exceed their quotas.
   To control the leakage, the producers would have to do something
about the sensitive quota issue. But to give more oil to one country
means the cartel would have to make the unpopular move of taking
away some from another.
   ``Every member probably considers itself to be a special case
(for a higher quota),'' said Ian Graham, analyst at the London-based
County NatWest.

<TEXT>
   The nuclear industry said it couldn't
happen, but some scientists now believe the 1986 accident at the
Soviet Union's Chernobyl power plant exploded like an atomic bomb.
   An article in Friday's Technology Review, a journal published by
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says similar accidents
could happen at 13 other nuclear reactors in the Soviet Union.
   However, ``the possibility of such an accident in a U.S. reactor
is vanishingly small,'' wrote William Sweet, a reporter for Physics
Today, published by the American Institute of Physics.
   Sweet gathered his information in interviews with scientists and
specialists at the Nuclear Regulatory Commmission and the U.S.
Department of Energy.
   ``A runaway nuclear reaction set off a chain of events that
severely damaged the reactor core and surrounding structures,''
Sweet wrote.
   ``This damage set the stage for a second explosion which was much
more violent than the first and almost certainly was a full-fledged
nuclear explosion.''
   Some scientists say the article accurately reports current
thinking, but others say it is causing unnecessary alarm.
   ``To call this a nuclear explosion is very misleading,'' said
Themis Speis, deputy research chief at the NRC.
   ``The reactor went out of control, but the time it took to raise
the temperature and pressure is many orders of magnitude smaller
than it takes to get an atomic bomb going,'' he said.
   John Ahearne, former NRC chairman, said, ``I wouldn't call it a
nuclear explosion.''
   Harvard University physics Professor Richard Wilson said in the
article, ``It was a nuclear explosion; there's no doubt, because the
ultimate source of energy was nuclear.
   ``To ever say it was not a nuclear explosion is just plain
wrong.''
   The argument is one of semantics, said Gregory Van Tuyle, a
nuclear engineer at the Brookhaven National Laboratory.
   The plant was not destroyed by a steam explosion as scientists
had believed, but ``power grew to very large levels very rapidly,''
he said. ``The phrase `nuclear explosion' is not inappropriate.''
   The accident, blamed for the deaths of at least 31 people,
injured many more and spread radiation for thousands of miles.
   Sweet acknowledged that the reactor at Chernobyl ``exploded'' far
more slowly and with much less energy than a bomb. But, he said,
official reports suggest the reactor's fuel formed a critical mass,
reacted uncontrollably, melted and vaporized.
   It ``would be deeply misleading to say that the plant did not
blow up like an atomic bomb,'' he said.
   ``Ever since the first nuclear power plants were built in the
1950s, the industry has insisted they can't explode like bombs,''
Sweet said. ``Chernobyl casts doubt on whether that is true of all
power reactors.
   ``Of the plants operating in North America, however, only the
Canadian plants are susceptible to a Chernobyl-type accident.''
   In an interview Friday from his New York office, Sweet said a
Chernobyl-type accident is unlikely in the United States because
U.S. commercial reactors have safer designs.

   Scotty's Inc., a hardware and home

   Scotty's, which operates 164 stores, said the GIB Group of

not already own.
   GIB Group, which has a network of do-it-yourself stores in the

billion. It also sells food and general merchandise.
   The company already owns 42.4 percent of Scotty's 14.7 million
shares outstanding.
   After the tender offer is completed, Scotty's will merge with a
GIB Group affiliate. Any outstanding shares will be converted into a
right to receive $16.50 in cash.
   Scotty's operates 114 full-line stores and 50 hardware stores.
The company serves various markets with about 20,000 hardware,
lumber and home improvement products.

<HEAD>Teacher's Union Says Channel One Modification Are an Improvement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a national teachers union said Friday
that Whittle Communications' plans for the national launch of its
advertiser-supported news show for high schools represent a
``significant improvement'' over the experimental version of the
program.
   But Albert Shanker, president of the 700,000-member American
Federation of Teachers, stopped short of endorsing the project,
which is called Channel One and is scheduled to debut in March 1990.
   ``We are encouraged by the fact that Whittle Communications has
taken such extensive steps to address the problems associated with
its pilot project,'' he said in a statement.
   ``There are still problems, however _ commercial advertising is
still on and it is very questionable whether a fast-paced program
can truly help students to think more critically and thoughtfully
about news events, skills students desperately need,'' he said.
   Shanker was one of several national educational leaders that have
criticized the Channel One plan for giving advertisers an avenue for
pitching products to students in the classroom.
   Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle announced Thursday it planned to
launch Channel One in 1,000 schools across the country next March.
The program was tested in six schools earlier this year.
   Schools will be asked to sign a contract that will give them
about $40,000 or more worth of color televisions, satellite dishes
and videocassette recorders in exchange for showing a daily
12-minute news show that includes two minutes of paid advertising
during the school day.
   In the test, participating schools were required to show the
program in every classroom so the entire student body sees it each
day.
   Whittle said schools participating next spring would not be
required to show it to every student and could designate which
classrooms will be wired to receive the program.
   Kate Krell, a spokesman for Shanker, said the union also liked
Whittle's plan to include smaller schools among those eligible to
participate.

   Stock prices were little changed Friday as the

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 3.49 to 2,513.42,
finishing the week with a net loss of 4.41 points.
   Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 759 up, 773

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 173.24 million
shares, down from 212.31 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including

   Analysts said the news dampened hopes that the Federal Reserve
would continue any time soon with what looked in recent days like
the start of a move to relax its credit policy.
   Nevertheless, some observers said they were impressed with the
market's relatively calm reaction to the news. Unexpected jumps in
the producer price index earlier this year touched off sharp
declines in stock prices.
   The blow apparently was cushioned this time by several factors,
including continued strength of the dollar in foreign exchange and a
strong bond market.
   Yields on long-term government bonds, which were above 9 percent
less than three months ago, fell below 8.2 percent in Friday's
trading.
   Activity inspired by takeover news and rumors once again
dominated the session.
   USX ranked among the volume leaders, up 1 at 38 on renewed
speculation that financier Carl Icahn, who has a large stake in the
company, might be planning a takeover or some other transaction.
   Syntex, a frequent subject of takeover talk, gained 2 to 54.
   Sea Containers Ltd. jumped 4~ to 65\. The company rejected an
unsolicited offer from the European companies Tiphook PLC and Stena
A.B.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down ~ at 108]; General Motors, down \ at 41\, and Eastman
Kodak, down { at 50]. Kodak shares had run up lately on takeover
rumors.
   Precious metals stocks were weak as the price of gold tumbled
$15.40 to $358.10 on the Commodity Exchange in New York. ASA Ltd.
lost ~ to 40| and Hecla Mining dropped { to 12\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $1.34 billion, or 0.04
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dipped
.02 to 182.37.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .01 to 373.53, and S&amp;P's

   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market

   K mart Corp., hoping to attract customers and
rejuvenate sluggish sales, is borrowing a marketing tactic more
common among supermarkets: a double-coupon day on Saturday at all of
its 2,200 discount stores.
   K mart normally accepts manufacturers' coupons for face value.
Saturday, coupons worth up to 50 cents will be doubled in value,
said Teri Kula, senior marketing coordinator.
   The nation's second-largest retailer after Sears, Roebuck and
Co., is trying to jump-start sales after a disappointing first
quarter in which profit slumped 22 percent.
   ``Our experience has told us if you want to bring in traffic,
there's nothing like a double-coupon sale,'' said Mike Wellman, vice
president of marketing.
   Double coupons are relatively expensive promotions because the
retailer must absorb the cost of the extra discount.
   They won't cost K mart as much as the normal grocery store, where
large numbers of products are promoted through money-off coupons,
Wellman said. ``In our area, it's basically health and beauty
aids,'' he said.
   K mart has used the technique before in selected markets, but
never nationwide. ``It will be a one-time only thing this year,''
Wellman said.
   Industry analysts said K mart's move suggests the retailer is
anxious to keep its cash registers ringing as much as possible.
   ``It indicates ... their traffic is off and they need people to
swing in those doors again,'' Bloomfield Hills marketing consultant
Frederick Marx said.
   New pricing policies at industry giant Sears are believed to have
steered customers away from competitors' stores.
   Analysts say, however, that it is difficult to quantify how much
business may have been lost by discounters such as K mart to Sears
since it launched its everyday low prices strategy on March 1.
   K mart's Kula conceded that retailers are confronting competitive
challenges which call for special approaches.
   ``There's no getting around the fact that it's an extremely
competitive environment,'' Kula said. ``Retailers need to do what
they can to get people into the stores. It indicates we're
maintaining our competitive stance in the marketplace.''
   Wellman of K mart said he didn't expect the move to touch off
immediate responses by other discounters. ``Each one has their own
strategy,'' he said.
   Sears doesn't use promotions involving coupons, and spokeswoman
Kathy Gucfa said the retailer wouldn't comment on K mart's strategy.
   Another retailer, Target Stores Inc., intends to stick with its
weekly circular of sales items and also has no plans for
coupon-oriented promotions, said spokesman George Hite at Target
headquarters in Minneapolis.
   Analyst Paul Alexandrakis of Argus Research in New York, said K
mart's ``sales have been a bit slow. This might be an experimental
way to see if they can shore them up.''
   Alexandrakis also didn't foresee a bandwagon effect, unless such
a promotion showed results over a longer period.
   ``If it's a one-time thing, just to experiment, I wouldn't see
the others jumping in,'' he said.

<HEAD>Energy Futures Fall as Market Digests Results of OPEC Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices fell in slow trading Friday
as the markets began to digest the results of the latest OPEC
meeting.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $19.88 per 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 12 cents from Thursday, when
the contract gained 33 cents.
   Wholesale gasoline and crude oil prices also fell.
   Unleaded gasoline slipped 0.28 cent to 63.72 cents a gallon while
home heating oil was off 1.63 cents to 47.03 cents a gallon. The
drop in heating oil was attributed in part to sluggish demand
typical for this time of year.
   ``Traders were feeling a lot of post-OPEC meeting depression,''
said James Fiedler, an oil market analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   Fiedler called such a reaction by the market normal following a
meeting by the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   OPEC ministers agreed late Wednesday to boost the cartel's
overall production ceiling to 19.5 million barrels a day during the
July-December period. The new ceiling is 1 million barrels a day
higher than the current level but below the estimated daily output
in recent weeks of about 21 million barrels.
   ``People just wanted to catch their breath and go home for the
weekend and try to figure out what it means,'' Fiedler said.
   He described trading as quiet.
   The OPEC ministers, who reached the agreement at their
semi-annual meeting in Vienna _ agreed to divide the extra
production proportionately among all members.
   Analysts said this means some countries will have to curtail some
pumping to keep within their self-imposed quotas.

<HEAD>Boeing Looking at Stretched Version of 767-300</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LE BOURGET, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boeing Co. official Friday confirmed
speculation that the company is interested in making a stretched
version of the Boeing 767-300 to fill a market niche for planes a
bit smaller than the 747 jumbo jet.
   Richard Albrecht, Boeing's senior vice president of marketing and
finance, told a news conference at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget
that the company would like to offer a model larger than the 767 but
smaller than the 747. The new model would compete with McDonnell
Douglas Corp.'s new MD-11 and Airbus Industrie's new A330, both of
which seat about 300 passengers.
   Boeing's stock has been falling all week because industry
analysts suggested that an estimated $2 billion development cost for
the new plane would hurt profits of the Seattle-based aircraft maker.
   ``Among the alternatives being considered are a further stretch
of the 767-300 or an all-new, nine-abreast fuselage with a new wing
and larger engines,'' Albrecht said.
   The 767-300 has seven-abreast seating for up to 261 passengers. A
mid-1995 target date has been set by Boeing for certification of a
stretched plane, dubbed the 767-X.
   Albrecht said Boeing is ``in discussion with potential customers
for the 767-X,'' but hasn't yet received a target number of firm
orders needed to officially launch the plane.
   Analysts have said United Airlines and British Airways PLC may be
the launch customers.

   The dollar soared against major foreign
currencies Friday in a powerful buying wave touched off by an
unexpectedly high U.S. inflation reading, strength in the bond
market and continuing tension in the Far East.
   Gold prices sank as much as $15 an ounce amid profit-taking.
   John McCarthy, chief dealer at the New York office of Amsterdam
Rotterdam Bank, said currency dealers drove the dollar past several
psychologically significant thresholds against the West German mark.
   At the end of trading in New York, the dollar stood at 2.010
marks, up from 1.9725 late Thursday.
   A key catalyst for the buying was the Labor Department report of
a 0.9 percent increase in the Producer Price Index in May.
   The figure, which exceeded economists' estimates, revived
speculation that U.S. interest rates might have to remain high for
now to prevent inflation from veering out of control. High U.S.
rates make returns on dollar-denominated investments attractive,
which tends to encourage dollar buying.
   Prior to the report, a belief was spreading that the Federal
Reserve Board soon would relax its guarded credit stance and allow
interest rates to recede.
   Currency dealers were heartened by the credit market's attitude
toward the inflation news.
   Bond traders, who normally react negatively to rising inflation,
shrugged off the numbers and bought partly on the grounds that U.S.
government securities offered a safe-haven in a time of uncertain
investment conditions in several countries.
   The unrest in China has made some investors jittery about the
entire Far East while political troubles in Japan have weighed down
the yen.
   McCarthy said dealers bought dollars despite being wary about the
possibility of central bank intervention.
   No government authorities were detected buying and selling
currencies in the market Friday except the Bank of Japan, which
intervened during the European trading day to slow the dollar's
advance, dealers said.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo and rose 0.45 yen to a
closing of 143.50 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 146.05
yen. And in New York the dollar rose to 146.49 from 143.25 Thursday.
   In London, the dollar gained sharply against the British pound.
It cost $1.5545 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.5735 late
Thursday. Later in New York, sterling declined further against the
dollar to $1.5485 compared to $1.5773 Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's levels, included: 1.7475 Swiss francs, up from 1.7085;
1.20145 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1973; 6.7987 French francs, up
from 6.6910; and, 1,457.75 Italian lire, up from 1,435.5.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's rates were:
2.0025 Deutsche marks, up from 1.9770; 1.7402 Swiss francs, up from
1.7100; 6.7810 French francs, up from 6.7040; 2.2510 Dutch guilders,
up from 2.2220; 1,450.50 Italian lire, up from 1,439.50; 1.1999
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1967.
   Bullion dealers said the market reacted to the higher dollar by
selling to collect profits on the precious metal's gains made
earlier in the week.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $363.25 a troy ounce,
compared with $373.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold closed at a bid
$368.05 compared with $374.35 late Thursday.
   Later on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for
current delivery fell to $358.10 a troy ounce from Thursday's
settlement of $373.50. Republic National Bank of New York said gold
was bid at $357 an ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $372.80 late
Thursday.
   Gold closed in Hong Kong at $372.53, down $4.08 from Wednesday's
close. Hong Kong markets were closed Thursday.
   Silver bullion prices fell on the London market where the metal
was trading at a late bid price of $5.27 a troy ounce, compared with
Thursday's $5.44. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.162 an ounce from $5.443 Thursday.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Prices Drop Sharply</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices plunged Friday on New York's
Commodity Exchange, with both gold and silver reaching new contract
lows.
   On other markets, grain and soybean prices were mostly lower,
livestock prices were higher and meat futures lower, and energy
prices slipped.
   The declines came as the U.S. Labor Department released its
Producer Price Index, which showed a steep 0.9 percent rise in May.
   In advance of Friday's report, many economists predicted a
moderate-to-brisk 0.5 percent gain in the index that reflects the
cost of consumer items. Selling in the futures markets snowballed
during the day.
   Gold settled $15.40 to $18.80 lower with the contract for
delivery in June at $358.10 a troy ounce; silver was 28.1 cents to
33.5 cents lower with June at $5.162 a troy ounce.
   ``This is the biggest decline we've had in a year,'' said Craig
Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. ``It is
also a disappointment for all those who thought Tuesday's rally, the
best this year, was a sign the market had bottomed out and was
starting an upswing.''
   Gold prices jumped $13.60 on Tuesday.
   Sloane added the surge in the dollar also proved to be negative
for precious metals prices.
   The dollar is looked upon as a better investment as its value
rises, causing many investors to abandon gold and silver.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade, with wheat futures breaking out of a
three-day slump caused by conditions in China.
   ``President Bush's statement about China gave wheat traders more
enthusiasm after they had some concern previous (Chinese) purchases
could be canceled,'' said Jerry Gidel, an analyst for LIT America
Inc. in Chicago.
   Bush said Thursday he did not want to cut grain sales to China
despite the domestic turmoil there.
   Wheat prices also reacted to weekend weather forecasts that call
for heavy rain in winter wheat crop areas, analysts said. The rain
is expected to interfere with harvesting.
   Trading in corn futures continued to be lackluster, with prices
down Friday as foreign sales remained light.
   The surge in the value of the dollar weighed heavily on soybean
prices. The strong dollar is expected to reduce soybean export
prospects. The drop in prices for the July soybean contract reflects
concern over increased farmer selling interest, analysts said.
   Wheat settled a { cent to 4} cents higher with July at $3.86{ a
bushel; corn was a \ cent to 1{ cents lower with July at $2.51} a
bushel; oats were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower with July at $1.62{ a
bushel; soybeans were 11{ cents lower to 3{ cents higher with July
at $7.02{ a bushel.
   Livestock prices were higher and meat futures lower on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices rose on the belief the market had sold off enough.
Traders were looking beyond the present weak cash market to the
expection of increased feedlot placement, said Tom Morgan, an
analyst with Sterling Research Corp. in Chicago.
   Hog prices were down because of an erosion in wholesale pork
product prices. Frozen pork bellies were down because of high cold
storage figures.
   Live cattle were .03 cent to .80 cent higher with June at 69.82 a
pound; feeder cattle were .60 cent to .93 cent higher with August at
79.95 a pound; hogs were .08 cent to .40 cent lower with June at
47.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .45 cent lower to .70
higher with July at 31.95 cents a pound.
   Energy futures dropped on the New York Mercantile Exchange as
technical weakness set in late in the trading session.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents to 36 cents
lower with July at $19.88 a barrel; heating oil was 1.08 cents to
1.63 cents lower with July at 47.03 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .28 cent to .81 cent lower with July at 63.72 cents a
gallon.

   Bond prices surged Friday, pushing long-term
interest rates to their lowest level in more than two years despite
a bigger-than-expected rise in a key inflation indicator.
   The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond climbed by about 1| points,
or $16.25 for every $1,000 in face amount.
   The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from
price, skidded to 8.14 percent _ the lowest since it finished at
8.06 percent on April 9, 1987 _ and down from 8.29 percent late
Thursday.
   ``What we were treated to today is what sometimes happens in bull
markets where everything becomes good news,'' said William Griggs, a
partner in the investment firm Griggs &amp; Santow Inc.
   The government reported inflation at the wholesale level shot up
0.9 percent in May, an increase was twice as big as many analysts
expected.
   An indication that inflation is growing more rapidly than
expected normally depresses bond prices because it increases chances
the Federal Reserve may to boost interest rates to curb inflation.
   Traders said prices of some 30-year issues plunged a full point
immediately after the report was released. But within minutes,
prices began retracing lost ground.
   Mitchell Held, chief economist with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said traders decided to continue buying bonds for fear of
missing out on the rally.
   ``This shouldn't be happening, but it is,'' he said.
   A strong dollar helped fuel the bond rally, as foreign investors
attracted to the currency by the uncertain international situation
due to events in China plowed their dollar holdings into government
notes and bonds, analysts said.
   But Steven A. Wood, economist for BankAmerica Capital Markets
Group in San Francisco, said there was substantial interest by
domestic buyers as well.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term governments rose by between [ point and \ point,
intermediate maturities rose by between 7-16 point and } point and
long-term issues picked up as much as 1 15-16 points, the financial
information service Telerate Inc. said.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 7.17 to 1,180.70.
   In corporate trading, industrials also were higher. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return
on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years
or longer, rose 2.59 to 325.33.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose ] point. The average yield to maturity
fell to 7.30 percent from 7.33 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on some short-term Treasury securities edged higher,
however, reflecting what analysts called speculation that the
inflation report would limit the Fed's inclination to ease credit
for the time being.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.46 percent as the
discount rose 7 basis points to 8.18 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.28 percent as the discount advanced 8 basis points
to 7.85 percent. Yields on one-year bills slipped to 8.28 percent
and the discount fell 1 basis point to 7.70 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   Nonetheless, the federal funds rate slipped to 9[ percent, down
from 9] percent late Thursday. The funds rate is the interest that
banks charge each other for short-term loans. The Federal Reserve
can influence the rate by buying or selling securities in the open
market, thereby adding to or draining the reserves within the
banking system.
   A decline in the fed funds rate from 9 9-16 percent last Friday
has been interpreted as a sign that the Fed has adopted a more
generous credit policy.

   Douglas Aircraft Co. said Friday that two French airlines and the
national airline of Zambia have placed orders and options for a
total of 11 MD-11 long-range jets valued at about $1.4 billion.
   Rival Boeing Co., meanwhile, announced an order from Air France
for three Boeing 747-200 freighters and 12 737-500 passenger jets,
with options on six more 737-500s. Industry analysts estimated the
value of the firm orders at around $625 million.
   In other announcements, American Airline's commuter carrier said
it has purchased 25 aircraft from British Aerospace PLC with options
for up to 75 more, and Boeing Co. said Ethiopian Airlines has
ordered four Boeing 757 passenger jets and one 757 freighter.
   The MD-11 jets were ordered by Minerve SA and Air Outre Mer of
France and Zambia Airways, Russell L. Ray, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft, announced at the Paris Air Show in Le Bourget, France.
   Douglas Aircraft is a subsidiary of McDonnell Douglas Corp., a
major aircraft maker based in St. Louis.
   Air Outre Mer, a new Paris-based airline, has ordered four MD-11s
for delivery starting in 1994 and has taken options on another four.
Air Outre Mer will use the new planes for flights from France to
Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean and to other long-range
destinations, Ray said.
   Minerve, a Paris-based regional carrier, has ordered one MD-11
and taken an option on another. The airline first ordered MD-11s
last September, Ray said.
   Zambia Airways, based in Lusaka, Zambia, has ordered one of the
planes for delivery in January 1992. General Electric Co. said in an
announcement from Evendale, Ohio, that the Zambian airline has
placed a $27 million order for GE-made CF6-80C2 engines to power the
new MD-11.
   Separately, AMR Eagle, the commuter subsidiary of American
Airlines, said it has bought 25 Jetstream Super 31 aircraft from
British Aerospace and has options for up to 25 more of the planes
and as many as 50 Jetstream 41s.
   AMR Eagle, based in Fort Worth, Texas, did not put a value on the
deal but industry sources estimated it at just under $500 million.
The Jetstream Super 31s carry 19 passengers and the 41s have 29
seats.
   Boeing announced that Ethiopian Airlines has ordered four 757
passenger jets and one 757 freighter in a deal worth about $260
million. The airline also has taken options on two more 757s.
   In a separate announcement at the Paris Air Show, Great China
Airlines announced the purchase of four Dash 8 Series 300 planes
from Boeing Canada's de Havilland division. That deal is valued at
about $52 million.

   Fred Ricart's 127 salespeople managed to
sell a record 24,000 Fords last year partly because of the zany
antics of their boss, a self-confessed ham who pitches cars in
television commercials by strumming a guitar and crooning lyrics
written by his 10-year-old daughter.
   Ricart, with $232.6 million in sales last year, says that minus
fleet sales, he is the No. 1 auto dealer period, although industry
accounts and rankings vary.
   He chides competitors who include fleet sales when tallying up
their sales figures. Ricart includes only automobiles sold to
individual customers for cash.
   ``Others say they're the biggest, but I don't believe in
comparing apples and oranges. We don't include fleet sales, period.
No one has ever topped 230 (million dollars in sales),'' he said.
   Cherub-faced Fred ``We're Dealin' '' Ricart is a local celebrity
in the country's 26th largest auto market, although much of the
guitar-touting auto mogul's business comes from out of town.
   Many of his 66 television commercials feature Ricart strumming
his six-string and singing words penned by his daughter (This Van is
Your Van, This Van is my Van; Whole Lotta Dealin' Goin' On!). He
plays 19 instruments and has a recording studio in his home.
   Ricart admits he couldn't carry a tune in the back of a pickup,
but ``I really am a pretty good guitar player.''
   People tell him his television pitches are annoying, but Ricart
believes they actually enjoy them, and according to the sales
figures, they certainly remember them.
   A $30 million inventory, including his nearby Van Land, sprawled
out on 77 acres on Columbus' east side makes Ricart Ford look more
like a small city than an auto dealership.
   ``We've made this a big Disneyland complex,'' said Ricart, 38,
who left college to help rescue his father's ailing Ford business 16
years ago. ``You don't see someone silly on TV and then come in and
see some snub-nosed salesman. We want to make it fun.''
   Parents can soon shop for a new set of wheels while their
children play video games at Ricart's day care center, now under
construction. Customers who are ever-fearful of the auto mechanic
can order a videotape of any repair work done on their cars.
   ``People just don't trust mechanics. You don't know if they do
what they say they're doing, so we'll videotape it just to be
sure,'' said Ricart, a former biology student at Case Western
Reserve University in Cleveland.
   The service center is open 24 hours, but if you're still too busy
to take in the T-Bird, a $23,000 diagnostic van will pull into your
driveway or office parking lot and a technician, clad in coat and
tie, will fix it there.
   Ricart admits his prices aren't the lowest. He says, however, his
dealer also fixes many cars for free even when they're no longer
under warranty.
   Success magazine, which called him the biggest dealer of American
autos in the world, said Ricart gave away $380,000 in service not
covered by warranty last year.
   ``People don't really care what they pay for a car. We're more
concerned with the human factor,'' says Ricart.
   Part of that approach is a Welcome Center where ``you're greeted
by a harmless person,'' who asks the customer what he's looking for,
then pages a salesman, says Ricart.
   ``I've walked in some dealerships and seen a pack of wolves in
the corner,'' he said. ``This was a rebellion dealership from the
beginning.''
   He said 66 percent of his business comes from outside Columbus
and 18 percent is out of state. In Columbus, Ricart said he has 71.4
percent of the market and the average customer drives 50 miles to
see his inventory.
   ``The average person figures I'm a normal guy, not a shyster
lawyer or a cunning CPA. And that's why I keep calling it the human
factor.''

   Wholesale inflation came roaring back in May
after a two-month respite, as prices soared for gasoline, fresh
vegetables and automobiles, the government reported Friday.
   The Labor Department's Producer Price Index jumped 0.9 percent
last month and is up at an annual rate of 9.4 percent so far this
year, more than double the 4 percent increase last year and
quadruple the 2.2 percent gain in 1987.
   However, Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser,
attributed most of the inflation this year to ``special factors''
and predicted better numbers ahead.
   He said food price increases will ease with the expected return
to normal weather following last year's drought. He added that crude
oil prices have stopped climbing and that should steady energy
prices.
   ``We want to remain vigilant (but) we expect inflation to
stabilize in the second half of the year and decline thereafter,''
he told reporters at a White House briefing.
   Private economists said Friday's report means the Federal Reserve
will wait at least a month before following up on its first
tentative step to loosen credit after 15 months of fighting
inflation with higher interest rates.
   The central bank nudged a key interest rate _ the rate banks
charge each other for overnight loans _ down early this week in the
hope that slower economic growth would soon dampen price pressures.
   Financial markets had rallied in response to that move, but they
dipped slightly in early trading Friday after traders interpreted
the price report as an indication the Fed will hesitate before
loosening again. Stock prices generally recovered by midday.
   ``I was guessing before that we might get another easing move
sometime in early July, but my view now is that the Fed will stop in
its tracks and hold for the next month or two,'' said economist
David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities
dealer in New York.
   Prices at the wholesale level had risen by 0.4 percent in both
April and March after rising 1.1 percent and 0.9 percent in January
and February, the worst two-month performance in eight years.
   The Labor Department identified three factors as big contributors
to the May price jump: gasoline, automobiles and vegetables.
   Gasoline prices rose 5.2 percent following an April climb of 13.4
percent, the steepest in more than two years. Energy prices overall
rose 3.3 percent in May. Natural gas prices increased 3.4 percent,
but heating oil costs declined 7.7 percent.
   Food prices, which had posted a rare 0.6 percent decline in
April, rebounded 0.8 percent in May. The price of vegetables
skyrocketed 26.4 percent as celery and tomato prices doubled and
cabbage prices rose by one-third.
   There were also significant increases for eggs, rice, pasta and
chicken. Prices for beef, pork and fish declined.
   Craig Howell, a Labor Department analyst, said tomato prices rose
strongly because of a temporary shortage after Florida growers
finished shipping their crop.
   The price of goods excluding the volatile food and energy
sectors, a figure often taken by analysts as a truer reflection of
underlying inflationary pressures, rose 0.5 percent last month
following an unusual 0.1 percent decline in April.
   The increase in May was largely driven by a 1.8 percent rebound
in auto prices following a 2.8 percent decline a month earlier.
Howell said auto manufacturers rolled back some of the rebate
programs they had been offering. Also, several manufacturers
announced price increases for options and for some specific models,
he said.
   Price gains also were posted for children's clothing, glassware,
mobile homes, toilet paper and tires.
   The overall May increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 114.2, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $114.20 last month, up
from $113 in April.
   Measures of inflation earlier in the production process were
mixed, with the price of intermediate goods rising only 0.1 percent
and the price of crude goods jumping 0.9 percent. However, excluding
food and energy, intermediate goods rose a modest 0.2 percent and
crude goods prices fell 0.4 percent.
   ``To the extent that crude and intermediate prices work their way
through to the finished goods level, that would suggest good news
for the months ahead,'' said Dirk Van Dongen, president of the
National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
   An example of the three processing stages _ finished,
intermediate and crude _ would be wholesale bread, flour and wheat.

   Paramount Communications Inc. lost a round Friday
in its $10.7 billion buyout bid for Time Inc. when a Delaware judge
denied Paramount's request to block a key provision of Time's merger
agreement with Warner Communications Inc.
   Delaware Chancery Court Judge William P. Allen said Paramount had
not produced enough evidence to support its request for a temporary
restraining order against a stock option agreement that allows Time
and Warner to buy each other's shares.
   Allen said ``...it has not been shown to my satisfaction that
Paramount has legal rights that will be irreparably injured by such
exercise (of the stock swap) or that the legal and equitable rights
of Time shareholders will be irreparably injured by such an act.''
   Those issues could be better addressed during a more fully
developed trial, Allen said in an eight-page ruling, adding that it
was likely to take Paramount months to complete any takeover of Time
anyway.
   Time and Warner both issued statements that they were pleased
with the decision and believed the stock swap arrangement was in the
best interests of their shareholders.
   Paramount said in a statement that it found the decision ``an
extremely satisfactory one'' even though it did not get the
temporary order it sought.
   ``The court has fully protected our position by assuring the
status quo. The court denied a TRO solely because it has the power
after a full hearing to undo any Time-Warner stock swap,'' the
Paramount statement said.
   The provision _ which was included in the agreement to block a
possible unwanted bid from a third party _ would further dilute the
companies' stock and make a takeover of either company more costly.
   Paramount sued in Delaware _ where Time is incorporated _ after
announcing its $175-a-share cash bid earlier this week. The
company's lawyers said in court Friday they would be satisified if
Time and Warner agreed not to amend the stock swap option and gave
Paramount five business days notice if they decided to trigger it.
   Lawyers for Time and Warner argued that the stock swap would not
damage any buyout offer and there was no need for the restraining
order or advance notice. Time and Warner shareholders, who earlier
filed suit to block the merger of the two communications giants,
joined the Paramount action, saying they feared parts of the
agreement could a chilling effect on other bids.
   They also asked for postponement of the June 23 meetings at which
Time and Warner shareholders are scheduled to vote on the merger.
   If Allen grants the restraining order, he would then hold
hearings on whether to hand down an injunction against the stock
swap.
   Time stock was up $1.50 to $169.50 a share in late trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. Paramount stock was up 12{ cents to $58.50
and Warner shares were down 50 cents to $56.
   Under the merger plan that would create Time-Warner Inc., the
world's largest communications concern, Time shareholders would get
a share in the new company for each share they own and Warner
shareholders would get 0.465 share of the new company for each
Warner share.
   Analysts have said Time has several options to fend off
Paramount, formerly called Gulf &amp; Western Inc. The options include
launching Time's own tender offer for Warner or turning the tables
on Paramount by making its own takeover bid for the uninvited suitor
in a so-called Pac Man defense.
   Besides the stock-swap provision in the agreement with Warner,
Time has several takeover defenses, including a ``poison-pill''
stock plan. The poison pill involves issuing new stock to existing
shareholders, thereby making a hostile takeover more expensive.
   The New York Times reported Friday that Time's board of directors
met Thursday to discuss the company's options. A Time spokesman did
not immediately return a reporter's call seeking further information
about the meeting.

<HEAD>City, Sears Meet Amid Reports Retailer Already Has Decided to Go</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The municipal government Friday pitched an
incentive package to Sears, Roebuck and Co. to try to keep the
retailer's 6,000-employee merchandise group from leaving town.
   Later, Mayor Richard M. Daley said Chicago's assets should be
reason enough for Sears to stay. The comments came the same day two
city newspapers reported Sears already has decided to move the bulk
of the group's workers elsewhere.
   Varying estimates have put the value of the city-state incentive
package, which includes land near O'Hare International Airport, a
tax abatement and site improvements, at between $100 million and
$200 million
   ``You have to be optimistic when you look at Chicago,'' Daley
said, listing the city's lakefront, schools, churches and hospitals
as advantages few cities could match. ``We have a quality of life
equal to any other part of the country.''
   But he said he was concerned Sears might refuse the incentive
package put together by the city and the state and accept a
lucrative offer from another municipality.
   Dallas and Charlotte and Raleigh, N.C., have been mentioned most
frequently as Chicago's chief competitors.
   After a meeting between Sears and city officials, Sears
spokeswoman Kathy Gucfa denied any decision had been made about
relocation.
   ``They gave us some more information about the site, about
transportation and a host of other details,'' she said. ``Our
position is the same as it has been all along. We will announce the
decision sometime this month.''
   The relocation of the merchandise group comes as part of a
restructuring plan announced by Sears earlier this year.
   In addition to cost-cutting, Sears has shifted its retailing
strategy to include brand-name products, specialty stores and an
everyday low-pricing policy.
   The company also put its landmark Sears Tower, the world's
tallest building, up for sale and plans to move the merchandise
employees out of the office complex over four years.
   The Chicago Sun-Times quoted sources as saying Monday was the
deadline for proposals to buy the property, and that potential
buyers of the building, valued at between $900 million and $1.4
billion, included sports and real estate tycoon Edward DeBartolo and
press magnate Robert Maxwell.
   The paper said Sears will announce next week that 4,000 employees
will be transferred to either North Carolina or Texas, with the
remaining 2,000 jobs staying in Chicago. But those 2,000 jobs will
be phased out gradually, a source said.
   The Chicago Tribune, meanwhile, suggested Sears may be thinking
about breaking up the merchandise group and moving parts of it
around the country.
   One source said apparel-related workers would be relocated in New
York and furniture-related workers in North Carolina, while hardware
and appliance workers would stay in Chicago.

<HEAD>Eastern Creditors Committee Supports Buyout Offer, Union Leader Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN WINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Eastern Airlines union leader told a rally of
striking workers Friday that a committee representing the carrier's
major creditors has confidence in a Chicago businessman's buyout
plan.
   The comments by Machinists spokesman Charles Bryan contrasted
with a federal bankruptcy judge's ruling Monday that the court no
longer would consider an offer by commodities trader Joseph Ritchie
unless it was acceptable to Eastern.
   Company spokesman Robin Matell on Friday repeated Eastern's
earlier statement that there no longer is a chance of making a deal
with Ritchie.
   Bryan said the creditors committee reacted favorably to Ritchie's
plan at a meeting he attended Monday in New York.
   ``The creditors committee has been rebuffing and ridiculing every
effort that has come forward, except last week,'' Bryan told the
rally. ``For the first time the creditors committee was thoroughly
impressed. They had a lot of confidence in it.''
   Bryan said the committee rejected Ritchie's bid, which is
supported by the unions, only because bankruptcy law gives Eastern
until early July to submit a reorganization plan.
   About 1,000 striking Machinists, pilots and flight attendants
attended the rally in a parking lot adjacent to Machinists
headquarters. Afterward they marched along a street that goes past
Eastern corporate headquarters.
   Pilots and flight attendants joined striking ground workers
represented by the Machinists in a walkout that started March 4 and
virtually grounded the airline. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection
from creditors five days later, and has since tried to rebuild as a
smaller company.
   The proposal presented Saturday by Ritchie's group included a
$100 million equity investment and $210 million in union wage
concessions.
   Bryan said negotiators representing Frank Lorenzo, chairman of
Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., requested ``$500 million cash and
$300 million on paper. So obviously what the Lorenzo people were
saying was, `Get lost.' They were not dealing in good faith, and
that's clear now to the court.''
   Eastern's Matell described Bryan's comments as ``absolute
nonsense. There is no basis whatsoever for those statements.''
   Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Monday said Eastern should
begin negotiating with creditors about the company's plan to sell
$1.8 billion in assets and reorganize.
   But Bryan and Henry Duffy, national president of the Air Line
Pilots Association, told the rally that Ritchie and his backers
still hope to buy Eastern.
   ``They are continuing very aggressively to pursue the
acquisition,'' Bryan said. ``They think they're getting stronger
each day in putting the transaction together.''
   Duffy predicted that the creditors committee will not approve
Eastern's reorganization plan.
   ``The orenzo plan overestimates revenue, underestimates expenses
and has the most fatal flaw of all _ it doesn't have any people,''
Duffy said to cheers from the crowd.

<TEXT>
   Paul A. Bilzerian, the high school dropout and
Vietnam veteran who rose to takeover strategist and Singer Co.
chairman, has a new though unwanted title: convicted felon.
   A federal court jury convicted of all counts in a tax and
securities fraud trial Friday.
   The jury took just eight hours over two days of deliberations to
reach its verdict _ despite Bilzerian's testimony in his own defense.
   The case was the first prosecution of a corporate raider using
information derived from the Ivan Boesky insider trading scandal
that broke in 1986.
   Defense lawyer Arthur Mathews, who said he planned to appeal,
contended that prejudicial rulings by the trial judge hurt the
defense case, especially concerning Bilzerian's testimony.
   But U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the verdict ``would suggest
that it was not something that the jury thought much of.''
   Bilzerian, 38, a Tampa, Fla., investor who won control of Singer
last year, was charged with breaking securities and tax laws and
making false statements in connection with three failed takeover
attempts, involving apparel maker Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., building
supplies maker H.H. Robertson &amp; Co. and Hammermill Paper Co., and
another transaction of Armco Inc. stock in 1985 and 1986.
   None of the charges involved Bilzerian's $1.06 billion takeover
of Singer, the Stamford, Conn. defense contractor.
   The key prosecution witness was Boyd L. Jefferies, founder of a
California brokerage that bears his name.
   Jefferies, who was implicated by Boesky and in turn implicated
Bilzerian, pleaded guilty to securities law violations in 1987.
   He has testified twice before at the stock manipulation trial of
GAF Corp. and one of its top executives. Both times the case ended
in a mistrial. It is to be re-tried again in November.
   Jefferies, who faces a maximum 10 years in prison, testified that
he agreed to help Bilzerian circumvent disclosure laws by letting
him park stock _ that is, conceal its true ownership _ with
Jefferies &amp; Co., allowing him to secretly accumulate large stock
positions in potential takeover targets.
   A Jefferies employee, Michael Landy, corroborated much of
Jefferies' testimony.
   In five days of testimony near the end of the six-week trial,
Bilzerian admitted supplying misleading information to the
Securities and Exchange Commission but explained his actions as
either inadvertent or mistaken interpretations of the law. He also
denied engaging in bogus securities trades to obtain illegal tax
losses.
   But jury foreman Paul O'Neill said the panel found both Jefferies
and Landy ``credible'' while to Bilzerian's testimony they gave
``not too much credibility, particularly where he disagreed with
Jefferies.''
