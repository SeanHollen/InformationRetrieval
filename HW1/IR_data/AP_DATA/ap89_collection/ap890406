   Terry Trippet has done his best to make
certain visitors to his world-famous Southfork Ranch can see
everything they believe Texas has to offer.
   He has installed a 183-foot-tall oil derrick.
   He has stocked lush pastures with a longhorn cattle and
championship racehorses.
   And as for a Texas millionaire?
   Well, he says, he just walks around the grounds as often as he
can.
   Trippet's ranch about 25 miles northeast of Dallas is the model
for the Ewing spread in the television series ``Dallas.''
   The ranch, with its stately white two-story ranchhouse and
immense outbuildings, is sometimes incorrectly placed in
neighboring towns. But Trippet prefers the townname of Southfork
Ranch, and he lets everyone know it's all his.
   ``I'm the mayor and I'm the city council and I'm the building
inspector,'' he says, wearing a sly grin that's shaded by a $3,000
cowboy hat. ``That's the only way I could have gotten all these
things built around here.''
   What was once a fairly nice country ranch is becoming an
international tourist attraction. Trippet says you can stand on any
part of the ranch and hear about 10 languages spoken in one hour.
It sounds like an idle boast until the next group of tourists
strolls by.
   A camera-snapping couple is from Germany. A young family with
two children is from Canada. And a woman who rolls into Trippet's
path and levels a camera lens at his head has a British accent.
   ``You look just like J.R., coming down there,'' she says, as she
shoots.
   He does resemble J.R. Ewing, who raises the ire and interest of
millions of TV fans worldwide. On this day, the tall Texan is
wearing a leather vest, western shirt, a pair of sharply pressed
jeans and ostrich-skin boots.
   Like J.R., the 44-year-old Trippet is fond of that disappearing
Texas pastime _ making money. And he made his through _ you guessed
it _ oil.
   ``You want to know the most expensive souvenir around here,'' he
says, then points at himself. ``Me _ that's what. And I'm not
cheap.''
   Trippet, who bought the ranch in 1984 for a ``very big'' price,
says if Southfork Ranch looks a bit commercial, that's because it's
meant to make money.
   From the $1.75 chili dogs to the ranchhouse, which he rents for
$2,500 a night for overnight visitors, the showplace is meant to be
a money-making proposition.
   ``Besides,'' he says. ``That $2,500 is nothing. A good penthouse
is going to cost you that much to rent. ...
   ``But anything you see here is for sale. You want to buy those
shrubs and I'll go dig them up myself.''
   His latest enterprise could be the start of something very big.
This Friday, Saturday and Sunday, Trippet is holding the Southfork
Antiques Spectacular.
   More than $3 million worth of antique furniture, chandeliers,
carpets and jewelry will be offered for sale. The auction will
include a Louis XV dining room transferred intact to Texas from a
Scottish castle. It's being offered by Priscilla Davis, a Fort
Worth socialite.
   For the occasion, Trippet is selling the contents of his
ranchhouse. He says he will then refill the house and sell all
those items at the next auction.
   As Trippet ambles back to the ranch office to check calls before
roaring off in a gold Mercedes, he doesn't miss a step when asked
about his favorite part of the ranch.
   ``My cash register,'' he says. ``And those tour buses parked
over there. I love to see those dollar bills walking in.''

   The diaper business has hit bottom, forcing
the last remaining diaper service in Berkshire County to call it
quits.
   Thomas Holzer, vice president of Aladco, said that with more
parents using disposable diapers his customers have dropped from
400 a decade ago to a mere 60 scattered across the county.
   ``We can't operate at that low a volume,'' he said Tuesday.
   Holzer said he had hoped negative publicity about disposable
diapers choking landfills would slow the trend, but that didn't
happen.
   Toward the end, he found that he couldn't even give away his
business.
   People declined, even when diaper service was offered as a gift,
Holzer said.
   And so, in May, the Adams company, which also operates a
laundry, dry cleaning and linen and uniform rental business, is
dropping its diaper division.

<TEXT>
   Sex Aid. Keep a little tin box by the bed, and
donate 25 pence every time, uh, you know, whenever you do. Wink
wink, nudge nudge.
   The campaign announced by Marie Stopes International, a charity
which supports family planning in the Third World, sounds like a
publicity stunt.
   It is a publicity stunt.
   Patricia Hindmarsh, fund-raising manager for the charity, said
Wednesday that it has been working away quietly for 20 years,
``talking earnestly to people _ and it hasn't done the trick.''
   ``We now realize that we need more hype like Band Aid and Comic
Relief to draw people's attention to the problem, so we are asking
people to make love and save the world.''
   At the suggested rate of 25 pence (43 cents), Ms. Hindmarsh said
the average British couple could give 12.50 pounds (about $21.25) a
year.
   ``They can save it up or write us a check every six months or
put it in a little tin by the bed,'' Ms. Hindmarsh said.
   ``We don't really care how they do it,'' she confessed. ``At the
end of the day we just want their money.''
   There is a serious point too: ``I think it will help people
focus on the fact that they have the freedom to make love without
producing another mouth to feed,'' she said.

<HEAD>Lenin's Body Still OK After 65 Years, Scientists Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of Vladimir I. Lenin still is
well-preserved after 65 years on lying in state in Red Square,
Pravda reported, and is in no immediate danger of decomposition.
   The Communist Party newspaper quoted Sergei S. Debov, head of
the laboratory overseeing the body, as confirming long speculation
that scientists at first did not think they could preserve the
remains of the Soviet founder, who died in 1924.
   He said they considered a refrigeration system, but instead
decided on ``anatomical-biochemical methods,'' the paper reported
Wednesday.
   Debov did not go into details on how the body is maintained, but
disclosed that the fight against decomposition was so intense at
first that scientists had to work around the clock to preserve it.
   He said the preservation process still requires ``daily vigilant
observation'' and that the body ``is guaranteed for an extended
period of time.''
   The body lies beneath glass in a special marble-and-granite
mausoleum in Red Square. Five days a week, visitors are hustled
past the body in a dimly lit room where no photographs are allowed.
   Mass demand that Lenin's body lie permanently displayed prompted
the Communist Party leadership to overrule Lenin's widow, Nadezhda
Krupskaya, who opposed having her husband embalmed.

<TEXT>
   A high school student was barred from some
school activities after he reportedly mouthed obscenities at
television cameras during President Bush's visit to the school.
   The student, 17-year-old Steve Petersheim, was in ``preferential
seating'' in bleachers behind the president at Conestoga Valley
High School on March 22, Principal Harry Wirth said.
   Some of his antics, which included blowing chewing-gum bubbles
and waving a ``Jackson in '92'' sign after Bush's anti-drug speech,
apparently were aired by at least one Philadelphia area television
station, Wirth said.
   ``In this situation he didn't know how to act,'' said the
principal, who decided to ban the senior from certain events.
   Wirth said the student had been barred from activities ``where
we can't control his behavior.'' Those include school assemblies,
the senior prom and graduation exercises.
   A school secretary logged several calls from television viewers
the day of the president's visit complaining about the student's
behavior, Wirth said.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The murderous bombardment in Beirut, the
worst in four years, has squeezed people's daily lives to four
hours of scurrying about their business and 20 hours underground.
   When Syrian and Christian artillery gunners rest at daybreak,
thousands of trapped residents cautiously emerge from bunkers.
   Their first order of business is to hurriedly buy fresh supplies
of food, water, candles, gas lamps, decks of cards and sleeping
pills.
   Just before the antagonists resume the deadly duel that began
three weeks ago, they rush back to shelters on both sides of the
Green Line that divides the city into Moslem and Christian sectors.
   Most nightclubs, bars, restaurants, cafes and movie houses are
closed. So are schools and universities. Banks operate haphazardly
for two or three hours a day, depending on the ferocity of the
shelling.
   ``The only thing that matters nowadays is self-preservation,''
said Amin Trad, a pharmacist in Christian East Beirut's Ashrafiyeh
district. ``Survival is the name of the game.''
   He did not recall a similar stampede for sleeping pills in
Lebanon's 14-year civil war.
   ``I don't have statistics. But if this continues, we will soon
run out of tranquilizers,'' said Trad, whose pharmacy is shielded
by tall sandbag walls.
   There are no severe shortages at present. Wholesalers try to
monopolize goods in order to raise prices, and stores order new
stock during lulls in the fighting.
   Some residents manage to joke about the shelling.
   ``Tell my friends in west Beirut not to worry about me,'' said
Bahjat Jaber, a police reporter who lives in east Beirut's
Maameltein suburb. Like many others, he commuted between Beirut's
two sectors before the latest round of fighting.
   ``I have all the fireworks. Some 200 shells explode around my
apartment nightly. The house is always shaking like a swing, and I
am swinging,'' quipped Jaber, 55.
   A Greek Catholic bachelor, Jaber does not use the basement
shelter of his seaside apartment building because his 92-year-old
mother can hardly move. ``I simply can't leave her alone.''
   When a missile detonated a large gas storage tank at Beirut
port, winds blew the flame and smoke in the direction of his house,
10 miles north of Beirut.
   ``I'm lik a roasted chicken,'' he joked to friends on the
telephone.
   The fighting pits army commander Gen. Mily
Christian units against an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse
Moslem militiamen.
   It was touched off by an air-and-sea blockade Aoun clamped on
militia-run illegal ports on March 6 in a bid to reinstate
government authority. Aoun heads a Christian Cabinet in the
fractured nation's dual government.
   The Syrians and Mosmilitia allies, who recognize the rival
Moslem Cbinet of former Prime Minister Salim Hoss, retaliated by
sealis to the Christian enclave and blockading
its 1 million inhabitts with their bato the sea.
   Ensuing bouts of savage bombardment have blown 
hundreds of houses, wrecked power plants, destroyed city water
pipes and threatened to crush the nation's infrstructure.
   Police statistics show an average of 3,000 shells fell on the
city and its environs every day of the past three weeks, killing
more than 150 people and wounding 500.
   Mor than 90 have been killed and 300 wounded in easnd
the adjoining Christian hinterland. The other casulaties were in
the city's Moslem sector and Druse-controlled hills.
   Nabil Haddad, 38, a Christian grcer, said he has been surviving
with his wife aong with 40 neighbors in the
candle-lit basement of their 6-story apartment building.
   ``I death so close. I give up,'' he said at the doorstep
of their shelter in east Beirut's poor Einrict.
``We're suffocating. I don't think we're e.''
   Haddad opens his store only during morning lulls in shelling.
   Shukri Lahhoud, a banker who lives  posh, hilltop Rabieh
district on east Beirut's northern flank, was more optimistic.
   ``We'to make it,'' he said. ``I don't think the world
is going to al the annihilation of 1 million Christians. Thisng to stop.''
   Lahhoud said he and his neighbors while away the hours in
running games of poker and backgamloor
underground shelter, which houses a power generator.
   The city's Moslem sector is virtually a ghost town. Tens of
thousands of residents have fled to relative safety in east and
south Lebanon.
   Those who stayed behind also spend nights in shelters as
soldiers with multibarreled mobile rocket launchers roam around,
firing off a barrage, then moving quickly before retaliatory fire
comes. Civilians take the punishment.
   ``It's a dirty trick but no one dares protest it,'' ident who requested
anonymity.

<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old girl who says she
broke under the strain of daily baby-sitting was indicted as an
adult Wednesday for allegedly killing her 2-year-old half brother
and beating her 15-month-old half sister.
   After two hours of deliberations, a Broward County grand jury
indicted fifth-grader Arva Betts on adult charges of second-degree
murder and aggravated child abuse.
   Investigators were initially baffled on March 14 when they found
2-year-old Andrew Caesar strangled to death and his 15-month-old
half sister Tiffany severely beaten and strangled, but still alive.
   Two days later, the suspect, who was 11 at the time, was brought
into custody. Police said the child confessed to the strangling and
beating, saying she was overwhelmed by the responsibility of
baby-sitting every day from the time she got home from school
untill 11 p.m., when her mother returned from work.
   Arva did not testify before the the grand jury despite the
panel's invitation to appear on her own behalf, said Broward State
Attorney's spokesman David Casey.
   Second-degree murder carries a maximum penalty of life in
prison. The maximum penalty for aggravated child abuse is 15 years.

<TEXT>
   The assistant district attorney who led the fight
to keep ``The Thin Blue Line'' defendant Randall Dale Adams behind
bars was fired Wednesday.
   Winfield Scott was dismissed for violating policies, Dallas
County District Attorney John Vance said. Scott was the third
prosecutor involved in the case to leave the office this week.
   Scott did not return repeated calls from The Associated Press.
Other officials at the office declined comment.
   Over Scott's objections, Adams was released from prison March
22, a few weeks after a state court overturned his conviction for
the 1976 slaying of a Dallas policeman. Adams had spent more than
12 years in prison.
   The case was examined in Errol Morris' 1988 documentary, ``The
Thin Blue Line,'' which questioned evidence in the case.
   Scott, who served as an assistant district attorney in Dallas
for 21 years, participated in the original prosecution of Adams.
   Adams was ordered released after the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals said evidence had been suppressed and at least two
witnesses lied on the stand.
   In fighting Adams' release, Scott said state District Court
Judge Larry Baraka and eight of the nine appellate judges were
biased in Adams' favor. He asked that Baraka be removed from the
case.
   Scott's arguments held up Adams' release for one night before
another state judge ruled in Adams' favor.
   The day after Adams' release, Vance said evidence to retry him
was lacking, and the murder charge was dropped.
   Vance said he'd investigate Scott's behavior as a personnel
matter.
   In his remarks Wednesday night, Vance said he had nothing but
admiration and respect for Scott. ``I found we had a conflict
regarding current office policies that simply could not be resolved
any other way,'' Vance said.
   Earlier this week, John Creuzot and Leslie McFarlane resigned.
Both had been with the office about six years and worked on Adams'
case.
   Neither would specify their reasons for resigning, but said they
planned to go into private practice.

<HEAD>Shoreham Nuclear Power Plant A Step Closer To Dismantling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH EDWARDSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's Public Service Commission on
Wednesday approved an agreement allowing the state to buy the $5.4
billion Shoreham nuclear power plant for $1 and dismantle it.
   In approving the deal, worked out earlier this year by Gov.
Mario Cuomo and officials of the Long Island Lighting Co., which
owns the plant, the commission authorized rate increases that could
result in New York's Long Island residents paying the highest
electric rates in the nation.
   The panel made permanent a 5.4 percent rate increase granted
earlier this year, approved a 5 percent rate increase to go into
effect in December, and authorized another 5 percent increase for
December 1990.
   The agreement to close Shoreham still must be be approved by the
New York Power Authority and the Long Island Power Authority by
April 15. Then it is subject to approval by the utility's
shareholders and board of directors.
   The higher rates would give Long Island Lighting a shot at
regaining the financial stability it lost in recent years because
of the burdens imposed on it by the ill-fated Shoreham project.
   Public Service Commission members, who approved an earlier
agreement worked out by Cuomo and the utility only to the see that
deal die because of state legislators' refusal to approve it, said
they hoped they were putting the controversial plant behind them.

   A Hungarian television crew was barred
from traveling through Romania to the Soviet Union, the state news

   Relations are strained between the Warsaw Pact neighbors over
Romania's alleged discrimination against its 1.7 million ethnic

   MTI said Wednesday that the four-man crew from state television

Romania.
   Alajos Chrudinak, leader of the crew, reportedly said that he
and the others waited for more than an hour Tuesday at the Romanian

   MTI reported that border station commander Maj. Gavril Ardelanu

department were not welcome because of TV programs criticizing
Romanian policy.

<HEAD>Adopted Baron Misses Deadline For Keeping Castle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FERRYSBURG, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There was no happy ending to the fairy
tale-like life that Richard Hemmelsbach has lived since being
adopted last summer by a childless West German baron.
   On Wednesday, Hemmelsbach missed a bank's deadline for coming up
with $3 million to keep the baron's 1,429-year-old castle in the
family. The West German bank that has a lien on the 150-room castle
and 970-acre estate plans to put the property up for sale.
   As the adopted son of 76-year-old Baron Freiherr Theodore
vonLiebieg, Hemmelsbach stood to inherit the castle and surrounding
vineyards on the Mosel River at the foot of the Eifel Mountains in
southwestern West Germany.
   The value of the castle and estate is estimated at $10 million.
   But Hemmelsbach said he has something more important than a
castle.
   ``I still have this wonderful birthright and a wonderful father
and I plan to be a good baron and good son,'' Hemmelsbach said
Wednesday. ``I think we're all disappointed, but the baron has
never asked about the castle. He only wants to know when I am
coming back to visit.''
   VonLiebieg selected Hemmelsbach, in part because of his German
heritage, from more than 10,000 people worldwide who responded to
the baron's televised plea for an heir on the syndicated show ``A
Current Affair'' last June.
   Hemmelsbach didn't know at the time that he would be asked to
save the family's deteriorating estate, which was taken over by the
bank when a German businessman who had purchased the castle from
vonLiebieg defaulted on a loan.
   The baron has not lived in the castle for more than a dozen
years. He lives with his wife in a nearby villa.
   Hemmelsbach, a 57-year-old businessman, said he will continue to
work to purchase the castle for as long as it remains for sale, but
about 18 private and corporate investors, including a German hotel
chain have lined up to purchase the estate from the bank.
   ``I've been a rainbow chaser all my life,'' said Hemmelsbach,
who lives in the Lake Michigan town of Ferrysburg. ``I guess I'll
always continue to do that _ I'm too old to do otherwise.''

   The Duchess of York said eating
veggies helped her lose weight, and she made the revelation in, of
all places, a chocolate factory filled with temptation.
   The 29-year-old wife of Prince Andrew, who in August gave birth
to their first child, Princess Beatrice, said losing weight has
been a nightmare.
   The staff at the Cadbury chocolate plant in Birmingham had
praised the duchess for the weight she had lost.
   ``I eat raw vegetables _ lots of raw vegetables. I am still
trying but it is very hard,'' the former Sarah Ferguson said.
   Confronted with wall-to-wall chocolates during her five-hour
visit to the factory, the duchess refused to give in to temptation.
She did take home a box of cream eggs and some handmade chocolates
called Royal Household.
   Royal aides refused to speculate on who would eat them.

   Cartoonist Gary Larson has drawn his
first album cover _ for jazz guitar legend Herb Ellis, who paid for
the art with a few music lessons.
   ``I've drawn so many `Far Side' cartoons while listening to Herb
Ellis ... that I probably owe him a credit line on most of my work
_ let alone a cover,'' Larson wrote in a note on the ``Doggin'
Around'' album.
   Released Wednesday by independent Concord Records, the album has
a cover showing the inside of a nightclub called ``The Stuffed
Cat.'' Inside, upright-standing dogs, common characters in Larson's
wacky cartoons, are being served drinks by poodle waitresses and
listening to two dog musicians on stage.
   On the tables, a sign reads: ``Please keep table barking to a
minimum.'' A sign with a fireplug and an arrow hangs on one wall.
   Larson agreed to do the cover if Ellis offered to teach him a
few tricks of the trade, said company spokeswoman Merrilee Trost.
The record company, 45 miles east of San Francisco, flew Larson to
Ellis' home in Fairfield Bay, Ark., where the two spent two weeks
playing together.

   Rock 'n' roll promoter Bill Graham won a
major legal round when an appeals court threw out attempts to
revive a 22-year-old lawsuit over the management of the Jefferson
Airplane music group.
   The state Court of Appeal on Wednesday rejected arguments by
Matthew Katz that a lower court was wrong to dismiss Katz's 1967
case. Katz contended that Graham had agreed to an indefinite
extension to bring the case to trial.
   The issue involved Katz's claim that Graham had improperly
replaced Katz as manager of the group. Katz alleged inducement of
breach of contract and improper interference.
   After a 1975 trial to determine the status of the contracts, the
court set a second phase of the trial for 1979. That phase
continued with an open end while Katz and Graham tried to settle
damage issues.
   The damage talks were unsuccessful and the action was dismissed
in 1987.
   Members of the Airplane, which had its heyday in the late '60s
and early 70s, are considear to record an
album.

<HEAD>Cigarette Smoking Boosts Metabolism, Burns 100 Calories a Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Smoking makes the body burn more calories,
according to a study that helps explain one of life's biological
injustices: why people put on weight when they give up cigarettes.
   The research publi care of about 100 calories a day for the
typical smoker.
   Smokers typically weigh five to 10 pounds less than non-smokers,
and they usually put on that much weight when they break the habit.
The question has been why this happens.
   Part of the reason is that folks often eat more when they stop
smoking, and some studies have shown they are more likely to crave
sugar. While preliminary evidence suggested that they also burned
calories more slowly, many experts thought this effect was small.
   In the past, scientists have studied this by watching changes in
metabolism when people smoke while sitting still. In the lastest
work, researchers decided to see what happened to metabolism when
people smoked while moving around, just as they do in real lifeought it
was conceivable we wouldn't see any effect,''
said Dr. Kenneth A. Perkins, who directed the Universityrgh School of Medicine
study that's published in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   ``To our surprise, whe opposite, that it was much more
enhanced. It reversed our thinking. The implication is that the
metabolic eing) is much more important than everyone
else has considered.'   When staying ng increases metabolism by about 5
percent. But it raises it by about 12
percent. Among other things, this could help explain hy some
people balloon when they quit cigaretteothers manage to
hold their weight steady.
   ``If people tenn coffee breaks
or while relaxing at home watching TV, they won't gain as much
weight'' when they quit, said Perkins. ``Those who smoke while
active are likely to be thinnero begin with because of their
smoking.'' So they risk putting on more when they stop smoking.
. Nancy A. Rigotti of Harvard
noted that some people, especiall keep smoking because they
are afraid of gaining weight.
   ``Until our cultural obsession wih slenderness abates,'' she
wrote, ``we must pay more attention to the way weight gain impedes
efforts to stop smoking if we are to continue the progress of the
past quarter century toward a smoke-free society.''
   Exprts note that while obesity is dangerous, smokers should not
leof gaining weight keep them
from quitting.
   ``Your health risk is immeasurably improved whestop
smoking, no matter how much weight you gain,'' said Perkins.
   He also pointed out that people can offset their newly slowed
metabolisttle extra exercise.
   ``All you would need to do is walk about a mile extra er that,'' Perkins
said. ``That' hard as it sounds.''

<HEAD>Glitter, Elegance of White House Past is Displayed at Smithsonian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nearly forgotten mantelpiece that formed
the backdrop for Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous ``fireside chats''
is the surprise feature of a new Smithsonian exhibition recreating
the glitter and elegance of the White House in a bygone era.
   The permanent installation in the National Museum of American
History, entitled ``The Ceremonial Court,'' shows the front hallway
of the White House as it appeared from a 1903 restoration until
1952.
   The 1903 restoration, conducted by New York architect Charles
Follen McKim, took six months and cost about $500,000.
   The Smithsonian display required more than four years of
planning and eight months to install, at a cost of nearly $1
million. The project was underwritten largely by a grant from
Sears, Roebuck and Co.
   ``This is a permanent statement of the highest and most elegant
reaches of American craftsmanship,'' said museum director Roger G.
Kennedy.
   The White House, he said, represented ``a courtly life, a life
of high style. It's always opening night at court ... the night for
grand occasions, for getting out the very best china.''
   Among the items in the exhibition, which opens today, is the
mantelpiece from the fireplace in the Diplomatic Reception Room
that was the scene of FDR's radio broadcasts to a Depression-weary
public in the 1930s.
   When Roosevelt's successor, Harry S. Truman, undertook a major
renovation of the White House in 1952, the mantelpiece and other
unwanted objects were donated to the Smithsonian, which crated them
for storage in its sprawling warehouses in suburban Suitland, Md.
   There the mantelpiece gathered dust, its existence recorded only
on a Smithsonian catalog card, until the pile of crates marked
``White House'' was discovered nearly 30 years later by J. Michael
Carrigan, the museum's newly appointed assistant director for
exhibits.
   In that moment, Carrigan envisioned a permanent museum
exhibition of historic White House treasures drawn from the
Smithsonian's vast collections. The centerpiece of the resulting
display is a recreation of the front hallway, stretching from the
East Room to the State Dining Room, as it appeared beginning with
Theodore Roosevelt's presidency.
   While the hallway reflects the formal, chandeliered elegance of
the turn-of-the-century White House, there are hints of the
boisterous Teddy Roosevelt household.
   Just outside a trompe l'oeil painting of the State Dining Room
is the family elevator. Inside is a mannequin of one of Roosevelt's
six children with their pet pony, Algonquin, which once was
smuggto greet a bedrivelt.
   At the other end of the hall is a second trompe l'oeil painting
of the main stairway, with Archie and brother Kermit playing at the
bottom with a paint set and their pet macaw, one of a menagerie
that also included three rats, a terrier, a kitten, a flying
squirrel and a green snake named Emily Spinach.
   Among the objects in adjoining rooms is a gold Steinway grand
piano that was donated to the White House in 1930 and used until
1939. The piano, still being restored by Smithsonian conservators,
was richly decorated brtist Thomas W. Dewing with an allegorical
painting, acanthus garlands and scrollwork.
   The exhibit features cases of White House children's dolls and
toys, inaugural gowns worn by first ladies since Jacqueline Kennedy
and White House china and silver used by first families sinceeorge and
Martha Washington.
   Presidential leisure-time memorabilia on display include
Washington's leather dispatch case and English-made telescope, a
chess set used by John Quincy Adams, Warren Hardin
and balls monogrammed ``WGH,'' Chester Arthur's silver cigar
cutter, Ulysses Grant's well-chewed Meerschaum pipe and a life
preserver from John F. Kennedy's yacht, ``Honey Fitz.''

   A dead rat might not be worth a rat's
whisker in Lapeer County soon, or even the 10-cent bounty allowed
by an obscure state law.
   The 1915 law provides the bounty to anyone who kills a rat and
turns it over in a state of ``good preservation'' to their
municipal clerk. The clerk is to burn the rat's head and authorize
payment through the county.
   But the law also allows county boards of commissioners to
rescind the bounty, a move that Lapeer County Clerk Mary Ellen
Thick said in a recent interview that she would welcome.
   ``I'm sure they have not done that, but we'll be doing that
soon,'' she said. ``It'll be presented to the Board of
Commissioners immediately.''
   The bounty law surfaced recently during the celebration of
Marathon Township's 150th anniversary of incorporation.
   Township Clerk Laura Ring recalled receiving an anonymous letter
in 1985 from a resident who said he had killed 76 rats and wanted
to know whether he had to cut off their heads before receiving his
$7.60 bounty.
   ``I went to the board meeting wearing surgical gloves that
month,'' Ring said. ``I actually had visions of a sack of rats
appearing on the front doorstep.''
   But the rat slayer never has come forward.
   Marathon Township, meanwhile, also has on its books a $5 bounty
for wolves, in effect since 1839.

   Want a stop sign of your very own? Tired of
replacing stolen traffic signs, this town has decided to put them
up for sale.
   ``If we made them available, people might chose to buy them
rather than requisition them at midnight,'' said Public Works
Superintendent John Sulik.
   Sulik blames teen-agers for the epidemic of disappearing signs.
Despite efforts to put them high enough to be out of reach, more
than 70 signs were stolen last year, costing the town more than
$3,000, he said.
   Sharon, located about 15 miles southwest of Boston, makes its
own street signs and will charge sign buyers $20 each. The town
buys its traffic signs from a Boston company and will sell the
popular stop signs for $27 and speed limit signs for $20, Sulik
said.
   Sulik took out an ad in a newspaper and plans to buy another in
the high school newspaper. So far, though, only one adult has
ordered a sign.

   The Bush administration, disappointed that
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is not withdrawing military support from
Nicaragua, is accusing the Soviet president of empty rhetoric
regarding Central American peace.
   ``While his words about not exporting revolution are welcomed,
they are not matched by deeds which would give those words
credence,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Wednesday, referring to Gorbachev's denunciation of the export of
revolution.
   Gorbachev's comments in his speech in Havana on Tuesday
conflicted with the policy of Cuban President Fidel Castro, who
supports the spread of revolutionary movements.
   But, in a written statement read by Fitzwater, the White House
called on Gorbachev to back up his statements about wanting
demilitarized peace zones in Central America, by discontinuing
military assistance to the leftist government of Nicaragua.
   ``Today, we call upon the Soviets to cut off their
half-billion-dollar annual military aid to Nicaragua. The Soviets
continue to pour arms into Nicaragua, a country whose army is
already larger than those of all their neighbors combined,'' he
said.
   Fitzwater said continued Soviet activity in Central America will
affect U.S.-Soviet relations, but declined to specify how the
administration might express its displesure.
   ``We've never made linkage threats,'' he said. ``But we have
always said these are the kinds of things that influence the
relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.''
   A day earlier, Fitzwater had said Soviet spokesman Gennady
Gerasimov's statements against the export of revolution appeared to
be a positive sign. But on Wednesday he was more resng, ``We can hold out
a little optimism on the basis of the
words,'' but that the administration is looking for deedsto back
them up.
   U.S. officials looked to the Soviet leader's visit to Cuba as an
opportunity for him to change direction in Central America. Bush
had written him urging Soviet withdrawal of military support from
the leftist Nicaraguan government, and a halt to Cuban and
Nicaraguan support for leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   But Gorbachev, in his Tuesday speech to the National Assembly in
Havana, said Moscow will not has support for Nicaragua as long United States
continues military assistance to other
governments in the region.
   Fitzwatert
comparable to the Soviet assistance because the U.S.-backed nations
``are not involved in subversion of their neighbors.''
   U.S. officials estimate the Soviets shipped more than $500
million in military aid last year to Nicaragua and gave Managua the
same amount in economic asse the United States has
bankrolled the Contra rebels fighting to oust the Sandinistas.
Bush's shift to a diplomatic course means U.S. aid to the Contras
is now non-military.
   U.S. aid to El Salvador this decade totals some $3.5 billion,
and the administration accuses the Soviets of supporting the
Salvadoran rebels through Cuba and Nicaragua. Critics of the
administration policy, meanwhile, cite widespreder the U.S.-backed regime.

<HEAD>New Rules Ban Conflict of Interest in Medical Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors participating in a major study of
treatment after coronary bypass surgery will be barred from owning
stock in the companies whose medicines are being tested, according
to guidelines released today.
   The rules are intended to prevent any conflict of interest that
might sway researchers when they analyze the results.
   Doctors who drew up the guidelines note that there are no widely
accepted standards to prevent conflicts of interest for scientists
doing research with products that have commercial value.
   ``We believe that a defined conflict-of-interest policy will
protect the integrity of the study and the credibility of
investigators as the trial is scrutinized by the scientific
community and the public,'' the organizers wrote.
   The rules were drawn up by Dr. Bernadine Healy of the Cleveland
Clinic Foundation and colleagues from the Montreal Health
Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, Baylor
College of Medicine, the University of Minnesota and the Maryland
Medical Research Institute.
   They were published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,
along with an editorial by its editor, Dr. Arnold S. Relman.
   ``These are laudable voluntary guidelines, which for the time
being other clinical investigators would do well to adopt,'' he
wrote.
   The seven-year, federally funded study is called the Post
Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Clinicial Trial. It will
examine the effects of drug therapy and cholesterol lowering for
people undergoing heart bypass surgery.
   During this surgery, doctors reroute blood around clogged heart
arteries. However, the detours often become plugged after a few
years, and the study is intended to see if treatment can keep this
from happening.
   The study will test drugs produced by three companies. According
to the new rules, all key researchers will be prohibited from
owning stock in the drug companies or working for them as paid
consultants. The ban also will extend to their spouses and
dependents.
   Authors of the rules note that the outcome of this study could
affect the care of millions of Americans undergoing bypass surgery.

   Polling places across the nation would close
at a uniform time in presidential elections under a plan on its way
to the Senate after winning House approval.
   The bill, approved 238-154 on Wednesday, is designed to reduce
the effect of outcome projections made hours before the polls close
in the Wet and in some late-closing states elsewhere.
   ``The importance of Western votes for president is being
diminished just because of where we live,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
declared.
   The measure has passed the House twice before only to languish
in the Senate, but lawmakers say Senate prospects are better this
year.
   The bill calls for closing times of 9 p.m. EST, 8 p.m. CST and 7
p.m. MST. In presidential election years only, the switch from
daylight-saving time to standard time in the Pacific time zone
would be postponed a maximum of two weeks. Polls there would close
at 7 p.m. PDT.
   Under the timetable, polling places would shut their doors
simultaneously, making it impossible for results from some states
to indicate a winner and influence turnout elsewhere.
   Only presidential years would be covered by the bill, which
would take effect in 1992 and would not apply to Alaska and Hawaii.
   The plan is designed to dovetail with a 1985 agreement under
which major television networks said they would voluntarily refrain
from projecting election results within a state until the polls
close there.
   It is unclear if local races are actually affected by early
projections. House Rules Committee Chairman Claude Pepper, D-Fla.,
however, said Tuesday that he believed the phenomenon may have
contributed to the 1980 defeat of Rep. Al Ullman, D-Ore., then
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
   Either way, lawmakers say voter frustration because of such
projections is basically unhealthy.
   ``It's unfair to either party that the East Coast would announce
the final result of an election to the West Coast before the final
votes are counted,'' Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn., told the House.
   The only critic of the bill to take the floor, Rep. William
Frenzel, R-Minn., described it as ``a Rube Goldberg device that
will louse up the states, cause them a great deal of confusion and
travail.''
   He said it actually could reduce turnout by shortening voting
hours on the West Coast and possibly prompting East Coast states to
open the polls at later hours than they do now.
   Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., the measure's sponsor, said studies have
shown an earlier poll closing will prompt voters to vote earlier
and thus the fear of a drop in turnout ``is simply not
substantiated by the facts.''
   The extension of daylight-saving time in the Pacific zone would
take place only in presidential election years. It would last for a
maximum of two weeks and apply to California, Washington, Oregon
and Nevada as well as the Idaho panhandle but not the rest of Idaho.

<HEAD>Study Links Low Cholesterol and High Blood Pressure with Strokes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The risk of bleeding strokes is significantly
higher than usual among men who have very low cholesterol levels
but high blood pressure, a study published today concludes.
   The research found that men with blood cholesterol levels under
160 were three times more likely than those with higher cholesterol
levels to suffer bleeding strokes. But this increase appeared to be
explained entirely by a substantially higher risk in those with
high blood pressure.
   The researchers said the findings should not be taken as an
excuse to stop trying to lower cholesterol to prevent heart disease.
   Of the 350,977 men studied, 3,986 had unusually low cholesterol
levels _ under 160 milligrams per deciliter of blood, and diastolic
blood pressures above 90, which is considered to be elevated. In
this group, there were nine bleeding strokes, a rate that works out
to 23 strokes for every 10,000 men.
   By comparison, among men with low cholesterol but low blood
pressure as well, there were just under two bleeding strokes per
10,000 people, the same as for all men with low blood pressure.
   The men with low cholesterol levels did not face any unusual
risk of strokes resulting from blood clots inside the brain. These
are more common than bleeding strokes.
   The men with low cholesterol also had a sharply lower risk of
dying from all kinds of cardiovascular disease. For those with
cholesterols between 140 and 160, there were 46 cardiovascular
deaths per 10,000 people, compared with 83 cardiovascular deaths
for the total group.
   The study was based on the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention
Trial. The latest analysis, by Dr. Hiroyasu Iso and colleagues at
the University of Minnesota, was published in today's New England
Journal of Medicine.
   ``Our findings should not be taken as a reason to defer the
establishment of programs to lower serum (blood) cholesterol levels
in the U.S. population in order to prevent coronary heart
disease,'' the researchers concluded.
   They speculated that very low cholesterol may weaken the walls
of arteries in the head, while high blood pressure makes them break.

<HEAD>Budget Talks Stuck on Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee says President Bush's insistence on cutting the capital
gains tax is a ``thorn in our negotiations'' as White House and
congressional bargainers try to complete a budget agreement.
   ``I think we're confused,'' Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said
Wednesday night, after a meeting with Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and
Budget.
   ``We're a room of good intentions,'' he said, but, ``there's a
difficult thorn in our negotiations and that's capital gains.''
   Brady and Darman have been meeting with key members of Congress
to craft a plan for meeting the goal of a $100 billion deficit in
fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1.
   About $28 billion in either new revenues or spending restraint
would be needed to meet that goal, according to White House
estimates.
   As part of the deficit reduction plan in his fiscal 1990 budget,
President Bush proposed cutting the tax rate on capital gains to 15
percent, about in half.
   The president contends the rate cut would raise about $4.8
billion in revenue. However, congressional estimates show the
reduction would be a big revenue loser in the long run and,
Democrats contend, the rich would benefit the most from the tax
break.
   Although his own budget included several billion dollars in tax
increases and new user fees, Bush contends those did not violate
his campaign pledge against any new taxes.
   With Democrats opposing the capital gains scheme, coming up with
a deficit-reduction plan has proven difficult since alternative tax
revenues or more spending cuts would be needed.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., the House Budget Committee
chairman, has proposed in the talks that half the deficit
reduction, about $14 billion, come from revenues _ a combination of
taxes, sales of government assets, and new user fees. Bush's
revenue proposals produced about the same amount, but included the
claimed capital gains influx.
   He said Wednesday that resolution of the tax issue is crucial to
the success of the talks.
   Rostenkowski said he was not discouraged, but it would be
difficult.
   ``We're going to continue to talk ... but I don't know that
we're going to meet any of the deadlines,'' he said.
   Congress has an April 15 deadline for completing the budget.
   Brady and Darman declined to comment on the specifics of the
meeting.
   ``It's just part of the budget process,'' Brady said. Asked if
he had brought something new to discuss, he said, ``I didn't bring
a thing.''

   An academician and a mass transit
administrator are President Bush's choices to become the respective
heads of the Federal Highway Administration and the Urban Mass
Transit Administration, sources say.
   The White House has told the Department of Transportation and
lawmakers that it intends to appoint Thomas Larson, 60, a professor
who was secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation
under former Gov. Dick Thornburgh, to run the FHWA, department and
congressional officials said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the White House has told the same lawmakers and DOT
officials that Brian Clymer, vice chairman of the Southeastern
Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, will be named administrator
of UMTA.
   Clymer, 41, an accountant in Swarthmore, is on the policy-making
board of SEPTA, which oversees buses, trolleys, subways and
commuter lines for an average daily ridership of 1.2 million
passengers in the five-county Philadelphia area.
   Larson was Pennsylvania transportation secretary for eight years
under Thornburgh, now the U.S. attorney general. Responsible for
the nation's fourth largest highway system, Larson oversaw an
agency with roughly 12,500 employees and a $3 billion annual budget.
   A favorite of Thornburgh's, Larson began a $1 billion bridge
repair program and used merit hiring and a goal-oriented management
style to try to rebuild a department scarred by scandal from the
administration of former Gov. Milton Shapp.
   Larson left state government with Thornburgh in 1986, and is now
a special assistant for economic affairs to the president of
Pennsylvania State University, where he had previously been a
faculty member and administrator for 17 years.
   Larson declined to comment on the federal post, and SEPTA
officials said Clymer was in a board meeting and unavailable for
comment.
   The highway administration monitors the federal aid program for
highway construction, administers a bridge replacement program, and
oversees safety programs. UMTA assists state and local governments
in improving mass transportation systems.
   FHWA and UMTA are the last two major federal transportation
posts to be filled. The announcement is expected within a week.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's call for an end to the
``export of revolution and counterrevolution'' to Latin America
disappointed U.S. analysts who were hoping for a stronger sign that
the Kremlin would curtail its military aid to Cuba.
   Bush administration officials, pursuing a more conciliatory
Central American policy than President Reagan, agreed with
congressional leaders last month not to seek military aid for the
Contra guerrillas of Nicaragua.
   They hoped that in response, Gorbachev would curtail the
estimated $6 billion in aid the Kremlin sends to Cuba, the $1
billion in Soviet aid to Nicaragua, and East bloc assistance to
leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
   ``While his words about not exporting revolution are welcome,
they are not matched by deeds which would give his words
credence,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday.
   Gorbachev, meeting in Havana with Cuban leader Fidel Castro,
scolded Western media for reporting a Cuban-Soviet rift and gave no
indication that the Kremlin would be cutting its aid to the
Caribbean island, estimated at about $6 billion a year.
   ``As in the past, the Soviet Union and Cuba have a common
approach to the key problems of international affairs,'' Gorbachev
said. ``The most immediate task is to solve so-called regional
conflicts.
   ``We are resolutely against any theories and doctrines
justifying the export of revolution or counterrevolution, and all
forms of interference in the affairs of sovereign nations,''
Gorbachev said.
   On Tuesday, Fitzwater had said that the United States would
welcome ``the reduction of Soviet military support in Nicaragua or
if they mean that Soviet surrogates would cease supporting''
insurgents in El Salvador.
   Instead, Gorbachev condemned American ``meddling in Afghan
affairs.'' The United States has been sending an estimated $500
million a year in covert aid to the anti-communist guerrillas of
Afghanistan, helping secure the negotiated withdrawal of Soviet
troops last February.
   Many Americans have engaged in ``wishful thinking,'' hoping that
Gorbachev would seek to ease economic problems at home by
curtailing aid to revolutionary movements abroad, particularly
Latin America, said Howard Wiarda, a political scientist at the
University of Massachusetts.
   But ``there is no evidence whatsoever that the Soviets have
started to reduce military aid to Nicaragua or to the rebels in El
Salvador,'' said Wiarda.
   Although Gorbachev may be pressuring Castro in private meetings
to tone down his revolutionary rhetoric, and may ultimately curtail
Soviet aid to leftist insurgencies, ``I think it unrealistic to
expect Gorbachev to change those policies quickly,'' said Wiarda.
   The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee applauded
Gorbachev's statement on the export of revolution, while at the
same time criticizing Castro's past policies.
   ``I hope Castro follows Gorbachev's advice,'' said Sen.
Claiborne Pell, D-R.I. ``Certainly, much of our trouble in Central
America comes from Cuban activities. If they can be closed down,
this will help peace to come to that troubled region.''
   A former Cuban diplomat now living in the United States, Juan
Benemelis, said American ``expectations were too high for this
meeting.''
   ``I think there is definitely conflict between Gorbachev and
Castro, but that it will take some time'' to become public, said
Benemelis, who worked in Africa for Castro before defecting in 1980.
   Benemelis has seen hints that Gorbachev will reduce aid to Cuba
as well as pressure Castro to curtail military interference in
other countries, but doesn't think the trend will become obvious
until both countries enter their next five-year economic period in
1991.
   ``Since Gorbachev took power, the Soviets have been asking the
Cubans to fulfill their annual trade agreements. Castro has had
problems, for example, filling his sugar quota. He has not been
doing it,'' he said.
   Castro, who opposes the type of political reforms Gorbachev is
pressing in the Soviet Union, said Tuesday that no such changes are
needed in Cuba.
   ``But if Soviet aid was reduced, Castro would face a political
crisis,'' said Benemelis.
   The Cuban leader, who has developed strong ties to the Soviet
military and intelligence agencies over the decades, may be biding
his time, hoping that conservatives in those organizations will
force Gorbachev from power, said Benemelis.
   ``Castro is betting on the opposition,'' said Benemelis.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Change in Law to Ease Soviet Emigrant Surge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Bush administration is seeking changes in
U.S. law to allow up to 150,000 Soviets to immigrate to this
country over the next five years after a flood of visa applications
caught the government off guard.
   The adminstration has been the target of criticism from Capitol
Hill for its tangled approach to the flood of applications, coming
primarily from Soviet Jews. More than 4,000 Jews were allowed to
leave the Soviet Union last month, the highest total in 10 years.
   For years, the administration has demanded that the Soviets
loosen their stranglehold on emigrant applications, but once the
flood began under Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, the exodus
appeared to overwhelm U.S. officials.
   In order to remedy the situation, the State Department announced
on Wednesday that the agency had sent legislation to Congress to
allow 30,000 immigrant visas per year over a period of five years
for those people ``whose admission would be in our foreign policy
interest,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher.
   While the spokesman said the primary beneficiaries of the new
legislation ``are likely to be Soviet citizens,'' the law could be
used for other nationalities.
   ``We're trying to make sure we take care of everybody from the
Soviet Union who wants to come in,'' Boucher said.
   But Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the House
Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, refugees and international
law, said the administration proposal doesn't deal adequately with
the problem of Soviet Jewish refugees.
   ``It creates an unprecedented `pick and choose' immigration
policy,'' Morrison said in a telephone interview. ``It allows the
president to choose people from different areas who are not
immigrants or refugees.''
   After his subcommittee holds a hearing today on Soviet refugees,
Morrison said, he plans to introduce legislation that would deal
with the Soviet Jewish refugee situation ``narrowly, expeditiously
and with adequate resources for resettlement.''
   INS Commissioner Alan Nelson says that in order to help clear up
the backlog of Soviet visa applicants in Moscow and Rome, he is
sending additional inspectors to both cities to help speed up the
processing.
   More than 19,000 Soviets are waiting to be interviewed at the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow for permission to enter the United States as
refugees, and another 7,000 are waiting in temporary quarters near
Rome.
   The current rate of Soviet applications has been running about
4,000 a month. At that rate, the allocated refugee slots were due
to run out shortly.
   Those being denied access under the refugee quotas were offered
parolee status, but that did not give them government funding, nor
did it allow the applicants to apply eventually for citizenship.
   Last summer, the backup problem was exacerbated by a change in
the Justice Department policy that ordered INS to determine refugee
status for Soviets case-by-case rather than as a group. That is
true for other refugee applicants.
   As a stop-gap measure, the State Department in January shifted
7,000 unused slots meant for Vietnamese refugees to accommodate the
Soviet overflow.
   Although some estimates project about 40,000 Soviet applicants
this year, the administration had budgeted for only half that
number.
   In a statement, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the
legislation was not specific to nationality in order to provide the
president with some ``flexibility'' in case he wanted to apply it
to another nation at some other point.
   He pointed out that the law could apply to Vietnamese people who
obtained exit visas from their homeland but do not qualify for
refugee status under current immigration law.
   All immigrants have to prove that they would not become a ward
of the state by showing that they had a job offer or some other
means of financial support, Boucher said.
   The new legislation does not contain any request for funding for
the additional immigrants, although the White House has requested
$100 million from Congress in supplemental funding for migration
and refugee assistance.
   Boucher said the administration also hoped that voluntary
agencies would be able to help make up the shortfall.
   As well, he added, ``We're hopeful that friends and relatives in
the United States would be able to provide such assistance.''

<HEAD>Death-Defying Dining Is Here _ Fugu Comes To America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American diners with a death wish can now risk
sushi-cide with fugu, a seafood delicacy that becomes the last
supper for 100 Japanese each year.
   The raw fish arrived in New York City last week, appearing on
the menus of seven Manhattan restaurants and making the United
States the only country outside Japan where fugu is found.
   But the man who brought the gourmet delight stateside promised
Wednesday this fugu couldn't hurt a fly, unlike the badly prepared
fugu that's fatal to half the people who eat it. Every year about
100 Japanese eat a fatal fugu meal.
   ``There is no danger at all,'' said a confident Nobuyoshi
Kuraoka, owner of Restaurant Nippon in midtown Manhattan. ``In the
50 years since the war, there is no single instance of poisoning
from the tiger puffer fish prepared by a licensed chef in the city
of Shimonoseki.''
   With that in mind, all 265 pounds of fugu flown frozen into John
F. Kennedy International Airport was prepared for delivery in that
Japanese city. Kuraoka stressed its safety, but tales of fugu past
provide another picture.
   Fugu has been a taste treat in Japan for more than 2,000 years.
There are 15 different kinds of fugu, all prepared from puffer
fish. If not properly cleaned, the fish can be fatal _ its
entrails, liver and ovaries contain the deadly toxin tetrodotoxin.
   The removal of the dangerous organs is handled by special chefs
in Japan with at least 13 years' experience.
   To insure smooth sailing with this first fugu shipment, Kuraoka
had a chef with 53 years experience, Sakae Hata of Shimonoseki,
handle inspection in Japan and upon arrival here.
   ``No other fish is treated as strictly as this fugu today.
Inspectors at Shimonoseki observed the whole process,'' said
Kuraoka.
   The go-ahead for importation was given in November 1988 after a
year of intense negotiations between the two countries, said Chris
Lecos of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
   Fugu now will be allowed into the United States up to three
times per year between September and March when the fish are in
season. Fugu had been on the FDA's automatic detention list for
eight years, Lecos said.
   The ban made Kuraoka a man with a mission: bringing fugu to this
country.
   ``I was asked by three or four food critics in New York to bring
it in, and by the Japanese people staying in New York,'' said
Kuraoka. ``They miss fugu so much.''
   Why would anyone miss raw fish that much?
   ``It has a very mysterious taste, profound and unforgettable,''
explained Kuraoka, who charges between $35 and $60 per person for a
fugu sashimi platter, $50 a plate for fugu hors d'oeuvres.
   His opinion was not exactly echoed by two women in the
restaurant who'd tried the dish and lived to tell about it.
   ``Bland,'' offered one. ``Somewhere between squid and fluke,''
said the other.
   Nevertheless, Kuraoka was confident fugu would find its place in
the American market.
   ``The tiger puffer fish is the best delicacy in Japan,'' he
said. ``It's a huge fish, a beautiful fish. This is our very best
and also our most expensive. ... I'm very happy and very proud.''

<HEAD>Air Jamaica Jet Seized With 3,600 Pounds of Pot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. Customs officials warned Jamaica to intensify
its anti-drug efforts after the agency seized an Air Jamaica
jetliner with nearly two tons of marijuana.
   ``Security procedures on Air Jamaica are dismal at best,''
Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan said Wednesday. ``We hope
(this) seizure will attract their attention.''
   Inspectors found 3,595 pounds of marijuana packed into two
unlisted containers in the cargo hold of the Airbus A-300 that had
flown from Kingston to Miami International Airport, Sheehan said.
   ``You could smell it from 50 feet away,'' he said. ``We just
cannot comprehend how the Jamaicans could not have discovered it,
and allowed it to leave the country.''
   Under U.S. law, the plane was seized and government-owned Air
Jamaica could be liable for a fine of $28.7 million. Impounded
aircraft usually are released after payment of a small percentage
of the penalty.
   Larger marijuana shipments have been intercepted on ships and
cargo planes, but Tuesday's seizure was the most within memory
aboard a scheduled commercial airliner, Sheehan said.
   As customs officials Wednesday were announcing that find, three
men carrying shoulder bags with a total of 60 pounds of pot were
nabbed on another Air Jamaica flight here, Sheehan said.
   George Heavey, customs regional director, said the plane seizure
marked the 130th time since 1980 that shipments were stopped on Air
Jamaica flights. Agents have intercepted a total of almost 9 tons
of the drug.
   ``Customs is very concerned that _ despite the rhetoric and the
propaganda that we've been receiving from Air Jamaica _ the
security is almost totally ineffective,'' Heavey said. ``We've got
to do more to stop the use of Air Jamaica aircraft as conveyances
to smuggle marijuana.''
   He said theency was particularly incensed that the two large
cargo containers were not not on the flight manifest.
   Inside the containers, agents found 88 cardboard boxes,
including 29 filled with clothes and the rest stuffed with
marijuana.
   Inspectors did not immediately grab the drug,owing it to be
picked up at the airport.
   They then followed a rental truck carrying the pot to south
Miami, stopping it and arresting the driver, William H. Muller of
Miami, after he appeared to be taking evasive maneuvers,
authorities said

<HEAD>Malaysian Legislature Enacts Law Against Eating Turtle Eggs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an anti-extinction effort, a
state legislature has enacted a law under which anyone caught with
the eggs of leatherback turtles can be fined up to $363 or
sentenced to six months in jail.
   Many Malaysians eat the eggs as a delicacy, believing they
increase sexual prowess.
   The law passed Wednesday by the Trengganu state assembly in
Kuala Trengganu, 180 miles northeast of Kuala Lumpur, says the only
lawful purpose for keeping the eggs is for hatching by the state
fisheries department.
   Abdul Rashid Ngah, chairman of the State Fisheries and
Agriculture Committee, said he proposed the law because the number
of leatherback turtles laying eggs in Rantau Abang, near Kuala
Trengganu, had declined to about 500 in recent years and measures
were needed to prevent their extinction.
   The turtles, measuring as much as five feet in diameter and
weighing up to 900 pounds, range the seas as far as Japan, the
Philippines and Australia but return to the beaches of Rantau Abang
each June to August to lay their eggs.
   Scientists say the turtles, which live as long as 100 years,
return each year to the exact beach where they were born to lay up
to 70 eggs.

   Donald Atwood, a General Motors Corp.
executive tapped for deputy defense secretary, is promising to sell
his more than $3 million in company stock to avoid any conflict of
interest.
   The vice chairman of the giant automaker also said Wednesday
that he took out an insurance policy to guarantee his GM pension
should the company fail, to protect against any suggestion he would
use his government office to protect the company for the sake of a
pension.
   ``This is way beyond what is remotely reasonable,'' Sen. Trent
Lott, R-Miss., member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said
in praise of Atwood's efforts.
   ``You've done an extraordinary thing,'' said Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. ``You've
probably gone overboard ... you've done it at a great expense to
yourself.''
   Atwood, 64, owns about $1.4 million in restricted GM stock
options and about $1.2 million in Class E common stock as well as
other types of common stock estimated at over $750,000, according
to congressional sources.
   In addition, Atwood owns between $5,000 to $15,000 in AT&amp;T stock
and between $50,000 to $100,000 in Exxon stock, the sources said.
Financial disclosure forms only require listing a range of assets.
   Atwood, a member of the board of directors of General Motors
since May 1987, made his unusual financial promises just one month
after the Senate rejected John Tower, President Bush's first choice
for defense secretary.
   Senators cited allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing
as well as the appearance of conflict of interest in voting against
Tower. The former Texas senator had received more than $1 million
in consulting fees from defense contractors after leaving
government service.
   The Senate later confirmed Bush's second nominee for defense
secretary, Rep. Dick Cheney of Wyoming.
   On the opening day of hearings, Levin and Richard Lugar, R-Ind.,
introduced Atwood to the Senate Armed Services Committee with Levin
noting that ``anybody who can master GM's bureaucracy has a
fighting chance at the Pentagon.''
   The panel's chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., indicated that
Atwood would likely win confirmation.
   Atwood has 90 days to sell his holdings but said he hoped to
receive an extension. When he accepted Bush's offer, Atwood said he
was told that Tower would be confirmed by the third week in January
and that he would win approval by the second week in Febary.
   ``Between the first week in February and now there has been a
gradual erosion in the stock market and a gradual erosion in auto
stock,'' Atwood said.
   On other issues, Atwood expressed his support for purchasing
commercial products if they are available at lower costs than those
manufactured by defense contractors.
   The nominee also told Nunn that the departmet's top defense
priorities are a national secur under way, the Pentagon's acquisition system
and the
ethics problems in the wake of the ``Ill Wind'' procurement scandal.
   ``We don't just issue a pamphlet (on ethics),'' Atwood said.
``We have to makee that they have the training.''

<HEAD>Housing Stock up, but Young Couples Face Price Crunch</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young couples still dream of home ownerhip,
but higher housing prices and delayed marriages mean a longer wait
for the reality.
   Couples in their 20s traditionally provide the population fuel
for growing house sales, but they are losing the ability to cover
down payments on starter homes, housing analyst F. John Devaney of
the Census Bureau said Wednesday.
   Between 1975 and 1985 the median income of couples in their 20s
rose 80 percent while housing prices climbed 125 percent, Devaney
reported in a new bureau analysis: ``Housing in America 1985-86.''
   The financial constraints on these young couples haven't
dampened the growth in housing much, it would seem, with the report
showing that the nation's housing stock grew twice as fast as the
population.
   Housing increased by 26 percent between the mid-1970s and 1985
while the population of the country grew by just 11 percent over
the same period, the Census study showed.
   Helping absorb the increase are the shrinkage in average
household size from 2.94 to 2.69 people during the decade _
requiring more homes for the same number of people _ and the number
of people investing in seasonal and recreational houses, Devaney
said.
   Devaney said the growth in housing prices is forcing young
couples to delay purchasing their first home.
   The starter, or first, home is usually the hardest for a couple
to make a down payment on, since the down payment on a subsequent
house usually can be obtained from the sale of the prior one.
   The median price of first homes rose from $27,100 in 1975 to
$61,000 1985, 125 percent, Devaney said. At the same time the
median income of married couples who rented a home climbed only 80
percent, from $12,300 to $22,200.
  Devaney explained in a telephone interview, is that
young couples who used to move from the reer to owner category in
their 20s are now delayransition into their 30s and later
because theynger qualify for the mortgage loans.
   In 1975 three-fourths of married couples aged 25 to 35 qualified
for an 80 percent mortgage, a figurel to less than half by
1985, the study found.
asically there is still the desire, is sort of in
our phyche in this country,'' to own a home, Devaney said. But
realization of that desire is being delayed, and Devaney said he
doesn't expect any sudden turnaround in this situation.
   At the same time demographic reports show that young people are
marrying later than they have in the past _ waiting until they've
completed their educations and launched careers _ and are also
postponing having children.
   In addition to the rise in recreational and seasonal housing,
Devaney noted that smaller households have taken up a large share
of the increase in total homes in the country.
   Divorce and separation, up sharply in recent years, turn one
household into two, he observed.
   In addition many elderly widows continue to maintain homes on
their own and the postponement of marriages by young people has led
meny of them to maintain smaller households
   ``One in 10 homeowner units is a woman living alone,'' Devaney
commented.
   Other findings from the nealysis included:
   _The median monthly housing costs for all Americans averaged
$355 in 1985, compared to $311 for blacks and $357 for Hispanics.
   _The proportions of income spent for housing were 28 percent for
renters, 21 percent for owners of mortgaged homes and 13 percent
for folks with homes that were not mortgaged.
   _The average size of new homes built in 1986 was 1,825 square
feet, up 300 sq feet from 20 years earlier.
   _The median age of housing in 1985 was 23 years.

   President Bush's $441 million package of
education programs is as appealing as ``motherhood,'' says one
Democratic supporter, but critics say it spends too little to
counter the problems in American schools.
   The most optimistic outlook on the Bush proposal came from its
chief Senate sponsor, Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas.
   ``It's a package one could hardly be against,'' she said Tuesday
after a Rose Garden ceremony at which Bush announced he was sending
it to Congress. Chances of passage are ``very good,'' said
Kassebaum the senior Republican on the Senate education
subcommittee.
   But there were some who found reason to grumble, among them Rep.
Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., and the 1.9-million-member National
Education Association.
 awkins, chairman of the House Education and Laboee,
called Bush's plan ``a futile response to the growing crisis in
American education.'' He sno future on Capitol Hill.''
   The Educational Excellence Act outlined by the president makes
good on many of his campaign promises, among them a $250 million
grant program to reward schols that have cut drug use or dropout
rates, raised test scores or improved in other ways.
   jor part of the package, proposed for fiscal 1990,
calls for spending $100 million on a new magchools program.
Schools would be encouraged to develop special with the objective of increasing
open enrollment and
parental choice.
   Other parts of the bill would reward outstanding teaience scholars,
develop new ways to certify teachers, help
drug-ridden urban schools and bolster the endowments of
historically black colleges.
   Critics zeroed in on its fiscal modesty.
   ``The fact that they can talk easily about raising $40 billion
to bail out savings and loans and we're nickel-and-diming on the
issue of children's education, talking ab0 million, is
ludicrous,'' said Ken Melley, chief lobbyist for the NEA.
   ``The fact is, if the education budget were to just enjoy the
cost of living increase that they give the defense budget, we would
have had another $900 million,'' he said.
   Some juggling in the budget proposal submitted by former
President Reagan and later embraced by Bush would allow modest
increases in several rams such as Chapter 1, which
bolsters basic skills of disadvantaged students.
   But critics say even those increases don't match inflation,aning schools
would have to cut back on services.
   Bush is ``attempting to strip programs long supported by
Congress to pay for new initiatives of questionable value,''
Hawkins charged. ``The Congress will not accept that lack of
commitment to educaion investment.''
   Not all Dmocrats were negative about the n.
   ``This is an excellent initiative,'' said Sen. Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., chairman of the education subcommittee, who attended
the Rose Garden announcemeo
``motherhood'' and said its chances of passage are ``pretty good.''
   Eduction officials said Wednesday thd enter budget
negotiations with Congress seeking $22.3 billion in fiscal 1990
spending author for their department _ the initial $21.9 billion
sought by Reagan plus $441 million for the Budition to the $250 million
for merit schools and $100
million for magnets, Bush is proposing:
   _$25 millionor grants to urban schools that have the most
serious drug problems.

<HEAD>Members of Congress Claim Ignorance of Foreign-Paid Travel Restrictions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of Congress who neglected to report
travel abroad paid for in part by foreign governments say they were
ignorant of the federal law requiring them to do so.
   Rep. Robin Tallon, D-S.C., who traveled to Australia and New
Zealand with three colleagues and their spouses last November said
he was ``absolutely unaware'' of the filing requirements under the
1978 Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act.
   He wasn't alone.
   ``If I didn't file, it was an oversight,'' said Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, chairman of a House agriculture subcommittee on
livestock, dairy and poultry and leader of the delegation that
spent 12 days in the two countries. Two of Stenholm's colleagues,
however, did complete the forms.
   The act was intended to prevent conflicts of interest by
ensuring disclosure of gifts from foreign governments, including
travel expenses.
   Other lawmakers who didn't fill out the forms also pledged to do
so if congressional ethics officials deem it necessary.
   The officials say they have no way of knowing how many members
of Congress fail to file the reports. Conviction of violating the
law could carry a civil penalty of $5,000 plus the cost of the
gift, but no member of Congress has been charged with failing to
file a proper foreign travel expense report.
   In 1988, two senators and eight House members filed travel
expense reports under the gifts act.
   Among those who didn't, at least at first:
   _Sens. James Exon, D-Neb.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa; and then-Sen. John Melcher, D-Mont. They and others
received transportation paid for by the governments of New Zealand
and Australia during a January 1988 congressional trip to those
countries.
   _Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, who spent one night at an
international conference in Potsdam, East Germany, last June.
   ``Since we never knew about it (the law), we never filled it
out,'' said Mark Bowen, Exon's spokesman. Exon subsequently
reported the travel expenses.
   ``I'm going to check with the appropriate Senate office and if
indeed it's determined that a report was not filed that should have
been filed, then we'll do that,'' said Don Foley, Harkin's
administrative assistant.
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Ethics, was the lone senator on the trip to the two
countries to disclose the travel expenses on a gifts and
decorations act form.
   Stenholm neglected to file even though he was advised by the
House ethics committee chairman, Rep. Julian Dixon, D-Calif., that
``the Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act ... requires that expenses
for travel provided by a foreign government be reported to the
committee within 30 days of departure from the donor country.''
   Dixon enclosed a copy of the form with the advice to Stenholm.
   Overseas expenses for the Stenholm delegation were paid by
Qantas Airways, the Australian government-owned airline, and
several private, quasi-private and foreign government entities,
such as the Australian Meat and Livestock Corp., the New Zealand
Wool Board and the New Zealand Meat Producers Board, Stenholm said.
   Bryan Yolles, an attorney with Clifford &amp; Warnke, the firm that
helped arrange the trip to Australia, said no foreign government
money was used in the trip. But House rules say funding by
``quasi-governmental'' organizations must be listed.
   The Institute for East-West Security Studies, a non-profit
research organization in New York, paid Cohen's travel expenses but
didn't tell him the East Germans were picking up expenses in the
country, said Kathy Gest, spokeswoman for Cohen.
   ``If we should have filled one out, we will,'' Gest said. ``It's
often not clear in situations like this,'' she said. Cohen's office
planned to check to see if his expenses exceeded the $100 that
triggers the filing requirement for the Senate. The House minimum
is $180.
   Rep. Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., who also attended the conference,
did file a gift form, estimating the value of lodging and meals for
three days at the Interhotel in Potsdam at $400.
   To ensure that senators are aware of the law, the Senate ethics
committee sent all members a copy of it, plus an explanation, in a
letter last November.
   In some cases, members of Congress or their aides apparently
filled out the forms unnecessarily.
   ``The confusion indicates to me ... it's not being enforced,''
said Bernard Wruble, a private attorney who formerly headed the
Office of Government Ethics. But he said public officials have an
``inescapable responsibility'' to know who is providing them with
something of significant value.

   Only rarely in this avowedly Marxist state does
anyone decide to run for office on a platform of free enterprise,
free expression and free emigration.
   Roberto Bahamonde did. He lost.
   The margin against Bahamonde was 2-1 but what makes him unique
was that he even tried. The place where Bahamonde, 53, made a bit
of history the other night was near his home in a rundown section
of eastern Havana called San Miguel de Padron.
   The 150 voters in that municipality had before them a classic
political choice: a Marxist-Leninst against what might be described
as an American-style liberal Democrat.
   This was a highly unusual occurrence in a country where Mar
orthodoxy is the national religion.
   What happened the night of March 21 provided some ins
how, after 30 years, Communist authorities have been skillfully
able to keep the Bahamondes of Cuba at bay.
rters of the revolution see it, opening the dooruld lead to the unraveling
of when Bahamonde
regards as the substantial gains made under President Fidel Castro,
particularly in social servic He wants to preserve those advances and add
what he believes
Cuba lacks most: freedom.
   In some countries _ Argentina and Chile of the 1970s are
examples _ renegades like mysteriously disappeared or
were shot outright.
   Here, he has been able to work, raise three children, se
son graduate from college and, with notable exceptions that have
left him understandably embitered, lead a reasonably stable
existence.
   believes Cuba needs change.
   Almost all critics of the syste, suffered
imprisonment because they trespasseds or simply
opted for silence.
   Almost nobody chooses to trto change things through the
electoral process. Bahamonde, an agricultural engineer, is an
exction.
   He has a number of gripes about the sallowed to be self-employed, that
press censorship should
end a with food rationing and that Cuba should allow es to compete with
the Communist Party.
   The points he wanted to make that Tuesday night
in March when he joined his neighbors for an elect state
assembly seat.
   On March 21, the Comrge of the
proceedings refused Bahamonde permission to read his platform. The
party stalwart st, according to standard procedures, voters
are permitted to spavor or against the candidates once
the nominating process is completed.
   The candidates themselves cannot campaign.
   The establishment candidate was Gerardo Aldama, a decorated
26-year veteran of the Interior Miniry who served in Angola. In a
country that honors citizens who sacrifice themselves for the
revolution, Aldama is a man of distinction.
   During a sometimes tense period in which Bahamonde's credentials
were discussed that evening, he found his controversial past
resurrected.
  d, after all, written a letter to Castro in 1971 calling
for a shift to material incentives for workers insteadrds _ meaning low
pay.
   He also ran afoul of the police in 1proselytyzing _
trying to convince fellow workers that the systeded
fundamental change.
   There also were allegations that he tried to leave the country
during the Mariel980 and that he even had made an
attempt on Castro's life.
  ahamonde rejects the latter allegations. He has a letter from avernment
official proving he never sought to emigrate.
   Stilrt 10 days after that issue was raised, he recalon.
   ``I responded that this was false,'' he said ``I never had any
intention of abandoningmy country.''
   The darkest pfor Bahamonde occurred in May 1975 when he
was detained for supposedly attempting to spread his anti-communistws.
   He was subjected, he cld, to eight electric shock treatments
on grounds that he was suffering from menurbances.
   If he has any such problem, it is not evident to the casual
observer. He projects a rational image.
   ``It took me a long time to recover, years,'' he said, referring
to the impact of the shock treatment.
   ``You lose your memory. You can't even remember people's names.
I thought I would even foget what I learned in the university.''
   Alld, he was detained 10 months after his arrest in1975. He
was held 19 days in 1971 and another 583.
   These problems dogged him last month when he launched his
candidacy. People wondered: Can anyone who has been in trouble with
the law be counted on to fulfill his duties in elective office?
   Whthe votes were counted, the answer was obviouslyThere
were 60 votes for Aldama, 31 for Bahamondd 59 abstensions.
   But Bahamonde felt vindicated. Those who abstained, he argued,
actually were his supportrs but were afraid to take a public stand
in th-of-hands vote. In a secret ballot, Bahamonde claims he
would have won hands down.
   Before dawn Tuesday, twthe election, Bahamonde was
hauled off by police shortly after  arrival of Mikhail S,
Gorbachev.
   Bahamondof dissidents who had planned to
take part in a demonstration to ask Gorbachev to pressure Castro
into bringinhe kind of reforms the Soviet leader has

   Rep. Mervyn Dymally was in France visiting
Zaire's president last September when the African leader suggested
Dymally travel to Zaire personally to investigate a human rights
matter on which members of Congress had expressed criticism.
   ``I said I didn't have any way to get there, and he said, `Why
don't you take Air Zaire,''' Dymally, D-Calif., said in an
interview.
   So the government of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko picked
up the tab for Dymally's two-day trip from Nice, France to Zaire,
via Belgium.
   Dymally was one of eight House members and two senators who
reported receiving travel expenses from foreign governments in
1988. At least a handful of others didn't report their expenses,
despite a federal law requiring such reports.
   A member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Dymally flew to
Kinshasa then traveled by ground transportation to visit opposition
leader Tshisekedi wa Mulumba. In May, 58 members of the U.S.
Congress had protested banishment of Tshisekedi to a remote
up-country area.
   But Dymally said he found the former interior minister living in
an apartment and driving a Mercedes. ``He'd been out partying the
night before,'' the congressman said.
   Tshisekedi was in internal exile between April and Sept. 17,
1988. He was released after Dymally's visit.
   Here are details of other trips taken by members of Congess on
which foreign governments paid expenses:
   _ Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., and his wife were flown from
Taipei, Taiwan, to Hong Kong at the expense of the Hong Kong
government. They stayed two nights. Frenzel said he discussed trade
and foreign policy issues with officials. Rep. Michael G. Oxley,
R-Ohio, took a similiar trip from Taiwan to Hong Kong, and Rep. Rod
Chandler, R-Wash., accepted a helicopter tour of Hong Kong, paid
for by the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office. All three filed
reports on the expenses.
   _ Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., was vacationing in New Zealand
when officials of that country's foreign ministry flew him and his
wife to Wellington, the capital, and then to Auckland. Downey said
he had dinner with Prime Minister David Lange, and discussed issues
such as nuclear arms control and the docking of American ships. He
filed a report.
   _ Reps. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas; Robin Tallon, D-S.C.; Roy
Rowland, D-Ga., and Jerry Huckaby, D-La., and their wives took a
12-day trip to Australia and New Zealand during which the
congressmen discussed international trade and export issues. The
trip was sponsored by ``private, quasi-private and foreign
government entitites,'' according to Stenholm.
   They included Qantas Airways, the Australian Meat and Livestock
Corp., the New Zealand Dairy Board, the New Zealand Wool Board and
the New Zealand Apple and Pear Marketing Board. Stenholm and Tallon
didn't file reports; Rowland and Huckaby did.
   _ Rep. Douglas Bereuter, R-Neb., and Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine, were guests of the East German government at a conference
on East-West security in Potsdam, East Germany, in June 1988. The
conference was arranged by the Institute for East-West Security
Studies, a non-profit group in New York. Jonathan Bach, an
institute spokesman, said the host country picked up the expenses.
Bereuter filed a report; Cohen didn't.
   _ Ses. James Exon, D-Neb.; Howell Heflin, D-Ala., Larry
Pressler, R-S.D.; Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and former Sen. John Melcher,
D-Mont., went on a U.S.-funded trip to Guam, the Philippines,
Australia and New Zealand in January.
   While in New Zealand, they traveled on a jet belonging to that
country, and were also provided transportation by the Australian
government, according to Heflin's spokesman, Tom McMahon. Heflin
filed a report; the others didn't.

   Share prices plunged Thursday on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange, while the U.S. dollar firmed against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
48.54 points to a record 33,360.79 on Wednesday, lost 365.01
points, or 1.1 percent, to finish trading at 32,995.78.
   The dollar closed at 132.15 yen, up 0.78 yen from the previous
day's 131.37-yen finish. The currency opened at 131.93 yen and
moved in a range of 131.75-132.25 yen.
   Traders said the dollar's rise followed overnight gains in New
York.
   Trading was slow as participants exercised caution ahead of the
announcement of the U.S. jobless rate Friday, said a dealer at a
commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The Nikkei had risen for the last seven trading days, gaining a
total of more than 1,800 points since March 28.
   ``Participants slowed their buying after the consecutive gains,
and some speculators are selling for profit-taking,'' said an
analyst with Nomura Securities in Tokyo.

   Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinski
says the new department doesn't plan to close any of its hospitals
but may change some of their assignments.
   All 172 veterans' hospitals ``cannot be all-purpose entities,''
Derwinski told the National Press Club on Wednesday.
   ``Logically, there has to be a degree of specialization,'' he
said.
   Veterans' hospitals already have scores of agreements for using
military hospitals and vice versa, and Derwinski said he hopes to
expand those. He did not directly answer when asked what he thought
of merging the veterans' and military hospital systems.
   ``We have, if anything, a shortage of facilities,'' Derwinski
said. He and other officials have said they expect that as the
nation's 27 million veterans age, many will retire to the Sunbelt,
putting pressure on veterans' facilities in those states.
   ``We have no intention whatsoever of closing any veterans'
medical facilities,'' Derwinski said.

   The Agriculture Department says 10 states will
share in a $2 million test program that will let low-income
families spend government coupons at farmers' markets.
   Participants must already be in the government's WIC program,
which provides special supplemental food for women, infants and
children.
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode, who oversees department food
and consumer services, said the project ``will test a concept
intended to improve the diets of women and children while also
helping farmers'' boost sales of fresh produce.
   Participating states and the federal grants for 1989 are
Connecticut, $164,800; Iowa, $264,600; Maryland, $52,200;
Massachusetts, $235,000; Michigan, $115,800; New York, $509,600;
Pennsylvania, $167,400; Texas, $416,800; Vermont, $40,800; and
Washington, $51,000.
   The project, which will operate during the growing and
harvesting season, was included in the Hunger Prevention Act of
1988 and was authorized for three years. The $2 million currently
available for 1989 will provide approximately 88,000 participants
with a federal benefit of about $20 for the year.

   Psychologists are consulting with
nationally recognized experts on disasters and tragedies to help
residents young and old cope with the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``The stress down there in Valdez is incredible,'' said Tom
Scott, director of the Southern Region Emergency Medical Services
Council.
   ``People need to be aware the stress is going to be affecting
them. They need to be aware that their stress is going to impact on
their children.''
   A 24-hour toll-free telephone line staffed by mental health
professionals to take calls from the distressed is being set up,
Scott said Wednesday. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration set up a similar line for its employees in the
aftermath of the space shuttle Challenger disaster.
   Among the most common feelings are hopelessness, helplessness
and worthlessness, he said.
   Scott has been consulting with Jeffrey Mitchell, a psychologist
at the Univerity of Maryland-Baltimore County known to police, fire
and medical services around the country as the founder of a process
known as critical incident stress debriefing.
   The process is designed to relieve the stress emergency service
personnel encounter in mass-casualty incidents and other crises.
   A variation of the process may be valuable to the Prince William
Sound communities devastated by the spill, Scott said.
   Mitchell has done similar work in other afflicted communities,
like Palm Bay, Fla., after a gunman shot up a shopping mall,
killing six people and wounding 10.
   Mitchell warned that the children in the Valdez area would be
among the first to show the stress.
   ``He said don't be surprised if children ask for cooking oil to
put in the bathtub, or out in the mud puddle,'' Scott said.
   Kansas psychologist Richard Gist, a leading disaster expert, was
scheduled to arrive in Valdez today, said Mark Johnson, state
coordinator of emergency services.
   ``Mental health (professionals) should plan on seeing problems
... for two to three years at least,'' Scott said. ``Probably
longer because of the total loss of lifestyle that may occur. The
loss of lifestyle is as important as loss of income.''
   Mitchell suggested to Scott that the effects on employment be
evaluated as quickly as possible. ``Those that will lose their
livelihood for the next year or two will need vocational
rehablitation, or it soon will have a negative impact on their
mental health,'' Scott said.
   In the interim, Scott said, the emphasis will be on education,
trying to describe the reactions that are normal in such a
situation and offering ways to deal with them.

<TEXT>
   President Najib's government declared
a cease-fire in its war against the U.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas
for Ramadan, the Islamic holy month of fasting.
   Najib said the unilateral cease-fire would begin at midnight
today. If the rebels refused to observe the sanctity of the fasting
month, he said, government troops would retaliate.
   It was at least the fourth cease-fire declared by Najib since
January 1987. The first truce was disregarded by both sides, and
the guerrillas ignored all subsequent calls.
   The latest cease-fire was broadcast Wednesday by the official
Kabul Radio.
   Earlier, guerrilla rockets slammed into downtown Kqabul, killing
six people and wounding 23, a government official said on condition
of anonymity. Kabul Radio said 10 people were killed and 39 wounded.
   On Tuesday, at least six people were killed and eight wounded by
rockets that hit residential neighborhoods.
   Meanwhile, a special security court convicted two Pakistanis of
spying. Sgt. Mohammad Ashraf was sentenced Wednesday to 18 years
imprisonment and Cpl. Mohammad Afzal was sentenced to 16 years.
   Ashraf, 35, and Afzal, 25, confessed to spying for Pakistani
intelligence agencies. Judge Obaid Sakhi said they could have been
sentenced to death but he and the other two judges hearing the case
had acceded to their requests for leniency.
   Sakhi said the sentences could be appealed.
   Ashraf and Afzal said they worked for Pakistani intelligence
agencies and were ``forcibly sent'' to Afghanistan by their
superior officers. Ashraf said he received a $1,000 bonus, while
Afzal said he was promised $200 upon his return.
   Pakistan has regularly denied sending any nationals into
Afghanistan.
   In Islamabad, a Pakistan Foreign Ministry official questioned
Wednesday whether the pair were Pakistanis, saying no proof of
their identity had been supplied to Pakistan's mission in Kabul.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Afghan government said the men were captured March 10 in
Kandahar province, which borders Pakistan.
   Most of the Afghan guerrillas are based in Pakistan.
   They have received support from the United States, China,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries in their decade-old war
against the Soviet Union's protege government in Kabul. The Red
Army ended its nine-year involvement in Afghanistan Feb. 15, but
Moscow is still supplying the Najib government.
   The rocket attacks on Kabul Tuesday and Wednesday were the
biggest attacks on the capital since March 14, when at least five
rockets hit the airport, injuring two people.
   Wednesday's rockets spewed shrapnel and debris as they hit a
small park next to the Kabul Hotel and a commercial district
several blocks away. The rockets, which landed four to 10 blocks
from the Foreign Ministry, were fired before noon, when sidewalks
and marketplaces are crowded with pedestrians.

<HEAD>Honduras Approves New U.S. Military Training Pact</HEAD>

   Lawmakers have agreed to let U.S.
military forces continue joint training exercises with Honduran
troops in this Central American country that borders Nicaragua and
El Salvador.
   In a separate action, the legislature also approved new measures
for cooperating with the United States to fight drug trafficking.
   The military exercises agreement was approved by a 132-2 vote on
Wednesday. The lawmakers who voted no said the measure could hurt
regional peace efforts.
   The two countries have engaged in more than 80 joint military
training exercises involving at least 60,000 U.S. and 20,000
Honduran troops during the past 38 years.
   The exercises were stepped up in 1982 when relations between
Honduras and the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua
deteriorated and the United States built an air base in Honduras.
   Honduras also has served as a refuge, training ground and
staging base for Nicaraguan rebels, about 11,000 of whom have lived
with their families in camps near the Nicaraguan border since the
U.S. government cut off military aid to them in February 1988.
   An estimated 1,100 American troops currently are stationed at
the Enrique Soto Cano U.S. Air Force Base, about 50 miles northeast
of Tegucigalpa.
   The base is considered among the most important centers of U.S.
military operations in Central America. Washington has been
supporting the government of El Salvador in its nine-year war
against leftist rebels.
   Under the drug agreement, Honduran officials said they will work
with the United States to crack down on drug production and
trafficking. Both nations are to share information and human and
technological resources.
   During the past six years, Honduras' Caribbean coast has become
a transfer point for drug shipments from Colombia to the United
States.
   In the most-publicized local case, reputed drug baron Juan Ramon
Matta returned home to Honduras in 1986 after escaping from a
Colombian prison.
   His arrest in April 1988 at his home in Tegucigalpa and rapid
deportation to the United States touched off riots. Extradition of
Hondurans is prohibited by the constitution.
   Matta remains jailed at the federal prison in Marion, Ill.,
serving a three-year sentence for escaping from a Florida prison in
1971.

   Princess Natasha Galitzine Romanov,
whose husband was a nephew of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, has
died. She was 82.
   She died March 28 in nearby Woodside.
   Her father was a doctor in Moscow when she was born. After the
Bolshevik Revolution, the family fled to China, then to Seattle and
eventually to Hollywood where she acted in silent films.
   Her roles included that of Josephine in a movie about Napoleon.
   ``But when talking films came, because of her deep voice and
heavy accent, she didn't continue,'' said Albert Bartridge, her
attorney.
   She met Prince Vasili Romanov in New York and they moved to
Woodside in the 1930s.
   According to Bartridge, the two helped gather much of the
collection on imperial Russia that is housed at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University.
   Survivors include her husband, their daughter, Marina Beadleston
of Aspen, Colo., and four grandchildren.
   A funeral service was held March 30 at the Russian Orthodox
Church of the Nativity of the Holy Virgin in Menlo Park. A memorial
service was held Wednesday.

<HEAD>Stocks Fall; Dollar Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index plunged
today, ending seven days of gains, while the dollar rose
substantially against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which rose 48.54 points to a
record high on Wednesday, shed 365.01 points, or 1.1 percent, to
finish trading at 32,995.78. It was the index's second-largest
decline this year, following a 366.21-point drop on March 20, when
it finished at 31,654.80.
   Stocks fell almost across the board as participants expressed
concern about the recent rapid rise in the Nikkei index, which had
gained more than 1,800 points since last Tuesday, said a dealer
with a major securities firm in Tokyo.
   Uncertainty over possible political instability caused by a
widening stock-profiteering scandal also discouraged participants,
the dealer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``The scandal has been continuing for some time, but speculators
are very concerned now about the situation,'' he said.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, whose party is under fire for
its links to Recruit Co., the information services conglomerate at
the center of the scandal, suffered a major blow Wednesday with
reports he had received $380,000 from the firm at fund-raising
parties in May 1987.
   In the scandal, the company reportedly sold hundreds of
thousands of unlisted shares of a real-estate subsidiary at
discount prices to about 150 influential public and business
figures. The recipients of the shares made substantial profits
after over-the-counter trading began and the stocks quickly rose in
value.
   Takeshita's public support ratings have plunged to about 10
percent and he now faces strong pressure from the political
opposition to resign.
   ``Investors' second-largest concern is inflation, which made
them either step off to the sidelines or sell issues because of the
upcoming release of the U.S. unemployment rate,'' the dealer said.
The U.S. jobless rate for March is to be announced Friday in
Washington.
   Inflation and subsequent interest rate hikes to slow the economy
could discourage stock investment.
   Trading was active, with volume on the first section estimated
at 1.1 billion shares, down from Wednesday's 1.8 billion shares.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 132.15 yen,
up 0.78 yen from Wednesday's 131.37-yen finish. The U.S. currency
started trading at 131.93 yen and ranged between 131.75 and 132.25
yen.
   A trader with Mitsubishi Bank said the dollar-yen exchange rate
changed little during the day as investors stayed on the sidelines
trying to avoid major moves ahead of the release of the U.S.
unemployment rate.
   ``Basically, the market has more demand for the dollar than the
yen, mainly because of the higher interest rates in the United
States,'' said the trader, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   For currency investors, higher U.S. interest rates make the
dollar more attractive than the yen.

   Two men trudged for six hours through
snow-covered forest to get help for three injured people after a
small plane crashed into a mountain in northern Quebec, killing the
pilot, authorities said.
   Searchers used snowmobiles to rescue the three who had remained
with the wrecked aircraft, witnesses said.
   ``As far as I'm concerned we had no choice but to press on
because we would have died if we didn't,'' said Marcel Rancourt,
who hiked more than six miles through thick woods to alert
authorities.
   Killed in the crash was pilot Michel Paquet, 34, of Quebec City,
said Quebec provincial police Sgt. Guy Viau.
   The aircraft, carrying the pilot and five passengers, all from
Quebec City, struck a mountain Tuesday morning in the Gaspe
Peninsula, authorities said.
   Rancourt, 36, and Emile Gilbert, 43, said they pulled the three
injured passengers from the wrecked aircraft, made a fire and then
decided to walk for help at about 3 p.m. Tuesday, according to
Canadian Press.
   After walking for six hours, they came to a house that happened
to be the home of Carleton Mayor of Denis Henry.
   Authorities were alerted and rescue crews, using snowmobiles,
found the other survivors early Wednesday and took them to a
hospital.
   Dr. Jean Matton, medical director of Baie des Chaleurs Hospital
in nearby Maria, said Robert Thibault, 35, was seriously injured in
the crash and was in stable condition.
   The other two passengers, Francine Lelievre, 30, and Guy
Tremblay, 35, were hospitalized for observation.
   Authorities had not determined the cause of the crash of the
chartered eight-seat Piper Apache, which went down about 250 miles
northeast of Quebec City.

   Mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo
and seven associates could become the nation's first Mafia members
to get the death penalty after being convicted of killing another
gangster, authorities said.
   A jury deliberated about three hours Wednesday before returning
guilty verdicts on murder, conspiracy and a weapons violation in
the 1985 slaying of Frank ``Frankie Flowers'' D'Alfonso, who failed
to show Scarfo proper respect.
   The conviction gave the 60-year-old Scarfo and his co-defendants
the prospect of execution or spending the rest of their lives in
prison.
   Scarfo, who heads the Phildadelphia-Southern New Jersey Mafia,
is already serving a 14-year sentence in a $1 million extortion
case and faces at least 40 more years in a federal racketeering
case.
   Common Pleas Court Jury members had said they could return the
death penalty if necessary. Assistant District Attorney Charles
Grant said he would seek that sentence on grounds the murder was
deliberate and premeditated.
   The jury was to begin hearing testimony in the penalty phase
this afternoon.
   No other U.S. Mafia member has been sentenced to death,
organized crime investigators say. One mobster, Louis ``Lepke''
Buchalter, was executed in the 1940s, but he led Murder Inc., a
group of mercenary hit men, not an Italian Mafia family.
   Robert F. Simone, Scarfo's lawyer, expressed concern about the
penalty phase in light of the jury's quick verdict.
   ``I don't think I'm going to get much sympathy from a jury that
didn't even want to deliberate a case that affects the lives of
eight people,'' Simone said.
   The defense lawyers said that they would file appeals within 30
days.
   The prosecution's case focused on two informants. One, Thomas
DelGiorno, has testified against Scarfo several times in the past
two years. He received a 20-year sentence for his role in the
D'Alfonso killing and other convictions.
   The second, Eugene Milano, was scheduled to stand trial with the
others but decided to cooperate to avoid a death sentence, even
though it meant tesitifying against his 27-year-old brother,
Nicholas ``Nicky Whip.'' Eugene Milano pleaded guilty to
third-degree murder.
   The defense attorneys branded the informants as liars.
   Attorney Joseph Santaguida, who represented 31-year-old
defendant Frank Narducci Jr., said the jury ``just couldn't have
examined the credibility of the witnesses so quickly, but obviously
they believed them.''
   After the jury foreman announced the first verdict, for
Narducci, Narducci's wife, Sandy, ran screaming from the courtroom.
   ``Stop it! Stop it! You should all die!'' Narducci's mother,
Adeline, yelled at the jury.
   ``Like my father died!'' D'Alfonso's daughter, Gina, shouted
back.
   Scarfo still faces charges in New Jersey with Nicholas ``Nick
the Blade'' Virgilio in the 1978 slaying of Somers Point Municipal
Court Judge Edwin H. Helfant.
   Besides Scarfo, Narducci and Nicholas Milano, the others
convicted were Joseph Ligambi, 48, and Narducci's 26-year-old
brother, Philip, who were identified as the shooters; Francis
``Faffy'' Iannarella, 32, accused of supplying the two murder guns;
Salvatore ``Chuckie'' Merlino, 47, and his brother Lawrence
``Yogi'' Merlino, 32.
   During the trial, which began March 17, the two informants
testified Scarfo gave the order to kill D'Alfonso because he lacked
respect and refused to share profits from illegal operations with
the mob. D'Alfonso was shot on a south Philadelphia street near his
home.

<HEAD>Black Leaders Say They Will Hold Daley to `Open Door' Promise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor-elect Richard M. Daley's promise that the
doors of his office would remain open to blacks was greeted with
guarded optimism by many of the political leaders who lost control
of City Hall.
   The promise highlighted Daley's Tuesday night victory speech. A
day later, acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer told reporters, ``You heard
him say it. We'll make sure he sticks to it.''
   Also helping hold Daley to his word, Sawyer said, is the
practical matter of having to face re-election in 1991.
   ``I'm sure he'll be extremely careful. They've got a short time.
You've got to have continuity in government. You can't just go in
there and clean out all the blacks,'' said Sawyer, who is black.
   Daley's victory over chief rival Timothy C. Evans, the lone
black in Tuesday's election, earned him the right to complete the
final two years of the late Harold Washington's second term.
   And Daley invoked the memory of Washington as well as his
political boss-father, the late Richard J. Daley, in promising that
``The City That Works'' will work first to unite an electorate
deeply divided along racial lines.
   ``The openness and fairness that the late Mayor Harold
Washington talked about will be in my administration in the city of
Chicago,'' said Daley, whose victory ended six years of black
political control in the nation's third-largest city.
   ``A mayor today has to bring people together from one end of
this city to the other,'' he added, ``to accomplish the things that
are necessary to give people a good quality of life.''
   During a round of interviews, the 46-year-old Daley said he
planned to leave soon for a brief vacation and would make few moves
until his transition team completed its report. His inauguration is
set for April 24 _ his 47th birthday.
   But before rushing off to attend to business that has stacked up
in his state's attorney's office during the four-month campaign, he
proposed several programs reminiscent of the shirt-sleeve
professionalism that earned Chicago, in his father's days, the
moniker of ``The City That Works.''
   ``I will bring out the best of my father _ he knew city
government,'' Daley said. ``He knew state and federal government.
He loved this city and worked very hard for this city and I'll try
to be like him.''
   Evans' most prominent supporter, Jesse Jackson, called for party
unity and for blacks to move beyond the rivalry between Sawyer and
Evans.
   ``The basic Harold Washington coalition has remained a bit too
divided and when we unite we will win,'' Jackson said, pointing
out, ``there are only 18 months before the next election.''
   Unofficial totals showed Daley finishing with 55 percent of the
vote, to 43 percent for Evans and 3 percent for Republican Edward
Vrdolyak.
   Daley was helped to victory Tuesday by overwhelming white
support, low black turnout, and clear majorities among liberal,
lakefront voters and Hispanics.

<HEAD>Her Secret Revealed: She's a Lover Of Skunk Smell</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ah, spring, with its warming breezes, budding
trees and luscious smell of skunk spray!
   Marilyn planned a day of traveling for her antique business
Wednesday and if luck was with her, there'd be a dead skunk by the
side of the road.
   Unfortunate for the skunk, of course, but what a wonderful smell.
   ``There's nothing like it in the world,'' said Marilyn, who
doesn't want her last name known by people who might think there's
something weird about her.
   In her 50 years, the suburban woman has had to endure the
solitary pleasure of reveling in the odor of skunk while getting
the fisheye from her husband, children, other relatives and friends.
   She wondered: Was there anyone else like her out there?
   In January, Marilyn ran an ad in USA Today's personal column:
   ``Calling All Skunk Lovers.
   ``My family and friends think I am the only person in the world
that likes the skunk scent. I would like to prove them wrong, so if
you or anyone you know likes the scent, please reply.''
   One response came from a woman in Nevada who apparently didn't
read the personal ad very carefully, since she offered Marilyn a
job in her brothel.
   But the 70 other letters were from people like Marilyn.
   ``My husband said I must be the only one in the world because
God couldn't possibly have made anyone like me since the smell is a
defense mechanism,'' said Marilyn.
   Ha! How wrong her husband can be.
   Listen to this letter from West Virginia:
   ``I can think of no combination of things using the five senses
that can rival ... the feel of a warm summer breeze, the taste of a
cool drink, the sights of a beautiful garden, the sound of rushing
water, and the faint smell of skunk.''
   Another writer said he never tries to hit a live skunk when he's
driving, ``but if a skunk lay dead, I might try to get a little on
the wheel.''
   Other writers called the musky scent ``sensuous'' and
``intriguingly delicate.''
   And what about this exclamation point-filled letter from
California:
   ``I've fed skunks before in Yosemite National Park! I once dated
a woman in 1980 who owned four skunks in New Mexico. We walked them
in the parks on long leashes, and they love to have their heads
scratched! Feel welcome to write me anytime! I'm 36, Italian, 5 ft.
10 _ 190 pds. brown eyes and wavy hair! I love a skunks scent!
Write back!''
   Actually, California presents a puzzle.
   ``Recently I've had the chance to wiff the West Coast California
skunk,'' wrote a transplanted Southerner, ``and I can tell you
truthfully it didn't do a thing for me.''
   Marilyn said she lived for 12 years in a semidesert area of
Southern California and never had the pleasure even once of getting
skunk scent.
   Otherwise, the 30,000 miles Marilyn and her husband travel
yearly in their antiques business have revealed no favorite
stretches of road for catching the odor, no sections of the country
that produce superior scents.
   ``It's all just wonderful,'' she said.

<HEAD>12-Year-Old To Be Tried As Adult in Brother's Strangulation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 12-year-old girl who told police
she was overwhelmed by her baby-sitting duties will be tried as an
adult in the strangling of her 2-year-old brother and choking of
her 15-month-old sister.
   A Broward County grand jury indicted fifth-grader Arva Betts as
an adult on charges of second-degree murder and aggravated child
abuse. The grand jury could have sent the case to juvenile court.
   Her lawyer said Arva's age and the fact that she had no history
of violent behavior and no criminal record should have supported a
juvenile charge.
   ``We're disappointed and shocked that the grand jury decided to
indict her,'' said attorney Johnny McCray Jr. ``There was little if
any evidence put on to support trying her as an adult.''
   Investigators were initially baffled when Arva's mother, Sally
Butterfield, woke up the morning of March 14 and found Andrew
Caesar dead and his sister, Tiffany Caesar, injured at their home
in nearby Wilton Manors.
   Arva, who was 11 years old at the time, was taken into custody
when it was determined that Andrew had been strangled.
   Police said the child confessed to the attack and said she was
overwhelmed by the responsibility of watching her half brother and
half sister from when she got home from school until 11 at night.
Her mother worked two jobs to support the family.
   Tiffany is hospitalized in critical condition at Memorial
Hospital in Hollywood. Doctors say she could be permanently
disabled.
   Arva remained at the county's Juvenile Detention Center
Wednesday night and was to be transferred today to the Broward
County Jail. But McCray said he would ask the court to let her
remain in the custody of the state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services.
   ``Society would not benefit by placing her among adults,''
McCray said.
   No charges have been filed against Ms. Butterfield, but Casey
said she is being investigated by Health and Rehabilitative
Services officials for possible neglect charges.

<TEXT>
   Nikita S. Khrushchev's ``secret speech''
denouncing dictator Josef Stalin was published for the first time
in the Soviet Union today, 33 years after it sent shock waves
through the Soviet bloc, Tass reported.
   Khrushchev's speech to a closed Communist Party congress in 1956
put an abrupt end to three decades of official glorification of
Stalin, a period during which complaints about his regime often met
with prison or death.
   The text appears in the monthly News from the Soviet Communist
Party Central Committee, the official news agency said.
   Copies of the journal were being mailed exclusively to its
650,000 subscribers, a staff member of the journal said.
   Citizens who do not already subscribe will not be able to buy a
copy, the staffer said. All subscription copies were en route to
the post office today.
   Copies of the speech were leaked to the West and published just
days after Khrushchev disclosed that Stalin had used torture,
arrests and fabricated charges to purge the leading ranks of the
Communist Party.
   Khrushchev, who was toppled from power in 1964, did not tell the
entire story of Stalin's bloody crimes. He omitted the dictator's
war against the peasants through forced collectivization and
ignored his own role during the reign of terror.
   Stalin ruled the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death in 1953.
   Prominent Soviets have called for the publication of the speech
in their own land for years. Top members of the Communist Party
heard summaries of the speech read at meetings after the congress,
but for the Soviet public at large, it has remained a mystery.
   Khrushchev freed many people imprisoned under Stalin and pulled
back from other repressive measures, but the ``de-Stalinization''
stopped after he left office.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has resumed the process, and
discussion of Stalin's repressions now is widespread.
   The same journal in February printed another so-called ``secret
speech,'' that of former Moscow party chief Boris N. Yeltsin.
   In remarks to the Central Committee in October 1987, Yeltsin
said Gorbachev was being glorified and that the Soviet people had
gained virtually nothing from the Soviet leader's reforms. The
speech led to Yeltsin's ouster as Moscow party boss and removal
from the ruling Politburo.

   Many Cuban exile leaders interpret this week's
meeting between Fidel Castro and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as
evidence of Cuba's growing political isolation.
   Gorbachev's support for ``glasnost'' during his Cuban visit, and
Castro's speech refusing to endorse his guest's political
liberalization program, left Miami's many exiles gloating.
   ``I think it was a suicidal speech _ Gorbachev is the one that
pays for Cuba and keeps the economy running,'' said Tomas Regalado,
news director of the Spanish-language radio station WQBA.
   ``I have to say that Castro is too old to change his ways, but
now the world now is changing. He is in the past.''
   Huber Matos, a militant exile leader who even recently has been
involved in a gun-running case allegedly aimed at Castro, was
exultant about Gorbachev's visit with the Cuban leader.
   ``This is a great punishment from heaven,'' Matos said
Wednesday. ``Castro has been betrayed ideologically by the Soviet
Union.''
   Some hoped that Gorbachev's pressure may do what the Bay of Pigs
invasion in 1961 failed to accomplish, and finally bring to an end
the fantasy many exiles still nurture of returning to Cuba to
overthrow Castro.
   ``It's very difficult for me to imagine a counterrevolution,''
said Rodolfo Cortina, an administrator at Florida International
University. ``I can't see the veterans in their 40s and 50s, full
of cholesterol and good living, climbing over the seawall'' into
Havana.
   With the lessening of Soviet support for Cuba, along with
Gorbachev's efforts to please the United States, exiles here may
now be more willing to accept the gradual change that seems the
most likely avenue of reform inside Cuba, Cortina said.
   ``If it means any reduction in human suffering, then I'm for
it,'' he added.
   Others, however, fear that at least in the short run, human
rights may be a victim of the ideological rift, rather than its
beneficiary. They note that even as Gorbachev bid farewell to
Castro, the Cuban government began rounding up known dissidents.
   Castro ``cannot afford an easing of controls over the
population,'' said Domingo Moreira, a director of the Cuban
American National Foundation. ``The only way he can stay in power
is by keeping the police state full blast.''

<HEAD>Skinner: Collapsed Bridge Not Among Worst</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COVINGTON, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bridge that collapsed and sent eight
people to their deaths was in better shape than many of the aging
bridges nationwide, said Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner.
   Skinner went to the site of the bridge collapse on Wednesday.
Four cars and a tractor-trailer plunged into the Hatchie River when
a section of the 55-year-old bridge collapsed Saturday 50 miles
north of Memphis.
   ``There are bridges that are in more need of repair than this
one,'' said Skinner during his visit.
   Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., who accompanied Skinner, said more
than 200,000 of the 575,000 bridges in the United States are
classified as deficient. Those weaknesses, Sasser said, range
``from minor deficiencies to major deficiencies that could lead to
tragedies similar to the one we see here.''
   The collapse left a gaping hole in the two northbound lanes of
U.S. Highway 51, but a newer companion bridge for two southbound
lanes was undamaged. The southbound bridge was closed for
inspection but was expected to reopen for two-way traffic today or
Friday.
   Authorities say spring floods may have undercut a bridge
support, but the cause of the collapse has not been determined.
   Skinner said he will press for a national policy on repairing
highway and railroad bridges. ``We're going to put a program
together and we're going to try to find a way to fund it,'' the
secretary said.
   Repairing the bridges known to be in immediate need could cost
upwards of $70 billion, Skinner said.
   Even though thousands of bridges are in bad shape, bridge
inspections generally are sufficient, in Tennessee as well as other
states, Skinner said.
   The Hatchie bridge passed inspection in 1987 and was due for
another one in about six months.
   ``That bridge ... is not anywhere close to the bottom of bridges
in this country,'' Skinner said.

   Radio Moscow's English-language service today
reported on the legalization of trade unions in Poland and an alert
listener could realize that the free trade union movement
Solidarity was included.
   The news report said Solidarity had taken part in the two-month
round-table talks, which concluded Wednesday with the signing of
historic accords that reinstates Solidarity after a seven-year ban.
   Radio Moscow said the talks had produced a number of political
agreements including one ``which states trade union pluralism.''
   The announcer said the participants also agreed on
``establishment of a two-chamber parliament and the post of a
president with broad powers.'' It said nothing about the
government's agreement to allow the first free elections since the
postwar Communist takeover.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that the talks had
ended, without giving the results. The brief announcement did,
however, mention that Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa had taken
part.
   Soviet media have reported on many of the reforms in Eastern
Europe in the past eight months, but typically days or weeks after
the event.

<HEAD>Prosecutor Who Led Fight Against Adams' Release Is Fired</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecutor who tried to keep a man imprisoned
after his conviction in a police killing was overturned has been
fired. His boss cited policy conflicts for the dismissal.
   Assistant District Attorney Winfield Scott is the third
prosector involved in the case of Randall Dale Adams to leave the
office this week.
   ``I found we had a conflict regarding current office policies
that simply could not be resolved any other way,'' said Dallas
County District Attorney John Vance. He would not elaborate on
Wednesday's firing.
   Scott did not return repeated calls from The Associated Press.
Other officials at the office declined comment.
   Over Scott's objections, Adams was released from a Texas prison
March 22, less than a month after a state court overturned his
conviction for the 1976 slaying of a Dallas police officer.
   Adams spent more than 12 years in prison. His case was
chronicled in the documentary ``The Thin Blue Line,'' in which a
key prosecution witness recanted his testimony that Adams was the
triggerman.
   Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer, said Wednesday that Scott's
actions were deplorable but added that he was being made a
scapegoat for following the office's ``marching orders.''
   Scott, who served as assistant district attorny in Dallas for 21
years, participated in the original prosecution of Adams and helped
choose a jury for the 1977 trial.
   In fighting Adams' release, Scott said state District Court
Judge Larry Baraka and eight of the nine appellate judges were
``liberal'' and biased in Adams' favor. He asked that Baraka be
removed from the case.
   The day after Adams' release, Vance said there wasn't enough
credible evidence to retry him, and the murder charge was dropped.
At the time, Vance said he would investigate Scott's behavior as a
personnel matter.
   Earlier this week, prosecutors John Creuzot and Leslie McFarlane
left, saying they were going into private practice. Both had been
with the office about six years and had worked on the Adams' case.

   The dollar was mixed in a narrow range in quiet
European trading late this morning, and dealers said they expected
the U.S. currency to remain stable until Friday's release of the
U.S. unemployment report for March.
   Gold prices also were mixed, rising in Europe but falling in

   The state filed a murder charge against an
evangelist who authorities said convinced a woman that her child
was possessed by demonic spirits, leading to the girl's death from
starvation and beatings.
   Mary Nicholson, 39, of Pace, was charged in the Feb. 8, 1988,
death of 4-year-old Kimberly McZinc, said Santa Rosa County
Sheriff's Capt. Terry Hardy.
   The girl's mother, Darlene Jackson, pleaded guilty to
third-degree murder and child abuse in the case and is awaiting
sentencing.
   In July 1987, Jackson and her daughter moved from New York to
Pace, where they lived with Nicholson's family until Kimberly's
death.
   Before pleading guilty, Jackson testified that Nicholson cast a
religious trance over her, may have drugged her, and convinced her
that Kimberly was possessed.
   Jackson said Nicholson told her the spirits could be exorcised
only through fasting and punishment. Kimberly died after being
taken by ambulance from Nicholson's home to Santa Rosa Medical
Center.
   Nicholson was jailed in lieu of $250,000 bond following her
arrest Tuesday.

<HEAD>Jury Awards Damages To World Airways Pilot, Co-pilot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN GALVIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The pilot of a World Airways jet that slid off an
icy runway into Boston Harbor in 1982 said a jury award of more
than $1 million justified his seven years of ``trauma and
heartache.''
   Pilot Peter Langley and co-pilot Donald Hertzfeldt had suffered
``emotional distress, impairment of earning capacity, lost wages
and minor physical injuries'' from the January 1982 crash, said
their attorney, Walter Walker.
   A federal jury Wednesday awarded Langley $1,021,840 and
Hertzfeldt $444,700.
   Massachusetts Port Authority, which operates Logan International
Airport, does not believe the evidence supports the verdict and
plans to ask U.S. District Judge Robert A. Keeton to set the award
aside next week, said agency spokeswoman Teresa McAlpine. By law,
the pilot and co-pilot cannot seek damages against the federal
government.
   A separate federal jury earlier this year determined that the
crash was caused by icy runway conditions at Logan and that the
Federal Aviation Association and the port authority had failed to
apprise Langley of the situation. Yet another federal jury awarded
the airline more than $30 million for the loss of the jet.
   Langley, 64, said the decision was ``justification for one's
position over the last seven years and the trauma and all the
heartache that's been going on. In retrospect, I'd rather that it
hadn't happened. Now that it has, I think it is a fair judgment.''
   ``I think the last 30 seconds on the runway are something that
I'm going to live with the rest of my life,'' he said. ``For a
pilot to feel he's not fully in control of his airplane is a most
frightening experience.''
   Langley said he lost confidence and interest in flying after the
crash and gave up his plans to become a flight engineer after he
reached the mandatory retirement age of 60.
   Hertzfeldt is working as a Pan Am shuttle co-pilot, which Walker
said was the only job he could get with a crash on his record.
   Langley said he mentioned the tarmac seemed slippery when the
jet touched down. ``Then a few seconds later I said `No braking' to
the crew,''' Langley said.
   As the end of the runway approached he saw the landing lights
and pilings of a light tower that jutted out into Boston Harbor.
Langley said he was ``literally standing on the brakes, with the
engines in full reverse thrust.''
   When the DC-10 stopped, the front end was in Boston Harbor and
the nose, which had broken off, was partially submerged. The crew
had to swim to safety, and two people sitting in the front seats
were never found and presumably drowned.

   Burundi has broken diplomatic relations
with Libya and given Libyans until Friday to leave the country,
Radio Burundi announced.
   The state-controlled radio said the tiny, land-locked central
Africa nation also has recalled its diplomats from Libya, which
early this year granted asylum to ousted Burundi President
Jean-Batiste Bagaza.
   ``The decision was reached because of Libya's involvement in
activities which undermine our security ...,'' state-owned radio
quoted Foreign Minister Cyprian Mbonimpa as saying.
   ``In recent days, Libyan diplomats are turning out in a
destabilizing campaign, which has seriously compromised peace and
unity in our country,'' the radio said without elaboration.
   The broadcast, monitored Wednesday night in Uganda's capital,
Kampala, said the decision to break ties with Libya was reached by
the Military Commitee for National Salvation in an emergency
meeting Wednesday.
   The meeting was led by President Pierre Buyoya, who formed the
committee after ousting Bagaza in a bloodless coup in October 1987.
   A Burundian diplomat in Kampala, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the expulsion order affected between 70 and 80
Libyans.
   A statement by the Libyan Foreign Ministry, carried by the JANA
news agency and monitored in Rome, said Libya was ``astonished ...
and considers this decision unjustified.''
   It said the allegations were false and the result of
``reactionary and colonialist pressures'' on the Burundi
government. It did not elaborate.

   The state Senate president has rejected former

way for Mecham to take his case to court.
   ``There no longer exists a court of impeachment or 38th
Legislature with which your documents may be filed,'' Senate
President Robert Usdane told Mecham's attorney in a letter
Wednesday.
   Mecham, a Republican, was removed from office in April 1988
after being convicted by a Senate impeachment court of obstructing
justice and misusing state money.
   In the wake of his announcement this week that he will run in
1990 for another term, Mecham is appealing his removal to the state
Supreme Court, which also could rule on whether an official
convicted by the Senate is eligible for election.
   Usdane said his decision came after consultation with Senate
attorneys and other senators.
   ``I'm pleased with the quickness of the response,'' Mecham said.
But, he said, ``The Legislature is the Legislature. The 39th
Legislature can change anything the 38th Legislature did, if they
want to.''

   The new spiritual leader of Moslems in
Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg _ whose predecessor was
slain in Brussels' main mosque _ has received death threats, police
said today.
   ``We are taking this very seriously,'' a police official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity. He said the threats that Imam
Samir Rahdi received over the telephone apparently stemmed from his
moderate views.
   The previous imam, Abdullah Ahdal, was killed along with his
librarian after Ahdal failed to support the death sentence
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued Feb. 14 against author Salman
Rushdie for his novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' which some claim
insults Islam. Ahdal also had received threats.
   Like Ahdal, Rahdi is a Saudi national. Ahdal also was a former
student of Rahdi's. ``It is somewhat logical that there are new
threats since he has the same views as his predecessor,'' the
police official said.
   The official would not specify when the threats were made. But
Belgian newspapers reported they were made in calls on Saturday and
Tuesday.
   On Friday, a pro-Iran fundamentalist group in Beirut claimed
responsibility for the murders. The group, Soldiers of Justice,
said it carried out ``God's verdict'' by killing the imam and his
librarian, Salim Behir.
   Both were shot in the head and neck from close range. Security
around Brussels' main mosque was increased after the latest
threats, police said.

<TEXT>
   An 81-year-old widow who chased an intruder
from her back door by firing at him twice with a revolver says she
fears for her safety and wants police to return her gun.
   Police said Wednesday that Annie Ryan heard a noise on her porch
Monday night, called police, and then went to investigate. As she
opened the door, the stranger forced it open and pushed her
backward.
   Mrs. Ryan retreated to her bedroom and retrieved the Smith &amp;
Wesson five-shot revolver from under her pillow. She told police
that when the gunman advanced, she aimed at the floor and fired the
gun to frighten him.
   She said she fired a second shot as he headed out the back door,
nicking the corner of the door frame, said Sgt. Robert Orlowski.
   Mrs. Ryan said the intruder stopped in the backyard, turned
toward her, and asked her how many bullets she had left. Police
then arrived and the intruder fled on foot, Orlowski said.
   ``When the officers came in, she was still holding the weapon
with two spent rounds and three live rounds in it,'' Orlowski said.
``They took the gun from her.''
   Police said they believe the gun is unregistered. If it turns
out to be a legal weapon, they'll return it to her and if not, they
may allow her to register it, police said.
   Mrs. Ryan says she needs her gun back for protection.
   ``What could I have done if I didn't have it? You can see what
could happen. I want my gun back,'' Mrs. Ryan said. She has lived
in the inner-city neighborhood since 1952, and said the gun
belonged to her husband, who died in 1979.
   Mrs. Ryan said she thought she hit the intruder with one shot.
Police found no blood at the scene, but were investigating whether
a man treated at a hospital early Tuesday could have been the
suspect.

   The form filled out by police when booking
suspects includes a question about whether the arrested person is
homosexual, a newspaper reported today.
   The 41-line form includes questions about a person's physical
description and the presence of distinguishing marks such as
tattoos. In a section on ``other identifying data,'' the form
includes a box for checking marked ``homosexual.''
   New York Newsday said it obtained a copy of the form from a
staff member of the Legal Aid Society in Brooklyn. The matter
became an issue as a result of arrests last week at a demonstration
for increased AIDS funding.
   A police spokesman, Sgt. John Clifford, said the form is meant
to gather information.
   ``No one is obligated to answer these questions,'' he said.
``It's certainly not intended to be discriminatory.''
   Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said the question violated the constitutional
right to privacy.
   He said he would demand that Police Commissioner Benjamin Ward
order the question on homosexuality removed and that police stop
asking suspects about their sexuality.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says Nepal Facing Shortages Of Food, Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nepal's ambassador to India says her
country has been facing severe shortages of food and medicine since
two treaties with India expired last month, a newspaper reported
today.
   ``As of March 23, not a pin has moved into Nepal except one
truck of rotten oranges and onions,'' Ambassador Bhinda Shah told
The Statesman, an English-language newspaper based in Bombay.
   India closed 13 of its 15 customs checkpoints along the
1,090-mile border with the Himalayan kingdom after the trade and
transit treaties expired March 23. Most of Nepal's foreign trade is
with India or conducted through India.
   After the treaties expired, the supply of essential items such
as medicine, fuel and baby food stopped, Mrs. Shah said.
   ``We are flying in medicines from Bangkok or Singapore,'' she
told the newspaper in an interview Wednesday.
   Nepal has asked India to hold talks either in Katmandu or in New
Delhi to complete drafts of new treaties. India has yet to respond.
   Mrs. Shah said the two countries signed and approved a draft
treaty on Oct. 12, 1988. But India abrogated the draft on March 1
and told Nepal the trade and transit arrangement would lapse, she
said.
   India has insisted on a unified trade and transit treaty, which
Mrs. Shah said was ``a regressive step since transit is a
recognized right of access to sea of landlocked countries, a right
which has also been recongnized by India,'' she was quoted as
saying.
   The two countries have maintained friendly ties for decades, but
India became increasingly concerned about Nepal's relations with
China.
   India and China fought a border war in 1962 and since then their
relations have remained uneasy. In August, Nepal bought unspecified
Chinese arms for its 30,000-man armed forces.
   In the interview, Mrs. Shah said the arms acquisition was purely
for the internal security of Nepal, to guard against possible
terrorist attacks.
   Nepal, locked between India and China, has to maintain good
relations with both, and there is ``no question of Nepal having
improved relations with any country at the cost of India,'' the
Statesman quoted Mrs. Shah as saying.

   Lech Walesa today called the agreement
with authorities to legalize Solidarity a victory, but he said the
nation must work hard to take advantage of the chance the pact
offers.
   Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki said the free trade union
movement, banned for seven years, could be formally registered in
court within two weeks. The agreement allows Solidarity to organize.
   Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, and the interior minister,
Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, approved the agreement Wednesday. It
reinstates Solidarity and will give Poland its first free elections
since the postwar communist takeover.
   The current one-house parliament, the Sejm, meets Friday to
enact the agreements into law.
   Walesa told a news conference at Warsaw University that
Solidarity must now organize the nation's provincial governors and
city mayors. He said the agreement was a political victory, ``a
theoretical one which may turn out to be a victory or a disaster if
we are not able to make use of it.''
   Walesa appeared unconcerned by the lack of reaction by Poles to
the restoration of the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union,
which claimed 10 million members and ignited that nation's spirit
during its 16-month legal existence in 1980-81.
   He said he expected Solidarity to attract 5 million to 7 million
members. He said he would like to see at least three competing
trade unions.
   The agreement, under which the union is to work with authorities
to revive Poland's crumbling economy, came after two months of
intensive talks. The pact also reinstates independent student,
farmer and artistic organizations banned with Solidarity after a
December 1981 military crackdown.
   Under the accords, free elections are to be held in June for a
parliament that communist authorities will still control but in
which the opposition will have strong representation.
   In Moscow today, the official Tass news agency reported only
that the talks had ended and that Walesa had participated in them.
   Radio Moscow's English-language service reported on the
legalization of trade unions and establishment of a two-chamber
parliament but made no mention of the free elections.
   A series of strikes last spring and summer and Poland's crippled
economy prompted authorities to agree to the talks that produced
the accords Walesa and Kiszczak signed Wednesday. The talks
involved 57 participants representing the opposition, the
government and the Roman Catholic church.
   The Solidarity-led opposition agreed to participate in June
elections to the 460-member lower house of parliament, or Sejm,
that guarantee the Communist Party and its allies a 65 percent
majority.
   But a new house of parliament, a 100-member Senate, would be the
first freely elected legislative body in the Soviet bloc and would
have veto power over the Sejm. Any citizen who collects 3,000
signatures can run for the Senate and all seats would be openly
contested.
   A presidency also would be created, to be elected jointly by the
Sejm and the Senate. The president would be elected this year to a
six-year term and would have broad powers to dissolve parliament
and veto laws. The post is expected to go to Jaruzelski.
   Communist officials hope the broad agreement will provide Poland
with political and labor stability so economic reforms can work to
fight high inflation, constant consumer shortages and Poland's $39
billion foreign debt.

   Gov. Bill Clements plans to sign into law a
measure requiring all motorcycle riders to wear helmets, his
spokesman said.
   ``The governor believes the evidence is overwhelming that
motorcycle helmets are in the public interest and will clearly
enhance public safety,'' said Reggie Bashur, Clements' press
secretary.
   The bill, which has passed the Senate, was approved by the House
on an 82-55 vote Wednesday and faces a final vote today.
   The action came despite arguments that the bill would interfere
with adults' freedom of choice.
   Rep. Larry Warner called the measure ``a nanny bill'' and said
the current law requiring helmets for those under age 18 is
sufficient.
   ``This is a baby-sitting bill,'' he said. He suggested that
future measures in the same vein might ``tell us we need to get
more exercise and eight hours' worth of sleep and stop smoking and
eat all our vegetables and sit up straight.''
   Rep. Ralph Wallace also defended his right to choose whether to
wear protective headgear.
   ``I own a motorcycle, and I own a helmet. Sometimes I wear a
helmet, and sometimes I don't. It's a matter of choice. Sometimes I
like to feel the wind blowing through my hair,'' Wallace said.
   Rep. Mike McKinney said the bill is ``an issue of public health,
and it's an issue of legitimate public concern.'' He said studies
show riders without helmets are more likely to have head injuries
and are twice as likely to be killed in accidents.
   ``When a person neglects his own health, safety or his welfare,
then all of us suffer,'' said McKinney, a physician and House bill
sponsor.

<TEXT>
   Syrian gunners fired rocket and mortar
rounds at a Christian Beirut suburb and army positions southeast of
the capital today in violation of a cease-fire called by the Arab
League, police reported.
   A spokesman for Gen. Michel Aoun, head of the Christian forces,
said his army units ``did not respond to the provocative acts.''
   There was no immediate report of casualties.
   Ten 120mm mortars bombarded positions manned by troops in Souk
el-Gharb, said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity. ``Three of
the mortar rounds did not explode. They have bad ammunition.''
   An hour later, six 122mm artillery rockets slammed into Dora, an
east Beirut suburb, the spokesman said.
   A police spokesman said they were the only shots fired after the
cease-fire was called. ``Other fronts are quiet,'' he said.
   Police said 177 people have been killed and 576 wounded in the
month of fighting in Lebanon between Christian and Moslem forces.
   The truce was called Wednesday by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik
Sabah Ahmed Sabah, who heads a six-man Arab League committee on
Lebanon. ``We appeal to all the warring Lebanese parties to observe
a cease-fire as of midnight Wednesday,'' Sabah said in Damascus
before he met Syrian President Hafez Assad.
   Aoun, who heads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, rejected any truce accord that does not specifically
include the Syrians as the main adversary to his 20,000 strong
Christian troops.
   ``There is only one power on the other side that can cease or
unleash fire. It is the Syrian army, and any Lebanese cover for the
Syrian army is unacceptable,'' Aoun said.
   Aoun's spokesman said the Christian forces ``will not shoot if
the Syrian army stops shooting.''
   After Sabah's talks with Assad, a Syrian presidential spokesman,
Jibran Kourieh, said Assad expressed support for the Arab League
committee.
   The cease-fire call was welcomed by acting Prime Minister Salim
Hoss, who heads the pro-Syrian Moslem Cabinet in Lebanon.
   ``I urge all sides to comply with the proposed truce out of
mercy for the battered population,'' Hoss said in a statement.
   People's reaction was cautious.
   ``We've decided to leave the underground bomb shelter to check
on our apartment and allow the children to enjoy some sunlight,''
said George Zoghbi, a resident of east Beirut's Christian district
of Ashrafiyeh.
   ``We are keeping the mattresses, blankets and supplies at the
shelter. We'll return to the shelter around midday even if it was
quiet,'' said Zoghbi, who runs an import-export business.
   Most of the 1 million Christians besieged by Syrian and allied
forces in the 310-square-mile enclave northeast of Beirut have
spent a month in underground shelters to avoid the daily Syrian
bombardment.
   Col. Patrick Keogh of Ireland, acting spokesman for the U.N.
Interim Force in Lebanon, today said about 100,000 to 120,000
Lebanese had fled to the U.N.-controlled zone in south Lebanon.
   The cease-fire accord, as outlined by Sabah, called for lifting
a blockade Aoun imposed on militia-run ports and the siege of the
Christian enclave by Syrian and allied forces.
   Jamil Hasbini, a Sunni Moslem, said he did not trust the
cease-fire and was sending his wife and four children to live with
friends in south Lebanon.
   ``The combatants are only giving us time to catch our breath,
stockpile on food and water or leave before they start fighting
again,'' he said.

<HEAD>Getty Strikes Again: Buys Renoir's `Promenade' for $17.7 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MALIBU, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum will add
Pierre-Auguste Renoir's ``The Promenade'' to its collection after
bidding $17.7 million at a London auction, the California museum
announced.
   The French Impressionist's oil painting, which depicts a man and
a woman out for a stroll, was included in artwork held by the
British Rail Pension Fund sold Tuesday night at Sotheby's. The
pension fund bought artworks during the 1970s as investments.
   ``We are overjoyed to have the picture,'' Museum Director John
Walsh said in a statement. ``It is one of Renoir's most delightful
works, and it comes from a great moment in the history of
painting.''
   The price was more than twice Renoir's record $8.8 million set
last May for a painting called ``Motherhood, or Woman Walking with
her Child,'' and far more than ``The Promenade's'' estimated value
of $7.5 million. It also was the seventh highest price ever paid
for a painting at auction.
   With a $2.1 billion endowment from the late oil baron J. Paul
Getty, the Mailbu museum is the richest art institution in the
world.
   ``It's a beautiful painting and a great acquisition,'' said
Philip Conisbee, curator of European paintings and sculpture at the
Los Angeles County Museum of Art. ``Although it is terribly
expensive, I think it is a relatively good value.''
   The Getty's collection of Impressionist and other 19th century
works includes Jean Francois Millet's ``Man With a Hoe,'' Claude
Monet's ``Still Life with Flowers,'' Edvard Munch's ``Starry
Night'' and Paul Cezanne's ``Portrait of Anthony Valabregue.''

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taiwan will send an official delegation to
China for the first time to attend the annual meeting of the Asian
Development Bank in Beijing next month, the government announced
today.
   The government said the 12-member delegation will be led by
Finance Minister Shirley Kuo and will include officials from the
Finance Ministry, the Foreign Ministry and government-owned banks.
   The decision, taken by the government Cabinet at a regular
weekly meeting, was regarded as another step in a new Nationalist
inititive to counter Communist China's efforts to isolate Taiwan
internationally.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Chen Yu-chu, told reporters the
Cabinet's decision did not signal a change in government policies
toward China. He said Taiwan would continue to oppose official
contacts with the rival communists who won a civil war in 1949,
forcing the Nationalists to flee to Taiwan.
   Chen said the delegation would not discuss relations between the
rival governments and that the Cabinet decided to approve the trip
because the annual meeting was being organized by the Asian
Development Bank and not Beijing.
   He said the delegation would attend the three-day meeting, which
begins on May 4, to ensure that Taiwan could ``actively
participate'' in the development bank and also to fulfill Taiwan's
obligations as a founding member of the bank.
   Chang Chung-tung, history professor at the National Taiwan
University, described the government's decision as ``a major
breakthrough'' and said it could lead to further flexibility toward
the mainland.
   He said it was probably intended to pressure the Chinese
communists to accept de facto Nationalist rule over this island.
   The Nationalists continue to claim they are the legitimate
government of all China, and have maintained a policy of no
contacts, no talks, no compromise toward communist China since
their defeat on the China mainland.
   But in the past year, the Nationalists have relaxed their policy
on private contacts between Taiwanese and mainland Chinese and have
allowed an exchange of visits, trade and cultural ties.
   The Asian Development Bank was founded in 1966 to help regional
development. The 47-member organization voted in 1986 to admit
China and changed Taiwan's membership name from the Republic of
China _ the official Nationalist name _ to Taipei, China.
   Nationalist officials protested then, saying the change
relegated Taiwan to a provincial government under China. The
Nationalists boycotted the development bank's annual meetings in
1986 and 1987 but attended last year's meeting in Manila, the
Philippines, where the bank has its headquarters.
   Chen said the Nationalists are still opposed to the Taipei,
China designation. He said the Nationalists would continue to
negotiate with the bank to work out a compromise solution
acceptable to both parties.
   Since the 1970s, Taiwan has been virtually isolated
diplomatically. It is now recognized by only 23 nations, while most
other countries recognize the mainland government.

<HEAD>Koch Admits Mistakes Made In Hiring But Numbers Small</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Mayor Edward I. Koch told a state commission
investigating charges of patronage in city hiring that some
apparently improper procedures amounted to ``peanuts'' when
compared to the city's overall hiring system.
   Koch appeared Wednesday before a commission studying claims that
the Talent Bank, a clearinghouse for city job applicants, was used
to award city jobs to politically connected people.
   The State Commission on Government Integrity has heard testimony
that the Talent Bank had become a patronage operation, contrary to
Koch's intent.
   Koch said the commission's hearings had created the impression
``that there is massive patronage in my administration and that
this massive patronage was hidden behind a `sham' affirmative
action program.''
   ``These charges are false,'' he said.
   Koch called the number of Talent Bank jobs filled under
questionable circumstances from 1983 to 1986 ``peanuts.''
   The Talent Bank placed about 3,000 people in jobs, most paying
less than $20,000 a year.
   ``If I had wanted to have a massive patronage program, I could
have,'' Koch said. ``But I did not want to have, nor did I have, a
patronage operation.''
   In his defense, Koch said testimony had described practices at
the Talent Bank that he would not have approved. Those practices
involved only a part of the Talent Bank's job referral services _
the laborers, deck hands and ferry agents at two agencies, he said.
   ``And the Talent Bank itself was and is a very small part of the
city's hiring program,'' he said.
   Commission Chairman John D. Feerick asked the mayor if he had
failed in his responsibilities because he wasn't aware, among other
things, that the Talent Bank computer listed applicants by who
their political sponsor was; that documents were destroyed to hide
this fact; that job postings were waived so they could be filled
with political appointees.
   Koch said he could only review the city's 42 agencies by
checking results, not by watching day-to-day operations.
   Feerick said the commission would deliver a report to the
governor sometime in May.
   The commission was appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo to
investigate corruption and inefficiency in state and municipal
governments. The commission cannot prosecute but can report its
findings to prosecutors and suggest legislation.

<HEAD>Scientists Find Increase in Radiation in Antarctic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Potentially dangerous ultraviolet radiation
streamed through the south polar ozone hole during the antarctic
spring at levels not usually reached until months later, the
National Science Foundation reports.
   While few people reside in Antarctica to be threatened by the
potential for skin cancer and other damage from the radiation,
scientists fear the rise there could presage conditions in other
areas of the world.
   The increased ultraviolet radiation was measured at the United
States' Palmer Station last September through December _ spring in
that part of the world, the foundation reported Wednesday.
   ``This is the first measurement of a clearly significant
enhancement in UV radiation reaching the ground that is linked to
human impact on the ozone layer,'' reported John E. Frederick of
the University of Chicago.
   Scientists there have been studying radiation levels because of
concerns about the depletion in the amount of ozone in the
atmosphere high above the Antarctic. That depletion has come to be
known as an ``ozone hole'' in recent years.
   Ozone, which helps filter out dangerous radiation from the sun,
is damaged by man-made chemicals, and the fear has risen that if it
is depeleted over other parts of the earth, rates of skin cancer
could rise and plants and other animals could also be damaged.
   The antarctic ozone depletion is usually at its worst in the
September-December period, a time when there is generally only
little sunligbt reaching that part of the world.
   Even so, the scientists found that rates of ultraviolet
radiation reaching the ground were typical of those usually found
in mid-summer in that region, a time of much more intense sunlight.
   The researchers are hoping to determine if the changes in
radiation will affect the food chain in the region. Ultraviolet
radiation can kill plankton, which form the basis of the food chain
in the ocean, but the effect diminishes with the depth of the water.
   Early indications were that there was no immediate threat, the
researchers said, but they plan to continue their studies.
   In a parallel experiment last fall, scientists working over the
north polar region determined that an ozone hole has not appeared
there, but they said conditions are ripe for depletion of the
protective gas in that region also.
   A northern ozone hole could pose a much greater threat, since
the bulk of the world's population lives in the northern hemisphere.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is considering a
proposal to require that gun buyers register semiautomatic assault
rifles of the kind linked to mounting drug-related violence.
   Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, said that proposal, among others, is being studied by
government agencies as the administration weighs additional steps
to control the deadly weapons.
   ``I've been asked to give comments on that and a lot of other
proposals that were made,'' Higgins, said Wednesday. ``The
administration is involved in looking at the entire issue, getting
input from a lot of people, of which this agency is one.''
   Another administration official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said today that putting semiautomatic rifles in the same
category as machine guns _ requiring an FBI background check and a
waiting period _ is ``one of the options'' actively being
considered.
   The official also said that some steps to crack down on the
sales of high-powered, rapid-fire weapons could be announced by the
administration within the next few weeks.
   An initial plan, dealing just with the District of Columbia, was
to be unveilled on Monday by federal drug coordinator William J.
Bennett. The official said this package would deal more with such
issues as finding more prison space and expanded use of federal
prosecutors than with the guns themselves, since the district
already has tough gun-control laws on the books.
   Higgins made his comments as he discussed the administration's
move to widen its temporary import ban on assault rifles to include
virtually all foreign-made models.
   Earlier Wednesday, the White House had announced that 24 models
of semiautomatic assault rifles were being added to the list of
weapons already covered by the 90-day ban on imports imposed last
month.
   The initial import suspension covered as many as 400,000
weapons. The additional list covers permits to import up to 250,000
more, Higgins said.
   ``We think we've got 99.9 percent'' of the foreign-made
semiautomatic rifles, Higgins said.
   The 90-day period for banning imports of semiautomatic weapons
will enable ATF to determine if any of the weapons on the list are
used for legitimate sporting purposes. The Gun Control Act of 1968
bans the importation of weapons that are not used for legitimate
sporting purposes.
   ``These are weapons which are identical in design'' to those on
the original list, Higgins said. ``They are basically paramilitary
in appearance, they are large-capacity magazines.''
   Importers have been given 30 days to ``substantiate that the
weapons they are selling are being used for sporting purposes,'' he
said.
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said
a prime reason for expanding the ban was to prevent a few gun
manufacturers from gaining an unfair competitive edge.
   But he conceded that ``there is some unfairness'' because the
ban still does not affect American-made high-powered rifles, which
account for 75 percent to 80 percent of the market.
   ``Unfortunately, it is not something we can do anything about,''
Fitzwater said. ``To do anything about domestically manufactured
weapons would require a change in the law.''
   Fitzwater declined to say whether Bush would eventually propose
a change in the law to include the American-made weapons.
   But Higgins said a proposal to require registration of
semiautomatic assault-style rifles is under study.
   He said President Bush has asked him to comment on imposing a
registration requirement on semiautomatic rifles that would be akin
to the current rules governing machine guns and other military
weapons.
   CBS News reported Wednesday night that Bennett, whom Bush had
asked to recommend what should be done about the weapons, told Bush
a week ago that ``Rambo-looking rifles with a large clip'' should
be treated the same as the machine guns.
   Larry Cirignano, a Bennett spokesman, said the network report
was ``not an accurate depiction'' of Bennett's views, but he
declined to elaborate. ``We never talk about what we recommend to
the president,'' he said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, last week proposed a $200
registration fee and a requirement that purchasers of the weapons
be fingerprinted and submit to a background check.
   Metzenbaum's proposal was among a number of issues discussed
last week by Bush and top federal law enforcement officials at a
White House meeting.
   The ATF director declined to describe the administration's
deliberations on the proposal. ``But that system is being
considered by a lot of different people,'' he said.
   The administration first suspended imports of assault rifles on
March 14, amid mounting furor over the use of such guns by drug
dealers and other criminals, notably the slaying of five children
in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard in January.
   The next day, Colt Industries Inc suspended sales of its popular
AR-15 rifle, an American-made weapon similar to assault-style
rifles covered by the import ban.
   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, has slowly
been moving away from the NRA's hard-line advocacy of the right to
bear arms of any type.
   While Bush initially opposed any outlawing of guns, the latest
move marks another advance in the administration's tougher stance
on assault weapons.
   The president's latest action drew sharp criticism from a group
of conservative Republican lawmakers who met with White House Chief
of Staff John Sununu to register their objections.
   ``Most of us felt the action today solves no problems.
Administratively, it's a nightmare. Practically, it solves
nothing,'' said Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
   Widening the ban was ``a confirmation of the fact that he (Bush)
is parting company'' with gun-control opponents, said Craig.

<TEXT>
   An anti-drug crusader has pleaded guilty to
harassing John Gotti but says he's not sorry for planting a fake
bomb outside a Little Italy social club frequented by the reputed
Mafia boss.
   Michael L. McCray, 37, pleaded guilty Wednesday to aggravated
harassment. The plea bargain stemmed the non-explosive package at
the front door of the Ravenite Social Club on March 20.
   He was originally charged with weapons possession.
   Criminal Court Judge Alfred Donati agreed to give McCray, a
photographer, three years' probation. He set May 31 as the
sentencing date, released McCray on his own recognizance and
ordered him to stay away from Gotti.
   After he was arrested March 29 in Tennessee, McCray said he was
trying to send a message to Gotti, the reputed head of the Gambino
organized crime family, and to others McCray said are responsible
for drug trafficking.
   He told the judge Wednesday, ``I had no intention to cause
anyone else harassment.''
   Outside the courtroom, McCray told reporters he had meant anyone
except Gotti.
   McCray also said he wasn't sorry.
   ``I still believe there's a war on drugs,'' he said. Asked if he
was afraid of antagonizing alleged mobsters, he said, ``That's the
price you pay.''

   Workers and radical students
demonstrated for the seventh straight day today to protest the
police assault that broke a strike at South Korea's largest
shipyard. At least 12 people were reported arrested.
   Government officials said the unrest in Ulsan was becoming a
showdown between authorities and ``labor movement forces,'' and
President Roh Tae-woo met with security officials to discuss the
protest.
   ``The most urgent task facing us now is to safeguard the
nation's free democratic system from leftist forces,'' Roh told the
meeting at the presidential residence in Seoul.
   In Ulsan, 150 miles southwest of the capital, hundreds of
striking workers hurled rocks and firebombs at police in the
streets around the strike-plagued Hyundai shipyard, news reports
said. Police responded with tear gas, they said.
   The news reports said 2,000 striking workers demonstrated.
   In the last two days, about 200 police, workers and citizens
were injured in the street battles, the news agency Yonhap said. It
said a house and 38 cars were burned by firebombs thrown by
striking workers.
   Protests broke out after police raided the shipyard March 30,
arresting 700 workers and ending a strike that had left 400 people
injured since Dec. 12. Most of those arrested were released, but
formal charges have been filed against 10 union leaders.
   About 3,000 police guarded the shipyard. Company officials said
60 percent of the shipyard's 19,500 employees reported to work.
   Police today arrested about a dozen strikers who attacked
non-striking workers on their way to work, Yonhap said. Hundreds of
police were deployed around residential areas to protect
non-striking workers, it said.
   ``The government's authority is being tested, and we will not
back down,'' said a senior government official in Seoul.
   The three main opposition parties dispatched investigative teams
to Ulsan today to look into the situation. Before departure, they
urged the government to stop using forceful means and try to settle
the problem through dialogue.
   Prosecutor-general Kim Gi-chun today called for stern measures
to stop violent protests and said the government was prepared for a
``major showdown'' with leftist groups.
   On Wednesday, the government ordered an investigatation of 25
leading dissident and labor groups which have either sought contact
with North Korea for talks on national unification or spearheaded
anti-government rallies.

   A ``highly tentative'' projection by the
Agriculture Department shows that 1989 wheat production could be
about 2.45 billion bushels, a 35 percent boost from last year's
drought-shriveled harvest.
   If the harvest turns out to be that much, it would be the
largest U.S. wheat output since 1984, when production was almost
2.6 billion bushels.
   Wheat production dropped in later years as tighter acreage
restrictions were imposed to help curb rising grain surpluses. And
drought took its toll last year as production dropped to 1.81
billion bushels.
   Suddenly, once-large grain inventories were drained off and
market prices rose. The USDA eased planting requirements for 1989
and is looking at possible adjustments for next year.
   The department's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation
Service has published a ``preliminary regulatory analysis'' of the
current wheat situation to help plan the 1990 program, including
some fresh projections for this year.
   ``The forecasts for the 1989 crop year are highly tentative,''
the report said. ``Production forecasts are subject to wide
variability at this time because winter wheat has not been
harvested and spring wheat has not been planted.''
   Despite such vagaries, the agency's report projected the 1989
wheat acreage for harvest at 65.5 million acres, up nearly a fourth
from 53.2 million acres harvested in 1988. That would be the
largest acreage since 1984 when 66.9 million were harvested.
   The average yield per acre harvested was projected at 37.4
bushels, up from 34 bushels in 1988. That would produce a total
wheat crop this year of 2.45 billion bushels.
   Despite the boost in production, it would leave total U.S. wheat
supplies in the 1989-90 marketing year that will begin June 1 at
only 3 billion bushels, about what they were in the current year.
   Total wheat use in the year ahead was projected at 2.47 billion
bushels, or still more than this the 1989 harvest.
   As a result, the wheat carryover a year from now _ on June 1,
1990 _ would be around 534 million bushels, or the same as it is
expected to be this June 1.
   The report projected the farm price of wheat to average $3.65
per bushel over the 1989-90 marketing year, down 10 cents from a
forecast of $3.75 for the current year.
   Analysts said the projections take into account severe drought
in Kansas where wheat production is expected to be cut sharply this
year.
   Other USDA insider estimates of Kansas wheat production are
ranging from about 190 million bushels to as much as 315 million
bushels this year, compared with 323 million bushels produced in
1988 and a 1986-88 annual average of 342 million.
   Kansas wheat farmers planted 12.4 million acres last fall, up
sharply from 10.2 million planted for the 1988 crop.
   According to one set of jottings, abandonment because of dry
weather might reduce this year's harvest to 10.5 million acres, in
which case yields could average 30 bushels per acre _ a total state
output of 315 million bushels.
   Under another ``scenario,'' however, the Kansas crop might be
reduced to 9.9 million harvested acres, a yield of 25 bushels and a
total output of 250 million bushels. The worst case version calls
for 9.3 million acres harvested, an average of 20 bushels per acre
and a total harvest of 190 million bushels.

   The Agriculture Department plans to step up
purchases of pork for donation to schools and other institutions to
help bolster sagging hog prices paid to farmers.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Wednesday the
department ``not only has bought more pork this year, but it also
has bought a greater variety of pork items than in prior years.''
   Frozen hams and canned pork are the main items bought by USDA
for distribution to schools and other domestic feeding programs. In
addition, the department soon will begin buying canned luncheon
meat, including pork, he said.
   Farmers have marketed ``unusually high'' numbers of hogs in
recent months, which have helped depress market prices, Yeutter
said. Since last July 1, the beginning of the current purchasing
year, USDA has spent more than $96 million for pork, compared with
$30 million the previous year.

   The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn for
delivery this year under a long-term supply agreement.
   More than 2.3 million tons have been purchased since the Soviets
resumed buying U.S. corn on March 28 after a layoff of almost three
months.
   The corn is scheduled for delivery by Sept. 30, the end of the
sixth year of a long-term grain supply agreement between the Soviet
Union and the United States.
   Officials said Wednesday the latest sales brought total corn
sold to the Soviets for 1988-89 to more than 12.5 million tons.
Additionally, sales include 4 million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons
of soybeans, 1.4 million tons of soybean meal, and 507,400 tons of
grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of
corn would be about 7.9 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.46 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $20 million.

   Hundreds of thousands of city dwellers
seeking to escape from a record heat wave found the beaches too hot
to handle. Even Death Valley had cooler readings.
   ``It's hotter than sin,'' said Seal Beach lifeguard Steve
Cushman. ``People are even jumping into the showers with their
clothes on out here.''
   And forecasters said there's more heat ahead.
   Wednesday's 105 degrees at the Los Angeles Civic Center
surpassed by a whopping 15 degrees the record of 90 for April 5,
set in 1971. It was the hottest reading ever posted in April,
breaking the 100-degree mark set April 23, 1910, and tied on
Tuesday.
   Forecasters said today's predicted high of 102 degrees downtown
will easily eclipse the record 91-degree peak set April 6, 1939.
   The spring heat wave was spawned by a high-pressure system
expected to linger over the West for several more days, said
National Weather Service forecaster Michael Lewis.
   More than 250,000 people fled to the beach Wednesday seeking
relief from the spell of arid weather, but mercury levels topping
100 degrees wilted the throng of cool-seekers on the sun-roasted
sands.
   It was cooler in the desert, but not by much. The mercury hit
103 in Death Valley and 104 in Palm Springs.
   The suburban community of Ontario registered the nation's
highest temperature, with a sizzling 109 degrees.
   Electricity consumption _ 14,282 megawatts at 4 p.m. Wednesday _
was the highest ever for an April day, but still shy of the peak
15,987 megawatts used on Sept. 6, 1988, when the temperature
downtown was 110 degrees, said Paul Klein of Southern California
Edison.
   Despite the moisture-sapping heat, the Los Angeles County Fire
Department said the wildfire season was still months away because
hillsides were still green from winter rains.

<HEAD>Lying About Age Gets Councilwoman In Trouble</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALVIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city councilwoman faces possible legal
action because she lied about her age on her sworn candidacy
application.
   ``Since I was divorced 13 years ago, I have consistently knocked
10 years off my age, along with every other woman in the United
States,'' Loyce Crouch said.
   Ms. Crouch, 59, surrendered her keys to City Hall, saying she
will never return, after she acknowledged at a City Council meeting
Tuesday night that she had misrepresented her age since she won her
first election in 1979.
   She said she stated in her candidate applications that she was
born in 1940 although voter registration records showed that she
was born in 1929.
   District Attorney Jim Mapel said he plans to present allegations
to a grand jury that Ms. Crouch committed perjury.
   ``If knocking 10 years off my age constitutes perjury in the
eyes of those people, well, then this evidently is not the nation
that I revered,'' she said.
   City Attorney J. Kay Gayle says the problem is not that Crouch
lied about her age, but that she falsified a public document and
swore that the information included in the document was correct.
   Ms. Crouch claims the matter was brought up because some other
members of the City Council ``don't want me to sit here.''
   ``I am being pushed so that I will no longer open my mouth,''
she said. ``I'm tired of it all.''

<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas today ignored a
cease-fire declared by the government and fired missiles and
rockets at Kabul and three other cities, witnesses and the
government said.
   A missile blew up a fuel truck parked near a petroleum tank
depot on the northern edge of Kabul. Several trucks parked nearby
also exploded.
   A cloud of black smoke, visible over the city of 2 million,
drifted from the site. There was no immediate word on casualties.
   An Afghan truck driver who said he was part of a convoy hauling
fuel down the Salang Highway from Hayratan, on the Soviet border,
said guerrillas tried to hijack some of the trucks a few miles
north of Kabul.
   The driver, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
hijackers got about a mile before they were attacked by two
government helicopters.
   The Foreign Ministry said guerrillas fired rockets and cannons
at the cities of Jalalabad, Kandahar and Sarobi. Ministry spokesman
Mohammad Nabi Amani said government troops held their fire. He had
no information on casualties.
   His report could not be confirmed.
   Kabul's military command announced a unilateral cease-fire
Wednesday night on the eve of Ramadan, the Islamic holy month.
   President Najib told the British Broadcasting Corp. that the
government would retaliate with renewed force if the U.S.-backed
guerrillas broke the cease-fire.
   Amani said guerrillas fired 32 rockets and cannon rounds today
at the southern city of Kandahar, where government forces have been
besieged for the past year.
   Fewer than 100 rounds were fired at Jalalabad, he said. In the
past two weeks, the government has accused the guerrillas of firing
as many as 12,000 rounds a day at the city, which is 75 miles east
of Kabul.
   Amani said he had no indication how many rounds were fired at
Sarobi, midway between Kabul and Jalalabad.
   The Ramadan cease-fire was at least the fifth unilateral
cessation of hostilities declared by Najib since January 1987. None
has succeeded.
   The guerrillas have ignored every government-declared
cease-fire, and the government itself usually quickly follows suit.
   Amani said Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, who left Kabul on
Monday, still was waiting for a U.S. visa in Moscow. He wants to
appeal to the United Nations to hold a special Security Council
session on the Afghan fighting.
   On Wednesday, guerrilla rockets slammed into downtown Kabul,
killing six people and wounding 23, a government official said on
condition of anonymity.
   Official Radio Kabul said 10 people were killed and 39 wounded.
   Most of the Afghan guerrillas are based in Pakistan. They have
received support from the United States, China, Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia and other countries in their decade-old war against the
Soviet Union's protege government in Kabul. The Red Army ended its
nine-year involvement in Afghanistan Feb. 15, but Moscow is still
supplying the Najib government.
   Wednesday's rockets spewed shrapnel and debris as they hit a
small park next to the Kabul Hotel and a commercial district
several blocks away. The rockets, which landed four to 10 blocks
from the Foreign Ministry, were fired before noon, when sidewalks
and marketplaces are crowded with pedestrians.

   This potato-farming community of about 600
is facing insolvency after being ordered to pay $50,000 to settle a
decade-old lawsuit by a pool-hall owner arrested for opening on a
Sunday.
   Town Attorney Winston Jacobo told the Town Council it has been
ordered to pay by 4 p.m. Tuesday or the council members will be
held in contempt of court.
   Jacobo told council members they have about $65,000 available
but also have unrelated bills totaling $31,000.
   ``If you vote to pay it the settlement, you vote to make the
town insolvent,'' Jacobo said. ``We don't have the money to pay.''
   The council authorized Jacobo to ask attorneys for George
Pierce, the pool-hall owner, to accept $20,000 now and $10,000 a
year until the debt is paid.
   Alternatives would be for the town to declare bankruptcy or ask
the Legislature to take away the town's charter.
   If the town becomes insolvent, Jacobo said the state might pull
the town's charter anyway.
   About 75 people crammed into Town Hall late Wednesday to find
out whether Hastings could remain solvent.
   One resident, Dartha Marshall, said none of the council members
were in city government when the arrest was made and should not be
held accountable. She blamed former Mayors Jody Bateman and Greg
Maltby and the former town attorney for the problem.
   In 1978, Pierce, now 52, was arrested for operating his game
room on a Sunday afternoon, in violations of a local law.
   County Judge Robert Andreu threw out the charges, and Pierce
filed a lawsuit. He claimed he lost $100,000 in business from the
incident.
   A jury awarded him $44,000 in 1981, but a judge reduced it to
$23,800. Later, a new trial was ordered and this time, in 1984, a
jury awarded him $65,000.
   Some payments have been made, but the town still owes almost
$50,000.

   A Palestinian died today of a gunshot wound
sustained in earlier violence, and an Israeli soldier shot and
critically wounded a teen-age protester in Bethlehem, witnesses and
Arab news reports said.
   Six other Palestinians _ a woman and five teen-agers _ were
reportedly wounded in two other clashes in Israeli-occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel's army said it was checking the reports.
   An Israeli newspaper reported from Washington, meanwhile, that
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir may order a withdrawal of troops from
some of the heavily populated areas in the occupied territories.
   Israeli editorial writers responded with satisfaction to results
of Shamir's meeting Wednesday with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, who called the Israeli leader's peace ideas ``very
encouraging.''
   Editors wrote it was an indication Shamir's meeting today with
President Bush would not turn into a confrontation.
   In the West Bank village of Deir Salah, 200 Palestinians
chanting ``PLO! Israel No!'' followed the coffin of Salem Ismail
Salah, 27. Arab reports and doctors at Jerusalem's Mukassed
Hospital, where he died today, said Salah was shot in the head
during a March 30 clash with troops.
   In Bethlehem, reporters said they saw a soldier shoot and
critically wound a 17-year-old Palestinian. The incident began when
100 Palestinians threw stones and empty bottles near Manger Square,
the reporters said.
   Four soldiers arrived, chased fleeing demonstrators and fired
live ammunition at them, according to the reporters.
   One soldier ran after Nassar, knelt on the ground, took aim and
shot the youth twice from about 40 yards away, the reporters said.
Mukassed Hospital doctors said the youth was critically wounded.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, a 38-year-old woman and a
17-year-old boy were shot and wounded when troops opened fire on a
protest against Israeli occupation. ``Shamir is no good!'' some
youths shouted.
   Troops also wounded four teen-age boys in the arms and legs when
they opened fire on stone-throwing protesters at Khan Yunis refugee
camp in Gaza Strip, Arab reports said. The army said it wounded two
youths there.
   Arab reports said other confrontations occurred in Gaza City and
the West Bank city of Hebron, but there were no injuries.
   The violence occurred a day after the army freed 465 Palestinian
prisoners as a goodwill gesture for the Moslem month of Ramadan,
which starts tonight.
   The releases also coincided with Shamir's talks in Washington on
reviving the Middle East peace process.
   Hadashot newspaper reported the prime minister was considering
three other moves to satisfy U.S. demands for eased tensions. One
possibility is ``a symbolic withdrawal of Israeli forces from
several heavily concentrated population centers,'' it said, adding
this did not mean a full pullback.
   Two other gestures included opening West Bank schools shut
through most of the uprising and freezing deportation orders
against 13 Palestinians.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, Israel has deported
to Lebanon 45 Palestinians accused of inciting riots. The United
States had condemned such expulsions. At least 420 Palestinians
have been killed in the rebellion. Eighteen Israelis also have died.

   A Trinity University fraternity has been
charged with violating the school's anti-hazing policy after a
Jewish pledge wore a Nazi uniform on campus.
   Representatives of the Triniteers fraternity have a week to
defend the practice before a dean. If found guilty, penalties could
involve revocation of the fraternity's charter, mandatory community
service or probation limiting the fraternity's social activities.
   The president of the fraternity, Pete Sturdivant, said the
incident ``is being blown completely out of proportion'' and that
punishment is not warranted.
   The student, Andy Ellenthal, dressed as a Nazi soldier with a
swastika armband on March 30 as part of a fraternity tradition
requiring pledges to wear costumes. He did not wear the costume to
class.
   Ellenthal, 18, said he selected and purchased the outfit
himself, adding that it was intended only as a joke.
   After the matter is resolved, dean Coleen Grissom intends to
bring together fraternity and sorority members, professors and
other students to discuss the implications of the incident.
   ``She wants to convey that certain images and symbols are
unacceptable,'' Trinity spokeswoman Sharon Jones said.
   The independent-religious college has about 2,700 students.

<HEAD>High School Principal Suspended Over Nude Film Demands Reinstatement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Palisades Park principal has been
suspended by the school board for allowing a movie with nudity to
be filmed at his high school two years ago.
   Nicholas S. Rotonda said Wednesday that the suspension was
``political'' and demanded to be reinstated.
   Rotonda was suspended Saturday for letting New York-based
Upfront Productions use the school to make a movie that shows
actresses, posing as teachers and students, briefly exposing their
breasts.
   Rotonda said the district school board had approved the movie,
``Senior Week,'' which the filmmakers had told him would be a spoof
on spring break. He said the movie, made in the summer of 1987, was
filmed on weekends and at night when he was not present to
supervise.
   The school board has denied knowing anything about the agreement
with the movie company.
   Dozens of students marched Monday at Palisades Park High School
to protest Rotonda's suspension, and teachers approved a resolution
backing him and calling for his reinstatement.
   The existence of the film was made public a few days before
Tuesday's school board election in which a board president opposed
by Rotonda was seeking re-election. Board President Janette
Zuckerman and five of her supporters were defeated in the balloting
to fill six vacant seats on the nine-member board.
   ``I'm just trying to get my name cleared at the moment and have
them put me back in the school,'' said Rotonda, 51, who has been
principal at the high school for six years. ``They lost the
election. Let's just get back to business.''
   ``As a result of a political battle I was being used as a
scapegoat,'' Rotonda said. He said he was denied due process and
was considering what action to take with his lawyer.
   School Superintendent George Fasciano, who suspended Rotonda
until the board could meet and investigate the matter, was in the
hospital Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
   Ms. Zuckerman, vice president of the board when the film was
made, said she asked to have Rotonda suspended after finding his
name on an agreement with Upfront Productions that the school board
knew nothing about.

   Among those mentioned as possible replacements was Sherrie
Marshall, a former Patrick aide who was on loan to the White House
during the unsuccessful confirmation proceedings for Defense
Secretary-designate John Tower.
   Washington attorneys Susan Wing and Jim Smith also have been
mentioned, along with Alfred Sikes, head of the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications and Information
Administration.
   At a news conference, Patrick said he was confident the next FCC
chairman would carry on an agenda seeking deregulation. He said
there would be ``no substantial slowing of progress.''
   ``It is not a static (telecommunications) market and the
regulatory response will not be static,'' he said.
   Patrick thanked President Bush ``for his continuing support''
despite rumors he had been on the skids since Bush took office.
Calling his resignation ``absolutely voluntary,'' Patrick said,
``The White House has been absolutely supportive of me since day
one.''
   Patrick said he would return to private industry but would
remain in his job until a replacement was named. The 37-year-old
former California attorney said he has no plans, has conducted no
job interviews and would not excuse himself from any pending FCC
decisions.
   Until he leaves the FCC, ``it will be business as usual,''
Patrick said.
   ``We have accomplished substantially all'' his agenda, and now
``I desire and am very anxious to return to the private sector.''
   One of Patrick's congressional foes, Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., said he looked forward to a better ``balance'' between
consumer and business interests under a new FCC chairman. He said
deregulation under Patrick had turned into ``deregulation for
deregulation's sake.''
   But Patrick was praised widely by industry representatives.
   James Billingsley, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.'s senior
vice president _ federal regulation, said Patrick ``has been an
enthusiastic and forceful proponent of fundamental changes in
regulation that will greatly serve the public interest and our
industry long after he has left the commission.''
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said Patrick was ``a man of principle and dedication
who has made his mark on communications policy.''
   William L. Weiss, chairman of the Ameritech phone company, said
he was ``optimistic a successor will be selected who will build on
Mr. Patrick's contributions to a progressive regulatory framework
for the information age.''
   Patrick was named to the FCC by then-President Reagan in 1983,
after working in the White House personnel office, and was named
chairman, succeeding Mark S. Fowler, in April 1987.
   Among his major accomplishments, Patrick successfully proposed
the change in the way long-distance rates are set by AT&amp;T and led
the FCC's repeal of the Fairness Doctrine, which required
broadcasters to air opposing views on controversial issues.
   Under Patrick, the commission also has moved to change the way
broadcasters are licensed, guaranteed exclusive licenses to
syndicated TV programs, made a preliminary ruling on standards for
high-definition television and generally has followed the
deregulatory approach of the Reagan administration.
   The commission has been two members short of its normal
five-member complement since last year. Nominations to fill the two
vacant seats were held up because of Senate displeasure with
Patrick's policies.

   House Speaker Jim Wright converted a $3,000
speaking fee from a Texas university into a bulk sale of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man,'' because he otherwise couldn't
accept the money under House rules, the speaker acknowledged.
   The sale of 504 copies of the book to Southwest Texas State
University following a 1984 lecture Wright delivered at the school
is under examination, along with other such sales, as part of an
ethics committee investigation of the speaker's finances.
   The panel is looking into whether Wright used the book sales in
some instances to evade limits House rules impose on outside income
from speaking and writing fees, and is examining other areas of the
speaker's conduct for potential violations of at least four other
rules.
   In October 1984, when Wright delivered the university speech, he
already was bumping up against the $23,630 maximum he could accept
in speaking fees for the year under House rules. In addition, the
$3,000 check the university sent him was $1,000 more than the
maximum the rules allow.
   An aide asked him what to do about it, Wright told reporters on
Wednesday.
   ``I said $3,000 is actually more than I can properly accept,''
the speaker said he responded. ``He said, well, maybe they want to
buy some books. I said if they want to buy some books, that'll be
fine. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.''
   Wright's income from the book sales _ about $1,650 _ was not
subject to House limitations.
   The incident is similar to a previously reported bulk sale of
the book in 1985, when Wright sent 336 copies to The New England
life insurance company in return for $2,000 initially intended as
an honorarium. But in that case, the speaker's office defended it
by saying the deal was arranged by aides without Wright's knowledge.
   Wright received 55 percent of the proceeds from each copy of the
slim $5.95 volume, collecting a total of $55,000 in royalties.
   The ethics committee met again today and had a full day of
deliberations scheduled for Friday. Chairman Julian Dixon,
D-Calif., said he anticipated some conclusion in the case next week.
   Dixon also said the committee is asking the House to add
$600,000 to its budget for this year, in part to cover growing
costs of the Wright probe. ``We're basically out of money,'' Dixon
said.
   He said the money would go to cover additional fees for Richard
Phelan, the outside counsel retained for the Wright investigation,
to cover expenses incurred in that probe, and to pay for other
unrelated ethics cases.
   In addition to the issue of evading income ceilings, the ethics
panel also is deliberating several other potential rules violations:
   _Whether the speaker should have reported as gifts a series of
benefits he received from a business partner, Fort Worth developer
George Mallick;
   _Whether Mallick had ``a direct interest'' in legislation, which
would have made any gift over $100 improper;
   _Whether in working for ``forbearance'' language in a bill
dealing with savings and loan institutions, Wright improperly used
influence on behalf of a business partner; and
   _Whether the speaker's overall conduct violated a general
requirement that a lawmaker ``conduct himself at all times in a
manner which shall reflect creditably on the House of
Representatives.''
   As the committee went into the home stretch in its
deliberations, Wright's allies were preparing their defense,
compiling lengthy point-by-point rebuttals to potential findings of
rules violations.
   But the speaker's opponents said even if some charges are
dropped, the remaining issues are serious enough to cause the
speaker severe political damage. ``The evidence strikes me as
fairly overwhelming,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., Wright's
chief accuser.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher today argued passionately during a
four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to
reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials said.
   Reopening a European peace offensive that was disrupted by the
Armenian earthquake, Gorbachev had ``extremely frank exchanges,
animated, warm, passionate and solemn,'' said a Thatcher spokesman,
requesting anonymity.
   Gorbachev also hit the streets of London, stopping his motorcade
to shake hands with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred
who cheered him outside Westminster Abbey.
   The Thatcher spokesman said the Soviet leader and the staunchly
anti-communist prime minister ``love arguing.''
   Emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence into the icy rain,
with Gorbachev at her side, Mrs. Thatcher told reporters:
   ``The talks have been very deep, very wide ranging and very
friendly, and as always we got to grips with the real issues.''
   The spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher asked Gorbachev about a report
from Washington that Moscow sold up to 15 long-range
fighter-bombers to Libya, which Britain accuses of sponsoring
terrorism. Gorbachev did not respond, he said.
   He said Mrs. Thatcher also accused the Soviets of having been
``not as frank as they should be'' about their chemical weapons
arsenal.
   He quoted Gorbachev as replying: ``If you aren't fully
satisfied, then quite clearly we have to have more exchanges. We
have got to try better to convince each other.''
   Another area of disagreement was Gorbachev's goal of eliminating
all nuclear weapons from Europe. Mrs. Thatcher believes the
deterrence of nuclear weapons prevents war and ``expressed her
objection to any suggestion'' of scrapping short-range nuclear
weapons, the spokesman said.
   Britain is the first NATO country Gorbachev has visited since
the earthquake cut short his U.S. tour in December and forced him
to reschedule a trip to Britain.
   Arriving at Mrs. Thatcher's residence, he waved and smiled to
onlookers and was applauded by office staff who lined the corridors.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the talks were ``an example of the new spirit
of friendliness and negotiation and cooperation between East and
West.''
   Gorbachev thanked the British people ``for reaching out to the
people of Armenia and to the people of the Soviet Union'' in the
earthquake relief effort.
   He said the British-Soviet dialogue ``has reached a very high
level now. It is a very substantive dialogue. And I must say the
degree of mutual understanding is increasing.''
   He said this ``has enabled us today to discuss constructively
the various problems of international politics.''
   Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, went sightseeing in London, starting at
St. Paul's Cathedral where she gave a bear hug to a 4-year-old girl
who presented her with a bouquet of flowers.
   The Gorbachevs went to Westminster Abbey to lay a wreath at the
Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, then Gorbachev met the crowds.
   Tim Haggarty, 23, from Northern Ireland, who waited in the rain
for 90 minutes to be first to shake hands, said afterward: ``He's
trying to create peace in the world. He has to be treated like the
hero he is.''
   Gorbachev, he said, told him in Russian: ``I thank you very much
for being here. It's really nice to see you.''
   At Downing Street, Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher sipped champagne
and watched as their foreign ministers, Sir Geoffrey Howe and
Eduard Shevardnadze, signed memorandums of understanding to ease
travel restrictions between the two countries and boost British
investment in the Soviet Union.
   They also signed an agreement for British contractors to build a
$7 million school in Leninakan, a city devastated by the Armenian
earthquake.
   Explaining the Armenian project, Mrs. Thatcher said: ``When we
asked the people of Armenia what they would like as a gift they
asked us especially for a new school.''
   Gorbachev arrived late Wednesday night from Cuba, where he
proposed making Latin America a ``zone of peace.'' In a major
speech Friday at London's Guildhall, he is expected to press for
something similar in Europe.
   Mrs. Thatcher, her spokesman said, thanked Gorbachev for a
Soviet decision to release nine prisoners believed to be jailed for
religious activities and to allow 14 more Jewish refuseniks to
emigrate.
   But about 50 people, including former Liberal Party leader David
Steel, stood across the street from 10 Downing St., reading aloud
from a list of 10,000 names of refuseniks being denied permission
to leave the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>State Fined For Prison Overcrowding</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today fined the state
$164,250 for prison overcrowding and ordered that the money be used
to set up a bail fund for indigent defendants.
   U.S. District Judge Raymond J. Pettine ruled the state was in
contempt of court for failing to limit to 250 the number of
prisoners awaiting trial in an intake unit.
   Overcrowding at Rhode Island's only jail for inmates awaiting
trial has been a problem for years, but mushroomed last year after
the Legislature passed laws allowing drug defendants to be held
without bail.
   The Corrections Department, under pressure from Pettine, opened
two annexes to the intake unit, but has been unable to keep up with
the exploding population. Construction of a new prison building has
been stalled by local opposition in Cranston, where the Adult
Correctional Institutions complex is located.
   Last fall, Pettine gave the state until Feb. 20 to reduce the
population at the intake unit to 250. As of Monday, the population
was 464, said Joseph A. DiNitto, state Corrections Department
spokesman.
   Pettine imposed fines of $50 per extra inmate per day from Feb.
20 to March 13, and said further fines up to $289,000 or more would
be imposed if necessary to meet his order to reduce crowding.
   ``I think that's just what was needed to ensure this problem is
taken care of,'' said Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode
Island chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. The ACLU sued
the state 13 years ago over prison conditions.
   Pettine ordered the state to turn over the money within 15 days
to the Corrections Department, but stayed the order to give state
officials a chance to appeal.
   DiNitto said he had not yet seen the ruling and would not
comment on it.
   The governor said the decision will be appealed.
   Pettine praised the state for submitting long-range plans to
alleviate overcrowding, but said the state should be fined because
it ignored options such as the bail fund proposed by the ACLU.
   Any prisoner being held on $5,000 or less cash bail will be
eligible to have bail paid by the fund. Pettine recommended that
maximum use be squeezed from the money by bailing first those
prisoners being held on $1,000 bail or less before those being held
on higher amounts.
   ``These pre-trial detainees are in jail only because they are
too poor to make bail,'' Pettine wrote.

   A government contracting officer
testified today that the Defense Department had received a
better-than-expected price when it negotiated a $24 million
contract with a California defense contractor to make hand-held
radar equipment in July 1987.
   The testimony of William Massie, who handled contracts for the
project, came as the defense opened its case in the trial of three
former executives at Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.
All are charged with bribery, conspiracy and making false
statements.
   Before a parade of defense witnesses was called, U.S. District
Judge Richard Williams denied defense motions to dismiss bribery
and conspiracy charges against the three _ Eugene Sullivan, George
Kaub and Dale Schnittjer.
   The government finished its case Wednesday with prosecutors
attempting to persuade the jury that the three defendants knew a
private consultant hired by Teledyne Electronics had paid bribes to
a Navy engineer to help secure the radar equipment contract.
   The defense contends the former executives were unwittingly
duped by private consultants hired by the company.
   Massie, the contracting officer, said the government's objective
was to allow the defense contractor a 13.74 percent rate of profit
on the job. In fact, Massie said, Teledyne Electronics agreed to
only a 13.5 percent rate of profit, meaning the government got a
cheaper price than it had expected.
   Under cross-examination, however, Massie acknowledged that that
price was still ``not necessarily'' the best possible price.
   On Wednesday, William Parkin, a consultant who has pleaded
guilty to bribery and is cooperating with the government, testified
that he took a portion of the money that Teledyne gave him and
channeled it to another consultant, Fred Lackner. Lackner, in turn,
paid bribes to Stuart Berlin, a Navy engineer familiar with the
contract.
   The government contends that the three defendants knew that
Parkin and his consortium were bribing Berlin. The defense says the
former Teledyne executives were innocent victims of a conspiracy
devised by Parkin and Lackner.
   Teledyne Electronics paid Parkin $10,000 in up-front money in
November 1985 to help win the contract, and agreed to hand over
another $150,000 in February 1988 after Teledyne won the contract.
   FBI agent Michael Swinhoe testified that he had interviewed Kaub
after the government's investigation of Pentagon fraud and
kickbacks was made public in June 1988.
   According to the agent, Kaub said he was ``not aware of any
illegal or unethical behavior'' on Parkin's part.
   But Kaub said he was skeptical of the consultant ``by virtue of
Mr. Parkin's profession as an influence peddler.''
   Kaub, who was Teledyne's vice president dealing with government
contracts, said the ``nature of the environment'' in which Parkin
worked was also cause for some concern.
   On the witness stand, Parkin admitted that he had taken about
$50,000 in bribes over a 10-year period while he was employed by
the Defense Department. Parkin left the Navy, where he had been
director of acquisitions for the Joint Cruise Missile Project, in
October 1983.
   The trial in federal court is the first brought by the
government in its investigation of the $150 billion purchasing
system at the Defense Department.
   Except for the three executives, all the people named in the
indictment, including Parking, Lackner and Berlin, have pleaded
guilty, as has Teledyne.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Troops loyal to Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril guarded the National Palace today with anti-aircraft guns and
cannons after he declared a state of emergency to counter the
week's second military rebellion.
   The order Wednesday by the embattled president, in power for
just six months, also included a dusk-to-dawn curfew. Early today,
he went on state-run television to appeal to the mutineers to end
their uprising.
   Government forces also stood guard outside the national bank and
the telecommunications office, which were briefly occupied by the
rebels Wednesday.
   Sporadic machine-gun fire and what sounded like exploding
grenades could be heard during the night. Radio Soleil, the Roman
Catholic station, reported today that one man was shot to death and
three other people were wounded overnight, but the circumstances
were unclear.
   Several hundred youths marched into downtown Port-au-Prince at
midmorning and erected barricades of tires and boxes which they set
on fire. Soldiers fired into the air to disperse the crowd.
   About 25 rebel soldiers and 200 supporters stood outside a
military barracks 200 yards away from the palace, which was guarded
by loyal soldiers.
   Most stores were closed, and few buses or cars moved through the
capital.
   Avril appeared on television at 2 a.m., speaking calmly for
about 10 minutes from his office in the National Palace. He was
surrounded by soldiers.
   ``I exhort you brothers in arms, soldiers of our splendid army,
to leave the vile path of treason and national shame and find once
again the shining path of honor and dignity,'' he said.
   Wednesday's uprising was the second in the 7,000-man army since
Sunday, when an attempt to overthrow Avril's government was foiled
by loyal soldiers who rescued him as he was being driven to the
airport to be deported.
   Avril denounced the rebels who held his 14-year-old son and
88-year-old mother hostage during Sunday's coup attempt. The
soldiers also briefly held hostage two of Avril's brothers. All
were released unharmed.
   In imposing a curfew Wednesday, the government blamed Sunday's
coup attempt on a ``vast campaign against drug trafficking,
contraband and corruption'' that ``collided with the interests'' of
those who oppose democratic change.
   Avril has recently discharged or transferred several officers in
a crackdown on corruption and drug trafficking.
   The United States has made the crackdown a condition for the
resumption of $70 million in annual aid that it suspended after
thugs killed 34 voters in November 1987, thwarting Haiti's first
free elections in more than 30 years.
   On Wednesday, a rebellion broke out in the Dessalines Barracks,
which adjoins the presidential palace. It was unknown how many of
the 700 Dessalines were taking part.
   About 25 Dessaline soldiers and 200 supporters stood today
outside the barracks, demanding Avril hand over power to the
president of the Supreme Court of Appeals, Gilbert Austin, a former
justice minister.
   ``There is no compromise possible with Gen. Avril,'' said one
soldier on condition of anonymity. ``We will camp here until he
leaves.''
   But it did not seem Avril, who appears to have the support of
the 1,000 presidential guardsmen, would relinquish power
voluntarily.
   ``It's a standoff. I think they're just staring each other
down,'' one Western diplomat said.
   Avril's Presidential Guard stationed two anti-aircraft guns,
four armored personnel carriers and three-wheeled cannons inside
the National Palace compound.
   Radio stations ignored a government order for newspapers, radio
and television not to diseminate information except with the
military's permission. The censorship order came after the
Dessalines soldiers went on the independent radio Metropole to
demand Avril resign. They blame him for the deaths of four rebel
soldiers who held the airport Sunday and Monday.
   Those four were members of the elite 400-member Leopard commando
unit that had about 100 of its soldiers holding the airport because
their commander was being held under military guard, accused of
being the ringleader of Sunday's attempt to overthrow Avril.
   Avril deported the three alleged coup leaders. In Miami, U.S.
immigration officials said the three officers arrived Wednesday and
applied for asylum.
   A statement by Army General Headquarters, read on state
television, ordered all soldiers to report to their command posts.
   Avril, 50, came to power in a Sept. 17 coup led by
noncommissioned officers who said they overthrow Lt. Gen. Henri
Namphy because they wanted to end state-sponsored violence and
corruption.
   Namphy took over in 1986 when longtime dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier fled to exile in France.

   A Navajo tribal judge has banned the
tribe's police chief from the reservation for failing to enforce
court orders related to embattled Chairman Peter MacDonald's
struggle to retain power.
   Window Rock District Judge Robert Yazzie signed an order
Wednesday excluding Police Chief Wilbur Kellogg from the
reservation pending a hearing on Monday.
   An anti-MacDonald majority of the Tribal Council has voted to
place MacDonald on leave, but the flamboyant head of the nation's
largest Indian tribe has resisted.
   ``For the last two months, I've just been a football back and
forth between the two factions,'' said Kellogg, who remained at his
office late Wednesday.
   Kellogg was found in contempt and fined $500 by the Tribal
Supreme Court earlier this week for having failed to enforce a
court order barring J. Tonny Bowman, an appointee of the
pro-MacDonald Advisory Council, from taking over Yazzie's court.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   _Tribal Controller Bobby White, confronted by 50 angry MacDonald
appointees and others, handed over 31 paychecks that had been
withheld by order of the anti-MacDonald majority of the Tribal
Council.
   _The general manager of tribal radio station KTNN said the
tribal attorney general's office told him in a memorandum that
MacDonald, because of a temporary restraining order issued by
tribal court, should not be allowed to use the station's air time
to make the weekly ``Chairman's Report.''
   KTNN General Manager Freddie Howard said the station would have
to disobey because of concerns about fairness, free speech and
Federal Communications Commission requirements. Howard said the
station would not drop either MacDonald's report or one made by
Leonard Haskie, the interim chairman selected by the Tribal Council.
   ``This borders on trying to censor somebody,'' Howard said.
``It's just like telling a newspaper what to print or what not to
print.''
   Howard also said, ``I can't allow politics to jeopardize our
good standing with the FCC. The issue isn't MacDonald or Haskie.''
   MacDonald was placed on paid administrative leave by the Tribal
Council after witnesses before a U.S. Senate committee testified he
received gifts and kickbacks in connection with tribal business
dealings.
   MacDonald, who has denied such wrongdoing, has maintained the
council's action was invalid and illegal. He has tried to retain
his authority by firing opponents and those who attempt to remain
neutral.

   Some Communist Party leaders in Leningrad blamed
psychological attacks and malicious press coverage for the
humiliating defeat of 12 city officials in last month's elections,
a newspaper reported Thursday.
   But others at a special meeting called to discuss the election
disaster said the party itself was responsible for the ``crisis of
confidence'' in its abilities, said Sovietskaya Rossiya, the
Russian republic's official party and government newspaper.
   The meeting, the first extraordinary session of the Leningrad
party organization in 30 years, came four days after some party
members demanded the resignation of the Leningrad leadership, the
newspaper said.
   Leningraders on March 26 rejected every one of local officials
running for seats in the Soviet Union's new parliament, the
newspaper said.
   Yuri Solovyev, a candidate member of the party's ruling
Politburo and regional party chief, ran unopposed and still lost
because more than half the voters crossed out his name on the
ballot. He characterized the results as ``depressing,'' Sovietskaya
Rossiya said.
   Sovietskaya Rossia said Tuesday's meeting ``occurred in an
atmosphere of openness, honesty and toughness of evaluation, and
impartial criticism, which we have dreamed about since the
beginning of perestroika.''
   The newspaper concluded that if such a meeting had occurred
previously, the party might not have suffered so in the elections.
   ``Leningraders are not satisfied with the tempo and path of
perestroika in the city,'' the newspaper quoted V.P. Smirnov as
saying. ``They don't feel that the leadership of the city defends
the interests of the population, of the working class or the
intelligentsia,'' said Smirnov, a radio controller and member of
the regional party leadership.
   Clearly, ``a crisis of confidence has been outlined,'' he said.
   But the newspaper said many speakers blamed the loss on
``malicious press, strongly creating a negative stereotype of the
party bureaucrats.''
   It listed four party leaders who ``spoke with alarm about the
psychological attack being carried out against the party. And isn't
it strange that some organs of the press united with forces which
are extremely far from the ideas of Marxism-Leninism.''
   The report did not give examples of what they regarded as
``malicious'' press coverage.
   ``We insufficiently evaluated the ideological prejudice and
bourgeois illusions which have been spreadly recently, and the
dissatisfaction of the people with the growth of the deficit,
inflation, crime, miscalculations in the organization of the
cooperative movement,'' the newspaper said, paraphrasing the four
officials.
   It identified the four as Y.A. Petrosyan, the director of an
institute; Y.A. Sidorenko, an official of Leningrad's Higher Party
School; S.B. Petrov, director of a sewing factory; and V.A.
Yefimov, party leader of Leningrad's Lenin region.
   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the turning point of the meeting came
when general contractor I.D. Spassky warned that if the party
doesn't start showing it can solve citizens' problems, it can
expect more of the same.
   ``People want to live better today,'' he said. ``The process of
renewal of the economy at the least must move in parallel with
political changes, but the prosperity of the people should outstrip
it. Only then will the people believe us. And in the meantime, they
wait for years and lose faith in perestroika.''
   Across the nation in the Soviet Far East, Khabarovsk Communist
Party chief V.S. Pasternak blamed his loss on the late President
Leonid I. Brezhnev and his corrupt cronies. In an interview with
Izvestia, Pasternak said people were sick of commands, and looked
at all party leaders with the same distrust.
   Pasternak said a leaflet was circulated in Khabarovsk that said,
``A vote for Pasternak means a vote for the party which led our
motherland into this dead end and now with the help of demogogic
subterfuges, is trying to convince people it can lead them out of
this situation.''

<HEAD>Holiest Moslem Month of Fasting Starts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslems in several countries began a dawn
to dusk fast Thursday, a daily religious ritual that will last for
the entire Islamic month of Ramadan.
   The fasting in Islam's holiest month is one of the major
sacraments of the faith for the world's 1 billion Moslems. The
month marks the time when the Angel Gabriel inspired the Prophet
Mohammed to write the Koran, or Moslem holy book, according to
Islam.
   Saudi Arabian King Fahd, custodian of Islam's holiest shrines at
Mecca and Medina, and Crown Prince Abdullah concentrated on the
bloodshed in Lebanon in their annual Ramadan message.
   They appealed to the warring Lebanese Christians and Syrian and
Druse Moslem militiamen ``to achieve the peace that all heavenly
religions have prescribed to spare human bloodshed and to preserve
the dignity of man.''
   Travelers, soldiers at war and pregnant women are exempt from
the fast, which traditionally starts when the crescent moon marking
a new month in the Islamic lunar calendar is sighted by the naked
eye.
   Saudi Arabia announced late Wednesday that sightings had been
reported to a special religious council, and therefore the holy
month would start Thursday.
   Moslems also started fasting in Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Israel, Libya, Tunisia and Sudan.
   In Egypt, where the oldest Islamic theology university of
Al-Azhar is located, the responsible religious council calculated
the preceding Moslem month would end Thursday, starting Ramadan on
Friday. Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Iraq, North and South Yemen, Morocco
and Algeria have made similar announcements.
   The Sultanate of Oman has to wait for its council to look for
the crescent.
   Iran, dominated by the Shiite minority sect of Islam, usually
starts Ramadan a day after all others. The predominant sect of
Islam is Sunni.
   In Lebanon, Ramadan falls along sectarian lines. The 800,000
Sunnis, following Saudi Arabia, started fasting Thursday. The
Shiites, Lebanon's largest sect with 1 million members, will follow
Iran and start Friday.

   A government newspaper Thursday praised Poland's
communist authorities and Solidarity for displaying common sense in
an agreement that it said legalizes the union while challenging it
to act constructively.
   ``Common sense came out on top,'' the newspaper Izvestia said,
telling its readers that in Poland the ``participation of the
opposition in the official political life of the country has become
a fact.''
   The Soviet Union has watched the legalization of opposition
forces in its allies Hungary and Poland while its own Communist
Party continues to tolerate no challengers. One controversial
figure, former Moscow party boss Boris N. Yeltsin, is under
investigation by the party on charges that he supports a multiparty
system.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh, asked about the
developments in Poland, said the Soviet Union was watching a
process it considered an internal Polish affair.
   ``We wish that dialogue to lead to results or developments that
could improve the situation in Poland so that the life of the
Polish people can be brought back to normal,'' Gremitskikh said.
   The conclusion of negotiations in Poland was reported by Radio
Moscow and by the Tass news agency, but Izvestia gave its millions
of readers a much more detailed account that included the formation
of a second chamber of the parliament, legalization of Solidarity
and other key changes.
   The agreement, reached Wednesday, gives Poland its first
democratic elections since World War II.
   It said the agreement would not have been possible without
reforms carried out by the Polish Communist Party in the last eight
years, but that Solidarity also showed a realistic attitude.
   The agreement ``would not have been possible without the
political will which the opposition began to show at last during
the middle of last year,'' Izvestia said.
   ``The opposition has taken on a new role for itself, one that is
quite difficult psychologically. Up to now its main strength was
negative, resisting the system, criticizing all and everything.''
Izvestia said.
   ``Now, in the conditions of legal activity it has to clearly
formulate its program, speak out with concrete ideas, be in full
view, consistently, become an object of evaluation and criticism,''
it said.
   ``It is one thing to be able to destroy, instigate strikes and
interfere with reforms, and something else entirely to create, to
assist in the framework of general responsibility, positive
processes,'' it said.
   Izvestia said it still was not clear whether Solidarity was
inclined to cooperate with authorities.
   Earlier, Radio Moscow reported the agreement in an
English-language news broadcast, but only an alert listener could
realize that Solidarity's legal status had been restored.
   The news report said Solidarity had taken part in the
negotiations and they produced a number of political agreements,
including one ``which states trade union pluralism.''
   The announcer said the participants also agreed on
``establishment of a two-chamber parliament and the post of a
president with broad powers.'' It did not mention that the
parliament would be the result of the first democratic elections
since World War II.
   The Tass news agency said only the talks involving Walesa had
ended and gave no further details of the agreement.

   African finance ministers seeking
an alternative to harsh Western prescriptions for their ailing
economies opened a four-day conference Thursday on a gloomy note.
   Adebayo Adedeji, head of the U.N. Economic Commission for
Africa, said that unless dramatic measures are taken to lift the
continent from its economic doldrums, Africa will suffer another
decade of ``economic retrogression and unmitigated disaster.''
   The conference is being held under the commission's auspices at
its headquarters in Ethiopia'a capital and will consider a draft
proposal of an African alternative to the conventional structural
adjustment programs of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund.
   The African alternative would place more emphasis on social
programs, an emphasis underdeveloped nations long have sought. Many
argue that demands for austerity by Western lending institutions
lead to the kind of social upheavals that hit Venezuela last month.
   Africa claims 28 of the world's poorest and least developed
countries, nations whose per capita debt almost equals their per
capita income. The continent's external debt grew to $230 billion
in 1988.

   The body of a woman buried about 400
years ago has been found preserved in a wood coffin with documents
and clothing intact, according to officials in a provincial city.
   Kwak Byong-man, 40, was moving the casket of an ancestor to a
new burial site when he discovered the centuries-old coffin, said
officials in Taegu, south of Seoul.
   The coffin had a two-layered lid that required six men to pry
open, officials said. It contained a well-preserved female body,
officials said, as well as traditional Korean clothing and
documents written in both Korean Hangul and Chinese characters.
   Officials said the discovery of the documents was particularly
meaningful to scholars, and they will be used to study customs of
the time.

   Florida's chief justice today appointed
a retired judge to preside over an appeal hearing for a man who
state officials agree was unfairly convicted of killing his
stepdaughter more than 20 years ago.
   The state Supreme Court refused Wednesday to release James J.
Richardson, 53, a former farm worker who claims he was framed in
the 1967 poisoning deaths of his seven children in Arcadia, about
35 miles east of Sarasota.
   But the court cleared way for a hearing that could lead to
Richardson's freedom, and Chief Justice Raymond Ehrlich named
retired Judge Clifton M. Kelly of Sebring to conduct the hearing.
   The order Wednesday relinquished the Supreme Court's
jurisdiction over the case.
   ``It all means we are at last unblocking the clogged up pipeline
and we are now going to get some action,'' said Ellis Rubin, one of
Richardson's attorneys. ``This may be the beginning of the end.''
   Richardson was convicted only of killing the oldest of the
children, an 8-year-old stepdaughter, and sentenced to die in the
electric chair. His sentence was commuted to life in prison after
the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the death penalty in 1972.
   An investigation ordered by the governor's office concluded last
month that the prosecution withheld vital evidence from the
defense, and Attorney General Bob Butterworth determined Richardson
received an unfair trial.
   The children died after eating a lunch tainted with a pesticide.
The lunch was served by a neighbor who was babysitting while
Richardson and his wife were working in an orange grove.

   The Bush administration has chosen Peter
Tomsen, deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, as a special
presidential envoy with the rank of ambassador to the Afghanistan
resistance, adminstration sources said today.
   Tomsen will be stationed in Washington, said the official, who
spoke on condition he not be named.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh
said reports that the United States named an envoy to Afghan rebels
showed that U.S. officials planned to break relations with
Afghanistan and recognize a rebel government-in-exile.
   Tomsen will report to senior State Department officials rather
than Robert Oakley, the U.S. ambassador in Pakistan, who had sought
to maintain responsibility for Afghan as well as Pakistani affairs,
said a report on the envoy published in The Washington Post.
   Department officials had sought to win the job for an area
specialist, the report said.
   Sen. Gordon J. Humphrey, R-N.H., the leading congressional
advocate of naming such an envoy, told the Post he was generally
pleased with the decision by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
even though his own candidate for the job _ Zalmy Khalilzad, an
Afghan-born scholar now with the Rand Corp. _ was not named.
   ``Anything is better than nothing,'' said Humphrey. ``Time is of
the essence now. All the bold (diplomatic) strokes are coming from
the Kabul government. We've got to gain the initiative.''

   Leftist guerrillas today
attacked the 4th army brigade headquarters and the headquarters of
army engineers. At least six people died and 10 were wounded,
authorities said.
   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, commander of the 4th brigade in El
Paraiso, 40 miles north of San Salvador, said three soldiers and
three guerrillas were killed in the pre-dawn attack. Lopez said
five soldiers were wounded.
   He said the rebels did not penetrate the brigade's perimeter but
that several of their mortars landed inside.
   The rebel's clandestine Radio Venceremos said the attack lasted
two hours and was ``a success.'' It did not mention casualties.
   Guerrilla troops also attacked the headquarters of the military
engineers in Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of San Salvador.
   Col. Benjamin Canjura, post commander, said five civilians were
wounded when homemade guerrilla artillery fell short of the
military installation. He said there were no military casualties.
   Both he and Lopez spoke in telephone interviews with The
Associated Press.
   An air force helicopter and an O-2 ``push-and-pull''
reconnaissance aircraft fitted with machine guns and rockets for
air support attacked retreating guerrilla forces on the slopes of
Chinchontepec Volcano north of the city, witnesses said.
   In another development, a man who identified himself as an urban
guerrilla of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front called
the local Sonora radio station Wednesday to claim responsibility
for the assassination on Tuesday of a police officer in the capital.
   The caller, who claimed to speak for the Juan Castro Urban
Commandos, said the group ``would remain vigilant'' to the actions
of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, judges and members
of the Supreme Court in connection with a case implicating military
men and businessmen in an early 1980s kidnap-for-profit ring.
   The caller said guerrillas ``would take the appropriate action''
if they found anyone acting in support of those implicated in the
rightist ring.
   One of the suspects was freed Friday on orders of an outgoing
judge. The order was overturned Monday by the judge's successor.
   The suspects in the case are friends and associates of Roberto
D'Aubuisson, founder of the Alliance, which is known by its Spanish
acronym, Arena.
   The rebels have waged a nine-year war against the U.S.-supported
government. More than 70,000 Salvadorans, most of them civilians,
have been killed.
   They have stepped up attacks recently to protest the recent
election of right-wing businessman Alfredo Cristiani to the
presidency.
   They threatened to present Cristiani with ``an ungovernable
country'' when he takes office June 1. Cristiani was the candidate
of Arena in the March 19 election.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev hopped from
his limousine outside Westminster Abbey on Thursday to chat and
shake hands with cheering onlookers who had waited 90 minutes in
the cold rain to see him.
   ``I was the first person to shake his hand,'' said Tim Haggarty
of Londonderry, Northern Ireland. ``This is the best day in my
entire life. He's a hero.''
   Gorbachev sent his security men dashing in all directions when
he decided, apparently on impluse, to stop his motorcade only a few
yards from the abbey's Great West Door and greet about a dozen
people in the crowd of several hundred waiting across the street.
Many were encouraging him with shouts of ``Mikhail!''
   Haggarty, 23, said he studied the Soviet leader's schedule for
his 40-hour visit to Britain and concluded the only opportunity
Gorbachev would have to meet the people would be after laying a
wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior.
   ``I think he must really know that we love him,'' Haggarty said.
``What he's doing is so wonderful. He's trying to create peace in
the world. He has to be treated like the hero he is.''
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, also spoke with Mark Frankham of
Croydon on the southern outskirts of London, and told the
13-year-old: ``Thank you very much for the reception.''
   Mark, who was with his mother, Gloria, said: ``I never expected
him to come over as there were so many police around. He was
already in his car but he got out and came across. I am thrilled.
It will be something to tell my school friends.''
   In a 15-minute ceremony inside the 900-year-old abbey, Gorbachev
and two Soviet soldiers laid the wreath of red carnations on the
tomb containing the remains of an uknown British soldier killed in
France in World War I.
   ``This has been a very significant event here,'' Gorbachev told
a Soviet journalist. His remarks were translated into English for
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who accompanied him.
   ``It reminds all of us of our common responsibilities. It
reminds all of us that we should do our best in order to prevent
new victims so that all the sacrifice of our people may not have
been in vain _ I mean particularly the soldiers fallen in those
battles.''
   The dean of Westminster Abbey, the Very Rev. Michael Mayne,
welcomed Gorbachev, saying: ``All those who long for the day when
the barriers of fear and injustice which divide nations are no
more, greatly welcome and admire what you have already achieved by
way of perestroika together with the new openness in international
affairs.''
   Mayne prayed for peace and for the victims of December's
earthquake. Gorbachev canceled his trip to Britain in December when
the earthquake struck.

<TEXT>
   The amount of TV commercials aimed at children
has increased dramatically since the Reagan administration lifted
regulations on such advertising, Congress was told today at a
hearing on a bill that would reimpose restrictions on kids' TV
programs.
   Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said that the three major
television networks had steadily increased the number of minutes
per hour of advertising in children's TV shows from below the
9.5-minute limit established by the Federal Communications
Commission in 1974 to as much as 11 minutes per hour today.
   ``Prior to 1984 when the commission enforced commercial
guidelines all these networks were either at or below the 9.5
minutes per hour limit,'' Markey said. ``However, in the five short
years since the commission deregulation order, commercial time has
been on the rise with stations at two of the networks now offering
as many as 11 minutes per hour of commercial matter.''
   Markey said the government must stem the ``endless streams'' of
TV commercials on children's shows because broadcasters are not
regulating themselves.
   But the president of the Association of National Advertisers
disagreed at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce
telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
   DeWitt Helm said the bill before the House and a companion
measure before the Senate were unconstitutional and may not
actually achieve the goal of improving the quality and quantity of
children's programming.
   Helm said less advertising may lead to worse programs for kids
and that ``program producers must have the flexibility to determine
how best to balance the entertainment needs of the audience with
the financial requirements of good programming.''
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., a co-sponsor of the bill, lashed out
at the broadcasting representatives at the hearing and told them
that ``about 80 percent of network programming is unmitigated crap
and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.''
   He challenged them to name a single children's TV program they
could be proud of, saying they were ``miserably failing'' at what
he said was an obligation to provide quality children's TV shows.
   He said the bill that is being considered, which would impose a
limit of 10.5 minutes of advertising per hour on weekends and 12
minutes per hour on weekdays for kid's shows, was ``just piddling
on the margins'' and will not affect responsible broadcasters ``one
iota.''
   Slattery said he didn't want to paint all broadcasters with the
same brush. He said some are responsible but that ``suggestions
that the marketplace is going to take care of all these things is,
Mr. Helm, naive.''
   On Wednesday, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said the
legislation was designed to stem the ``crass commercialization'' of
children's television, where the constant din of cereal, toy and
candy ads ``is enough to make any child's _ and any parent's _ head
pound and stomach ache.''
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, a main author of the House bill, said
it was his intent ``that stations which fail to provide a
reasonable amount of quality programming with strict advertising
limits specifically for children should not only be in jeopardy of
losing, but actually lose, their licenses at renewal.''
   The legislation would require the FCC to consider how well a
broadcaster has been committed to the educational and informational
needs of children in its overall programming.
   Congress passed an indentical bill last year, but President
Reagan vetoed it.
   A number of co-sponsors spoke at a Capitol Hill news conference
and said the proposal was ``modest'' and would not harm
``responsible broadcasters.''
   Markey said the bills were adopted in cooperation with the three
major television networks, the National Association of Broadcasters
and the Association of Independent Television Stations.
   ``This legislation is needed to ensure that broadcasters treat
children as consumers of information and new ideas, not just
consumers of candy, cereal and toys,'' Markey said.
   The bill was introduced in the House by Reps. Bryant, Matthew
Rinaldo, R-N.J., and Terry Bruce, D-Ill., and had 14 co-sponsors.
   The bill has wide support from psychiatric, health and
educational groups, and has been a 20-year focus of Peggy Charren
of Action for Children's Television in Boston.
   Charren, who introduced each lawmaker at the news conference,
said the bill would impose on broadcasters the ``three Rs of
television: restriction, requirement and reporting.''
   Rinaldo, the ranking Republican on the telecommunications and
finance subcommittee, noted that the FCC in 1974 had determined
that ```basic fairness' for children ought to be observed by noting
`a clear separation ... between program content' and commercials.''
   ``It is only in the last few years _ since the FCC's
deregulation order in 1984 _ that the assumptions underlying our
bill have come into question.''

   Almost 30 years ago, a young Australian
who loved American country music died in a car accident in Sydney,
leaving behind 2,000 old 78s and boxes of correspondence with the
pioneers who had made the records.
   John Edwards never made it to America, but his collection did _
as he directed in his will. His legacy forms the nucleus of the
Southern Folklife Collection that opened this week at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   ``In the past 20 years, historians have begun to look more and
more toward folklife materials,'' said Mike Casey, an archivist of
the collection. ``They're looking to sound recordings to provide a
perspective on on the history of the South.''
   In 1983, UNC bought the Edwards collection from the University
of California at Los Angeles, where it had been greatly expanded by
acquisitions of more recordings and documents. UNC combined the
purchase with the UNC Folklore Archives to form the Southern
Folklife Collection.
   With 38,000 items dating to 1906, the collection is being touted
as one of the nation's three top resources for country music
research, joining the Country Music Foundation in Nashville, Tenn.,
and the Library of Congress.
   ``Music is highly symbolic,'' said Dan Patterson, chairman of
the folklore curriculum at UNC. ``It encodes deep statements about
your identity. It speaks of values that are woven into your life.''
   The collection includes gospel, spirituals, blues, bluegrass,
Cajun, ballads, native American, string band and country music _
everything from sermons recorded at a Primitive Baptist church to
the Skillet Lickers' recording of the fiddle tune ``Cotton-Eyed
Joe'' to Merle Travis' ``I'm Sick And Tired Of You, Little
Darling.''
   Researchers, musicians and other visitors also have access to
books, videotapes and scrapbooks. Booths are available for
listening to the tapes, and there's a sound studio to erase many of
the flaws on old recordings.
   The people who have gathered in Chapel Hill through Saturday to
mark the opening of the collection include musicians and the
researchers and music professionals who have documented their lives.
   A concert Friday night will feature performers such as Etta
Baker, a blues guitarist; Wade Mainer, who in the 1920s was one of
the first stars of country music; and Esteban Jordan, a Texan who
calls himself the ``Jimi Hendrix of the accordion.''
   Another scheduled proformer is Y Ngong Knul, a 67-year-old from
Cambodia now living in Greensboro who performs a ritualized form of
chanting. He symbolizes a musical direction that may be part of the
traditional Southern music of tomorrow.
   ``There's starting to be a number of new ethnic groups moving
into the South who have not been recorded as of yet,'' Casey said.
``They're Hispanic and they're Vietnamese ... and they're playing
their music.
   ``It's clearly not what what we've consider Southern traditional
music up till now,'' he said. ``But the fact is ... in the next 100
years, it will be, and it's important to document it.''

<HEAD>North Korea Chides Seoul's Move to Arrest Dissident Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea's official media on Thursday warned
South Korea not to arrest a dissident clergyman who secretly
visited the communist country for talks on reunifying the Korean
peninsula.
   The Seoul government ``should know clearly what consequences ...
its foolish scheme to arrest and punish Rev. Moon Ik-hwan (will)
bring on its lot,'' said a commentary in the Workers (Communist)
Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun.
   North Korea on Wednesday threatened to break off an already
fractured dialogue with Seoul if Moon is arrested when he returns
home from an unauthorized, nine-day visit to Pyongyang via Japan
and China.
   Moon, an adviser to South Korea's main dissident United National
Democratic Movement, arrived Wednesday in Tokyo and said he plans
to return home by April 14.
   His visit, the first by a South Korean dissident, broke
regulations requiring South Koreans to obtain government permission
before they travel to North Korea.
   South Koreans were angered by televised scenes of Moon hugging
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung, whom they blame for the 1950-53
Korean War. Korea was divided at the end of World War II in 1945.
   Seoul officials say Moon helped Pyongyang discredit their
government's authority.
   Moon told reporters in Tokyo he went to Pyongyang to contribute
to unification through non-governmental contacts. But he also said
he met only communist leaders and some of his relatives living in
the north.
   Rodong Sinmun said: ``As Rev. Moon Ik-hwan already stated, his
Pyongyang visit this time was aimed at deepening trust between the
people in the North and the South, jointly seeking a reasonable way
of reunification and promoting peace.''
   Moon's arrest would ``deliberately aggravate North-South
relations and lay a new obstacle in the way,'' it said.
   The nations are involved in a variety of contacts ranging from a
possible non-aggression pact to trade and cultural exchanges. Some
have stalled over North Korean protests about recently concluded
U.S.-South Korean military exercises.

<HEAD>Bush Plans To Extend Economic Sanctions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush plans to extend for one year
the economic sanctions President Reagan imposed on the Panamanian
government controlled by military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega, an
administration source said today.
   The current economic, trade and military sanctions expire on
April 8. Bush was expected to act as early as today or Friday to
keep them in place for year.
   In the package that is currently being prepared for Bush's
signature, the sanctions remain the same as the ones already in
place.
   ``After the election we'll take a look at the situation there
and see if there's any cause for change,'' said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The sanctions imposed under executive order by Reagan a year ago
involve restrictions on U.S. businesses who have developed a
flourishing business with Panama, as well as a cutoff of military
aid to the Central American nation.
   The sanctions include blocking assets of the government of
Panama in the United States and prohibiting tax payments by U.S.
organizations to the Noriega regime.
   The administration is closely looking to Panama's upcoming
elections which are scheduled for May 7.
   It is anticipated that Noriega, who is accused in a federal drug
running case in Miami, will control the process because he controls
the electoral tribunal and the media that otherwise might provide
opposition candidates a better chance to get their messages out.
   Noriega as chief of the Defense Forces is de facto ruler of
Panama.
   ``If the Panamanian people have a chance to express their will
in a free and open manner, we're confident Noriega will go,'' said
the source, who acknowledged however, that prospects for that
appeared rocky.
   The military promised the opposition Authentic Panamanian Party
that the elections will be clean.
   The Democratic Alliance, a coalition of the opposition
Democratic Christian, Liberal and Liberal Republican Nationalist
Movement parties, has Guillermo Endara as its presidential
candidate.
   Noriega has been Panama's de facto leader since February 1988,
when he orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
The president had tried to fire Noriega as military leader after
Noriega was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug trafficking charges.
Noriega denied the charges.
   Washington continues to recognize Delvalle as president and
imposed economic sanctions against Panama in an effort to force
Noriega out.

   A train derailed today and hit tanks
containing farm pesticides and fertilizers, releasing chemical
fumes that forced evacuation of 1,300 students from nearby schools
and injured one person, police said.
   The train, carrying grain, ran off the tracks at 8:30 a.m. at
Princeton Fertilizer, said police officer Dorothy Mowery.
   The spreading fumes forced the precautionary evacuation of
Princeton Community High School and Brumfield Elementary School,
less than one-half mile downwind, superintendent Ed Swan said.
   Homes within two miles of the site were also evacuated, Mowery
said.
   A female employee of the adjacent Cargill Grain Elevator,
Princeton Fertilizer's parent company, was being treated at Gibson
General Hospital, emergency room nurse Judy Morgan said.
   ``She's suffering from skin irritation, mucus membrane
irritation and eye irritation,'' Morgan said. The woman's name was
not released.
   The students, taken to Princeton Middle School, were told at
10:30 a.m. that it was safe to return.

<TEXT>
   American Airlines said today it will expand service
to Miami and the Caribbean by 24 flights a day by June 1, filling
gaps left by strike-crippled Eastern Airlines.
   American had said late last year it would expand in Florida, but
the strike pushed its planning schedule ahead.
   ``Obviously the opportunity that Eastern's problem presented
brought us to take a look at the timing of that plan,'' said Robert
Baker, American's senior vice president for operations. ``It was
probably a year down the road. The Caribbean part was closer than
that.''
   American will add 600 employees in Miami. The airline's expanded
presence will represent another $100 million a year to the local
economy.
   The growth in Florida and the Caribbean will add 3,219 seats a
day to the market. New routes from Miami will include nonstop
flights to Los Angeles, New York and Boston.
   New service to the Caribbean will include stops in San Juan,
Puerto Rico and Kingston and Montego Bay in Jamaica, Santo Domingo
and Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic as well as
Port-Au-Prince, Haiti.
   The Caribbean additions will link 14 cities served by American
with the Caribbean hub in San Juan.
   In Miami, American is expanding its daily service from 20 to 31
flights a day. In San Juan, the number of daily flights will rise
from 45 to 52.
   Eastern service represented about a quarter of the seats from
the United States to Jamaica and about a third of the seats to the
U.S. Virgin Islands before the strike.
   ``None of what we have announced today will rise and fall on
what happens to Eastern Airlines or anyone else,'' Baker said.
``Eastern's been in a lot of (the cities). They've been a big guy
here.''
   ``The likelihood is that Eastern will still be the largest
carrier'' in the region, he added.
   American is upgrading its fleet, switching to larger aircraft on
12 flights to the Caribbean to increase its capacity. Direct
service from other U.S. cities to the Caribbean is part of the
airline's plan.

   Britain will build a school in Armenia to replace
one of the many lost in December's earthquake, Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said Thursday after talks with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The school, which will be designed to withstand earthquakes,
will be built for 400 children between age six and 16 in Leninakan,
one of the towns hardest hit by the Dec. 7 earthquake.
   Signing memoranda of understanding with Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher
announced ``the gift of a school to the people of Armenia who
suffered so much in the earthquake.
   ``As you probably know, 5,000 children were killed ... during
that earthquake and of course thousands and thousands were left
without schools,'' she said.
   ``When we asked the people of Armenia what they would like as a
gift, they said a school,'' Mrs. Thatcher said following more than
two hours of talks with Gorbachev.
   She and Gorbachev signed the papers in front of several
industrialists whose companies, along with a charity called Aid
Armenia and the Department of Education, financed the project.
   Upon his departure from Mrs. Thatcher's official residence,
Gorbachev told reporters he wanted to thank the British ``for
reaching out to the people of Armenia ... in those days (after the
earthquake).''
   ``That tragic situation also showed that we can be together,
that we can work together when there is understanding, where there
is trust, when there is a good atmosphere in relations between the
two nations,'' he said.
   Work on the school is to begin next month and it is to be
completed by the 1990-91 school year.
   It will cost about $7 million, said an education spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``I am delighted that British skills and technology are being
used in this way to the benefit of the people hit by this terrible
disaster,'' said Education Secretary Kenneth Baker.
   Companies contributing to the school included British Petroleum
Co. PLC., British Steel Corp., Cable and Wireless PLC., Coloroll
Group PLC., GEC Ltd. and Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd.

<HEAD>Former Spandau Guard Convicted of Stealing Goods from Rudolf Hess</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court on Thursday convicted a former guard at
Spandau Prison of stealing valuables from the late Nazi war
criminal Rudolf Hess at the prison.
   Stephen Timson, a former guard at the Allies' prison in West
Berlin, also was found guilty of attempting to coerce money from
Hess' son, Munich architect Wolf Ruediger Hess, by demanding the
equivalent of $267,000 for the return of the goods.
   Timson, of Britain, was given a suspended two-year sentence with
probation but was told he would have to serve a year in jail if he
violated terms of the probation.
   His British brother-in-law, Paul Warman, was fined about $1,070
for involvement in the attempts to sell the valuables.
   Timson, 33, admitted taking Hess' World War II flight uniform,
watches, and other valuables dating back to the Nazi era while a
guard at Spandau.
   But Timson also maintained he ``found'' the items stashed in a
blue garbage bag in a prison storage room.
   He told the court, ``It was a stupid idea from beginning to end.
I won't do anything like this ever again.''
   Timson and Warman were arrested in a Hamburg hotel on Dec. 10,
1988, as they met with Hess' son to close the deal.
   Rudolf Hess, former deputy to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, died in
Spandau Prison on Aug. 17, 1987. at the age of 93 while serving a
life sentence. His death was ruled a suicide.

   A commuter train carrying 98 people today

suffered minor injuries.
   Four cars and the Metra train's locomotive derailed at 7:15

Rounds.
   Trains between Chicago and Springfield and Chicago and St. Louis

   Three of the four crew members were among the 58 people given
medical attention at the scene, and 42 were taken to five hospitals
for treatment of minor injuries and-or observation, said Chris
Knapton, a spokesman for the Metra commuter rail line in Chicago.
   The accident caused at least $1 million in damage to equipment,
including one passenger car that was destroyed, Knapton said.

<TEXT>
   Venezuela's top military court has
overturned a lower court decision and freed 19 policemen and
soldiers implicated in the slayings of 14 fishermen on the border
with Colombia.
   A lawyer for the families of the victims called Wednesday's
decision ``inconceivable.''
   The Oct. 29 slayings had prompted four days of student riots in
Caracas and elsewhere in which news reports said at least one
person was killed and at least 57 were wounded. Church groups and
human rights organizations worldwide sent letters of protest to the
government.
   The soldiers had claimed the fishermen had been Colombian
guerrillas killed in a firefight, but nearby villagers and two
survivors of the attack denied the claim and said the fishermen
were ambushed while on a Sunday picnic.
   An autopsy showed that many of the dead men had been shot in the
back of the head at close range.
   The court president, Gen. Daniel de Jesus Palacios, said his
tribunal had decided Wednesday to overturn a lower military court's
previous decision in January to jail the men, part of a
military-police border task force.
   A lawyer for the families of the dead men, Fabian Chacon,
criticized the ruling.
   ``There is an unmasked intention on the part of the court to
favor the men on trial, which goes to show that in Venezuela there
are obstacles and structures that make justice impossible,'' Chacon
told reporters outside the judge's chambers.
   The 19 policemen and soldiers had been held in the city of San
Cristobal, about 400 miles southwest of Caracas.
   The lower military court had ordered their arrest and reversed
another court that had ordered the arrest of two surviving
fishermen for ``military rebellion.''
   The two survivors, Wolmer Pinilla and Jose Arias, then fled to
Mexico, where they received political asylum.
   Villagers of El Amparo denied the men were guerrillas, and said
they were all fishermen out for a Sunday picnic when they were
ambushed by the soldiers.
   The military court's latest decision frees the imprisoned men
and sends the case back to where it stood before the decision to
imprison them, said de Jesus.
   It was unclear whether Pinilla and Arias, who later returned to
Venezuela, would now be guilty of ``military rebellion'' and liable
for arrest again.
   Military rebellion is often a term used to justify detaining
people without charges, according to the human rights group Amnesty
International.
   The decision follows widespread riots in February over
government economic reforms that left at least 270 dead by official
estimates. Unofficial sources say that death toll was as high as
2,000.

<HEAD>Employers' Group Calls For Importation of Labor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federation of Hong Kong employers urged the
government Thursday to import foreign laborers to ease Hong Kong's
acute labor shortage.
   The group, called the Joint Associations Working Group, said it
was essential to import contract laborers to avoid inflation and
falling economic competitiveness.
   Hong Kong needs about 50,000 imported workers, most of them
unskilled, to help fill an estimated 200,000 job vacancies, it said.
   The group's chairman, Martin Barrow, an executive at Jardine
Matheson Holdings Ltd., said there was danger Hong Kong could lose
it ``competitiveness in the manufacturing sector, the hotel
industry and elsewhere'' because of the shortage of workers.
   The government said Tuesday it is considering easing
restrictions on employment of foreign laborers. Under current
policy, only foreign workers with skills not available locally are
allowed to work in the colony.
   Hong Kong's low unemployment rate, currently 1.3 percent, is
considered a key factor behind the economy's growth slowing to an
expected 6 percent this year, less than half the 1987 rate.
   The labor shortage is due to tight immigration laws and a steady
drain of talent as the colony approaches its return to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
   The report said the government should encourage automation and
productivity through tax breaks and reducing red tape. It said
bringing in workers on six-month to two-year contracts, similar to
practices in Singapore, would provide relief.
   The group also suggested the possibility of Hong Kong using
workers who would commute daily from China.

<HEAD>Grant Will Help Veterans Pay Living Expenses While Under Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE MAJOR HOLMES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Until now, Vietnam veterans who came
here to be treated for post-traumatic stress disorder were likely
to encounter another kind of stress _ figuring out how to pay for
living expenses during their seven-week stay.
   That's about to change.
   The Mid-Rio Grande chapter of the American Red Cross has been
awarded more than $100,000 to help veterans and their families from
New Mexico, Arizona and parts of Texas pay rent and food costs
while they are treated at an outpatient clinic at the Veterans
Administration Medical Center here.
   The Red Cross hopes to serve about 70 veterans and their
families during the one-year project, said Marjorie Waters, the Red
Cross chapter's administrator of emergency services and disaster
programs.
   ``I want it to be the tip of the iceberg kind of thing, where it
could be increased,'' said Mrs. Waters, who hopes the grant will be
renewed.
   ``We can reach them and help them into this (treatment) program
that they would not be able to take part in if they had to worry
about paying the rent or that basic kind of thing,'' she said.
   The Red Cross was one of eight agencies nationwide awarded Agent
Orange Class Assistance grants totaling more than $581,000 to help
them serve Vietnam veterans and their families.
   The March 30 awards were the first disbursements to service
agencies from the settlement of a 1978 lawsuit against seven
manufacturers of Agent Orange. In their class-action lawsuit,
veterans alleged they got cancer and other illnesses because of
exposure to the defoliant used by the military in Southeast Asia in
the 1960s.
   The $240 million settlement, upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court
last year, provides $170 million to be paid directly to U.S.
veterans or their survivors; $52 million to agencies that serve
veterans and their families; plus lesser amounts for veterans of
other countries who served in Vietnam and for legal and
administrative fees.
   The grants to service agencies were designed to reach veterans
and their families who do not meet the eligibility requirements for
direct payments, which are reserved for disabled veterans. The
grants are not limited to agencies that treat Agent Orange-related
problems.
   The $52 million fund for agencies is expected to grow with
interest to $70million over the seven- to 10-year life of the
program.
   Mrs. Waters said the idea for rental and food assistance came
because veterans from outside Albuquerque contacted the local Red
Cross for money to pay living expenses while in the city seeking
treatment.
   ``It's been in my mind for a couple of years because we helped
veterans when we could from Red Cross funding when they were here
for the program,'' she said. ``They came and said they were taking
part in the program and didn't have any more money for rent or gas
or food.''
   She said the grant ``really was a godsend'' because the Red
Cross wasn't able to meet all the needs of the veterans it heard
from.
   The chapter applied for $102,000 based on an estimate of
veterans in the clinic and the chapter's experience in paying rent
and food costs for homeless people, Ms. Waters said.
   Diane Castillo, coordinator of the VA treatment program, said
she expects the grant will increase the number of veterans in the
program from outside the Albuquerque area.
   ``A major problem with any guys coming in from anywhere was the
need for them to commute daily,'' she said.
   The clinic, which began operating in 1987, combines individual
and group psychotherapy. Staff members try to avoid using
medication because chemicals are only an artificial way of dealing
with anxiety, Castillo said.
   ``We directly address the patient's traumatic experience, bring
back that event to the patient, then work through the feelings
they've suppressed for the last 20 years,'' she said.
   The program, which she described as ``fairly intense,'' also
includes counseling for married couples, anger management, problem
solving and social skills, Castillo said.
   The clinic has treated about 150 veterans and can handle 85 to
100 a year, she said.

   The fired captain of the Exxon Valdez
walked out of jail today after a judge reduced his bail from $1
million to $25,000, calling the higher amount ``unconstitutionally
excessive.''
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood posted bail, walked out of the Suffolk
County jail at 12:59 p.m. and got into a waiting car with attorney
Thomas Russo and another lawyer. He did not speak and showed no
emotion as he walked off.
   On Wednesday, another judge set bail for Hazelwood at $1 million
bond or $500,000 cash, comparing the effect of the oil tanker wreck
in Alaska to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
   Justice Thomas Stark, the supervising judge of Suffolk County
Criminal Court, today reduced the bail to $25,000 bond or cash.
   ``The amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of
the crime or the effect of the crime on the community,'' Stark said
of the figure that had shocked even prosecutors.
   ``We can't take out our wrath on one individual,'' said District
Attorney Patrick Henry, whose office originally had requested
$25,000 bail.
   Hazelwood, who faces three misdemeanor charges in Alaska, is
accused of being drunk when he relinquished command of the Exxon
Valdez to an uncertified seaman. The vessel then hit a reef March
24, gushing 10.1 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William
Sound and creating North America's worst oil spill.
   Judge Kenneth Rohl, a naturalist who comes from a family of
professional seamen, set Hazelwood's bail Wednesday at $1 million
bond or $500,000 cash.
   ``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been
equaled, at least in this country,'' Rohl said. ``He's got to think
about that. We have a man-made destruction that has not been
equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.''
   The U.S. bombing of Hiroshima at the end of World War II killed
or injured nearly 130,000 people and leveled 90 percent of the
Japanese city. No human life has been lost in the oil spill.
   Dean Guaneli, Alaska's assistant attorney general, said the bail
order ``expresses the nation's outrage at what has happened.''
   A pale, shaken Hazelwood, whose lawyer had sought $5,000 cash
bail, was led from Rohl's courtroom in handcuffs after his
arraignment on the fugitive warrant.
   ``It was tough for our client to hear,'' said defense attorney
Michael Chalos. ``It was very harsh, we thought.''
   Hazelwood was taken to the Suffolk County Jail. He was granted
30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing.
   Authorities in Alaska have charged him with operating a ship
while drunk, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil.
He faces 2\ years in prison if convicted.
   Hazelwood, 42, of Huntington, N.Y., was fired by Exxon last week
after the National Transportation Safety Board said tests taken
about nine hours after the Good Friday disaster showed he was under
the influence of alcohol.
   Rohl said that even though Hazelwood faces only misdemeanors,
``We are not talking about someone breaking someone's windshield.
We are talking about a global catastrophe.''
   Russo said his client was no fugitive because ``he left Alaska
before any charges had been filed against him.''
   ``No one is saying this is not a tragedy,'' Russo said, but
added: ``Captain Hazelwood is not guilty of these crimes. He did
not commit any criminal acts in this affair.''
   Hazelwood, who had shaven off his beard, appeared pale and
despondent after the judge's tongue-lashing. When officers put
handcuffs on him his hands were sweating and shaking.

<HEAD>Many Taxpayers Not Adjusting to New Law, IRS Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many taxpayers are having trouble giving up
lucrative deductions that were repealed or curtailed by the 1986
tax overhaul.
   A spot check by the Internal Revenue Service of returns filed
last year and early this year shows evidence of widespread
non-compliance with parts of the new law. These include limitations
on writing off investment and personal interest, on miscellaneous
deductions such as union dues and on the treatment of rental losses.
   The IRS made the disclosure in announcing Thursday that it has
broadened efforts to gauge how well taxpayers understand and comply
with the new law.
   ``Recognizing that the 1986 act represents the most
comprehensive change to the federal tax system in a quarter century
and contained changes affecting almost every taxpayer, the IRS will
use the studies to assist taxpayers to better understand the new
laws and help determine to what extent taxpayers are trying to
circumvent various provisions of the new law,'' the agency said.
   The IRS is so concerned about public reaction to the new law
that it has set up teams in each of its 10 regional service centers
to spot check returns as they are filed. Without such checks, the
agency would have to wait until 1991 for comprehensive information
from a sizable number of returns.
   A check of several thousand returns filed in 1988, the first
year affected significantly by the new law, disclosed that many
taxpayers did not follow tougher rules on treatment of losses from
passive investments, rental losses, investment interest expenses
and miscellaneous itemized deductions.
   Rick Hayes, head of audit planning for the IRS, said those
issues were chosen as targets of the new effort because they
involve large amounts of revenue, show up on many returns and were
all changed significantly by the 1986 law.
   The first of about 150,000 returns filed this year that are
expected to undergo spot checks show those same errors are being
repeated. In addition, Hayes said in an interview, many returns
being filed this year attempted to avoid the reduction in the
writeoff of consumer interest, in the deduction for
business-related meals and entertainment and in depreciation of
automobiles.
   In the past, the IRS generally would discover such
non-compliance only through a formal audit, which usually would
come about two years after a return was filed. With the new effort,
the agency hopes to spot trends of non-compliance early and follow
quickly with a campaign to educate the public.
   If the effort is successful, the IRS expects to see fewer
taxpayers making these mistakes and fewer returns being audited on
those issues.
   ``We want to fix as many of these things as we can without doing
audits on people,'' Hayes said. ``If we can do these as part of
(returns) processing, that's what we want to do.''
   The IRS has not yet estimated how much money is being lost by
the government because of non-compliance with the 1986 tax changes.
Hayes said the spot checks are likely to find numerous cases in
which taxpayers cheated themselves by misreading parts of the new
law. Those taxpayers will be notified, he emphasized.
   Information from the spot checks will be used to determine
whether the IRS needs to change its tax forms, instructions or
publications to clear up confusion resulting from the law changes,
Hayes said.

<HEAD>1989 Predicted Worst Year Yet For Soviet Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is facing its toughest year yet
and could degenerate into ``economic chaos'' without urgent
reforms, a newspaper said Thursday.
   ``The bony hand of hunger for products is quite capable of
strangling perestroika,'' the Soviet program of economic
restructuring, journalist Vasily Selyunin wrote in a front-page
article in the daily Socialist Industry.
   By putting off painful reforms, economists are ruining the
chances for those reforms to succeed, said Selyunin, who
specializes in economic affairs.
   He cited the need to deal urgently with the Soviet budget
deficit and shortages of consumer goods. Selyunin's calls for more
rapid economic change have appeared in other top journals.
   The sooner real reform is introduced the better, ``because
otherwise we'll have to be introducing economic reform under the
conditions of economic chaos,'' he said.
   The government could have begun raising prices on plentiful,
easily substituted items, but it is too late because virtually
everything is in short supply, he said.
   An institute on consumer demand found that 211 food products,
only 23 could be bought freely, he said. The rest require
connections with the sellers, overpayment or are rationed.
   Strategists promise tough reforms after an initial period of
heightened output of consumer goods, but there is no reason to
expect any such increase, Selyunin said.
   ``On the contrary, one can expect that the year 1989 will be the
most unsuccessful of all those we have lived through,'' he said.
   Along with the announced budget deficit of $58 billion and an
additional $102 billion in loans to state enterprises that are
losing money, the unexpected expense of earthquakes in Armenia and
Tadzhikistan will cripple the 1989 economy even further, Selyunin
said.
   He said inflation is running at 4 percent to 5 percent annually,
much higher than official figures.
   ``Today we have to choose between only two realities: either
relatively stable prices with minor inflation of about 6 percent
and empty shelves, or quickly rising prices and goods in the
stores,'' he said.
   Selyunin's prescriptions for fixing the economy included cuts in
military spending, which he placed at nearly 20 percent of national
income, and two or three years of importing giant stocks of goods
from the West.
   The imports could be sold at 10 times their cost and thus both
help to balance the state budget and satisfy consumer demand,
Selyunin proposed.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other leaders have said they
oppose such massive imports, preferring to spend money on
modernizing industry instead.

<HEAD>Former Teamsters Official Tells Congress Of Mob Corruption</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former official of a Teamsters local in New
York told Congress on Thursday that area crime families controlled
union activities and finances with repeated acts of intimidation
and violence, including an attempt to murder him.
   ``I had two choices, to be a dead man or talk to the feds,''
Anthony Giliberti told a Senate panel reviewing government efforts
to rid labor unions of corruption.
   Giliberti, a former vice president of Teamsters Local 814 in New
York, has since shortly after the attempt on his life in 1982
cooperated with authorities, including testimony at a federal trial
in New York that resulted in the convictions of 12 reputed members
and associates of the Bonanno crime family.
   Local 814 is one of four union locals the government has placed
under court trusteeship through the use of federal racketeering
laws, the subject of the review of the Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations.
   Those trustees and a fifth appointed to oversee a
multimillion-dollar New York fish market that allegedly was
controlled by the Genovese crime family told the subcommittee the
procedure has proven successful in rooting out corruption although
all said those efforts were far from completed.
   Giliberti said he helped arrange mob backing of a candidate for
president of Local 814 and later won Mafia approval to force out
that man, Sal Aiello, and replace him as president with Vinnie
Bracco.
   Giliberti said among his many jobs with the union was ``shaking
down'' businesses, generally through promising them favors from the
local in return for 5 percent of the company's profits. Among the
favors was allowing companies to hire non-union workers or to hire
union workers ``off the books'' so the employer could avoid
payments to union pension and welfare funds, he said.
   Giliberti was shot outside his home in July 1982 and, after
recovering, began cooperating with investigators. He sat behind a
screen while testifying to the subcommittee, visible only to
members and staff.
   Arthur Eisenberg, appointed trustee of Local 814 in 1987
following the convictions of several of the union's board members
for labor racketeering, said the financial condition of the local's
pension, welfare and benefit funds has improved dramatically since
he took control of the union's activities.
   ``I believe RICO trusteeships can help carry out the public
policy commitment to rid labor organizations of criminal
infiltration and control,'' Eisenberg said.
   Concurring in that opinion was Edwin H. Stier, trustee of
Teamsters Local 560 in Union City, N.J., which was placed under
trusteeship in 1986 after a trial featuring lengthy testimony
detailing the control of the Provenzano crime family over the local.
   The subcommittee earlier this week heard from Teamsrers
President William J. McCarthy, who said he had never had dealings
with organized crime. The hearings are to conclude next week with
testimony from AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland and Justice
Department officials concerning the appropriateness of court
intervention in union affairs.

   President Bush gave his qualified support
today to a proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to
hold elections among Palestinian Arabs as a step toward a
settlement in the Middle East.
   At the same time, Bush opposed any outcome in which Israel might
retain land it won in the 1967 Six-Day War.
   Bush said he told Shamir ``we do not support an independent
Palestinian state, nor Israeli sovereignty over or permanent
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.''
   Bush said he was confident an ``acceptable formula'' could be
devised for conducting elections in the West Bank and Gaza,
territory Israel has held since 1967.
   ``The United States believes elections in the territories can be
designed to contribute to a political process of dialogue and
negotiations,'' Bush said after meeting with Shamir for a little
more than an hour.
   But a senior U.S. official said Bush and Shamir had agreed on a
principle, not any arrangement for conducting the elections.
   ``These are principles for moving forward,'' the official told
reporters under rules that barred identifying him. ``Everyone
recognizes more needs to be done ... to put meat on the bones.''
   Shamir's proposal for elections was the main idea he brought
here as a way resolving the conflict on the West Bank and in Gaza
where Palestinians have been in rebellion for 15{ months.
   Shamir said Israel will need the cooperation of the Palestinians
in devising the electoral process, which he said would be followed
by negotiations for ``a permanent agreement'' on the Palestinian
issue.
   ``In order to launch a political negotiating process,'' Shamir
said, ``we propose free democratic elections, free from an
atmopshere of PLO violence, terror and intimidation, among the
Palestinian Arabs of Judea, Samaria and Gaza,'' he said, using the
Hebrew references to the territories. ``Their purpose is to produce
a delegation to negotiate an interim period of self-government
administration.''
   Bush, speaking first, said ``the status quo serves the interests
of no one.'' He pledged U.S. assistance in the search for a
settlement which Bush said must be based on direct negotiations
between Israel and the Arabs.
   The president, for the second time this week, insisted on an end
to what he called Israel's occupation of the territories. He also
said he did not support establishment of an independent Palestinian
state.
   Bush urged Israel to engage in ``a serious dialogue'' with
Palestinians, but did not say if he wanted Israel to talk to the
Palestine Liberation Organization, which claims to represent the
1.4 million who live on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   Shamir said the goal of the elections he proposed was
``coexistence and cooperation'' between Israel and the Palestinians
as a means to an overall settlement.
   The Israeli prime minister met for a second time today with
Secretary of State James A. Baker III before outlining for Bush his
proposals for dealing with the Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Earlier, Shamir's ideas were shrouded in secrecy. He had hinted
before arriving here that he was inclined to call elections. But
Shamir and Baker agreed at their first meeting at the State
Department on Wednesday not to disclose the substance of the prime
minister's proposals until after the White House meeting with Bush.
   Meanwhile, an aide to Shamir said the prime minister objected to
any suggestions that elections be held under international
supervision.
   The aide, Yossi Ahimeir, said Shamir rejected the idea of
foreign oversight of elections during his talks here on Wednesday.
   Ahimeir said the subject of supervision had come up in
discussions Shamir had with Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher
and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Ahimeir paraphrased Shamir as saying, ``We don't need this. ...
We are a country that has experience in handling democratic
elections.''
   The aide said Shamir proposed, as an alternative to elections,
having Egypt chose the Palestinian reprepresentatives.
   Avi Pazner, the prime minister's media adviser, said Shamir and
Baker had decided ``not to reveal anything.'' Pazner did say that a
group of Israeli and U.S. officials had convened to explore the
ideas in advance of Shamir's talk with Bush.
   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in an interview with Cable
News Network, said if Shamir holds elections without the
participation of the PLO, it ``will be a grave mistake; it will not
solve the problem.''
   Mubarak, interviewed on the NBC ``Today'' show, said Bush should
tell Shamir that ``land for peace is the main principle for
proceeding forward in the peace process.''
   Declaring that ``courage and good will'' were needed for
achieving peace in the region, Mubarak said, ``Egypt has done lots
of courageous steps for peace. ... I think it's the turn of the
Israelis to make a courageous step.''
   The Israeli leader refuses to negotiate with Yasser Arafat's
organization, which he blames for terrorism against Israel and
protests by Palestinians on the West Bank and in Gaza. So far, 419
Palestinian Arabs and 18 Israelis have been killed in 15{ months of
disturbances in the occupied territories.
   Shamir's election proposition is designed to have the
Palestinians elect representatives to negotiate with Israel on the
basis of the 1978 Camp David agreements reached with Egypt under
U.S. auspices.
   The agreements produced an Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in 1979
and called also for five years of local autonomy for the
Palestinians after which negotiations would determine their future
and that of the territories captured by Israel in the 1967 war.
   Baker, after meeting with Shamir, described their talk as ``very
productive, useful and very friendly.''
   For his part, Shamir said he had offered ``some ways to solve''
problems in the Mideast and remarked:
   ``I feel we have started a very serious discussion. Our
conversation was very friendly.''
   There were widespread expectations before Shamir's meeting with
Baker that the Bush administration would take a tough stance toward
Israel.
   Bush on Monday said he supports an eventual end to the Israeli
occupation, and a U.S. official, briefing reporters at the White
House on Tuesday under rules of anonymity, predicted a ``candid''
discussion, a diplomatic way of forecasting division.
   But Pazner told reporters afterward, ``I didn't see any
hardening of position.''
   The Israeli spokesman said Shamir wanted to move carefully, and
that while the Palestinian problem was severe, for Israel a bigger
problem ``is our relationship with the Arab world.''
   Except for Egypt, none of the Arab countries is officially at
peace with Israel. ``The threat of a war, the threat of an
explosion, comes mainly from that situation,'' Pazner said.

   Lawmakers from Britain and the United States
pronounced themselves fit and ready Thursday for a charity tennis
contest May 19 at which organizers said President Bush may put in
an appearance.
   ``You'll see tennis played like never before,'' Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., said at a news conference here. ``We are a mean,
lean and fit machine.''
   ``We will show no mercy once we're on the courts,'' John Hannam,
a conservative member of the House of Commons from Exeter, said
through a telephone hookup from London. ``We've been training here
in the shadows of Wimbledon.''
   ``I hope the Anglo-U.S. relationship will survive this ordeal,''
said Richard Ralph, a representative of the British Embassy.
   The play will be held in connection with the Dow World Senior
Open for players over 45, sceduled for May 15 to 21 at
Congressional Country Club in suburban Bethesda, Md.
   A contribution will be made to Children's Hospital National
Medical Center in the name of the winning team. The country club is
also making a $5,000 donation to the hospital through a
contribution from Dow Chemical, sponsor of the tounament, officials
of the tournament said.
   Each team will consist of eight lawmakers and two guests, and
play will include five doubles matches between congressional and
parliamentary competitors. The first team to win 13 sets will be
declared winner of the Congress-Parliament Challenge Cup and will
receive a trophy from the archives of Wimbledon, officials said.
   Breaux, the captain of the U.S. team, said members tentatively
scheduled to play include Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine; Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, the 1988 Democratic vice
presidential nominee; Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., Rep. Byron L.
Dorgan, D-N.D., and Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo. Although he listed
only Democrats, he said he is still rounding up players and hopes
to have some Republicans. He said he has also been talking to the
White House and thinks it likely that Bush will be on hand.
   Ralph said the British team will include the Marquis of Reading,
the Earl of Kinnoul and Lord St. John of Bletso from the House of
Lords. From the House of Commons it will include Hannam, Michael
Morris of Northampton, Patrick Round of Feltham and Heston, Malcolm
Moss of Cambridgeshire N.E., Tony Steen of South Hams and Tim
Sainsbury of Hove.
   They are all conservatives, but Ralph said, ``I don't think that
was by design.'' Apparently, he said, they are just better tennis
players.

<TEXT>
   With the Bush administration pushing the
Supreme Court to overturn its landmark abortion decision, abortion
advocates are converging on the nation's capital this weekend for
what they expect will be their largest demonstration.
   They believe the stakes are higher than any time since the
court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion and are determined to
pick up the gauntlet Bush has thrown down.
   ``We have been silent far too long,'' said Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   Tens of thousands of students from 500 college campuses are
coming, mothers are bringing their daughters and granddaughters, a
delegation from Capitol Hill will be there and dozens of
celebrities are flying in from Hollywood for the Sunday march,
organizers say.
   The goal is to make the weekend a turning point in the national
abortion debate. Organizers feel that anti-abortion advocates have
so far carried the day by focusing the question on when life
begins. Instead, they feel the issue is whether the government
should intervene in what they believe should be a private decision.
   ``Nobody likes abortion. It's a difficult choice and there are a
lot of issues that women have to weigh when faced with a crisis
pregnancy,'' Michelman said. ``Women don't have abortions they
want, they have abortions they need.''
   Organizers are reluctant to predict how many will turn out for
the demonstration, but they expect the number will be far larger
than the 90,000 who gathered for a March 1986 pro-abortion rally in
Washington.
   At least one anti-abortion group plans to mount a
counterdemonstration of up to 300 people on the day of the march.
   The engine revving the weekend's events is the Supreme Court and
its pending decision on a Missouri case that could reverse or
severely limit the high court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized abortion. Oral arguments in the case are scheduled for
later this month.
   The Reagan administration also pushed to overturn Roe vs. Wade
and failed. But since the issue last came before the court, two new
justices have been seated and Justice Lewis Powell, a key defender
of the 1973 decision, has retired.
   Of the newcomers, Justice Antonin Scalia is thought to favor
overturning or curtailing the decision. Justice Anthony Kennedy's
views on the ruling are not known, but some observers think there
may now be a one-vote majority for changing the law.
   ``Women have felt abortion always would be legal, but now that
it's clear there's a clear and present danger, they're
responding,'' said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the
Feminist Majority.
   The message of the march is directed at the nine justices who
will decide the case, and who organizers say are not immune to
public opinion.
   ``They understand public opinion. Everyone is influenced by
public opinion,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women. ``If the outcry and protest is loud enough
and big enough, they'll hear it.''
   The marchers also intend to send a message of disapproval to
President Bush, who as one of his first acts as president in
January addressed by telephone an anti-abortion rally of about
67,000 outside the White House.
   ``He has thrown down the gauntlet,'' Yard said.
   Plans for the demonstration include a march at noon on Sunday
from the Washington Monument down the Mall to the Capitol. On
Monday, abortion activists intend to take their message directly to
members of Congress and to legislators in states across the country.
   About 50 celebrities and entertainers are scheduled to
participate, including singer Judy Collins and actresses Cybill
Shepherd, Glenn Close, Ellen Burstyn, Tyne Daly, Jill Eikenberry,
Morgan Fairchild and Susan Sarandon.
   Since the 1986 march, the number of endorsing organizations has
doubled to more than 400 and the number of college campuses has
also doubled.
   ``It's going to reshape the debate on abortion,'' Smeal said.
``Until now, everybody said the other side (anti-abortion) is a
minority but is stronger and has more political clout. You can't
say that any more. We're going to show a tremendous outpouring of
commitment and feeling.''
   Organizers hope they've been able to transmit the depth of that
feeling from an older to a younger generation, from the veterans of
the battle to legalize abortion to the young women who will have to
live with the outcome of the present debate.
   ``The women who went through illegal abortions are going to make
sure it doesn't happen to their daughters or granddaughters,'' Yard
said.

<HEAD>Some Governing Party Members Seek Resignation of Takeshita</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita faces pressure from
some members of his own party to resign to halt damage to the party
from a stock-profiteering scandal, politicians and news reports
said Thursday.
   Takeshita, who acknowledged receiving nearly $400,000 in
political contributions from the company at the center of the
scandal, has vowed to remain in power despite opposition calls for
his resignation and public opinion polls that show as few as 9
percent of Japanese support his government.
   The news reports said Thursday about 40 influential members of
the governing Liberal Democratic Party have decided to form the
faction, which demands all those linked to the scandal _ including
party leaders _ step down.
   ``The situation has reached a critical stage,'' they quoted
Shizuka Kamei, a leading member of the group, as saying. ``The
present Liberal Democratic Party is not capable of carrying out
self-purification.''
   The group also demands the government call former Prime Minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone for questioning by legislators on possible links
with the Recruit Co., an information conglomerate that allegedly
used stock bargains to seek favors.
   Opposition parties are boycotting parliamentary deliberations on
the budget, which began Saturday, to back their demands for
Nakasone's testimony.
   On Wednesday, a group of 41 junior party members formed a
faction to demand the government push political reforms.
   ``Prime Minister Takeshita and Mr. Nakasone should accept the
guilt and take appropriate measures to satisfy the people,'' said
faction leader Hajime Morita. ``Public distrust toward politics
cannot be easily erased.''
   Some Liberal Democrats have withdrawn from the party, saying
endorsement by the party, which has dominated Japanese politics for
most of the postwar era, now would hurt their chances to win
elections.
   ``Junior politicians ... can lose their political careers unless
the administration takes drastic measures immediately to restore
public support toward the LDP,'' said one governing party
politician Thursday. The member spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Takeshita and party Secretary-General Shintaro Abe have been
linked to the scandal, and another party leader, former Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, was one of three Cabinet ministers who
resigned because of links to Recruit.
   Takeshita, Abe and Miyazawa have denied personal wrongdoing.
   Prosecutors have arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen on
bribery and securities law violation charges.
   Recruit sold bargain-priced unlisted shares in a subsidiary to
about 150 influential people, who reaped large profits when public
trading in the stock began and it rose rapidly in value.
   Takeshita suffered another blow Wednesday with reports, which he
later confirmed, that Recruit contributed $382,000 to two Takeshita
fund-raising parties in May 1987, six months before he became prime
minister.
   His Liberal Democrats hold 297 of the 512 seats in parliament's
lower house, and 143 of the 252 in the upper house. Elections for
half of the upper house seats must be held this summer, and a
series of setbacks in local elections early this year has worried
upper house party candidates.
   A 3 percent sales tax that took effect Saturday, along with cuts
in income taxes and some other taxes, also has contributed to the
Takeshita government's unpopularity in the polls.

<HEAD>Consumer Debt Grows By $4.22 Billion in February</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans took out $4.22 billion more in
consumer debt than they paid off in February, the slowest pace of
growth in four months, the government said Thursday in a report
consistent with other signs the economy may be slowing.
   The Federal Reserve said the February increase in consumer
credit was down slightly from January's rise of $4.37 billion and
was the smallest monthly gain since a $3.91 billion increase in
October.
   Growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards
strengthened in February, while the gain in auto loans was slightly
smaller than in January. Borrowing through bank and credit union
loans not secured by real estate also slowed while mobile home
lending declined.
   Analysts said the restrained growth in debt indicates consumers
may be becoming more cautious about their buying plans and is in
line with other signs that the economy is slowing down in the
seventh year of its record peacetime expansion.
   ``It doesn't suggest any great retrenchment by consumers but it
does indicate somewhat more caution,'' said economist Cynthia Latta
of Data Resources Inc. in Lexington, Mass. ``It's consistent with
this gradually accumulating evidence that the economy is beginning
to cool off.''
   Consumer spending is closely watched as a barometer of economic
health because it accounts for two-thirds of economic activity.
Most government reports on the economy's performance in February
pointed downward, although 1989 began with strong momentum.
   Analysts expect the economy to slow this year as the recovery
ages and the nation responds to a yearlong campaign by the Federal
Reserve Board to push up interest rates to restrain growth and keep
inflation in check.
   February's 7.5 percent rise in the seasonally adjusted annual
rate of credit growth was down from 7.9 percent in January and 7.8
percent in December. For all of 1988, consumer debt rose 8.75
percent.
   Auto loans rose $2.1 billion in February, an 8.6 percent annual
rate of growth, following a $2.13 billion increase during January.
   Automobile sales have been weak this year, with business held
down by rising interest rates. Automakers in recent weeks have
launched a new round of cash rebates and low-interest financing
programs in an effort to boost sales and avoid large production
cutbacks.
   Growth in the category of debt that includes credit cards rose
$1.6 billion in February, a 10.3 percent annual rate of growth.
That followed a January increase of $1.02 billion, a 6.6 percent
annual rate.
   Mobile home debts dropped $59 million in February, a 2.8 percent
rate of decline, after rising $50 million in January.
   Bank and credit union loans not secured by real estate rose by
$569 million in February, a 4.1 percent rate of growth, after
rising $1.17 billion in January.
   The various changes left total consumer debt at a seasonally
adjusted $674.78 billion in February, up 8.1 percent from a year
earlier.

   Criticism of a lavish lifestyle by
evangelists Oral and Richard Roberts has prompted the sale of their
two California vacation homes, valued at more than $1 million,
Richard Roberts says.
   Roberts said the criticism has resurfaced since his father asked
followers to sell unneeded valuables to help raise $11 million by
May 6 to keep his 41-year-old ministry afloat.
   Richard Roberts said he and his father sold their homes in
Rancho Mirage, Calif., in the past year.
   ``There was a perception that just having the house was bad,''
the younger Roberts said. ``I didn't want to do anything that would
reflect negatively on the ministry.''
   Their homes in Tulsa, both owned by Oral Roberts University,
also are valued at a total of about $1 million, according to Tulsa
County tax records.

   The Sun newspaper reported Thursday that it had
handed over to police four stolen letters belonging to Princess
Anne which had been sent anonymously to the paper.
   The racy tabloid, Britain's biggest selling paper with a
national daily circulation of 4.2 million, said the handwritten
letters had been hand-delivered to the 38-year-old daughter of
Queen Elizabeth II without going through the Post Office.
   The paper, which specializes in stories on the royals, said all
four letters were signed by the same person and had been ``spirited
out'' of the Princess's private quarters at Buckingham Palace.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman who in accordance with British
practice declined to be identified confirmed that police had
received four letters from The Sun. ``We are making inquiries about
them. We are not prepared to discuss their origin, destination or
contents,'' he said.

   The nation is moving away from the
self-interest that marked 1980s as the ``me decade,'' as Americans
again turn toward public purpose over private interest, historian
Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. says.
   Schlesinger, an assistant to President John F. Kennedy, said
Wednesday in a speech at Miami University that a growing sense of
selflessness fits into a historical rhythm.
   Schlesinger said the 1980s will go down as an era of vulgar
consumption, towering debt, leveraged buyouts and widespread
crookedness in both the private and public sectors, but he
predicted a sharp change in the national mood around 1990.
   ``Already there seems to be the start of revulsion against greed
and the start of a revival of idealism on college campuses, of
community service and a revived concern for social justice,'' he
said.

   A federal judge says there have been too many
delays in the tax evasion trial of billionaires Harry and Leona
Helmsley and jury selection will begin June 26.
   Helmsley, 79, and his 67-year-old wife were indicted last April
on charges that they evaded taxes by disguising about $4 million in
renovations to their Greenwich, Conn., mansion as business expenses.
   The couple head a $5 billion hotel and real estate empire.
   ``This case has taken too long, in my judgment, to get to
trial,'' U.S. District Judge John Walker said Wednesday in setting
the new trial.
   The Helmsleys' trial originally was scheduled to start last
September, but was pushed back until January and delayed again
until May after defense lawyers filed numerous motions to overturn
the indictment or remove one or both of the Helmsleys from the case.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha, South
Africa's strong-willed leader since 1978, on Thursday announced his
intention to retire after elections to be held by September.
   His party had made clear it wanted a new president.
   Botha, whose grip on power began to loosen after a stroke in
January, told Parliament that an early general election will be
held on an unspecified date within the next five months.
   Botha, 73, did not state explicitly that he would retire, but he
said the outgoing president would hand over the official seal to a
new president following the elections.
   The new president is expected to be Education Minister F.W. de
Klerk, who succeeded Botha as leader of the National Party on Feb.
2. Many Nationalists view de Klerk as more flexible than Botha and
more capable of breaking the country's black-white political
stalemate.
   The state-controlled South African Broadcasting Corp., in a
commentary to be broadcast Friday, said Botha ``made it clear he
did not intend to stand for another term.''
   Botha ``now enters the last months of a political career that
has spanned more than a half-century,'' the commentary said.
   He has presided over the country's worst racial unrest and
deepest international isolation but also its most ambitious race
reforms and foreign policy initiatives, including plans for the
independence of Namibia.
   Botha said he would dissolve Parliament in May and then set a
date for the election. The voting is expected to take place between
July 24 and Sept. 6
   After the election, an electoral college dominated by the
majority party in the white chamber of South Africa's racially
separate Parliament _ virtually certain to be Botha's National
Party _ will choose the new president.
   There would then be a ceremony ``where the seal of the republic
would be handed over to him by the outgoing state president,''
Botha told a joint session of Parliament in Cape Town.
   De Klerk grinned as he emerged from Parliament but told
reporters: ``I have no statement to make.''
   Botha returned to work in March after spending eight weeks
recuperating from his stroke while his official duties were carried
out by an acting president, Constitutional Development Minister
Chris Heunis.
   During Botha's convalescence, National Party newspapers and
politicians began suggesting that the president make way for a new
generation of leaders. Botha declared he planned to stay in office
until 1990, and the party's parliamentary caucus then adopted a
resolution saying it wanted de Klerk to be president.
   The party lacked the constitutional power to force the president
from office. Botha's term expires on Sept. 4, but he legally could
have served until March 1990, the deadline for the next election.
   De Klerk, 53, said after becoming party leader that he sought a
South Africa ``free of domination and oppression.'' However, he
also reaffirmed the party's commitment to segregated schools and
neighborhoods for whites who want them.
   Botha, the son of a farmer, left the university to become a
National Party organizer in 1936.
   He entered Parliament in 1948, the year the National Party came
to power and began codifying apartheid legislation, and joined the
Cabinet in 1961.
   He became head of the white-minority government in 1978 as prime
minister. For several years he enjoyed a mandate among whites to
maintain stability while moving away from rigid racial segregation.
   In 1984, Botha helped push through a new constitution that
brought Asians and mixed-race people into the previously all-white
parliament. But the black majority continued to have no vote in
national affairs.
   Black anger ignited two years of political violence in which an
estimated 2,500 people died.
   The constitution abolished the post of prime minister, and Botha
became president.
   He was the first government leader to call for race reform and
was credited with repealing apartheid laws that banned interracial
marriages and required blacks to have a permit to be in whites-only
areas. His reforms triggered a defection from the National Party by
right-wing whites who opposed any concessions to blacks.
   But Botha refused to consider the possibility of black-majority
government and insisted that whites retain segregated schools and
neighborhoods.

<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Alfredo
Cristiani of El Salvador says he represents rightists who think of
themselves as modern conservatives, not exponents of their party's
early neo-fascism.
   As Cristiani meets President Bush on Friday, many question
whether his faction of the Republican Nationalist Alliance is
dominant and whether he can control reputedly sinister elements of
the party. Cristiani takes office June 1.
   The United States, which gives El Salvador about $1.5 million a
day in aid, has said it will keep a close watch on human rights
abuses under the right-wing party, known as Arena. Officials also
have tied continued aid to an improved record.
   Even his antagonists consider Cristiani personally upstanding,
and most accept his avowed commitment to furthering democracy in a
nation ravaged by nine years of civil war.
   He was faced with an important test March 31.
   An outgoing Criminal Court judge ruled that two military men and
a landowner implicated in an kidnap-for-profit ring in the early
1980s were illegally detained and must be freed.
   All three, along with five fugitives absolved by the judge, were
cronies of Roberto d'Aubuisson, a dismissed major of army
intelligence who founded Arena in 1981 and retains great influence
in it.
   Cristiani acted decisively. He brought pressure to bear on the
judiciary, got the judge's order revoked and kept two of the three
suspects in jail.
   New arrest warrants were issued for the man released and for the
five d'Aubuisson associates implicated in the ring.
   A ranking U.S. Embassy official said of Cristiani's first human
rights test: ``He passed with flying colors.''
   Critics of Arena say Cristiani, a wealthy landowner educated at
Georgetown University in Washington, is a pseudo-democratic veneer
on an apparatus linked to rightist death squads that killed tens of
thousands of alleged leftists in the early 1980s.
   Arena's anthem, broadcast incessantly during the campaign, still
says: ``El Salvador will be the tomb where the Reds will all end
up.''
   The president-elect denies being a front man and says
d'Aubuisson, who is an Arena legislator and leads the majority bloc
in the unicameral legislature, will not have a post in the
executive branch.
   ``There should be no doubt that it is I who will run the
government,'' Cristiani said after winning the March 19 election.
He is 41, a coffee-grower, businessman and champion athlete who
came late to politics and rose to prominence in Arena after
d'Aubuisson lost the 1984 presidential election.
   ``Be assured that I entered politics only because of the
country's grave crisis and am not motivated by personal ambition,''
he said in a radio advertisement during his campaign.
   Cristiani campaigned on a platform of ``capitalism for the
masses'' and an end to the civil war.
   He has said he is willing to talk with leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, but ``we will not
negotiate our political platform, or a share of power. We will not
negotiate democracy.''
   Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez, auxiliary archbishop of San
Salvador, said recently the Arena victory was likely ``to augment
the level of violence, because they are advocates of escalation of
the war.''
   The new president's position is that he will offer the rebels
terms for laying down arms and entering the democratic process, and
will increase military pressure if they refuse.
   Rebel leaders say that amounts to a call for surrender. They say
they will be the ones to intensify the war, showing the country to
be ungovernable without their participation.

<HEAD>New Strides in Detecting Genetic Disorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY SEDOR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors have discovered how to identify genetic
defects in embryos as young as two days old, greatly reducing the
need for aborting a abnormal fetus in later stages of pregnancy,
researchers said Thursday.
   ``It is a wonderful move forward ... a scientific advance, a
medical advance and an ethical advance,'' biologist Robert Edwards
told doctors from 42 nations at a conference on the test tube
fertilization techniques.
   The new work by British and American scientists has developed
screening techniques for sex-linked handicaps such as muscular
dystrophy as well as some immunodeficiency and neurological
disorders.
   It has preciptated the opening later this year of the first
genetic screening programs using ``in vitro'' fertilization.
   They will be at Britain's Bourne Hallan Clinic in Cambridge and
Hammersmith Hospital in London, said Edwards, a member of the
British team responsible for the world's first test tube baby in
1978.
   The traditional screening method, amniocentesis, can be
performed only in the second trimester of pregnancy. It involves
removing a small amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus in
the uterus.
   If a genetic disorder is found, the woman faces the often
traumatic choice of abortion in the fifth or sixth month of
pregnancy.
   ``Some women never get over a lost baby, especially when an
abortion is performed after amniocentesis, when she has already
felt it move and is heavily pregnant,'' said Dr. Robert M. Winston
of Hammersmith Hospital.
   The new method allows doctors to study the genetic makeup of a
2-day-old embryo produced in a test tube.
   By removing a single cell of the embryo, then amplifying and
copying specific gene sequences, scientists can identify defects.
If the embryo is normal, it is implanted in the woman's uterus 24
hours later.
   ``Now you're seeing the breakthrough ... you've got the embryo
right before you put it in. So they will know their pregnancy is
right. That for me is marvelous,'' said Roberts.
   Among drawbacks is the low success rate of only one in five for
test tube fertilizations.
   Roberts also cautioned the new method would not immediately
eliminate the need for amniocentesis.
   ``In the early days of the work, we'd have to do amniocentesis
to find out what our failure rate is,'' Edwards explained. ``We
take an embryo and type it ... Then you type it with amniocentesis
and say, yes it's a male and it's free of disease.''
   But he added: ``Even if you're only 95 percent right, you reduce
the amniocentesis abortions to just 5 percent of what we've got
now.''
   Among disorders the new technique can detect are absence of
enzymes which lead to muscular dystrophy and a highly debilitating
disease known as Lesch Nyhan, both of which affect males. Children
with Lesch Nyhan are crippled and have to be restrained phsyically
to prevent them mutilating themselves.
   A woman who carries a dominant gene for such inherited disorders
has a 50 percent chance of passing on the defect, while a woman
with a recessive gene has one in four chances of passing it on.
   Winston cited one woman who produced a child with Lesch Nyhan,
then had five late-term abortions when amniocentesis detected the
disorder.
   He said another woman's first marriage ended after two abortions
of fetuses suffering muscular dystrophy. The woman since has
aborted three more such fetuses.

<TEXT>
   The Senate, told it ``is a guardian of
tradition without becoming a barrier to change,'' celebrated its
first two centuries of history on Thursday, recalling its faltering
beginnings and noting its many milestones.
   April 6, 1789, was the date that the first Senate, meeting in
New York City, finally reached a quorum _ and thus was able to
start conducting business _ after a frustrating month of failing to
do so.
   ``History oozes from these walls,'' said Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, as the day of commemoration began in the Old Senate Chamber
in the Capitol with the issuing of a postage stamp displaying the
gilt shield and eagle still suspended over the presiding officer's
chair.
   The eagle and shield were there during speeches on the old
chamber's floor which served the Senate from 1810 to 1859, and can
be seen in 19th century prints involving three famous senators of
the era: Daniel Webster of Massachusetts, Henry Clay of Kentucky
and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina.
   Those three senators and the roles they played in the period
before the Civil War were invoked repeatedly as past and former
senators hailed the Senate as an institution.
   Howard H. Baker Jr. of Tennessee, a former Senate Republican
leader, said the sense of history in the old Senate hall, and in
the Senate's present chamber first occupied in 1859, is so strong
that at times one can truly ``smell the marble.''
   Nearly 20 former senators _ including Baker and former
Democratic leader Mike Mansfield of Montana _ joined senators in
the current 101st Congress for the ceremonies. Members of the House
of Representatives celebrated the quorum bicentennial session of
that body on Tuesday.
   Former Sen. Thomas F. Eagleton, a Democrat from Missouri, said
that the legacy of the early Senate is the art of the American
political compromise.
   ``Today compromise is woven into constitutional fabric of the
nation,'' Eagleton said.
   Although many senators past and present have regarded compromise
as morally wrong, Eagleton said it is politically essential.
   ``Compromise, in my judgment, is getting a bad rap,'' Eagleton
said. ``Without it we screech to a halt, paralyzed by
intransigence.''
   The Senate session began at 11 a.m., the hour of the first
session two centuries ago.
   With the conclusion of the ceremony's first half in the old
chamber, senators formed a procession to the Senate's present
meeting place down the hall.
   Senior senators from the states answered the roll call,
beginning with Delaware, which became the first state in 1787, and
continuing to Hawaii, which in 1959 became the 50th to join the
union.
   When South Carolina's name was called, Republican Strom Thurmond
gave this response: ``South Carolina was not the first state to be
admitted, but it was the first to secede'' in 1860. After the Civil
War, South Carolina returned to the union in 1868.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, noted Thomas Jefferson's description
of the Senate as a stage, and recalled some of the drama the
present chamber has witnessed, including the one-vote defeat of the
attempt to oust President Andrew Johnson during Reconstruction
after the Civil War, and the rejection of President Woodrow
Wilson's effort to bring the United States into the League of
Nations after World War I.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said that while
the Senate has undergone many changes over the years, it remains a
place where the rights of the minority are protected and speech can
remain virtually unlimited.
   ``It is a guardian of tradition without becoming a barrier to
change,'' he said.
   Senators moved in and out of the ceremonies to spirited John
Philip Sousa marches played by the Marine Corps band.
   A tourist asked a doorman: ``Does a band play every day the
Senate meets?''
   ``No,'' the doorman replied. ``Only once every 200 years.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev conducted overt
intelligence at a high-tech factory Thursday, asking surprised
workers not only about quality control but also whether they were
happy and how much money they made.
   ``He even asked me my salary, which was a bit embarrassing
because I think us English like to keep our salaries to
ourselves,'' said Michael Smith, a 43-year-old worker at the Case
Communications Ltd. plant 18 miles northwest of London.
   Although the British are often reserved, especially on the
subject of money, Smith presumably divulged the details. The
plant's workers make an average of about $37,000 a year.
   On the only full day of his 40-hour visit to Britain, the Soviet
president paid a 40-minute visit to the 1,000-worker plant,
arriving in an impressive 22-car motorcade.
   The highly automated factory designs and makes ``network
systems'' that enable computers to talk to each other. The company
said the Soviets invited themselves last week because Gorbachev
would be interested in its technology and relaxed corporate culture.
   Gorbachev was greeted outside at the company's main building by
British Trade Secretary Lord Young and company and local officials.
Case Communications flew the Soviet flag for the occasion.
   Nearly 200 people braved cold drizzle and waited behind a police
barricade across the street hoping to catch a glimpse of the Soviet
leader.
   ``Keep up the good work,'' read one placard.
   Young said after the visit: ``He was very interested in ways in
which we are dealing with quality control. He showed an enormous
curiosity and I think he will have found the visit extremely
useful.''
   Gorbachev talked to Smith, a senior designer of printed circuit
boards, with particular friendliness, and commented on their shared
name.
   ``Michael, I know that name,'' Gorbachev said.
   ``He was a very friendly chap, I thought,'' Smith said later.
   ``He was more interested in my private life. He asked where I
was educated, what sort of school I went to, where I lived, what
size of house I had. He wanted to talk about my family, my wife and
children, where they went to school.''
   Employee Angela Dawkins, 42, told Gorbachev she had worked at
the factory ``for six happy years.''
   Gorbachev fixed her with a stare and said: ``Are you saying this
because the bosses are listening?''
   ``No, I really mean it,'' she said.
   ``Ah yes, I can see from your eyes,'' she said Gorbachev replied.

   Oliver North, testifying in his own defense,
said today Reagan administration superiors told him ``not to tell
anybody'' about his role in funneling aid to the Contra rebels in
Nicaragua.
   North took the stand shortly after George Bush was identified in
court as an intermediary in President Reagan's secret plan to aid
the Contras.
   North, who faces a dozen charges in connection with his role in
the Iran-Contra affair, said, ``I was particularly admonished'' to
keep secret ``that another country was providing millions of
dollars to help the Contras.'' Saudi Arabia supplied some $32
million in aid to the Contras, beginning in mid-1984.
   Asked by defense lawyer Brendan Sullivan who told him he was
going to be running the operation, North identified then-national
security adviser Robert McFarlane, his deputy John Poindexter, and
CIA Director William Casey.
   Under questioning from his lawyer, the former White House aide
depicted himself as a Marine officer with plans to take command of
a battalion at Camp LeJeune when top officials in the Reagan
administration enlisted him to run the secret Contra operation in
1984.
   North testified in his own defense after his attorneys read into
the record a lengthy account of the Reagan administration's efforts
to keep alive the Contra struggle against the leftist government of
Nicaragua.
   The account, a legal ``admission of fact'' read to the jury with
the agreement of the prosecution, said Bush personally told the
president of Honduras in 1985 that extra aid was being funneled to
his country as payment for helping the Contras.
   The account also said a representative of Panamanian military
leader Manuel Noriega offered in a meeting with North to
assassinate the Sandinista leadership in Nicaragua. North was said
to reply that the United States wanted no part of any such plans.
   Deputy White House press secretary Stephen Hart said, ``I have
no comment'' on the developments, adding that ``this is part of an
ongoing trial.''
   A short while after the ``admission of fact'' statement was
read, North was on the stand and fielding questions from his own
attorney.
   ``Was there a time when you were stepping in'' to help the
Contras, asked North lawyer Brendan Sullivan.
   ``I was not stepping in, I was brought in,'' responded North.
   ``I was told not to tell anybody'' about his role in taking over
from the CIA in overseeing the Contras' needs, North testified.
   Prosecutor John Keker objected when Sullivan asked whether North
``understood'' that President Reagan had designated him as the
Contras' new provider. U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
sustained the objection and North didn't answer.
   North said he ended up handling ``everything that had been
coming from the CIA.''
   ``Everything that they had, from the little tents that they
lived in ... to food, to bullets, to intelligence'' had come from
the CIA, said North.
   ``I don't recall there was any specific break point'' when all
the Contras' needs fell on his shoulders, but he was carrying the
load by the time the cutoff in military aid went in effect in
October 1984, North testified.
   North recalled how he went to Casey to get bank account numbers
so he would know where money to the Contras was to be funneled and
which factions of the splintered Contra movement to contact.
   Dressed in a dark suit, North sat down in the witness box seven
weeks after a jury began hearing testimony in the case.
   ``So you're Colonel North,'' his attorney, Brendan Sullivan,
began as the former White House aide took the stand. ``Yes sir, I
am,'' he replied with a smile.
   It was disclosed earlier in North's trial that President Reagan
personally approved a secret deal early in 1985 to funnel $110
million in extra aid to Honduras in exchange for that country's
support for the Contras.
   The deal with Honduras was one of the quid pro quo arrangements
whose details have emerged at North's trial showing how the United
States secretly enlisted the aid of other countries in support of
the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when Congress had cut off military
aid to the Contras.
   After Reagan approved the assistance, Bush, then vice president,
told Honduran President Roberto Suazo ``that President Reagan had
directed expedited delivery of U.S. military items to Honduras,''
said the statement read by North's lawyer.
   ``Vice President Bush also informed Suazo that President Reagan
had directed that currently withheld economic assistance for
Honduras should be released,'' said the statement.
   Bush also said ``that the United States would provide from its
own military stocks critical security assistance items that had
been ordered by Honduran armed forces; and that several security
programs under way for Honduran security forces would be
enhanced,'' the statement said.
   Noriega's representative offered the assassinations in mid-1986
on behalf of the Panamanian leader ``in exchange for a promise''
from the U.S. government ``to help clean up Noriega's image,''
according to the statement.
   Also to be part of the deal, according to the statement, was the
lifting of a ban by the U.S. government on military sales to the
Panamian defense forces.
   After lengthy criminal investigations, Noriega was indicted in
the United States on Feb. 4, 1988, for alleged involvement in
international drug trafficking.
   North told the representative at the meeting that ``the U.S.
government could not be involved in assassinations,'' said the
statement read by his lawyer.
   The Panamanian representative pointed out that Noriega had
helped the United States the previous year ``in blowing up a
Sandinista arsenal,'' the statement said.
   When North told his boss, Poindexter, of the Panamanian offer,
Poindexter responded, according to the statement, that the U.S.
government ``could not be involved in assassination, but Panamanian
assistance with sabatoge would be another story.'' Poindexter
recommended that North speak with Noriega directly, it said.
   The prosecution said in a motion earlier that North should be
compelled to produce his notebooks and ledgers if he testified.
   North chronicled his daily activities at the National Security
Council in a series of notebooks. He also kept a ledger of the use
of travelers checks he received from Contra leader Adolfo Calero.
North told Congress he destroyed the ledger but the prosecutors
have been under orders not to read his immunized testimony.
   The government had issued a subpoena to produce the documents
March 3, contingent on his testifying.
   Other information detailed in the statement read by North's
lawyer included:
   _Reagan ``urged'' the Saudi head of state in 1985 that the Saudi
Arabian government ``continue its support'' for the Contras.
Subsequently, the Saudis gave $25 million.
   _In 1983, CIA Director William Casey became involved in a secret
effort known as Operation Tipped Kettle to persuade Israel to make
available weapons captured from the PLO. Casey discussed the matter
with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
   _The CIA advised that it would use the weapons for various
purposes. Several hundred tons of the weapons were shipped to the
Contras as congressionally appropriated funds to the rebels ran out.
   _In 1984, under an operation known as Elephant Herd, the United
States was to tell Israel it would be as flexible as posible within
the constraints of the law ``to compensate'' Israel with aid in
exchange for the weapons it had gotten from the PLO.
   Earlier today, former hostage David Jacobsen testified that
North's eyes filled with tears following Jacobsen's release because
other Americans held captive in Lebanon had not been released.
   Jacobsen said that on a plane flight to Germany North told
Jacobsen he was ``discouraged'' because the other hostages hadn't
been released and ``they can't enjoy the same'' happiness ``you are
enjoying.''

   The fired captain of the Exxon Valdez
walked out of jail Thursday after winning reduction of the $1
million bond set by a judge who compared the tanker's oil spill to
the Hiroshima bombing.
   A stone-faced Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, 42, walked past reporters
without comment and climbed into a waiting Jaguar with his lawyers.
   A few hours earlier, a supervising state judge reduced his bail
to $25,000 and called the $1 million figure ``unconstitutionally
excessive.''
   Hazelwood, who was charged with being intoxicated when his
tanker crashed into a reef on March 24, spent one night in jail.
   He turned himself in Wednesday, and state Supreme Court Justice
Kenneth Rohl set bail at $1 million bond or $500,000 cash.
   ``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been
equaled, at least in this country,'' said Rohl, who comes from a
family of professional seamen. ``We have a man-made destruction
that has not been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.''
   Justice Thomas Stark, who heard the bond appeal, said there was
little chance of Hazelwood jumping bail and drastically cut it to
the amount originally requested by prosecutors.
   ``The amount of bail is not commensurate with the seriousness of
the crime or the affect of the crime on the community,'' said Stark
after listening to an emotional appeal from Hazelwood attorney
Thomas Russo.
   Hazelwood has 30 days to prepare for an extradition hearing that
would return him to Alaska, where he faces charges of operating a
ship while intoxicated, reckless endangerment, and negligent
discharge of oil. The charges carry a combined maximum penalty of
2\ years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Hazelwood was fired by Exxon last Thursday after the National
Transportation Safety Board said tests taken about nine hours after
the March 24 disaster showed he was under the influence of alcohol.

<TEXT>
   A threatened lawsuit by the American
Civil Liberties Union has brought a halt to a years-old practice of
reading Bible verses each day over the intercom at Blytheville High
School.
   ``We sought legal advice and learned that we would probably not
be on solid legal ground and would probably lose the case,''
Superintendent Frank Ladd said Wednesday.
   Principal Bruce Young had earlier contended the readings,
carried out for at least 17 years, didn't violate the
constitutional separation of church and state. He said students
could ``tune them out'' if they wanted and that no attempt was made
to impose specific interpretations of the verses.
   Jay Jacobson, director of the Arkansas chapter of the ACLU, had
said that group was discussing a lawsuit with a potential client in
the district.
   ``I'm delighted to see that they voluntarily agreed with the
Bill of Rights and will set a fine example for young people that
laws are meant to be obeyed,'' he said.

   The State Department confirmed Thursday that
it has revoked a visa of former Paraguayan leader Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner.
   The Paraguayan strongman, who had ruled his country for 34
years, was ousted in a coup. He arrived in Brazil on Feb. 5 after
being granted political asylum there.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters only
that Stroessner's visa ``has been revoked.''
   But a department official, who spoke on condition he not be
identified by name, said Stroessner had applied for a visa on
humanitarian and medical grounds several weeks ago, but the request
was denied.
   ``We replied that there are excellent doctors in Brazil,'' the
official said.
   Several members of Stroessner's family, including his wife, have
been given visas and are living in Miami, the official said.
   They were not involved in Paraguayan politics and therefore were
allowed to enter the country, the official said.

<HEAD>Sihanouk Urges Conference on Cambodia, China Vows To Keep Arming
Guerrillas</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A resistance leader on Thursday
called for an international conference on Cambodia, and China vowed
to arm the guerrillas until Vietnam fulfills its pledge to end its
10-year military intervention.
   Resistance leaders expressed skepticism over Vietnam's promise
Wednesday to withdraw its estimated 50,000 to 70,000 soldiers from
Cambodia by Sept. 30.
   Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia has been a major stumbling
block to establishing relations with the United States and
improving economic ties with non-communist Southeast Asian nations.
   China has also refused to resume normal relations with the
Soviet Union as long as Vietnamese troops remain. Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev is to visit China next month for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   On Thursday, Vietnam's official Hanoi Radio reaffirmed the Sept.
30 deadline and urged the international community to prevent the
brutal Khmer Rouge regime from regaining power.
   In December 1978, Vietnam ousted the communist Khmer Rouge,
under whose rule an estimated one-fourth of Cambodia's 8 million
people died from famine and execution since 1975.
   Fears that the Khmer Rouge, the strongest of three insurgent
groups in Prince Norodom Sihanouk's resistance coalition, would
regain power has been a major stumbling block to a negotiated
settlement.
   In a written statement from Beijing, Sihanouk, the former
Cambodian ruler, rejected ``all decisions, all conditions, and all
accords'' announced by Vietnam regarding Cambodia.
   Sihanouk urged French President Francois Mitterrand to convene a
conference including the five permanent U.N. Security Council
members _ China, the Soviet Union, the United States, France and
Britain _ as well as Vietnam, all Cambodian factions and the six
members of the non-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
   He urged Vietnam to pull out of Cambodia as soon as possible
under supervision of the United Nations, which would also supervise
new elections.
   In a separate statement, China, the main supplier to the
insurgents, said it was ``entirely just'' to keep aiding them until
Vietnam makes good on its promise to withdraw.
   Sihanouk's clandestine Voice of the Khmer Radio said the prince
doubted the Vietnamese would carry out the withdrawal. The
broadcast, monitored Thursday in Bangkok, Thailand, also said
Sihanouk rejected Vietnam's proposal that India, Poland and Canada
be invited to witness the pullout.
   Indonesia meanwhile said it would sponsor a meeting between
Sihanouk and Cambodia's Vietnam-backed prime minister, Hun Sen,
next month. A spokeswoman for Sihanouk said he planned to meet with
Hun Sen on May 2 in Jakarta.
   In Wednesday's statement, the governments of Cambodia, Laos and
Vietnam recommended revival of an ``international controls and
supervision commission'' established by the 1954 Geneva Agreement
on Indochina.
   But China said the international monitoring force ``should be
established under the auspices of the U.N. secretary-general
following his consultations and agreement with the countries
concerned.''
   Son Sann, leader of the Khmer Peoples National Liberation Front,
said Vietnam must notify the U.N. secretary-general of its plans,
allow the U.N. Security Council to organize an international
peace-keeping force and ``abstain from diverting the real nature of
an aggression war into a civil war.''
   The front is a non-communist member of the Sihanouk coalition.
   In Paris, Suon Kaset, a spokeswoman for Son Sann's group,
claimed 20,000 Vietnamese troops already had been integrated into
Hun Sen's forces and would not be withdrawn.
   ``This is their so-called withdrawal,'' she said. ``It's a
farce.''

<TEXT>
   The state's wildlife director was fired a
week after New Mexico officials charged him in an antelope trapping
incident.
   Charles Allen, who held the post for two years, was dismissed
Wednesday by Charles Travis, executive director of the Texas Parks
and Wildlife Department.
   Several news stories have disclosed that Parks and Wildlife
employees stocked fish and game on private lands belonging to
politically powerful Texans, including state House Speaker Gib
Lewis.
   Lewis, an avid hunter, said Thursday that the controversy
surrounding the department since February was unwarranted.
   ``I do have some friends around the country, and I called them
to find out. The only reason that there was any cases brought (is)
because of the press play that this has received back in Austin,
Texas,'' Lewis said.
   The speaker maintains the animals in question remain public
property and that anyone could take part in the stocking programs.
He said the firing of Allen threatens destruction of ``one of the
best parks and wildlife departments in the country.''
   Travis was unavailable for comment Thursday, his secretary said,
and he didn't immediately to return a call from The Associated
Press.
   In a brief statement, he gave no reason for the firing. He also
said that after reviewing a continuing internal investigation, ``It
is my opinion that Mr. Allen did not knowingly violate any criminal
statute.''
   Allen, 40, also could not be reached Thursday; there was no
answer at his home phone. He has declared his innocence of three
felony and six misdemeanor charges brought against him last week in
Alamagordo, N.M.
   Allen served as net gunner in a helicopter mission Jan. 30 to
trap 40 antelope. Authorities charge the helicopter strayed over
New Mexico and that Allen took three antelope illegally.

   Moslem guerrillas attacked Kabul and
three other cities with rockets and missiles Thursday, the Foreign
Ministry said, despite a cease-fire called by the government to
mark the holy month of Ramadan.
   It was the fifth time since January 1987 that President Najib
has called a halt to hostilities. None has succeeded.
   A truck driver who said he was part of a convoy hauling fuel
said guerrillas tried to hijack some of the trucks about six miles
from Kabul on the Salang Highway.
   The hijackers got about a mile before being attacked by two
government helicopters, said the driver, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In the afternoon, a missile blew up a fuel truck parked near a
petroleum tank depot on the northern edge of the capital. Several
trucks parked nearby also exploded.
   There was no word on casualties from that attack or from
reported bombardments in Jalalabad, Kandahar, and Sarobi.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said government
troops withheld their fire in those three areas, despite rocket and
cannon fire from guerrillas. The report could not be confirmed.
   The military command announced the cease-fire in a nationwide
radio broadcast Wednesday night for Ramadan, the Islamic holy month.
   Najib, in an interview with the BBC, said his troops would
retaliate with renewed force if the guerrillas broke the cease-fire.
   Amani said guerrillas fired 32 rockets and cannon rounds at the
southern city of Kandahar, where they have been besieging
government forces for the past year.
   Amani said fewer than 100 rounds were fired at Jalalabad. In the
past two weeks, the government has accused the guerrillas of firing
as many as 12,000 rounds a day at the city 75 miles east of Kabul.
   The spokesman said he had no indication how many rounds were
fired at Sarobi, on the highway midway between Kabul and Jalalabad.
   Amani said only three of the seven Pakistan-based guerrilla
factions were firing at Jalalabad, Sarobi and Kandahar.
   He identified them as the factions led by Yunus Khalis,
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Rasul Sayyaf _ the most hard-line
fundamentalists of guerrillas who have been trying for more than a
decade to oust Najib's Soviet-backed government.
   The Soviet Union sent troops into Afghanistan in December 1979
but withdrew the last of them in February under a U.N.-mediated
accord.
   In Moscow, a Foreign Ministry official said reports the United
States had named an envoy to Afghan rebels showed that U.S.
officials planned to break relations with Afghanistan and recognize
a rebel government-in-exile.
   Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh told a news briefing the
United States and Pakistan continued to violate the agreement that
led to the withdrawal of Soviet troops and were intentionally
aggravating the situation in Afghanistan.
   Reports published in the United States on Thursday said Peter
Tomsen, deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, was appointed
to represent U.S. interests to the rebel movement.
   ``The United States does not want to extinguish the flames in
Afghanistan. They make every effort to topple the government in
Afghanistan. They want to bring pressure to bear on the situation
in Afghanistan,'' Gremitskikh said.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National police reported their first
confrontations with death squads and said Thursday they found
documents showing the paramilitary groups are run by drug
traffickers.
   Statements from two police generals said officers killed 10
gunmen and seized 8,800 pounds of cocaine and cocaine paste in two
encounters.
   In another development, the Defense Ministry said it would
permit the U.S. government to install radar in Colombia to track
drug-running aircraft.
   Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez said documents found Tuesday in a raid
on a traffickers' hideout in Bogota established that Israeli and
British mercenaries had been training drug traffickers in use of
weapons. He said one gunman was killed 10 were arrested in the raid.
   Witnesses identified three of those arrested as participants in
the assassination Feb. 27 of Teofilo Forero, secretary-general of
the Patriotic Union party, the general said.
   About 700 members of the leftist Patriotic Union have been
killed since it was formed four years ago. Until this week, no one
connected with the government had indicated there were any clues to
who was behind the killings.
   The same group is suspected in an attack at the Bogota airport
March 3 in which four men firing submachine guns killed Jose
Antequera, a member of the Patriotic Union executive committee,
Maza said. A bodyguard also was killed and eight people were
wounded.
   Documents seized in the Bogota raid showed the death squad to be
run by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, who the U.S. Justice Department
says is among Colombia's main drug traffickers, the general said.
   A statement by Gen. Octavio Vargas said the other encounter with
a death squad, also on Tuesday, occurred near San Luis village 120
miles north of Bogota.
   Anti-narcotics police were fired upon as they approached a
cocaine laboratory in the jungle and returned the fire, killing
nine drug traffickers and capturing three, he said. Vargas said
four officers were wounded.
   Police found 6,600 pounds of cocaine ready to be shipped and
2,200 pounds of paste, the general said.
   He said documents found at the drug lab connected the men with a
death squad run by Pablo Escobar Gaviria. U.S. authorities say he
runs the Medellin Cartel, which smuggles 80 percent of Colombia's
cocaine into the United States.
   Last year, Fortune magazine described Escobar Gaviria as a
billionaire and among the world's 20 richest men. Fifteen years
ago, he was a pickpocket and car thief in Medellin.
   The radar agreement signed by the Colombian military and U.S.
government was disclosed in a Defense Ministry news release.
   One radar unit will be on San Andres, an island about 500 miles
north of the Caribbean coast, and the other in the Amazon jungle of
southern Colombia, it said. The ministry said the Colombian air
force would operate the radars.
   Although the San Andres radar would be only about 125 miles off
Nicaragua, the ministry said it would not be used to monitor
Nicaraguan air traffic. U.S. officials have said Colombian cocaine
has been flown to Nicaragua en route to the United States.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Beef Industry Responding to Consumer Demands for Less
Fat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers prefer less fat in their steaks and
hamburger, and the beef industry has responded well to those
demands, two Texas A&amp;M University scientists said Thursday.
   H. Russell Cross and Jeff Savell said further progress can be
expected in the future as attention continues to be drawn to health
issues, notably the dietary linkage between fats and high levels of
blood cholesterol.
   But Savell told a conference sponsored by the National
Cattlemen's Association that if he had to send cattle producers and
the beef industry a note from the teacher, it might say:
``Excellent progress made in making product fit consumers' needs.
Keep working on leanness, convenience and cost, value. Remember to
maintain taste, or consumers will go elsewhere.''
   The beef industry drew praise from Jay Fletcher of the Community
Nutrition Institute, who agreed that less fat is being sold to
consumers.
   ``I think they have done more than many other industries to
recognize the dangers of excessive fat consumption and take steps
to inform consumers about that,'' Fletcher said in a telephone
interview.
   But selling meat is also a business, he said, and ``the beef
industry wants to recover its market share; they have lost it
steadily to chicken and poultry in general over the past 10 years.''
   Fletcher said that occurred ``largely because of consumer
perception of beef as a high-fat food.''
   It was just a year ago that the Agriculture Department released
a study by Texas A&amp;M, led by Cross and Savell, that showed the
trimmable fat on retail cuts of beef had been reduced 27 percent in
two years.
   The $45,000 study, paid for by the beef industry and USDA,
showed that the average thickness of fat on steaks and roasts from
primal cuts, or the major wholesale cuts of beef, was 0.14 inch,
while the average for all cuts, from chuck roast to stew meat, was
0.11 inch, or less than one-eighth of an inch.
   Most retailers have been using a quarter-inch beef fat trim, or
less, since 1985, compared with a standard of half an inch before
that, according to the industry.
   At the conference, Cross said consumers have indicated they
would pay for more closely trimmed beef, preferably with external
fat of less than one-eighth inch.
   Internal fat, or marbling, has been a factor in the taste of
beef, and Cross said this still is important to consumers. The
challenge, he said, is take fat off, not out of beef.
   Cross said that Texas A&amp;M meat scientists are currently working
with human medicine researchers at Baylor College of Medicine and
the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center on projects
aimed at further improvements in the healthfulness of beef.
   The work includes modification of the fatty acid content of meat
product through changes in cattle feeds and products themselves.
Fatty acids can potentially elevate cholesterol levels in human
blood. But Cross said that even now, only 27 percent of the total
fat in beef is the type of saturated fatty acid that can raise
cholesterol.
   Savell told of recent research on the composition of cooked as
well as raw beef with reduced or no external fat. For example, if a
slice of beef with all the fat trimmed off is cooked, the fat
content of the interior meat is reduced by 20 percent from a slice
with a quarter-inch layer of fat.
   That is because less fat migrates from the outside into the meat
tissue.
   ``When you trim the fat off a steak that has a half inch of fat,
you get rid of half the total cholesterol,'' Savell said.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian gunners dueled with
mortars and rockets across Beirut on Thursday, shattering a
short-lived cease-fire and forcing panicked civilians back to
basements and bunkers.
   Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army claimed its troops held their
fire.
   Police said 15 people were wounded, bringing the toll to 177
people killed and 591 wounded since March 8, when Christian troops
clashed with an alliance of Syrian army and Druse militia forces.
   Police said Syrian gunners fired 50 rockets and mortar rounds
against the Christian enclave east and northeast of Beirut,
starting 11{ hours after the cease-fire was called at midnight.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be identified in line with
standing rules, said a dozen mortar rounds fired from east Beirut
slammed into residential districts of Moslem west Beirut.
   One Soviet-designed Grad rocket struck the Greek Orthodox church
of St Nicholas in the Ashrafiyeh district, destroying its
furnishings. The church was empty when hit, the spokesman said.
   Christian-controlled television showed rescuers trying to
salvage icons and other valuable objects from heaps of rubble in
the church, built in the 19th century.
   A police spokesman said the Christians kept the peace for nearly
three hours after the bombardment began. Then west Beirut was
shelled from ``emplacements in (Christian) east Beirut.''
   ``It is difficult to say who mans the guns: the army or the
Lebanese (Christian militia) Forces,'' said the spokesman, who
customarily is not identified by name.
   A telephone operator at Lebanese Forces headquarters said
spokesman George Abdelmasih was not available to answer questions.
   Aoun's spokesman insisted, ``The army is not responding to the
Syrian provocation.''
   Thursday's truce was called by Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik
Sabah Ahmed Sabah, who heads a six-nation Arab League committee on
Lebanon.
   ``We appeal to all the warring Lebanese parties to observe a
cease-fire as of midnight Wednesday,'' Sabah said in Damascus,
Syria, where he met Thursday with President Hafez Assad.
   Sabah left for home later, saying he had not heard from Aoun but
thought the cease-fire was accepted by most Lebanese leaders.
   As the deadly duel resumed, civilians who had emerged from bomb
shelters to stockpile food and assess damage rushed for refuge in
building entrances.
   Several motorists in the crowded Christian suburb of Dora
deserted their vehicles. Others honked their horns hysterically,
racing their cars in all directions and causing several accidents.
   Vendors in Moslem west Beirut scurried away from their
vegetables stands in Ein Mirreiseh district as mortars exploded
nearby.
   ``Peace didn't last for long. This is God's wrath at us,'' said
a woman carrying bread. She hurried along west Beirut's Hamra
street as shopkeepers lowered their shutters.
   The latest violence erupted after Aoun blockaded illegal
militia-run ports to reinstate tax collection worth $100 million a
year at government harbors along Lebanon's 130-mile Mediterranean
coast.
   In retaliation, militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt and
their Syrian allies besieged the 310-square-mile Christian enclave
northeast of the capital.
   Aoun, who also leads the Christian Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, has demanded Syria be a full party to a cease-fire,
claiming its soldiers are the main adversary to his 20,000 troops.
Syria keeps 40,000 troops in Lebanon under an Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa said in Damascus that
Syria is ``strongly boosting'' the Arab League's cease-fire appeal.
   ``Syria maintains and supports this appeal ... for our Lebanese
brothers to accept a cease-fire and lift the siege,'' he said.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads Lebanon's pro-Syrian
Moslem Cabinet, welcomed the cease-fire and urged ``all sides to
comply with the proposed truce out of mercy for the battered
population.''
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, does not control a militia and the
22,000-strong predominantly Moslem troops of Brig. Gen. Sami Khatib
have not been involved in the clashes.
   The dual government, which threatens to cement Lebanon's
partition into sectarian cantons, emerged last September after
parliament failed to elect a successor to outgoing President Amin
Gemayel.

<HEAD>Bush Names Special Envoy to Afghan Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, bowing to congressional
pressure, has chosen Peter Tomsen as a special envoy to the Afghan
rebels battling the Soviet-backed regime in Kabul, administration
sources said Thursday.
   Tomsen, the deputy chief of the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, has not
formally been selected, but sources who spoke on condition they not
be identified by name confirmed he was the choice of Bush and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The move stops short of offering formal recognition of the
Afghan government-in-exile, but it is seen as a means of broadening
U.S. influence among the long-feuding rebel factions and curbing
Paskistan's clout.
   The post carries the rank of ambassador. Tomsen will be based in
Washington and travel frequently to the region, said an
administration official who spoke on the condition he not be
identified. The name has not formally been announced because it
``hasn't been put through all the administrative hoops yet,'' said
the official.
   The move drew immediate criticism from the Soviet Union. In
Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh accused the
United States of ``plans to break off relations with the Afghan
government'' and preparing to recognize a ``self-imposed
government.''
   ``The United States does not want to extinguish the flames in
Afghanistan. They make every effort to topple the government in
Afghanistan,'' Gremitskikh said, repeating Soviet charges that the
administration was failing to uphold the Geneva accords that
oversaw the withdrawal of Soviet troops in February.
   The United States closed its embassy in Kabul several weeks ago,
as the situation in the city deteriorated after the Soviet pullout.
Formal diplomatic ties were not broken, however.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, who confirmed
the decision about the envoy had been named but refused to identify
him, said the move did not entail a recognition of the rebel's
government-in-exile or establish diplomatic relations with it.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who pushed a law through Congress
last year requiring the appointment of such a special ambassador,
said he was ``elated'' by the reported decision.
   Humphrey acknowledged that he had backed an Afghan-born Rand
Corp. scholar for the post, Zalmy Khalilzad, who is now a U.S.
citizen, for the job. Khalilzad speaks Afghanistan's two languages,
Dari and Pashtu, which Tomsen does not.
   But the senator said he was pleased that the administration
appeared to be moving toward developing policy for dealing with the
fluid situation in Afghanistan and he hoped the move was a step
toward the eventual recognition
   ``It does raise the credibility of the resistance,'' he said.
   The senator argued that the high-level posting was needed to
curb Pakistan's influence over the rebels, now that the Soviet
troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan and the insurgents are
battling the Kabul regime.
   ``Pakistan's goals _ whatever they are in the region _ may not
wholly be in agreement with our own. The United States needs to
take some new initiative ... we need a policy with momentum ,''
Humphrey said in a telephone interview.
   The United States has funneled support to the rebels through
Pakistan, which has continued to back radical Moslem fundamentalist
rebels over more moderate factions.
   Some U.S. officials have privately expressed concerns about
powerful resistance leaders who advocate restructuring Afghan
society along strict Islamic fundamentalist lines.

<TEXT>
   A government minister said Thursday the
seven-year ban on Solidarity would be lifted immediately, and Lech
Walesa urged supporters to put their ``political victory'' into
action by organizing nationwide.
   ``The process of legalization of Solidarity should be completed
between April 15 and April 20,'' said Sports Minister Aleksander
Kwasniewski, a chief negotiator for the communist government in two
months of talks with the opposition that concluded Wednesday in a
broad accord.
   Kwasniewski said the Sejm, or parliament, would meet Friday to
enact the agreements on trade union freedoms, economic reforms and
political changes, including creation of the first freely elected
legislative body in the East bloc.
   Walesa, looking relaxed at a news conference after a grueling
week of negotiations, outlined the tasks his independent trade
union faces. But he warned the agreement could lead to disaster if
Poland failed to take advantage of the changes.
   ``The most important task for today is to write applications
immediately all over the country to provincial governors and city
mayors so we get the technical possibility to organize as soon as
possible,'' Walesa said.
   The agreement allows Solidarity to organize on a national,
regional and local level after parliament makes the necessary
changes in the labor law to permit more than one legal trade union
at a workplace.
   On the national level, the union plans to form an organizing
committee as early as this weekend to apply for formal registration
by submitting a new union charter in court, said top Solidarity
adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki.
   ``Today we as Poland have a great victory, but a political
victory _ a theoretical one which may turn out to be a victory or a
disaster if we are not able to make use of it,'' Walesa said.
   ``If we are not able to work in the economic field to have more,
produce more and better and in the political field to represent
ourselves well ... nice slogans will only stay slogans,'' Walesa
said.
   The government daily Rzeczpospolita called the agreements sealed
by Walesa and Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, the interior minister, a
breakthrough that created a chance that must not be wasted by
``false solutions, sham ambitions or ignorance of realities.''
   Stanislaw Ciosek, a Politburo member and participant in the
talks, said the agreement was a step toward reforms undertaken by
the Communist Party, but it would not solve all of Poland's
problems.
   ``These reforms have made the prospect of satisfying the working
class much closer,'' Ciosek said. ``In spite of what I said before,
one should not expect that the agreement reached should eliminate
all concerns and troubles.''
   Walesa appeared unconcerned by the apparent lack of reaction by
Poles to the restoration of the Soviet bloc's first independent
trade union, which claimed 10 million members and ignited that
nation's spirit during its 16-month legal existence before being
crushed under martial law in December 1981.
   ``I went on the hotel balcony today and watched people's
behavior. I met with great sympathy, almost everyone waved, but
also with a lot of doubt,'' Walesa said.
   He said the union had trouble before with expectations that were
too high, so today's skepticism is good.
   Walesa said he expected Solidarity to attract 5 million to 7
million members, but that he would like to see at least three
competing trade unions.
   Walesa and his advisers have said the shift in the attitude of
the Polish leadership toward Solidarity is partially due to changes
in the political climate in the Soviet Union.
   Walesa said he would like to see what is happening in the Soviet
Union for himself and added: ``I would not like to disturb
perestroika and reforms. That country is reforming itself as far as
we hear. ... We want to solve our (problems) and not disturb
others.''
   He later flew to his home in the port city of Gdansk, where
Solidarity was founded, and told reporters the union would like to
use the Monopol Hotel in Warsaw as its national headquarters.
   Kwasniewski said the government had urged local and regional
authorities to support the registration process of new unions and
provide them with office space.
   Authorities proposed the talks in August during the year's
second nationwide wave of strikes. When work stoppages appeared
again this year, Walesa appealed for calm to give the negotiations
a chance.
   Both sides have expressed hope the solutions reached at the
talks that began Feb. 6 will repair the economy and revive the
dispirited population.
   In addition to Solidarity, authorities agreed to restore legal
status to the farmers' union Rural Solidarity and the Independent
Students Association, all banned during martial law.
   In exchange, the opposition agreed to participate in June
elections to the 460-member Sejm that guarantee the Communist Party
and its allies a 65 percent majority.
   But at the same time, Poland will have its first democratic
elections since World War II, creating a new 100-member Senate.
   A presidency also will be created, to be elected by the Sejm and
the senate. The president would be elected this year for a six-year
term and the post is expected to go to Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski,
the Communist Party leader, due to his party's dominance in the
larger Sejm.

<HEAD>3rd World Debt Falls Heavily on Children, Actress Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Third-world debt is imposing its heaviest
burden on millions of children whose countries are cutting social
programs to keep up payments loans from foreign banks, actress
Audrey Hepburn told Congress Thursday.
   Accompanying declining spending by developing countries for
health and education is a more alarming statistic, she said: the
average weight-for-age figure is falling in many of the countries.
   ``In other words, ... the children of the developing world are
paying for the Third World's $1.3 billion debt with their health,
education and even their lives,'' she told the House Appropriations
foreign operations subcommittee.
   ``At least half a million young children have died in the last
12 months as a result of the slowing down or reversal of progress
in the developing world,'' said Hepburn, who is a ``goodwill
ambassador'' for the United Nations Children's Fund.
   UNICEF, she said, is able to use its implicit trust to help
alleviate those conditions in places such as the drought-stricken
Sudan, where aid to starving people has been stalled because of a
civil war.
   ``Everybody trusts you because everybody loves a child,''
Hepburn said in response to a question from chairman David Obey,
D-Wis.
   ``It's something everybody has in common. ... Children may
eventually be the cause of peace in these countries. What they need
most is peace. But they can't wait and UNICEF is taking care of
them.''
   UNICEF is a perennial favorite on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers
have restored some $100 million in cuts proposed by the Reagan
administration over the last four years, according to the
subcommittee's figures.

<TEXT>
   The United States and Italy on Thursday signed
an agreement calling for increased cooperation in the fight against
terrorism, drug trafficking and organized crime.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, signing the classified
document at FBI headquarters, said the two countries had ``adopted
ambitious proposals'' for combating crimes and terrorism.
   ``Our agreement expresses in unmistakable terms the strength of
our partnership and the vigor of our commitment,'' he said in brief
remarks.
   The agreement was worked out by two groups of American and
Italian experts over three days of talks this week. The experts
have been meeting regularly over the last five years to improve
cooperation between the two countries.
   Italian Interior Minister Antonio Gava said both sides had
agreed they would have to be ``on a war footing'' in the fight
against ``the international cancer'' of drugs, organized crime and
terrorism.
   The projects undertaken by the two nations in their agreement
include cooperation on extradition, on increasing the exchange of
information about terrorist activities, on money laundering by drug
traffickers, and on upgrading enforcement of racketeering laws,
said an Italian source. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Specifics of the agreement were not divulged.
   Gava, addressing the experts earlier, said organized crime
groups in Italy and the United States have been increasing their
cooperation in recent years.
   He also said a link between drug trafficking and terrorism was
becoming apparent. He did not elaborate.

   A Common Pleas Court judge ruled Thursday
that mob boss Nicodemo ``Little Nicky'' Scarfo and seven associates
must be sentenced to life in prison instead of death for killing a
gangster.
   Judge Eugene Clarke took the decision away from the jury on
grounds that prosecutors failed to show sufficient aggravating
circumstances for a death sentence to be imposed.
   Because only a jury can impose a death sentence, the eight men
convicted in the 1985 slaying of Frank ``Frankie Flowers''
D'Alfonso will automatically be sentenced to life in prison.
   Friends and relatives of the eight broke out in applause as the
judge announced his decision.
   During the sentencing phase of the trial Thursday, city police
firearms examiner John Finor testified bystanders were nearby when
D'Alfonso was shot on a South Philadelphia street corner.
   But Clarke ruled that was not an aggravating circumstance
necessary for the death penalty under Pennsylvania law.
   The decision came a day after jurors convicted Scarfo and the
others of first-degree murder, conspiracy and the possession of an
instrument of crime in the July 23, 1985, shooting of D'Alfonso
near his home as he paused to light a cigarette.
   Government witnesses said D'Alfonso was murdered because he
failed to show Scarfo proper respect as head of organized crime in
the Philadelphia-southern New Jersey area.
   Scarfo, 60, already is serving a 14-year sentence in a $1
million extortion case and faces at least 40 more years in a
federal racketeering case.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks to Encourage Implementation of Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is preparing a package
of measures designed to encourage Poland's communist authorities to
implement democratic reforms they agreed to this week, officials
said Thursday.
   The package, to be announced as early as Friday, would include
economic and possibly political concessions to Poland, said two
administration officials who spoke on condition they not be
identified. They declined to give specifics.
   A Polish government spokesman said it was asking the United
States to give the green light to loans from the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and from other Western governments.
   ``What we want does not lie in the bilateral range of things,
not trade,'' said Polish Embassy spokesman Mierik Miernik.
   Poland's efforts to rebuild its shattered economy have been
hampered by an inflation rate of between 60 and 100 percent, and a
$39 billion foreign debt. The Polish government would like U.S.
support in persuading the Paris Club of bankers and governments to
reschedule repayment of the loans, Miernik said.
   Although the United States lifted the sanctions it imposed after
communist authorities declared martial law in Poland in 1981, it
has been pressuring Western banks and governments against extending
new credits to Warsaw, he said.
   Forty congressmen have also urged the administration to
influence the IMF, World Bank and Paris Club to relieve debt
pressure on Poland.
   The congressmen, including House Democratic Whip Tony Coelho of
California and Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia, said that
with the reforms in place, ``Poland should maintain a primary
position on America's foreign policy agenda.''
   ``Now that Poland seems on the threshold of monumental reform,
the struggle of the Polish people should not slip down on our list
of priorities,'' said the letter initiated by Rep. William O.
Lipinski, D-Ill.
   One step might be allowing the government's Overseas Private
Investment Corporation to insure investments by Americans in Polish
agriculture or other economic enterprises, said an aide to Lipinski.
   State Department and White House officials have been preparing a
package of conciliatory measures for several weeks, with an eye to
negotiations involving Poland's communist authorities, Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, representatives of the Roman Catholic church
and others.
   Walesa and Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak concluded the
talks and announced the accords on Wednesday. They include the
first free elections since the communists took over Poland after
World War II and legalization of the Solidarity trade union after
eight years of suppression.
   State Department analysts, who have scrutinized the agreement,
said they were impressed its constitutional provisions.
   It creates a strong presidency, recreates an upper house of
parliament, and eliminates over time the communists' guaranteed
majority in the lower house of parliament, meaning they ultimately
could lose control of the country, said a State Department analyst
who asked not to be identified.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday that
President Bush hailed the ``accords that have started Poland on
this new path of reconciliation.''
   ``We feel very confident about the process that is under way in
Poland,'' Fitzwater said. ``Now that we have these accords, we are
considering issues or moves that might be taken which would, in
various ways, foster economic development and help move that
process forward.''

<HEAD>USDA Says It's Too Early For Drought Relief For Winter Wheat Growers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite pleas for help from Congress, the
Agriculture Department said Thursday it was too early to advance a
new drought relief package to aid winter wheat growers facing
potential losses from dry weather and temperature extremes.
   ``We don't know there is going to be a widespread disaster,''
Ewen M. Wilson, USDA's assistant secretary for economics, told a
House Agriculture subcommittee.
   Frustrated by the wait-and-see approach, a Kansas lawmaker
introduced legislation to extend drought assistance approved last
year by Congress to farmers of winter wheat planted in 1988.
   ``It is my people. We are suffering. We were able to work with
corn country last year. It is our time,'' said Rep. Pat Roberts,
R-Kan., who represents a 58-county district considered one of the
prime wheat-growing regions in the nation.
   According to USDA, the winter wheat outlook is bleak in Kansas,
traditionally the nation's largest producer. At the start of the
month, 70 percent of the Kansas wheat crop was rated poor to very
poor. Kansas normally accounts for 17 percent of total U.S. wheat
production and 35 percent of the nation's hard red winter wheat,
the main bread wheat.
   In testimony to the wheat, soybeans and feed grains
subcommittee, USDA officials conceded that drought could sharply
reduce harvests in portions of the major winter wheat states of
Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska and Colorado. However, they held
hope that spring rains could rescue part of the crop.
   Norton Strommen, USDA's chief meterologist, said the next 30 to
60 days will be critical. He said the 90-day weather outlook
suggested near-normal rainfall in much of the Wheat Belt across the
the Great Plains, although below normal rainfall is expected in the
short term.
   Because the winter wheat crop is developing later than usual
this year, Strommen said, ``we have a mixed picture.''
   ``It's just a little premature to start to write the crop down
to any specific level,'' said Strommen. ``We simply have to watch
and wait for the development and the timing and distribution of
rainfall in the next two months.''
   Lawmakers unsuccessfully pressed USDA to support a new
legislative relief package or extending the 1988 drought assistance
programs to the 1989 wheat crop.
   Wilson said USDA ``doesn't want to do anything precipitous.''
   ``We will have to monitor the situation and see if it rains and
see how bad it is,'' he said.
   For the major winter wheat states, Wilson said, 31 percent of
the overall crop was rated poor to very poor compared to 8 percent
last year at this time.
   According to a ``highly tentative'' projection by USDA, total
1989 wheat production could be about 2.45 billion bushels, a 35
percent boost from last year's drought-reduced harvest.
   At the hearing, John Schnittker, a private agricultural analyst,
estimated a harvest of 2.25-2.3 billion bushels. He warned that a
poor U.S. winter wheat crop would drastically shrink already small
grain stockpiles and pose ``a serious threat to world food
sufficiency and price stability.''

   Representatives of Salvadoran rebels
challenged the newly elected Arena party Thursday to declare its
administration a ``government of transition'' or face a deepening
of the nine-year-old war in the Central American country.
   Guadelupe Gonzales of the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front said the proposal was being announced in
Washington because president-elect Alfredo Cristiani is here for
talks with U.S. officials.
   Francisco Altschul, a representative of the political opposition
commission of the rebel group, said the proposal was presented
Thursday to representatives of Arena and other Salvadoran factions.
   He said he knew of no response.
   Cristiani has a news conference scheduled Friday morning and
will meet with President Bush in the afternoon.
   Asked what would happen if Arena rejects the proposal, Altschul
said, ``We hope it is not rejected. Unless there is a negotiated
settlement of the war, there is only going to be an ungovernable
country; there is only going to be a deepening of the war.''
   Meanwhile in San Salvador the leftist guerrillas attacked the
4th Army brigade headquarters and the headquarters of army
engineers, authorities said. Three soldiers and three guerrillas
were reported killed and 10 people wounded.
   More than 70,000 Salvadorans, most of them civilians, have been
killed during the nine-year war against the U.S.-supported
government.
   The rebels have stepped up attacks recently to protest the
election of Cristiani, a right-wing businessman who was the
candidate of Arena, in an election March 9. Cristiani is scheduled
to take office June 1.
   Altschul told reporters that Arena, named for its initials in
Spanish, ``has made it very clear that it will follow a policy of
massacres and total war and has given no indication of a serious
disposition toward peace.''
   He said the rebels would seek a response from Arena to demands
that it stop assassinations, respect nationalization of banks and
other steps taken by its predecessors and abandon its insistence
that the guerrillas surrender.
   He said this would be ``a first step to start serious
negotiations.''
   ``In order to resolve the problem of the war in a definitive
manner, it is necessary to revise the constitution and for the
future Arena government to declare itself a government of
transition,'' the proposal said.
   It called for elections in which the army would be confined to
barracks and the rebel military forces also kept away from voting
places for three days before, during and after the voting.
   It called for the rebel faction to ``participate directly as a
political force in these elections with our flag and in coalition
with other parties which may be disposed to participate together
with us.''
   It said that commanders and officers implicated in ``political
crimes and massacres which have been causes of the war'' must be
brought to justice.
   The rebels also demanded that U.S. aid be cut off and U.S.
advisors withdrawn.
   Elections would be held within six months after initiation of a
cease fire.

<HEAD>Bush May Order Military to Help Out</HEAD>

   President Bush may order the military to help
in the long-term cleanup of the massive oil spill in Alaska, it was
disclosed Thursday as the administration underscored its opposition
to a federal takeover of the operation.
   ``There's a lot of military already in Alaska,'' White House
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, adding that those troops
were the most likely to be tapped.
   Fitzwater said Alaska's congressional delegation had asked
officials to consider using the military _ ``and we are.'' He said
the armed forces could help in washing oil from animals and birds
plus cleaning up rocks and shorelines and then continue in the
long-term effort.
   Asked when the military might begin the work, Fitzwater said,
``Beginning about now.'' He said a final decision was still
pending. ``The concern is, we need a comprehensive way to deal with
this continuing and long-term cleanup.''
   The White House is under pressure to take charge of cleaning up
the largest oil spill in U.S. history.
   ``We've got to have federal control now,'' Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, told Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner at the first
of several congressional hearings on efforts to deal with the
nation's worst oil tanker disaster.
   While Stevens was joined by other senators who suggested that
the president order a greater federal involvement in the cleanup in
Alaska's Prince William Sound, Skinner and Admiral Paul Yost, the
commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard, cautioned against turning
control of the effort over to the federal government.
   ``I am not prepared to federalize this spill,'' Yost told the
Senate Commerce Committee, adding that such a move might leave an
opening for Exxon ``to close their checkbook'' and force the
government to assume cleanup costs.
   He said the Coast Guard has just $3 million or so in the fund
that would be used for such a task, only enough for a few days.
   That concern was not shared by Stevens, who said that the
government could still tap an industry disaster fund of up to $100
million to cover the costs and that Exxon likely would not be
relieved of liabilities in any event.
   Nevertheless, Yost said the Coast Guard was planning to assume
greater direction over Exxon Corp. in deciding how to go about the
cleanup, what equipment to use and what the priorities should be.
   ``We're going to do much more coordination and guidance,'' Yost
said, acknowledging that Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper had asked for
greater Coast Guard involvement in a letter received Monday night.
   L.G. Rawls, chairman of Exxon Corp., told the Senate panel that
the petroleum giant ``will continue doing all we can to clean up
and mitigate the spill's effects.''
   ``We're chasing the oil. We're doing what we can,'' said the
Exxon chief executive.
   Meanwhile, a group of Republican congressmen said Bush should
become more directly involved in the matter and put a federal
agency in overall charge of the effort.
   At a news conference called by the House Republican Research
Committee, Rep. Jim Saxton of New Jersey said he has received
offers from people willing to travel to Alaska to help, but has not
found any government agency that can provide information on what
steps such volunteers should take.
   While the debate continued on what steps need to be taken to
protect wildlife, fish and the ecology of Prince William Sound,
officials agreed the early response to the March 24 accident in
which the Exxon Valdez supertanker ran aground, spilling more than
10 million gallons of oil, was largely bungled and probably was
inadequate even if events had run more smoothly.
   William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, told the Senate panel the petroleum industry's emergency
reaction plan and the environmental impact analysis in connection
with the Alaskan pipeline did not contemplate such a massive spill.
   Skinner said that while all is being done now that can be done
to deal with the spill, the response on the first two days after
the accident was inadequate. ``They hadn't planned for a catstrophe
of this magnitude,'' he told the senators.
   The contingency plan, for example, called for booms to be put
around the stricken tanker within five hours, but the booms were
not in place until 12 hours after the accident and then did not
hold because of strong winds, Yost said.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said the basic response plan was
faulty, noting that when it was developed the largest oil spill
anticipated was 74,000 barrels. The oil that gushed from the Exxon
Valdez was more than three times that amount and came out at a rate
of 50,000 barrels an hour, according to administration officials.

<HEAD>Official Media Praise Visit to London, Twit the British</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet media painted a generally glowing picture
Thursday of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's first day in London,
but twitted his British hosts on a few points.
   The nightly news program ``Vremya'' devoted more than 20 minutes
to the visit and reported no disagreement with Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher beyond Gorbachev's friendly correction of her
estimate of how long they had talked.
   A commentary in the government newspaper Izvestia, however,
combined praise for Mrs. Thatcher's recent statement that the Cold
War is over with a review of issues that remain in contention.
   Columnists A. Krivopalov and M. Sturua wrote that each side
questions the other's performance on human rights.
   They said Izvestia's London bureau frequently has its attention
called to British conduct in Northern Ireland and to allegedly
unjust convictions by British courts.
   Krivopalov and Sturua accused Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British
foreign secretary, of ``playing political games.''
   On the 40th anniversary of the NATO, they wrote, Howe ``allowed
himself remarks which clearly carry the flavor of the old days. He
once again spoke about `the Russian bear,' which he said represents
a military threat to the West.''
   In truth, they declared, recent polls indicate most Britons
perceive the Soviet threat as much smaller since Gorbachev came to
power in 1985.
   Izvestia also said the growth of British-Soviet trade ``is
restrained by discriminatory measures introduced by the British
authorities on various Soviet products, by the ban on export to the
U.S.S.R. of contemporary industrial equipment and the newest
technology.''
   Accompanying the complaint was an acknowledgment that the
lethargic and ponderous Soviet financial system also is at fault.
   Despite their differences, Britain and the Soviet Union are part
of a growing consensus that Europe must coalesce into ``one general
European home,'' the paper said, and expressed hope the
Gorbachev-Thatcher meeting would bring progress toward that goal.
   Reports on state television and by the official news agency Tass
covered the visit in detail, from the landing at Heathrow Airport
to a visit by the Soviet leader's wife Raisa to Saint Paul's
Cathedral.
   Tass described Westminster Abbey, which Gorbachev toured
Thursday afternoon, as ``a positive jewel of ancient English
culture.''
   In a report on his stop at a communications firm that does
business with the Soviet Union, the agency said ``British people
are not yet satisfied'' with the rate of growth in trade between
the two countries.

<TEXT>
   The operator of the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline terminal announced Thursday that it will immediately
require random drug and alcohol testing on all vessels using the
terminal.
   The action was one of several announced by Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co., a consortium of seven oil companies that owns and
operates the Valdez terminal and the 800-mile pipeline. Alyeska has
been criticized for its slow response to the nation's worst oil
spill.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez took on a load at Valdez on March 24 and
hours later ran aground, releasing more than 10 million gallons of
crude oil into Prince William Sound. The ship's captain, Joseph
Hazelwood, is charged with operating the vessel while drunk.
   Alyeska said in a news release that it would require tanker
owners and operators to institute random drug and alcohol testing.
It also said it would require tugboat escorts for all entering and
departing vessels to a point beyond Bligh Reef, where the Exxon
Valdez ran aground.
   The state this week drafted an emergency order that, if signed,
would require Alyeska immediately to take several steps to correct
problems with its oil-spill response program. Some of those steps,
including the purchase of additional booms, dispersants and other
cleanup equipment, were included in Alyeska's announcement Thursday.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, was expected to sign the order, Deputy
Commissioner Amy Kyle said.
   The draft order sharply criticizes Alyeska's initial response to
the spill, saying it failed to comply with its spill contingency
plan and took too long to deploy equipment. The order says
``continued operation of Alyeska's marine terminal and tanker
traffic at the current crude-oil flow rate creates a substantial
risk of an additional oil spill'' in the sound.
   Alyeska said a task force of oil company officials will make
additional recommendations to improve spill response.
   ``We sincerely regret the environmental tragedy in Prince
William Sound and pledge to do everything feasible to prevent
another such accident from happening,'' the news release said. ``A
painful lesson has been learned.''

<HEAD>Soviets Buy Corn; Chinese, Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has bought more U.S. corn and
China has been sold wheat at subsidized prices, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   Officials said that the Soviet purchase was for 400,000 metric
tons of corn to be delivered this year and that the wheat sale to
China was for 300,000 tons. Both deliveries are scheduled for this
year.
   More than 2.7 million tons have been purchased since the Soviets
rsumed buying U.S. corn on March 28 after a layoff of almost three
months.
   The latest sales brought total corn sold to the Soviets for
1988-89 to almost 13 million tons. Additionally, sales include 4
million tons of wheat, 450,000 tons of soybeans, 1.4 million tons
of soybean meal and 507,400 tons of grain sorghum.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 400,000 tons of
corn woud be about 15.8 million bushels.
   Corn prices have been averaging about $2.45 per bushel at the
farm level, according to the latest USDA five-day average, meaning
that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $39 million.
   John J. Reddington, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said the wheat was part
of 2 million tons authorized Feb. 27 for China under the Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   The latest sale boosted to about 8.5 million tons the amount of
wheat sold to China for 1988-89 delivery under EEP.
   Reddington said the latest sales were handled by Garnac Grain
Co. Inc., 50,000 tons; Bunge Corp., 50,000; Bartlett and Co.,
100,000, and Continental Grain Co., 100,000.
   He said the wheat will carry an average subsidy rate of $6.33
per ton, or about 17 cents a bushel. About 910,000 tons are still
available under the current authorization.
   The 300,000 tons of wheat would be about 11 million bushels and,
at recent prices of about $3.96 per bushel, would have a farm value
of around $44 million.

<HEAD>Author Who Stole Library Books Released From Jail Early</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A novelist and former Oscar
nominee jailed for stealing thousands of books from more than 70
libraries in two countries was released 88 days early so he could
get back to work.
   Jerry Gustav Hasford, 41, who co-wrote the screenplay for the
1987 film ``Full Metal Jacket,'' had become a ``high-profile
prisoner and the subject of verbal abuse from other prisoners,''
said Orlan Donley, Hasford's attorney.
   Hasford was released Tuesday, 28 days before he would have been
eligible for parole and 88 days before he would have finished his
six-month sentence.
   Donley told Judge Warren Conklin of San Luis Obispo County
Superior Court that Hasford had a chance to go to France to work on
a movie based on a book he recently had published. Hasford is also
working on a deal with a publisher for three more books, Donley
said.
   Hasford's income depends on his writing and he can't write in
jail because of the harassment, the attorney argued.
   Conklin said he released Hasford because the writer had a job,
had agreed to pay restitution and agreed to let authorities
determine which books belonged to him and which should be returned.
Hasford can leave the state and country, but must report to his
probation officer in writing, Conklin said.
   Hasford wrote ``The Short-Timers,'' based on his experience as a
combat correspondent with the 1st Marine Division during the Tet
Offensive of 1968.
   Stanley Kubrick bought the rights to the book for ``Full Metal
Jacket,'' in which Hasford shares screenwriting credit with Kubrick
and Michael Herr. The screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award
in 1987, but the honor went to authors of ``The Last Emperor.''
   About 10,000 books were confiscated when Hasford was arrested,
but charges against Hasford focused only on 2,000 books valued at
about $20,000. They were taken from public libraries in Los
Angeles; Santa Monica; Sacramento; St. Louis; Longview, Wash.;
London; and the city, county and university libraries in San Luis
Obispo.
   Hasford pleaded no contest in January to possessing stolen
property as part of a negotiated agreement with prosecutors, who
dropped two criminal counts of grand theft.
   Police officers at California Polytechnic State University in
San Luis Obispo have been storing the books since they were
confiscated. Officer Raymond Berrett will decide which ones are
Hasford's and which ones belong to libraries, Donley said.

   A House subcommittee voted Thursday to end the
remaining price controls on natural gas in 1993.
   A decade ago, the action of the energy and power subcommittee of
the House Energy and Commerce Committee would have followed battles
between consuming and producing states.
   Memories of those battles led Congress and its committees to
ignore the Reagan administration's almost annual requests for
removal of controls.
   Thursday, it took only 12{ minutes for the subcommittee to
approve, by voice vote and without dissent, the bill sponsored by
22 of its 23 members.
   A previous decontrol episode in 1985 saw prices collapse,
confounding predictions of a pocketbook-bashing ``fly-up'' of
prices. Many analysts now believe gas prices are determined by oil
prices because many industrial users can switch between the two.
   Most believe decontrol will have little immediate effect if
demand does not increase as ceiling prices frequently are well
above spot prices.
   The last major gas pricing battle in Congress came in 1978, when
harsh winters, diversion of gas into unregulated intrastate markets
and soaring oil prices all combined to curtail gas deliveries to
the Midwest and Northeast.
   To encourage new production, Congress enacted several different
prices for gas according to source, such as tight sands or very
deep wells, and permitted those prices to rise with inflation. It
also provided that much of that gas would be decontrolled in 1985,
as it was.
   But gas from existing wells was to remain under price controls.
That gas is a smaller percentage of the supply every year and today
is 25 percent to 30 percent of gas flowing through pipelines,
according to the Natural Gas Supply Association.
   Since 1985, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has
declared that the ceiling price of certain gas could rise to the
price of the most expensive category.
   That ceiling price, which rises with inflation, is now $2.79 per
thousand cubic feet. The March average spot price in major
producing states, according to the newsletter Natural Gas
Intelligence, was $1.44. Some old gas is sold for 30 cents.
   The bill does not abrogate contracts. Some contracts provide for
market pricing under decontrol but others do not.

   Astronaut Hoot Wilson was the best-known
member of Huntington High School's class of '64 _ until Capt.
Joseph J. Hazelwood was fired and then arrested for his role in the
nation's biggest oil spill.
   Hazelwood, 42, released Thursday on $25,000 bail, is accused of
being drunk on March 24 when his ship, the Exxon Valdez, ripped its
bottom open and ran aground just 25 miles from Valdez, Alaska,
pouring more than 10 million gallons of crude oil into Prince
William Sound.
   Although Hazelwood had problems with alcohol, his life was
otherwise as obscure as those of his other high school classmates.
   ``He wasn't a wild kid. He was never in any trouble,'' Stuart
Lifson, a member of the class of '64, told Newsday. ``He is a very
inconspicuous person.''
   Hazelwood was raised in Huntington, a Long Island suburb, and
still lives there with his wife and their daughter. He was one of
four children; his father was a captain for Pan American World
Airways.
   During high school, Hazelwood participated in gymnastics and
tennis.
   After graduation, he went to Maritime College and left as a deck
officer on June 5, 1968. Soon after, he began a career with Exxon.
   By the time he was 31, Hazelwood had already received his
master's license, permitting him to run a ship of any size.
   At the time of the oil spill, Hazelwood was one of the youngest
captains in the merchant marine, running one of Exxon's newest
tankers. After the spill, Exxon fired him.
   Ironically, while he held a lofty position on the water,
Hazelwood was barred from driving a car because of a drunken
driving conviction.
   The first sign of his troubles with alcohol came on July 21,
1981, when Hazelwood was charged with driving while intoxicated and
leaving the scene of an accident. He later pleaded guilty and was
fined $510.
   Hazelwood was later sued by a seaman who alleged the captain had
abused him over a period of several years, court papers showed. The
lawsuit, still pending, does not detail the alleged abuse.
   In 1984, Hazelwood's driving license was revoked after he
refused a breath test following another car accident. He entered a
state-required rehabilitation program as part of his sentence in
that case.
   ``I do know that he had a problem with alcohol in the past. I
know he was rehabilitated. Exxon knows it,'' said his mother,
Margaret Hazelwood.
   His drivers license was restored in May 1986, but revoked again
after a September 1988 drunken driving conviction in North Conway,
N.H.
   Hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while drunk, reckless
endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The misdemeanors carry
a maximum penalty of 2\ years in prison and a $10,000 fine upon
conviction.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev complained
to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Thursday that a 2{-month-old
U.S. foreign policy review threatens the momentum of arms control
talks, a Soviet spokesman said.
   President Bush ordered the review after he took office in
January. It is still under way, and Bush has said he will not be
``stampeded'' by Soviet initiatives.
   ``In general we are not happy with the West's answer _ or maybe
non-answer _ to Soviet initiatives in the field of disarmament,''
Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told
reporters after Gorbachev and Mrs. Thatcher met for four hours.
   ``We understand that the new administration needs time to study
foreign policy because there are new faces there and some of them
don't know what foreign policy is about,'' he said.
   But he said Gorbachev told Mrs. Thatcher the Soviets ``don't
want this pause to become an interval which will lead to losing
momentum in this process of disarmament.''
   ``But still I think overall we must say that the atmosphere for
disarmament talks is extremely favorable now,'' Gerasimov said.
   East-West negotiations began in Vienna last month on reducing
conventional weapons in Europe, but U.S.-Soviet negotiations on
reducing long-range nuclear weapons have been postponed
indefinitely.
   The Reagan administration aimed for a 50 percent reduction in
strategic nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines. But an
agreement was blocked by Soviet concerns over the U.S. Strategic
Defense Initiative and difficulties over verifying compliance with
an accord.
   Gerasimov said Gorbachev did not specifically ask Mrs. Thatcher,
a staunch U.S. ally, to take up the Soviet concerns with Bush. ``We
just expressed our concern,'' he said.
   Asked what the Soviets believed was causing the delay in
formulating U.S. foreign policy, Gerasimov said his view was that
the Bush administration was trying ``to please everybody.''
   The Soviets also ``feel a certain influence'' of old Soviet
hands like former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and
former U.S. National Security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, ``who
tend to interpret Soviet-American relations in terms of
confrontation,'' he said.

   A group of Jewish radicals announced Thursday
it would send its members to the occupied West Bank to defend
Israeli settlers if Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir orders the
pullout of his troops from the territories.
   The Jewish Defense League said it had been getting calls from
settlers concerned that Shamir, under U.S. pressure, would agree to
pull Israeli troops out of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Shamir is reportedly considering pulling troops out of densely
populated Palestinian areas to ease the tensions that have fueled a
15-month Palestinian rebellion that has resulted in more than 400
Arab deaths.
   An estimated 70,000 Jews, many of them of American origin, live
in small settlements among the 1.3 million Palestinian inhabitants
of the territories. Israeli troops are charged with protecting the
settlers, although most of them also have their own weapons and
some have conducted vigilante activity against Palestinians.
   Michael Shlomich, who identified himself as the East Coast
coordinator for the JDL, said in a telephone call from Boston that
his organization ``will not allow the settlers to be slaughtered by
Arab mobs and terrorists.''
   He said the JDL, which in the 1960s and 1970s allegedly carried
out attacks on Arabs and Russians in the United States, would send
``highly trained people in riot control'' to protect the settlers
if the troops leave.

   A U.S. review panel has recommended upholding
Israel's trading privileges with the United States, rejecting a
suit filed by an Arab-American group, sources said Thursday.
   The ruling by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative has
been submitted to President Bush for his approval and an
announcement is expected next week, the agency said.
   A spokeswoman for the trade representative declined to discuss
the panel's findings, but other officials said a complaint filed
against Israeli labor practices by an the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee last year had been rejected.
   The committee, which lobbies for the rights of Arab-Americans,
last year accused Israel of violating international labor and
union-protection laws for thousands of Palestinians who work in
Israel and in its occupied territories.
   According to U.S. law, Israel stood to lose trading privileges
it enjoys under the General System of Preferences, which grants
dozens of countries the right to export products to the United
States free of duties.
   The United States agreed to investigate the complaint, along
with petitions against Haiti, Liberia, Malaysia and Syria, and held
hearings late last year.
   The trade panel found that Israel had taken steps in recent
months to rectify some violations of workers' rights.
   The panel declined to rule on the complaint about Israeli
practices in the occupied West Bank and Gaza, citing U.S. policy of
not recognizing Israel's legal rights over the predominantly Arab
land, said another source who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   That ruling was based on a recommendation from the State
Department's legal adviser, said the source.
   Abdeen Jabara, who heads the ADC, said that the very fact that
hearings were held on Israel's labor practices toward Palestinians
``was an important and positive thing because it raises the
consciousness of how Palestinians are treated by Israel.''
   He said the finding that some rights had been violated means
that Israel ``has not been given a clean bill of health.''

<HEAD>Law Students Across Nation Protest Shortage Of Minority Faculty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT W. TROTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at law schools scattered around the country called a
strike Thursday to protest a lack of minority faculty members.
Fledgling lawyers at Harvard returned to an administration building
they occupied a year ago to renew their demands for faculty
diversity.
   The Harvard ``study-in'' was peaceful; about 125 students,
reading and talking quietly, filled a hallway in the main building.
   ``We've been getting a positive response,'' said Loretta
Martinez, 23, a second-year Harvard student and member of La
Alianza, a Hispanic students' organization. ``The message has
gotten across. There's more of a general awareness. But whether it
will be put into action remains to be seen.''
   At the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California,
Berkeley, about 75 students carried signs through halls reading
``This Is Not A White-only Club'' and ``Boycott Justice,''
prompting some professors to come out of their classrooms and
complain about the noise.
   Julie Derwinsky of the Coalition for a Diverse Faculty, based at
Berkeley, said the group mailed organizing materials about a month
ago to student organizations at several dozen schools.
   ``We hope that people realized that law students are concerned
about these issues, that we are all not conservative and hungry for
money,'' she said.
   She said she didn't know how many students participated in
Thursday's action.
   UCLA Law School communications director Ted Hulbert said about
100 students there attended a rally. A student claim that there
were only two minority faculty members was not correct, he said,
because three others are on the tenure track.
   University of California at Davis students scheduled a rally and
an afternoon boycott of classes. The 29-member faculty there has no
minority members.
   University spokesman David Ong said this is the first time in 15
years that there have been no minorities on the law school faculty.
One minority group member resigned unexpectedly last May; a second
turned down the university's offer, he said.
   In Austin, professors at the University of Texas Law School said
attendance Thursday was down between 20 percent and 25 percent, but
it wasn't clear how many students had cut class as part of the
protest.
   Texas Law School Dean Mark Yudof said the school has 54 tenured
or tenure-track faculty members. There are 46 men, two blacks, one
Asian-American, five women and no Hispanics.
   ``I think the students have called attention to a significant
problem at all American law schools,'' Yudof said.
   Kate Chesley, a spokeswoman at the University of Chicago Law
School, said about 20 students had congregated in a lounge and
discussed the situation as part of an ``Awareness Day.''
   At Harvard, students handed out fliers captioned ``Tenured
Hispanic Faculty'' depicting an empty picture frame. Dean James
Vorenberg, however, said the school has made ``great progress in
some areas of recruitment, particularly minorities and women.''
   In May, about 50 Harvard students, mostly black, held an
overnight vigil in Vorenberg's office and listed 12 demands. He
agreed to seven, including the establishment of a fellowship to
encourage blacks to teach there and a broader role for students in
finding prospective minority faculty members.
   Harvard Law School has 61 tenured faculty members; six are women
and three are blacks. There are two tenure-track professors who are
black.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreigners continue to own just under 1
percent of U.S. agricultural land, slightly more than a year ago,
the Agriculture Department reported Thursday.
   The department's Economic Research Service said its 1988
year-end review of reports under the decade-old Agricultural
Foreign Investment Disclosure Act found about 12.5 million acres in
foreign hands, 99,100 acres more than reported in 1987.
   Of the land owned by foreign interests, 48 percent was forest
land, 17 percent cropland, 30 percent pasture and other
agricultural land and 5 percent non-agricultural land.
   Corporations held 80 percent of the foreign-owned land, with the
balance held by individuals, partnerships, institutions and other
entities.
   Much of the ownership is concentrated in the United Kingdom,
Canada, France, West Germany, the Netherlands Antilles, the
Netherlands and Switzerland. Those countries combined to account
for about 60 percent of all foreign-held acreage.
   Maine continued to have the heaviest concentration of foreign
ownership, with holdings of almost 1.8 million acres, mostly
timberland, or more than 14 percent of the total owned by
foreigners.
   The report said that ``93 percent of the foreign-owned acreage
will remain in agricultural production, according to foreign
owners.''

<HEAD>Actor's Former Lover Takes Lie Detector Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lie detector test disproves claims by Rock
Hudson's estate that the late actor's homosexual lover had sex with
another man after filing a landmark AIDS lawsuit, an attorney
argued Thursday.
   Attorney Harold Rhoden said the test indicated his client, Marc
Christian, was being truthful when he denied having sex with
Gunther Fraulob, a singer and songwriter who came forward with
claims of an affair after a jury awarded Christian $21.75 million.
   An attorney for Hudson's estate, James Parker Mills, said
results of a lie detector test taken by Fraulob showed he too was
being truthful.
   Mills said Fraulob's test was taken before the estate filed
papers saying his evidence was relevant to the case.
   Mills, who had challenged Christian to take a similar test,
acknowledged that neither test was admissible in court and should
not be considered by Superior Court Judge Bruce Geernaert in
deciding whether to grant a new trial or to reduce the jury's award
to Christian, as requested by Hudson's estate.
   Both sides were in court Thursday for legal arguments on the
request. A hearing is scheduled for Friday.
   Jurors in February found that Hudson engaged in ``outrageous
conduct'' by concealing from Christian that he had AIDS. The
panelists, who had heard seven weeks of often lurid testimony about
the dead star's sex life, said Christian should receive $14.5
million in actual damages and $7.25 million in punitive damages.
   After the verdict, Fraulob of Laguna Niguel filed a sworn
statement claiming he had sex with Christian shortly after
Christian sued in November 1985. Christian contends he was so
traumatized that he has remained celibate since learning Hudson had
AIDS.
   The twist that made Christian's suit so unusual was that he did
not develop AIDS and has tested negative for the disease. In
previous lawsuits, only those who actually contracted a sexually
transmitted disease were able to win damages.
   Christian, 35, sued for emotional distress, saying he had lived
with the fear of coming down with the deadly disease since learning
in 1985 that the movie star had AIDS.
   Hudson, 58, died on Oct. 5, 1985, three months after the public
learned that he had the disease.

<HEAD>Bill Would Curb Amount of Commercials on TV Shows for Children</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in graf 11, bgng ``But Rep.''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Backers of a bill to curb the amount of
commercials shown on TV shows for children said Thursday that
broadcasters have stepped up the pitches on such programs since ad
limits were lifted five years ago.
   Kids are being exposed to as much as 42 percent more toy, cereal
and candy advertising per hour than adults, as advertisers target
``a particularly vulnerable audience,'' Rep. Edward Markey,
D-Mass., told a House hearing.
   An independent station in Boston is inserting as many as 14
minutes of commericals into each hour of kids' shows, compared with
an average eight minutes for adult network programs, Markey told
the House Energy and Commerce telecommunications and finance
subcommittee that he chairs.
   ``We have a duty to see to it that this child audience is
protected from wave after wave of exploitive commercials,'' he said.
   Prior to 1984, when the Federal Communications Commission lifted
commercial limits on kids' TV shows, the amount of ads on network
children's programs was at or below the 9{ minute-per-hour rules
that the FCC had established in 1974, Markey said.
   Since 1984, ``commercial time has been on the rise, with
stations at two of the networks now offering as many as 11 minutes
per hour of commercial matter,'' he said.
   Markey said the government must stem ``endless streams'' of TV
commercials on children's shows because broadcasters are not
regulating themselves.
   But Glenn Wright, speaking for the National Association of
Broadcasters, said an NAB survey found children's programs
contained an average of about 8{ minutes of commerical time per
hour.
   He said that ``there does not appear to be a deluge of
commercials raining down upon the viewers of children's
programming.''
   Wright also said program-length commercials made by advertisers
have not done well. ``The child audience has made distinctions
between program content and commercial content and on its own has
avoided a deluge of commercials,'' he said.
   But Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., said it was ``naive'' to think
the marketplace would regulate itself. He said money drives the
television business and that ``about 80 percent of network
programming is unmitigated crap.''
   Slattery said the networks weren't meeting their
responsibilities to children and the government should ``put as
much pressure as possible'' on them.
   Slattery said the bill will not affect responsible broadcasters
``one iota.''
   The bill would impose a limit of 10{ minutes of advertising per
hour on weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays for kid's
shows. The legislation, written in cooperation with NAB and the
Association of Independent Television Stations, also would require
the FCC at license-renewal time to consider how well a broadcaster
has been committed to educational and informational needs of
children in its overall programming.
   Congress passed an identical bill last year but then-President
Reagan vetoed it on constitutional grounds.
   DeWitt Helm, president of the Association of National
Advertisers, told the subcommittee he also thought the measure was
unconstitutional and that less advertising might mean lower-quality
shows.
   ``Program producers must have the flexibility to determine how
best to balance the entertainment needs of the audience with the
financial requirements of good programming,'' Helm said.

<HEAD>FTC Judge Finds Kraft Unintentionally Made False Claims for Cheese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kraft Inc. unintentionally advertised falsely
that its Kraft Singles cheese slices contain as much calcium as
five ounces of milk and more than imitation cheese, according to a
ruling of a Federal Trade Commission administrative law judge
released Thursday.
   Kraft said it did not believe the ads were misleading and would
appeal the ruling to the full commission.
   One of the challenged ads said: ``Imitation slices use hardly
any milk. But Kraft has five ounces per slice. So her little bones
get calcium they need to grow.''
   The judge, Lewis F. Parker, said the ad implied that the slice
contained as much calcium as five ounces of milk and did not
mention that 30 percent of the calcium in the milk is lost in
processing.
   Also, he said, the ads can be taken as implying ``that imitation
slices which, they state, use hardly any milk, contain less calcium
than Kraft Singles.''
   In fact, almost all imitation and non-dairy cheese contains just
as much calcium as the real thing, he said.
   However, Kraft ``did not intend to make'' misrepresentations and
it was ``debatable'' whether the company should have known that
false claims could be inferred from the ads, he said.
   ``The advertisements ... were developed by Kraft in response to
the success of non-dairy imitation and substitute cheese slices,
and were not intended to convey express deceptive claims.''
   He ordered the company not to misrepresent the nutritional
content of its cheese slices in the future.
   In Glenview, Ill., company spokesman Gene Stevenson said Kraft
was pleased that the judge recognized ``there was no intent on the
part of Kraft to mislead the public.''
   ``Copy testing that we've done demonstrates that consumers do
not receive the implied message'' as stated in Parker's ruling,
Stevenson said.
   Kraft is ``confident that the integrity of the advertising will
be upheld'' by the commission, he said.
   Bruce Silverglade, attorney for Science in the Public Interest,
the advocacy group which asked the commission to look into the
matter in 1985, said he was pleased with the decision.
   ``It may represent a reawakening of the federal government to
problems of misleading health claims in food advertising,'' he said.

   Canadian environmentalists expressed concern
Thursday over the Alaskan oil spill despite repeated predictions
from top government officials that it won't reach the British
Columbia coast.
   ``Even if it doesn't reach our shores, our wildlife that we
share with Alaska already is affected greatly,'' oceanographer
Silvaine Zimmermann of the activist group Greenpeace said in a
phone interview from Vancouver, British Columbia.
   Leading environmental groups also say that even if the oil from
the largest spill ever in the United States or Canada doesn't reach
British Columbia this time, the Exxon Valdez incident illustrates
that an accident closer to home is inevitable.
   The spill, which has prompted parliamentary debate in Ottawa, is
about 650 miles from Canadian waters and doesn't threaten to change
course toward the south, according to the federal fisheries,
environment and transportation ministers.
   Fisheries Minister Tom Siddon returned to the lobby of
Parliament on Wednesday with a map of Alaska and his account that
the spill won't affect Canada.
   However, James Fulton, who represents in the House of Commons
British Columbia's northwestern Skeena district closest to the
spill, said his information was that the slick is only about 250
miles away.
   That information ``is clear beyond a reasonable doubt,'' Fulton
said during the emergency debate he requested Tuesday night. He is
the environment critic for the socialist New Democratic Party, the
third largest national party in Canada.
   Fulton said Canada must be prepared to handle the spill if the
winds should change. He called it a ``monster now starting to come
out of (the) sound, and with pieces breaking off.''
   ``If the wind changes direction and picks up, parts of the slick
will reach British Columbia. We can always hope that the wind
doesn't blow,'' he said.
   The presence of supertankers in the sea lanes off of British
Columbia has been a longtime subject of debate in Canada.
   Ms. Zimmermann said some people consider the possibility of an
eventual disaster off of the Canadian coast as a mathematical
certainty, not a statistical probability.
   She said that the wildlife shared with Alaska includes the
parent stocks of sea mammals such as sea otters. She also expressed
concern about the gray whales that are migrating north from their
winter zones off of Mexico's Baja California coast.
   The opposition Liberal Party also supported the New Democrats'
call during the parliamentary debate for a federal inquiry into the
safety of coastal tanker shipping.
   Parliament returned to session this week after a three-month
recess following the election last fall of a second consecutive
majority government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive
Conservative Party.

<HEAD>INS Plan Would Allow Swift Denials of Political Asylum Applications</HEAD>

   The Justice Department is studying a proposal
that would allow authorities to summarily exclude aliens seeking
political asylum without giving them a hearing before an
immigration judge, officials said Thursday.
   Under a plan drafted by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, specially trained INS hearing officers would conduct
informal proceedings to consider an alien's claim for asylum status.
   One critic of the proposal said it would ``obliterate fairness
and due process'' for asylum seekers that is now provided by
immigration law.
   The proposal, which is still under study, would ``provide for
summary exclusion of aliens who seek asylum at ports of entry who
fail to make a credible showing'' of eligibility, according to an
internal Justice Department analysis of the plan.
   ``This should discourage those who are claiming asylum, but in
fact have no legitimate right to this status, from attempting to
enter the United States under this claim,'' according to the
document.
   People seeking asylum must demonstrate a ``well-founded fear of
persecution'' for a variety of factors, including ethnic background
and political or religious beliefs.
   The proposal to amend current immigration law would require
approval by Congress.
   It was drafted by INS in the wake of the flood of Central
Americans crossing the border from Mexico into Texas over the last
10 months.
   Most were denied political asylum on the ground that they were
fleeing poverty, not political persecution.
   Gregory J. Leo, director of legislative affairs for INS, said
the proposal was in an ``early stage of review.''
   He described the plan as a ``legislative proposal that has been
generated at a staff level'' and circulated to various divisions of
the Justice Department, including the office of Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh.
   It was drafted as a possible solution to the ``misuse or abuse
of the asylum process'' by Central Americans who come to the border
without a legal claim for political asylum status, Leo said.
   ``The present system allows an alien to make successive
applications to the district (INS) director and to an immigration
judge, leading to a time-consuming process,'' the department's
analysis said.
   An adverse ruling by the immigration judge can be appealed to
the Board of Immigration Appeals and thence to federal circuit
courts of appeal _ a process that could extend an alien's stay for
many months.
   The draft proposal would eliminate the hearing mechanism for
aliens at ports of entry who are denied political asylum.
   ``There are people who would use the asylum process as a means
of staying here even though they are not qualified,'' Leo said.
   But Arthur C. Helton, director of the political asylum project
of the non-profit Lawyers Committee for Human Rights, said the plan
would ``obliterate fairness and due process for most asylum
seekers.''
   ``This would be a very serious attack on asylum'' as a means of
entering the country, he said.
   ``It would affect thousands of people arriving at the border,''
Helton said.
   In the 1988 fiscal year, 60,000 people sought asylum and if
current rates continue the total for the current year will be more
than 100,000, Helton said.
   The draft legislation also contains a provision that would
increase by 5,000 the number of refugee visas that would be granted
in the 1989 fiscal year for aliens from Central American nations.
   Anyone seeking refugee status must apply in their own country.
By increasing the number of visas by 5,000 authorities hope to
encourage Central Americans to apply at U.S. embassies in their
home countries, according to the draft.
   INS is currently authorized to admit 3,500 eligible refugees
from Central America in the current fiscal year.
   The INS proposal would abolish the right of aliens pressing
claims at immigration-court hearings to be represented by an
attorney. When an alien is examined by an INS officer, an attorney
could act as an adviser but could not be an advocate, presenting
evidence.
   ``The officer's determination would be administratively final''
but could be overruled by the attorney general or the INS
commissioner, the proposal said.
   The influx of refugees from Central America across the Texas
border over the last 10 months prompted INS to set up a detention
facility for people awaiting immigration court hearings.
   On Wednesday, 2,150 refugees were being detained at the INS
facility in Port Isabel, Texas. A total of 4,340 refugees were
being detained at various INS locations in Texas, the agency said.
   Aliens denied political aslyum are given the choice of returning
to Mexico of facing detention while they await the outcome of
immigration court proceedings.
   The crisis stemmed from an upsurge in asylum applications at the
border crossing from the normal monthly total of about 400 to 5,000
a month between June 1988 and Feb. 1.
   The flow was reduced after INS imposed emergency procedures,
enabling one-day processing of asylum applications at Port Isabel.
   The proposal would also eliminate the right to apply for
political asylum at any point during a deportation proceeding.
Aliens would be required to file a notice of intent to file such an
application two weeks after the start of deportation proceedings.
   The applicant would then have another 30 days to file the papers.
   If the deadlines were missed, a political asylum claim would be
allowed only if the alien showed ``changed circumstances'' in his
home country would make him qualified.

<HEAD>Administration Moves to Widen Immigration Gate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration moved Thursday to
widen America's gate for the unexpected flood of Jews, Armenians
and Pentecostals allowed to emigrate from the Soviet Union, but it
still faced stiff criticism for the bureaucratic barriers which
have thwarted that exodus so far.
   State Department officials formally notified Congress that
President Bush intends to raise, from 25,000 to 43,500, the refugee
admissions ceiling this year for applicants from the Soviet Union.
Moreover, they advanced legislation to create a new ``special
immigrant'' category to accommodate up to 30,000 additional
applicants.
   But those initiatives didn't spare the administration from being
lambasted on Capitol Hill, where several lawmakers charged that
U.S. footdragging on the refugee issue remains a major
embarrassment to a nation which, after all, has fought for years to
convince Moscow to loosen its emigration policy.
   Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on immigration, said the slow pace in which
applications have been handled, and in many cases denied, runs the
risk of destroying ``a tremendous victory for bipartisan foreign
policy ... In short, let's not blow it.''
   Morrison and several other members of Congress already had
fashioned alternative legislative measures designed to speed entry
into the United States by the nearly 8,000 Soviet citizens, half of
them Jews, seeking refugee visas each month. Bush's
counter-proposals were served up just as the panel began hearings
on those measures.
   Meanwhile, another panel, the House Appropriations subcommittee
on foreign operations, approved the administration's request for
$100 million in supplemental money this year to help pay for the
increase in refugee processing.
   At Morrison's hearing, Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., noted that at
one point after Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev eased emigration
restrictions in late 1987, the U.S. Embassy in Moscow only had one
person assigned to handle the refugee applications. ``And the State
Department told us that was the consequence of appropriations
constraints,'' Frank snapped. ``It was one of the three silliest
things the State Department has ever said, strong competition
notwithstanding.''
   According to the Council of Jewish Federations, more than 7,000
Jews are stalled in Vienna and Rome, awaiting processing by the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Thousands of others, still
in the Soviet Union, have been told it could take as long as two
years to get an initial screening interview at the U.S. Embassy in
Moscow, the council says.
   Despite Frank's persistent questioning, Jonathan Moore, U.S.
coordinator for refugee affairs, declined to say whether the
consular and immigration staffs in Moscow would be substantially
beefed up, noting there are mutual limits on the size of each
country's missions. But he suggested part of the problem in Moscow
may be eased by forwarding some of the paperwork to other U.S.
offices for completion.
   The last major Soviet emigration to the United States occurred
nearly 10 years ago, when 28,400 people came as refugees. For the
next seven years, relatively few Soviets were permitted to
emigrate, but it remained a matter of U.S. policy to grant
automatic refugee status to any Soviet citizen who got out and
asked entry into America.
   Following Gorbachev's policy change, more than 20,400 Soviet
refugees were admitted to the United States last fiscal year, an
almost sixfold increase over the 1987 figure and a tide that caught
U.S. officials off guard. To the dismay of many refugee groups and
members of Congress, the INS then switched gears and began denying,
on a case-by-case basis, refugee visas to a substantial number of
applicants. Such denials are based on findings that the applicant
has not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution.
   The General Accounting Office said Thursday that a total of
4,919 Soviets had been denied refugee status from October 1988
through March 31. In that period, 11,783 people were approved in
Vienna and Rome, while 2,073 were denied at those embassies.
Meanwhile, 13,568 were approved at the Moscow embassy, and 4,919
were denied there.
   Virtually all of the Jews and Pentecostals leaving the Soviet
Union are doing so with Israeli visas. But instead of going on to
Israel, the vast majority _ about 95 percent _ stop in Vienna or
Rome to apply for U.S. visas. Armenian emigres, on the other hand,
constitute most of the refugee applicants applying directly at the
U.S. Embassy in Moscow.
   Bush's latest proposal would create a new, discretionary
category of ``special immigrants'' as selected from time to time by
the president. They could become citizens, and would have other
rights and benefits shared by refugees.
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., said the ``special immigrant''
idea ``certainly does not address the long-term difficulties of
increased immigration of refugees from the Soviet Union.''
   INS Commissioner Alan C. Nelson insisted ``our Soviet program is
still one of the most generous of all immigration programs.'' And
``We wish to make it clear that absolutely no Soviet seeking relief
is forced to return to the Soviet Union.''

<HEAD>Sanctions Against Panama Extended 1 Year by Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush extended economic sanctions
against Panama for one year on Thursday, calling the government of
military leader Manuel Antonio Noriega ``corrupt, repressive and
inept.''
   In an executive order, Bush said that the ``actions and policies
of the (Noriega) regime in Panama continue to pose an unusual and
extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of
the United States.''
   Sanctions put in place by the Reagan administration were to
expire on Saturday. Bush notified Congress he was retaining them
for an additional year.
   However, the sanctions could be modified depending on the
outcome of Panama's May 7 presidential election. ``After the
election, we'll take a look at the situation there and see if
there's any cause for change,'' said an administration official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``If the Panamanian people have a chance to express their will
in a free and open manner, we're confident Noriega will go,'' said
the official. However, he conceced that prospects for a fair
election were uncertain in that Noriega appears likely to control
the process.
   The sanctions include sharp restrictions on U.S. companies that
do business in Panama, a hold on assets of the Panamanian
government in the United State and a prohibitation on tax payments
by U.S. organizations to the Noriega regime.
   ``The objective of administration policy remains support for a
return to civilian constitutional rule and the development of an
apolitical military establishment in Panama,'' Bush told Congress.
   ``Our judgment remains that the root cause of the current crisis
is the fact that the Panamanian people have lost confidence in a
political system widely perceived as corrupt, repressive and
inept.''
   Bush said he would keep the sanctions in place ``as long as
these measures are appropriate.'' They will automatically expire
April 8, 1990, unless he renews them again.
   Noriega, who is accused in a federal drug-running case in Miami,
has been the de facto ruler of Panama since February 1988, when he
orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.
   Delvalle had tried to fire Noriega as military leader after
Noriega was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug-trafficking charges.
Noriega denied the charges. Washington continues to recognize
Delvalle as president and imposed the sanctions against Panama in
an effort to force Noriega out.
   The Reagan administration cut off military and economic aid to
Panama in July 1987.
   The administration has amended the sanctions to permit U.S.
businesses with subsidiaries in Panama to pay amounts owed to the
government of Panama _ including taxes withheld from paychecks of
workers in Panama _ into escrow accounts in U.S. banks.
   Bush's message to Congress said that 170 U.S. companies with
subsidiaries in Panama are being notified by letter of these
changes.
   ``Information received from Panama indicates that certain U.S.
firms with operations in Panama may have faiiled to withhold
Panamanian taxes from employee paychecks in possible violation of
the regulations,'' Bush's statement said.

   Savings and loan customers withdrew $9.4
billion from their accounts in February, down only slightly from a
record $10.6 billion in January, the government said Thursday.
   The $20 billion withdrawn during the first two months of this
year is more than double the $8.6 billion for all of last year and
puts new pressure on Congress to move swiftly as it begins writing
legislation to close or merge failed S&amp;Ls.
   James Barth, chief economist of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, attributed the outflow to the failure of S&amp;Ls to keep pace
with rising interest rates offered by competitors, chiefly money
market mutual funds.
   But, in recent weeks, top administration officials, including
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, has been citing the outflow
as evidence of public nervousness that will persist until Congress
adopts President Bush's proposal to spend $50 billion over the next
three years to bail out the industry.
   February marks the 10th straight month of net withdrawals and
the fourth month of withdrawals in excess of $7 billion. Earlier,
from October 1987 though May of last year, billions of dollars
flowed into S&amp;Ls as stock market investors sought the safety of
federally insured accounts.
   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,
said S&amp;Ls, as a substitute for deposits, were turning increasingly
toward advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, a trend he called
disturbing.
   Although the 12 regional banks are controlled by the industry,
they borrow in financial markets and relend to S&amp;Ls at low
government-subsidized rates. Advances from the system have
increased by $15.8 billion from October to February.
   ``It disturbs me that the banks are being looked to so heavily
by the thrifts. It represents more and more of a growing government
involvement in the entire industry,'' Ely said.

<HEAD>FEC Warns that Presidential Election Fund Running Dry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission warned
Congress Thursday that the fund used to finance presidential
elections is running dry because Americans are less inclined to
earmark $1 of their tax payment for it.
   ``Unless the system is modified, by 1996 the fund will lack
sufficient monies to finance the presidential elections,'' FEC
chairman Danny McDonald said in a letter to the House and Senate
Appropriations committees.
   Meanwhile, two Democratic lawmakers introduced legislation that
would require candidates who are eligible to receive public funds
in the general election campaign to agree in writing to participate
in at least four 90-minute debates. The vice presidential nominees
would be required to engage in at least one debate.
   ``If presidential candidates are going to continue to take $100
million from taxpayers to run their campaigns, then there ought to
be some assurance that they will stand up on stage, face their
opponent and engage in a true discussion of the issues,'' said Rep.
Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., who introduced the legislation with Sen.
Bob Graham, D-Fla.
   Under the proposal, the debates would be sponsored by
non-partisan organizations and held in September and October. At
least 30 minutes of each 90-minute debate would be devoted to
questions and answers or candidate-to-candidate exchanges.
   The Federal Election Commission would determine whether
candidates are responsible for failing to comply.
   Taxpayer contributions, which come from checking a $1
contribution box on tax returns, have been declining because,
according to Markey, ``each year fewer and fewer think they're
getting their dollar's worth.''
   The percentage of taxpayers contributing to the Presidential
Election Campaign Fund has dropped steadily from 28.7 percent in
1981 to 21 percent in 1988, according to the ongressional Research
Service.
   Once overflowing, the campaign fund is falling victim to
inflation as well as a dropoff in income.
   FEC spokesman Fred Eiland said the peak year was $41 million
earmarked on returns filed in 1981. On returns filed last year,
only $33 million was earmarked for the election fund.
   The fund is the source for the matching contributions the FEC
allocates to candidates for the major party nominations as well as
the lump sum payments made to the nominees for the general
elections campaign.
   In 1988, Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis
received federal checks for $46.1 million each for their fall
campaigns. In addition, each party received $9.2 million.
   The FEC also paid out a total of $66.7 million in matching
funds. The commission matches up to $250 in individual
contributions to qualified presidential candidates during the
primary campaign.
   Republican Pat Robertson received $10.1 million in matching
funds, the largest amount of any presidential candidate. Dukakis
was second with $9 million and Bush third with $8.4 million.
   The fund paid out a total of $177 million in 1988. The first
year it operated was 1976 when $70 million was distributed to
candidates.
   Eiland said the fund is expected to have enough money to cover
the 1992 election assuming President Bush has no serious opposition
for the GOP nomination.

<HEAD>Police Report Cites Danger of Guerrilla War In Kosovo Province</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal police report quoted in
the official press on Thursday expressed concern that some ethnic
Albanians could stage guerrilla warfare against federal authorities
in troubled Kosovo province.
   Bloody clashes between ethnic Albanians and security forces left
at least 24 people dead in Kosovo last week, including two
policemen, and 200 injured.
   Ethnic Albanians, who comprise about 85 percent of Kosovo's
population, took to the streets to protest constitutional changes
which they say limit the province's autonomy.
   The changes took effect March 28 and gave Yugoslavia's largest
republic of Serbia more control over Kosovo's judiciary, schools
and police.
   Some ethnic Albanians ``announced they would flee into the
woods'' which indicates Yugoslavia is faced with ``a danger of
separatist guerrilla warfare,'' the state-run Borba daily quoted
the police report as saying.
   According to the report, about 45,000 ethnic Albanians took part
in last week's riots in Kosovo. A state of emergency and curfews
were introduced there in a crackdown against the protests.
   Borba quoted a police officer as saying 16 major fires hit
forests and factories in the province since April 1, and described
the fires as ``terrorist diversions'' by ethnic Albanian
nationalists.
   The Vecernje Novosti newspaper said a major highway leading from
the provincial capital of Pristina to Urosevac was closed for more
than two hours Wednesday because ``unknown people tried to plant
explosives on the road.''
   A Kosovo police statement meanwhile confirmed unofficial reports
that two ethnic Albanian boys were killed on Wednesday.
   It said they were shot by another ethnic Albanian youth playing
with a rifle said to belong to a soldier guarding a military
observation post.
   The statement gave no other details. The incident reportedly
occurred in Malisevo village, about 25 miles southwest of Pristina.
   On the political front, media reports said Thursday that Serbia
rejected a public call for introducing democratic elections with
competing candidates and proposed its Communist Party chief,
Slobodan Milosevic, for the office of the republic's president.
   Serbia's Socialist Alliance, a Communist-run umbrella
organization, on Wednesday turned down a proposal that Milosevic,
the sole official candidate for president, be elected by public
ballot.
   Slovenia, Yugoslavia's most liberal republic, held its first
Western-style general elections last Sunday, featuring two
candidates and a secret ballot for its representative on the
country's collective presidency.
   Janez Drnovsek, a 38-year-old economist advocating closer ties
with the West, a market economy and cuts in the military budget,
was elected by 56 percent of the votes cast.
   He is to be inaugurated as Yugoslavia's next president on May
15, under the country's rotating system in which presidency members
take turns every year at the head of the state presidency.
   Slovenia has led the drive for more democracy in this
Communist-ruled state, and has allowed several non-communist, human
rights and political groups to function freely.
   Serbia, led by hardliner Milosevic, insists on the one-party
system as the main solution to the country's problems.
   ``We will choose (Milosevic) according to valid constitutional
norms,'' said Bogdan Trifunovic, head of the Serbian Socialist
Alliance, according to the Borba newspaper.
   Under the Yugoslav system, the Socialist Alliance in each of the
country's six republics and two provinces is in charge of
nominating candidates for government posts.

<HEAD>Developer of Home AIDS-Test Kits Tells FDA They're Safe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration was told
Thursday that home AIDS-test kits are safe and could save thousands
of lives, but the agency questioned whether the test manufacturers
could provide adequate counseling and privacy.
   At a daylong hearing at the National Institutes of Health, the
developer of an AIDS home-testing kit that failed to win FDA
approval criticized the agency's decision, saying it was the result
of politics, not scientific judgment.
   ``Untold thousands have become infected (with the AIDS virus)
simply because there's no AIDS home test available,'' said Elliott
J. Millenson, a Rockville, Md., consultant who formed a company to
develop and sell a blood-collection kit.
   ``So long as politics _ not science _ guides government action
on AIDS, people will die needlessly,'' he said.
   The FDA has been reluctant to approve AIDS home-testing kits
because of concern over whether people can safely draw their own
blood and ship samples safely to a lab for testing and whether the
samples can remain viable during shipping. They also are concerned
about whether testers can assure confidentiality and whether test
suppliers can provide adequate counseling, especially for those who
test positive for the deadly virus.
   The agency last year rejected Millenson's proposed home-testing
kit and said it would consider for approval only tests designed for
use by medical professionals in traditional health care settings.
   Paul Parkman, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics
Evaluation and Research, who conducted the hearing, said the agency
will continue to consider evidence on the home-testing issue, but
added, ``I don't see there's been a lot of change'' since the FDA's
decision a year ago.
   Millenson said the FDA ``has refused to study the evidence''
that backs up his claim that the test his company developed is
safe, effective and would incorporate adequate education and
counseling of those using it.
   Millenson's home-testing kit included a device for drawing
blood, a crush-proof shipping container for blood samples and a
detailed instruction booklet. Users would draw their own blood,
send the sample in a pre-paid shipping envelope to a laboratory and
be informed of the results by telephone by trained health-care
professionals, he said.
   Howard Markman, a Denver psychologist who was a consultant for
Millenson's project, dismissed the FDA's fears that telephone
counseling for those who test positive for the lethal virus will
not be adequate. He said studies have shown that telephone
counseling has effects comparable to face-to-face counseling.
   Markman criticized the FDA's resistance to home testing for AIDS
and said the agency appears to be saying that ``if this is out of
the hands of the medical community, that's not good.''
   ``It makes me wonder whether there's a turf issue that's a
hidden agenda,'' he said.

   Tamil militants on Thursday blew up a
truck carrying Indian troops in northern Sri Lanka, killing at
least 18 of them, military officials said. Six more soldiers were
killed later in a gunbattle with the fleeing guerrillas, residents
said.
   Militants using remote controlled devices detonated explosives
buried in the road as the truck passed over it at Mankulam village,
26 miles north of Vavuniya town, military officials said. At least
five soldiers were injured, they said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   An official of the Indian High Commission, or embassy, in
Colombo said he was unaware of the killings.
   Indian troops, searching for the guerrillas, were ambushed by
the militants and six soldiers were killed in the ensuing gunbattle
at the nearby Maharambakulam village, said residents in Vavuniya
town, 135 miles north of Colombo.
   The residents, who were contacted by telephone, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The militants, believed to be members of the dominant Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam group, took away 15 rifles and a light
machine gun after blowing up the truck, officials said.
   India deployed nearly 50,000 troops after Tamil militants
spurned an India-sponsored peace accord signed in July 1987 and
aimed at ending a Tamil insurgency in the northern and eastern
provinces.
   At least 800 Indian soldiers have been killed in the operations
against the rebels, who refused to surrender their arms, saying the
accord did not meet enough of their demands for self rule.
   India sponsored the accord because of the sympathies of its own
60 million Tamils to the rebel cause.
   The 6-year-old Tamil secessionist war and a violent Sinhalese
backlash have claimed more than 12,500 lives.
   The latest violence came barely 24 hours after the government
announced a unilateral one-week cease-fire, beginning Tuesday.
   Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said Wednesday: ``It (the
cease-fire) will be a unilateral declaration by the government and
will cover military operations by both Sri Lanka and Indian armies
against Sinhalese and Tamil terrorists.''
   The government on Thursday also released 13 political prisoners
as part of a peace proposal offered to Tamils and Sinhalese
militants.
   After receiving a pardon from President Ranasinghe Premadasa,
the prisoners walked out of a maximum-security prison, about three
miles east of Colombo.
   The prisoners were Tamils convicted under anti-terrorist laws
and serving sentences ranging from five to 15 years, said
Velupillai Balakumar, the president of the Eelam Revolutionary
Organization, a Tamil group.
   Last week, Premadasa offered Tamil and Sinhalese militants
unconditional amnesty, seats in Parliament and money for
surrendered weapons if they stopped fighting.
   Neither Sinhalese militants nor the Tamil rebels have responded
positively to the peace overtures.
   On Wednesday, Sinhalese militants called a nationwide strike to
commemorate a failed uprising against the government 18 years ago.
The strike was viewed as a rejection of the peace offer.
   Meanwhile, two opposition leaders said the cease-fire
announcement would not be fruitful unless the government held
negotiations with extremist leaders.
   Sinhalese militants started the current campaign to bring down
the government after the July 1987 peace accord was signed, saying
it gave too many concessions to the minority community.
   The predominantly Hindu Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Sinhalese Buddhists make up 75 percent
and control the government and the military.
   Tamil militants allege their community is discriminated against
by the Sinhalese in jobs and education.

   A U.S. Army truck carrying three
unarmed Hawk missiles crashed into a house on Thursday when the
vehicle's brakes failed, but no one was hurt, a military spokesman
said.
   Maj. David Hartman, spokesman for the 32nd Army Air Defense
Command in Darmstadt, said the crash occurred outside the rural
town of Weilerbach, about 55 miles southwest of Frankfurt, as the
truck was returning from a field exercise.
   He said the missiles were undamaged and the missile transporter,
a lengthened model of a 2{-ton truck, was towed to its home base
near Kaiserslautern.
   Hawks are ground-to-air rockets designed to carry a conventional
high-explosive warhead.
   The accident could set off new protests from West German peace
activists who complain that some ground and air maneuvers by NATO
forces based in West Germany put civilian lives at risk.

   Sikh extremists burst into a farmhouse in
Punjab state and riddled the Sikh farmer and four members of his
family with automatic weapons fire as they slept, police reported
Thursday.
   News reports said five other people were killed in separate
incidents by Sikhs waging a terror campaign for an independent
nation in the northern agricultural region, the only Indian state
where the sect is in the majority.
   Ten gunmen entered the farmhouse in Kalchian village, 25 miles
from Amritsar, Wednesday night and opened fire with assault rifles,
said G.S. Mann, a senior police officer in the district.
   He identified those killed as 30-year-old Buta Singh; his father
Joginder Singh, 60; mother Charan Kaur, 55; brother Jarnail Singh,
32, and nephew Natha Singh, 26. He said Joginder Singh's
mother-in-law, Dalwant Kaur, was seriously wounded.
   ``The walls of the room were blood-splattered and the bodies lay
in pools of blood,'' Mann said.
   Most victims of the terrorists are Hindus, but they sometimes
kill Sikhs who do not support their cause.
   Buta Singh was among Sikhs detained in the June 1984 army raid
on Amritsar's Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of Sikhism, United
News of India reported. It said he was released with 137 others in
September 1988.
   The agency said Sikh extremists shot a village headman dead in
the Jalandhar district, 45 miles south of Amritsar, late Wednesday
and later hanged a Hindu priest in a nearby village.
   Another person was hanged Wednesday near Amritsar, bringing to
14 the number killed in that manner since two Sikhs were executed
by hanging Jan. 6 for the assassination of Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi in October 1984.
   She had ordered the raid on the Golden Temple with the purpose
of flushing out extremists who had turned the shrine into a
fortress. At least 1,200 people were killed in the raid.
   Militants began fighting for an independent Sikh homeland in
1982 and the violence has increased every year since. At least 510
people have been killed so far this year in Punjab and neighboring
Haryana state.
   Sikhs, whose faith is rooted in Hinduism and Islam, are only 2
percent of India's 880 million people, although they have a
majority in Punjab. They claim discrimination by Hindus, who make
up 90 percent of the population.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union confirmed Thursday that it
delivered fighter-bombers to Libya last month, but said they were
defensive aircraft and did not have the range to threaten Israel.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the total
was ``around half a dozen,'' not 12 to 15 as claimed by U.S.
officials.
   The issue appeared to cast a shadow over the otherwise warm,
constructive tone of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's talks with
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   With Washington reports of the bomber sale capturing headlines
in Britain, Mrs. Thatcher asked Gorbachev for an explanation and
got none, her spokesman said.
   Her foreign secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, also raised the matter
with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, and Shevardnadze
responded by mentioning British arms sales to Saudi Arabia.
   Howe said his government was concerned because Libya is a
terrorist state, said the British spokesman, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Gerasimov told a news conference he did not know about the sale,
but later went on television to confirm elements of the report
while seeking to minimize its significance.
   U.S. Defense Department sources have said the aircraft are SU-24
Fencers, which can fly within an 800-mile radius without refueling,
far enough to reach Egypt and even Israel from existing Libyan
airfields. They say the jets were shipped in crated pieces to the
Libyans aboard Soviet transport planes.
   In interviews on Channel 4 News and BBC-TV, Gerasimov said the
planes, whose type he did not specify, were supplied to Libya under
a 1986 agreement. He said it was ``an old contract,'' not more than
six were sold and they were shipped in pieces.
   ``This is not a long-range bomber,'' Gerasimov said. ``This is a
bomber that you can use for closer activities. Its operational
range is 300 miles.
   ``It's a front-line bomber,'' he added. ``It's for defense only.
You cannot really use it for offensive purposes.''
   The interviewer said the planes could refuel in midair and reach
Israel, to which Gerasimov replied: ``Theoretically maybe, but
Libya has no refueling capacity at all.''
   The sale comes at a time when the Soviet Union is trying to
improve relations with Israel as part of its effort to play a
greater role in Middle East peace efforts.
   Israel condemned the sale. ``We are surprised that the Soviet
Union, which states that it seeks to relieve situations of
confrontations around the world ... is supplying offensive
weaponry'' to Libya, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said, on
condition of anonymity.
   ``This will not add to stability in the Middle East,'' said
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   On BBC television, Gerasimov said the planes were delivered in
March and suggested they would not be operational for some time
because they were delivered ``in crates. ... You must put them
together. It takes time and know-how to do it.''
   He said the sale to Libya ``is really small fry'' campared with
the British contract to sell Saudi Arabia billions of dollars worth
of Tornado fighter-bombers.

<HEAD>Vets Who Built Clinic For Former Enemy Return To Happy Greetings</HEAD>

   A group of Vietnam veterans flew home from
Southeast Asia to a greeting of confetti, hugs and kisses Thursday
after building a 14-room clinic for their former enemies with
$50,000 in donated money.
   ``Boy, we didn't get a greeting like this when we came back from
the war,'' said Army veteran Steve Brooks of Santa Cruz, among the
six volunteers who returned to San Francisco International Airport
after nearly four months in Vietnam.
   The veterans, along with about 30 Vietnamese they paid $1 a day
each, erected a one-story, 2,500-square-foot building at Vung Tau,
some 60 miles from Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon.
   The veterans said they watched with pride Saturday while local
politicians made speeches under U.S. and Vietnamese flags in a
champagne-toasted ceremony to mark the finish of the project.
   The unusual mission left Richard Anderson feeling much better
about himself than he did after serving a year in Vietnam with the
Army Corps of Engineers.
   Anderson, 41, was the job foreman on what he and his buddies
called the ``Veterans Vietnam Restoration Project,'' an idea that
originated with a Veterans of Foreign Wars contingent at
Garberville, Calif.
   ``It was,'' he said, ``out of a sense of purpose, to do
something kind for the Vietnamese people,'' he said, but not
because he felt he had hurt them in the war.
   ``I don't lay that personal guilt on myself,'' Anderson
declared. ``But I have problems secondary to that. There was
something about the Vietnamese people I had to do.''
   Anderson said he didn't have to come home from the war to
conclude, as he did, that there was something wrong with U.S.
involvement in Vietnam.
   ``In my first three months in Vietnam I noticed it was a crazy
war and it was wrong and that some day we would have to make up for
it,'' he said.
   The volunteers, who had collected $50,000 in a funding drive
that began last year, were given housing by the Vietnamese
government, Anderson said. But they had to buy their own food and
other necessities.
   They ran into some surprises in building their clinic. Instead
of using concrete blocks they had to use small locally made bricks.
The basic design, which called for a 1,500-square-foot building,
was changed to 2,500 square feet at the insistence of local
politicians.
   And every day, Anderson said, he had to deal with local
officials who had to approve of everything that was to be done.
   ``We brought some tools and experience, but we didn't realize we
couldn't get power to the job site,'' he said. ``We didn't realize
water was rationed so we couldn't mix materials. We didn't realize
everything had to be done by hand.''

   Rain and thunderstorms were scattered over the East Coast on
Thursday, while record heat returned to the Southwest with
temperatures above 100 degrees.
   An upper air disturbance moving through the middle Atlantic
Coast scattered showers and thunderstorms over eastern North
Carolina and Virginia.
   A thunderstorm at Cape Carteret, N.C., produced hail as big as
dimes and strong gusty wind. Dime-size hail also fell from a
thunderstorm in Onslow County, N.C.
   Thunderstorm wind gusts toppled trees and power lines at Castle
Hayne, N.C., with wind gusting to 53 mph at Wilmington, N.C.
   Rain combined with snowmelt over northern New England to swell
rivers and streams. An ice jam on the Connecticut River flooded a
highway in New Hampshire between Lancaster and Cushman, the
National Weather Service said.
   Flooding caused by rain and snowmelt also continued along the
Red River Valley along the border between North Dakota and
Minnesota. The Red River was 10 feet above flood stage at Fargo,
N.D., and was expected to crest nearly 20 feet above flood stage
Sunday or Monday.
   More flooding persisted in western Tennessee and northern
Alabama, where the Hatchie River was nearly 3 feet above flood
stage at Bolivar, Tenn.
   Cool, unstable air dominated over the Great Lakes and the Ohio
Valley. Showers developed across sections of Ohio and Indiana and
also extended from central Montana across eastern Nebraska and
central Missouri into western Kentucky.
   Record heat continued across the southern and central Pacific
Coast thanks to the action of an upper-level high pressure system
off the coast of southern California. By noon, Palm Springs,
Calif., had already reached 102 and downtown Los Angeles hit 100
degrees.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Ironwood, Mich., to 106 at Ontario, Calif. Thursday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 16 at Warroad, Minn.
   For Friday, scattered showers and a few thunderstorms were
forecast from Arkansas and Missouri across the Ohio and Tennessee
valleys, the lower Great Lakes and the Appalachians to the middle
Atlantic Coast and northern New England. Scattered showers also
were forecast from Washington state across the northern Rockies to
western sections of the Dakotas.
   Highs in the 30s were predicted from eastern North Dakota across
the northern half of Minnesota to northern sections of the upper
Great Lakes; in the 40s and 50s from much of the northern and
central Plains across southern Minnesota, the middle Mississippi
Valley, southern sections of the upper Great Lakes, the Ohio Valley
and the Appalachians to the northern and middle Atlantic Coast; in
the 80s over the northern half of California and western sections
of the Great Basin, and from the southern Rockies across central
and southern Texas, the western half of the Gulf Coast region to
southern Florida; in the 90s over the southern half of Florida; and
above 100 over the desert Southwest.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher argued passionately Thursday in talks that covered weapons
sales to the Middle East and disarmament, officials said.
   The leaders described their private morning talks as friendly,
but a British spokesman said they argued energetically over the
Soviets' reported sale of long-range bombers to Libya or a possible
negotiated ban on chemical weapons.
   A Soviet spokesman said Gorbachev complained to Mrs. Thatcher, a
staunch U.S. ally, that President Bush's review of foreign policy
is threatening to stall the momentum of nuclear arms reduction
talks.
   In a toast at a dinner honoring Gorbachev, Mrs. Thatcher made
clear she is unshaken in her belief that at least some nuclear
weapons are necessary to deter war in Europe. Gorbachev replied he
could not accept that view.
   He said the prime minister considers him a romantic for
advocating a nuclear-free world, but he contended his position
``reflects the harsh realities of our time.''
   After a wreath-laying ceremony at Westminster Abbey, the Soviet
president stopped his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people
in a crowd of several hundred, showing off the spontaneity that has
won him popularity in the West.
   Later he met British businessmen and appealed to them to step up
trade with the Soviet Union, saying: ``I invite businessmen to act
and operate on the principle that the brave capture cities.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence after
four hours of talks, said the meeting was very friendly and covered
``all of the principal topics of the day.''
   Gorbachev said his fifth meeting with the conservative leader
reached ``a degree of mutual understanding'' that enabled them to
discuss the problems of nuclear arsenals, regional conflict and
specialized Soviet-British matters.
   A Thatcher spokesman said on condition of anonymity after the
talks that the two ``love arguing. They have this way of arguing
very strongly but never losing their tempers.''
   He also called the discussions ``extremely frank ... animated,
warm, passionate and solemn.''
   But there were no indications that the staunchly anti-communist
prime minister and the reform-minded Soviet Communist Party chief
resolved differences.
   The British spokesman said Mrs. Thatcher raised the reported
sale of Soviet long-range bombers to Libya, saying: ``We are sorry
you are doing this.''
   Gorbachev did not respond, the official said.
   Interviewed on Channel 4 News, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman
Gennady I. Gerasimov confirmed bombers were supplied to Libya under
a 1986 agreement, but insisted they were short-range defensive
aircraft.
   He said no more than six were delivered and that their range was
300 miles, not 800 miles as reported in Washington. They could not
reach Israel without refueling, and ``Libya has no refueling
capacity at all,'' Gerasimov said.
   ``You cannot really use it for offensive purposes,'' he said.
   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze also reportedly clashed over the
issue. Shevardnadze did not reply directly, but he noted Britain is
a major arms supplier to other Middle East countries.
   ``Our reply to that is, `Yes, but Libya is a terrorist state,''
the British spokesman said.
   At a news conference, Gerasimov charged that the Libyan arms
deal was leaked in Washington ``just to ruin the atmosphere'' of
the Soviet-British summit.
   Gerasimov also said that ``prolonged reviews of foreign policy''
could lead to a loss of momentum in disarmament talks.
   President Bush ordered a review of U.S. foreign policy when he
took office in January. The review is still under way, and Bush has
said he will not be ``stampeded'' by Soviet initiatives such as
disarmament proposals.
   In her toast at dinner, Mrs. Thatcher restated her opposition to
Gorbachev's call for total nuclear disarmament by the year 2000.
   ``Both our countries know from bitter experience that
conventional weapons do not deter war in Europe, whereas nuclear
weapons have done so for over 40 years,'' she said. ``As a
deterrent, there is no substitute for them.''
   Gorbachev responded he would stick to his proposal,
acknowledging several stages would be necessary before all nuclear
weapons are eliminated. He said Mrs. Thatcher thinks there is ``a
good measure of romanticism in this approach ... I cannot accept
that.''
   Shevardnadze and Howe signed agreements designed to protect
private business development and make it easier for individuals to
obtain visas.
   The British side also pledged to build a school in
earthquake-stricken Soviet Armenia, for which Gorbachev expressed
gratitude.
   Gorbachev originally planned to visit Britain in December, but
he canceled the trip after the earthquake wrecked cities and killed
thousands of people.
   Raisa Gorbachev toured St. Paul's Cathedral and visited Tower
Bridge for a view of the city through a chilly drizzle.
   Gorbachev is to address businessmen in a speech Friday. He then
goes to Windsor Castle to see Queen Elizabeth II before returning
to Moscow at the end of the six-day tour, which also took him to
Ireland and Cuba.

   62. On April 25, 1985, McFarlane informed President Reagan that
military support for the resistance from Honduras was in jeopardy
as a consequence of the House vote refusing to provide new funds
for the resistance. The Honduran military had stopped a shipment of
ammunition from an Asian country en route to the resistance after
it had arrived in Honduras. McFarlane recommended that President
Reagan call President Suazo to make clear that the executive branch
was determined to maintain pressure on the Sandinistas. During the
call between the two leaders, Suazo urged that the U.S. government
continue to oppose communism. President Reagan's personal notes of
his telephone call reflect that President Suazo told President
Reagan that the Honduras military commander would be ordered to
deliver the ammunition to the resistance. President Reagan pledged
his continued support for the resistance; President Suazo raised
the subject of U.S. government aid for his country. ...
   64. In May 1985, President Reagan personally approved increased
U.S. special support to Honduras and Guatemala for joint programs
with those countries.
   72. In mid-December 1985, Lt. Col. North and Admiral Poindexter
visited Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, and Honduras to
urge those countries to provide continued support for the armed
resistance.
   74. On December 20, 1985, Admiral Poindexter discussed with
President Reagan the provision of U.S. arms to Honduras.
   78. In mid-January 1986, Lt. Col. North prepared talking points
for a meeting between Admiral Poindexter, Vice President Bush, and
Honduran President Azcona. North recommended that Admiral
Poindexter and Vice President Bush tell President Azcona of the
need for Honduras to work with the U.S. government on increasing
regional involvement with and support for the resistance.
   79. In mid-January 1986, the State Department prepared a
memorandum for Donald Gregg (the vice president's national security
adviser) for Vice President Bush's meeting with President Azcona.
According to DoS, one purpose of the meeting was to encourage
continued Honduran support for the resistance. The memorandum
alerted Gregg that Azcona would insist on receiving clear economic
and social benefits from its cooperation with the United States. ...

   97. In late August 1986, North reported to Admiral Poindexter
that a representative of Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega had asked
North to meet with him. Noriega's representative proposed that, in
exchange for a promise from the USG to help clean up Noriega's
image and a commitment to lift the USG ban on military sales to the
Panamanian defense forces, Noriega would assassinate the Sandinista
leadership for the U.S. government. North had told Noriega's
representative that U.S. law forbade such actions. The
representative responded that Noriega had numerous assets in place
in Nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things, just as
Noriega had helped the USG the previous year in blowing up a
Sandinista arsenal. ...
   98. North advised Admiral Poindexter that the British persons
who had run the operation against the arsenal had used a Panamanian
civilian ordnance expert. North noted that Noriega had the
capabilities that he had proffered, and that the cost of any
operations could be borne by Project Democracy.
   99. Admiral Poindexter responded that if Noriega had assets
inside Nicaragua, he could be helpful. The USG could not be
involved in assassination, but Panamanian assistance with sabotage
would be another story. Admiral Poindexter recommended that North
speak with Noriega directly. ...
   106. In late September 1986, Lt. Col. North reported to Admiral
Poindexter on his London meeting with Noriega. Noriega would try to
take immediate actions against the Sandinistas and offered a list
of priorities including an oil refinery, an airport, and the Puerto
Sandino off-load facility.

   103. In late September 1986, Lt. Col. North advised Admiral
Poindexter that Costa Rican Interior Minister Garron had disclosed
the existene of the Santa Elena airstrip. North stated that
President Arias of Costa Rica had breached his understanding with
the U.S. government. Assistant Secretary of State Abrams and
Secretary of State Shultz wanted to cancel Arias' scheduled visit
with President Reagan and replace his appointment by scheduling a
meeting with President Cerezo of Guatemala. Admiral Poindexter
agreed. ...
   107. At the end of September 1986, Lt. Col. North reemphasized
to Admiral Poindexter that President Arias of Costa Rica should not
be invited to meet President Reagan in light of Arias' disclosure
of the Santa Elena airstrip. North recommended that Presidents
Duarte and Cerezo be invited to meet President Reagan instead,
because El Salvador and Guatemala had supported the resistance.

   Security forces engaged black
nationalist guerrillas in bitter combat Thursday as South Africa,
Angola and Cuba arranged emergency talks to salvage the
U.N.-sponsored plan for Namibia's independence.
   ``There is a crisis in Namibia,'' said a State Department
official in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``We've
got a real problem.''
   Chief Inspector Kierie du Rand, a South African who heads
Namibia territorial force, said 42 guerrillas were killed in
clashes Thursday afternoon, including one battle involving scores
of insurgents. An undetermined number of policemen were injured, he
said.
   Government-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said a ``pitched
battle ... raged for several hours'' Thursday between security
forces and about 200 guerrillas.
   Du Rand said at least 252 guerrillas of the South-West Africa
People's Organization and 24 members of the South African-led
security forces have been killed since gunbattles broke out
Saturday, when a cease-fire was supposed to take effect.
   Angola's state news agency quoted SWAPO defense spokesman Peter
Muehihange as saying only 38 guerrillas died in that time and nine
are missing. He said 20 security force members were killed.
   Foreign Minister Pik Botha of South Africa said his government
is committed to the plan to grant independence to Namibia, which
Pretoria has ruled for 74 years.
   South Africa claims SWAPO has sent more than 1,500 guerrillas
into Namibia in violation of an accord requiring the insurgents to
remain at their bases in Angola, at least 100 miles away.
   The South African Council of Churches, led by prominent
anti-apartheid clergymen, said ``the carnage of the last few days''
could have been prevented if the United Nations had denied South
Africa's request to let its forces leave their bases to combat the
guerrillas.
   It said the credibility of the U.N. peacekeeping force was in
doubt.
   A joint South African-Cuban-Angolan commission monitoring the
independence accord scheduled a meeting Saturday to discuss the
crisis. South Africa's President P.W. Botha said U.S. and Soviet
observers would participate.
   ``I trust that the commission will be able to find a peaceful
solution to the very serious situation which has arisen,'' he told
Parliament in Cape Town.
   Chester A. Crocker, the assistant secretary of state for African
Affairs, left Washington on Thursday to attend the commission
meeting.
   A Namibian police official, Chief Inspector Derek Brune,
reported more skirmishes Thursday across the 300-mile front near
the Angolan border. He said the guerrillas have broken up into
small groups and that some fighters were reported as far as 120
miles south of the border.
   Cedric Thornberry, second-in-command of the U.N. contingent,
said the United Nations hoped to have its first infantry battalions
in the battle areas early next week.
   The United Nations has authorized 4,650 troops for the Namibia
operation, but only 921 have arrived. The only forces in the battle
area are about 300 logistical personnel.
   The United Nations accepted a U.S. offer to fly 850 Finnish
soldiers to Namibia. Francois Giuliani, spokesman for
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, told reporters the men
could be arriving over the weekend.
   SWAPO officials said the guerrilla fighters had been inside
Namibia for some time and had no intention of leaving or accepting
a surrender proposal.
   But Thornberry said: ``It was made clear beyond a shadow of a
doubt to SWAPO that it would have to negotiate an additional
element'' to the U.N. plan if it wanted bases inside Namibia.
   The way for Namibian independence was cleared in December when
South Africa, Angola and Cuba signed an accord calling for
withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops who have helped Marxist Angola
battle U.S.-backed rebels.
   Besides granting Namibia independence, South Africa is to end
military aid to the Angolan rebels.
   SWAPO, which has been waging a war for independence for 23
years, is favored to win elections scheduled in November under the
U.N. plan.

<HEAD>Air Force Says Problem Does Not Stall Return of Bombers to the Air</HEAD>

   The Air Force said Thursday the in-flight loss
of escape hatches on two B-1B bombers would lead to more frequent
inspections of the equipment in the future but the problem had not
stalled the return of the bombers to the air.
   Col. Larry Greer, an Air Force spokesman, said 60 of the 97
B-1Bs in the fleet had been cleared for air operations by late
Thursday and that all of the B-1Bs scheduled for training flights
Thursday or Thursday night would be permitted to fly.
   The B-1B fleet has been slowly returning to the air this week
after being grounded in the wake of a March 27 incident at Dyess
Air Force Base, Texas. That incident involved the failure of gears
that move the wings on the swing-wing bomber.
   As that grounding order was being lifted this week, two B-1Bs
experienced unusual problems with the same escape hatch suddenly
blowing off during training flights.
   The first hatch-blowing incident occurred about 11 a.m. Tuesday
as the jet was climbing from a low-altitude exercise near the
Texas-New Mexico border. The 3-foot by 4-foot hatch blew off at
about 12,500 feet.
   Then at about 11:45 a.m. Wednesday, a hatch in the same place on
another B-1B blew off at about 19,000 feet as the jet flew over La
Junta Training Range near Pueblo, Colo.
   No one was injured and both airplanes made routine landings. But
the incidents caused the Air Force to order another inspection of
each plane before they took off on training flights.
   Greer said Thursday the Air Force had not recovered either of
the two hatches, but that inspections of the other planes in the
fleet suggested routine opening and closing of the hatches during
maintenance can gradually throw the locking latches ``beyond normal
tolerance levels.''
   ``We're going to perform the inspection on these hatches more
often,'' Greer said. ``It's part of the growing process with a new
plane. As equipment matures, you have to adjust your maintenance
and inspection schedules.''
   The spokesman added technicians also had discovered that by
painting a small stripe across the hatch inside the plane, it was
possible to provide an easy visual cue to the crew to make sure a
hatch is shut tight.
   As for the problem that prompted the grounding, Greer said that
87 B-1Bs had undergone the required inspection by Thursday and 60
had been cleared for flight.
   Ten are awaiting inspection. In the case of the other 27, he
continued, a gear box that handles drive shafts that help to move
the wings has been removed and shipped to the Sundstrand Corp., the
maker, for inspection.
   The spokesman declined to predict when the entire fleet would be
back in the air.

   The prosecutor who fought to keep Randall Dale
Adams in jail despite an overturned murder conviction has been
fired by the district attorney, who said his assistant mishandled
the case.
   Two other assistant prosecutors who worked on the case have
resigned, reportedly because they were embarrassed by the state's
bungled attempts to deny the imprisoned man his freedom.
   Winfield Scott, 48, who insulted a colleague and two judges
during a last-minute battle to keep Adams behind bars, was fired by
District Attorney John Vance on Wednesday.
   Vance told the Dallas Times Herald that Scott ``just did not
handle (the Adams case) the way I had told him to handle it. ... He
was convinced he was doing right and I was convinced he was doing
wrong.''
   Several phone calls by The Associated Press to Scott and Vance
were not returned Thursday.
   ``First Tom Landry and now Winfield Scott. Is no icon safe in
Dallas?'' asked Randy Schaffer, the Houston attorney who
represented Adams during appeals of his 1977 capital murder
conviction of a Dallas police officer.
   ``Apparently, the powers that be just perceived that they could
not longer keep him in the office. But I think he was just
following orders,'' Schaffer said. ``I guarantee you if he won the
recusal hearing (to oust state district Judge Larry Baraka from the
case), he wouldn't have been fired.''
   Adams, whose conviction for the 1976 slaying of a Dallas police
officer was overturned last month, was freed March 21 after
spending 12{ years in prison. At one point he came within three
days of execution.
   His case was resurrected with evidence uncovered in a
documentary by Errol Morris ``The Thin Blue Line,'' which strongly
suggested that Dallas officer Robert Wood was not slain by Adams,
but by witness David Harris.
   Acting on Baraka's recommendation, the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals ruled that the original prosecutor suppressed evidence
while at least two witnesses lied on the stand.
   Assistant district attorneys Leslie McFarlane and John Creuzot,
who represented the state in a December hearing on whether Adams
should receive a new trial, announced earlier this week that they
would leave the office by the end of the month. Both said they will
pursue private practices.
   ``It's time for me to move on,'' said Ms. McFarlane, 32, who has
been with the office 5{ years. ``It's time for me to leave.''
   ``It's time to move to greener pastures,'' said Creuzot, 31.
He's been with the office six years.
   But sources who asked not to be identified said both Ms.
McFarlane and Creuzot were embarrassed by the state's efforts to
keep Adams in jail.
   After Baraka granted Adams a personal recognizance bond, Scott
tried to have Baraka removed from the case and succeeded in getting
Adams' bond increased. At a hearing on the motion to oust Baraka
the next day, Scott insulted Baraka, Ms. McFarlane and the judge
who wrote the March 1 opinion overturning Adams' conviction.

   Raisa Gorbachev, on a whirlwind tour of London on
Thursday, watched a Punch and Judy show and appealed to children to
``let the flowers grow everywhere'' as a symbol of peace.
   Mrs. Gorbachev arrived late Wednesday night from Cuba with her
husband for a two-day visit, their second to London, and did not
seem to mind trading Cuba's hot sunshine for London's chilly rain.
   ``I feel quite fresh after Havana,'' she told reporters at Tower
Bridge during a five-minute stop at the misty River Thames.
   Visiting Prior Weston primary school, she received a bouquet of
red carnations and urged the children to ``tell your grown-up
brothers and sisters, your parents and your friends, that we spoke
about flowers growing throughout the world.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev sealed this wish with a kiss, leaving 9-year-old
Benjamin Robinson pink with embarrassment and adorned with two
bright-red lipstick kisses on his cheeks.
   ``I didn't dislike it. But I didn't like it either,'' Benjamin
said of his close encounter with the Soviet first lady.
   ``You have got a bit of history on your cheek,'' head teacher
Mary Caven told him.
   ``Eventually Mum will make me wash it off,'' Benjamin replied.
   Mrs. Gorbachev also toured the Museum of London, where she
watched a few scenes from a Punch and Judy show and saw an exhibit
commemorating Karl Marx, communism's founding father, who lived in
London and studied the poverty that afflicted the capital in the
19th century.
   ``I'm glad to come and see this great and beautiful city again
where history is in close touch with the present time. I've tried
to see as much as I can,'' she said.
   Mrs. Gorbachev started her sightseeing tour at St. Paul's
Cathedral, Sir Christopher Wren's architectural masterpiece.
   A small crowd of about 100 stood across the street in drizzling
rain as Mrs. Gorbachev arrived.
   At the entrance, 4-year-old Emma Scott presented her with pink
and white flowers. Mrs. Gorbachev picked her up, gave her a kiss
and presented her with a box of Russian chocolates.
   Her mother, Jane Scott, holding the opened box on the church
steps, said that while Mrs. Gorbachev was touring the cathedral,
Emma had already started eating the chocolates.
   ``They're lovely. She's had two,'' said Mrs. Scott, whose
husband is the cathedral's assistant music director.
   After she left, the dean of St. Paul's, the Very Rev. Eric
Evans, said Mrs. Gorbachev had been ``quite fascinated and very
impressed'' by her visit.
   He said Mrs. Gorbachev, an atheist, must have been touched by
the power of God.
   ``I don't think she found Christianity but I hope she found a
few Christians,'' he said. ``I don't think you could come to this
building without something of the glory rubbing off.''

<HEAD>UN Experts Say Soviets Will Allow International Appeals On Human
Rights</HEAD>

   U.N. human rights officials said Thursday
the Soviet Union has agreed to sign an accord allowing its citizens
to take human rights complaints directly to international
investigators.
   They said the Soviets would sign the Optional Protocol to the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
   Soviet acceptance of the document would be an extension of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's declaration in December that human
rights should be given new emphasis in international affairs.
   Rajsoomer Lallah of Mauritius, chairman of the Human Rights
Committee associated with the United Nations, and Fausto Pocar of
Italy of the committee told reporters the notice was unofficial and
the Soviets had not said when they would sign the protocol.
   Pocar said he received the assurances during ``a workshop at the
Center for Human Rights organized in Moscow in November.''
   Lallah said he also had received unofficial confirmation, and
added: ``In October we are going to examine the third periodic
(human rights) report of the U.S.S.R., and it is possible that by
then the decision will have been taken, or in process of being
taken.''
   A month ago, the Soviet Union said it would accept World Court
jurisdiction in cases based on the Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights and five other human rights treaties. The decision reversed
a long policy of resisting outside judgment of its practices.
   The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
guarantees the individual's right to life; freedom from torture,
inhuman or degrading treatment; freedom from slavery or forced
labor; freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention; freedom of
movement; freedom of thought, conscience and peaceful assembly, and
free association.
   U.S. officials praised last month's Soviet policy change but
noted that only governments, not individuals, can file legal
actions with the World Court, whose formal title is the
International Court of Justice.
   Pieter Kooijmans, U.N. special investigator on human rights,
said at the time: ``It would be a real breakthrough for human
rights if the Soviet Union would recognize the right of
individuals'' to file complaints of rights abuses.
   Under the Optional Protocol, individual citizens can complain of
rights abuses to the Human Rights Committee, an international body
of legal experts with the power to order compensation.
   Hungary ratified the protocol last year, joining 40 other
nations that recognize it.

   Someone who called 911 three times and
whined into the receiver sounded to the emergency dispatcher ``like
a kid playing on the phone.''
   The police officer who was dispatched to the apartment Tuesday
was about to summon a locksmith when he peered through a window and
saw the damsel in distress. It was Jenny, a miniature dachshund
puppy.
   ``(The dog) gets up there and dances around the table and hits
that little space bar and dials 911,'' said Officer Pete Renje.
   Jenny's owner, Chris Dolan, who got the puppy last week, has a
telephone with a button that automatically dials 911. The phone
also has a speaker.
   Jenny used both.
   The 911 system displayed the telephone number and address where
the call originated, and dispatcher Lynn Roberson called back. At
first, she got no answer. Then, she got an answering machine. Jenny
called twice more afterward.
   Dolan came home to find a police note on his door, asking him to
move the dog or the telephone.

   Repairman Charlie Transue has seen some
unusual cases, but no one had ever tried to deposit a hamster in a
telephone before.
   It began when Transue recently received a call telling him of an
``unusual case of trouble.''
   When the telephone repairman reached a convenience store, he
encountered a ``very distraught lady'' and her granddaughter.
   The granddaughter, about 8, had just placed her new pet, an
infant hamster, in the phone's coin-return bucket.
   When she closed the device, the hamster fell or crawled into a
small space just behind it.
   Transue, who works for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., took the
phone apart and found the tiny creature, apparently unhurt, in the
space behind the bucket.

<HEAD>Defense Contractor Says He Was Unaware of Bribes</HEAD>

   Two California executives charged with
bribery and conspiracy in the Pentagon fraud investigation said
Thursday they were unaware that a private consultant their company
had hired was bribing a Navy engineer.
   George H. Kaub and Eugene Sullivan, both former executive vice
presidents at Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., also
said the consultant, William Parkin, had an excellent reputation
for his expertise on government contracts.
   Defense attorney Mark Tuohey asked Kaub about Parkin, a private
consultant that Teledyne Electronics, a division of Teledyne Inc.,
hired to help it secure a lucrative Pentagon contract for hand-held
radar equipment.
   Parkin has admitted paying bribes to a Navy official for inside
information and has testified for the government. Both Parkin and
Navy engineer Stuart Berlin have pleaded guilty in the case.
   Asked Tuohey: ``Did you ever know that Mr. Parkin was paying off
three other people, including Berlin?''
   ``Absolutely not,'' Kaub responded.
   Sullivan concurred in that view.
   Kaub, one of three men on trial in Alexandria federal court, was
the first defendant to take the witness stand, followed by
Sullivan. Also on trial is Dale Schnittjer, who was Sullivan's
successor at Teledyne Electronics.
   The three face charges of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and
making false statements. The government claims they knew Parkin and
his associates were paying bribes to Berlin in order to secure the
radar contract.
   But the defense contends the executives were victims of a
conspiracy devised by Parkin.
   The defense is expected to continue Friday, while U.S. District
Judge Richard Williams has indicated closing arguments will be
Monday.
   Under cross-examination, Sullivan and Kaub said they never asked
Parkin about his business partners or sought details about his
operation before Teledyne Electronics hired him.
   ``You have to make an assumption that he was doing legitimate
work,'' said Kaub, noting Parkin worked for a number of well-known
defense contractors.
   Sullivan said Parkin told him that other consultants he had
hired ``didn't want their names revealed'' to protect other
business relationships, so Sullivan never asked.
   Kaub said he signed the contracts with Parkin in November 1985
that called for Parkin to receive $10,000 to help Teledyne
Electronics get permission to bid on the contract. Parkin, a former
Navy official, had a good reputation with Teledyne Electronics and
told officials there that ``he knew how to present himself, to
negotiate, lobby, whatever,'' Kaub said.
   Kaub also said the deal had a subcontract calling for Parkin to
receive $150,000 for future work should Teledyne Electronics be
successful in winning the radar job. The Pentagon awarded the
company the $24 million job in July 1987.
   Although details of Parkin's future work were not spelled out,
Kaub said the arrangement was not a contingency fee, which is
illegal under Pentagon procurement rules.
   Asked if he meant to conceal the $150,000 arrangement with
Parkin, Kaub said, ``Absolutely not. ... If you want to make
something illegal, you should hide it, not put it out in public.''
   Kaub said he had little contact with Parkin between 1985 and
late 1987. The defendant said he talked to the consultant for a
total of about 15 minutes on the telephone and spent about an hour
with him at a hotel near Washington in November 1987.
   At that meeting, Kaub said Parkin gave him two reports that
might be useful to Teledyne Electronics. Kaub said he found only
one contained valuable information while the other was ``just a
bunch of garbage.''
   Parkin has testified that he indirectly paid money to Berlin.
Parkin left government in October 1983 after a 17-year career
during which, he said, he accepted $50,000 in bribes.
   Teledyne Electronics already has pleaded guilty in the
government's investigation of fraud and corruption in the
Pentagon's massive procurement program. More than a dozen people
have pleaded guilty so far.
   In earlier testimony Thursday, Roy Lane, an executive of
Teledyne Inc., said he had known of Parkin's work for at least 20
years.
   ``I gained quite a respect for the man,'' said Lane, explaining
he had known Parkin when the latter was a contracting officer with
the Navy.
   ``I thought he was one of the most competent government
contracting officers,'' Lane said.

   A group led by former baseball commissioner
Peter V. Ueberroth agreed Thursday to buy strike-crippled Eastern
Airlines, and a union spokesman said he was cautiously optimistic
the deal could end the month-old walkout.
   The $464 million agreement would give employees a 30 percent
share in the company in exchange for wage concessions.
   The sale by Eastern's parent, Texas Air Corp., is subject to
approval by U.S. Bankruptcy Court and Eastern's creditors. Eastern
also must reach new work agreements with its striking unions by
midnight Tuesday, under terms of the sale.
   ``Under this agreement, Eastern can be back flying in very short
order,'' said Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, who has been the
target of bitter personal attacks from union members.
   About 500 striking Machinists jammed a union hall in Miami,
where Eastern is based, cheering and chanting, ``Take me out to the
ball game!'' and ``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Lorenzo's got to go!'' after
hearing of the sale.
   Eastern has been virtually paralyzed since March 4 by the
Machinists' strike, which has drawn the support of pilots and
flight attendants. Eastern filed March 9 for protection from
creditors in bankruptcy court as its cash dried up.
   ``It's a mammoth challenge,'' said Ueberroth. ``I'm convinced
that there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that I can
help bring together to help this airline.''
   The sale includes Eastern's highly profitable Northeast shuttle,
but Ueberroth will follow through on an earlier agreement to sell
the service to developer Donald Trump for $365 million.
   Ueberroth, who stepped down as baseball commissioner Saturday,
was vice president of Trans International Airlines for two years
and founded a travel agency in Southern California in 1963. First
Travel Corp. eventually grew into the second-largest agency in
North America.
   He was organizer of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, which turned
a profit of $230 million and put him on the cover of Time magazine
as Man of the Year. As baseball commissioner, he turned the game
from a $67 million-a-year money-loser to one that made $100 million
last year.
   Frank Ortis, vice president of Machinists Local 702 and Miami
strike coordinator, said it was impossible to tell whether unions
would fare better ``until we get into dealings with Commissioner
Ueberroth.''
   ``However, we're willing to give it a shot,'' he said.
   The Air Line Pilots Association issued a statement saying that
the union was encouraged but that strike issues had yet to be
resolved.
   ``Nonetheless, what we have heard so far leaves us cautiously
optimistic,'' said John Bavis, chairman of the 3,600-member union.
   Lorenzo will remain in charge of Eastern until the deal is
approved, but Ueberroth will help formulate the reorganization plan.
   Texas Air would get $200 million cash, Eastern notes worth about
$185 million, plus Eastern assets valued at about $79 million,
including Eastern's New York-Montreal routes plus eight landing
slots and one gate at New York's LaGuardia Airport.
   Ueberroth's group made a $464 million offer for Eastern last
week and withdrew it after being told it had been topped by another
suitor. But talks with Ueberroth's group resumed this week and
wound up Thursday.
   Under the deal, Ueberroth and Thomas Talbot, another former
airline executive from California, would own 30 percent of the
airline. Eastern's unions would get another 30 percent in exchange
for wage and work-rule concessions. Shares for the remaining 40
percent will be sold to investors.
   Many union leaders and rank-and-file members have said they
would accept concessions to help resurrect Eastern if they were
given independence from Texas Air, which bought the 60-year-old
carrier in 1986 for about $600 million.

<HEAD>Bell-Sponsored Survey Finds Support for Broader Bell Services</HEAD>

   A majority of telephone users think the seven
regional Bell companies should be allowed to enter the equipment
manufacturing, long-distance and information services markets,
according to a survey released Thursday by the telephone companies.
   In the random survey of 24,291 registered voters, 58 percent
agreed that Congress this year should consider lifting the
restrictions placed on the Bell companies in the 1984 breakup of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   In the AT&amp;T breakup, the regional phone companies were
prohibited from entering the phone equipment research, development
and manufacturing business and from providing their own
long-distance and information services to local and national
customers.
   The U.S. District Court in Washington reaffirmed those
prohibitions last year, saying the Bell companies, if freed from
their restraints, might engage in predatory pricing and
cross-subsidization of services and discriminate against
competitors wanting to use their phone lines.
   The court did allow the regional companies to provide
``gateway'' services through which users can call a single 800
number to gain access to a variety of services such as CompuServe
and The Source databases.
   Ed Reilly, president of Kennan Research of New York City, said
his company's survey found that ``Americans want American companies
freed to compete in providing telecommunications products and
services. Consumers want as many choices as possible.''
   According to Kennan:
   _74 percent of those surveyed said the seven Bell companies
should be allowed to compete in the long-distance arena.
   _78 percent thought those companies should be allowed to offer
information services, which could include electronic banking,
health monitoring, home security services and data bases.
   _79 percent said the Bell companies should be allowed to
research, develop and manufacture telephone equipment.
   _68 percent said the newspaper advertising business does not
need to be protected from electronic yellow pages that the Bell
companies could offer.
   _74 percent said allowing the seven companies to compete in the
telephone equipment market would strengthen U.S. competitiveness
against overseas manufacturers of high technology equipment.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said those surveyed weren't told
``there is already stiff and growing competition for AT&amp;T'' in
manufacturing equipment.
   AT&amp;T Chairman Robert Allen said in a recent speech in Washington
that the Bell companies, if allowed to begin manufacturing, might
be inclined to team with overseas manufacturers to avoid huge
development costs _ to the detriment of American workers.
   Linnen also said AT&amp;T never has opposed the Bell companies'
entry into the information services business.
   The survey was conducted by telephone from November through
January. It had a margin of error of less than 1 percent, Kennan
said.
   It was commissioned by Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth,
NYNEX, Pacific Telesis, Southwestern Bell and U.S. West. These
companies operate 22 local telephone companies.

   The mercury hit 100 and kept going Thursday
as Southern California sweated out the third day of a
record-breaking heat wave that sent thousands to the beach,
increased power demand and withered strawberries.
   Downtown Los Angeles, where the temperature peaked at 105
degrees Wednesday, registered 103 Thursday afternoon, breaking the
date's record of 91 set in 1932 and tied in 1962. San Diego's 98
made it the hottest April day on record.
   High pressure over the West squeezed warm air out of the
interior toward the populous coast, beating back sea breezes and
turning even the usually balmy beaches into a furnace for thousands
who rushed there instead of work.
   ``It started off with 80 degrees at sunrise and now it's up to
98 in the shade,'' said Santa Monica Beach lifeguard Randy
DeGregori.
   Southern California Edison said power demand to keep up with air
conditioning would beat the April record of 14,282 megawatts set
Wednesday. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the other
major local supplier of electricity, projected an April record need
for 4,700 megawatts by 4 p.m.
   Other hot afternoon readings around Southern California included
110 at Ontario, 108 at El Toro, 107 at Palm Springs, 104 at Long
Beach, 102 at San Bernardino, and 100 at Riverside, Blythe and
Santa Maria.
   Much of the rest of the state shared the warmth, though not the
triple digit readings. San Francisco and Sacramento hit the upper
80s.
   San Diego County grower Fran Hillebrecht watched three acres of
strawberries in Escondido wither in a 105-degree Santa Ana wind.
   ``They're really melting in this heat,'' she said. ``You can't
put enough water on the roots of the plant to keep it from losing
moisture.''
   Conversely, San Bernardino County agricultural biologist Mike
Cohen said early warming of the soil would help summer vegetables
just being planted.
   Since Tuesday, Orange County Ice Co. has sold about 30 tons a
day to food and liquor stores, compared to the five or six tons
normally delivered daily this time of year, said office manager
Jean Mann.
   Dr. George Gellert, a Los Angeles County health official, urged
people to take precautions ranging from simply wearing hats to
spending time in air-conditioned places such as shopping malls and
supermarkets.
   The 61-degree ocean water might deter beachgoers from plunging
in, but they should at least keep splashing themselves, Gellert
said.
   ``People going to the beach and not going into the water are
just exposing themselves to the sun. ... They may be better off
remaining in the shade.''
   Santa Ana winds out of the interior began warming the region
last weekend. By Tuesday, downtown Los Angeles reached 100 degrees,
tying the all-time April record.
   Even normally cool San Francisco felt the heat Wednesday with a
record high of 88, a full 8 degrees above the previous record that
had stood since 1924.
   At 5 a.m. Thursday the mercury had dropped only to 74 in
downtown Los Angeles and 88 at Laguna Peak above Point Mugu in
Ventura County. Even at 3 a.m. hundreds of people could be found
parked along beaches seeking respite.
   SoCal Edison's all-time record power use was last September when
its 3.8 million central and southern California customers used
15,987 megawatts.
   The DWP's all time record was 4,991 megawatts on Sept. 6, 1988.
Tuesday's usage was 4,073 megawatts and Wednesday's was 4,541
megawatts.
   Even if high temperatures remain in the same range, power use
increases over the span of a heat wave because lack of overnight
cooling causes heat buildup in buildings, requiring more power to
start up air conditioning each day.

   A truck driver who ignored a signal gate crashed into an
Illinois commuter train on Thursday, causing a derailment that
injured 58 people, authorities said. In Virginia, a second accident
involving an Amtrak train left 26 people hurt.
   Most of the injuries in both derailments appeared to be minor,
officials said.
   In a third accident in Princeton, Ind., a freight train derailed
and hit tanks containing farm pesticides and fertilizers, releasing
chemical fumes that forced evacuation of 1,300 students from nearby
schools for two hours, police said.
   Tom Perry, a police radio operator, said the CSX Corp. train
apparently ran off the end of a rail spur and struck two trucks
behind a grain elevator and fertilizer company owned by Cargill Inc.
   One woman was in satisfactory condition at Gibson General
Hospital after being splattered with the chemicals. She suffered
irritation of the skin and eyes in the 8:30 a.m. accident,
officials said.
   In Lemont, Ill., the gate was down and warning signals were
activated when the commuter train collision occurred about 7:25
a.m. some 40 miles southwest of Springfield, said Will County
Sheriff John Johnsen.
   ``The indication is that the driver of the truck ignored the
signals and drove around the gates,'' Johnsen said. The train
carried 98 people.
   The collision tore off the rear axle of the truck and its
storage bin, carrying it down the tracks about a quarter of a mile,
officials said.
   The truck driver, James Krueger of Sauk Village, was listed in
fair condition at Silver Cross Hospital in Joliet. Three others
were reported in fair condition at the hospital.
   ``I was reading my newspaper, and all of a sudden, I just heard
a loud boom,'' said passenger Jim Kaynish of Joliet. ``The lights
went out, and a couple of seconds later, it felt like we were going
through a bumpy field.''
   None of the passengers in his car appeared to be injured,
Kaynish said. People in the first car were covered ``from head to
toe'' with dust from the gravel, he said. The train carried 98
passengers.
   Damage to equipment amounted to at least $1 million, said Chris
Knapton, a spokesman for the Metra commuter rail line in Chicago.
He said one of the passenger cars was totally destroyed and the
others required repair. Damage to the locomotive would not be
assessed until it could be righted, he said.
   In addition, the collision ``chewed up about 750 feet of track
that will have to be replaced,'' Knapton said. The track belongs to
Illinois Central Gulf, he said.
   Officials from Amtrak, which also uses the line, said trains
between Chicago and Springfield and Chicago and St. Louis were
rerouted.
   In the second passenger accident, six cars and both engines of
an Amtrak train carrying 519 passengers derailed near the
Virginia-North Carolina border, authorities and witnesses said.
   The derailment occurred at 2:08 p.m. near Skippers, about 50
miles south of Richmond, said Amtrak supervisor Sam Wilson. The
train was traveling from Tampa, Fla., and Miami to New York.
   Six people with minor injuries were admitted to Halifax Memorial
Hospital in Roanoke Rapids, N.C., said spokeswoman Val Short.
   Twenty people, most of them complaining of back and neck pains,
were treated at Greensville Memorial Hospital in Emporia, said
spokesman Dave Magruder. One woman was transferred to the Medical
College of Virginia Hospitals in Richmond for treatment of a back
injury; another woman was admitted to Greensville, but Magruder
said he didn't know the extent of her injuries.
   The cause of the derailment was not known, said Clifford Black,
an Amtrak spokesman in Washington.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Delay of Plan to Abolish Crime Strike Force</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bipartisan group of four senators asked
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Thursday to delay any plans to
abolish the Justice Department's Organized Crime Strike Force
Program, saying such a move could ``hamper federal law enforcement
capabilities.''
   ``Given the success of the Organized Crime Strike Force Program
over the past 20 years, we believe that a decision to abolish the
strike forces could hamper federal law enforcement capabilities at
a time when many areas are overwhelmed with organized crime and
illegal drug activity,'' the letter said.
   The letter _ signed by Democrats Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts and Sam Nunn of Georgia as well as Republicans Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ was
delivered to the Justice Department after Thornburgh had left for
the day, said aide Dave Runkel.
   Recently, Thornburgh ``has said he was leaning in favor of
merging those offices into the U.S. attorneys' offices,'' Runkel
said. ``He said he felt that would enhance the federal efforts
against organized crime.''
   The U.S. attorneys around the country have recommended _
unanimously, according to Runkel _ that the strike forces ``be
assimilated into the U.S. attorneys' offices.'' The recommendation
is under review by the Justice Department criminal division and is
expected to be forwarded to Thornburgh soon, Runkel said.
   ``A lot of the organized crime business these days is, in fact,
drugs, and when you fence the U.S. attorneys out of those cases,
that doesn't seem to be the right thing to do,'' Runkel said. ``It
seems appropriate to merge them and have one federal prosecutor
rather than two federal prosecutors in the same parts of the
country.''
   There are strike forces in about two dozen major cities around
the country.
   Runkel noted that the strike force in New York was merged with
the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan several years ago.
   ``Under the past three U.S. attorneys, New York was the most
active in the country in the fight against organized crime,'' he
said.
   The senators noted that Thornburgh has said in speeches and in
testimony before Congress that ``some of the reasons giving rise to
the establishment of organized crime strike forces still apply,
including the need for seasoned prosecutors who can commit the time
necessary to prepare these cases and who are free of daily criminal
docket obligations.''
   The 1988 drug bill, they wrote, included a provision requiring a
comprehensive reorganization study that should be completed in
several months.
   ``A decision as important as this would benefit from the results
of that study,'' the letter said. ``Accordingly, we urge you to
delay any such decision until the appropriate committees of the
Congress have reasonable time to consider your proposal. We pledge
to do so expeditiously.''

   Influential Palestinians expressed skepticism
Thursday about President Bush's call for elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israeli officials, however, said they were encouraged by the
outcome of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's visit to Washington.
   Shamir told his aides his meeting with Bush Thursday was ``an
excellent meeting, more than I ever expected,'' Israel television
reported.
   Other Israeli reports indicated Shamir disagreed with the
Americans on some issues, notably the U.S. demand to stop Jewish
settlement in the occupied lands.
   Israeli journalists reporting from Washington quoted Shamir as
saying a timetable for discussing the elections idea will be set in
the next few days.
   Israel radio said joint U.S-Israeli teams will be created to
work out concrete proposals leading to elections.
   ``I think that in general, the positive U.S. response to the
elections idea is encouraging and raising hopes,'' Foreign Ministry
spokesman Alon Liel told The Associated Press.
   Some Palestinians expressed the fear that Shamir proposed
elections as a ploy to sidestep the Palestine Liberation
Organization and block its key demand that a Palestinian state be
created.
   ``I believe it's a trick because I don't believe the Israelis
want true peace,'' said Jack Khazmo, editor of the pro-PLO weekly
Al Bayader Assiyasi.
   ``If they did, they would go to an international conference and
accept the idea of land for peace,'' Khazmo said in an interview in
Jerusalem, where his newspaper is published.
   Also Thursday, a Palestinian died of a gunshot wound sustained
in earlier violence, and an Israeli soldier shot and critically
wounded a teen-age protester in Bethlehem, witnesses and Arab news
reports said.
   In other clashes in the occupied lands, troops shot and wounded
at least eight Palestinians.
   Doctors at Jerusalem's Mukassed Hospital said Salem Ismail
Salah, 27, of the West Bank village of Deir Salah, died Thursday of
head wounds sustained during a clash with troops March 30.
   Chanting ``PLO! Israel No!'' about 200 people in Deir Salah
waved outlawed Palestinian flags and followed Salah's coffin.
   His death brings to 420 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising against Israeli occupation started in December 1987.
Eighteen Israelis also have died.
   In nearby Bethlehem, reporters watched four soldiers fire live
ammunition to disperse 100 Palestinians who were throwing stones
and bottles.
   One soldier chased 17-year-old Dahoud Khaled Nassar. He knelt on
the ground, took aim, and shot the youth in the head twice from
about 40 yards away.
   An army spokesman confirmed a Palestinian youth was wounded, but
denied a live bullet hit Nassar, who was in critical condition at
Mukassed Hospital. Army regulations permit troops to fire live
ammunition only when their lives are in danger.
   Shamir's election proposal was the main idea he brought to
Washington to help resolve the conflict that has provoked much
criticism of Israeli army methods.
   Leading PLO supporters in the occupied territories did not rule
out elections, but said balloting must be part of a comprehensive
peace plan, including a timetable for negotiations on a final
settlement.
   Jonathan Kuttab, a human rights activist in the West Bank, said
as a prerequisite for elections, Israel would have to lift military
orders banning freedom of expression for the 1.7 million
Palestinians in the occupied lands.
   He said Israel also would have to end detentions without trial
and stop deporting Palestinian activists.

<TEXT>
   Leftist rebels attacked two
major military bases in a nationwide offensive Thursday and asked
the right-wing victors in El Salvador's presidential election to
declare themselves a transition government.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said its
drive came in response to a surge in repression following the
victory by the Republican National Alliance, or Arena, in March 19
elections. A communique from the rebel general command accused
Arena of sponsoring the repression.
   In a proposal issued separately in Mexico City, the rebels asked
the incoming Arena government for broad talks embracing government,
rebels, the military and all political parties. It said Arena
should declare itself a transitional government until new elections
can be held.
   ``Without negotiations no one can govern El Salvador,'' it
warned.
   There was no immediate reaction to the offer.
   Authorities said at least 10 people died and 12 were wounded at
the 4th Army Brigade headquarters in northern Chalatenango province
and at the army engineers base in Zacatecoluca.
   The Farabundo Marti proposal demanded a massive cut in the armed
forces and an end to U.S. military aid. It came on the eve of a
meeting between President Bush and the Salvadoran president-elect,
Alfredo Cristiani.
   The two are expected to discuss American demands for an improved
human rights situation in El Salvador. The administration expects
to have trouble getting Congress to approve further aid to El
Salvador unless the human rights situation improves here.
   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos, discussing the
offensive, said ``Arena is clearly implementing a policy of
capturing popular movement leaders and activists.'' The communique
warned that ``every repressive action will receive a telling
response from us.''
   Arena has been linked to right-wing death squads and security
force extremists that killed thousands of suspected leftists in the
early 1980s. Arena leaders deny any role in the rightist terror.
   Union and student activists have disappeared or been killed
since the March 19 elections. But human rights groups consulted by
The Associated Press said they do not have enough information to
document a postelection surge in rightist violence.
   The national teachers' union, ANDES, on Thursday denounced the
slaying of Cristina Gomez, a 40-year-old union member and teacher
at the capital's John F. Kennedy school.
   A union statement said heavily armed men in civilian clothes
forced her into a dark-windowed Jeep Cherokee when she left school
at midday Wednesday. Her body was discovered with two bullets in
the head that afternoon.
   Dark-windowed Cherokees are a trademark of right-wing death
squads.
   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, commander of the 4th Brigade in El
Paraiso, 37 miles north of San Salvador, said three soldiers and
three guerrillas died in a predawn attack and five soldiers were
wounded. He said the rebels did not penetrate the brigade's
perimeter, but several mortar shells landed inside.
   Guerrillas also attacked military engineers in Zacatecoluca, 35
miles southeast of San Salvador.
   Col. Benjamin Canjura, the post commander, said seven civilians
were wounded when homemade guerrilla artillery fell short of the
military installation. He said three soldiers were killed pursuing
retreating rebels.
   Canjura and Lopez spoke to the AP by telephone.
   The new rebel proposal, directed to the ``future government of
Arena,'' said Arena could either intensify the war or assume the
role of a transitional government to peace.
   Cristiani said repeatedly the rebels must lay down arms before
negotiations take place, something the Farabundo Marti regards as
tantamount to surrender.
   The Farabundo Marti called for talks on political, military and
economic matters with the Arena government, the armed forces and
all political parties.
   It proposed a negotiated cease-fire, to be followed in six
months by elections for a new president, mayors nationwide and a
constituent assembly to rewrite El Salvador's 6-year-old
consititution.
   The proposal said the Farabundo Marti would participate in
elections as a party in its own right, not as a supporter of
existing parties or coalitions as the rebels suggested in a January
proposal that was rejected.
   President Jose Napoleon Duarte, who has terminal liver cancer,
is to hand over power to Cristiani on June 1. Duarte's physician,
Dr. Jose Luis Saca, said Thursday that Duarte's condition had
worsened but he could return to work next week.

   A document produced at Oliver North's trial
Thursday depicted George Bush _ for the first time _ as helping
carry out the Reagan administration's secret program to sustain the
Nicaraguan Contras when Congress had forbidden U.S. aid.
   Then-Vice President Bush served as an intermediary for President
Reagan in assuring the president of Honduras in the spring of 1985
of expedited U.S. military and economic aid, according to a 42-page
``admission of facts'' agreed to by the government and read to the
jury by North's defense attorneys.
   The document established a ``quid pro quo'' relationship between
continuing third-country assistance to the Contras and the
availability of U.S. assistance to those countries. But Bush was
not described in the document as having cited such a linkage in his
May 1985 meeting with then-President Roberto Suazo of Honduras.
   The document, nevertheless, revealed Bush as actually playing a
role in the effort to keep the Contras alive as a fighting force
during the period of the Boland Amendment prohibition on American
involvement. This is a portrait of Bush that never emerged in the
final Iran-Contra investigative reports by a presidential review
board and a joint congressional committee.
   Asked Thursday about the revelation of Bush's go-between role
with the Honduran leader who was being pressed by the United States
to continue helping the Contras, White House press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater said: ``We can't say anything. It would become a part of
the case.''
   Bush declined to comment on the document when asked about it at
a dinner party for visiting Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
Bush said he hadn't seen the document, ``and I don't worry about
it.''
   Both the presidential commission, headed by former Sen. John
Tower, R-Texas, and the congressional panels, found no meaningful
role by Bush in the scandal that resulted from the covert sales of
U.S. arms to Iran and the subsequent diversion of the proceeds to
the Nicaraguan resistance fighters.
   Bush has said that he supported Reagan's Iranian arms-sale
initiative, but that he voiced reservations about what would happen
if it ever became public.
   Portions of the document read Thursday did, however, show Bush
as an enthusiastic supporter of the effort to tide over the Contras
until direct U.S. assistance could be resumed.
   In early March 1985, for instance, Bush asked then-national
security advisor Robert McFarlane to say whether he (the vice
president) should ``encourage a private group to donate a planeload
of medical supplies that would arrive in Honduras coincident with''
Bush's meeting with Suazo.
   ``Bush strongly favored such a flight,'' the document said,
``noting that the (unidentified) group was supportive of the
resistance.'' It said that North told McFarlane that Bush's idea
was a sound one. The document did not reveal whether the planeload
of supplies actually arrived in conjunction with his visit.
   Bush has denied ever having any knowledge of a diversion of
arms-sales proceeds to the Contras. And Donald Gregg, national
security adviser to Bush when Bush was vice president, has
testified that he did not pass on to Bush information about Contra
resupply effort that Gregg had learned from Felix Rodriguez, a
one-time Gregg CIA associate.
   A source involved in the Iran-Contra congressional
investigation, speaking on grounds of anonymity, said Thursday that
Bush ``didn't leave very many footprints anywhere. It needs to be
said that the extent of his knowledge was not our major goal. We
were more interested in what the president (Reagan) knew.''
   But this source also said that ``it was because he (Bush) left
so few footprints, I think, that he was treated so well in the
(final investigative) report'' by the congressional panel.
   Victoria Goldstein, a spokeswoman at the Honduran Embassy here,
said she had no information about the Bush-Suazo meeting. But she
said, ``The embassy would not have been involved.''
   According to the document, Bush personally told Suazo during the
May 1985 in Honduras that extra aid was being funneled to his
country. In earlier testimony, McFarlane had said the aid was part
of a secret agreement calling for Honduras to help the Contras.
   McFarlane testified that Reagan personally approved the secret
deal to slip $110 million in extra aid to Honduras as one of
several ``quid pro quo'' arrangements with other countries in
exchange for support for the Contras.
   McFarlane said in cross-examination that Reagan telephoned Suazo
to gain the release of an arms shipment to the Contras that had
been seized by a Honduran military commander.
   The statement entered in court Thursday said: ``Vice President
Bush also informed Suazo that President Reagan had directed that
currently withheld economic assistance for Honduras should be
released, that the United States would provide from its own
military stocks critical security assistance items that had been
ordered by Honduran armed forces, and that several security
programs under way for Honduran security forces would be enhanced.''
   In a Dec. 3, 1986 speech to the American Enterprise Institute
here _ little more than a week after the Iran-Contra affair broke
into public view _ Bush said that while he was aware of Reagan's
Iranian initiative and had supported it, ``I was not aware of _ and
oppose _ any diversion of funds, any ransom payments or any
circumvention of the will of the Congress.''
   The document also revealed that Bush saw several North memoranda
involving the secret U.S. effort to aid the Contras, although it
did not contradict Bush's assertions that he never knew about the
diversion of the Iranian arms-sales proceeds to the resistance.
   At another point, the document shows that Bush was included in
the distribution of a memo making it clear that leaders of
Guatemala were conditioning continued support for the Contras on a
doubling of U.S. economic assistance to Guatemala.

<HEAD>Ravens to Die in Effort to Save Desert Tortoise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal officials plan to shoot
and poison up to 1,500 ravens in the Mojave Desert in an effort to
save the desert tortoise, which is a favorite meal of the predatory
birds.
   Animal damage control officers with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture will kill ravens by injecting hard-boiled eggs with
poison and placing the eggs on elevated platforms where the ravens
will find and eat them.
   The ravens are killing young tortoises by the thousands and
contributing to an alarming decline of tortoise populations in the
desert, said biologists with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management,
the agency that developed the raven control program.
   Bureau of Land Management officials obtained a permit this week
from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to kill the birds, the San
Bernardino Sun reported Tuesday.
   The birds are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The
permit represents the largest sanctioned killing of ravens in the
Western states, said Agent Tom Riley of the Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   National Audubon Society officials oppose the program and local
Audubon officials called it short-sighted and excessive.
   ``I'm a little annoyed at this,'' said Bob McKernan, president
of the San Bernardino Valley Audubon Society. ``In general the BLM
is not doing its job throughout the desert on a variety of levels.
... It bothers me that they are now having to go to these extremes
to eliminate or reduce a population.''
   Roads, dumps, homes, power lines and sewage plants in the desert
have helped boost raven populations 15-fold during the last two
decades, BLM biologists said.
   The $50,000 raven control program, set to begin within the next
two weeks, will last about four months and will be conducted in
three areas, including the Desert Tortoise Natural Area preserve
near California City, said Ted Rado, a wildlife biologist with the
U.S. Bureau of Land Management.
   The bait platforms, at least four feet high, will prevent other
animals such as kit foxes and coyotes from eating the poisoned
eggs, Rado said.
   Ravens die within 24 to 48 hours after eating the poison.
Officials plan to shoot ravens and capture some with nets fired
from cannons to supplement the poisoning program.
   Ravens favor tortoises seven years old and younger because their
fingernail-thin shells are easily punctured with their beaks. As
more and more young tortoises are eaten, fewer reach maturity and
the adult reproductive population shrinks.
   In two studies, BLM biologists attributed 88 percent of tortoise
deaths to ravens. But critics remain skeptical that ravens can
cause so much damage.

<HEAD>Arafat Says Assassination Squads Seek PLO Leaders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat was quoted
Wednesday as saying assassination squads have been deployed in
European and Arab countries to kill Palestinian leaders.
   The editor-in-chief of the London-based weekly Al-Majalla quoted
Arafat as saying the teams of killers are of different
nationalities, including one Palestinian.
   ``There are three groups, but according to the names available
to me only one person involved is a Palestinian and the rest belong
to other nationalities,'' Arafat was quoted as saying.
   ``There have always been such attempts perpetrated by the
Israelis, international intelligence agencies and Arab agents.''
   There was no elaboration.
   Excerpts from the interview ran in the weekly's Jidda-based,
sister English-language newspaper, Arab News, which is sold in
Manama.
   According to the publication, Arafat said the assassination
efforts were aimed at halting progress after last year's peace
initiative by the Palestine Liberation Organization led to the
United States lifting a 13-year ban on dealing with the guerrilla
organization.
   Arafat also was quoted as saying he did not provide information
to the Americans that could help disclose the identity of the
terrorists who planted a bomb aboard a Pan Am jet which blew up in
December over Lockerbie, Scotland.
   ``We haven't reached such type of coordination with the United
States,'' he said.
   The PLO, he was quoted as saying, was not ready to cooperate
with the United States in combating terrorism under the definition
now being applied to the word ``because it is we who are victims of
state terrorism.''
   The definition has been considered controversial because the PLO
insists any attacks on Israeli military targets are legitimate
resistance, since Israeli forces occupy the West Bank and Gaza
Strip where a Palestinian state is foreseen.
   But Arafat was quoted as stressing in the interview: ``We refuse
to blow up aircraft or kill civilians because these are crimes
against humanity and those responsible for them should receive no
mercy.''
   The report quoted Arafat as saying he believed the dialogue
between the United States and the PLO reflected ``seriousness ...
by the American administration in seeking fruitful results that
would give a strong push to the Middle East peacemaking process.''
   According to the publication, the PLO chief reiterated the
standing PLO request for U.N. forces to replace the Israelis in the
occupied territories. When asked if he would accept the presence of
U.S. forces instead, as an Arafat aide recently suggested, Arafat
was quoted as saying he would have to convene the PLO Central
Council to consider the proposal.
   The Central Council is a liaison body between the PLO leadership
and its legislative body, the Palestine National Council.
   The report said Arafat was interviewed in Tunis before the
Central Council elected him as president of the self-proclaimed
independent Palestinian state.

Mohammad Mousavi Khoeniha announced that 65 drug smugglers will be
executed on Thursday, Tehran radio reported.
   Koeniha also was quoted Wednesday as saying that if smugglers
gave themselves up before getting caught, their sentences would be
reduced.
   The radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khoeniha as saying that
a strict new anti-narcotics law had been very successful in
stamping out drug smuggling. He said that so far 313 smugglers had
been executed since the law took effect Jan. 21.
   The new law carries the death sentence for possession of even
small quantities of drugs.
   Khoeniha said that ``as long as there is even one drug smuggler
left in the country, the executions shall continue.''
   The new crackdown on drug smugglers is an effort to combat
rampant drug addiction in the country.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials said Wednesday they
broke up a major international counterfeit ring, confiscating $12
million in counterfeit U.S. currency and arresting a West German
and an Israeli accomplice.
   The counterfeiters had operated since at least 1987 and their
bogus money has turned up in several European cities and in Africa,
said Jochen Schroers, spokesman for the Frankfurt prosecutors'
office.
   Schroers said investigators seized 235 pounds of counterfeit
U.S. $100 bills with a total face value of $12 million.
   He said it was the largest seizure of counterfeit money in West
German history.
   Printing machines and high-quality paper used by the
counterfeiters were also confiscated in raids March 20 in Frankfurt
and the surrounding area, Schroers said.
   Two of the counterfeit ring's alleged organizers _ a 49-year-old
Israeli and a 43-year-old West German businessman from the
Frankfurt area _ were arrested, and an arrest warrant was issued
for a third suspect, Schroers said.
   The spokesman refused to provide further information on any of
the suspects.
   According to Schroers, West German authorities received their
first clues about the counterfeiters in 1987 when they heard the
ring wanted to circulate a large amount of their bogus money.
   ``We knew no more than that, until late summer 1988 when the
first hundred or so hundred-dollar bills surfaced in various
European cities, especially East Europe, but also in Africa,''
Schroers said.
   He said that American and Israeli authorities provided
information about links between the counterfeitiers operating in
West Germany with another ring that was active in 1983 and 1984.
   Schroers said equipment used by the earlier group had come from
Frankfurt.
   According to Schroers, a member of the earlier ring who is now
in jail in Austria gave authorities information that led to the
arrest of the Israeli man suspected of involvement in the new ring
of counterfeiters.
   West German police confiscated the printing equipment, paper and
counterfeit bills in raids on two residences and a business in the
Frankfurt area, Schroers said.

<TEXT>
   No B-1B bombers will fly until their escape
hatches are inspected in the wake of two instances in which the
hatches flew off, the Strategic Air Command announced Wednesday
   Asked if the planes had been grounded again, Col. Larry Greer,
SAC's director of public affairs at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb.,
said:
   ``That's your word. I didn't use that word.
   ``At the moment they are inspecting all of the airplanes. We
expect that will be completed and they will be flying again late
(Thursday) afternoon.''
   Ejection hatches on two B-1B bombers from Dyess Air Force Base
in Abilene, Texas, mysteriously blew off during training flights
just a day apart, a base official said Wednesday.
   No one was hurt in either incident, Maj. Mary Beth Kilgore said.
   ``At this time, both incidents are under investigation,'' Ms.
Kilgore said. ``They're looking at them now, but there's no
evidence to link these two (incidents).''
   Greer said about 40 of the 97 planes had been returned to flying
status following last week's inspections, which focused on sweeping
wings.
   The Air Force had placed B-1B bombers back in training service
just Monday, after canceling training runs for a week because of a
March 27 incident in which another Dyess-based B-1B punctured a
fuel tank because of a malfunction in its moveable wing.
   The first hatch-blowing incident occurred about 11 a.m. Tuesday
as the jet was climbing from a low-altitude exercise near the
Texas-New Mexico border, Ms. Kilgore said. The 3-foot by 4-foot
hatch blew off at about 12,500 feet.
   About 11:45 a.m. Wednesday, a hatch in the same place on another
B-1B blew off at about 19,000 feet as the jet flew over La Junta
Training Range near Pueblo, Colo., Ms. Kilgore said.
   Both airplanes returned to Dyess for routine landings, she said.
   Both hatches were above the offensive systems operator's seat,
on the right rear side of the cockpit. The B-1B regularly carries
four crew members, and each _ the pilot, co-pilot, offensive
systems operator and defensive systems operator _ has his own
ejection hatch.
   The hatch is one or two feet above the crew member's head.
   ``When they're in there, (crew members) have got their helmets
on and they're strapped in,'' Ms. Kilgore said, adding that the
loss of the hatches didn't affect either plane's flight.
   The metal hatches fell over unpopulated areas, and neither had
been recovered by Wednesday afternoon.
   Officials with the Air Force and Rockwell International Corp. _
the plane's manufacturer _ were inspecting the aircraft Wednesday,
Ms. Kilgore said.
   The B-1B has been the most maligned aircraft in service history,
with controversy over the plane's electronic defense system and the
moveable wings. The planes have been grounded three times in the
past 18 months.

   Two flight crewmen were killed Wednesday when
their F-111 fighter-bomber crashed during war games on the Nellis
Air Force Base bombing range, Air Force officials said.
   The crewmen, whose names were withheld pending notification of
relatives, died when their F-111 crashed about 4:30 p.m. on the
sprawling range north of Las Vegas, said Air Force Maj. Victor
Andrijauskas.
   The crewmen were assigned to a unit operating out of Lakenheath,
England, and were at Nellis participating in Red Flag training
exercises when the crash occurred.
   Andrijauskas said the two-seat jet crashed about 60 miles
southeast of Tonopah, Nev., which is about 200 miles north of Las
Vegas.
   He said the cause of the crash was not immediately known.
   Red Flag training exercises are held several times a year on the
Nellis range, where Air Force crews from around the world are
trained in realistic combat simulations.
   All planes in the Air Force combat inventory during Red Flag
exercises fly on bombing runs or engage in air-to-air combat
against aggressor aircraft with fliers in them who are trained to
fight like Warsaw Pact air crews.
   The F-111 is a medium-range swing-wing aircraft capable of
carrying nuclear weapons. It was used in the 1986 raid on Libya.

   When the tanker Exxon Valdez hit the
rocks, so did Alaska's marriage of convenience with the oil
industry.
   But despite the environmental and economic damage wrought by the
nation's worst oil spill, Alaska is unlikely to divorce itself from
an industry whose taxes fund 85 percent of state services.
   Elected officials and political observers say the relationship
instead will be marked by greater mistrust and skepticism, and
future oil development in Alaska may be curtailed.
   ``I guarantee Alaska won't have the same trust in the industry
that it had in the past,'' Senate President Tim Kelly said Tuesday.
``We're going to take the Missouri attitude: Show me.''

   Two major oil companies have limited gasoline
deliveries to wholesale distributors in Western states in what one
spokesman called the first U.S. gas rationing since the Arab oil
embargo of the early 1970s.
   The limits were meant to prevent hoarding of gasoline in the
wake of the Alaska oil spill, spokesmen for Shell Oil Co. and
Chevron Corp. said Wednesday.
   Shell's decision to put a cap on its deliveries to wholesalers
in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Utah, Nevada and Arizona
resulted from excessive buying by distributors in the last week,
said Bill Gibson, a company spokesman in Houston.
   He denied Shell's ``supply management program'' was put into
effect because of shortages in crude supplies.

   The Bush administration is considering a
proposal to require that gun buyers register semiautomatic assault
rifles of the kind linked to mounting drug-related violence.
   An administration official acknowledged that the proposal, among
others, is being studied by government agencies as the
administration weighs additional steps to control the deadly
weapons.
   ``I've been asked to give comments on that and a lot of other
proposals that were made,'' Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said Wednesday. ``The
administration is involved in looking at the entire issue getting
input from a lot of people, of which this agency is one.''
   Higgins made the comments after the administration moved to
widen its temporary import ban on assault rifles to include
virtually all foreign-made models.

   The Bush administration, disappointed that
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is not withdrawing military support from
Nicaragua, is accusing the Soviet president of empty rhetoric
regarding Central American peace.
   ``While his words about not exporting revolution are welcomed,
they are not matched by deeds which would give those words
credence,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Wednesday, referring to Gorbachev's denunciation of the export of
revolution.
   Gorbachev's comments in his speech in Havana on Tuesday
conflicted with the policy of Cuban President Fidel Castro, who
supports the spread of revolutionary movements.
   But, in a written statement read by Fitzwater, the White House
called on Gorbachev to back up his statements about wanting
demilitarized peace zones in Central America by discontinuing
military assistance to the leftist government of Nicaragua.

   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa and Interior Minister Gen.

   American diners with a death wish can now risk
sushi-cide with fugu, a seafood delicacy that becomes the last
supper for 100 Japanese each year.
   The raw fish arrived in New York City last week, appearing on
the menus of seven Manhattan restaurants and making the United
States the only country outside Japan where fugu is found.
   But the man who brought the gourmet delight stateside promised
Wednesday this fugu couldn't hurt a fly, unlike the badly prepared
fugu that's fatal to half the people who eat it. Every year about
100 Japanese eat a fatal fugu meal.
   ``There is no danger at all,'' said a confident Nobuyoshi
Kuraoka, owner of Restaurant Nippon in midtown Manhattan.

<HEAD>Why Housing's Troops Are On The Alert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Under current tax law, a homeowner may deduct
interest on a home mortgage loan as large as $1 million, an amount
far beyond the borrowing ability of most middle-class Americans.
   Despite this, real estate and home building organizations are
determined not to let the million dollar ``cap'' be reduced by a
single dollar, defending their stand as being in the interest of
middle-class homeowners.
   Taking a ``stand'' doesn't begin to suggest their determination.
Leaders of housing-related industries sound these days like
military commanders determined to give no ground. They have made up
their minds, they have drawn the line. It is $1 million.
   For Congress to tamper with deductibility, says Kent Colton,
executive vice president of the National Association of Home
Builders, would be to risk a taxpayer rebellion. He says it could
``strike at the heart of middle America.''
   Ira Gribin, president of the National Association of Realtors,
is equally concerned. ``Guarding against threats to homeownership
and private property rights in general is similar to manning a fire
station,'' he said recently. ``You have to be on duty all the time,
not just when there's a fire.''
   Few issues have ever fired up the two industries to such an
extent. Nearly 20,000 Realtors have sent letters to President Bush
seeking his help against the threat. It has been made a plank in
the Home Builders Statement of Policy.
   Many people think the alert is overdone, that the vigilance is
uncalled for. If there is a threat, they say, it is hardly a
visible one.
   Even before his election, the president endorsed the tax
deduction as it now stands and has given no indication of changing
his mind. And Senate and House members have given their assurances
that no changes are likely.
   The Realtors say the office of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Tex,
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has said the subject is
off the table, or not up for reconsideration.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, has said in reference to the maximum, $1 million
deductibility, ``As long as I'm chairman, it's going to remain
where it is.''
   As if that weren't assurance enough, more than 100
representatives have endorsed a resolution ``that it is the sense
of the Congress that the current law regarding the Federal income
tax deduction for interest on debt secured by a first or second
home should not be further restricted.''
   So why worry? Because, say real estate and housing people, the
income tax deduction on home mortgage debt already has been limited
twice in the past three years. It can happen again, they say,
easily and quickly.
   Says Gribin: ``Just as the best time to put out a fire is before
it has a chance to really get started, the best time to defend
against a potentially disastrous piece of legislation is before it
garners a lot of support.''
   And Colton: ``The great concern is the foot in the door.'' Once
the barrier is lowered, he says, it can be lowered more easily in
the future, again and again until deductibility is eliminated
altogether.
   He has other reasons too. Unless the allowable deduction is cut
to a small fraction of the existing $1 million limit, he says, the
revenues produced would hardly be significant. He also contends
that whatever revenues are generated would be offset by those lost
through a decline in new-home construction.
   ``As long as the decision is made in full view of the American
public, the deductibility will be kept,'' he states. ``The trouble
is that a lot of deals are made in closed rooms.'' He wants to ward
off that possibility.
   Jeff Lubar, a Realtor spokesman, offers an even more succinct
explanation for having the troops on alert.
   Congress must be watched, he suggests, because ``all it takes is
a pen to scratch out one zero and $1 million goes to $100,000.''

   In 25 years on the force, city police Officer
Ray Chuderewicz has worked race riots and Vietnam War protests and
arrested drug pushers, rapists and car thieves.
   The 6-foot-1, 205-pound officer has gotten by with nary a
scratch until a militant, anti-abortion organization began waging
guerrilla warfare at women's clinics in Pittsburgh.
   Now Chuderewicz is on disability leave for several weeks,
recovering from surgery for a hernia he suffered during a February
protest while trying to arrest the local leader of Operation Rescue.
   ``It gets me a little bit ticked off,'' said Chuderewicz, 56,
who hasn't suffered a job-related injury since 1966. ``At the first
protest, I fell down and darn near rolled under a bus.''
   He is one of six city officers on long-term disability and one
of 50 officers who have been injured since June, when Operation
Rescue added three of the city's women's clinics to its
anti-abortion protest targets around the country.
   In less than a year, police Chief Ralph Pampena estimates more
than 1,330 abortion foes have been arrested, and the protests have
cost the police department roughly $100,000, including $30,000 in
compensation claims.
   Officials have become so frustrated they're considering using a
racketeering law against the protesters to recoup their costs.
   In Pittsburgh, as elsewhere, the group has turned demonstrations
into confrontations because protesters use whatever methods
possible _ including chaining themselves to doors _ to prevent
access to abortion clinics.
   Such tactics have clouded the issue, critics say.
   ``The tactics are becoming more important than the issue
itself,'' said Pampena. ``The issue now is between the police and
the demonstrators. It's no longer focused on the issue of
abortion.''
   But the Rev. Keith Tucci, the local leader of Operation Rescue,
said the group's methods are necessary to save lives.
   ``I genuinely feel bad that any police officer has been hurt.
That bothers me and I wish I could undo it. But children are dying.
That's the consequence,'' said Tucci, 32, of Penn Hills, who
resigned as pastor of his evangelical church to work full time for
the movement.
   Tucci argued that police have ``drawn themselves into this cross
fire'' by using excessive force with demonstrators. ``The treatment
is far rougher than needed.''
   In a demonstration, protesters use passive resistance _ going
limp and requiring police to carry them to paddy wagons _ in order
to delay their arrest and, in turn, delay possible abortions.
   Most of the injured officers' ailments involve back and groin
problems caused by lifting dozens of protesters, Pampena said.
   Hoping to save strain on his officers, the chief said he offered
demonstration leaders the option of having a person arrested every
45 seconds, the time it would take to carry someone away; those
arrested would have to cooperate by walking.
   ``That way they're still getting the same amount of time,
nobody's being harassed, nobody's being accused of brutality,''
Pampena said. ``But they refused. They said that's not in their
plan.''
   Tucci argued that protesters originally asked police for such an
agreement, but it was they who refused.
   Now, he said, Operation Rescue members are not as conciliatory
because many claim they've been victims of police brutality.
   ``After people have been beaten up and molested, I don't know
what incentive they have to get up and walk away now,'' he said.
   Once arrested, demonstrators often continue to use passive
resistance. On several occasions, they've tied up city courts for
hours and days by refusing to give their names, calling themselves
``Baby Does'' to identify with the children they say are being
murdered by abortion.
   Allegheny County Jail Warden Charles Kozakiewicz said the
county's expenses following a March 11 demonstration totaled more
than $15,000 because the activists withheld their names for 33
hours to protest assault charges lodged against one of their
members.
   Due to overcrowding at the jail, 60 women were held overnight in
the jail's gymnasium and 62 men were kept in police holding cells
until an unused building at Mayview State Hospital could be
prepared.
   Kozakiewicz said the women continued to remain limp upon arrival
at the jail, forcing guards to hold their heads erect for
photographing and drag them up five flights of steps to the
gymnasium.
   ``The whole process was time-consuming,'' the warden said.
``Some of the officers suffered injury. Some of these women _ how
can I say it? _ were large.''
   Operation Rescue organizers claim the women were fondled and
sexually harassed by jail guards and strip-searched by male guards.
   Kozakiewicz said he is troubled by those charges, saying the
women were treated with dignity and respect. He said female
corrections officers strip-searched only a few women, and the only
time male officers became involved was when women had to be dragged
upstairs to the gym.
   ``It's devastating because you put your best foot forward,'' he
said. ``Lord knows, they may have a champion in me in their cause.
But it's certainly frustrating to me to have to carry and drag
people in the jail. The point is not to be proved here.''
   Pampena said he has issued memos to police officers instructing
them to be as gentle as possible in dealing with protesters.
   ``We know we're not dealing with the criminal element and I have
no animosity toward them or their cause,'' he said. ``My police
officers are probably split 50-50 on the issue.''
   Officials at the abortion clinics say they are pleased with the
job police have done.
   Meanwhile, attorneys representing the building that houses the
Allegheny Reproductive Health Center have sued Operation Rescue,
Tucci and more than 40 other people, claiming they have harmed the
building's reputation among its 28 tenants and discouraged
potential tenants.
   The suit says the protesters violated the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act because their blockades
``constitute extortion and the interference with commerce by
threats or violence.''
   The county law department is investigating whether Pittsburgh
can apply the RICO act to recoup its costs of overtime, medical
treatment for police and housing prisoners arrested in
demonstrations.
   But Operation Rescue spokesman Nick Brough said neither lawsuits
nor restraining orders will stop the protests.
   ``They want us to run away in fear, but we cannot,'' Brough
said. ``We have made a promise to God that we won't be deterred,
whether by police brutality, tyrannical judges or unjust laws.''

   Having trouble getting your act together in time
to meet the April 17 income-tax deadline?
   Consider joining the 6 million or so of your fellow citizens who
are turning for help to Form 4868 (Application for Automatic
Extension of Time to File U.S. Indiviudual Income Tax Return).
   Complete this form properly, mail it to the Internal Revenue
Service, and you'll get four more months, until Aug. 15, to
complete your annual accounting with Uncle Sam.
   There's one catch to this, however. Extension of time to file
does not mean extension of time to pay.
   With Form 4868, the rules stipulate, you need to enclose a check
big enough to ensure that at least 90 percent of your eventual tax
bill for 1988 is paid.
   If you don't meet that standard, you can run into a wide variety
of woes, including penalties for late payment and a possible ruling
that invalidates your extension request altogether.
   So if you're uncertain how much your tax is likely to run, it
makes sense when estimating it to err on the high side.
   The trouble is, that means you're probably going to wind up
giving the government the free use of some of your money for at
least several months.
   Drawbacks notwithstanding, the IRS says 5.7 million taxpayers
filed for extensions in the tax filing season last year. For this
year, it is projecting that 6.2 million will do so.
   There used to be another way to duck the deadline, and to
postpone the need to pay as well.
   All you had to do was be out of the country, defined as the 50
states and Puerto Rico, on April 15. That qualified you for an
extra two months to file and pay.
   ``This was the easiest extension to get and particularly useful
to some taxpayers who were not in a position to determine what
their tax liability was going to be,'' observed Steven Holub,
managing partner in the Houston office of the accounting firm of
Laventhol &amp; Horwath.
   About a year ago, a clever thinker in an airline's marketing
department hit on the idea of promoting its flights to other
countries as a way of getting this break.
   But the idea was too clever in the eyes of the IRS, which
immediately began a crackdown. Now the only people eligible for the
extension are those who live outside the United States, including
members of the armed forces stationed in other lands.
   ``It eliminated a very handy device,'' Holub said.
   For people who will be traveling abroad this year, he adds, it
is now necessary either to get your return in on time or file a
Form 4868 before you depart.
   Some tax mavens advise getting an extension even if you can meet
the original deadline, as a way of reducing your chances of being
audited. No, say others, it is best to file in April, when there is
safety in numbers.
   Ignore this debate, counsels the Arthur Young Tax Guide: ``Both
theories are oversimplifications of IRS procedures.''

<HEAD>What Constitutes A Good Board? ^Eds: Fixes spelling of Zehnder in
grafs 17 and 19</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Asked what proportion of votes at corporate
board meetings are unanimous, 85 percent of a select group of
directors agreed that virtually all are.
   Because management generally selects or greatly influences the
issues on which votes are taken, and because most directors have
relatively little time to study board matters, the question arises
again: What good is a board?
   It is an ages-old question, asked over and over. Times change,
and the board's role evolves. But in spite of studies, conferences,
learned papers and the like, never has the issue been put to rest.
It probably never will be.
   Harold Geneen, former ITT chairman, has been quoted as saying a
board should sit in judgment of management, especially the chief
executive, ``and to reward, punish or replace the management as the
board sees fit.''
   But he added: ``That is what is supposed to happen. That is what
appears to happen. But it doesn't.'' And for good reason: As board
chairman, the chief generally is the one who selects members, and
the agenda as well.
   In recent years, boards have become more involved. And, because
of court suits and other evidence of shareholder suits, boards
today have a tendency to be more aware of their obligation to
shareholders.
   But the questions not only persist, they grow more numerous.
   For example, institutions have grown enormously in the past two
decades. Mutual funds and pension funds have become big owners of
stock, and on many days they dominate activity on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Question: Should such institutions have board seats?
   It's a good bet that the ordinary folks whose money makes up
these funds would be inclined to say ``yes,'' reasoning that they
are entitled to representation. But a lot of corporate executives
don't see it that way.
   In the same survey that indicated most board votes are unanimous
_ by Egon Zehnder International, a consulting firm _ only 12 of 102
directors thought institutions should be represented.
   In fact, many of the directors interviewed, all of whom serve
very large corporations and 60 percent of whom are chief executives
of other companies, consider institutional influence a growing
danger to corporate governance.
   Underscoring that view, 50 percent of them agreed with the
statement, ``The power of institutional investors in corporate
governance is growing out of proportion and something should be
done about it.''
   Said one: ``Institutional investors don't belong on corporate
boards _ they're only concerned with quick profits, not the
long-term health of the corporation.''
   Who then is concerned with long-term health, management or
insiders? Outsiders, such as widely knowledgeable educators or
chief executives of other companies? Outsiders who own shares?
Outsiders who own little or no stock?
   You may have strong views on those questions, but chances are
that your views are offset by others with equally strong but
opposite opinions.
   In the Zehnder survey, four of 10 directors opposed the seating
of insiders. While acknowledging the valuable hands-on experience
of corporate officers, one of the directors contended:
   ``Since it is only human nature to want to save your own job,
management who serve on boards cannot be expected to have the best
interests of the shareholders in mind in takeover situations.''
   Representatives of small shareholders have long argued at annual
meetings that all board members should own stock in the company,
and most of the directors in the Zehnder survey agreed.
   They suggested, however, that stock ownership is not a
requirement for being a good director. Seven in 10 agreed that
directors are likely to have the same commitment to shareholder
interests regardless of their equity holdings.
   You may disagree, as millions of others disagree. It is the
reason why the issue of what makes a good board might never get
settled.

<HEAD>After 70 Years, Organization Finds Problems Harder to Solve</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Back in the 1920s, the leaders of the
fledgling League of Women Voters raised cash by hocking their rings
and pearls at a friendly Washington pawn shop.
   The shop's operator held the goods until the organization was on
its feet and the ladies of the league had the cash to redeem their
valuables. Or so goes the story, oft told by the officers of
today's League of Women Voters.
   At 70, the league finds the solutions to its problems more
difficult to come by.
   The non-partisan league, dedicated still to promoting political
and civic activism, is working to reverse a decline in members and
end the financial squeeze that has forced it to draw from its
endowment to cover operating losses.
   It has cut expenses, laid off staff, reduced its lobbying
efforts and de-emphasized a range of issues it was active in yet
distracted by.
   Aggravating the deficit was last fall's presidential debate
debacle, which culminated when the league angrily withdrew its
sponsorship of the final debate between George Bush and Michael
Dukakis in a dispute over format and details.
   That move generated much sympathy around the country but renewed
and intensified hostility toward the league among partisans of both
parties.
   Yet, the troubles facing the League of Women Voters run deeper.
   It is in some ways a victim of the success and achievement of a
generation of active, educated and assertive women _ like the ones
who hocked their jewels to pay the bills _ and of the social change
that has moved women away from volunteer work to jobs that pay.
   ``The woman who was the heart and soul of the league volunteer
is now an investment banker,'' says Grant P. Thompson, the league's
first male executive director.
   To meet the changing social and financial demands, the
organization's board of trustees agreed in January to a long-term
refocusing of the league's efforts. Its top priorities now are
public campaign financing and a project called ``Advocate for the
Voter,'' which aims at increasing voter registration and turnout.
   The move essentially was a return to the sort of issues that
concerned the league when it sprang from the women's suffrage
movement in 1919.
   ``Our goals are the same, but the strategies to reach them are
going to have to change,'' says Nancy M. Neuman, the league's
national president. ``We've got to accommodate people who have very
busy and complicated lives, but who still want to be active and try
to change things.''
   The league's strength is its 1,150 local organizations in
communities in every state, where members monitor obscure
government proceedings, promote voter registration and push league
positions on a plethora of concerns.
   Some have seen that wide range of issues as a problem.
   ``A blue million of 'em,'' former league president Dorothy
Ridings says of the issues the league has tried to deal with: arms
control, abortion, clean water, defense spending, child care,
housing and tax reform to name a few.
   ``Over the years, we've simply tried to become all things to all
people. With the best of intentions, but it's stretched us thinner
and thinner,'' said Ridings, now publisher of the Bradenton (Fla.)
Herald.
   The league describes its own positions as progressive. Some say
they are liberal.
   ``While they say they're non-partisan, they tend to support
positions that most clearly follow Democratic lines,'' says Frank
Fahrenkopf, the former Republican national chairman who tangled
with the league over the debates. ``They're basically liberal.''
   The league is strictly bound to its grass-roots orientation _ so
much so that it didn't even have a reliable national membership
list when Thompson was hired four years ago.
   Since then, the league has spent heavily on modernization,
bringing computers into the operation and installing its first
modern financial system.
   The financing problems are real. Budgets for the league and its
educational fund have fallen over the last decade; corporate
donations are down, and the league has spent $1 million over the
last several years from its reserves, now at about $1.5 million.
   Thompson says last year's losses, including those from the
debate fiasco, will hit about $800,000. With cost controls, he
hopes the league will end its fiscal year with a deficit of
$200,000 to $400,000 on an operating budget of $6.8 million.
   To control costs, the league in January dismissed two workers,
one a lobbyist on Capitol Hill; left vacancies unfilled, and cut
back its publications.
   Officials acknowledge that the changes, particularly the
de-emphasis on selected issues, have created tensions between
headquarters and members.
   Years of declining membership _ despite the acceptance of men as
members in 1974 _ is another problem.
   Membership grew 10 percent last year, reversing a decade of
decline, due primarily to a new but costly direct-mail campaign to
solicit members. Thompson says mailings cost as much as the dues
they brought in; the payoff will come only if those members renew.
   Membership in the still-predominately female organization
reached a peak of about 150,000 in the mid-1970s and is now about
107,000.
   Of all its problems and controversies, the biggest controversy
by far was over the debates.
   The league has sponsored presidential debates since 1976.
Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats were happy with the way
the debates had been run and before the 1988 campaign formed the
Commission on Presidential Debates to serve as a rival sponsor.
   The league sponsored two debates during the primary season, but
two more fell through when candidates backed out. The campaigns
agreed to let the league sponsor one of two presidential debates in
the fall, but Neuman angrily withdrew the organization's
sponsorship 11 days before the event, saying the Bush and Dukakis
campaigns were trying to stifle spontaneity.
   The dispute turned bitter.
   The league said it would turn over the debate site, the Shrine
Auditorium in Los Angeles, to the new sponsors for $90,000 _ twice
the amount it had put down. Then, the party commission charged the
league hadn't even put down a deposit on the building until it
announced plans to withdraw.
   The commission said that amounted to holding the auditorium
``hostage.'' The new sponsors found a new _ and rent-free _ site.
   ``A lot of the people on both the Republican and Democrat sides
who had to work with the league in past debates found them very,
very difficult to work with,'' Fahrenkopf said.
   ``The league spent all its time hustling money and using it for
their fundraising; it almost became, the only thing the league
existed for any more was to hold the debates,'' Fahrenkopf charged.
   League officials say they asked for the extra money to cover
contracts for sets and lighting, and said it paid more to withdraw
from the debates than it would have to let them proceed.
   The debate issue hangs over the league still, as it looks to
what Neuman sees as a bright future. It will continue to sponsor
local debates in 1990, and Neuman says the league will propose
presidential debates in 1992.
   ``Until then,'' she says, ``we will be working to ensure that
the American public is never again force-fed a campaign as mediocre
and as patronizing as this one.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It's another question of whether the feds should
tell the states what to do and, if so, who should foot the bill?
This time the debate is about the quality of day care for children,
and when kids are involved emotions run high. More than two dozen
child-care bills are now before Congress while President Bush has
some ideas of his own.

   A baby sitter recently saved the lives of
eight young children by tossing them from the window of her burning
apartment to the arms of rescuers three stories below.
   There was heroism in the tale, but it also raised some questions.
   Should one person have been looking after eight children ranging
in age from 5 months to 3 years? Were the children getting the
individual attention considered vital to healthy child development?
Even more basic, was the situation safe? And who's to blame for day
care that is abusive, hazardous, emotionally damaging or
intellectually barren?
   Day care for children traditionally has been regulated by the
individual states. Now Congress is debating whether to enact
minimum federal standards and force states to toe the line.
   No fewer than two dozen child-care bills are pending on Capitol
Hill, with advocates of federal regulation insisting that some
states simply are not doing a proper job.
   The controversy over federal encroachment on the turf of the
states was a major factor holding up child-care legislation last
year and the fireworks promise to be equally as lively this year.
   Are states doing the job?
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who is leading a National Governors
Association push for federal incentives instead of requirements,
says, ``The record reflects a significant effort in most states to
improve child-care standards.''
   But officials of the Children's Defense Fund maintain there are
wide discrepancies in the standards from state to state. In some
states, for example, a single adult cannot care for more than three
infants. But in Idaho, a new mandatory licensing system
theoretically permits one person to care for 12 infants.
   ``The states that are generally moving forward are the ones that
weren't in such bad shape to begin with,'' says Helen Blank, day
care director for the CDF. ``But we still have a situation where in
many states licensing standards don't give children the protection
they need to grow up safe _ much less give them a good
developmental experience.
   ``The bottom line is that a few states have gone backwards. In
some states, what they call progress makes you a little
uncomfortable.''
   Meanwhile, President Bush is pushing for a tax break for
low-income families with young children, on the premise that it
gives parents a choice. One parent can decide to stay home or the
family can use the money for the child care of their choice.
   Bush's plan presumes that parents don't want or need federal
intrusion in the day care field. Any federal requirements would
decrease the supply of care and infringe on parental choice,
backers of the plan contend.
   But some parents have told Congress they always assumed the
government regulated child care until tragedy struck their family.
And experts contend that most parents aren't qualified to judge day
care _ and why should they have to?
   ``We don't ask restaurant patrons to inspect the kitchen for
violations,'' says Dr. Sue Aronson, a child-care consultant who
teaches pediatrics at Hahneman University in Philadelphia.
   There is little disagreement among experts over ideal day care
conditions for children. Some are physical, such as requiring
staffers to frequently wash their hands to prevent the spread of
infectious disease, providing immunizations, fire extinguishers and
enough adults on hand to get infants and young toddlers to safety
in an emergency.
   Then there is quality _ ``warm, positive, individual, one-to-one
interactions between adults and children,'' as described by Dr. Sue
Bredekamp, director of professional development at the National
Association for the Education of Young Children.
   Such interactions have a long-term effect on language,
self-esteem, social development and intellectual competence, she
says. Her group has identified three factors that most influence
the quality of day care interactions: group size, the
staff-to-child ratio, and staff training.
   The federal government operates dozens of day care centers for
its employees across the country and overseas, and many agencies
without centers are now making on-sight child care a priority.
   The Learning Center at the General Services Administration in
Washington meets or betters nearly all standards recommended by
professional groups and is serving as a model for that movement.
   Director Pam Simon says other centers send their teachers to
observe the staff and organizers come to find out how to set up
centers at their agencies. ``We get people coming to look at us all
the time,'' she said.
   Bredekamp of the NAEYC says proper training might have averted
the recent death of a 9-month-old infant whose nanny banged her
head against the wall because she would not stop crying. ``We must
face the very real possibility that the nanny did not know any
better,'' she says.
   Training not only can prevent child abuse but also enables
care-givers to help children grow and learn, she says. ``Our goal
is not that children just survive child care. We want and need for
them to thrive in child care.''
   To that end, she says, 20 preschoolers and two adults is far
superior to 40 kids and four adults in terms of noise level,
psychological space and opportunities for individual interactions
with adults and other children. And, she says, one adult for every
three or four infants is critical if babies are to be adequately
held, rocked, comforted and protected from physical harm.
   Even states with relatively stringent regulations often fall
short of standards recommended by professionals.
   Only 15 states meet NAEYC guidelines for infant ratios and group
size. Only five meet the guidelines for toddlers and 10 for
preschoolers. Nearly half don't require any training or experience
of day care teachers.
   On the health and safety front, about half the states don't have
specific day care center hand-washing requirements, according to a
forthcoming study by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the
American Public Health Association.
   The federally funded study, meant to be a comparative report
card for states, also has found that only 6 percent require that
center children be immunized for meningitis. And only 18 percent
require energy absorbing surfaces below climbing equipment,
although one-half to two-thirds of all injuries occur on
playgrounds.

   Many state legislatures have agreed to some minimum standards,
but have balked at more stringent regulations urged by some
agencies.
   In Idaho, for example, the state has just instituted a mandatory
licensing system _ its first. But while the new law requires fire
and health inspections and criminal history checks, it doesn't
require any education or training of staff members. The staff-child
ratio is 1 to 12, regardless of the ages of the children. Staffers
watching no more than six kids are not regulated at all.
   ``The law is less strict than our regulations were under the
previous law,'' says Perry Ackerman, child care licensing
coordinator for the state. ``But that was voluntary. There wasn't
any penalty for being unlicensed.''
   Is that progress?
   ``We lost a lot in the area of quality,'' Ackerman replies.
``But we got a mandatory law after eight or nine attempts. I guess
it's progress.''
   In Texas, regulations for the state's 14,000-plus family day
care homes are about to be revised. Under the current system, the
only qualification for care-givers is that they be 18 years old.
And they can watch up to 12 children, depending on their ages. One
mix allows one adult to care for four infants and two toddlers.
Another permits six young children and six school-age siblings.
   While Texas requires centers to be licensed, its much weaker
registration system for day care homes was highlighted by toddler
Jessica McClure's well-publicized tumble into an abandoned well
shaft. With six children in her care, the baby sitter thought she
didn't need to register with the state. She was wrong.
   But even if she had registered, the state would have done no
more than run checks for a criminal record or reports of child
abuse. No one would have visited the house and discovered the well
shaft in the yard.
   ``It's providing a false sense of security to parents,'' says
Cris Ros-Dukler, the state's assistant commissioner for licensing.
   Ros-Dukler says she has unsuccessfully sought money to put teeth
in the registration process. An attempt two years ago to limit
family day care homes to six children ``got nowhere,'' she says.
Hopes for change at this point turn on raising the minimum
care-giver age to 21 and requiring training both before and after
becoming a provider.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Delaware upgraded family day
care in 1985 and just completed an overhaul of center regulations.
The ratio now is one staffer to four infants. Health and safety
requirements are much more stringent. Care-givers now must
participate in 15 hours of training a year and expose children to a
range of daily activities appropriate to their age.
   What does Delaware have that Texas doesn't? A healthier economy,
for one thing, and a less-hostile attitude toward regulation.
   ``You really have to determine what is the community standard
that is going to be acceptable,'' says Pauline Koch, Delaware's
director of licensing services.
   Gwen Morgan, a professor at Wheelock College in Boston and
author of the ``The National State of Child-Care Regulation,''
doesn't agree that federal standards are the answer.
   ``I'm amenable to one federal standard: infant care,'' she says.
``I'm convinced that a one to seven infant ratio can have extremely
harmful effects.''
   The dangers, she says, include borderline retardation from lack
of stimulation; increased spread of infectious disease, and the
sheer physical impossibility of exiting a building quickly with
seven infants.
   The federal government should otherwise stay out of the mandate
business unless they are willing to fork over $20 billion to $30
billion to help parents and states pay for the upgraded care,
Morgan says.
   The nation's governors agree. They are proposing the development
of national model standards on everything from nutrition and safety
to staff size, training and parental involvement, and seeking
federal financial incentives for states to upgrade their systems.
   ``If the states have incentive grants and after a few years you
can show me people still doing things that are certifiably bad for
kids, then I personally will be glad to take another look at this
federal standards issue,'' Clinton says.
   Model standards have failed to influence states in the past, and
hard-liners hold little hope of progress _ even with a federal
carrot. ``In some states there is such strong opposition to making
improvements that money incentives will not work,'' says Blank, the
Children's Defense Fund day care director.
   Blank and her allies note that the states must meet a variety of
conditions to get federal money for Head Start, school lunches,
nursing homes, highways and anti-pollution projects. So why not day
care?
   ``Taxpayers do not want their tax dollars used to place babies
and children in dangerous situations,'' says Joyce Strom, deputy
director of the Child Welfare League of America.
   But Clinton says mandatory child-care standards would be like
mandatory elementary school standards. ``We have smaller class
requirements now in Arkansas,'' he says. ``It's very expensive,
it's very controversial and it's very good for at-risk kids. I'm
glad we did it, but I wouldn't recommend it as a national
standard.''
   The debate at the Clinton household, half a continent away from
the talk on Capitol Hill, has a familiar ring. For while Clinton
has been designated lead governor in the NGA bid to discourage
mandated national standards, his wife Hillary is chairman of the
Children's Defense Fund _ the fiercest standards champion of all.
   ``If it was just the two of us, I think we could work it out,''
Clinton said with a laugh. ``But it's not.''

<HEAD>``Drifting Away'' From Reagan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The critics call it drift, and maybe they're
right. But there certainly is a prevailing current in the early
course of the Bush administration _ and it leads away from some of
the policies and positions bequeathed by Ronald Reagan.
   President Bush has made those moves carefully and quietly, item
by item. He is putting his imprint on major programs, supplanting
and in some cases undoing Reagan policies, transformations that
have been taking place with scant notice and only a few complaints
from conservatives.
   That's just fine with the White House. Bush and his lieutenants
need no trouble on the Republican right, where the president never
was a favorite. Most of the criticism has been coming from other
directions, much of it from Democrats.
   Still, there are some ripples on the right. When Republican
National Chairman Lee Atwater spoke at the Heritage Foundation the
other night, one man complained that Bush has moved away from some
favored conservative positions since the election.
   ``George Bush is a conservative,'' Atwater replied. He said on
two paramount issues, opposition to new taxes and a hard line
against communism, Bush is solid and absolute. ``He remains hard
core on both of those,'' the GOP chairman said.
   Bush denies that his administration is adrift. Challenging those
who complain about the pace of administration action, he said in
Houston last month:
   ``In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye _ or
makes the headlines. The proof will come when we look back from the
year 2000.''
   He's also countered by joking about the criticism. ``People say
I'm indecisive,'' he said last week. Presidential pause. ``I don't
know about that.''
   ``Some started saying that the White House didn't have an
agenda,'' said Vice President Dan Quayle. ``We have an agenda. It's
just that when Ronald Reagan left, he took it with him.''
   Jokes aside, if Reagan came back, he may not recognize some of
that agenda.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, who served both
men, says the Reagan-to-Bush revisions are in approach, not in
goals. He says they differ at the margin, not on the basics.
   From the outset, Bush has said he envisioned no radical change
in course from the administration he served as vice president.
   Nevertheless, some Reagan positions have been retired since he
did.
   Bush's agreement with the Democrats on aid to the Nicaraguan
Contra rebels is a prime example. The administration has agreed to
seek only non-military aid, only through next February and subject
to congressional committee veto. Since Congress has rejected
military aid, the net result is similar to what Reagan got. But
administration policy now is to seek diplomatic answers in Central
America, rather than look to military ones.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who negotiated the deal
with Congress, acknowledged the failure of Reagan policy. ``We all
have to admit that the policy failed to some extent because we were
not united,'' he said. ``We had an executive branch going in one
direction and a Congress going in the other.''
   On the domestic agenda, the Bush administration has embraced a
compromise version of a bill _ which Reagan pocket vetoed _ to
protect federal employees who blow the whistle on waste, abuse and
mismanagement. The compromise might have satisfied Reagan; he never
said.
   The Reagan administration opposed any increase in the $3.35
hourly minimum wage. The Bush administration has endorsed an
increase, tied to a lower-than-minimum training wage for new
workers. Congressional Democrats want a higher minimum and a more
restricted training wage. That's still in dispute and the
administration has talked of a veto unless there is a satisfactory
compromise.
   Bush also has moved away from the Reagan position on the
question of gun controls, which also was his own _ a flat no. The
administration on Wednesday widened its import ban on foreign-made
assault rifles, and an official said it is considering a proposal
that gun buyers register such weapons.
   Even those modest moves drew the standard protests from the gun
lobby, despite the growing sense of crisis over drug-related
violence in American cities and the murder of five children in a
Stockton, Calif., schoolyard.
   Atwater told his conservative audience that Bush remains opposed
to gun control despite the moves against assault rifles, on which
he said there is growing public sentiment in favor of limits.
   ``If the conservative position is pro-assault rifle, you'd
better get out and start moving around'' to hear the public outcry,
Atwater said.

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Heartbeat of New Orleans</HEAD>
<UNK>By LYNNE BERNSTEIN ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They're called the ``heartbeat of New Orleans.''
   And in music circles, the Neville Brothers are known as
``musician's musicians.''
   For over 30 years, the Neville name has been synonymous with all
the traditions of the Crescent city. Their sound is culled from a
gumbo of styles _ jazz, Caribbean, African, Cajun, rock, funk _
resulting in music as distinctive as New Orleans itself. Charles
Neville, who plays saxophone, calls it New Orleans rhythm and blues.
   The brothers _ Art, Aaron, Charles and Cyril _ worked
individually for more than two decades before they finally merged
their diverse talents in 1977. After several albums and a two-year
interlude, the band has just released their new album, ``Yellow
Moon.''
   The collection, including eight original songs, is perhaps their
most political and personal album, one in which they express their
concern for social issues.
   The album's first single, ``Sister Rosa,'' is a tribute to Rosa
Parks, who became one of the catalysts for the civil rights
movement in 1955 when she refused to give up her seat for a white
person on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Ala. The rap-reggae
number, written and performed by percussionist Cyril, reflects the
album's overall theme: to educate people by increasing their
awareness.
   ``If you don't learn from history, it tends to repeat itself
because it can definitely happen again,'' said Art, the keyboardist.
   ``Look at the neo-nazis and Skinheads,'' added Cyril, wearing a
``Stop Apartheid'' button. ``We want to give youth a chance to look
at each other on their own terms, rather than how it was in the
last generation who had a certain amount of fear and hatred pumped
into them before they got a chance to look at people and decide for
themselves.
   ``We want to convey to youth that they don't have to be
superhuman or smart to make a change for the better in the world.''
   ``My Blood,'' another song by Cyril, speaks about the roots of
oppression, with particular mention of South Africans, Haitians and
native Americans.
   There's also a remake of Sam Cooke's ``A Change Is Gonna Come,''
and two Bob Dylan covers, ``The Ballad of Hollis Brown'' and ``With
God on Our Side.'' Although Aaron and Cyril trade off as lead
vocalists on most of the album, Art gets the chance to belt out
``Fire and Brimstone'' with the same enthusiasm he seems to have
for life in general. Charles is heard prominently on the
instrumental ``Healing Chant.''
   There is a tenuous and harmonious thread to ``Yellow Moon,''
partly due to producer Daniel Lanois' (Peter Gabriel, U2) recording
style. He used a New Orleans apartment instead of a studio.
   ``His method of recording is to build the studio around the
artist, rather than force the artist to conform to some existing
environment,'' Charles said.
   ``The nickname for the studio became `the swamp,''' Cyril said
with a laugh. ``A whole atmosphere was created which you are able
to hear on the record.''
   Jonathan Demme (``Something Wild,'' ``Married to the Mob'')
directed the video for ``Sister Rosa.'' The filmmaker shares the
musicians' interest in Haiti. After working with artists there and
hearing Cyril sing ``My Blood,'' Demme wanted American artists to
go to Haiti to perform.
   ``But he didn't want it to be like a Sun City,'' said Cyril,
referring to the so-called integrated music venue in South Africa.
``He wanted people with more similar roots and backgrounds.'' The
brothers and Demme are working on a video with the Haitian band Les
Freres Parent.
   The brothers' musical roots go back to the '50s. Art was part of
the Hawkettes in 1954 when they recorded the legendary New Orleans
anthem, ``Mardi Gras Mambo.'' In the 1970s, he helped form the
Meters, a funk group with great impact on fellow musicians and such
new bands as The Police.
   Charles was busy touring with Big Mac Bell, Bobby ``Blue'' Bland
and B.B. King. Aaron had a Top 10 hit in 1967 with ``Tell It Like
It Is.'' Cyril was involved in his own band before he joined Art
with the Meters in Europe, who were touring with the Rolling Stones.
   When Charles and Aaron joined the Meters to record ``The Wild
Tchoupitoulas'' album, it was the first time in years the brothers
had all played together.
   ``It happened so easily and beautifully, and we were so proud of
the finished product,'' said Cyril. So they decided to form the
Neville Brothers.
   Although their popularity stems from their hometown of New
Orleans, they initially didn't have a large following as a group.
   ``We used to play Tipitina's. You could blow it up and get no
one but the Neville Brothers,'' Art recalled. ``But we're just
enjoying it as it happens.'' Tipitina's is a popular New Orleans
music hall, and was featured in the film ``The Big Easy'' along
with The Neville Brothers music.
   After the release of their first album, ``The Neville
Brothers,'' the group took off. Their 1981 ``Fiyo on the Bayou''
was a critical and commercial success. Rolling Stones guitarist
Keith Richards called it the best album of that year. But their
1987 ``Uptown'' didn't quite make it. Even devoted fans felt it was
an attempt at mass appeal. ``Yellow Moon'' should dispel any doubts
of the brothers' integrity.
   A Cinemax special in May will include such guests as Bonnie
Raitt, Gregg Allman, Buckwheat Zydeco, Jimmy Buffett, John Hiatt
and TV journalist Ed Bradley who will perform ``Sixty Minute Man''
with the Brothers. Bradley is one of many fans who has danced with
wild abandon at a Neville Brothers concert. ``Our music is
definitely dance music. That's the way to respond to it,'' said
Charles. ``The same energy we put out is recycled through the
audience. In a place with no dance floor, there's less energy
coming back from the audience.''

<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tanker Exxon Valdez was freed
Wednesday from the reef that ripped its hull and spilled more than
10 million gallons of crude oil, and Alaska's governor asked the
Coast Guard to take over the cleanup from Exxon.
   Elsewhere, the captain of the Exxon Valdez surrendered to police
and was ordered held on $1 million bond.
   Cleanup crews continued to skim mayonnaise-thick oil from Prince
William Sound, but progress was slow and the oil had spread over an
area larger than Delaware. The animal death toll rose and salmon
hatcheries remained endangered.
   In Juneau, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper said he asked Coast Guard
Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr. to take over the much-maligned and
slowly progressing cleanup effort from Exxon, and Nelson indicated
he would, although he has not formally approved the request.
   Cowper said the Coast Guard should be better able to handle
coordination and management of the cleanup than Exxon, which he
said was too bureaucratic.
   ``Maybe that's been the problem all along. You need a military
system to get things done,'' the governor said.
   ``We appreciate the efforts of Exxon _ we think they were done
in good faith. But we think there has to be a much more disciplined
management structure,'' Cowper said at a Capitol news conference.
   President Bush earlier had sent a team of high-level officials
to Valdez and determined that federal management of the cleanup
wasn't necessary. Cowper said Coast Guard management is different
from the plan Bush rejected.
   Although Cowper said he didn't want to be ``extremely critical''
of Exxon, a letter sent to the Coast Guard by a state environmental
official said Exxon had been unresponsive.
   ``Exxon has failed to provide ... the information necessary to
make sound planning recommendations regarding the cleanup of oil
and the protection of resources,'' wrote Lynn Kent, chief of the
state Oil and Hazardous Substance Spill Response Section.
   Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company disagreed with
charges it wasn't handling the cleanup properly and thought Exxon
was the best organization to manage the effort.
   ``We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup. We
think the most effective and efficient way to carry out this
project is (for Exxon) to continue,'' Beathard said.
   Fired tanker captain Joseph Hazelwood, 42, surrendered to police
on New York's Long Island and a judge set bail at $1 million bond
or $500,000 in cash, up from a prosecutor's recommendation of
$25,000. He had been sought since Saturday on a fugitive warrant on
misdemeanor charges of operating the tanker while drunk.
   ``These misdemeanors are of such a magnitude that has never been
equaled, at least in this country,'' Judge Kenneth Rohl said as
Hazelwood was arraigned. ``He's got to think about that. We have a
manmade destruction that has not been equaled, probably, since
Hiroshima.''
   Salvage crews pumped compressed air into the $125 million ship
and floated it off Bligh Reef, 25 miles from the port of Valdez.
From there, it began a 30-mile journey under the control of six
tugs to a remote cove off Naked Island for temporary repairs,
picking its way through scattered icebergs.
   ``No pollution was immediately visible. There's a real good
possibility (oil) sheen will show up, but they're ready for it,''
Coast Guard spokesman Rick Meidt said.
   The ship was refloated at 10:35 a.m., hours before the tide
reached its peak Wednesday.
   ``It was not just a stroke of good luck,'' said Gary Gorski,
Exxon's salvage coordinator. ``It took a lot of hard work.''
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi said the company has
talked with dry docks in South Korea, Japan and Singapore about
accepting the vessel after the temporary repairs are made.
   First choice is a Portland, Ore., dry dock, Iarossi said, but
Oregon officials have raised concerns about accepting the ship.
Iarossi said the ship won't trail any pollution while it is towed.
   Oil has floated over 2,600 square miles, soiled 800 miles of
beach and killed thousands of animals, including at least 30 sea
otters, officials said.
   ``Dozens of otters are dying before rescuers can get to them,''
said fish and game spokesman Jon Lyman.
   Favorable weather, however, has kept it offshore from a national
park and additional coastline outside Prince William Sound.
   Flow through the Alaskan pipeline returned to its normal daily
flow of 2.1 million barrels Wednesday, the Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. said. Oil flow from the North Slope had been cut by 60 percent
because the spill restricted tanker traffic in Valdez harbor, but
traffic has increased.
   In Washington, Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine accused
the federal government of covering up the possibility of a major
spill and the ineffectiveness of cleanup technology. The California
Democrats also asked President Bush to cancel oil leasing off the
California coast pending a review of the program.
   Hazelwood turned himself in with three attorneys in Hauppauge,
N.Y., and was arraigned. His lawyer said he had not decided whether
to waive extradition proceedings and return to Alaska to face the
charges.
   Hazelwood is charged with operating a ship while under the
influence of alcohol, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge
of oil. The charges carry a combined maximum penalty of 2\ years in
prison and a $10,000 fine.
   FBI officials in Washington say they also are investigating
whether Hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the
Clean Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants
into navigable waters.
   Hazelwood was fired by Exxon a week ago after the National
Transportation Safety Board said tests taken about nine hours after
the disaster showed he was drunk.
   Hazelwood had been arrested twice for drunken driving and had
his license suspended three times. His mother has told The
Associated Press that her son had undergone rehabilitation and that
Exxon was aware of his drinking problem.
   Exxon said it has changed its policy because of the spill and
now requires crews to be aboard ship, where drinking is prohibited,
four hours before sailing.
   One hundred claims have been filed with the company for damages,
including 40 on Tuesday alone. The claims have come mostly from
fishermen. Exxon has settled only two so far. At least 14 lawsuits
have been filed.

<HEAD>Analysts: Lorenzo Profits Likely From Any Eastern Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF AWALT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Any sale of strike-crippled Eastern Airlines
could eventually hurt the airline and sister carrier Continental
Airlines, but Texas Air Corp. and its chairman, Frank Lorenzo, may
reap millions, analysts say.
   Some analysts believe a sale of Eastern's assets and other
advantages Lorenzo has gained during Texas Air's three years of
ownership of the airline would produce a sizable profit despite
Eastern's heavy losses and long list of creditors. Texas Air bought
Eastern in 1986 for $600 million.
   ``Our position is that he'll come out of the deal all right as
far as Eastern is concerned, but what we are concerned about in the
long term is these airlines' continuing position in the industry,''
Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst for Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia, said Wednesday.
   ``I still think there was a potential (merger) there between
Continental and Eastern that could have made a viable carrier in
the '90s. But I think either one of these carriers by themselves
may have a hard row to hoe in the future,'' Marckesano said.
   An investor group headed by former baseball commisoner Peter
V. Ueberroth reportedly was in the fdnesday of
negotiations to buy Eastern from Texas Air, but the deal hit a snag.
   Texas Air agreed last week to sell Eastern's prized Northeast
shuttle operation to New York developer Donald J. Trump for $355
million.
   Analysts said that since Eastern is in bankruptcy reorganizd has creditors
waiting to collect millions, it's still hard to
gauge just how much Texas Air would gain from ae.
   Any Eastern sale would hto be approved by the airline's
unsecured creditors committee, which includes rntatives of
the Eastern unions, and by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland.
   But Marckesano estimates that Houston-based Texas Air could see
an overall profit of more than $100 million from its three-year
ownership, based on expected proceeds from the sale of Eastern and
from revenues received during its ownership.
   That gain would be on top of the increased value of Ehat Texas Air
acquired from the airline, such as the former
Eastern computerized reservation sys merged with
Continental's to form System One. The system is used by many travel
agencies.
   ``The immediate impact will be that Mr. Lorenzo will get someh out
of it, and I fully expect that, whatever fale
takes, that will be the case,'' said Robertn airline
analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. in Ch
   The amount of profit for Texas Air will depend partly on whether
a buyout includes assumptern's debts, Decker said.
   It also was uncether Lorenzo would use any such profit
to strengthen Continental, which lost $258.1 million in 1987 and
$315.5 million in 1988.
   Continentave Messing declined to comment Wednesday
on thtial effects of an Eastern sale. Texas Air spokesman
Art Kent did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
   Some experts said that even if an Eastern sale raised money to
help pay off Texas Air debt, it might not go too far in helping the
company's remaining operations.
   ``Continental is pretty debt-ridden themselves,'' said Severin
Borenstein, an airst and economist at the University of
Michigan. ``It doesn't look like they're going to start reporting
in the soon, and unless they eventually turn things
around they may nlong for this world.''
   Marckesano also cast doubts on Continental's future.
   ``Just to keep up with wha in companies like Delta
or American or Northwest, where they have $10 (billion) to $20
billion worth of equipt on order, is going to be extremely
difficult,'' Marckesano said.
   ``With Eastern gone maybe they will concentrate on pouring
capital into Continental,'' he said. ``But I don't have much
confidence in the surviving management of Texas Air that they will
do the right thing to make Continental a strong competitor in the
future.''

<HEAD>Shell, Chevron Limit Wholesale Gasoline Deliveries Due To Alaska
Spill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATIA BLACKBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two major oil companies have limited gasoline
deliveries to wholesale distributors in Western states in what one
spokesman called the first U.S. gas rationing since the Arab oil
embargo of the early 1970s.
   Spokesmen for Shell Oil Co. and Chevron Corp. said Wednesday
that the rationing was to prevent the hoarding of gasoline in the
wake of the Alaska oil spill.
   Shell spokesman Bill Gibson in Houston, Texas, said in a
telephone interview that is was the first gasoline rationing he
could recall since the Arab oil embargo of 1973-74.
   Gibson said Shell's decision to put a cap on its deliveries to
wholesalers in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Utah, Nevada
and Arizona was a result of excessive buying by those distributors
in the last week.
   ``Some of our Western regional (wholesalers) began buying
excessive amounts of gasoline last week, and this (program) is
strictly in response to that,'' said Gibson, adding he didn't have
specific purchase details immediately available.
   He denied Shell's ``supply management program'' was put into
effect because of shortages in crude supplies.
   He said most of the crude for West Coast Shell refineries,
located at Anacortes, Wash., Martinez, Calif., and Los Angeles,
comes from sources other than Alaska.
   The decision to limit sales to 90 percent of the gasoline the
wholesalers purchased in April 1988 went into effect Monday and
will remain until Shell decides it's no longer necessary, he said.
   He said he did not know why Shell chose 90 percent as its figure.
   The wholesalers rushed to purchase gasoline after the tanker
Exxon Valdez slammed into rocks in Alaska's Prince William Sound on
March 24, dumping more than 10 million gallons of crude in what
became the nation's worst oil spill.
   Chevron began its rationing just three days after the accident
in anticipation of stepped-up gasoline purchases, said company
spokesman Mike Libbey in San Francisco.
   On March 27, Chervon began to limit deliveries to 100 percent of
contract agreements to make sure there'd be enough gasoline to go
around, Libbey said.
   The cost of gasoline in the Seattle area has climbed about 8
cents a gallon in the last three weeks, the biggest hikes having
occurred since the spill.
   Gibson would not comment on whether the 90 percent allotments
helped to increase wholesale and gasoline-pump prices.
   But Libbey said it was clear that the Valdez spill translated
into a 4-cent to 7-cent hike in Chevron's price per gallon to
retailers.
   Major West oast refineries rely heavily on Alaska oil to masoline and
other products. The pipeline from Alah Slope
to Valdez usually carries 2 million barrels of crude a day, but
that was reduced to 800,000 barrels a day after the spill limited
tanker loadings at the port.
   Cclaimed to have no problem with crude supplies to
its major Wesst refineries, in the San Francisco and Los
Angeles areas.
  `Chevron hasn't had to limit refinery activity at all,'' Libbey. ``I
gather from what I hear that the independents (smaller
oil companies) are squeezed more tightly than we a they
don't have the resources we have and room to maneuver.''
   Exxon in Houston said it would not be able to provide
infomation on whether it has a similar gasoline dist effect until sometime
today, and information from other major
il companies wasn't immediately available.
   Shell's deliveries to retail gasoline stations served directly
are not affected by the cap because those stations can't
keep much gasoline in storage, Gibson said.
   He did not know how much of Shell's gasoline in Western states
goes as opposed to retailers.
   Once operations are returned to normal in Alaska, gasoline
prices will start dropping, but not by much, he said. Most of the
increases consumers have seen since the New Year are the result of
a decision last fall by the OPEC nations to limit production. And,
he added, the popular summer driving season is approaching, meaning
demand will stay high and keep prices up.

<HEAD>Union Members Picket Continental Seattle-Tokyo Route Kickoff Dinner</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air travelers will be urged to avoid Continental
Airlines, especially its new Seattle-Tokyo route, regardless of the
outcome of the Eastern Airlines strike, labor leaders said
Wednesday.
   Dozens of members of unions representing pilots, flight
attendants, mechanics, baggage handlers and other employees of
Eastern and other airlines paraded in a steady drizzle outside a
dinner kicking off Continental's Orient route.
   Virtually all, including spouses and children, wore buttons with
a slash through the name of Frank Lorenzo, head of Texas Air Corp.,
the parent company of Eastern and Continental.
   Labor's anti-Continental campaign will continue ``unless there's
some changes in Continental Airlines itself,'' said Tom Baker,
president of International Association of Machinists and Aerospace
Workers District Lodge 751, the main union representing Boeing Co.
production workers.
   ``I would think (labor demonstrators) would have a big impact on
(ridership),'' Baker said.
   Continental is scheduled to begin Seattle-Tokyo service May 31
after wresting control of the route from United Airlines in hotly
contested administrative and court proceedings.
   Pete Runnette, vice president of Continental's international
division, said he would be glad to see an end to the Machinists'
strike against Eastern but insisted it would not affect
Seattle-Tokyo ridership.
   Local business leaders and government officials overwhelmingly
favored United, which has the most flights of any airline at
Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, in the route competition, but
``I think that's behind us now,'' Runnette said.
   Nearly 1,000 travel agents, state tourism officials, Port of
Seattle representatives, Chamber of Commerce leaders and other
dignitaries were expected for the lavish dinner at the Museum of
Flight, said Mark Strope, Continental's local station chief.

<HEAD>Davis Says He Would Not Bust Up Northwest Airlines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock of NWA Inc. rose $3.50 to a
record-high $87.25 a share after oil mogul Marvin Davis said his
$2.62 billion proposal to buy the parent of Northwest Airlines
would not require selling the carrier's main assets.
   ``We do not intend to `bust up' the company, and our planned
financing will not necessitate the sale of any of the company's
strategic assets,'' Davis said in a letter he sent to NWA's board
of directors Tuesday and released to the media Wednesday.
   More than 2.5 million shares of NWA stock changed hands
Wednesday.
   The Los Angeles-based billionaire, whose holdings include real
estate and entertainment properties, owns about 3 percent of NWA's
29.1 million shares and offered to pay $90 a share for NWA stock in
a letter last week to company directors.
   ``With the equity we are prepared to commit and the anticipated
structure of the balance of the financing, the company's projected
cash flow is adequate to service the debt involved,'' the second
letter said.
   Davis said in the letter that his group is ``prepared to
increase the price of our offer in the context of a negotiated
transaction.''
   A spokesman for the nation's fourth-largest air carrier, based
in suburban Eagan, confirmed receipt of the letter, but said the
company would not comment.
   Northwest Chairman Steven Rothmeier has said the directors will
review the offer, but he has not said when.
   The airline has said it intends to remain independent. State
officials have rallied behind the carrier, introducing legislation
intended to thwart a hostile takeover.
   In Washington, Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich and Rep. James
Oberstar, D-Minn., met with Northwest representatives Wednesday and
spoke later by telephone with Davis. Afterward, they told reporters
they still opposed the billionaire's offer.
   Perpich and Oberstar, chairman of the House aviation
subcommittee, said they remained concerned that Davis would have to
sell parts of the airline to finance the deal. They said that might
result in layoffs and in Northwest moving its service hub from
Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   Guy Cook, chairman of International Association of Machinists
District Lodge 143, said he remains ``suspicious'' of Davis' offer
because Davis has not provided specifics about how he would finance
it.
   ``I believe he has a history of buying and selling companies,''
said Cook, who heads the union representing two-thirds of
Northwest's 35,000 employees. ``He has ownership for a period of
time and then he sells it off.''
   Kurt Rivard, a financial analyst for Minneapolis-based Dain
Bosworth Inc., said the increase in NWA's stock price Wednesday
suggests confidence on the part of investors that a higher bid is
on its way.
   ``It could come from Davis, it could come from Northwest, it
could come from somewhere else,'' Rivard said.
   Before Davis made his offer, the company disclosed a separate
group of investors was interested in buying NWA. The identity of
that group, which said it owns 4.9 percent of the stock, has not
been disclosed.
   Davis repeated in his letter an earlier statement that he
intends to expand the airline's domestic and international routes
and keep the headquarters in Minnesota. He also said his plans call
for ``no employee layoffs, work-force reductions or alterations in
seniority schedules.''
   The letter said Northwest management would be retained, but also
said, ``we intend to effect only those management changes required
to improve NWA's performance.''
   Analysts have said a takeover could impair Northwest's fleet
modernization plans because Davis would have to sell assets and
cuts operating costs to service takeover debt. But Davis said in
his letter that the acquisition plan ``in no way calls for the
reduction of the company's present capital investment program.''
   Northwest has discussed profit-sharing and stock ownership plans
with its unions for more than a year. Analysts have said an
employee stock ownership plan could help the carrier defend itself
against a takeover by putting more stock in friendly hands.

<HEAD>Alaska's Marriage With Oil Industry: On The Rocks</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When the tanker Exxon Valdez hit the
rocks, so did Alaska's marriage of convenience with the oil
industry.
   But despite the environmental and economic damage wrought by the
nation's worst oil spill, Alaska is unlikely to divorce itself from
an industry whose taxes fund 85 percent of state services.
   Elected officials and political observers say the relationship
instead will be marked by greater mistrust and skepticism, and
future oil development in Alaska may be curtailed.
   ``I guarantee Alaska won't have the same trust in the industry
that it had in the past,'' Senate President Tim Kelly said Tuesday.
``We're going to take the Missouri attitude: Show me.''
   The sentiment expressed by Kelly, a pro-development Anchorage
Republican and longtime industry supporter, has been heard
throughout the state Capitol since the Good Friday spill.
   ``The spill is going to change the political chemistry in
Alaska,'' Gov. Steve Cowper said. ``It's probably too early to
assess what changes will take place. However, it is clear that
people are not likely to trust statements that the industry makes
on their face for a long time to come.''
   Legislators say the industry, which for years assured Alaskans
it could handle a massive oil spill quickly, has lost its
credibility.
   ``The full-faith-and-credit type of attitude toward their
operation is going to change,'' warned Democratic Rep. Ben
Grussendorf.
   After construction of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline in the
mid-1970s, Alaska began cashing in on its abundant petroleum
reservoirs, rushing to bring its villages many of the modern
conveniences taken for granted in the Lower 48.
   Oil brought telephone service to even Alaska's most remote
areas, dozens of schools and community buildings, a state
television network, water and sewer systems, airports and roads.
   Most of all, it brought money. Lots of money.
   Alaska is the only state that annually pays its residents just
for living there. Last year, each Alaskan got a ``dividend'' of
$827 from interest earned by the state Permanent Fund, a $10
billion savings account derived from oil money. For a family of
four, that meant $3,308.
   The flood of oil money also allowed the state to repeal its
income tax in 1980. There's no state sales tax.
   ``Most people in Alaska are aware that the oil industry brings
benefits and detriments,'' Cowper said. ``We've enjoyed the
benefits over the years. Now we're seeing the detriments.''
   Bill Glude, executive director of the Alaska Environmental
Lobby, said he was surprised how widespread the sense of betrayal
has become.
   ``We don't like to make the goose that lays the golden egg
uncomfortable. Suddenly the industry has laid a black egg and we're
not too enchanted with the goose,'' Glude said.
   ``I think a lot of people are ready to declare their
independence from Big Oil. We're seeing a lot of recognition that
the state is entirely too dependent on the oil industry for its
revenue and economic base.''
   Many observers, however, doubt Alaska's dependence on its
natural resources will end as long as there's vast amounts of oil,
minerals and timber to be sold in the nation's largest state.
   ``Resource development is so intimately linked with our history
and our future,'' said Rep. Fran Ulmer, a Democrat. ``We are a
resource-rich state and our resources are what produce jobs, what
produce income and sufficient revenue to support services Alaskans
have come to expect.''
   Ulmer and other legislators predict that as a result of the
spill the state will toughen its environmental laws, provide more
money to monitor compliance with those laws, and demand more proof
of environmental safeguards.
   Lawmakers already have jumped on the new anti-oil bandwagon.
Legislation introduced Tuesday in the Senate would tax oil
companies to pay for protection of state land against spills. And
what appeared to be a losing campaign by Cowper to increase the
state's oil-production tax has new life.
   The fallout from the Valdez spill also may dampen development
overall in what has always been a pro-development state, one that
bills itself as ``The Last Frontier.''
   ``I think the development spirit in Alaska is going to be much
more cautious than before the oil spill,'' Kelly said.
   State officials still largely favor new oil exploration and
development, but the spill provides new ammunition to
environmentalists. An end to oil drilling eventually would dry up
the estimated $4 million of oil revenues that flow into the state
treasury daily.
   Democrat Cowper and the state's all-Republican congressional
delegation have been lobbying Congress to open a portion of the
vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil exploration. In the
wake of the spill, the chances of gaining congressional approval
appear slim.
   ``I don't think it will make it impossible to get an ANWR bill
through the Congress,'' Cowper said. ``I just think it will be
extraordinarily difficult.''

   A new effort by the Internal Revenue Service
to spot errors and tax-avoidance schemes without a formal audit has
turned up considerable evidence of apparent non-compliance with
several provisions in the new tax law.
   In some cases, the IRS says, taxpayers are ignoring the
limitation on deducting miscellaneous itemized expenses, such as
union dues. Others are overlooking new restrictions on deducting
personal and investment interest. Some are circumventing
complicated requirements on the treatment of losses from rentals
and passive investment activities.
   The IRS is concentrating on those four issues because they
underwent significant change in the 1986 tax overhaul, show up on
numerous returns and have the potential for yielding substantial
amounts of money for the government, Rick Hayes of the IRS said in
an interview Wednesday.
   The IRS is looking at 1987 and 1988 tax returns to determine how
much revenue is being lost and how forms and instructions could be
changed to eliminate confusion and opportunity for cheating.
   Rather than waiting for barely 1 percent of returns to make
their way through the formal audit procedure _ which can be as long
as two years after returns are processed _ the IRS has set up teams
in each of the 10 regional service centers to make spot checks as
soon as returns are filed.
   A big goal in the effort is to not only correct the returns that
are checked but also to make the public aware of what mistakes are
being made with regularity and how to avoid them.
   ``When we see things on the return that are not allowable, we
want first to get that information to taxpayers through
public-affairs channels ... during the filing season,'' said Hayes,
who directs IRS research on audit planning.
   ``We want to fix as many of these things as we can without doing
audits on people,'' he said. ``If we can do these as part of
(returns) processing, that's what we want to do.''
   The agency is studying several thousands of returns for 1987,
the first year that most of the major tax changes went into effect.
Those returns were filed in 1988. About 150,000 1988 returns, which
are due by April 17, are being checked.
   As much as anything else, the new program is an attempt by the
IRS to see how people are reacting to the 1986 law, which, by some
calculations, represented the biggest change in the federal income
tax since it was enacted in 1913.
   ``There were so many changes, designed to close loopholes and
reduce deductions,'' explained IRS spokesman Paul Nerdlinger. ``We
need to know how people are taking it. Are the changes
misunderstood? Are people aware they have lost some deductions but
are still intent on taking them?''
   One of the big changes affects millions of itemizers who were
accustomed to fully deducting union dues, business publications and
similar miscellaneous expenses. Under the new law, only the portion
of such expenses (with a few exceptions) that exceeds 2 percent of
adjusted gross income may be deducted.
   The spot check of 1987 returns found many taxpayers ignored the
2 percent floor. Others deducted expenses that did not qualify,
such as personal attorney fees.
   Another major change limited to 65 percent the portion of
personal interest (such as on credit cards and education loans)
that could be deducted for 1987. Similar restrictions were imposed
on investment interest. Spot checks indicated many taxpayers had
circumvented those restrictions by deducting the interest as a
business expense on Schedule C.
   Similarly, Hayes said, some filers have tried to dodge
limitations on deducting passive losses and rental losses by
writing them off as business losses on Schedule C.
   On returns filed this year, the IRS has found many taxpayers
still trying to avoid the limitation on deducting personal
interest. Other areas of non-compliance on current returns, Hayes
said, include claiming too much depreciation for automobiles used
in business, and attempting to avoid the 80 percent limit on
deducting business-related meals and entertainment.

   The Bush administration is allying itself with
the automobile industry and opposing congressional efforts to set
deadlines for the government to issue new motor vehicle safety
requirements.
   Barry Felrice, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration's associate administrator for rulemaking, told the
Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee the agency opposes
legislation that would give it a one-year deadline to issue the new
safety requirements.
   ``The provisions in the new bill requiring us to initiate or
complete these actions within prescriptive time frames are overly
restrictive,'' said Felrice, who said his testimony had been
approved by the Bush administration.
   He said work on safety regulations ``doesn't lend itself to easy
solutions.''
   Officials from the nation's three major automakers _ General
Motors Corp., Chrysler Motors Corp. and the Ford Motor Co. _ also
voiced opposition to a deadline for new rules.
   ``I'd hate to see us get into a mode where time frames dictate
the incorporation of technology,'' Robert Munson, Ford's automotive
safety director, told the panel.
   The agency's opposition to the proposals came as a
disappointment to lawmakers of both parties on the subcommittee and
to consumer activists in the room, who said they had hoped the Bush
administration would adopt a more sympathetic approach to motor
vehicle safety proposals.
   ``I think NHTSA is the comic book example of a federal
regulatory agency that does nothing,'' said an angry Sen. John
Danforth, R-Mo.
   Subcommittee chairman Richard Bryan, D-Nev., complained that the
agency's rule-making process ``has a longer gestation period than
anything known in the laws of nature.''
   Bryan, Danforth and several other senators have introduced a
bill ordering the safety administration to require automakers to
strengthen vehicles to better withstand side impact crashes, in
which nearly one-third of all deaths of auto occupants occur.
   The agency would also have to require head restraints, mounted
rear brake lights and other safety features for pickup trucks and
minivans, a fast-growing market. In addition, the agency would have
to require manufacturers to produce bumpers that can prevent major
damage to a car traveling at 5 mph.
   The Reagan administration had opposed regulations in all those
areas. In 1982, the safety administration rolled back the bumper
standard from 5 mph to 2.5 mph.
   The safety administration already has work under way dealing
with side impact crashes for cars and head restraints for light
trucks, Felrice said.
   He also opposed two new requirements in the bill: that minivans
and pickup trucks be built to better prevent rollovers, and that
car seats used by young children be improved. He said the agency is
already studying both problems.
   ``The bill seems to have us begin rule-making before we complete
the research,'' he said.
   The safety administration, established in 1966 to set vehicle
safety standards and investigate defects, came under frequent
criticism during the Reagan years by lawmakers who accused the
agency of stifling safety initiatives.
   Felrice, who is not a political appointee, testified because the
agency has no administrator. The Bush White House has said it will
nominate Jerry R. Curry, a retired Army general who was defeated in
a bid for Congress from Virginia last fall, for the job.

<HEAD>GM To Equip 500,000 1990-Model Cars With Air Bags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. has told Congress it will
install driver-side air bags as standard equipment on 13 models of
its 1990 passenger cars and offer the devices as options on two
other models.
   Robert A. Rogers, GM's director of automotive safety
engineering, told members of a subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on Commerce, Science and Transportation on Wednesday that GM plans
to equip about 500,000 '90-model cars with air bags.
   The federal government required that automakers equip 10 percent
of their 1987-model cars with some kind of passive restraint,
either automatic seat belts or air bags. That requirement rose to
40 percent with the 1989 model year and will reach 100 percent with
1990-model cars.
   Driver-side air bags will be standard equipment on the 1990
Buick Reatta and Riviera; Cadillac Allante, DeVille, Eldorado,
Fleetwood and Seville; Chevrolet Camaro and Corvette; Geo Storm and
Metro convertible; Oldsmobile Toronado; and Pontiac Firebird, GM
said in a news release.
   The devices will be optional on the Oldsmobile 88 Royale and 98
Regency, the statement said.
   All other 1990-model passenger cars will be equipped with
automatic lap-and-shoulder safety belts, GM said. The automaker
said it planned to phase in a passenger-side air bag during the
early 1990s.
   GM currently offers optional driver-side air bags on its 1989
Oldsmobile 88 Royale and 98 Regency and Cadillac DeVille and
Fleetwood models, the statement said. The devices cost about $850
each.
   Chrysler Corp. has said it will equip all of its 1990-model cars
with driver-side air bags. Air bags currently are standard on some
of its Dodge, Chrysler and Plymouth models.
   Ford Motor Co. said it would offer air bags as standard
equipment on 11 of its 1990 car lines. The devices already are
options on Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz models.

   Attorneys for Michael Milken have asked the U.S.
Supreme Court to consider removing the judge in charge of the
settlement of insider trading charges against the deposed bond
financier and his former employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Meanwhile, unnamed sources quoted by the Wall Street Journal
today said David Solomon, chief investment officer of Solomon Asset
Management, was negotiating with prosecutors to cooperate in the
government's case against Milken. He would be the first Drexel
client to testify against Milken should he become a witness.
   The investigation is believed to focus on allegations of
``parking'' of junk bonds and stocks by Solomon's company,
according to the Journal. When parking occurs securities are bought
with the understanding that they'll be sold back to the original
owner, usually at a prearranged time and price. The process is
intended to hide their true ownership to avoid tax or disclosure
obligations.
   The petition filed Wednesday asks the court to hear their appeal
of a lower court decision allowing U.S. District Judge Milton
Pollack to preside over the Securities and Exchange Commission's
lawsuit against Drexel and Milken.
   Lawyers for Milken and his brother Lowell, who also was named in
the SEC suit filed last September, claim Pollack should be
disqualified because his wife stands to make $30 million from a
leveraged buyout Drexel helped finance.
   They allege the transaction represents a conflict of interest
for Pollack, who must approve any final settlement between Drexel
and the SEC.
   The Milkens were charged last week with a range of criminal
securities law violations in a 98-count racketeering and fraud
indictment that capped a two-year government investigation. A bond
hearing on the charges, in which the government is seeking $1.8
billion in penalties, is set for Friday.
   Michael Milken headed Drexel's California-based high-yield junk
bond division and made a reported $550 million in 1987 before
stepping down after the indictment to prepare his defense.
   The Supreme Court petition came after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in late February refused to rehear a bid to remove
Pollack from the case. But that court did grant a stay against
Pollack issuing any rulings.
   The SEC settlement is a crucial precondition to resolving
criminal securities fraud charges against Drexel. The firm in
December agreed to pay $650 million and plead guilty to six
felonies to settle the criminal charges with the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office.
   Negotiations between Drexel and the SEC hit a roadblock last
month over the federal government's demand to fire Milken before
the pact was reached. That condition, though, may be be moot since
Milken has left the firm.
   A majority of the 12-member appeals court rejected a bid to
allow the full panel to hear the case against Pollack. But in a
dissent, four judges said the the case would continue under ``a
cloud'' if Pollack were allowed to preside.
   Both a district court judge and a three-member appeals court
panel also rejected dismissing Pollack.
   ``We're faced with a situation where we are in a litigation with
a potentially adversarial party, namely Drexel, where that party
was responsible for $30 million going to the wife of the judge,''
said Michael Armstrong, attorney for Lowell Milken.
   ``We think that is a perception that merits the judge stepping
aside,'' he said.
   Michael Milken's lawyers also are challenging the criminal fraud
settlement in federal court, saying it violates his rights by
forcing the firm to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay of more than
$100 million.

<HEAD>Executive Says NCNB May Raise Bid For C&amp;S</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NCNB Corp. said all aspects of its unsolicited
offer for Citizens and Southern Corp. remain open to negotiations,
including the pricetag.
   ``We have the wherewithal to negotiate to the point where C&amp;S is
comfortable ... but only in a face-to-face situation,'' James H.
Hance, chief financial officer of the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank,
said Wednesday.
   Hance said NCNB could raise its offer to $44 a share, $5 more
than the current bid, which was rejected by C&amp;S' board of directors
Monday.
   NCNB offered 1.075 of its shares for each share of Atlanta-based
Citizens and Southern's stock. NBNB's share price closed on the New
York Stock Exchange Wednesday at $34.25, making its C&amp;S bid worth
around $2.3 billion.
   C&amp;S spokesman Dallas Lee said it was up to NCNB to persue the
merger issue. ``I believe the ball is in their court. I think the
C&amp;S board made it clear that C&amp;S is not trying to solicit another
offer.''
   C&amp;S has criticized the NCNB offer, saying the value of that
company's stock may have been inflated by NCNB's purchase of 20
percent of First RepublicBank in Dallas. That bank is now called
NCNB Texas National Bank.

<HEAD>Employers' Group Calls For Importing Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Hong Kong employers on Thursday
urged the government to import foreign workers to ease the British
colony's acute labor shortage.
   The Joint Associations Working Group said importing workers is
essential to avoiding an inflationary spiral and an erosion of Hong
Kong's ability to compete with its Asian neigbors.
   The group estimated Hong Kong needs about 50,000 imported
workers, most of them unskilled, to help fill what it estimated
were 200,000 job vacancies.
   The group's chairman, Martin Barrow, a senior executive at
Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd., said there was a great danger that
Hong Kong could ``lose its competitiveness in the manufacturing
sector, the hotel industry and elsewhere'' because of the shortage
of workers.
   The Hong Kong government announced on Tuesday that it was
considering easing restrictions on the employment of foreign
laborers. Under existing policy, only foreign workers with skills
not available locally are allowed to work in the colony.
   Hong Kong's unemployment rate, currently running at 1.3 percent,
is considered to be a key factor behind the economy's growth
slowing to an expected 6 percent this year, less than half the 1987
rate.
   The labor shortage is due to the combination of a steady brain
drain as the colony approaches its return to Chinese sovereignty in
1997 and tight immigration laws.
   While emphasizing that ``there are no viable alternatives to
importing workers,'' the report said the government should help
encourage automation and productivity through tax breaks and
reducing red tape.
   It said bringing in workers on six-month to two-year contracts,
under a system similar to that practiced in Singapore, would be the
best way to provide relief. The group also suggested the
possibility of Hong Kong industry using workers that commute daily
from China.
   The nine-member group included the Chinese General Chamber of
Commerce, the Federation of Hong Kong Industries, the Hong Kong
Tourist Association and the Textile Council of Hong Kong.

<HEAD>USAir, Teamsters To Begin Contract Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USAir has told the Teamsters it would begin
negotiating with the union on a contract for some 4,000 fleet
service workers in 101 cities, according to a newspaper report.
   But the airline hasn't dropped its opposition to the Teamsters,
which narrowly won an election last December to expand its
representation of fleet services workers from 1,900 in four cities
to the entire USAir system, today's Pittsburgh Post-Gazette said.
   USAir told a U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Va., that it
would appeal last Friday's dismissal of a lawsuit it filed
challenging the National Mediation Board's decision to certify the
union as representing the 4,000 workers.
   The nation's seventh-largest airline said through spokesman
David Clark that it would bargain in good faith as it pursues the
suit, which accuses the board of failing to investigate alleged
election improprieties.
   Bill Genoese, director of the Teamster's airline division,
called the company's decision to bargain for all 4,000 baggage
handlers, air freight handlers and catering employees a victory.
   ``For them to come out and say they would recognize 101 cities,
they were eating crow,'' he told a packed membership meeting
Wednesday at a motel near the Greater Pittsburgh International
Airport.
   Prior to the December election, which the Teamsters won by only
a four-vote margin, the union had represented 1,900 workers at
airports in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston and Buffalo, N.Y.
   The election gave the union the right to extend its
representation to 900 former employees of Pacific Southwest
Airlines who lost their Teamster affiliation when the West Coast
carrier was merged into USAir last year, and to another 1,200
previously unorganized workers at smaller USAir stations.
   The Teamsters, currently working under a contract that has been
open for amendment since July 1987, also are asking a federal court
to order USAir to grant the union access to work sites and employee
records and to set up a grievance procedure for those not
previously represented, Genoese said.
   The union is seeking elimination of a two-tier wage system and
retroactive pay increases of 10 percent annually.
   USAir has offered 3 percent wage hikes and some benefit
improvements, according to the union, but wants to maintain the
lower rate scale for workers hired after May 1985.

   The stock market declined broadly today as
investors cautiously awaited monthly statistics on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.23 to 2,298.57
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 279 up, 604
down and 568 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 21.24 million shares as of 10

   Interest rates moved up a bit in the government securities
market this morning in advance of the Labor Department report due
out Friday on the employment situation for March.
   Private analysts' estimates call for the data to show a slowing
of employment growth, and perhaps an increase in the unemployment
rate to 5.2 percent from February's 15-year low of 5.1 percent.
   That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic
growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off
inflation and interest rates.
   However, investors' concerns lately have focused more on the
possibility of a recession. Brokers also said bond and stock
traders seemed to be leery of any unpleasant surprises in the jobs

   United States airlines received fewer
complaints from passengers in the first quarter of this year than
in the same period of 1988, the Department of Transportation
announced today.
   The department also said, however, that airlines did not do as
well in February this year as they did last year when it came to
arriving on time, mainly because the weather was worse.
   The department's monthly air travel consumer report showed
consumer complaints against leading airlines totaled 970 in March,
down 63 percent from the 2,651 received in March, 1988, and 15
percent from the 1,138 reported in February of this year.
   Complaints for the first quarter of 1989 totaled 3,207, compared
with 8,633 in the first quarter of 1988.
   The 13 largest domestic carriers reported that 72.4 percent of
their flights operated on time in February, compared with 76.7
percent in January and 74.7 percent in February, 1988.
   The department said the increase in delays was due largely to
winter weather conditions. Delays caused by mechanical problems are
not counted in compiling the data.
   Mishandled baggage reports against carriers in February
declined, averaging 7.36 per 1,000 passengers compared to 7.86
percent in January and 8.75 in February 1988.

<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee today approved a bill
that would remove remaining price controls from natural gas on Jan.
1, 1993.
   Approval by the energy and power subcommittee of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee came on a voice vote, sending the
bill to the full committee. A similar bill has been introduced in
the Senate.
   The subcommittee's action ratified a consensus achieved earlier
this year in back-room negotiations among all the major factions
involved in what has sometimes been one of the most bitter fights
in Congress.
   From 33 percent to 40 percent of all natural gas, which supplies
roughly a quarter of the nation's energy needs, is still sold at
controlled prices.
   The controls, established in 1954, have evolved through several
control schemes since then. A partial decontrol in 1985 confounded
many observers when it was followed by a price collapse, driving
some well operators to accept prices below their ceilings.
   The gas still under controls comes from wells that were in
production in 1977. The average March spot price in producing
states, as reported by the newsletter Natural Gas Intelligence, was
$1.44 per thousand cubic feet; contracts for pre-1977 gas range
down to about 30 cents per thousand cubic feet.
   A 1978 bill established several price categories for gas
discovered after that date, some of which became free of controls
in 1985.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission allowed the
lower-priced categories of the rest of the post-1978 gas to rise to
the highest price, which was above the market price.

   Members of the House Banking Committee today
began writing legislation to bail out the troubled savings and loan
industry as S&amp;L regulators underscored the urgency of the situation
by announcing that deposit withdrawals remained at near-record
levels in February.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board announced that depositors
withdrew $9.4 billion from S&amp;Ls in February, down only slightly
from the all-time record of $10.6 billion in withdrawals in January.
   For just the first two months of this year, withdrawals have
totaled $20 billion, more than double the net withdrawals for all
of 1988, which were $8.6 billion.
   Analysts attributed the bulk of the withdrawals in both January
and February to the failure of S&amp;Ls to keep pace with rising
interest rates offered by competitors, principally money market
mutual funds.
   The latest bad news on declining deposits came as the House
Banking subcommittee on financial institutions began voting on the
first of several of the 165 proposed amendments to the S&amp;L
legislation.
   The subcommittee, which includes all but four members of the
full committee, voted 35-12 to adopt an amendment that would leave
the S&amp;L regulatory agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank System, with
even less authority than proposed by President Bush.
   The amendment, offered by Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, gives the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., rather than the bank system,
primary authority to regulate state-chartered S&amp;Ls.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., also
adopted by voice vote an amendment providing fixed four-year terms
to the chairman and vice chairman of the FDIC, which now insures
deposits in commercial banks and would also become responsible for
insuring S&amp;L accounts. The Bush administration had proposed making
the chairman of the FDIC serve at the pleasure of the president.
   A third amendment, offered by Rep. Stephen Neal, D-N.C.,
encourages state housing authorities to buy repossessed S&amp;L
properties from the federal government.
   The subcommittee planned to meet all day today and for two days
next week.
   In a further indication that the legislation may face slow
going, the full committee's chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez,
D-Texas, earlier said he doubted the subcommittee has set aside
enough time and promised to reconsider any of the amendments if
sponsors believe they received short shrift in the subcommittee.
   ``I'm not going to be party to a stampede, to act in great haste
only to repent later at great leisure,'' he said.
   In the Senate, the legislation appears to moving at a faster
pace. The Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich., told members of his panel that Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, intends to have the Senate vote on the bill
during the week of April 17.
   The Senate committee met privately for five and a half hours
Tuesday, eight hours Wednesday and plans another session today.
   ``It looks like many, most, of the controversial decisions will
be made behind the closed doors of the Senate Banking Committee _
no votes, no fingerprints, no political blood,'' said Kenneth A.
Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers
Association of America.
   One possible snag in the Senate is Riegle's effort to scrap the
part of the administration plan that would keep $50 billion in S&amp;L
spending from counting as part of the budget deficit, with many
Democrats lining up behind Riegle and most Republicans opposed.
   Kevin Gottlieb, director of the Senate committee staff, said
panel members Wednesday did not resolve the question, but he said
Democrats were ``sending a strong signal'' that Riegle's funding
package remained ``clearly viable'' despite administration attempts
to squelch it.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has put together a similar
amendment in the House, but on Wednesday he said he was concerned
about reaction in financial markets and had not decided whether to
offer it.
   However, Gonzalez today strongly supported including S&amp;L
spending in the budget, criticizing Bush for going ``the budget
gimmick route _ the most expensive route.''
   ``I know that President Bush is stuck with his `read my lips'
statements, but this committee's responsibility goes beyond
campaign slogans,'' he said.
   In another development Wednesday Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady, in an effort to persuade Congress to accept the main
features of the administration's proposal, warned that he may
recommend a veto of any rescue package that gives the industry too
much leeway in getting its financial house in order.
   Brady told a small group of reporters that Congress would be
``asking for a repeat of the (S&amp;L) problem some time in the
future'' if it passed bailout legislation that postponed the 1991
deadline set by the administration for S&amp;Ls to beef up their
capital.

   Traditional Italian pasta will get a special
government quality-control mark under a measure aimed at helping
consumers distinguish it from cheaper imported mixed-wheat pasta,
news reports said Thursday.
   According to the measure, approved by the Cabinet and expected
to take effect this year, foreign pasta-makers will have to list
their ingredients on packages they want to sell in Italy.
   Even diners in restaurants will have to be notified of the type
of pasta they are eating, according to the new law.
   Traditional Italian pasta, made from durum wheat, stays firm
when cooked, an important quality for those who like it ``al
dente.''
   In July, the European Economic Community Court of Justice
overturned an Italian law that barred the sale of pasta not made
entirely with durum wheat.
   The Italian pasta industry has been concerned that consumers
will be tempted to turn to the less firm mixed-wheat pasta, which
costs up to 30 percent less than durum pasta and is produced in
West Germany and Holland.

   President Bush today renewed his threat to
veto legislation raising the minimum wage beyond $4.25 an hour as
Senate Democrats moved to quickly pass a bill raising the wage
floor to $4.55.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who met with Bush and
relayed his comments to reporters, said the president ``made it
abundantly clear there will be absolutely no flexibility, not one
penny, not one deviation'' from his position on the minimum wage.
   Bush met with Republican congressional leaders hours before the
Senate opened debate on the legislation.
   The Senate bill, sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
would raise the hourly minimum from $3.35 to $4.65 by January 1992
and contains no provision allowing a lower wage for new workers.
   But Kennedy aides said he would offer an amendment making his
measure identical to the House bill passed two weeks ago, which has
a final wage of $4.55 and would allow employers to pay new entrants
in the job market a ``sub-minimum'' for two months.
   Bush has insisted that employers be allowed to pay any new
employees a sub-minimum ``training wage'' for six months. The GOP
leaders who met with Bush said he also reiterated his opposition to
shortening that time frame.
   Another of the Republicans with whom Bush met, Sen. Thad
Cochran, R-Miss., told reporters afterward that ``the message that
was given to the president by the Senate (GOP) leadership was that
we're going to stand with him on the minimum wage issue. And we
urged him not to back down from his commitment to $4.25 and the
six-month training wage.''
   Republicans could thwart the Democrats' quick-passage strategy
by staging a filibuster, but an aide to one leading GOP senator
said there were no plans to do that. The aide said it appeared the
Democrats had the votes to win passage of their plan by early next
week.
   Meanwhile, a new poll said there was overwhelming public support
for an increase in the minimum wage, which has been at $3.35 since
1981.
   The Washington Post@ABC News survey, conducted March 30 through
April 3, said 84 percent of respondents backed an increase while 14
percent did not. Eighty-two percent said they favored an increase
even if it would trigger higher consumer prices.
   But only about half of the 84 percent who initially favored a
higher minimum wage said they would hold to that opinion even if it
meant businesses would stop hiring, or would fire, workers because
of added payroll costs caused by a higher minimum wage. The poll
had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   By agreeing to amend his bill, Kennedy, provided the amended
version wins passage, averts the need for a conference committee to
resolve differences between the House and Senate versions.
   A number of other amendments were also expected, including a GOP
attempt to substitute Bush's proposal.
   A lobbyist in favor of raising the minimum wage said Bush's
repeated veto threats had all but quashed any hopes by Democratic
sponsors of avoiding a showdown with the president.
   ``He says he won't compromise so I don't see a need for us to do
anything except send him our bill,'' said AFL-CIO lobbyist Robert
McGlotten.
   Bush has been adamant in saying he would veto the House-passed
bill and appears to have the votes to sustain a veto in both
chambers of Congress.
   While the House-passed bill cuts the final target of the hourly
minimum wage to $4.55, it moves up the effective dates of the three
increases from Jan. 1 to Oct. 1 _ meaning the first increase would
come this year and the last jump would occur Oct. 1, 1992.
   Bush has proposed three 30-cent increases in the minimum wage
beginning Jan. 1, 1990, and ending two years later with the hourly
minimum at $4.25.
   The president said his support for those increases hinges on a
provision allowing employers to pay new workers a sub-minimum wage
for six months regardless of any past experience with another
employer. The sub-minimum, under the Bush plan, would be $3.35 an
hour after the first increase in the minimum wage. It would rise to
$3.40 an hour by 1992.
   The House-passed bill sets the wage for new hires _ provided it
is their first job _ at $3.35 effective Oct. 1. When the subsequent
increases in the minimum wage took effect the sub-minimum would
rise as well, to 85 percent of the minimum. The provision allowing
the new-hire wage would expire on Sept. 30, 1992.

<HEAD>Maxwell Reports Higher 1988 Pretax Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communication Corp. PLC, the British
conglomerate that acquired Macmillan Inc. last year for $2.6
billion, on Thursday reported its 1988 pretax profits rose 8.7
percent.
   In the year ended Dec. 31, pretax profit rose to 180.4 million
pounds, or $306.7 million, from 166 million pounds, or $282.2
million a year earlier, the company said.
   Profit after taxes and minority interest rose 2.8 percent to
$230.5 million, from $224.06 million the year before, the company
said.
   Earnings fell to 37.5 cents a share from 45.3 cents, a drop of
20.8 percent, because of a 70 percent expansion in share capital
from a rights issue last July.
   Maxwell said its sales rose 27.6 percent to $1.90 billion, from
$1.5 billion a year earlier.
   Chairman Robert Maxwell said last year ``saw the achievement of
our grand strategy of transforming within a few years a practically
bankrupt printing company into one of the big 10 global
communications and information corporations.''
   In addtion to the November takeover of Macmillan, Maxwell
Communication reached agreement in October with U.S. publisher Dun
&amp; Bradstreet to buy the Official Airlines Guide for $750 million.

<HEAD>News Corp. May Sell Travel and Hotel Industry Publications</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp. may sell its business publications
that serve the travel and hotel industry in its effort to reduce
its nearly $7 billion debt but won't sell its consumer magazines,
the company said Thursday.
   Rupert Murdoch, chief executive of the Australian-based media
giant, said through a spokesman that the company has ``had
approaches'' about its nine business publications and that it
intends to ``entertain them.''
   But Murdoch said, ``We will not sell any consumer publications
here or anywhere in the world.''
   Murdoch's comments came in response to a report in the Wall
Street Journal on Thursday that quoted unnamed publishing industry
executives as saying News Corp. is ``actively shopping'' the
business publications and ``might be willing to entertain offers
for some of its consumer magazines, such as New Woman and Star, and
for some of its publications in Europe and the Pacific.''
   But in his statement, Murdoch said he ``won't even entertain any
offers ... about the other publishing properties.''
   News Corp., which publishes newspapers, magazines and books and
owns television stations, a television network and a film company,
has spent heavily on acquisitions in recent years.
   News Corp. said last year in connection with its $3 billion
purchase of the company that publishes TV Guide that it planned to
sell $1 billion in assets by June of this year.
   Asset sales to date have amounted to about $800 million,
including the sales of the 20th Century Fox Film building in Los
Angeles for $320 million and News Corp.'s 50 percent interest in
Elle magazine for $160 million.
   News Corp.'s business publications include Fast Facts, Hotel and
Travel Index, Meetings &amp; Conventions, Official Meeting Facilities
Guide, Official Hotel &amp; Resort Guide, OHRG Cruise Directory, On
Deck, Travel Weekly and World Travel Directory.

<TEXT>
   Angry state officials asked the Coast
Guard to take the helm of the cleanup of the nation's worst oil
spill, and the fired captain of the Exxon Valdez left a New York
jail today after posting a reduced bond.
   Capt. Joseph Hazelwood posted the $25,000 bail, slashed from $1
million by a judge who called the higher amount set by another
judge ``unconstitutionally excessive.''
   On Wednesday, an enraged Judge Kenneth Rohl set the bail and
said of the spill, ``We have a man-made destruction that has not
been equaled, probably, since Hiroshima.''
   Hazelwood spent Wednesday night in jail on New York's Long
Island, where he lives, and an extradition request was pending.
   Also Wednesday, two oil companies _ Shell and Chevron _ limited
gasoline deliveries to distributors in Western states in what one
official called the first U.S. gas rationing since the Arab oil
embargo of 1973. Both companies said the rationing was to prevent
the hoarding of gasoline in the wake of the spill.
   In Washington, officials from Exxon Corp., the Bush
administration and the state of Alaska were called to the Capitol
to brief members of Congress today on the spill.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner testified that
contingency plans were never adequate to handle an oil spill the
size of the current one. He said it was too early to place blame,
but that Exxon Corp. did not have enough equipment on hand.
   Exxon chairman L.G. Rawl, in his prepared statement, again
apologized on behalf of his company for the spill, but said Exxon's
response to the accident was ``immediate and thorough.''
   With the slick now larger than Delaware, Gov. Steve Cowper asked
Coast Guard Rear Adm. Edward Nelson Jr. to take control of the
cleanup.
   Cowper said Nelson indicated he would, but a formal decision was
pending.
   The governor charged that Exxon has been too bureaucratic in
overseeing the cleanup, and other state officials complained of a
lack of planning and inadequate updates.
   ``We think there has to be a much more disciplined management
structure,'' Cowper told reporters. ``Maybe that's been the problem
all along. You need a military system to get things done.''
   In his letter to Nelson, Cowper noted that less than 4 percent
of the 10.1 million gallons of oil spilled in Prince William Sound
on March 24 had been recovered, and that the slick had reached the
Gulf of Alaska.
   But Exxon spokesman Henry Beathard said the company believed it
was the best organization to manage the effort.
   ``We gathered all the resources and organized the cleanup,'' he
said. ``We think the most effective and efficient way to carry out
this project is (for Exxon) to continue.''
   The tanker was freed from Bligh Reef, 25 miles outside Valdez,
with an infusion of compressed, inert gas into its hull, a rising
tide and a nudge from six smoke-belching tugboats, which steered it
on a slow 30-mile journey to a remote cove.
   Two skimmers and boats pulling two containment booms trailed the
tanker, mopping up a sheen of oil.
   The ship had to evade thousands of icebergs, some as big as
houses.
   ``We're not going to move fast,'' said Gary Gorski, Exxon's
salvage coordinator. ``We're trying to work our way around these
little dorky bits out here.''
   A newspaper, meanwhile, reported that a Coast Guard investigator
speculated that Hazelwood unknowingly had set the ship on a
collision course with the reef and then apparently placed it on
automatic pilot without telling the third mate.
   The uncertified third mate was in command when the ship ran
aground, but the investigator said there was no way to confirm if
being on automatic pilot played a part in the accident, the
Anchorage Times said.
   Asked about the report, a Coast Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant
Officer Rick Meidt, said: ``None of the facts in that story are in
dispute to the best of my knowledge.''
   The Coast Guard, however, released a statement saying neither it
nor the National Transportation Safety Board have confirmed the
investigator's ``opinions and speculations.''
   Hazelwood, 42, is charged with operating a ship while drunk,
reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil. The
misdemeanors carry a maximum penalty of 2\ years in prison and a
$10,000 fine upon conviction.
   FBI officials in Washington said they are investigating whether
Hazelwood could be charged with felony violations of the Clean
Water Act, which prohibits negligent discharge of pollutants into
navigable waters.
   Flow through the trans-Alaska pipeline has returned to its
normal daily amount of 2.1 million barrels, according to the
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. Oil flow from the North Slope had been
cut by 60 percent because of tanker restrictions in Valdez harbor.
   Oil has floated over 2,600 square miles, soiled 800 miles of
coastline, killed thousands of animals and resulted in millions of
dollars in losses to fishermen.
   The Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute said it had received
inquiries from customers concerned about the spill's effect on
seafood. Because of the concerns, it has mailed letters to 20,000
fish brokers, wholesalers, restaurants and supermarkets.
   Shell spokesman Bill Gibson in Houston said the gasoline
rationing by his company and Chevron is the first he could recall
since the Arab oil embargo.
   Gibson said Shell's decision to put a cap on its deliveries to
wholesalers in Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Utah, Nevada
and Arizona resulted from excessive buying by those distributors in
the last week.

   It was the car cool Baby Boomers grooved on.
   The Mustang, Ford Motor Co.'s breakthrough into lightweight,
affordable sports cars, turns 25 this month with an immortalized
place in auto history, making its mark the same way the Beatles
reshaped rock'n'roll.
   Teen-agers dreamed of cruising drive-ins in their new Mustangs
which, like the dreamers themselves, grow older by the year. Some
original Mustang drivers say they don't feel a day older than when
they slid behind the wheel for the first time.
   ``It felt great,'' Stanley Tucker of Montreal remembered about
the day 25 years ago when he drove the first Mustang ever made at
Ford's Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant, where 52 of the cars an
hour still roll off the line.
   Ruby Hummel of East Detroit got into the Mustang love affair
late. But she got her driver's license late, too. She bought a used
'68 Mustang when she got her license in 1973 at age 46.
   ``It makes you feel young,'' she said at a suburban Detroit
Jeep-Eagle dealership where she and her husband were shopping for a
new car. They pulled up in a '66 light blue and white Mustang _ a
car she says she won't trade.
   The nation is dotted with Mustang clubs and Mustang collectors.
About 75 percent of the members in the Performance Ford Club of
America are Mustang owners, said club chairman Charles Crites of
Ashville, Ohio.
   Mustang lovers praise what they call the simplicity of the early
model, promoting an exuberance and free spirit that captivated
young consumers and made Ford's rivals rethink and redesign their
own sporty models.
   The original Mustang, unveiled when Lee Iacocca was president of
Ford, had a base a price of $2,368 and featured a 170-cubic-inch,
six-cylinder engine.
   ``It could be fixed by a general novice person in the back
yard,'' in the early years, Crites said. ``Simplicity has gone out
with cheap gas.''
   Crites said he's owned about 15 Mustangs over the years, and has
three in his collection of 25 cars. His favorite Mustang is the
1969 Mustang Shelby GT 500.
   Like other Mustang buyers, Crites is proud of how he found his
pride and joy. ``In 1970, I went in (to a dealership) to buy a
truck,'' he said. ``I saw the Mustang sitting there for $3,700. I
went back two weeks later and they dropped the price by about
$500.''
   Crites drove it away that day.
   He was one of hundreds of thousands who bought Mustangs during
the early years. Ford formally introduced the car on April 17,
1964, about five weeks after Mustang's Job 1 rolled out of Ford's
Dearborn plant.
   Some purists call the first editions 1964{ models. Ford calls
them '65s.
   The first-year sales projection of 100,000 cars was passed in
four months. Sales increased to its best year in 1966, when 549,400
Mustangs were driven off Ford dealership lots.
   The second generation of Mustangs, called the Mustang II, was
introduced for the 1974 model year. It was a smaller than the '73,
reflecting the need for better fuel efficiency during the oil
crunch of the mid-1970s.
   Mustang sales bottomed out in 1983 at about 117,000 cars,
raising predictions that the car, like an aging television sit-com,
had finally run out of gas. But last year, Ford sold 170,100
Mustangs.
   The 1989 Mustang, which has a four-cylinder engine, has a base
price $9,450. An optional beefed-up 5.0-liter engine capable of 223
horsepower compared with 90 horsepower in the basic engine, is a
popular seller.
   Ford has said it plans to commemorate the Mustang birthday this
April 17 with a low-key event at its Dearborn headquarters but
doesn't plan a special edition of the car and is leaving the hoopla
to others.
   A caravan of 37 Mustangs owned by Europeans is tooling around
the country on what's been billed as the ``American Pony Drive.''
The caravan started March 24 in Jacksonville, Fla., and winds up
May 9 in Baltimore.
   But whether in the United States or overseas, Mustang's design
has been what's attracted buyers.
   ``I just like the way it looks,'' Mrs. Hummel said. ``It's
sporty looking.''

   Here are significant dates in the development and
marketing of Ford Motor Co.'s Mustang, celebrating its silver
anniversary this month:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Late 1960 _ Early work began in the development of a lightweight
sports car.
   Early 1962 _ Work got under way in earnest on the vehicle
designed to weigh less than 2,500 pounds and cost less than $2,500.
It went through a number of code names, including Allegro, Cougar
(no relation to the Mercury car) and T-5.
   March 9, 1964 _ Job One rolled off the line at Ford's Dearborn
assembly plant. It weighed 2,572 pounds with base sticker price of
$2,368.
   April 17, 1964 _ Formal introduction of the Mustang.
   April-August 1964 _ First-year sales projections of 100,000
Mustangs were surpassed in four months. More than 417,000 Mustangs
were sold during the first year of availability.
   Mid-1965 _ Ford added the GT-350 and GT-500 to the Mustang
stable, giving the car more power for the 1966 model year.
   1969 model year _ Mustang grew bulkier as ``muscle cars'' came
into vogue. During the next two model years, Ford introduced the
Mustang Mach I, Boss 302, Boss 429 and Boss 351.
   Mid-1970s _ The Arab oil embargo hit, and gasoline prices
soared, spelling trouble for high-powered, gas-gobbling cars.
   Mid-1973 _ Ford brought out the second generation of the car, a
smaller Mustang II, for the 1974 model year. During the next two
model years, the shell of the car remained virtually the same, but
Ford beefed up engines, offering a V-8 in 1975 and a Cobra II in
1976.
   Fall 1978 _ The third generation of the Mustang was introduced,
built on the same platform as Mercury Cougars and Ford Thunderbirds
of the day. The platform is used in the 1989 Mustang.
   Mid-1981 _ The Mustang GT was reintroduced.
   Fall 1985 _ Ford added a 5-liter high output engine, an option
the car still carries.
   April 1989 _ Ford quietly celebrates Mustang's Silver
Anniversary. A caravan of 37 Mustangs owned by Europeans begins
U.S. tour on the ``American Pony Drive.''

<HEAD>Sale Of First Mustang A Mistake</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Mustang Anniversary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of the first Mustang off the assembly
line was a mistake.
   It had nothing to do with the car. It was the salesman doing his
job too well, according to Stanley Tucker, a corporate airline
pilot now based in Montreal.
   ``They should have known better, I guess,'' Tucker said in a
telephone interview.
   Tucker was 32 when he was in St. Johns, Newfoundland, driving by
Parsons Ford on April 14, 1964. There, on a pedestal, was a white
Mustang convertible, with a black interior.
   ``I went in and said I want to buy it,'' Tucker recalled, not
knowing that the car was in the eastern Canadian province as part
of a promotional tour a few days before the Mustang officially was
introduced.
   ``I guess the salesman didn't realize he shouldn't sell it,''
Tucker said. ``I wrote him out a check and drove the car off.''
   A few days later, the dealer called Tucker asking him to return
the car.
   ``I said `No way.' Ford called and they couldn't get the car
back either,'' he said.
   ``I was driving that thing around for about six months (in St.
Johns) before I ever saw another,'' Tucker said. ``It felt great.
The car was stopping traffic on the streets. People would come over
and say, `What in heaven's name is that?'''
   In the United States, Mustangs were no strangers on the road.
The car got off to one of the hottest starts in automotive history,
topping its annual projection of 100,000 sales in the first four
months.
   The appearance of the car was the thing that caught the eye of
Tucker and hundreds of thousands of other buyers in the early days.
Tucker kept the original Mustang for two years.
   ``After a couple of years, they (Ford) came up with a gimmick
and said, `How about trading the first car in for the millionth?' I
was stupid enough to do it.''
   The original Mustang, serial number 55F08F100001, is on display
now at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich.
   Tucker, unrelated to automobile designer Preston Tucker of the
1940s, said he had no problem with the original Mustang during the
two years he owned the car. During that time, he put 10,000 miles
on it, about half of the usual mileage. Open road is scarce on
Newfoundland.
   ``What I'm sorry of in hindsight is getting rid of the first
one,'' he said. ``If I had any brains, I would have put it up on
blocks and let it appreciate.''

   Stock prices retreated today as investors
cautiously awaited monthly statistics on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.46 to
2,292.34 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 476 up, 824 down and
587 unchanged.
   Interest rates moved up a bit in the government securities
market today in advance of the Labor Department report due out
Friday on the employment situation for March.
   Private analysts' estimates call for the data to show a slowing
of employment growth, and perhaps an increase in the unemployment
rate to 5.2 percent from February's 15-year low of 5.1 percent.
   That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic
growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off
inflation and interest rates.
   However, investors' concerns lately have focused more on the
possibility of a recession. Brokers also said bond and stock
traders seemed to be leery of any unpleasant surprises in the jobs
report.
   Losers among the blue chips included General Motors, down [ at

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner told
Congress today that government and industry never had a contingency
plan sufficient to handle an oil spill the size of the one caused
by the Exxon Valdez tanker accident in Alaska.
   He did not place the blame on anyone specifically, saying, ``it
is too early to have factually adequate evidence of culpability.''
   ``But my impression is that a somewhat over-optimistic attitude
crept in about our readiness and ability to deal with a spill of
this magnitude, or even that an accident of this size could
occur,'' Skinner said.
   He told the Senate Commerce Committee that the Exxon Corp. did
not have enough equipment on hand when the spill occurred March 24
in Prince William Sound, disgorging 10 million gallons of crude oil.
   ``This was compounded by the remote location of the spill, but
it goes without saying that every step of the planning for moving
Alaskan oil by water had to assume a spill in just this locale,''
said Skinner.
   On the other side of the Capitol, House Republicans called on
President Bush to become directly involved in the clean-up efforts.
   Rep. Jim Saxton of New Jersey told a news conference called by
the House Republican Research Committee that the president should
immediately put one of the federal agencies in charge of
coordinating clean-up.
   The Republican group also called for legislation that would
outline strict contingency plans for future oil spills and place
the financial responsibility with the corporation responsible for
the accident.
   Skinner, too, called for updating all contingency plans for oil
transportation.
   ``It is also time to reassess the need for comprehensive oil
spill liability and compensation legislation,'' he said, noting
that bills have been introduced but never passed by Congress.
   Skinner also warned of problems that would occur if a foreign
tanker, whose owner had fewer resources than Exxon, had a similar
accident.
   ``There would be no means under current law to assure that
damage costs are met,'' he said.
   ``Moreover, a significant proportion of the crude oil arriving
in the United States is not effectively covered by the four
existing U.S. statutes,'' Skinner said, naming sections of the
Clean Water Act and the outer continental shelf, deepwater ports
and trans-Alaska pipeline acts.
   Exxon chairman L.G. Rawl also appeared before the committee.
   In his prepared statement, Rawl again apologized for his company
for the spill, but said Exxon's response to the accident was
``immediate and thorough.''
   ``Exxon takes full responsiblity, and has done so from the
beginning,'' Rawl said.
   Rawl said that as of noon Tuesday, 97 percent of 1 million
barrels of crude oil remaining aboard the Exxon Valdez had been
removed.
   The House Merchant Marine and Fisheries subcommittee on Coast
Guard and navigation held a hearing simultaneously with the Senate
committee.
   At that session, Adm. Paul Yost, commandant of the Coast Guard,
said the service has a ban against anybody on duty having a blood
alcohol level above .04, but has difficulty determining whether a
person is an alcohol abuser.
   Yost said that if applicants for pilot licenses do not mention a
problem on their applications, the Coast Guard does not look
further.
   Joseph Hazelwood, who was captain of the Exxon Valdez, was fired
after blood tests showed that his blood alcohol exceeded the
accepted level 10 hours after the accident.
   Hazelwood admitted drinking before the accident and was not on
the bridge when the tanker went aground. He surrendered Wednesday
on charges which included operating a motorcraft while intoxicated.
   Yost disputed Rawl's contention that Exxon responded
immediately. He told the House subcommittee the company was slow in
its response.
   Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, a top government investigator told a
Senate subcommittee that alcohol tests on Coast Guard personnel on
duty at the time of the accident at a nearby radar station were
``inconclusive'' because they were performed 15 hours after the
grounding.
   James L. Kolstad, acting chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board, told the Senate Appropriations transportation
subcommittee that urine tests on one guardsman produced a reading
of .2 percent, which indicates the presence of a large amount of
alcohol.
   But the guardsman said that when his shift ended, he had had
several drinks at home before being recalled to duty for testing,
Kolstad said.
   On Wednesday, Sen. Alan Cranston and Rep. Mel Levine accused the
Reagan administration of covering up warnings about the potential
disaster from an oil spill on the West Coast.
   The complaints by the two California Democrats was over
materials prepared by the Interior Department's Minerals Management
Service on oil lease sale 91 off the northern California coast.
They said the same environmental findings are the same as those
that would apply in Alaska.
   According to memoranda released by Levine, the Fish and Wildlife
Service told the minerals management service of the high risk of
drilling operations in rough seas, and also cited inadequate
technology and equipment for spill cleanup.
   Levine said minerals management officials deleted the warnings
from their environmental impact statement.
   The lawmakers called on President Bush to cancel the lease sales.
   Action has been delayed until a task force appointed by Bush
completes a study that is to take a deeper look at the
environmental consequences of drilling.

   Most futures prices for soybeans and corn were
higher while most wheat prices were lower at the close Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``It was a choppy market, very quiet,'' said Jerry Zusel, CBOT
floor operations manager for Balfour Maclaine Corp. ``It's not an
exciting time down here.''
   Corn prices were supported by the announcement that the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn,
said research director Jerry Gidel of LIT America Inc.
   Reduced domestic demand and increasing supplies from South
America weighed on May soybeans, which were off a penny at the
close, Zusel said.
   Wheat was lower on the lack of fresh export news, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat was unchanged to 6} cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.97{ a bushel; corn was { cent to
1 cent higher, with May at $2.64} a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 3
cents higher, with May at $1.86 a bushel; and soybeans were 1 cent
lower to 4 cents higher, with May at $7.14 a bushel.

   A group led by former baseball commissioner
Peter V. Ueberroth has agreed to buy Eastern Airlines in a $464
million deal that would give the strike-crippled carrier's
employees a major share of the company, the parties announced today.
   The deal, subject to approval by Eastern creditors and the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, followed lengthy negotiations with Eastern's
parent Texas Air Corp. and was greeted with cheers by union members
locked in a bitter struggle with Eastern management.
   The purchase also was conditioned on Eastern reaching new work
agreements with its striking unions by April 10.
   Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo told a New York news conference
the purchase includes about $200 million in cash and the rest in
securities.
   ``Under this agreement Eastern can be back flying in very short
order,'' Lorenzo said.
   Miami-based Eastern has been virtually paralyzed since March 4
by a Machinists union strike that has drawn the support of pilots
and flight attendants. Eastern filed for reorganization and
protection from creditors in U.S. bankruptcy court in New York on
March 9 as its cash dried up.
   ``To sum it up, it's a mammoth challenge. I'm convinced that
there is a spirit amongst the people in the company that I can help
bring together to help this airline,'' Ueberroth said.
   Lorenzo said that if the unions agreed to the deal the nation's
seventh-largest airline could resume flying 24 hours later. He also
said the airline intended to file a bankruptcy reorganization plan
that would pay creditors 100 percent.
   Lorenzo will remain in charge of Eastern until the deal is
approved, but Ueberroth will participate in formulating the
reorganization plan.
   Texas Air would get $200 million cash, Eastern notes worth about
$185 million, plus Eastern assets valued at about $79 million,
including Eastern's New York-Montreal route plus eight landing
slots and one gate at New York's LaGuardia Airport.
   About 500 striking Machinists jammed their local union hall in
Miami, chanting and cheering ``Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Lorenzo's got to
go'' and ``Take me out to the ballgame'' as they heard news of the
sale.
   But Frank Ortis, vice president of Machinists local 702 and
Miami strike coordinator, said it was impossible to tell whether
unions would fare better under the new proposed ownership ``until
we get into dealings with Commissioner Ueberroth.''
   ``However, we're willing to give it a shot,'' he said.
   The Air Line Pilots Association issued a statement in New York
saying the union was encouraged by the announced deal but stressed
that strike issues still had yet to be resolved and that the union
had not yet been able to review terms of the purchase. The union
also noted that other buyout proposals still could be put before
the bankruptcy court.
   ``Nonetheless, what we have heard so far leaves us cautiously
optimistic,'' stated John Bavis, chairman of the 3,600-member union.
   Ueberroth, who flew to New York late Tuesday night from his
California home, began personal negotiations with Lorenzo early
Wednesday morning and continued them until about 8 p.m., resuming
talks early today.
   Ueberroth's group made a $464 million offer for Eastern last
week and then withdrew the bid after being told by Texas Air that
it had been topped by another suitor, identified by sources close
to the situation as billionaire hotel executive Jay A. Pritzker.
   Under the deal accepted by Texas Air, Ueberroth and Thomas
Talbot, a former airline executive from California, would own 30
percent of the airline. Easterns unions would have get another 30
percent of the company in exchange for wage and work-rule
concessions.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Ardshiel Inc., a smaller New
York firm, will place securities for the remaining 40 percent of
the company.
   In addition to the airline, the Ueberroth group is buying a 19.9
percent interest in Texas Air's computer reservations system. The
reservation network, System One, is comprised of the former systems
of Eastern and Continental Airlines, also owned by Texas Air.

   Many union leaders and rank-and-file members have said they
would accept wage and benefit concessions to help resurrect Eastern
if they were given independence from Texas Air, which acquired the
60-year-old carrier in early 1986 for about $600 million.
   Lorenzo has been vilified by Eastern workers as a union-buster
who was stripping the airline of its assets and funneling them to
Continental, which is substantially non-union.
   In related developments Wednesday, the U.S. bankruptcy court in
New York appointed Washington attorney David Shapiro as examiner in
Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization case.
   Shapiro, 60, a senior partner in the firm Dickstein, Shapiro &amp;
Morin, was recommended by U.S. Trustee Harry Jones and appointed by
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland.
   Lifland recently ordered the appointment of an examiner, whose
unusually broad powers would include a mandate to mediate the
bitter labor dispute at Eastern and get the airline flying again.
   In a separate court action, Lifland approved an agreement
between attorneys for Eastern and the Machinists union governing
areas where peaceful picketing would be allowed at New York's
LaGuardia Airport and at Logan International Airport in Boston.
Eastern previously asked the judge to restrain union picketing on
Eastern property.

market in advance of the Labor Department report due out Friday on
the employment situation for March.
   Private analysts' estimates call for the data to show a slowing
of employment growth, and perhaps an increase in the unemployment
rate to 5.2 percent from February's 15-year low of 5.1 percent.
   That would tend to corroborate recent evidence that economic
growth has been slowing of late, taking upward pressure off
inflation and interest rates.
   However, investors' concerns lately have focused more on the
possibility of a recession. Brokers also said bond and stock

<HEAD>Joint-Venture Steel Plant Dedicated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A sprawling steel plant that has been
modernized at a cost of $400 million for use in a joint venture by
a U.S. company and its South Korean partner was dedicated Thursday
while protesters outside burned Korean flags.
   The 80-year-old factory was renovated as part of a pact between
USX Corp. and giant Pohang Iron &amp; Steel Co. of South Korea, and now
has an annual capacity of 1.4 million tons of finished steel
products, mainly material for tin cans, steel-framed furniture and
appliances.
   The USS-POSCO Industries Inc. plant is part of a 500-acre
complex in this community about 50 miles east of San Francisco.
   Former President Gerald Ford, who spoke at the dedication and
flipped the switch to put the gleaming machines and computers to
work, said joint ventures are an inevitable trend in business and
politics.
   Ford commended officials of both companies for ``the vision and
dedication to see the rebirth of the steel industry in
California.'' He recalled that experts had predicted the end of the
U.S. steel industry, but ``fortunately, the pessimists were wrong.''
   The plant, which began operation in 1909 and hasn't been in full
production for almost 20 years, was the scene of a protest by about
500 people, including members of the International Longshoremen's
and Warehousemen's Union.
   They were objecting to the use of non-union labor to handle the
renovation. ``We want people to know how it affects not just the
nation, but the local community,'' said Frank Belleci, an ILWU
member.
   Plant president E. A. Roskovensky, who said the plant does
employ union labor, said the protest stemmed from an ongoing
disagreement over the hiring of non-union contractors after a union
bid came in far over the cost of non-union labor.
   Under terms of a 1986 agreement, USX and Pohang each owns half
the plant and invested $90 million in its rejuvenation. The pact is
similar to the agreement between General Motors Corp. and Toyota
which created New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. in Fremont, Calif.
   The balance of the money invested _ $220 million _ came from
bank financing. Pohang's investment is the largest ever by a South
Korean company in the U.S.
   The plant will be a boon to the local economy, employing some
1,200 people and paying them a total of about $46 million annually.
The venture already has paid some $12 million in state sales taxes.
   Flanking the podium as Ford spoke was a poster showing three
workers and the slogan, ``We're a whole new breed of steel-maker.''
   Asked whether the plant posed a threat to the U.S. steel
industry, USX board chairman David M. Roderick said it wasn't going
to cause ``one iota'' of trouble.
   ``This is a solution ... to keep an American steel presence on
the West Coast,'' he said.
   Gen. Tae-Joon Park, chairman of Pohang, lauded those who put the
deal together despite ``all sorts of odds and difficulties.''

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose in Latest Week to New Record of $301.2 Billion</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund Report
are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the week ended Wednesday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 465 money market mutual
funds rose by $1.16 billion in the latest week to a new all-time
high of $301.2 billion, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The increase from the previous record of $300.04 billion set
last week marked the 13th straight weekly all-time high for the
funds' assets and reflected the growing attraction of such
investments because of rising interest rates.
   The previous record originally was reported as $299.62 billion
but the Washington-based mutual fund trade group revised it upward.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the week ended
Wednesday, assets of 231 general purpose funds rose $573.3 million
to $98.62 billion, assets of 94 broker-dealer funds increased
$462.4 million to $129.39 billion, and assets of 140 institutional
funds rose $128.2 million to $73.18 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.08 percent from 9.04 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 8.97 from 8.89 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds
remained unchanged at 31 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and savings banks in
the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield
available on money market accounts rose to 6.61 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.56 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, were unchanged at 5.14 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.27
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 9.17 the
previous week. Yields were 9.45 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 9.38
percent; 9.31 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 9.29 percent; and
9.21 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 9.20 percent.

<HEAD>Parent of Bloomie's, Burdine's and Other Chains Undergoes Massive
Change</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>

   You can still get a $100 Christian Dior lace
nightgown at Bloomingdale's swank Manhattan store and buy a good
off-the-rack suit from Burdine's in Miami, but their retailing
parent has undergone a wrenching change in the year since a
Canadian developer took it over.
   Federated Department Stores Inc., which owns Bloomie's,
Burdine's and three other big department store chains, is smaller,
leaner and more focused under its new boss, Robert Campeau. It has
fewer stores, fewer employees and a big mountain of debt.
   It has survived predictions that it would become a financial
ruin and retailing disaster.
   But is it a better company today?
   ``That remains to be seen,'' says Pamela Stubing, an analyst
with Moody's Investor Service Inc. Only now, she said, is Federated
emerging from a tumultuous 12-month transition.
   Campeau won Federated after a bitter, two-month fight that
included a bidding war with rival retailer R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. The
takeover cost Campeau $6.7 billion.
   He quickly sold four Federated department store chains and its
discount and specialty stores to help finance the deal.
   Campeau was accused of decimating a fine old retailer, a charge
he'd heard before. In December 1986, he bought Allied Stores Corp.
for $3.4 billion, and since then has sold 18 of its 24 store
divisions.
   Campeau Corp., the umbrella for his retailing and real estate
operations, now owns nine department store companies: Jordan Marsh,
The Bon, Maas Brothers and Stern's from Allied; and Bloomingdale's,
Burdine's, Lazarus, Abraham &amp; Straus and Rich's-Goldsmith's from
Federated. It also owns Ralphs, a Southern California supermarket
chain spun off from Federated.
   Besides selling hundreds of stores, Robert Campeau has cut 9,000
jobs at Federated and Allied, and again been sharply criticized for
heavy-handedness.
   Campeau Corp. President James Roddy said in an interview that
only administrators were laid off and the cuts had ``no effect
whatsoever on the customers.''
   Campeau has done what retailing strategists said Allied and
Federated should have done long before he came along.
   When the developer first announced his offer for Federated,
securities analysts accused then-Chairman Howard Goldfeder of
literally giving the store away by failing to streamline the
company and make it more competitive.
   Campeau has cut annual operating costs at Allied and Federated
by more than $350 million a year, said 13D Research Services, a
Yorktown Heights, N.Y. firm that analyzes stocks and corporation
finances.
   Campeau Corp. stock, now trading in the teens, could go as high
as $66 a share this year, 13D predicted in a report about his
business.
   While analysts agree that Federated and Allied needed
streamlining, they are concerned about its effect on the retailers.
   It's not yet known ``if they have done a good job in cutting
down costs without destroying the stores,'' said Ms. Stubing of
Moody's.
   But just the fact that the layoffs are behind Campeau's
employees has put the company on a better track, said Walter Loeb,
an analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
   ``Everyone's happier,'' Loeb said. ``The employees are a more
cohesive group.''
   Some anxieties that prevailed a year ago apparently have not
panned out. Many observers said the Federated stores would become
too centralized under Campeau, and lose their individuality and
innovativeness.
   Loeb was reassured a year later, saying, ``Each individual
department store company is standing on its own two feet,'' but
with some direction from the home office.
   Campeau also was accused of buying the companies solely for
their lucrative real estate and the entry that stores like
Bloomingdale's would provide into new shopping malls.
   Real estate, they said, would take priority over good
merchandising.
   Roddy doesn't deny that the companies' properties was the
principal draw for Campeau, as it has been for other
developers-turned-retailers, such as Edward DeBartolo Jr. and
Australia's Hooker Corp.
   ``You acquire shopping centers a lot easier if you acquire the
company,'' Roddy said.
   However, he said, Campeau Corp. is now dependent on retailing
for profit, and the real estate end cannot survive without good
performances from Federated and Allied.
   ``The fact that there is growth in retail sales adds value to
the underlying real estate values within retail,'' Roddy said.
   With that in mind, Campeau has reworked Federated's expansion
plans to concentrate on its star Bloomingdale's division.
   The company aims at opening three new Bloomingdale's a year,
said James Zimmerman, president of Federated and Allied. Campeau
also is adding stores to other divisions and plans to expand or
remodel more than half its 250 stores over the next five years.
   Zimmerman admitted that ``We didn't spend much of spring '88
running the business,'' because executives were busy cutting costs.
   The company has made conservative projections for 1989 partly
because of the sluggish consumer buying of the past two years.
Zimmerman said Campeau hoped for a sales increase of 4 percent,
consistent with industry projects at the start of 1989.
   Campeau's fourth-quarter earnings haven't been announced, but
some analysts expect an improvement from the third quarter, when
Allied and Federated lost a combined $53.5 million. The high cost
of paying the interest on takeover-related debt was partly to blame.
   Unlike most other big retailers, Federated and Allied do not
release their sales figures monthly, making it difficult to assess
their performance.
   One industry analyst, who asked not to be identified, estimated
that despite marginal sales growth for the year ended Jan. 31,
pretax earnings rose 5 percent at Federated and 16 percent at
Allied, thanks largely to cost cuts. Loeb, the Morgan Stanley
analyst, said he expected Campeau to adequately manage the heavy
debt load it took on in acquiring Federated and Allied.
   Concerns about that debt wreaked havoc with its financing plans
last fall.
   Campeau announced in September that Federated and Allied lost a
combined $207 million during the second quarter, when sales slowed.
The next month, Federated's planned $1.15 billion high-yield bond
sale had to be postponed and restructured.
   Published reports said buyers hesitated because of the
retailer's lackluster sales and losses, but Campeau said at the
time the problem was uneasiness in the high-yield bond market
caused by the bidding war in the biggest debt-financed takeover of
all, RJR Nabisco Inc.
   Roddy acknowledged that investors were concerned about Campeau's
debt, but he expressed confidence the company can easily handle its
interest payments.
   The transition at Federated has been rocky, but the company says
it is largely complete, and analysts will be watching see if the
takeover really was a good deal for Robert Campeau.
   Said Ms. Stubing: ``This year is going to be the really telling
year.''

<HEAD>NCNB Wants Chance To Present New Takeover Offer To C&amp;S</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Banking Bids, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NCNB Corp. says it wants to discuss revising its
takeover bid for Citizens and Southern Corp., but C&amp;S officials
said Thursday the North Carolina banking company has done most of
its talking through the news media.
   ``There has been no communication with the C&amp;S board,'' C&amp;S
spokesman Dallas Lee said. ``They (NCNB) are just doing it through
the news media, and it makes it hard for C&amp;S to respond.''
   The C&amp;S board on Monday rejected an offer, made last week by
NCNB, of 1.075 shares of NCNB stock for each share of C&amp;S common
stock. The value of that offer was placed at $39 a share, or about
$2.4 billion.
   James Hance, Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB's chief financial
officer, said Wednesday his company is willing to raise the price
of the offer. He told The Atlanta Journal and The Atlanta
Constitution that analysts' predictions that the new offer would be
$44 worth of stock per share were ``in the ballpark.''
   Hance said, however, that an offer would be negotiated only in a
face-to-face situation with C&amp;S.
   Lee said NCNB has not made an effort to set up such a meeting.
   But Lynn Easley, a spokeswoman for NCNB in Charlotte, said
Thursday, ``We have said at every opportunity we are willing at any
time to sit down with C&amp;S. From the very beginning, we have said we
want to sit down.''
   Ms. Easley said she did not know specifically what efforts have
been made to set up a meeting with the C&amp;S board.
   Lee's comments Thursday were not the first to be critical of
NCNB's communication with Atlanta-based C&amp;S. C&amp;S officials last
week said they learned of the original offer through a news release
before letters to the board outlining the proposal were delivered.
   The C&amp;S board, in turning down NCNB's initial offer, said it was
inadequate and possibly would not pass regulatory muster. C&amp;S has
said the value of the NCNB stock may have been inflated by the
North Carolina bank's purchase of 20 percent of First RepublicBank
in Dallas. That bank is now called NCNB Texas National Bank.
   ``I think the C&amp;S board made it clear that C&amp;S is not trying to
solicit another offer,'' Lee said.

<HEAD>Experts Say NCNB Bid Could Mean Another Protracted Takeover Battle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Six months after Bank of New York Co. won a rare hostile bid to
acquire rival Irving Trust Corp., the banking industry may see
another big takeover war.
   But although the unsolicited $2.4 billion buyout proposal by
giant NCNB Corp. for Atlanta-based Citizens and Southern Corp. is
in some ways similar to the 13-month battle between Irving and Bank
of New York, the latest deal has some key differences.
   It's bigger, could be more likely to generate opposition from
state and federal regulators and involves two institutions
considered strong financial performers.
   ``I guess I'd have to say it pretty much stops and ends with the
fact that both were unsolicited offers,'' said Rodgin Cohen, a
merger specialist with the law firm Sullivan &amp; Cromwell who is
working for Atlanta-based Citizens.
   Bank of New York's $1.4 billion hostile takeover battle for
Irving wasn't the first hostile bank deal, but it was the largest
of its kind to succeed in a banking industry that traditionally had
relied mainly on friendly deals.
   ``I think the Irving-Bank of New York deal definitely broke the
ice,'' Michael Rosen, a Boston attorney specializing in bank
mergers, said Thursday. ``A lot of people felt that deal was an
aberration. But now it's happening again, which is noteworthy.''
   Citizens' board of directors on Monday rejected the stock-swap
merger proposal by Charlotte, N.C.-based NCNB as inadequate.
   Experts see some similarities between the Bank of New York deal
and the NCNB proposal, but there also are plenty of differences.
   The combination of the two would result in a bank with assets of
around $75 billion, placing it firmly in the top 10 among the
nation's bank holding companies. Bank of New York grew to about $50
billion in assets after the Irving acquisition.
   Also, ``Irving was a mediocre performer that didn't live up to
its potential, whereas Citizens has been a strong performer that is
living up to its potential,'' said James J. McDermott Jr., an
analyst with Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods.
   NCNB is offering 1.075 of its shares for each of Citizens'
stock, or around $44 a share. The company has hinted it might be
willing to raise its bid by around $5 a share if Citizens agrees to
negotiations. But Citizens' management and many analysts maintain
that even that's too low.
   NBNC stock closed unchanged at $34.25 a share Thursday. Citizens
fdeclined 25 cents to $35 a share.
   Citizens' main criticism of the offer is that the value of
NCNB's stock may have been inflated after NCNB took over the
management of the banks of the First RepublicBank Corp of Dallas
last year with the government's financial assistance. That bank is
now called NCNB Texas National Bank.
   ``The Federal Reserve may look unfavorably upon the acquisition
by NCNB of another bank given the fact that they recently received
federal assistance to acquire First RepublicBank,'' Rosen said.
   Cohen _ who represented Bank of New York in its fight for Irving
_ said Thursday that no negotiations have been held and none are
planned with NCNB. He said the company has not been talking to any
other potential suitor.
   ``It's quite clear Citizens wants to remain independent,'' Cohen
said.
   After Citizens' board rejected NCNB's offer it amended the
company's bylaws to make a takeover more difficult, applying
provisions Georgia's anti-takeover law. Irving relied on a similar
New York law, but lost several key court challenges to the statute.
   Also unlike the Bank of New York-Irving battle, the NCNB
proposal reaches across state lines.
   ``It's likely that there will be a lot more politics involved in
this battle ... (because) it's likely it would result in the
reduction of jobs,'' said Rosen. ``NCNB has a very strong track
record of cutting costs and reducing staff.''
   While NCNB's proposal calls for continuation of Citizens and
Southern's management and independent operations, banking experts
said they were doubtful NCNB would be a hands-off partner.
   ``First RepublicBank is a prime example. After they (NCNB) took
that over they changed the name,'' said Stephen Biggar, an analyst
with Argus Research.

   The stock market lapsed into a sluggish decline
Thursday as investors cautiously awaited monthly statistics on
employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 12.83 points to
2,291.97.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with

   The dollar was generally higher in listless
trading Thursday as the foreign exchange markets awaited fresh
economic figures from Washington.
   Gold prices advanced slightly. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a bid of $383.60 for a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m.
EDT, up 30 cents from late Wednesday's $383.30.
   The dollar moved in a narrow range as many traders in New York
chose to sit out the session and wait for Friday's release of
unemployment figures for March.
   If the report from the Labor Department shows continued economic
strength, the dollar could rise on the expectation that interest
rates will continue to go up. Higher U.S. interest rates are
bullish for the dollar because they make the U.S. currency more
attractive to foreign investors.
   Traders were also cautious ahead of next week's release of U.S.
trade deficit figures for February, said Robert Ryan, a senior
trader with Irving Trust Co.
   A dealer in Frankfurt said the dollar held at the same rate for
five hours during trading there. ``Nothing is happening. ... No one
knows which way the dollar should go,'' he said.
   The dollar began its day in Tokyo, where it closed at 132.15
Japanese yen, up from 131.37 yen. Later in London, the dollar
traded lower at 132.08 yen, but the U.S. currency moved higher in
New York, closing at 132.275 yen, up from 131.555 yen late
Wednesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7035 late Thursday, more
expensive for buyers than Wednesday's late $1.7028. But the pound
slipped in later New York trading to $1.7005 from $1.7030 late
Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.8730 West German marks, up from
1.8695; 1.6445 Swiss francs, up from 1.64125; 6.3250 French francs,
up from 6.3090; 1,373.50 Italian lire, up from 1,371.00; and
1.19325 Canadian dollars, up from 1.19075.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.8700 West German marks, up from 1.8695;
1.6415 Swiss francs, up from 1.6395; 6.3125 French francs, down
from 6.3150; 2.1090 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1125; 1,371.75
Italian lire, down from 1,372.50, and 1.1935 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1895.
   Gold bullion prices were higher, but traders said there was
little interest in the metal. In London, gold traded at a late bid
price of $384.75 a troy ounce, up from $383.50 on Wednesday. The
late Zurich price was bid at $384.35 an ounce, up from $383.35.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell to $384.05 an ounce from $387.25
Wednesday.
   In New York, a troy ounce of gold for current delivery closed at

   Peter Ueberroth's deal to buy strike-ravaged
Eastern Airlines got a boost from two sources that have been
getting a black eye from prosecutors: junk-bond powerhouse Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. and its indicted financier, Michael R. Milken.
   Ueberroth, the ex-baseball commissioner, told reporters at a
Thursday news conference to announce the deal with Eastern parent
Texas Air Corp. that Milken called him two weeks earlier and
offered constructive ideas on how to proceed.
   He did not specify what those ideas were but quoted Milken as
strongly advising him to ``focus on the jobs.''
   Ueberroth also put in a good word for Drexel, the nation's
fifth-largest investment banking firm that has played crucial roles
in some of the biggest takeovers of the decade.
   ``Maybe some of you don't want to here this but I think it's
essential,'' Ueberroth said. ``The company _ Texas Air, not us _
retained Drexel Burnham Lambert and they have been helpful in this
transaction on the company side and will be, overall, helpful to
complete the transaction.''
   Under the arrangement outlined by Ueberroth and Texas Air,
Drexel will provide $300 million in debt-financing for the deal,
which has been valued at $464 million.
   Drexel and Milken have been battling negative publicity since
they were implicated in wide-ranging securities fraud by
now-imprisoned speculator Ivan Boesky more than two years ago.
   Drexel agreed to plead guilty to six fraud felony charges in
December, and a grand jury indicted Milken and two others on fraud
and racketeering charges March 29. Milken has asserted innocence.
   Steven Anreder, a spokesman for Drexel, said he was unaware of
Ueberroth's remarks and could not comment further. Officials at
Robinson Lake Lerer and Montgomery, the public relations firm hired
by Milken to speak for him, would not comment.
   Eastern's employees struck March 4 after a prolonged feud with
Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo, whom they accused of stripping
the airline's assets, eliminating jobs and scheming to crush the
unions.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy refuge March 9 and Lorenzo peddled it
for sale.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended March 27, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally
adjusted $3,079.9 billion from a revised $3,085.3 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$3,962.8 billion from $3,965.8 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $787.1 billion from $786.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,072.1 billion, a 2.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,937.4 billion, up 4 percent, while M1 was
flat at an average of $787.1 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $511 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$491 million in the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net free reserves totaled $1,049
million in the two weeks ended April 5, up from a revised $328
million a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $288.2 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $289.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>New Pricing Policy Propels Sears' Sales Growth</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Retailing giant Sears, Roebuck and Co. Thursday reported robust
sales growth for the first month of its new low-pricing policy but
analysts said it will take many months to judge whether Sears'
determination to beat competitors is paying off.
   Sears said its sales rose 11.9 percent in the five weeks ended
April 1 to $2.97 billion from $2.66 billion in the corresponding
period a year earlier.
   Sales at Sears stores open for at least a year increased a solid
9.6 percent during the five weeks. The industry considers these
same-store sales a better measure of a retailer's performance than
totals that includes the take at newly opened stores.
   Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive officer of Sears
Merchandise Group, said the March volume turned out even better
than the company had hoped.
   ``Clearly, everyday low prices are well-understood and popular
with the public and we are pleased with the response to our
strategy,'' Bozic said.
   The launch of its ``everyday low price'' program, which was
promoted with an aggressive advertising campaign estimated by
outsiders to have cost about $110 million, definitely brought more
customers into Sears stores.
   Joseph Ronning, a retail specialist with Brown Bros. Harriman,
said the sales growth was a ``reflection of people experimenting to
see what Sears everyday low pricing is like.''
   ``It shows people are going into the stores to find out what's
happening,'' he said.
   One of the strongest points to make about Sears' latest
same-store sales were that they rose 15.4 percent after adjustment
for the loss of 2{ selling days due to Easter and the closing of
Sears' more than 800 stores nationwide for marking down prices in
preparation for the policy switch, Ronning said.
   The markdowns were part of a broad effort by Sears to hoist its
sagging merchandise operation. The retailer also is adding national
brands to its mostly private-label lineup and cutting costs to
recapture lost market share.
   Sears, which maintained its ranking as the country's biggest
retailer with 1988 revenue of $30.3 billion, has watched its market
share shrink this decade as go-go discounters such as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and specialty merchants have developed significant
followings among shoppers.
   Industry analysts said the test will be whether Sears manages to
maintain the sales momentum, especially after the fan-fare over the
changes adopted by the 102-year-old retailer dies down. Sears'
advertising already has returned to a more normal level.
   Karen Sack, a retail analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., said
Sears definitely enjoyed a far better month than many of the other
retailers that reported results on Thursday.
   No.2 retailer K mart Corp., for instance, described its sales as
``disappointing'' and blamed the weather, in part.
   Analysts said some of the weakness in sales at K mart and other
chain stores may have been the result of all the hoopla generated
by Sears policy shift but it is difficult to quantify precisely how
much sales revenue might have been taken away by Sears.
   ``It will really take the better part of a year to determine
whether their new policy is really taking hold,'' Sack said.
   Analysts are awaiting an indication if Sears' bottom line is
benefiting from the reduced prices.
   A Sears spokeswoman said the company has been mum about
predicting any impact on its earnings.

   Taking advantage of strike-hobbled Eastern
Airline's absence in some lucrative markets, American Airlines
announced plans Thursday to add 11 flights in Miami and 13 in the
Caribbean by June.
   The expansion had been part of American's long-term planning,
but the timing was pushed ahead by the Machinists union strike that
has left Eastern flying only about 10 percent of its schedule since
March 4.
   Eastern's potential for returning to full operation with Peter
Ueberroth's group announcing a deal Thursday to buy the Miami-based
carrier didn't bother American.
   ``The likelihood is that Eastern will still be the largest
carrier'' in the region, said Robert Baker, American's senior vice
president for operations. ``None of what we have announced today
will rise and fall on what happens to Eastern Airlines or anyone
else.''
   American is expanding from 20 to 31 flights a day in Miami and
from 45 to 52 flights a day in San Juan, Puerto Rico, adding other
flights from domestic points to the Caribbean and switching to
larger aircraft on 11 Caribbean flights for a total addition of
3,219 seats per day, Baker said.
   Service from Boston, Philadelphia and New Orleans also would be
added if American wins federal and foreign approval for requested
flights to Bogota, Colombia; Guatemala Cit, Guatemala; San Jose,
Costa Rica, and Grand Cayman Island, he said.
   The expansion will give American 94 daily departures from 10
Florida cities, well behind Delta Airlines and Eastern's old
schedule.
   ``American is building here in Miami for the long-term, and
clearly a large part of our future revolves around Florida and the
Caribbean,'' Baker said.
   The Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier has more than 300 aircraft
on order and will have 485 in service as of Friday with the
addition of its newest A-300 Airbus, he said.

   Cocoa futures prices fell sharply Thursday because of concerns
about large supplies, while grain futures finished mixed after
choppy trading.
   On other futures markets, energy prices were mixed, livestock
and meat slumped and precious metals were fairly steady.
   The May contract for cocoa tumbled $50 a ton at mid-session,
then recovered to finish down $35 on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa
Exchange in New York.
   ``Especially in the nearby months, it was a major loss here
today,'' said Arthur Stevenson, analyst in New York with
Prudential-Bache Securities. ``This is really a depressed market.''
   Traders are seeing ``a negative global supply-demand balance, an
increase in the availability of physical cocoa, especially cocoa
originating in West Africa. And there's a narrowing of cash-futures
prices.''
   It was reported Thursday that Ghana expects to be able to meet
increased demands for its crop.
   Cocoa settled $10 to $35 lower, with the contract for delivery
in May at $1,300 a ton.
   Most futures prices for soybeans and corn were higher while
wheat was mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``It was a choppy market, very quiet,'' said Jerry Zusel, CBOT
floor operations manager for Balfour Maclaine Corp. ``It's not an
exciting time down here.''
   Corn prices were supported by the announcement that the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 200,000 metric tons of U.S. corn,
said research director Jerry Gidel of LIT America Inc.
   While most soybean contracts were higher, reduced domestic
demands and increasing supplies from South America weighed on the
May contract, which was off a penny at the close, Zusel said.
   Wheat was depressed by the lack of fresh export news, analysts
said.
   Wheat settled 2 cents higher to 3} cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.00{ a bushel; corn was 1{ cents
to 3\ cents higher, with May at $2.65{ a bushel; oats were 2 cents
to 3} cents higher, with May at $1.86} a bushel; and soybeans were
1 cent lower to 5{ cents higher, with May at $7.14 a bushel.
   Most livestock and meat futures prices were lower on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   ``There are a lot of bellies in storage and the cash price is
lower,'' said Dale Benson, a livestock analyst in Chicago with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He said traders were caught by surprise by a price plunge in the
cattle complex, although there has been a recent trend of ``buying
hogs and selling cattle.''
   Cattle settled .38 cent to .52 cent lower, with the contract for
April at 77.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .70 cent lower to
1.20 cents lower, with April at 78.67 cents a pound; live hogs were
.07 cent to .60 cent higher, with April at 39.97 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .52 cent higher to .40 cent lower, with
May at 34.40 cents a pound.
   Precious metals were steady on the Commodity Exchange in New
York as traders await Friday's national unemployment figures.
   ``It was very quiet, with traders taking a wait and see
attitude. The dollar had little effect,'' said Peter Cardillo of
Josephthal &amp; Co.
   Gold usually moves in the opposite direction of the dollar.
   Gold settled 10 cents to 20 cents higher, with the contract for
delivery in April at $384 a troy ounce; and silver was .2 cent
higher to .5 cent lower, with April at $5.80 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures prices were mixed on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Analysts said the market was pausing after last week's huge
run-up following the Alaskan oil spill disaster.
   Crude oil settled 48 cents higher to 19 cents lower, with the
contract for delivery in May at $19.80 a barrel; heating oil was
.27 cent higher to .41 cent lower, with May at 51.22 cents a
gallon; and unleaded gasoline was 1 cent to 1.88 cents lower, with
May at 64.55 cents a gallon.

<TEXT>
   About 300 striking Eastern Airlines workers and
their supporters rallied outside an American Express Co. travel
office Thursday to protest an internal memo naming Continental
Airlines a preferred carrier.
   The memo obtained by the striking Machinists union asks
Atlanta-area travel agents to follow a priority list of carriers
when booking customers who give no preference.
   The March 22 letter from American Express' Membership Travel
Service in Atlanta ends by saying, ``Please keep this information
confidential and do not discuss with anyone outside of our
organization.''
   For domestic service, the memo says its ``highly preferred''
domestic carriers, in order, are American, USAir-Piedmont,
Eastern's sister carrier Continental and Delta airlines.
   For Pacific routes, Northwest, Continental, JAL, United and
Qantas airlines are preferred.
   TWA and Singapore Airlines are specifically excluded from all
lists.
   ``A lot of our people carry American Express cards, and they're
appalled that American Express is aligning itself with Frank
Lorenzo,'' chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp., said Russ
McGarry, a Machinists vice president. ``It's really hard to
understand.''
   American Express books with Continental because of the airline's
special offers, said company spokesman Nancy Muller in New York.
   ``Like most other travel agencies, we have some special
relationships with a number of airlines so we can get even better
service,'' such as access to better seats and fares, she said.
   Chuck Groves, manager of the picketed travel office, said the
Atlanta memo did not govern operations in his office, and he
followed no priority list for booking flights.
   Striking Eastern workers have been trying to get fliers to
boycott Continental since the strike began March 4 because of their
common ownership.

   Federal regulators took over 38 more savings
and loan associations in eight states Thursday, bringing the total
under government control to 215 in 31 states.
   The institutions _ in California, Colorado, Iowa, Illinois,
Kansas, Missouri, Mississippi and Texas _ were the latest to be
taken over in a program being administered by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   The FDIC, which regulates commercial banks, is going into the
sickest S&amp;Ls with the goal of minimizing losses until Congress
appropriates the money to shut them down or sell them to new owners.
   The first legislative votes were taken on the S&amp;L bailout
legislation on Thursday when members of a House Banking
subcommittee began considering 165 proposed amendments.
   The FDIC began the takeover program at the direction of
President Bush on Feb. 7 and plans to assume control of 17 more
institutions within the next few weeks.
   In announcing the latest S&amp;L takeovers on Thursday, the FDIC
emphasized that the institutions will remain open as usual and that
all deposits are guaranteed up to the $100,000 insurance limit.
   The FDIC said that the regulatory oversight teams being put into
the institutions would work to minimize operating losses and ensure
that the institutions were operated in a safe and sound manner.
   The largest of the 38 institutions taken over on Thursday was
Murray Savings Association of Dallas with assets of $1.44 billion
at the end of 1988. Of the institutions handled Thursday, 12 were
located in California and 11 in Texas.
   The 38 institutions included:
   CALIFORNIA: Cabrillo Savings Bank, Hayward; Founders Savings and
Loan Association, Los Angeles; Royal Oak Savings and Loan
Association, Manteca; Unified Savings Association, Northridge; City
Federal Savings and Loan Association, Oakland; First California
Federal Savings Association, Orange; Arrowhead Pacific Savings
Bank, San Bernardino; Gateway Savings Bank, San Francisco;
Perpetual Savings Association, Santa Ana; Washington Savings sand
Loan Association, Stockton; Independence Savings and Loan
Association, Vallejo; City Savings and Loan Association, Westlake
Villa.
   COLORADO: American Federal Savings and Loan Association of
Colorado, Denver; Equity Federal Savings Bank of Denver.

   Energy futures were mostly lower in moderate
trading Thursday, led by falling gasoline prices as oil shipments
in Alaska returned to normal.
   Unleaded gasoline had risen more than 13 cents since the giant
spill off the Alaskan coast on March 24.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, unleaded gasoline for May
delivery dropped 1.88 cents to 64.55 cents a gallon from 66.43 a
gallon on Wednesday. Other contract months were mixed.
   The May contract for heating oil fell .41 cent to 51.22 cents
from 51.63 cents in the previous session, while other contracts
also declined.
   Meanwhile, the May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of crude oil, settled down 19 cents at $19.80 a
barrel.
   Analysts said gasoline prices were in for a technical correction
after soaring in the week following the oil spill and the closure
of the port of Valdez.
   ``Prices reflected mostly a technical change rather than
anything fundamental,'' said Richard Redoglio, energy broker with
Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Analysts said oil shipments from the Valdez port exceeded 1.3
million barrels on Thursday while 2 million barrels are normally
shipped.

<TEXT>
   Congress, under the cloud of $9.4 billion in
fresh deposit withdrawals from the nation's savings and loan
institutions, began amending President Bush's bailout bill Thursday
and immediately got into a dispute over reopening some of last
year's deals that provided $38 billion to the industry.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized control
Thursday of 38 more S&amp;Ls at or near insolvency, raising to 215 the
number of troubled thrifts that the agency has put into
conservatorships since early February in an effort to prevent the
bailout costs from mushrooming.
   On a bipartisan vote, the House Banking subcommittee on
financial institutions moved immediately to deny Bush some of the
controls he had sought over officials running the government's
deposit insurance program.
   The subcommittee also amended Bush's proposal by transferring
regulatory oversight of state-chartered but federally insured S&amp;Ls
from the Federal Home Loan Bank Board to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
   Bush in February proposed transferring authority over federally
chartered thrifts from the bank board to the FDIC, which regulates
commercial banks.
   But the committee rejected an amendment by Democratic Rep.
Richard Lehman to allow 31 of the nation's largest thrifts, many of
them in his home state of California, to become banks and escape
future insurance liability for the costs of the S&amp;L bailout.
   The panel also balked temporarily at an effort by Rep. Doug
Barnard Jr., D-Ga., to prevent the government from recovering some
of the billions of dollars in long-term aid it committed last year
to buyers of 179 insolvent thrifts.
   Subcommittee members also questioned the legality of many of
last year's bailouts, saying the bank board had committed billions
of dollars Congress had not authorized it to spend.
   Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas., said
some of those deals were with multimillionaires who put up little
or none of their own money.
   In one December transaction, government aid exceeded the nearly
$6 billion combined costs of the 1970s bailouts of New York City
and the Lockheed Corp. and the 1980 bailout of Chrysler Corp.,
according to auditors.
   Barnard, in the face of strong opposition, temporarily withdrew
his amendment to prevent the government from seeking to recover
from holding companies some of the subsidies the FSLIC had promised
to S&amp;L purchasers.
   But he complained that ``all of a sudden we are weaseling on
commitments that were made.''
   In all the subcommittee has before it 165 proposed amendments to
the administration's proposal.
   The bank board, meanwhile, released figures showing that
depositors removed $9.4 billion from the S&amp;Ls in February, the
fourth straight month of heavy withdrawals.
   The nation's 2,939 thrifts hold $957 billion in deposits.
Withdrawals since October total $35.4 billion.
   January's withdrawals amounted to $10.6 billion, according to
revised figures. Bank board officials attributed the February
slowdown in the outflow to higher interest rates being offered by
many S&amp;Ls.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady has said he expects the
withdrawals to stop if Congress approves Bush's bailout plan,
estimated to cost at least $157 billion and, perhaps, more than
$200 billion over the next 10 years, depending on economic
conditions.
   The subcommittee adopted by voice vote an amendment providing
four-year terms to the chairman and vice chairman of the FDIC,
which under Bush's plan would take over insuring S&amp;L deposits from
the bank board's insolvent Federal and Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp. (FSLIC).
   Currently, the chairman of the FDIC _ now William Seidman _ is
chosen by its other two board members. Bush wanted to have the
chairman report to the secretary of the treasury, who could hire
and fire the chairman at will.
   ``A lot of the problem (in) where we are now is the lack of
independence by regulatory agencies,'' said Rep. Peter Hoagland,
D-Neb., one of the sponsors of the amendment.
   Bush also would leave the bank board and its chairman, M. Danny
Wall, as the primary federal regulators of state-chartered S&amp;Ls.
But, in an indication of disappointment with the way Wall has done
his job, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, won a 35-12 vote on his amendment
to transfer that power to the FDIC.
   Lehman's amendment to exempt the 31 large S&amp;Ls from a
Bush-proposed five-year moratorium on leaving the thrift insurance
fund to escape the higher premiums it charges in relation to what
banks pay for deposit coverage was defeated on a 28-17 vote.
   ``If you let those folks out, you are telling the taxpayers back
home you want them to pay more of the burden,'' said Rep. Gerald
Kleczka, D-Wis., who noted that the 31 thrifts hold about
one-fourth of all S&amp;L deposits in the country.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., plans
to complete the bill next week and then send it to the full
committee, where Gonzalez has indicated he may give it lengthy
consideration.
   All but four members of the full committee serve on the
subcommittee.
   In the Senate, the legislation appears to moving at a faster
pace, although so far it all has been dealt with only in closed
sessions in anticipation of formal open meetings next week.
   There, the Banking Committee chairman, Sen. Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., told colleagues that Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, intends to have the Senate vote on the bill during the
week of April 17.
   The Senate panel is scheduled to begin amending Bush's package
next Tuesday and Wednesday, when Annunzio's House subcommittee will
resume its deliberations.
   In other action on amendments Thursday, the House panel:
   _Rejected on a 39-7 vote a measure by Reps. Paul E. Kanjorski,
D-Pa., and Marcy Kaptur, D-Pa., aimed at making states where much
of the problems have occurred _ chiefly Texas and Florida _ raise
state taxes to pay 20 percent of the bailout costs for
state-chartered thrifts that went belly up.
   Kaptur blamed loose regulations in those states for 74 percent
of the S&amp;L aid committed by the government last year, saying the
costs of bailing out Texas institutions alone will total three
times what the United States spent on the Marshall plan in
rebuilding Europe after World War II.
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said the amendment would have
sent the bill to ``Fort Sumter and started a second civil war.''
And, referring to Bush, Leach questioned whether ``there is a
slight chance that a Texan in the White House could sign'' the bill
with such a provision.
   _Approved on a voice vote a compromise worked out with lobbyists
for bankers and thrifts a measure that will allow both federally
insured banks and S&amp;Ls to use the same insurance logo but with
different names.
   _Defeated a measure aimed at preventing banks from citing the
poor condition of the S&amp;L insurance pool in their advertisements to
lure deposits from thrifts.
   _Defeated an amendment by Barnard that would have ordered the
FDIC to increase the pay of bank and S&amp;L examiners by 20 percent at
an annual cost of $14 million. Barnard said those examiners are
leaving those jobs at rate of 12 percent a year because their
annual pay averages less than $40,000.

   The U.S. dollar opened marginally lower againt the
Japanese yen Friday while share prices rebounded moderately in
morning trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar, which gained 0.78 yen Thursday, opened at 132.10
yen, down 0.05 yen from the previous day's close.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 365.01-point
loser Thursday, gained 55.12 points, or 0.17 percent, during the
first 15 minutes of trading Friday.
   Currency dealers said they expected quiet trading throughout the
day ahead of the release of unemployment figures in the United
States, scheduled for Friday in Washington.
   ``In a general trend, the dollar remains bullish mainly because
of the gap in interest rates between the U.S. and Japan,'' said a
dealer at Sumitomo Bank. ``The unstable political situation in
Japan is also expected to promote the yen's decline for some time.''
   Securities dealers said investors are trying to determine the
direction of the market, after the Nikkei index's sharp drop
Thursday following a nearly 1,800-point gain from the start of this
week.

   Jubilant Eastern Airlines strikers cheered and sang
``Take Me Out to The Ball Game'' when an agreement to sell the
carrier was announced Thursday, saying they are ready to tighten
their belts and show the public what they can do.
   Details of the proposed sale to a group led by ex-baseball
commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth are still unclear. The deal would
give Eastern employees a 30 percent share of the airline in
exchange for pay cuts and other union concessions possibly totaling
$250 million.
   If the union leaders approve, the rank and file say they are
willing to live on less to prove they can run an airline better
than Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo. And, they say, they
have shown that an employee's human rights must be respected.
   ``Whatever happens here at Eastern is going to dictate what
happens with the rest of the airlines, and in other industries
too,'' said mechanic Frank Martinez. ``We had been stripped of our
dignity while we were working for Frank Lorenzo _ now we have it
back, and we are going to rebuild the airline.''
   Martinez, whose wife Alice is a flight attendant at Eastern,
said he has no illusions that they can live as well as before the
strike.
   ``It will be painful,'' Martinez said. ``We have to deprive
ourselves of many things we had in the past, but the most important
thing is that we are building for the future.''
   Employees universally blamed Lorenzo's attitude toward workers,
not wage disputes, for the atmosphere of crisis that culminated in
the March 4 stirke. And they said they were glad to see him go.
   ``It looks like mighty Casey has struck out,'' laughed Sal
Fallavollita, an Eastern pilot for 26 years. ``We are ready to
accept concessions _ if that's what the new management wants, I'll
go along with it.''
   Ramp service worker Jose Lorie said the price of the 34-day
walkout was expensive, both to the employees and the airline itself.
   ``We know the airline has been hurt _ how much, we'll have to
find out,'' Lorie said. ``We just have to go out there with the
best possible mentality.''
   Not everyone was ecstatic about the sale, with some saying they
want to see the fine print.
   ``I've seen so much deception that I'm not going to pick up my
tools until I've seen (the contract),'' said Julio Valentine, a
maintenance worker for 23 years. But he said he was willing to make
concessions to Ueberroth.
   Most echoed the sentiments of Stephanie Orent, a mechanic who
rocked her little girl in a stroller as she listened to the excited
chatter at the union hall.
   ``Even if we don't all go back to work, for those who do, it's
the greatest,'' she said. ``Lorenzo's gone, he's gone back to
wherever he came from, and we don't want to see him again.''

<HEAD>Kimberly Clark Announces New Disposable Training Pants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kimberly Clark Corp. on Wednesday announced it
will begin making disposable training pants for toddlers, designed
for the 4 million children who annually outgrow their need for
diapers and begin toilet training.
   Darwin E. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer of
Kimberly Clark, said the product, which has been in development for
five years, will carry the name ``Huggies Pull-Ups.''
   ``They provide the absorption and protection of a disposable
diaper, but look like children's underwear and are worn like
underwear,'' Smith said.
   He said the pants will first be available in Arizona, Colorado
and parts of Wyoming, while distribution would be expanded when
production capacity permits.
   Kimberly Clark's Paris, Texas, plant was expanded by 300,000
feet to make room for new production lines to make the pants. Since
Jan. 1, the plant has added 135 workers to handle the new product.

<HEAD>Trial On Insider-Trading A Landmark, SEC Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wisconsin man has been convicted of profiting
from insider stock trading in the first such case the Securities
and Exchange Commission has taken before a jury.
   After deliberating for about 90 minutes Tuesday, the U.S.
District Court jury found John Clark III of Cedarburg, Wis.,
violated civil securities laws when he bought stock in a company
knowing his employer was negotiating to buy that company.
   The six-person jury found no violation on the part of Russell
VanMoppes, a broker in the Bellevue office of Piper, Jaffray &amp;
Hopwood, who executed Clark's stock purchases.
   No criminal charges were brought in the case and none are
pending, said Jim Kidney, an SEC attorney from Washington, D.C.,
who tried the case before U.S. District Judge Thomas Zilly.
   ``This is the first insider-trading case the SEC has ever tried
before a jury,'' Kidney said.
   The U.S. Supreme Court recently ruled that the SEC may seek
insider-trading penalties in addition to the return of illegally
obtained profits. But it said such penalties can only be sought
before a jury. Previous insider-trading cases have been tried
before judges alone.
   SEC regulations prohibit profiting on stock trading when it is
based on information not available to the public.
   Clark bought stock in Affiliated Hospital Products Inc. in
December 1984 after he learned his employer, Smith &amp; Nephew
Associated Cos., was negotiating to buy Affiliated for at least 50
percent more than the current market price of the stock, Kidney
said. The shares were traded on the American Stock Exchange.
   Clark bought 3,000 shares at prices ranging from $17.875 to
$19.75 a share. The following month, Smith &amp; Nephew announced its
offer to buy Affiliated for $36 a share. Two days afterward, Clark
sold his shares for $35.125 apiece, realizing a profit of $47,466,
the SEC said.
   Zilly ordered Clark to pay $57,026 as unlawful profits gained by
him, his wife and by VanMoppes. Zilly said he also will set penalty
damages, ranging from one to three times the unlawful profits,
after he receives information on Clark's financial situation.
   The court ``will require a penalty in this case to demonstrate
to this defendant and to the world that insider trading will not be
tolerated,'' Zilly said.
   Kidney said VanMoppes recommended the Affiliated stock to
another client and later bought some himself, based on information
from Clark. The SEC had alleged VanMoppes had used insider
information, but the jury found VanMoppes was not liable under
insider-trading laws.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Share Prices Plunge</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Updates with morning Nikkei, comments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices plunged Thursday morning on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, while the U.S. dollar traded higher against the
Japanese yen.
   The dollar, which opened at 131.93 yen, up 0.56 yen from
Wednesday's 131.37-yen close, inched down to 131.90 yen by late
morning. The currency traded in the range of 131.75-131.98 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 48.54 points to
close a record-high 33,367.09 Wednesday, fell sharply. It finished
the morning session at 33,167.30, down 193.49 points or 0.58
percent.
   ``Most investors have been concerned about the continuous sharp
increases in the market's key index and slowed down their buying,
while others sold issues for profit-taking,'' said a dealer with
Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Other dealers said institutional investors, who began
participating actively in the market's bull run in the last several
days, returned to the sidelines Thursday due to concerns over
political instability following news reports of Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita's alleged involvement in a major scandal.
   In currency dealings, investors' demand for the dollar remained
strong, but participants were wary of pushing beyond the 132-yen
range, feari above 133 yen would trigger yen-support
intervention by Japan'central bank, traders said.
   A trader at a commercial bank, ing on condition of
anonymity, said Takeshita's political troubles also were
discouraging yen purchases.
   Takeshita, whose administration is under fire for its links to
Recruit Co., the job informationmerate at the scandal's
center, suffered a major blow Wednesdayts that he had
received $380,000 from the firm ng parties held in May
1987.
   The company came under investigation for suspected bribery after
it was disclosed that it sold hundreds of thousands of unlisted
shares of its real estate subsidiary at discount prices to 159
influential people. The recipients of the netted substantial
profits after over-the-counter trading began.
