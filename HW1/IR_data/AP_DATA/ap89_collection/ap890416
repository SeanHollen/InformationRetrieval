   Jocko Conlan, a National League umpire
for 24 years, died Sunday at age 89.
   Conlan, known as one of the fiestier umpires of his day, in 1974
was the fifth umpire inducted into the Hall of Fame.
   Conlan umpired in five World Series and six All-Star Games
before retiring after the 1964 season. Before umpiring, he was a
player for 14 seasons, but made it up to the major leagues for only
two years, playing for the Chicago White Sox in 1934 and 1935.
   ``Right or wrong, the umpire's always the villain,'' Conlan once
said. ``That's the way it's been for 100 years and you learn to
take it. Ballplayers do dumb things. Day in, day out, they throw to
the wrong base. Nobody boos. We call a close one and 40,000
scream.''

   The scars on Hilario Bustamante's
back are a year old now, reminders of the armed men who abducted
and tortured him, then left him for dead.
   His story is an example of what Roman Catholic priests, lawyers
and civil rights workers say are continuing, widespread violations
of human rights despite President Corazon Aquino's oft-stated
commitment to social justice.
   Bustamante, now 19, says he and a companion were grabbed on a
Manila street in March 1988 while putting up posters protesting
U.S. military bases. He says they were taken to a military
garrison, tortured, driven to a remote field and dumped.
   His companion was found dead and police say they still have no
leads. Bustamante fears for his life and has given up pursuing the
case.
   Mrs. Aquino denies that her government sanctions such abuse. The
military says it is weeding out offenders and indoctrinating
soldiers out of respect for human rights.
   In December, however, the human rights organization Amnesty
International reported ``a pattern of torture'' in the Philippines
as a result of the government's intensified campaign against
communist insurgents.
   Critics of Mrs. Aquino say she is reluctant to crack down on
abuses by the military because she needs loyal officers to remain
in power and fulfill her pledge to crush the rebels.
   Some claim violations of human rights are more widespread now
than under Ferdinand E. Marcos, who was driven into exile in
February 1986 by the military-civilian uprising that put Mrs.
Aquino in office.
   Task Force Detainees, affiliated with the Catholic church, says
8,367 people were detained in 1987 on suspicion of links to rebel
groups, compared with 5,967 reported arrested in 1985, the last
full year Marcos was in office. It claims one of four arrested are
tortured.
   The organization documented 98 massacres in 1987 compared with
54 in 1985, including 17 people slain in Lupao in February 1987 and
at least 13 protesters killed during a Manila march for land reform
in January 1987.
   Although the military acknowledges soldiers were responsible,
there have been no convictions in either case.
   Her own government's Commission on Human Rights says only 12
people have been convicted of human rights violations since Mrs.
Aquino replaced Marcos.
   Amnesty's report blamed the abuses on military and paramilitary
units, including hundreds of anti-communist vigilante groups
organized since 1987 to help fight the rebels.
   The president called the report unfair, but those active in the
human rights movement say little is done to identify and punish
offenders. Victims usually keep silent for fear of reprisal.
   Priests and lawyers say the military frequently calls a whole
village communist if rebels operate in the area and chooses
civilians for arrest and torture on flimsy evidence.
   Leticia Buenaseda, a lawyer for the Commission on Human Rights
on Samar Island, said she received threats from the military and
soldiers ransacked her office after she began investigating the
disappearances of several civilians. Six human rights lawyers have
been killed since October 1987.
   An Irish priest in Mindanao, the Rev. Michael Sinnot, said the
army's conduct was driving civilians into the insurgent ranks.
   He described the military as ``the best recruiting agency'' for
the rebels.
   ``For every abuse they commit, for every one person they kill,
they recruit five people more,'' Sinnot said.
   Human rights activists fear the situation will get worse as the
army deploys a new civilian militia called the Citizens Armed
Forces Geographical Unit.
   Military officials say the 50,000 militiamen will be sent to
remote villages to improve security but will be under tight
control. Critics claim the militias and vigilante groups are
virtual ``death squads.''
   Augusto Sanchez, a human rights lawyer and former Aquino labor
minister, said police and soldiers go after anyone with liberal or
leftist views.
   ``The `red scare' has generated feelings among the right-wing
forces, the military and the police that anybody tainted or
communist-branded is due for liquidation,'' he said.
   The Rev. Rafael Donato, chairman of the Association of Major
Religious Superiors, said he referred several cases to Mrs. Aquino,
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos and the chief of staff, Gen. Renato
de Villa, with no results.
   ``All of them said `we will investigate, we will investigate, we
will investigate,' but nothing happens,'' he said.
   Many of Mrs. Aquino's critics blame the influence of the
military, which grew as Ramos and others put down six coup attempts
and army activity against the insurgents increased.
   Ramos was chief of staff when the coups were crushed. Under
Marcos he commanded the Philippine Constabulary, the national
police force believed responsible for most of the violations, but
never was personally identified with human rights abuse.
   Soon after gaining power, Mrs. Aquino established the Commission
on Human Rights. Its only recourse, however, is to refer cases to
military courts, which have sole power to prosecute soldiers even
when the victims are civilians.
   ``While there were attempts to fulfill promises, I believe she
was shocked into submission by the series of coups d'etat,'' said
Arnel de Guzman, chairman of the Ecumenical Movement for Justice
and Peace. ``She is a hostage of the military or some other
forces.''
   Hesiquio Mallilin, a former human rights lawyer who heads the
human rights commission, acknowledged that abuses have continued,
but said his agency ``is doing its best to improve the situation.''
   The Rev. Brendan O'Connell, an Irish priest on Negros island,
said of Mrs. Aquino's image abroad: ``They see this lovely person
and say, `This is not true because human rights is the policy of
this government.'''
   At home, he said, ``People from the ... slum areas, they say,
`This beautiful woman is like the Baby Jesus, who will save us.'
   ``That's why I think she's part of the problem.''

   A newspaper reported Sunday that the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 was conceived during a meeting last year between
Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, a Palestinian group and Iran's
Revolutionary Guards.
   The Sunday Telegraph attributed its information to U.S.
intelligence sources. The Palestinian group, the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine-General Command headed by Ahmed Jibril,
has been a prime suspect in the bombing.
   The newspaper said U.S. intelligence officers tracked and
monitored the meeting early last year in Libya, where the
participants discussed the coordination of their operations against
U.S. targets.
   It said Libyan officials in Europe provided logistical support
for the bombing, which was planned and carried out by the
Palestinian group.
   ``U.S. officials believe they now have the names of members of
the terror network,'' the newspaper said. ``The crisis looming
before President Bush is what he does about it.''
   It did not elaborate on the purported participation of the
Revolutionary Guards, the fanatical corps formed by Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A bomb ripped apart the Boeing 747 over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie on Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard the jumbo jet
and 11 on the ground.
   Another British newspaper, the Observer, reported Sunday that
Pan Am has refused to disclose to U.S. investigators details of a
review of its own security carried out by hired consultants two
years ago.
   The weekly said it had obtained sections of the report by the
Israeli security consultants KPI, which it said criticized what it
called Pan Am's ``misguided security concept'' and warned the
airline was ``highly vulnerable to most forms of terrorism.''
   The newspaper said KPI, hired in 1987 at a cost of $460,000,
recommended security improvements on Pan Am airliners. But it said
that according to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Government
Activities and Transportation, the consultants' advice had not been
acted on before Lockerbie.
   The newspaper said the subcommittee's investigation into Pan
Am's failure to act on warnings issued before the disaster has been
severely hampered by the refusal of the airline and the Federal
Aviation Administration to release vital information.
   It said Pan Am has argued that to answer many of the committee's
questions would be ``detrimental'' to its security and would
prejudice its position in litigation with relatives of the victims.

   A senior military commander Saturday
ordered troops to guard against possible terrorist attacks at U.S.
military bases on the third anniversary of the American air raid in
Libya.
   Maj. Gen. Ramon Montano, chief of the Philippine Constabulary,
gave the order in a radio message to field units stationed near
U.S. military bases.
   Montano said American authorities advised that terrorist groups
might attack Clark Air Base, Subic Bay Naval Base and four other
smaller military installations to mark the April 15, 1986 U.S. air
raid on Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya. He told military commanders to
``institute appropriate security measures'' around the American
facilities.
   At least 41 people were killed during the air raids on Libya,
and two American airmen died when their plane was shot down over
Tripoli. The attack was in retaliation for the April 5, 1986
bombing of a discoteque in West Berlin that killed two people,
including a U.S. serviceman, and wounded 200.
   Montano said last week's attack by communist New People's Army
rebels on a U.S. communications station in northern Benguet
province and the discovery of a wire bomb near Clark have caused
the U.S. Embassy concern.
   The rebels destroyed a giant antenna and three utility poles in
the attack on the station. Rebels said the attack was a response to
the ``escalating U.S. military intervention in the country.'' There
were no injuries, and the site remained operational. Rebels did not
claim responsibility for the wire bomb.
   The bombing was the first attack on a U.S. facility or U.S.
personnel since October 1987, when rebels killed three Americans
and a Filipino near Clark.
   The rebels have been fighting the government for 20 years to
establish a communist state in the Philippines.

   Authorities searching Saturday for a
winery worker accused of killing his wife and four other people
found the bodies of two of his daughters, and a third was
discovered alive with her throat cut.
   The bodies were found near a landfill transfer station in
California's wine country, not far from where Ramon Salcido, 28,
fled Friday with his daughters, Teresa, 1; Carmina, 3, and Sofia,
4, authorities said.
   ``We do know in fact they are Salcido's children,'' Sonoma
County Sheriff Richard Michaelsen said of the victims.
Investigators could identify the youngsters from photographs, he
said.
   The surviving child was identified as Carmina, authorities said.
She was in stable condition after surgery at Petaluma Valley
Hospital in Petaluma.
   ``It appears her vital signs are stable, and she's going to make
it,'' said Chuck Cowen, a hospital administrator.
   ``She had a cut in her throat that was 5 to 6 inches long, just
above the Adam's apple,'' Cowen said. ``I don't know how deep, but
it was more than superficial.
   ``She was crying when she came in, but was able to make some
sounds,'' he said. The girl suffered damage to her vocal cords but
doctors believe she will recover.
   ``She made indications to investigators that her father cut her
throat and that it occurred sometime last night,'' Sheriff's Lt.
Gary Zanolini said. ``They were apparently dumped over a cliff near
the dump.''
   The three girls were spotted in a ravine near the dump between
Petaluma and Sonoma by a man looking for a tool to pry a camper
shell off a truck, Michaelsen said. The highway patrol was notified
shortly before 3 p.m.
   ``At first he thought they were dolls,'' the sheriff said. The
man, whom he would not identify, went to get a worker from the
dump, and the two found ``yet another horrible scene,'' Michaelsen
said.
   ``I tried to talk to the little girl who was still alive and I
tried to comfort her,'' said Tim Smith, a landfill worker who went
to investigate. ``She tried to speak and she gurgled from her
throat. Her throat was nearly cut from ear to ear.''
   Sheriff's Lt. Chuck Smith said the two slain girls appeared to
have been at the dump ``for some time'' but that it was not known
how they died.
   There was no immediate sign of Salcido, but Smith said
authorities were searching for a brown 1967 Ford station wagon
someone saw near the dump.
   Friday's attacks on Salcido's two sisters-in-law, 8 and 12, in
which both were sexually assaulted and one was nearly decapitated,
had heightened fears for his daughters, who vanished from the house
where his wife was slain. Salcido also allegedly slew his
mother-in-law and a co-worker.
   There was no evidence that Salcido's daughters had been sexually
molested, Michaelsen said.
   Police helicopters searched the pretty wine country north of San
Francisco. Lawmen over most of this 1,000-mile-long state were on
alert for Salcido, whose 10-year-old car was discovered abandoned
20 miles south in San Rafael.
   Investigators received hundreds of calls from people who claimed
to have seen the burly, black-haired Salcido everywhere from Sonoma
County to Los Angeles, 400 miles to the south.
   Authorities on Friday found the battered and slashed bodies of
Salcido's mother-in-law, Marian Louise Richards, 47, and her
children, Marie, 8, and Ruth, 12, inside their blood-splattered
house in Cotati.
   ``It's a butcher shop in there,'' a policeman said after
emerging from the neat, pale yellow home in a well-tended
middle-class neighborhood.
   At the ranch of a prominent grower, Salcido wounded Kenneth
Butti in the shoulder, said Michaelsen. Butti, 33, worked with
Salcido, a forklift operator, at Grand Cru Winery.
   Sheriff's deputies went to the winery, where they found
assistant winemaker Tracey Toovey alongside his car, dead of
gunshot wounds.
   Deputies went to Boyes Hot Springs and found Salcido's wife,
Angela, 24, who apparently had been beaten and stabbed to death,
Michaelsen said.
   Michaelsen said the bloodbath could have been triggered by a
child support case that came to a head last week. Salcido was
ordered to pay $511 a month to his ex-wife, Debra Ann Salcido, and
nearly $6,000 in back payments.
   Ms. Salcido was under police protection Saturday, authorities
said.
   A next-door neighbor said Salcido was fiercely jealous and
habitually drove home from his job during the day to spy on his
wife.
   ``He's crazy, he was always going around with a gun,'' said
Richard Clark. ``I could see it coming.''
   ``One time he threatened to blow (his wife's) head off,'' Clark
said. ``He said if he found someone ... with his wife he'd kill
them. He was real jealous. He drank a lot. Two or three times a day
he would come home from the winery to see if someone was with his
wife.''

   Tamil rebels offered Saturday to hold
talks with the government on ending their war for independence, and
President Ranasinghe Premadasa responded by asking the group to
send their leaders to meet with him.
   The Tamil offer came hours after an ambush blamed on the rebels
left 21 soldiers dead. The attack brought to 79 the number of
people killed in three days of violence blamed on rebels.
   A spokesman for the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
largest and most powerful Tamil rebel group, said Saturday the
group sent a letter to Premadasa offering to hold talks.
   The last talks between the Tigers and the government were held
in 1985 in Thimpu, Bhutan. The negotiations ended in failure.
   Presidential press secretary Evans Cooray told The Associated
Press a message already has been sent to Anton Balasingham,
political leader of the Tamil Tigers, asking him to choose
representatives for the talks.
   Cooray said a message signed by Premadasa secretary K.H.A.
Wijayadasa was sent to Balasingham that read: ``Your message to
have a dialogue with the president of Sri Lanka is very much
appreciated.
   ``He has instructed me to request you to nominate accredited
representatives to discuss necessary arrangements to facilitate the
dialogue anywhere in Sri Lanka.''
   Also Sunday, a Tiger leader in Colombo said he met with
Premadasa at Anuradhapura, 103 miles north of Colombo and
personally conveyed the Tiger message to Premadasa.
   The leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Premadasa
was anxious to begin the talks.
   The movement toward talks comes after three days of heavy
bloodshed blamed on the rebels.
   Saturday's jungle ambush occurred near Parakramapura in Weli Oya
district, where soldiers were guarding Sinhalese laborers clearing
the forest, military officials in Colombo said.
   At least 21 soldiers were killed and four laborers were
critically injured in the fighting, the officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The village is about 150 miles northeast of Colombo.
   On Friday, at least 12 people were killed and 18 others injured
in the Tamil-dominated town of Jaffna, 180 miles north of Colombo,
when a car bomb exploded near the town's university.
   Military officials in Colombo said the bomb was intended for
soldiers in a small camp nearby and exploded prematurely.
   On Thursday, a car bomb in the port city of Trincomalee killed
45 people, mostly members of the Sinhalese ethnic majority.
   That explosion came a day after security forces began a weeklong
unilateral cease-fire in an effort to persuade both rebels of the
Tamil minority and militant members of the Sinhalese majority to
stop fighting.
   Both groups of radicals rejected the cease-fire proposal.
   Tamil separatists launched their bloody battle in 1983,
attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government's troops and Sinhalese
civilians. Government efforts to pacify the Tamil militants by
offering them a measure of autonomy in 1987 backfired.
   The Tigers rejected the overtures, and militant Sinhalese
embarked on their own campaign of assassinations against the
government, saying too many concessions were being offered the
Tamils.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, account
for 18 percent. Moslems comprise most other people on the island,
formerly known as Ceylon.
   India, the region's biggest military power, tried to help end
Sri Lanka's internal strife through a 1987 peace pact. Under the
pact, India dispatched peacekeeping troops, prompted by the
political sympathies of its own Tamil minority of 60 million.
   More than 12,500 people, including at least 800 Indian soldiers,
have died in the war.

   A 30-foot-tall, wooden bridge over railroad
tracks collapsed Saturday night, killing one person and seriously
injuring two others in the second bridge accident in Tennessee this
month.
   The collapse occurred as a pickup truck was trying to cross the
bridge, said Sgt. Thomas Mallory of the Tennessee Highway Patrol.
No other vehicles were on the bridge when it buckled, authorities
said.
   Vehicle and rail traffic was rerouted, said Gordon Disney, a
dispatcher for an ambulance service in nearby Clinton.
   A 25-foot section of the 75-foot-long bridge collapsed, he said.
Authorities did not say if the truck caused the collapse.
   The bridge is on a rural county road near Oliver Springs in
eastern Tennessee.
   The victim was identified as Wesley Gallaher, 16. Gallaher's
brothers, ages 14 and 16, were in serious condition Saturday night
at Oak Ridge's Methodist Medical Center, a hospital nursing
supervisor said.
   The state was ordered to re-evaluate its bridge inspection
program following the April 1 collapse of a bridge over the Hatchie
River near Memphis that sent eight people plunging to their deaths.

   Crowds surging against a steel
anti-riot fence in a packed soccer stadium crushed 94 fans to death
and injured at least 200 Saturday in Britain's worst sports
disaster, police said.
   Most of the dead, some of whom were trampled after the fence
collapsed, were teen-agers and children, ambulance official Michael
Boyce said.
   The crush appeared to be a result of overcrowding. Police said
they opened a gate to admit fans from outside, and witnesses said
hundreds of fans without tickets poured through a turnstile gate
behind one of the goals, crushing those at the front.
   ``We were like animals in a zoo,'' said 17-year-old Mark Meller.
``We were crushed against the wire-mesh barriers. I survived, I
don't know how.''
   ``It seemed as if it was four deep in dead bodies with people
climbing over them,'' said another survivor, 22-year-old Stuart
McGeagh.
   The death toll of 94 was the second-highest ever among crowds
watching soccer, the world's favorite spectator sport and one that
often sparks fatal accidents among its followers.
   South Yorkshire police Inspector Tom Walton said the death toll
rose by one overnight to 94 on Sunday. He said 17 seriously injured
people were in intensive care.
   The disaster on a sunny spring day added to the deadly image
that has attached itself in recent years to soccer in Britain,
which invented the game more than a century ago.
   The disaster occurred at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield, 150
miles north of London, in the opening minutes of the English F.A.
Cup semifinal between leading English league teams Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest.
   With the 54,000-capacity stadium already nearly full, police
opened the gate to admit about 4,000 last-minute arrivals, fearing
that otherwise there would be trouble outside, said South Yorkshire
Chief Constable Peter Wright.
   Inside the stadium, five minutes after kickoff, a surge of
people pushed hundreds of spectators against a steel mesh anti-riot
fence that soon collapsed.
   ``The purpose of opening the gate was to save people's lives and
to relieve the crush outside,'' Wright said. He said he was not
aware of any connection between the gates opening and the surge
inside.
   Police and soccer authorities immediately announced
investigations into the cause of the disaster.
   Wright said he believed the tickets of the last-minute arrivals
were checked, but fans said they weren't.
   A gateman who requested anonymity was quoted by Press
Association, the British news agency, as saying he saw the police
open the stadium gate.
   ``It was a free-for-all. There were thousands coming in. I said
to the police, `What are you doing that for?' and a policeman said,
`Someone is going to die if we don't.' It's my opinion that opening
those gates caused the tragedy.''
   The 10-foot-high fence has metal curved spikes facing the
standing-room section to stop people from climbing over, and a
stadium official said those who were pressed against it would have
been lucky to survive.
   For about 30 minutes, pressure mounted as people poured into the
section reserved for Liverpool fans.
   The barrier behind the goalposts collapsed minutes after the 3
p.m. kickoff and more spectators were trampled as the throng burst
onto the field.
   Many sprawled on the grass gasping for air. Police and first aid
workers pounded on the chests of suspected heart attack victims and
gave mouth-to-mouth respiration. Weeping parents and children
hunted for each other amid the carnage.
   A police officer ran onto the field and asked the referee to
halt the game. Play stopped at 3:06 p.m. and hours later soccer
officials postponed the match.
   For a while there was sporadic fighting between rival fans, news
reports said. Then, as the extent of the injuries became clear,
fans realized crowd violence was not responsible and stopped
brawling.
   BBC-TV carried the scenes of pandemonium nationwide, breaking
into regular programming.
   ``People were just crushing in. There was a lad and his
girlfriend and they were just screaming. His words were `please
God, help me,' and I believe the girl died. Her face was just
blue,'' an unidentified fan told Yorkshire Television.
   ``There was a gentleman on my arm and he said, `You're choking
me, you're choking me,' and he just fell, and that was the last of
him,'' said another youth, who was close to tears.
   Witness McGeagh said: ``Everything seemed to be all right until
about two minutes before the kickoff, when there was a big crush
forward.
   ``I was at the front and stuck up against the fence. There were
railings down either side. It was like being in a cage.
   ``I thought I was going to die. I was getting short of breath, I
couldn't breathe. The weight on me was tremendous.''
   Some spectators escaped by climbing up to an overhead balcony.
Others risked impaling themselves as they scrambled over the spiked
fence.
   Fans and rescue workers ripped up advertising boards and used
them as makeshift stretchers. Some of the first-aid attendants were
12-year-old volunteers who themselves needed treatment for shock.
   ``I am deeply sorry that the day has ended this way,'' said
English Football Association chief executive Graham Kelly. ``We had
six minutes of football and one-and-a-half hours of absolute
bedlam.''
   Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
expressed their shock.
   The death toll of 94 equaled that of an accident last March in
Katmandu, Nepal, when soccer fans stampeded trying to escape a
violent hailstorm.
   The worst loss of life at a soccer match came in May 1964 when
rioting at an Argentina-Peru match in Lima left nearly 300 dead.
   Fours years ago, 56 people died when fire swept a grandstand at
a soccer field in Bradford, England. That tragedy came just 18 days
before 39 people, most of them Italians, were crushed to death in
fighting between supporters of Liverpool and Juventus of Turin,
Italy, at the European Champions Cup final in Brussels, Belgium.
   The previous high death toll at a British sports event was 66
people killed in a crush of fans at a soccer match between Glasgow
rivals Rangers and Celtic in 1971.

<HEAD>Communist Rebels Offer Ceasefire If Aquino Closes Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist rebels said Sunday they
would declare a unilateral cease-fire and enter into peace talks if
President Corazon Aquino promises to close U.S. bases here by 1991.
   The offer was contained in a statement by the rebel National
Democratic Front, which was delivered to news organizations.
   In the statement, the group said the United States was using its
six military bases here to ``wage war and aggression'' in the
Pacific and ``to impose and maintain the prevailing system'' of
oppression in this former American colony.
   The United States maintains Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller installations under an agreement that expires
in 1991. Mrs. Aquino has refused to say whether she will support an
extension, which would require approval of two-thirds of the
23-member Senate.
   The rebel statement said if the government ends the agreement on
the bases ``the National Democratic Front would not hesitate to
immediately declare a unilateral ceasefire and enter into
negotiations for a comprehensive political settlement and a
peaceful end to the civil war.''
   The Front said that if Mrs. Aquino refused, it would call ``upon
the revolutionary Filipino people to themselves dismantle the
bases.''
   The Front is a confederation of 12 outlawed organizations,
including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its military
wing, the New People's Army. The rebels have been waging a 20-year
insurgency to establish a Marxist state.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventy-five years after the nation was
introduced to Form 1040, Americans are closing another
return-filing season with several million taxpayers apparently
putting off the chore until the Monday midnight deadline.
   The Internal Revenue Service promised that its walk-in offices
would remain open on the final day until every taxpayer with a
question was served. The Postal Service went out of its way to
receive returns and make sure they were postmarked before midnight.
   Taxpayers were given an extra two days to file because the April
15 deadline fell on Saturday. Residents of New England and most of
New York state have until Tuesday midnight because Monday is a
legal holiday, Patriot's Day, in Massachusetts, site of the IRS
service center that receives returns from those states.
   Neither the IRS nor the Postal Service had a firm estimate on
how many people delayed filing until the last day. The IRS said
only that it expects to receive about 18 million returns this week,
which would include those filed over the weekend. About 14 million
reached the IRS last week.
   The tax agency projects more than 109 million returns will be
filed this year _ but not all those will meet the deadline:
   _Around 6 million couples and individuals will take four-month
extensions, to Aug. 15, by filing Form 4868 along with a check for
the taxes they estimate they owe. The extension is only for filing
_ not for paying.
   _A sizable number of the 650,000 Americans living and working
abroad qualify for automatic two-month extensions without filing
any special form or paying estimated taxes.
   _Some taxpayers don't operate on a calendar year and, thus, have
different filing deadlines.
   _And some will simply miss the filing deadline, despite the fact
that such tardiness can bring a penalty for not filing on time _
even if there is no tax due _ and additional and more severe
penalties for not filing and paying on time if there is tax due.
   ``Of the 109 million-plus returns anticipated this year, we
expect about 100 million will file during the regular season,''
said IRS spokesman Frank Keith.
   Monday midnight also is the deadline for taxpayers to file
amended 1985 returns. That is an important point for up to 1.5
million people, mainly pensioners, who may have overpaid taxes for
that year because they failed to claim a credit for withheld taxes.
   The IRS has since changed a policy that barred employees from
pointing out such overpayments.
   When the first individual returns were filed in 1914, they
numbered only 358,000, identifying as taxpayers or dependents
considerably less than 1 percent of the population. The returns
covered taxes totaling $28 million, a figure so insignificant by
modern federal standards that it would show up as an asterisk in
budget documents.
   The returns being filed this year represent more than 90 percent
of the population and will reflect taxes of about $425 billion.
   The 1988 returns are the first filed under the three-tax-rate
structure that was enacted as the keystone of the 1986 tax
overhaul. Those three rates _ 15 percent for all the taxable income
of the majority of taxpayers, 28 percent for most others, and 33
percent for a relatively few _ represent one of the few significant
tax-law changes from last filing season.
   Nevertheless, an IRS sampling of early returns showed taxpayers
making the same mistakes that plagued last year's filings: writing
down the wrong tax liability figure from the tax tables; claiming
the wrong standard deduction; failing to check the box on Form
1040A or 1040EZ that indicates whether a person may be claimed as a
dependent by another, and mathematical errors.
   The IRS cautioned taxpayers to make sure returns are signed and
that the perjury oath above the signature is not altered. The
envelope in which a return is mailed must carry the correct postage
or the Postal Service will not accept it.
   Processing of a return and of any refund due is expedited if
taxpayers use the bar-coded envelopes and the peel-off labels that
were mailed out by the IRS.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Weapons Seized at Soviet Airports Last Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Security officials at Soviet airports last year
seized more than 250 guns and 900 pounds of explosives, a news
report said Sunday.
   Last summer, officials said there were at least 50 hijack
attempts in the Soviet Union over the past 15 years. However, the
weekly magazine Ogonyok, which published the new report, did not
say how many of the weapons seized in 1988 were linked to attempted
hijackings.
   The magazine claimed all Soviet hijack attempts were motivated
by a desire to leave the country or by personal greed. It said in
the West, people usually commandeer planes for political reasons.
   Several recent hijackings and attempted hijackings in the Soviet
Union have made international news.
   On March 30, a man demanding $855,000 and a flight to Pakistan
tried to hijack a Soviet airliner carrying 75 passengers to the
Caspian seaport of Baku. He was subdued and no one was injured.
   Authorities described that would-be hijacker as a fugitive from
the law.
   In December, four hijackers commandeered a Soviet school bus,
and officials provided them with an Ilyushin 76-T transport plane
that flew them to Israel. They were arrested there and sent back to
the Soviet Union, where they were given prison sentences ranging
from 13 to 15 years.
   The magazine said in its Sunday report that more than 250 guns,
900 pounds of explosives, and 86,177 knives and other weapons were
confiscated at Soviet airports last year.
   Ogonyok suggested that the best way to avoid hijackings was
simply to give a ticket to anyone who wants to leave the country.
   ``Why are we still stubbornly defending the rules that do not
permit the uneducated, idle people, drug addicts and criminals to
leave the country and go wherever they want?'' the magazine asked.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of opponents of U.S. forces in
Spain marched Sunday toward a U.S. base with a brass band and a
sign declaring ``NATO out, bases out.''
   Spain and the United States signed a new eight-year agreement in
December that requires withdrawal of 72 U.S. F-16 fighter bombers
by 1992. However, the pact allows continued U.S. use of three
military bases and nine communications posts.
   Italy has agreed to provide a new home for the planes at Crotone.
   Sunday's demonstrators walked seven miles from the Spanish
capital to Torrejon de Ardoz, site of a U.S. air base. They
demanded dismantling of that and other U.S. bases and protested the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The protest was organized by anti-NATO activists in Madrid, the
Spanish Communist Party, leftist labor unions, and pacifist groups.
They estimated the crowd at 25,000, but police said only 5,000
people took part.
   No incidents were reported. It was the ninth year in a row such
a demonstration has been held.
   The new accord on bases reduces the allowed number of U.S.
troops in Spain from 12,545 to 8,078.
   Spain became a NATO member in May 1982, but its military remains
outside the joint command of the Western alliance.

<TEXT>
   A powerful earthquake destroyed 30 homes in a
remote village in southwest China early Sunday, and an official
report said at least four people were killed and five injured.
   The exact number of casualties was not known because
communication with some towns in the area was broken, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
   The quake, which measured 6.7 on the Richter scale, struck at
5:34 a.m. near the town of Batang, which is close to Sichuan
province's western border with Tibet, the State Seismological
Bureau said.
   Over the next seven hours, more than 1,000 aftershocks were
recorded, five measuring above 4 on the scale, Xinhua quoted
provincial scientists as saying.
   The affected region of Sichuan is a densely populated rural
mountain region. Many of the residents are Tibetans. Population
figures were not immediately available.
   Xinhua said about 30 houses collapsed in Sangdagou village in
Zhubalong township, the epicenter of the quake. It said cracks
appeared in 80 percent of the houses in nearby Batang.
   A bridge on the Jinsha River, which passes through Batang, was
damaged along with water conservation and power facilities, Xinhua
said.
   Premier Li Peng, who returned to Beijing on Sunday after a
five-day visit to Japan, immediately was briefed on the earthquake
and sent Sichuan officials a message of sympathy, Xinhua said. It
said he urged them to take steps to minimize possible losses from
aftershocks and restore life to normal.
   Xinhua said rescue teams were en route to the epicenter.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 6 or higher can cause severe damage
in a populated area.
   An earthquake measuring 7.6 killed 730 people and injured about
4,000 in November in Yunnan province, south of Sichuan. It was
China's worst earthquake since the 1976 temblor that leveled most
of the northeastern city of Tangshan.

   Communist rebels said Sunday they
would declare a cease-fire in their 20-year insurgency and hold
peace talks if President Corazon Aquino vows to close U.S. military
bases in the Philippines by 1991.
   The rebel National Democratic Front made the proposal in a
statement delivered to news organizations.
   The statement said if the Aquino government closed the bases by
1991 and promised no further agreements for U.S. bases, ``the
National Democratic Front would not hesitate to immediately declare
a unilateral cease-fire and enter into negotiations for a
comprehensive political settlement and a peaceful end to the civil
war.''
   The Front accused the United States of using its six military
installations in the Philippines to ``wage war and aggression'' in
the Pacific and said the bases were ``a major stumbling block to
peace'' in this former American colony.
   The United States maintains Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval
Base, two of its largest facilities overseas, and four smaller
installations in the Philippines.
   More than 60,000 Filipinos are employed at the bases, where
about 40,000 U.S. troops and their dependents are stationed.
   The lease on the U.S. installations expires in 1991. Under the
Philippines constitution, military bases of foreign countries would
be banned after that, unless two-thirds of the 23-member Senate
approved a treaty allowing them. Opposition to such facilities is
strong in the Senate.
   Mrs. Aquino refuses to say if she will support extending the
lease.
   The United States has been pushing for early talks on a new
bases treaty but no date has been set. Opponents see the bases as
an infringement of Philippine sovereignty and a vestige of American
colonial rule.
   In October, the United States and the Philippines signed an
agreement allowing the bases to remain until 1991 in return for
more than $960 million in American economic and military aid over
two years.
   The Front is a confederation of 12 underground organizations
including the Communist Party of the Philippines and its armed
wing, the New People's Army. The removal of U.S. bases is one of
the rallying points of their insurgency, which began in 1969.
   The Aquino government entered into peace talks with the rebels
in December 1986 but negotiations collapsed the following month.

fighting to at least 226 killed and 827 wounded.

<HEAD>Case Draws Attention to Wisconsin Grandparent Liability Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYANN MROWCA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state law that forces grandparents to
support the children of their sexually active young teen-agers
should not have been applied in the case of a 12-year-old who
fathered a child by a 19-year-old woman, the boy's angry father
says.
   The man, a dairy farmer who is under court order to submit
financial information on his ability to pay support, says the law
is unfair and that the woman should have been held responsible. His
complaints have added fuel to debate over the law, which could be
allowed to expire this year.
   Even a former prosecutor who decided not to press charges
against the woman, because she is slightly retarded, said that now
that she is a legislator she will support changes in the statute.
The decision by prosecutors not to pursue the case prevented the
boy's family from being exempted from the support requirement.
   Wisconsin was one of the first states to pass such a law holding
parents financially responsible for children born to their
children. Since then, several other state have considered the issue
and a few have passed similar laws, said Rep. Marlin Schneider,
chief sponsor of the measure.
   The law is due to expire Dec. 31 under a ``sunset'' provision.
Schneider said he will continue to support it ``until we have
something better,'' but said it might need some refinement in light
of cases like that of the boy.
   ``No one ever thought of the bizarre circumstances like this,''
he said.
   Figures cited by Schneider show that as of last October, 13
grandparents or sets of grandparents across the state had been
ordered to pay support. The average support was $80 per month.
   Last week, a Winnebago County judge ordered the dairy farmer to
submit financial information within 30 days for the court to decide
whether he must pay child support.
   The farmer, who spoke on the condition his name not be used,
said he believes Wisconsin's grandparent liability law is unfair in
his son's case because of the age of the woman.
   ``She was an adult. She should have known better,'' said the
grandfather. His son, now 15, has no contact with the child, born
in August 1987, he said.
   If the woman had been convicted of first-degree sexual assault,
the boy's parents would have become exempt from the child-support
liability, but the case was never prosecuted.
   State Rep. Peg Lautenschlager, who was then a district attorney,
decided against prosecuting the woman. She said she believes she
made the correct decision because the woman was mildly retarded and
functioned at a level significantly lower than her physical age.
The woman was required to receive counseling, she said.
   ``It was a most inappropriate case for prosecution,'' said Ms.
Lautenschlager.
   Milton Schierland, the Winnebago County assistant corporation
counsel who has pursued the case to try to obtain child support
payments on behalf of the state, said he has the baby's best
interests at heart.
   ``We're not bullying a poor set of grandparents,'' he said.
   ``On the surface, I would say this sounds terrible. This sounds
like something the legislation was not designed to do,'' Schierland
said.
   But he said he believed if people knew the underlying facts of
the case, which county officials cannot discuss because the boy is
a minor, ``they would not feel that way at all.''
   Robert Swain, an attorney for the boy's parents, argues that the
boy was not a teen-ager and the grandparent liability law is
directed at the conduct of teen-agers.
   ``Secondly, he is under the age of consent for having sexual
relations,'' Swain said. ``Thirdly, she is an adult. She's the one
who is supposed to be exercising responsibility for her conduct.''
   The case has drawn the attention of the Wisconsin Civil
Liberties Union, which has opposed the grandparent liability law
since it was passed in 1985 as part of a broader Wisconsin act
aimed at preventing teen-age pregnancies.
   Ms. Lautenschlager said she believes the law is based on a
``faulty premise'' that holding the parents of a child who has a
child financially responsible would reduce promiscuity.
   Schneider said the law was never intended to punish anyone but
was meant to urge parents to discuss sexual matters with their
children.

   The searing question of apartheid has split many
families in South Africa, reaching up to the highest social and
political levels. Here is a report on the phenomenon.

<TEXT>
   Like many Afrikaner families,
the de Klerk brothers disagree sharply on politics.
   What makes their dispute unique is that F.W. de Klerk is
expected to be the next president of South Africa, and his brother
helps lead the anti-apartheid opposition.
   F.W. is head of the governing National Party and is the odds-on
favorite to succeed President P.W. Botha after elections to be held
by September.
   Willem de Klerk is chief policy adviser to the new Democratic
Party, which seeks to end the Nationalists' policy of apartheid and
give voting rights to the black majority.
   The deep political rift between them is notable because of de
Klerks' prominence, but it is not uncommon. Among South Africa's 3
million Afrikaners, families are increasingly split by differences
over apartheid, the multifaceted system of racial segregation and
discrimination that protects white power and privileges.
   There are the Breytenbach brothers _ Breyten, an exiled poet
once jailed for aiding black nationalist guerrillas, and Jan, an
army general.
   There is Gen. Constand Viljoen, former commander in chief of the
military, and his twin brother Abram, a theologian who ran
unsucessfully for Parliament on an anti-apartheid platform.
   There is Klaus von Lieres, the attorney general for the
Johannnesburg region, and his niece, Bettina von Lieres, president
of the militantly anti-apartheid student council at the University
of the Witwatersrand.
   Her uncle has coordinated the prosecution of scores of
anti-apartheid activists in treason and terrorism cases.
   Willem de Klerk, 60, says he maintains a close, relaxed
relationship with his younger brother, even though they argue over
politics.
   ``I try to influence him, and he tries very hard to convert me
again to the National Party platform,'' said Willem, who resigned
as editor of the country's major Afrikaans-language Sunday
newspaper, Rapport, in 1987 after Botha complained to the
publishers about editorials that questioned government policy.
   ``There is a lot of pressure on me from National Party people
who say I am an embarrassment to my brother,'' Willem said in an
interview. ``But this doesn't bother me. I am very firm on this one
point _ as long as the National Party retains race groups as the
cornerstone for a future constitution, I reject that.''
   The de Klerks come from a prominent Nationalist family. Their
great-grandfather was a senator, and their father was a Cabinet
minister.
   Willem said he began to diverge from National Party thinking in
1973, when he became a newspaper editor. He emerged as a spokesman
for the relatively liberal wing of the party while his brother
supported the harsh racial segregation policies formulated by Prime
Minister Hendrick Verwoerd in the 1950s and '60s.
   At one point, Willem wrote that South Africa could not and
should not be divided into black and white, an assertion he says
was ``almost blasphemy at the time.''
   His brother, 53, also has evolved politically, Willem said.
   ``He's not so conservative and apartheid-oriented as he was.
Maybe he will develop into a more enlightened politician, moving
away from apartheid. But I don't think he will turn the corner. He
may be a transitional figure.''
   In his one major speech since becoming National Party leader in
February, F.W. de Klerk sought to please both conservatives and
reformers.
   `Our strong emphasis on group rights ... is based on the reality
of South Africa and not on an ideological obsession with racial
prejudice,'' he said. ``There is no such thing as a non-racial
society in a multiracial country.''
   Willem disagrees.
   ``For white people, their only hope for survival is to go into
the world of non-racialism,'' he said. ``The National Party wants
to entrench racial concepts.''
   The Democratic Party _ established April 8 through a merger of
three white liberal parties _ has no illusions about taking power
in the upcoming elections. But Willem predicted the National Party
will fare well in the elections under his brother's leadership.
   ``Forgetting that it's my brother, I think voters will feel they
should give the new man a chance,'' Willem said. ``He's a man with
a different style (than Botha), more relaxed, more pragmatic.''
   Despite his break with the National Party, Willem de Klerk
remains very much a member of the Afrikaner establishment.
   By contrast, Breyten Breytenbach lives in exile in Paris and has
renounced his South African citizenship. He has returned to South
Africa only once since he was freed in 1982 after seven years in
prison on a terrorism conviction for aiding the outlawed African
National Congress.
   During the return visit in 1986, Breytenbach was awarded an
Afrikaans-language literature prize. He minced no words during an
acceptance speech to a mainly Afrikaner audience.
   ``I doubt you realize the extent to which we have become
despicable to the international human awareness,'' he said. ``Our
rottenness is unique.''
   Breytenbach has said he and his brother in the army, Jan, viewed
each other as dangerous enemies but nonetheless still loved each
other.
   In the case of the Viljoen twins, it was the conservative,
Constand, who broke away from the family's relatively liberal
views, according to his brother, Abram.
   ``We both started careers in the army in 1952,'' said Abram.
``After one year, I went to university to study theology, and he
stayed in the army. ... Our ways parted rather severely as far as
political thinking goes.''
   Bettina von Lieres, 24, says her relationship with her uncle is
``cordial but distant.''
   Being the niece of the attorney general has not hampered her
involvement in student politics, she said. ``I've built up my
credentials as an anti-apartheid student council representative. If
anything, there's a lot of curiosity about me, and in some ways the
curiosity has developed into respect.''

<HEAD>Bridge Collapse Kills One, Two Weeks After Eight-Fatality Span Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Department of Transportation
knew of structural problems with a highway bridge well in advance
of the span's collapse in which eight people were killed earlier
this month, records show.
   A second bridge collapse, meanwhile, killed one teen-ager and
injured two others riding with him Saturday night. The pickup
landed upside down on railroad tracks 25 feet below the 40-year-old
wooden bridge near the eastern Tennessee town of Oliver Springs,
according to Trooper Ray Fletcher.
   It was not immediately clear whether the 25-foot section of the
bridge had already collapsed or it crumbled as the truck drove over
it, police said.
   The accident killed Ronald W. Gallaher, 16, of Oliver Springs.
His brother, Derwin, 14, was in stable condition Sunday at the
University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. Timothy E.
Seiber, 16, of Oliver Springs was in serious condition at Methodist
Medical Center in Oak Ridge.
   Saturday's collapse in eastern Tennessee came exactly two weeks
after the failure of the Hatchie River bridge, 45 miles north of
Memphis in the western part of the state. Eight people died when
the U.S. 51 span gave way, plunging their cars into the flooded
river.
   That accident was thought to have been caused by high water
washing out or ``scouring'' soil away from bridge supports.
Tennessee Department of Transportation records show the
deficiencies were discovered during inspections in 1985 and 1987.
   But bridge inspection reports at the agency's office in
Nashville showed no indication that recommended repairs were made.
   Maintenance reports kept at the department's regional office in
Jackson, Tenn., have been turned over to state Attorney General
Larry Teague, said William Moore Jr., civil engineering director in
Jackson. He declined to comment on the records Friday.
   ``As far as I know, no major maintenance has been done on that
bridge in the last several years,'' he told a Memphis newspaper,
The Commercial Appeal.
   The transportation department will hire an Illinois engineering
company to investigate the Hatchie River collapse, Moore said.
   Inspections in July 1985 and September 1987 showed evidence of
scouring at the Hatchie River bridge and recommended that steps be
taken to protect four bridge supports.
   Those inspection reports should have been warnings of potential
future problems, said P.K. Basu, a civil engineer and professor at
Vanderbilt University's School of Engineering.
   ``If scouring is happening, that's a danger signal right
there,'' Basu said. ``Right away, they should have inspected under
the water. They should have looked at it and fixed it right then.''
   In a news conference after the Hatchie River accident, Tennessee
Transportation Commissioner Jimmy Evans said that after the 1987
inspection, ``We saw nothing that unduly concerned members of the
bridge inspection division.''
   He said the span was visually inspected in February because of
river flooding, but ``we did not see anything that would unduly
concern us about any movements of the bridge at all.''
   Basu said such a visual inspection ``is worthless.''

<HEAD>Jury Awards $9.5 Million In Abortion Case</HEAD>

   A jury awarded $9.5 million to a woman who was
left severely brain damaged after undergoing an abortion at
Illinois Masonic Medical Center.
   Shelby Moran, 50, who now lives in a suburban nursing home,
underwent the abortion in January 1978.
   The mother of five and former manager of the Oak Lawn Elks Club
suffered brain damage as a result of a reaction to a drug used in
the abortion, the Cook County jury decided Friday. The drug caused
her heart to stop, which cut off oxygen to her brain, her attorney
said.
   The court assessed the damages among the hospital; Dr. John J.
Barton, chief of obstetrics and gynecology; and Upjohn Co., maker
of the drug.
   She was given the drug while about four months' pregnant after
an unsuccessful tubal ligation.

<HEAD>Orthodox Jewish Children Collect Rabbi Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They're more than twice the size of baseball
cards, come four to a pack and show faces considerably older than
the average sports hero. But even without bubble gum, rabbi cards
are the rage among Orthodox Jewish youngsters.
   ``I used to collect baseball cards,'' said Meyer Brull, 12. ``I
gave them up after a while. I gave them to my brother. These are
more interesting.''
   His brother, Yossi, 10, agreed.
   ``They're something different from baseball cards. My teacher
used to give out pictures if you were good in class. So I got a lot
that way.''
   Like their counterparts in the baseball world, rabbi cards are
collected by youngsters _ and some adults _ who buy them by the
pack and trade to get pictures of all 36 of the Orthodox religious
leaders featured thus far.
   The card back includes the rabbi's place and date of birth,
schooling and other facts in both English and Hebrew.
   In Judaism, rabbis are teachers as well as spiritual leaders,
and in closely knit Orthodox communities they are usually revered
role models.
   The cards, produced by Torah Publications, are the brainchild of
Arthur B. Shugarman. More than 300,000 cards from the first series
have been sold since their introduction last August, and a second
series will be out in about a week, said Shugarman, 34, an
accountant who lives in Baltimore and works in suburban Towson.
   Torah Publications is non-profit, and any money it makes
probably will be used to lower costs for the next series of cards,
Shugarman said.
   ``It's for the children,'' said Shugarman, the father of two
young daughters. ``It's educational.''
   Shugarman said the next five-card pack is expected to sell for
99 cents. The current four-card packs cost 79 cents in most
locations. They are sold at religious goods stores throughout the
United States and in Canada and some European countries, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hispanic and black women, women with low
incomes, those living with someone they are not married to, and
those in school are statistically more likely to undergo abortions
than women in general, according to a private survey.
   Firm statistics are not available on the number of abortions
performed each year nor on who has them. Moreover, the survey by
The Alan Guttmacher Institute confirms that most abortions are
performed on white, middle-class women because they make up the
bulk of the population of women of childbearing age.
   However, the extensive survey by the New York-based, non-profit
group that studies reproductive issues suggests that women in
various categories have a statistically disproportionate share of
abortions relative to their raw numbers.
   For example, it found that nonwhite women make up 16.7 percent
of the childbearing-age population, but accounted for 31.4 percent
of the abortions.
   White women accounted for 68.6 percent of those seeking
abortions, but 83.3 percent of the childbearing-age population,
considered 15-to-44 for purposes of the survey.
   And it found that women with family incomes below $11,000
accounted for 33.1 percent of those receiving abortions although
they made up only 29.2 percent of all women of childbearing age.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimates
there were 1,328,000 abortions in the United States in 1985, the
most recent year for which it has numbers. The Guttmacher Institute
estimates 1,588,550 that year.
   No one questions that the number has increased since the Supreme
Court legalized abortion in 1973. The court is hearing arguments
April 26 in a Missouri case that both sides agree could result in
the reversal, or weakening of that landmark Roe vs. Wade decision.
   The Guttmacher Institute surveyed 9,480 women who obtained
abortions at hospitals, clinics or doctors offices during 1987 in
an effort to find out who was obtaining the services.
   It selected 103 facilities in what was intended as a
statistically valid national sample base _ 21 hospitals and 82
clinics and physicians' offices _ and arranged for questionnaires
to be given to the 11,313 women who showed up for abortions during
a 12-day period.
   Although filling out and mailing in the questionnaire was
voluntary and done anonymously and privately by the woman, a large
number _ 9,480 _ returned completed questionnaires.
   Although no specific margin of error was given, the large sample
base lends credibility to the statistical profile of U.S. women
seeking abortions during that particular period in 1987.
   Unmarried women living with a man constituted 17.4 percent of
the abortion clients although they made up only 3.4 of all
childbearing-age women.
   Women attending school constituted 31.1 percent of those seeking
abortions, but 20.5 percent of all women of childbearing age.
   Most women cited more than one factor in their decision to have
an abortion. Among the reasons were concerns about how motherhood
would change their lives, financial problems, single parenthood,
the responsibility of parenthood, others knowing they were
pregnant, maturity and how many children they already had.

<HEAD>Former Philippine First Lady Says Problems Mount But She'll Persevere</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos, faced with the prospect of
standing trial alone on racketeering charges, describes her life
these days as a ``comic tragedy.'' But she remains optimistic that
``someone will decide what's right and we will go home.''
   In some respects, the former Philippines first lady's problems
would rival the plot of any soap opera: her husband is serious ill;
her children are scattered across the world; her assets are frozen;
loyal employees face deportation; her mother-in-law lies unburied
for nearly a year; she cannot go home.
   ``The problems just overlap, one after another,'' Mrs. Marcos
said in a recent interview. ``But now, Ferdinand is alive. I am not
in jail. So, there is hope.
   She said her and her husband's case ``has become such a
humongous monster that nobody wants to touch it with a 10-foot
pole. But I think someone will decide what's right and we will go
home.''
   Mrs. Marcos said that those who might accuse her of creating her
own problems do not understand her cultural background, her husband
or the country he ruled for 20 years.
   ``I grew up around everything American, American food, American
music ... USA, red, white and blue. The way I learned the song it
was `God Bless the Philippines.' We were your only colony,'' she
said. U.S. rule, which began during the Spanish-American War of
1898, continued until 1946.
   ``We were not just your friends, your allies, we were one in
spirit with America,'' she said. ``To give us justice now is to
show that your system is working throughout the whole world.''
   She disagrees vehemently with the U.S. government's version of
the Marcoses' exile to Hawaii in 1986 and the subsequent charges of
stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine government and
stashing it in the United States.
   Philippine President Corazon Aquino claims they stole billions
from the country's treasury and has banned their return, although
neither Ferdinand nor Imelda has been charged with fraud in their
homeland.
   Marcos, who has been in a hospital since Jan. 15 but recently
was removed from the intensive care unit, has been found by a
doctor to be unable to travel to New York to appear in court.
   A court conference on the case is scheduled for Monday, when a
trial date might be set for Mrs. Marcos. The 59-year-old former
beauty queen says she is certain she'll be vindicated and doesn't
expect to stand trial until after her husband either dies or
recovers.
   ``My duty is to him, that I am by his side when he needs me,''
she said. ``I really believe I'm here because of Marcos. I just
came in for the ride, the marriage ride.''
   Although she says she's no longer upset by critical media
coverage, Mrs. Marcos said she was amazed by those who say she
lives extravagantly.
   Her hillside home overlooks Honolulu and the Pacific Ocean and
she travels in a black limousine. But she also frequents discount
stores and says she often eats Chinese takeout food.
   ``The people below the hill may think it's a mansion, but I came
from a palace,'' she said. ``It's a step down for me. It's a lot
less.''
   Mrs. Marcos said her dream is that her husband will recover, her
family will be reunited, they will all return to the Philippines,
where Marcos' mother, who died last May, ``can finally be laid to
rest.''
   Although her daughter, Irene, and son, Ferdinand Jr., are free
to travel in the United States, another daughter, Imee, is exiled
in Morocco because she refused to testify before a grand jury
investigating her parents.

   A man gathering bamboo shoots stumbled onto a bag
with $758,000 in cash Sunday in the same thicket where a similar
find was made five days earlier, authorities said.
   Officials still aren't sure how the two bags with identical
amounts of cash ended up in the bamboo thicket 35 feet off a road
in Kawasaki southwest of Tokyo. Police suggested earlier that the
first bag may have come from a crime.
   The second bag turned up about 100 feet from where a restaurant
owner discovered the first one Tuesday, police said.
   Authorities did not identify the man who found the second bag
Sunday. He made the find as he and about 20 other people, including
three family members, looked for bamboo shoots to eat at home,
police said.
   The first bag, made of vinyl, carried damp and rotting bills.
Some of the cash, all in 10,000-yen notes equal to about $76 each,
was bundled with bank tape dated from 1985 to 1986.
   Seie Sato, 39, found the first bag while looking for bamboo
shoots for use at his restaurant and home. Under Japanese law, he
can keep the money if it is not claimed within six months.
   However, Sato told The Associated Press he hopes the owner of
the cash will soon report to police. So many reporters have called
to interview him, Sato said, he hasn't been able to work in his
restaurant.

<HEAD>Cottams Plead Innocent In Son's Starving</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ A couple have pleaded innocent to
third-degree murder charges in the starvation of their teen-age
son, who died after the family refused to buy food with money set
aside for a church tithe.
   Leona and Larry Cottam are charged in the Jan. 3 death of their
son, Eric, 14. They and their daughter, Laura, 12, were
hospitalized for treatment of malnutrition. Laura has since been
placed in a foster home.
   The couple, who have been jailed, unable to make bail, since
their arrest in January, entered their innocent pleas at a hearing
Friday.
   According to police, the Cottam family went largely without food
for six weeks, refusing to spend the only money they had _ more
than $3,500 set aside as a religious tithe.
   The family has been estranged from the Seventh-day Adventists
church since Cottam, 39, was dismissed as a minister because he and
his 38-year-old wife refused to send their two children to
church-run schools.
   Eric and Laura were schooled at home after their parents won a
two-year court battle.
   Officials of the Seventh-day Adventist Church say the religion
does not advocate fasting, holding a tithe instead of buying food
or turning down offers of help.
   One of the Cottams' attorneys, public defender Al Flora Jr.,
said he would seek to have the trial moved to another county or
have jurors picked from another county because of the wide
publicity given the case.
   Attorneys for the couple have argued in pretrial hearings that
the Cottams should not have been charged in their son's death
because he chose not to eat out of his own religious convictions.
   The Cottams must be tried before July 4 or they would be
released on $1 bail under state court rules. Both are jailed in
lieu of $50,000 bail.
   They face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison if convicted
of third-degree murder.

<HEAD>Washington Faces Growing NATO Tensions Over Upgrading Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   When Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
meets for the first time with NATO allies this week he will have to
grapple with Europe's growing unease over plans to upgrade
short-range nuclear weapons.
   Cheney, who took over as defense chief just a month ago, begins
talks Wednesday with other defense ministers of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization to review their nuclear posture.
   The two-day meeting of NATO's Nuclear Planning Group will focus
new attention on modernizing battlefield nuclear arms, a
potentially divisive issue for the allies at a time of warmer ties
with the Soviet Union.
   Diplomats said no key decisions were expected at the talks,
although the United States would like the allies to signal their
strong commitment to a modernization program.
   Germany, Belgium and some other European nations want to
postpone for several years the politically sensitive decisions of
production and deployment of a new generation of short-range,
surface-to-surface missiles.
   Those countries also would like the alliance to show a
willingness to negotiate reductions in those weapons with the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, a position the United States opposes.
Warsaw Pact foreign ministers recently made a new pitch for early
arms talks on those weapons.
   Cheney has indicated flexibility on the modernization issue.
   ``I think the timing is open to question,'' he recently told
reporters. ``I don't think it has to be done immediately.''
   He said, however, that the United States wants the allies at a
May 29-30 summit of NATO leaders to ``adopt a clear-cut position
that indicates that we, in fact, are going to maintain the
high-quality nuclear forces in Europe.''
   He said in a later interview that the United States opposes
East-West negotiations on those arms. ``We do not believe at this
point it would be appropriate to embark on yet another round of
arms control talks that would result in eliminating those
short-range forces,'' he said.
   ``The Soviets have always tried to de-nuclearize Europe, that's
been a major objective of theirs,'' he said. ``We've always
resisted it.''
   At the heart of the modernization debate is a plan, pressed by
the United States and Britain, to upgrade the Lance
surface-to-surface missile. Military analysts say the Lance,
introduced in 1972, will become obsolete in 1995.
   The missile has a range of a little more 60 miles. The new one
would travel more than 250 miles, just under the limits of the
Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces treaty. The accord eliminates
U.S. and Soviet land-based missiles with ranges of about 300 to
3,400 miles.
   U.S. Gen. John Galvin, NATO's top military commander in Europe,
has drafted a report for NATO officials arguing that replacing the
aging Lance will enable the West to make sharp cuts in nuclear
artillery.
   The United States wants a commitment from the allies before it
urges Congress to approve money to produce the new missile.
Congress is to consider this year a request for funds to develop a
model for test purposes. But resistance in Germany, where most of
the weapons would be based, has raised questions about what kind of
signal the United States will get this spring.
   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl says he wants to delay a decision
on production of the new missile until 1991 or 1992 _ after
important elections next year in Germany.
   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``We're not to a point in the development where the alliance needs
or it is even possible to make production or deployment
decisions.'' The alliance, he said, never planned to make those key
decisions before 1991 or 1992.
   A European diplomat, who also demanded anonymity, said some NATO
nations worry the modernization program would amount to development
of a new category of nuclear arms, with a vastly longer range.
   They are concerned, he said, that such a development would
create the impression the allies are trying to get around the
accord eliminating medium-range nuclear arms. ``We want to see a
situation where reliance on nuclear weapons is decreasing,'' he
said.
   The West contends it maintains a nuclear arsenal as a deterrent,
countering the huge superiority the East has built up in
conventional weapons.

<HEAD>Tanks A Lot: Motorists Can Face Fines For Buying Bargain Gas Across
Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SINGAPORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning Monday, motorists leaving this island
republic with less than half a tank of gas will be breaking the law
and could end up paying a fine of nearly $260.
   The so-called ``half-tank law,'' enacted by Parliament earlier
this month, is designed to stop people from crossing into
neighboring Malaysia to buy gas that is 20 percent cheaper. Premium
gas costs 48 cents a liter in Singapore.
   The bargain-hunting motorists were costing the government more
than $1 million a month in excise taxes, officials claimed.
   A single road across a causeway connects Singapore with the
southern tip of the Malay Peninsula. Signs near the immigration
post portray the fuel gauge of a car and warn, ``Singapore cars
please top up.''
   Disconnecting your fuel guage won't work. A fine of about $2,580
or three months in jail faces Singapore motorists with non-working
fuel gauges.
   ``Customs officers will walk around cars and check fuel gauges
at random while they are clearing immigration formalities,'' said
Lee Yew Kim, director-general of the Customs and Excise Department.
   ``We will do our jobs unobtrusively. Motorists will not even
have to wind down their windows,'' he said.
   Finance Minister Richard Hu said about 6,000
Singapore-registered cars cross into Malaysia daily.
   Opposition member Lee Siew Choh said the measure is
``irrational, schizophrenic and illogical,'' a protectionist move
that could damage relations with Malaysia.
   Malaysian newspapers reported that gas station owners in Johor
Baru, across the causeway from Singapore, could lose more than
$370,000 weekly in gas sales to cars from Singapore.

   Two bulls jumped a fence and did the old
Casanova love-'em-and-leave-'em routine with a herd of heifers, a
lawsuit going to trial in Iowa County Circuit Court this week
claims.
   A jury will consider the $73,000 lawsuit filed by Michael and
Paul Mieden of Barneveld, who claim two of their neighbor's bulls
jumped a fence and impregnated 32 Meiden heifers during the summer
of 1986.
   The Miedens' suit alleges that neighbor Lloyd Vivian was
negligent because of his ``failure to properly maintain and repair
a fence on the boundary line'' between the two properties.
   The Miedens claim many of the impregnated heifers were so young
that their careers as milk producers were diminished by their early
pregnancies. A heifer is a young cow that has not yet had a calf.
   Colleen Martin, an appraiser hired by the Miedens, said in court
documents that the heifers were bred when they were ``too small to
produce milk efficiently.''
   As a result, the animals ``will never reach full potential in
size and production due to this crisis,'' Ms. Martin said.
   The case was set for a Nov. 28 jury trial, but it was delayed
after one expert witness was taken ill and hospitalized. The trial
was rescheduled for Monday and is expected to last about a week,
said Iowa County Clerk of Courts Carolyn Olson.

   Jim Anderson and Tammy Gottas had become so
accustomed to riding a city bus together that they needed one to
get from the church to their wedding reception.
   ``We met on the bus, we talked on the bus, we pretty much dated
on the bus,'' Anderson said.
   And to honor the central place the city bus system had taken in
their life together, the couple, the wedding party and some of the
guests trooped from the church to a bus stop and caught a
Metropolitan Transit Commission bus to the wedding reception
Saturday.
   Anderson, a 34-year-old computer graphics technician, and
Gottas, a 31-year-old customer service representative, didn't
ordinarily take the same bus from suburban Bloomington to downtown
Minneapolis.
   But after they met last year when Anderson was going to work a
bit later than usual, he started making a point of taking that
later bus. They eventually started dating, and began taking the
same evening bus back to Bloomington as well.
   Then, one evening, Anderson decided to surprise her.
   ``I knew 35W was going to be backed up as usual, bumper to
bumper. I waited until it got really backed up. So I got on my
knees. I am saying, `I love you, do you want to marry me?' and she
is grabbing me, pulling me up,'' he said.
   The bus riders applauded.
   ``I can see a series in this,'' Anderson said. ``Love Bus.''

<UNK>Judge Rules KKK Cross-Burning Violated Burning Ordinance</UNK>
<DATELINE>JIM THORPE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has upheld the conviction of a Ku
Klux Klan backer of violating a township fire-control ordinance by
allowing a cross to burn on his property, saying that a Klan
cross-burning was not a religious ceremony.
   ``Were we to conclude, on this record, that KKK is a religion
under the First Amendment, we would have to so qualify every group
who came into court with a Bible, a lighted match and a claim to be
a Christian,'' Carbon County Judge John P. Lavelle said in his
ruling last week.
   According to the court, Joseph A. Lower Jr. and his wife leased
their property for $1 to the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan for a July 4 rally last summer.
   Before the rally, township Police Chief Richard Gross informed
Lower that an ordinance prohibited fires after dark.
   However, 36 white-sheeted KKK members gathered on Lower's
property for a rally including speeches and marches, and ignited a
large wooden cross, which burned for about half an hour, Lavelle
said.
   District Justice Bruce Appleton of Palmerton convicted Lower on
Aug. 1 and ordered him to pay $325 for a fine and court costs.
Lower appealed to Lavelle.
   Lower admitted he violated the burning ordinance, but tried to
get the citation dismissed by arguing the ceremony was religious in
nature.
   At an appeal hearing Feb. 16, Mark W. Thomas, a state chaplain
with the KKK chapter in Reading, testified the cross-burning
ceremony was a necessary and integral part of the religious rituals
of the Klan. He said the KKK had no ordained ministers but that
everyone was ordained by God to speak the word of God.
   The judge ruled the KKK was not a religion under federal court
rulings. He also found that Lower was not a victim of selective
prosecution by the township because of his membership with the KKK.

<TEXT>
   Administration and congressional leaders
defended themselves Sunday against charges that their deal to cut
the 1990 budget deficit to $99.4 billion was unrealistic and based
on accounting gimmicks.
   ``This was the best that could be done,'' said the chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee, Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn.
   The White House chief of staff, John Sununu, said the agreement
achieved ``a very significant reduction of the deficit.''
   The most prominent critic has been the chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, who refused to
attend the White House ceremony last Friday announcing the deal.
   Bentsen questioned a provision in the agreement which forecast
an additional $5.3 billion in revenues. The source of that money
has not been negotiated, and President Bush has refused to boost
taxes to cut the deficit.
   Critics of the agreement were angered, said Sununu, because
``there is not a big tax package in there.''
   The extra $5.3 billion, he said, would ``come almost entirely
from the increased revenue that comes when you reduce the capital
gains tax, $4.8 billion, a proposal that I think in the past
Senator Bentsen has been in favor of.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and Sununu said the
administration would not agree to raise revenue next year by
increasing the federal tax on gasoline, but they refused to discuss
whether such a tax as possible for 1991.
   Administration and congressional leaders described the agreement
as an 8-year highwater mark in budget cooperation between Democrats
and Republicans.
   ``I think that what this bipartisanship means is that we put
behind us eight years of confrontation and gridlock that occurred
with the Reagan administration and produced absolutely monumental
peacetime deficits for this agreement,'' said Sasser. ``It sets the
stage for some significant budget reductions'' in 1991 and beyond.
   The chairman of the House Budget Committee, Rep. Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., said: ``The alternative to not working together, frankly,
is chaos. Congress would not be able to put together a budget
resolution, and Congress is not going to do anything about tax
increases without the support of the president. That limited our
choices.''
   Panetta described the agreement as a ``first step. There isn't
anybody, either from the White House or from Capitol Hill, that
doesn't believe more has to be done.''
   Panetta predicted that the budget deficit would fall below the
ceiling of $100 billion set by the Gramm-Rudman law, but Sasser
said, ``I think the deficit will be above $99 billion,'' possibly
as high as $110 billion.
   Sasser called the deal ``a minimalist agreement. I would like to
have done much more.''
   Sasser appeared on the ABC-TV interview program, ``This Week
with David Brinkley,'' Sununu and Panetta on CBS-TV's ``Face the
Nation,'' Brady on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.''

<HEAD>Thousands March To Honor Massacre Victims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Solidarity supporters marched
in this Baltic port city Sunday to pay homage to Polish army
officers massacred at Katyn in the Soviet Union during World War II.
   Behind a banner with the word ``Katyn'' painted in black, more
than 5,000 marchers carried urns of soil brought from the graves to
a workers' monument in front of the shipyard where Solidarity was
founded.
   The Rev. Henryk Jankowski, an adviser to Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa, celebrated Mass before the march.
   He demanded that ``everything be revealed'' about the massacre.
``We demand this in the name of arranging, finally, normal
relations with our eastern neighbor,'' Jankowski said. ``Nothing
cures better than truth and honesty.''
   Polish officials have long supported the Soviet account that the
more than 4,000 officers were killed in 1941 by the Nazis after the
Germans invaded the Soviet Union. But the government recently
indicated it may change its position to that of most Poles and
Western historians, who say the Soviet secret police carried out
the massacre on the orders of Soviet leader Josef Stalin in April
1940 when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were still allied.
   The Polish side of a joint commission studying the massacre and
other historical ``blank spots'' with the Soviets recently
presented what officials call circumstantial evidence of Soviet
responsibility. There has been no conclusion from the Soviet side.
   Jankowski also called for the truth about the fate of 10,000
Polish officers interned at two Soviet camps who disappeared at
about the same time. Presumed dead, their graves have never been
found.
   Officials gave permission for the march in Gdanks, which
dispersed peacefully except for a delegation of about 150
supporters of a Walesa rival who briefly confronted police.
Witnesses reported some stones were thrown at police, but the group
then dispersed and there were no detentions.

   The crush of humanity that killed 94
people at a British soccer stadium began in an impatient throng
outside, then swept through a tunnel and pummeled fans trapped
against a metal anti-riot fence.
   The immense power generated by shoving, struggling crowds pulled
burly youths off their feet, suffocated the strong and left people
helpless as their friends died in front of them.
   Survivors, many speaking from hospital beds, described
Saturday's disaster and the terrible minutes when people died
unnoticed by those out on Hillsborough field.
   ``I've never seen so many fans outside a ground,'' 18-year-old
Kevin Mulvaney told the Sheffield Star newspaper. ``There must have
been 4,000. We couldn't move. ... They were desperate to see the
game.
   ``One policeman said it would take an hour to get everybody in
and asked people with tickets to wave them in the air. Then the
police opened the gate in front of me and that was it. They must
have thought there was going to be trouble,'' Mulvaney said.
   Tom Bailey, 28, was standing outside the gate and said,
``Everyone was just pushing. Then when the match kicked off, there
was a massive shove and we just got jammed.''
   Stephen Dooling, 34, said, ``The police had to open the door
because the lads at the front were screaming,'' he said. ``They
would have died there at the turnstiles instead of in the ground.''
   After entering, many fans were trapped in a tunnel leading to a
center standing-room area.
   The crowd carried Dooling into the tunnel.
   ``There was nothing you could do. ... There were bodies
everywhere, and we all went on the floor.
   ``There were fellow Scousers (Liverpool residents) who were just
picking us up and getting us on our feet. I loved them for it,''
Dooling said. ``Some of them were big strong dockers and they were
brilliant. They used their strength to get everyone up.''
   Alan McNab, 43, said: ``There was one kid right in front of my
face. His lungs must have collapsed. He just turned blue and his
lips were purple. He did not go down _ the crowd held him up as the
crush was so tight _ but he was dead.''
   ``The police could do nothing at that time,'' McNab said. ``They
were in danger of being crushed to death themselves. But they
should never have opened the gate.''
   Ian Turner, 21, told the Sheffield Star: ``I was crushed and was
dangling two feet off the ground ... I wriggled free and saw this
bloke with his face all purple. I slapped him and slapped him but
he was dead.''
   Tony Delaney, 25, was caught in the tunnel and collapsed. He
regained consciousness as medical workers placed him against a wall.
   ``There was an old bloke next to me,'' Delaney said. ``He asked
me to hold his head in my arms. He said to me, `Help me!' and then
he just died in my arms.''
   Seventeen-year-old Wayne Adams said he was about five rows from
the front of the crowd.
   ``There were two youngsters standing near me about 5 or 6 years
old. One of them was bleeding because his face had been crushed
against the front barrier. I think their father was lying near
them. I think he was dead,'' he said.
   ``I helped the little ones climb over the barrier and that was
all I could do,'' Adams said.
   ``The police were as much help as they could be. When they
realized what was happening they just began trying to pull the
barriers down,'' Adams said.
   Soccer officials halted play six minutes into the game, but it
was many minutes before the extent of the disaster became clear and
the game was called off.
   Thomas Byrne, 37, said: ``People were walking on other people's
heads to get out from the crush. ... People were collapsing and
people were trying to push others out of the way to help those on
the floor. ...
   ``People were shouting for help to those at the front to open
the gates to let them be dragged out, but it seemed so slow in
opening the gates.''
   Steve Ellis, a photographer, said he could hear and see kids
screaming against the fence.
   ``More were coming in from the back, pushing forward. ... At
first the police were trying to stop the fans climbing over, but
when they realized how serious it was they could not get to them
because of the fencing.''
   ``I can still see the young lads behind the fence shouting,
`Save me!' I'll never forget it until the day I die.''

   Imagine paying about $7 to stand for two hours
inside a metal cage, with bodies pressed against you and swaying to
chants fueled by centuries of tradition and gallons of beer.
   Stage this uncomfortable scene in a damp, dark stadium that was
40 years old when World War II began, and you have an idea of what
it's like to watch a soccer game in England.
   As they tried to piece together what happened in a crush of
bodies that left 94 fans dead, English sports officials looked at
stadiums where their games are played and said Sunday old habits
may have been among the factors that led to the tragedy.
   ``The public determines whether they like a new development or
not,'' said Andy Williamson, spokesman for the Football League,
referring to efforts to end some traditions in English soccer.
``The clubs have come to the conclusion that they do not.''
   The deaths in the opening minutes of Saturday's soccer cup
semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest came in the
standing-room section known as the terraces. The victims were
crushed against concrete and steel as thousands of late-arriving
fans poured into the already packed area.
   Officials of the the international soccer federation, FIFA, and
the European counterpart, the Union of European Football
Associations, reiterated Sunday that standing-room sections should
be abolished. English officials said it wasn't that easy.
   ``Clubs have tried to change the way fans watch matches by
eliminating terraces and making their stadiums all-seating. But the
public in England demands the right to stand,'' said Jill Smith, an
administrator for the English Football Association.
   Ms. Smith noted that Coventry, one of the nation's biggest
clubs, was the latest to try to eliminate standing-room areas. It
didn't work.
   ``People wound up standing on the seats,'' she said. ``It's a
very traditional thing, a terribly emotive issue.''
   For someone used to the polished newness of professional
stadiums and arenas in the United States, the top sports facilities
in Britain come as a shock.
   The newest stadium among the 20 clubs in Division 1 was built in
1935. At least 10 teams, including Sheffield, have played in their
stadiums since the 1890s.
   Entrance generally is through a turnstile that squeezes a man of
normal height and weight. Concessions are few and lines are long.
There is no pre-game or halftime entertainment, nor even a
scoreboard clock at most fields.
   Seats are jammed together and posts supporting the upper deck
block the view.
   There are no posts in the terraces, but fans there _ having paid
a general admission fee of about $6.80 _ stand on bare concrete
ledges that ascend from the edge of the field to about 10 feet
above ground level. To watch the game, they must peer through a
steel mesh fence.
   These perimeter fences were installed in most Division 1
stadiums earlier this decade to cut down on crowd violence and keep
rowdy fans off the field. The bright blue fences at Sheffield's
Hillsborough Stadium, where Saturday's tragedy occurred, did that
job too well.
   ``Some of the measures we took to combat hooliganism may now
have turned on us,'' said Williamson.
   Hillsborough was built in 1899. It is counted as one of
England's top facilities, however, and Williamson said Sheffield
and many other first-division fields had undergone renovation since
World War II.
   But updating is one thing; tearing down an old field and moving
a club to a modern venue is another, and such changes have not yet
found support.
   ``Sometimes it was lack of money, sometimes the council has not
given approval, but the fans have never gotten behind the new
stadiums,'' Ms. Smith said. ``They have an emotional attachment to
the old ones.''
   Efforts to draw fans to stadiums early, to avoid the type of
last-minute rush that caused Saturday's disaster, also have not
worked, Williamson said.
   ``The public has been seen to be unexcited by any of the
entertainment that might be offered (before the game),'' he said.
   ``They find their own form of entertainment, whether that's
going to a pub or whatever.''

   Television talk show host Morton Downey Jr.
disputed reports that he would speak at a dinner to commemorate the
late Sen. Joseph McCarthy.
   ``There's absolutely no truth to it,'' Downey told The Milwaukee
Journal. ``I have no plans to attend.''
   Milwaukee lawyer Thomas Bergen, president of the Senator Joseph
McCarthy Educational Fund, said last week Downey would speak at the
May 7 event in Appleton. It honors the Republican senator who
gained notoriety for accusing a variety of public figures in the
1950s of promoting communism, often without substantiation.
   Downey said Friday that he did not know anything about the
McCarthy group.
   Bergen was quoted as describing Downey as ``a longtime supporter
of the senator's beliefs.'' But Downey, though a hotly opinionated
conservative, said he did not agree with the way McCarthy ``went
about his business.''
   McCarthy was censured by the U.S. Senate in 1954.
   On Friday, Bergen insisted that Downey had made a commitment by
telephone three months ago to speak, but had backed out later.
Bergen said he advertised the dinner as ``featuring'' Downey after
telling the TV host's staff he would settle for a tape of Downey.

climate for R&amp;B and folk music,'' she said in an interview in the
April 24 issue of People. ``If I had put this record out a few
years ago, no one would have played it.''
   Raitt, 39, has done some changing herself. Once a hard partier,
she said she hit bottom in the mid-'80s, with ``a complete
emotional, physical and spiritual breakdown.'' She said she made
her comeback with the help of psychotherapy, Alcoholics Anonymous
and weight loss inspired by a later-shelved album and video project
with Prince.
   The daughter of musical comedy star John Raitt is known chiefly
for a critically acclaimed series of blues-, rock- and
folk-inspired albums in the 1970s.

   Actors Paul Newman and Tom Cruise will
combine with former pro football star Walter Payton in an auto
racing effort this season.
   Newman and Scott Sharp, the 21-year-old son of Newman-Sharp
Racing team co-owner Bob Sharp, are expected to run some Sports Car
Club of America Trans-Am races, while Cruise and Payton will drive
in some other series. The still-sketchy plans were announced at a
team news conference Sunday.
   Newman, 64, a four-time national amateur champion and two-time
Trans-Am winner, has cut back his racing schedule this year. The
actor, who first raced in 1972 at the age of 47, said, ``As I
approach my dotage, I think it's time to do some testing and slow
it down a little bit.
   ``I said I'd stop driving when I got slower, and I think I'm
getting slower.''
   Later, away from the microphone, Newman said, ``I really want to
continue racing. But I really want to continue my craft (acting)
that I've developed for so many years, too. It's a hard juggling
act.''
   Payton, a former Chicago Bears' running back who began his
driving career a year ago in the Pro-Celebrity race in Long Beach,
has since driven in several Sports 2000 events.
   Cruise and Newman became friends during the filming of ``The
Color of Money'' in 1986.

   Kenichi Horie, the first Japanese sailor to
cross the Pacific alone, is embarked on a similar voyage in a
single-sail boat just 9 feet, 2 inches long.
   Horie set sail for Japan on Saturday in the white Mermaid, with
a beam of six feet.
   He said he is undertaking this adventure for the same reasons he
made a stormy crossing from Osaka to San Francisco in 94 days in a
19-foot sloop in 1962.
   ``Then, it was most wide ocean and smallest boat, and now this
time, it's the same thing too,'' said Horie, 50, before being towed
out under the Golden Gate Bridge to catch the outgoing tide.
   He expects the 6,700-mile journey to take about 100 days as he
takes advantage of trade winds to the north of Hawaii and back to
his homeland.
   Referring to his ship's computer-assisted design in Tokyo, Horie
said: ``We are Buddhists. We believe in God. We also believe in
Hewlett-Packard.''

<HEAD>Financially Troubled Jordan Raises Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Sunday announced steep price
increases on items ranging from gasoline to long-distance telephone
calls as part of an economic reconstruction program for the
financially troubled kingdom.
   Under an agreement with the International Monetary Fund
announced Friday, Jordan also plans to slash its budget deficit to
help solve its debt crisis.
   The agreement paves the way for Jordan to seek rescheduling or
refinancing of its $6 billion debt. It has already fallen behind on
some of the $1.2 billion repayments scheduled for this year.
   The price increases, announced by the official Jordan news
agency, do not affect subsidies on bread, milk, rice and other
staples.
   The price of regular gasoline was raised by 25 percent, to 41
cents a liter from 33 cents. A 20-pound bottle of cooking gas will
cost $3.70, up from $3.33.
   The price of imported cigarettes went from $1.20 to $1.57. The
cost of international phone calls and annual telephone rental fees
went up 10 percent.
   The government also raised the tax on alcoholic drinks from 20
percent to 50 percent for imported beverages and to 40 percent for
local beverages.
   Many workers in this country of 3 million people earn between
$185 and $370 a month. Families often have as many as seven to 10
children.
   The increases follow austerity measures imposed last year when
Jordan devalued the dinar by 40 percent and banned imports of many
luxury goods.
   Per capita income for Jordanians reached nearly $2,000 a year in
the early 1980s, but it has since declined to less than $1,200 a
year. That happened because Jordan is a small country that must
import many essential goods, whose local prices rose because as the
value of the dinar declined.
   The country ran into balance of payments problems when Arab aid
and remittances sent home by Jordanians in the Persian Gulf slumped
along with oil prices in the mid-1980s and Jordan continued to
borrow heavily.
   The kingdom, which produces little oil, has blamed its problems
in part on the failure of Arab oil states to pay it the bulk of the
$1 billion yearly they pledged for a decade at a 1978 Arab summit.

<HEAD>A Showgirl's Scandal Is News Once More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christine Keeler recalled explaining events more
than a quarter-century old to her teen-age son, Seymour.
   ``Years ago, I did say to Seymour, `You know, when I was
younger, I was more beautiful, and I did some naughty things
occasionally, if I wanted to. And I let somebody manipulate me, if
I wanted them to. But I knew that was wrong, and I didn't do it for
very long.'''
   But history has a tenacious memory, and Keeler is once again big
news. The former British showgirl whose liaisons with war minister
John Profumo and a Soviet naval attache rocked Harold Macmillan's
government in 1963 is at the center of a new movie and book, both
called ``Scandal.''
   ``I've finally got the truth out, which I've been trying to do
for a long time,'' said Keeler, who was 19 when osteopath Stephen
Ward, then her friend and mentor, introduced her to Profumo at a
party at Lord Astor's Cliveden estate in July 1961.
   A short affair ensued, as did a complex scenario mixing sex,
race, spies, and politics that made the working-class Keeler an
enduring household name.
   Twenty-eight years later, Keeler's notoriety is undimmed, even
if her black hair has started going gray and her skin now looks dry
and parched. She went unrecognized during a lunch interview with
The Associated Press and requested that no photographer be present.
   The film ``Scandal,'' directed by Michael Caton-Jones, closes
the American Film Institute@Los Angeles 1989 festival on April 27
and opens commercially across the United States the following day.
   Joanne Whalley-Kilmer plays Keeler opposite John Hurt as the
doomed Ward, who died of a drug overdose in 1963. That was the same
year Profumo, played by Ian McKellen, resigned from Macmillan's
Conservative Cabinet, helping to ensure the party's subsequent loss
in the 1964 elections.
   Keeler's book ``Scandal'' has its American publication in late
May or early June by St. Martin's Press.
   In conversation the day prior to a two-week promotional tour of
the United States, Keeler expressed mixed feelings about living off
her past.
   ``I don't want it to come across that I did it all for the
money, the film and everything. I'm right in the middle of (the
story), aren't I? I can't just suddenly stop.''
   But minutes later, bitterness set in.
   ``I've had it here (in Britain), I tell you. I seem to have
taken all the shame and the blame,'' she said, picking at her
avocado and bacon salad and smoking cigarettes. ``I owe this
country nothing for one reason: What have they ever done for me?''
   Keeler was once a darling of high society, watched over by Ward
and adored not only by Profumo but by Soviet Navy Capt. Eugene
Ivanov and two rival lovers, Johnnie Edgecombe and Aloysius
``Lucky'' Gordon.
   Now, she lives in low-income, high-rise housing. She is
desperate to move, perhaps to Australia.
   She has one son by each of her yearlong marriages: Seymour, 17,
a student and would-be actor; and Jimmy, 23, a computer engineer
who lives with Keeler's 65-year-old mother in Wokingham, west of
London.
   Keeler said she was glad about the movie ``Scandal'' because it
provided a platform for her book.
   ``I'd never have gotten the book out if there hadn't been a film
being made. To me, it's an umbrella to be able to come out with the
truth. It protects me, that film... It has put me up the social
ladder a couple of rungs.''
   She spoke admiringly of 25 year-old Joanne Whalley-Kilmer: ``I
couldn't take my eyes off Joanne not because she was playing me _
I've heard other people say that _ but because she's so brilliant;
she was so good.''
   But Keeler said she was ``just a bit disappointed'' by John
Hurt's widely acclaimed performance as Ward: ``He was too
good-looking; Stephen was more pompous.''
   She rejected claims that Ward was a scapegoat, a victim of the
establishment that resented his pretensions.
   ``Stephen shouldn't have died in such a terrible way; he should
have gone to prison for being a spy,'' she said. ``He was up to no
good ... he was a very dangerous man.''
   And she dismissed sentimental notions of the swinging 1960s.
   ``It's rubbish: My mother in the war (World War II) had a ball;
my son Seymour, he has a ball. It really makes me laugh the way
people say the swinging '60s.''
   ``It's still going on,'' she said.

<DATELINE>ROTENBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A train carrying explosive
chemicals derailed near the central rail station of this northern
city and forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 residents Sunday.
   No one was injured in the accident late Saturday, but 22 cars
derailed, including the tankers carrying propylene oxide and
tolylene diisocyanate, poisonous explosive chemicals used in making
dyes and solvents.
   Police said the first attempt to lift three overturned tankers
carrying the chemicals failed because the cars were ``crushed
together like an accordion.''
   A larger crane was brought in and removed the three tankers late
Sunday, police reported.
   Regional government director Gerhard Blume said there appeared
to have been no leaks from the overturned tankers, which are owned
by the Dow Chemical Co. based in Midland, Mich.
   Police said more than 1,000 residents of the area were roused
from their homes and evacuated to City Hall early Sunday because of
the danger of explosions during the sensitive operation to right
the overturned tankers.
   Juergen Erdmann of the federal railroad office said the evacuees
were told they could return home later in the day and the busy
Bremen-Hamburg line was reopened.
   Rotenburg lies along the Wuemme River about 20 miles east of
Bremen and has a population of more than 140,000.

   The increasing numbers of ``couch potatoes''
enlisting in the Army are getting injured so often that the brass
has instructed drill sergeants to add some ``low-impact'' exercise
to basic training.
   ``It's our opinion that the young people coming into the
military now have spent more time in front of the TV than on the
tennis court or a softball field,'' said Lt. Col. John Anderson, an
Army podiatrist who says he can't remember recruits being in worse
condition in his 20-year career.
   A new Army directive says the third week of boot camp, when
out-of-shape recruits apparently become particularly vulnerable,
will consist of low-impact aerobics, which are exercises that
involve constant movement but not running and jumping.
   ``The third week was standing out as the place where most of
those avoidable injuries were showing up,'' said Richard Dowling, a
spokesman for Fort Dix, one of the Army's eight basic training
posts.
   ``I'll say that naturally everyone had sore muscles, beginning
with day 2. But the accumulation over two weeks, and especially the
accumulation into the third week, would lead to relatively more
serious injuries,'' he said.
   Anderson, stationed at Fort Dix's Walson Army Hospital,
attributed the injuries to inactivity among the Army's prime pool
for recruits, high school students.
   ``They really are in poor condition,'' he said. ``Nationally,
many school systems are not making physical education a mandatory
course, or it's being dropped back to once a week. That certainly
has had an impact on the general condition of the incoming
trainee.''
   Only New Jersey and Illinois require four full years of high
school gym class, and New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean has proposed
eliminating the mandate.
   Besides Fort Dix, the Army posts affected by the directive are
Fort Jackson, S.C.; Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.; Fort Knox, Ky.; Fort
Benning, Ga.; Fort Sill, Okla.; Fort Bliss, Texas; and Fort
McClelland, Ala.
   The directive was issued by Lt. Gen. John Crosby from Fort
Monroe, Va.
   Col. Margarete DiBenedetto, a physician whose recommendations
led to the directive, said research shows stress fractures affected
as many as 10 percent of the recruits at some posts, although most
posts showed fracture rates ranging between 2 and 4 percent.
   ``No matter what study or which post, in the third week and
again in the fifth or sixth weeks _ two peaks _ there was an
increase in stress fractures,'' she said. She added that even a 1
percent sick call by recruits is too costly.
   DiBenedetto said research within the last year show that
reducing running and jumping in the third week lessened associated
injuries. The studies also showed better physical conditioning and
faster running times for a group whose workouts were reduced in the
third week, compared with a control group.
   Under the new policy, male recruits in special cases may be
required to run, but no more than two miles with at least three
days rest in between workouts. Female recruits are barred from any
running in the third week. Instead, recruits will perform aerobic
exercises, such as swimming or bicycling.
   And should it be called boot camp anymore, with new soldiers
required to wear Army-approved running shoes when they run?
   ``They used to, years ago, wear from the time they arrived until
the time they left combat boots,'' Anderson said. But running shoes
have made some difference in the number of foot injuries the Army
is treating, Anderson said.
   Anderson said the drill sergeants were not soured by the
reduction in pushing young recruits, but DiBenedetto said there was
a backlash to her recommendation.
   ``With the good old macho Army concept, there is a lot of
opposition to this,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   When popes and presidents have something
to say to Polish-Americans, they reach for a map of Detroit and put
their finger on this 2.1-square-mile community nestled in the heart
of the Motor City.
   Hamtramck's heartbeat lately has fallen somewhat out of synch
with the polka. But the vitality of a community built early this
century by immigrants still pulses in its streets.
   On Monday, a limousine will roll down Joseph Campau Avenue,
passing the Malsija Bar, Restauracja Pod Orlem (``Under the
Eagle''), Kowalski Sausage, the John Paul II Book Store and an
elevated, 12-foot bronze statue of the Polish pope to take George
Bush to City Hall.
   There, the president is scheduled to deliver a speech outlining
steps to aid the economy of Poland, whose Communist government has
agreed to hold partly free elections and restore legal status to
the independent trade union Solidarity.
   All 10,000 free tickets to the speech were snapped up by Sunday
afternoon, said Paul Odrobina, president of both the City Council
and the Michigan division of the Polish American Congress, where
the tickets were distributed.
   Never mind that Democrat Michael Dukakis took Hamtramck by a
2-to-1 margin last November. Never mind that Chicago and the
outlying Detroit suburbs of Warren and Sterling Heights each have
greater numbers of Polish-Americans.
   Bush will be only the latest to pay homage to the enclave of
21,000, which has welcomed Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry Truman,
John F. Kennedy, Ronald Reagan and, in September 1987, John Paul II.
   ``Hamtramck is like a magnet,'' said Poland-born Frank
Pawlowski, 73, a resident who came to the United States in 1952.
``It brings in dignitaries like no other city in the U.S.''
   ``It's a great town when you live here,'' said Dave Uchalik, 34,
a Hamtramck native and lead singer with the Polish Muslims, which
for seven years has crossbred polka and punk-rock music in local
clubs.
   ``But people, in all frankness, are a little bit awed by it,''
Uchalik said of the city's latest celebrity visit. ``Surprisingly,
I guess, we have a nationwide reputation.''
   ``I guess basically it's the identification as a Polish
community,'' said the Rev. Stanley Ulmon, pastor of St. Ladislaus
Church, one of three Roman Catholic parishes in Hamtramck. ``It
still embodies a lot of the traditions that the immigrants brought
over.''
   Between 50 percent and 60 percent of Hamtramck's residents are
of Polish extraction, Odrobina said. But blacks, Ukrainians and
Yugoslavs also have made Hamtramck their home for years, followed
more recently by Pakistanis, Albanians, Arabs and others.
   It's an ethnic mix reminiscent of Detroit at the height of its
auto industry-driven might several decades ago and still alive in
smaller scale.
   ``It's got a background and a history that won't get lost in a
bigger setting,'' Ulmon said. ``It's a smaller part of the world,
small enough to make (Bush's visit) big enough.''
   ``Maybe another factor about Hamtramck is its survival,'' he
said. ``Even while the city of Detroit has slipped and fallen, in
Hamtramck crime remains low. There's a feeling of community.''
   But the average St. Ladislaus member's age has risen to 65,
Ulmon said.
   ``There aren't a lot of young people in Hamtramck,'' he said.
``I think right now the issue is economic. The people who can
afford to move to the suburbs will do so.
   ``But you have two types of groups coming up _ the new
immigrants and a third generation of Poles who are just discovering
these traditions and roots,'' the priest said. ``There's a
richness, a color, a feeling that people want to recapture.''
   ``It's still alive,'' Pawlowski said after picking up four
tickets for Bush's speech. ``It's more alive than five years ago.''

<HEAD>Survivors of Khmer Rouge Urge Adoption of Human Rights</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ten years after the Khmer Rouge's
brutal reign in Cambodia, 1,000 survivors of its labor camps and
torture chambers are urging adoption of human rights treaties in
their nation.
   ``We are aware ... that the international community may go along
with those who want to dump the Khmer Rouge back on to the
Cambodian people,'' said Kassie S. Neou, who survived the Koch Ro
Teh execution center in Battambang province.
   Fears of a Khmer Rouge return heightened after Vietnam announced
it will withdraw its 50,000 troops from Cambodia by Sept. 30.
Vietnam's 1978 invasion ended the communist group's nearly
four-year attempt to turn Cambodia into a primitive communal
agriculture society.
   The survivors, living in exile, sent the appeal letter, dated
Monday, to Hun Sen, premier of the Vietnamese-installed government
in Cambodia, and to guerrilla leaders opposing him: Prince Norodom
Sihanouk and Son Sann of the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
   The Cambodian adversaries have engaged in unprecedented peace
negotiations in the past year and Sihanouk and Hun Sen are to meet
again next month in Indonesia.
   No letter was sent to the Khmer Rouge, the third partner in the
guerrilla coalition and blamed in the death of more than 2 million
of the 8 million population during their 1974-79 rule.
   The appeal was spearheaded by Dith Pran, a New York Times
photographer whose escape to Thailand was depicted in the 1984
movie ``The Killing Fields'' and Haing S. Ngor, the Academy
Award-winning actor who portrayed him.
   ``Fourteen years ago today, Cambodia entered the darkest period
of our 2,000-year history,'' said the letter. ``We are not yet free
from the memory, the loss and the tragic chain of events that has
befallen Cambodia since April 17, 1975.''
   On that day, victorious over the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government,
the Khmer Rouge entered the capital of Phnom Penh, executed
opponents and drove the city's residents, including bedridden
hospital patients, to the countryside.
   The letter asked the Cambodian leaders to abide by the
International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the
Crime of Genocide, the International Human Rights Convenants and
other internationally approved declarations.
   It asked all parties to facilitate human rights monitoring and
education by Cambodian and international agencies after the
Vietnamese withdraw.
   ``Our hopes for peace are tinged with fear because we do not
believe the tiger has changed its stripes,'' said the letter, which
noted that the Khmer Rouge recently forcibly relocated refugees in
its camps in Thailand.
   There have been reports that the Khmer Rouge has hidden arms
caches for an all-out offensive after the Vietnamese pullout.
   The survivors urged the international community to bring the
Khmer Rouge atrocities before the International Court of Justice at
the Hague.
   The U.N. General Assembly in November added to its annual
resolution on Cambodia an unprecedented condemnation of the
policies of the Khmer Rouge era. The U.S. Congress also adopted an
anti-Khmer Rouge resolution, signed into law in October.

   Daniel Webster would not have understood the
Jim Wright affair.
   When Webster was in the Senate, 1828-50, a fellow lawmaker
charged that he was ``bound hand and foot'' to wealthy backers who
had come up with a fund to support his extravagant life style.
   What, asked Rep. William Yancey of Alabama, was the
Massachusetts senator being paid for?
   Webster, although he had accepted such a fund, didn't bother to
answer.
   Things have changed between the 1840's and the 1980's.
   House Speaker Wright, a Texas Democrat expected to be formally
charged by the House ethics committee Monday with several dozen
rules violations including accepting free use of a condominium and
car from a Texas businessman, has asked for a chance to answer as
soon as possible.
   ``Webster gave no indication ... of being embarrassed when the
matter (of the fund) came up in Congress,'' biographer Irving H.
Bartlett has written. ``That the public might interpret such a
transaction as evidence of the corruption of an elected
representative of the people seems not to have occurred to him.''
   Since Webster's day, however, members of Congress periodically
have been investigated for accepting financial or sexual favors and
for other misdeeds.
   Four representatives and 15 senators have been expelled in the
200-year history of Congress, beginning in 1797 when Sen. William
Blount of Tennessee was accused of conspiring with the British and
the Indian tribes to conquer West Florida.
   The most recent member to be expelled, and the first in 126
years, was Rep. Michael Myers, a Pennsylvania Democrat convicted in
the Abscam bribery scandal, in 1980.
   Last year, Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., convicted in the Wedtech
scandal, resigned after the House scheduled a vote on an ethics
committee recommendation to expel him.
   Censure, the stiffest punishment short of expulsion, has been
voted for seven senators, including Wisconsin Republican Joseph
McCarthy in 1954 and Sen. Thomas J. Dodd, D-Conn., in 1967.
McCarthy was censured for actions ``contrary to senatorial
traditions'' in his investigations of alleged communism and Dodd on
financial grounds.
   It is more than a slap on the wrist.
   ``I think it must be hard for anyone who has not served in the
Senate of the United States to comprehend how devastating censure
can be to a senator,'' Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the former
Senate majority leader, has said. ``Censure does not remove a
member's right to vote or speak or serve on committees. But, in as
collegial a body as this, censure is an awesome punishment, and,
from all accounts, Senator McCarthy suffered mightily as a result.''
   Twenty-three members have been censured by the House, most
recently Reps. Daniel B. Crane, R-Ill., and Gerry E. Studds,
D-Mass., in 1983 for sexual misconduct with congressional pages.
Crane was defeated for re-election the next year, but Studds is
still in Congress.
   The mildest form of punishment, a reprimand, was instituted in
1975 and has been meted out to a half dozen members of the House.
The most recent was Rep. Austin Murphy, a five-term Pennyslvania
Democrat, rebuked in 1987 for having someone else cast votes for
him on the House floor. Murphy was re-elected last year.
   Rep. George V. Hansen, R-Idaho, was reprimanded in 1984 after
being convicted by a federal court jury of filing false financial
disclosure forms. He was defeated for re-election after his
conviction but before going to prison, where he served just over a
year.
   One of the most sensational cases in recent years involved Rep.
Wayne L. Hays, D-Ohio, who admitted a ``personal relationship''
with staff member Elizabeth Ray but denied hiring her to be his
mistress. Hays resigned in 1976 after the ethics panel voted to
hold public hearings on his case.
   Although the House ethics committee was formed in 1969, it did
not conduct a formal investigation until 1976, when it reprimanded
Rep. Robert Sikes of Florida for a conflict of interest.
   Even before the committee and its procedures, however, the House
was disciplining its members.
   One of the first big scandals came in the 1870's, when Rep.
Oakes Ames of Massachusetts was censured for accepting shares of
stock at bargain prices from Credit Mobilier, a construction
company seeking to obtain favors and block an investigation of its
corrupt practices.

   A weekend rally attracted more than 2,000
opponents of the Chippewa tribe's court-affirmed treaty rights on
fishing, and organizers angry over what they see as unfair
treatment of non-Indian fishermen vowed to disrupt the tribe's
upcoming spearfishing season.
   ``We will take whatever steps are necessary to hinder, minimize
or stop the terrible injustice granted by our liberal judges,'' Al
Soik, of Stop Treaty Abuse-Wisconsin, said at Saturday's rally.
   ``We have organized lake watch groups to coordinate our efforts
so we can have the maximum amount of people at each spearing
site,'' Soik added.
   Chippewas claim that in the Treaty of 1854, in which they ceded
land to the federal government, they retained the right to hunt,
spear fish and gather wild grain in northern Wisconsin, even off
their reservations.
   Federal courts have agreed, and a recent ruling said the tribe
can regulate its own season within certain conservation guidelines.
   Quotas announced by the tribe Wednesday, including ones set at
100 percent of the number of walleyes biologists say can be safely
taken from 14 lakes, mean non-Indian sports angling will be
restricted on some lakes to catch-and-release or a lower bag limit,
state officials have said.
   In addition, non-Indian anglers are not permitted to use spears
to catch prized game fish such as the walleye. They must use the
less efficient bait and tackle method.
   This will be the fifth year that tribal members have speared
fish off reservation. Past seasons have been marked by noisy
protests at the lakes, some name-calling and rock-throwing and a
few arrests.
   Several dozen tribal members and treaty supporters listened to
the rally.
   Tom Maulson, a Lac du Flambeau Chippewa tribal judge and
spearfishing organizer, said the tribe adheres to court rules and
biologists' advice about the number of fish that can be speared.
   ``I see people up there wanting our blood,'' Maulson said,
referring to the protesters. ``There's a lot of hate signs up
there.''
   Saturday's rally, organized by Soik's group and another calling
itself Protect Americans Rights and Resources, was disrupted by
boos when two women carrying signs in support of the treaty rights
stood in front of the American flag by a platform where the treaty
opponents were speaking.
   One of the women did not leave when police approached. Oneida
County District Attorney Brian Maloney said she was arrested for
disorderly conduct.
   Police estimated the crowd at more than 2,000. More than two
dozen police officers from throughout northern Wisconsin patrolled
the area.
   William H. Covey, president of the Citizens for Equal Rights
Alliance based in Montana, said fights over Indian treaty rights
for land, water and fish and game also were under way in New
Mexico, New York, Washington, South Dakota, Montana, Nebraska and
Idaho.

<DATELINE>HOMER, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The end of the Homer Spit, normally stacked
high with crab pots and crowded with fishing boats, has become a
bustling yard where floating booms are built to stand guard against
a massive oil slick.
   What started as a four-man volunteer crew Monday has turned into
an operation employing nearly 100 people, turning out four or five
miles of log barriers daily in hopes of keeping away the remnants
of the nation's worst oil spill.
   ``I've been working construction crews for 20 years, and this is
the hardest-working one I've ever seen,'' said Ed Schofield, as he
strode through the chaotic log yard Saturday. ``They're not doing
it for the money. They're working from the heart.''
   Hammers clattered and chain saws made a guttural drone as oil
from the tanker Exxon Valdez edged closer to Kachemak Bay, a busy
fishing port on the southern end of the Kenai Peninsula.
   The bay's icy blue water wraps around glacier-topped mountains
cut by gin-clear streams. Its coves and harbors are home to salmon,
halibut, clams, crab and an abundance of marine mammals and birds.
   The thought of losing it all to the oil blackening the southern
Alaska coast prompted Schofield and three friends to begin
scrounging materials for makeshift booms.
   ``We wanted to protect our bay,'' he said. ``Nobody else would
do it. If we didn't do something, we'd be buying our clams from
someplace in the Lower 48.''
   By Tuesday, 20 volunteers had shown up. Forty were on hand
Wednesday when Exxon gave the project its blessing, and the work
force swelled steadily through the week with the oil company paying
wages starting at $16.69 an hour.
   The boom building was halted temporarily Sunday. Strong wind and
high seas prevented boats from picking up the completed logs,
creating a backup in the yard. Ray Springer, local boss for a
subcontractor working for Exxon, said work would resume Monday.
   The floating booms are makeshift but effective barriers.
   One side of a 30-foot Sitka spruce log is shaved and plastic
sheeting is nailed down beneath a two-by-four. Links of chain or
cable are inserted as ballast in a sleeve at the bottom of the
plastic so the curtain will hang vertically in the water to keep
oil from seeping under the logs.
   Cable is threated through holes bored in the ends of the logs to
tie the sections of boom together.
   While a southerly wind threatens to bring the oil slick closer,
15-hour days apparently aren't tiring the eager crew, all from the
Homer area.
   ``It's no good to ask them, because they'll tell you they're not
tired,'' Schofield said. ``The energy here is just unbelievable.''
   As his crew grew and the pace quickened, Schofield sought help
feeding everyone at the site and his plea on the local public radio
station drew a quick response.
   ``About an hour later, I had stew, hot chili, soup, cases of
apples, everything,'' he said. ``The people here see an opportunity
to do something (about the spill).''
   Material is another story. The logs, from the Anchor Point area
of the Kenai Peninsula, probably will last another week. But
half-inch chain and cable clamps are dwindling fast and no more are
to be found in Alaska, he said.
   With Exxon expediting orders, some shipments have started
arriving from the Lower 48, Schofield said.
   Despite the enthusisasm with which everyone was attacking the
job, one worker called the scene ``sad,'' and wondered aloud if it
was accomplishing much.
   ``It looks like a big effort, but a lot of us feel we're just
wasting our time,'' said the worker, who asked to remain
unidentified in the face of an oil industry threat to fire any
employee who talks to reporters without prior written approval.
   ``I just kind of hope it's a worthwhile effort,'' he said.
   Schofield said no one told him he couldn't talk to reporters.
``It wouldn't do any good if they did,'' he muttered. ``We're just
not going to let anybody stop us.''

   Dutch soccer fans smashed store
windows, hurled bricks at police and fought with rival spectators
Sunday, and 27 people were injured and 24 arrested, police said.
   The violence came one day after 94 people were crushed to death
in a mad rush at a soccer match in Sheffield, England.
   Before Sunday's match between Ajax of Amsterdam and the
Feyenoord team from Rotterdam, the visiting fans went on a rampage,
smashing the interior of a subway train and windows of nearby
shops, said police spokesman Klaas Wilting.
   Scuffles broke out before and after the match, which began 15
minutes late because of the unrest, Wilting said.
   Police wearing riot gear had to make several baton charges on
the stands of the Olympic Stadium and in surrounding streets in
order to keep the rival groups of fans apart, he said.
   Most of those arrested were being held on suspicion of violent
behavior, including hurling bricks at police, Wilting said.
   He said 24 soccer fans and three police officers were injured,
and 10 of those were hospitalized.
   There was no immediate word on the extent of the damage, Wilting
said.
   The match ended in a 4-1 victory for Ajax, and the visiting fans
left Amsterdam quietly later in the afternoon, Wilting said.

   For the third time in two years, federal
prosecutors will present a heroin trafficking case against Gene
Gotti, the brother of reputed mob boss John Gotti.
   Opening arguments in the trial of Gene Gotti and John Carneglia
are scheduled for Monday morning in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn. Both are accused of being members of the Gambino
organized crime group, which Gene Gotti reputedly heads.
   An indictment in 1983 charged Gene Gotti and nine others with
participating in a multimillion-dollar criminal enterprise that
smuggled hundreds of pounds of heroin into the metropolitan area.
   The first trial ended in January 1988, after eight months of
testimony, when prosecutors raised allegations of jury tampering. A
second mistrial was declared in July when jurors announced they
were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict.

   A Coast Guard cutter was sailing to Haiti on Sunday
to return 137 would-be refugees picked up in the Windward Passage
off Cuba, where a record flow of boats is trying to reach Florida
from Haiti, a spokesman said.
   A second cutter has been assigned to double the U.S. patrol in
the waters between Cuba and the Bahamas and airplane surveillance
also has been increased, Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Karonis said.
   ``There are so many boats coming near our shores we decided it
was best to try to block them nearer the source,'' said Karonis.
   Refugees coming within three miles of the U.S. shore must be
given a full hearing to determine whether they are eligible for
admission as refugees fleeing political persecution.
   The Coast Guard has intercepted nearly 2,200 Haitians at sea
this year.

<HEAD>AIDS Research Funds Being Used for AZT Treatments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government is dipping into
research money and other accounts for millions of dollars to buy
AZT for needy AIDS patients because Congress reauthorized the free
drug program without appropriating money to pay for it.
   The program was to expire last September, but was extended
without an appropriation. Congressional leaders subsequently made
clear they expected Health and Human Services officials to tap
other AIDS accounts as necessary to find the money.
   Although the program is authorized at $15 million for the
current fiscal year, the company that makes the drug _ Burroughs
Wellcome _ is picking up $5 million of the cost by making that much
of the drug available free.
   The remaining $10 million had to be found elsewhere in the HHS
budget.
   Because the National Institutes of Health receives almost half
of HHS's total AIDS budget _ about $607 million of the $1.3 billion
budget _ the largest share of the amount shifted to AZT purchases
is coming from NIH research funds.
   The NIH ``contribution'' in all is $7.4 million, with about $6
million of that coming from research funds.
   Based on the average NIH research grant level of $162,000, the
cut would mean 37 projects would not get federal backing that
otherwise would if the money had not been diverted.
   The agencies required to shift funds are overseen by a panel of
the Senate Appropriations Committee, which directed the action.
   The Centers for Disease Control was hit for about $3 million.
   Other HHS agencies tapped include the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and
Mental Health Administration, the office of the assistant secretary
of health, and the Health Resources and Services Administration.
   AZT is the only drug approved for treatment of AIDS, which costs
about $8,000 per year per patient.
   About 7,000 of the estimated 30,000 AIDS patients taking AZT are
receiving the drug through the federal program, which is partially
financed by the states.

   The House decides this week whether to accept
or reject a federal commission's recommendations to shut down 86
military installations and partly close five more.
   A vote on a resolution to disapprove the report of the
Commission on Base Realignment and Closure is scheduled for
Tuesday, and the full House is expected to follow the lead of its
Armed Services Committee. The panel voted 43-4 last month to
support the commission's report.
   Savings from the plan, which also includes substantial changes
at 54 other facilities, were estimated at $694 million a year
initially and $5.6 billion over 20 years.
   The Senate, meanwhile, takes up President Bush's $90 billion
plan to bail out and reform the savings and loan industry, with
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, promising to
resolve the issue by week's end.
   The federal S&amp;L insurance fund is now more than $25 billion in
debt because of bad loans and, in some cases, fraudulent lending
and accounting practices using government-insured deposits.
   In House debate last week over base closings, representatives
from New Jersey, Illinois and California pleaded with their
colleagues to pass the disapproval resolution, claiming the
commission's report was ``tragically flawed.''
   Rep. Jim Courter, R-N.J., who is opposed to the recommendation
to close New Jersey's Fort Dix, said the data used by the panel was
based on ``incorrect information and clerical error.''
   Rep. Ed Madigan, R-Ill., said no member of the commission
visited Chanute Air Force Base in his state and charged that
closing the facility ``will not achieve the alleged cost savings.''
   But according to law, the commission's recommendations must be
accepted in their entirety. If the resolution of disapproval fails,
the plan will go into effect next month, with base closings to
begin in 1990.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said, ``I hear the pain of many members whose
bases will be closed in their districts,'' but reminded her
colleagues that the House voted for legislation creating the
commission.
   The Senate is continuing to hold hearings on the issue.
   The S&amp;L bailout plan is gaining momentum in Congress after
surviving its biggest challenge as Democrats agreed last week to
Bush's financing plan, which is designed to keep the $50 billion
taxpayer cost from showing up in the federal deficit.
   While the Senate considers the bill, the House Banking Committee
also takes up the measure. Tougher capital and regulatory
requirements that Bush backed but were lost in subcommittee action
may be reinstated.
   ``By the time it's all over, he (Bush) may get 90 to 95 percent
of what he wants,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a
subcommittee member.

   The Soviets lifted the veil Sunday on the worst
disaster of their space program with a magazine article that blamed
a 1960 launchpad explosion on the race to catch up with the
Americans.
   The weekly Ogonyok said program workers flouted safety rules in
their haste to develop the first Soviet intercontinental ballistic
missile, the R-16.
   The magazine's article came as the Soviet Union was reeling from
setbacks in its space program and some citizens were calling for
cutbacks in research funds.
   The Tass news agency said Saturday that Soviet scientists have
abandoned efforts to re-establish contact with an unmanned probe
sent to Mars, meaning they have lost touch with both Phobos
spacecraft launched at a cost of $480 million.
   It said the decision to discontinue attempts to reach Phobos-2
was taken by a commission investigating why contact was originally
lost March 27. Contact with the other Mars probe, Phobos-1, was
lost in September because an erroneous command was beamed to the
spacecraft from Earth.
   Sunday's Ogonyok article said the 1960 accident incinerated
victims on the launchpad, including the director of its rocket
program.
   Chief Artillery Marshal Mitrofan I. Nedelin, a World War II
veteran serving as the first commander of the newly created Soviet
rocket forces, was about 60 feet from the missile when it exploded,
the article said.
   The magazine said ``a significant number'' of people died in the
explosion and fireball at the secret launch pad at Tura-Tam near
the Aral Sea. It said ``practically nothing was left _ only some
metal change, keys, etc.''
   Then-Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev said in memoirs published in
the West that dozens of soldiers and workers perished.
   ``A stream of fire burst out of the rocket, inundating
everything around it,'' the article said. ``People tried to escape
by running to the covered area where cars and other equipment were,
but the road literally melted in front of them, blocking the escape
route,'' a survivor recalled, according to Ogonyok.
   James E. Oberg, a U.S. space consultant knowledgeable about the
Soviet space program, has written that ``a million pounds of
kerosene and liquid oxygen flared up in a pyre which must have been
visible for hundreds of miles.
   ``In terms of human lives lost, it was probably the greatest
disaster of the Space Age,'' he said.
   Accounts of the disaster on Oct. 24, 1960, have circulated
abroad, but Ogonyok's report was the first in official Soviet media.
   It differed from Oberg's description in his 1988 book
``Uncovering Soviet Disasters: Exploring the Limits of Glasnost''
by saying Nedelin and his men died while preparing for the maiden
flight of the Soviets' first intercontinental ballistic missile.
   Oberg said they were preparing to launch an unmanned probe of
Mars.
   Ogonyok said launch of the R-16 had been scheduled for Oct. 23
but was postponed because of an electrical defect in the engine. It
said the problem was causing a fuel leak.
   Hatches were removed and welding work undertaken on the fully
fueled rocket, Ogonyok said. It called the move ``one of the
gravest violations of safety precautions.''
   Late the next day, the R-16's launch was scheduled in 30
minutes, the magazine said. But workers were still installing an
electrical distributor, which somehow gave a command to ignite the
rocket's second stage, the magazine said.
   The flames from the ignition burned through the fuel tanks of
the first stage, touching off the fire and explosion, the article
said.
   Failures and deaths in the Soviet space program were once a
taboo subject in the Soviet press. The magazine said it is now
possible to report the circumstances of the accident because of the
greater openness permitted under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
glasnost campaign.
   Tass says the Soviet space program, which has concentrated on
the Mir space station and unmanned planetary probes, costed about
$2 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Much Colder Air Enters The Northern High Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Colder air mixed with snow pushed onto the northern Plains on
Sunday, and an area of widespread rain along the northern East
Coast gradually moved out to sea.
   The cold air followed a frontal system across Manitoba and
Saskatchewan into the northern Plains. Temperatures fell into the
20s and 30s over the northern Rockies.
   Snowshowers developed east of the Rockies from northern Montana
into western North Dakota. Ahead of the front, rain developed
across southern parts of Montana into parts of the northern Plains.
   A second cold front extended across the upper Great Lakes into
the middle Missouri Valley, and scattered showers broke out ahead
of it over eastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois.
   Low pressure over the Atlantic Ocean south of Cape Cod produced
widespread rain across northern and central New England into parts
of the mid-Atlantic coast. By late afternoon, rain had stopped
falling at New York City as the low moved farther out to sea.
   One to two inches of rain was reported in 24 hours over parts of
New England. Providence, R.I., got an even 2 inches, New York
City's LaGuardia airport got 1.15 inches, and Portland, Maine, had
nearly an inch of rain.
   Temperatures rose into the 90s across the desert Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 20
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 93 at Lubbock, Texas. Sunday's low
for the 48 contiguous states was 22 at Cut Bank, occurring just
before noon.
   For Monday, widespread showers and scattered thunderstorms were
forecast from the central and eastern Great Lakes through the Ohio
Valley into the middle Mississippi Valley. Scattered showers and
thunderstorms also were forecast across extreme southern Florida.
   Highs in the 30s and 40s were predicted from the northern Plains
into the upper Great Lakes; in the 50s from the northern Rockies
through the middle Missouri Valley into the lower Great Lakes, and
across northern New England; in the 80s from the central California
valleys through the southern Rockies and lower Mississippi Valley
into Florida; in the 90s across the desert Southwest; and in the
60s or 70s across much of the rest of the nation.

<HEAD>Thousands Protest Plans For Short-Range Missiles</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators on
Sunday protested plans to modernize NATO's short-range nuclear
missiles in Europe, an issue on the agenda of an alliance meeting
this week.
   ``Do not modernize the missiles _ scrap them,'' the
demonstrators chanted as they marched through central Brussels.
   Organizers said 75,000 people participated. Police put the
figure at just more than 21,000.
   ``More than ever, demonstrations are necessary,'' said Hugo
Ongena, a spokesman for anti-nuclear activists who organized the
march.
   Belgium's center-left coalition government said Tuesday it
wanted NATO to delay plans to modernize its short-range nuclear
arms in Europe and agree to open East-West negotiations on the
issue as soon as possible.
   West Germany has taken a similar position.
   The United States and Britain seek a swift commitment to
upgrading the missiles, including extending their range, now about
70 miles. The two countries also reject any East-West negotiations
in view of the Warsaw Pact's superiority in these arms.
   The issue is to be debated on Wednesday and Thursday at a
meeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, where the alliance
has its headquarters.
   Anti-nuclear activists in Belgium want all nuclear missiles
removed from Europe. Ongena had mixed feelings about the
government's plans to ask for East-West talks and a delay in
modernizing the missiles.
   ``We don't flunk the government but it doesn't graduate with
distinction,'' he said.

   CORSIER-SUR-VEVEY, Switzerland (AP) _ Festooned streets
overflowed with people wearing bowler hats and baggy trousers as
thousands joined to commemorate the 100th birthday of Charlie
Chaplin, who died in 1977.
   The English comedian spent the last 25 years of his life in
Corsier and was the most famous resident of this wine-producing
village overlooking Lake Geneva.
   ``His films leave us a poignant message of justice and
equality,'' said Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz who spoke at
a ceremony dedicating a park to Chaplin at nearby Vevey.
   Also attending the ceremony was British Ambassador Christopher
Long, who praised Chaplin as ``a unique and extraordinary
phenomenon.''
   The solemn tributes were of little interest to the costumed
children assembled in the park. They were entertained by David Lee
Parsons, an American impersonator of Chaplin who has performed as
the ``little tramp'' in many countries.
   The Chaplin family was represented by the comedian's son
Michael, Michael's wife and two of their children.
   Chaplin's wife, Lady Oona, remained home at the Manoir de Ban,
the 18th century manor that Chaplin bought in 1953. A spokesman for
the organizers of the centennial celebration, Jean-Charles Kollros,
said Mrs. Chaplin was not feeling well enough to attend.
   Thousands of people watched the hour-long procession from Vevey
to Corsier despite a continuous rain that didn't dampen the spirits
of children in the parade, their costumes covered by plastic
raincoats.
   Other events of the day included showings of Chaplin's films,
concerts featuring music he composed and an exhibition of documents
and photographs illustrating his career.

<HEAD>Study Finds Cocaine Abuse Leads To Increased Risk Of Stroke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID ROCKS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine abusers, especially those who use the
drug's purer ``crack'' form, are more likely than others to suffer
strokes or cerebral hemorrhages, researchers said Sunday.
   Dr. Patti Peterson, chief of neurology at Detroit Receiving
Hospital, said a three-year study found that 3 percent of cocaine
abusers admitted to the hospital suffered strokes or hemorrhages,
the rupture or clogging of a blood vessel in the brain.
   Most of the abusers were young adults, with an average age of
35, she said.
   ``I don't think the coke abusers know what they're getting
into,'' Ms. Peterson said. ``Three out of a hundred _ I don't like
those odds.''
   She said the abusers had a ``much higher'' rate of strokes than
others. ``There's no way that 3 percent of the 35-year-olds who are
admitted to the hospital have strokes,'' she said.
   The rate of stroke in the general population of similar age is
about 0.05 percent, she said.
   Ms. Peterson and Dr. Patricia Moore, a neurologist at the
hospital, presented their conclusions at the annual meeting of the
American Academy of Neurology.
   From July 1985 to June 1988, they studied 979 cocaine abusers
admitted to the hospital for various reasons. Of those patients, 33
suffered strokes or cerebral hemorrhages. Six of those 33 patients
died and only 17 recovered well enough to be sent home. The others
remain in long-term care, Ms. Peterson said.
   Cocaine increases a patient's blood pressure, which Ms. Peterson
said probably causes the strokes. And with the arrival of the
stronger crack form of cocaine, the problem has gotten worse.
   Crack ``is a purer compound and gets into the bloodstream in
much higher quantities much faster,'' she said.
   ``I think we're going to see a heck of a lot more of this and
it's something we need to look at,'' she said. ``Most people don't
think cocaine when they see people coming in with a stroke.''

<HEAD>Students Demand Rehabilitation of Late Party Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Students put up posters at universities Sunday
demanding that Communist officials clear the name of Hu Yaobang, a
reformer who died two years after he was ejected as party chief.
   It was the first large-scale expression of campus discontent
with the government since the winter of 1986-87, when students
marched for democracy in protests that led to Hu's expulsion.
   The 73-year-old Hu died Saturday. He had suffered a heart attack
a week earlier during a meeting of the Politburo, the ruling body
that forced him out as party general secretary two years before. He
remained a Politburo member.
   Hu resigned after charges he failed to put down the nationwide
student marches. Hu was also accused of promoting dangerously high
growth rates through market-oriented reforms and pushing too hard
for Westernization.
   Dozens of posters went up Saturday and Sunday at Beijing
University, the country's leading institution, and at Qinghua and
the People's universities. Students also placed several wreaths at
a monument to China's revolutionary martyrs in central Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
   The posters praised Hu, obliquely criticized his opponents, and
called for his remains to lie in the mausoleum of legendary leader
and revolutionary hero Mao Tse-tung.
   ``Sincere men have died while hypocrites live on,'' declared one
poster without naming any official. ``Is there any hope left for
our country?''
   Several students at Beijing University and the People's
University said the aim of praising Hu was actually to criticize
those who helped expel him, including conservative party elders and
even senior leader Deng Xiaoping. Deng originally promoted Hu to
party chief but reportedly felt irritated afterward by Hu's
outspokenness.
   At Beijing University, security guards checked identification
papers of everyone entering campus and turned away students from
other schools in an apparent effort to prevent protests. However,
authorities left the posters up.
   Officials are especially intent on maintaining calm on campuses
in the weeks leading up to May 4, the anniversary of the day in
1919 when Beijing University's students began a campaign for
democratic reform in China.
   The campaign, which became known as the May Fourth Movement, was
a training ground for an entire generation of intellectuals,
including many famous writers, politicians and Marxist
revolutionaries.
   Beijing University students who gathered Sunday to mourn Hu
complained that China had made little progress toward reform since
1919.
   ``There is still no individual freedom,'' said one student,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   However, some students looked tense when asked if they would
again take to the streets to demand democracy. ``Maybe we can gain
democracy without marches,'' one said.
   Hundreds crowded around the posted sheets of pink, blue and
white paper covered with huge black characters demanding Hu's
rehabilitation.
   One poster signed by 18 people called for a ``public
clarification'' of Hu's forced resignation, a popular reevaluation
of his ``historical achievements,'' permission for activities to
mourn him, and placement of his remains in Mao's mausoleum.
   Many other students later added their signatures to show support.
   Another poster urged students to ``turn their grief to strength
and carry out democratization to the end.''
   A university lecturer watched the students and said on condition
of anonymity, ``This is good; it reflects what is in people's
hearts.''

<HEAD>Slain Spanish Envoy Veteran Of Lebanon's Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pedro Manuel de Aristegui, Spain's
ambassador to Lebanon who was killed by shellfire Sunday, was a
veteran of Lebanon's violence.
   ``If you're afraid of death, you should leave the country,'' he
said in a recent interview.
   The bearded 61-year-old envoy was kidnapped briefly in West
Beirut on Oct. 10, 1984, four months after he arrived in the
Lebanese capital.
   His abductors took him to the teeming southern slums of Beirut,
a stronghold of pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists, but they
released him three hours later after intensive contacts by the
government and security officials.
   De Aristegui was luckier than most of the foreigners kidnapped
by Moslem extremists in Lebanon. Others were killed and 15 still
are held hostage, most of them by Shiite extremists.
   On Sunday a 240mm howitzer shell blasted De Aristegui's
three-story villa in the Beirut suburb of Hadath, a Christian
sector, during one of the fiercest artillery and rocket battles of
the 14-year-old civil war.
   The shell exploded as the ambassador and his family were having
lunch, and De Aristegui was hit in the head by shrapnel. He died at
a hospital two hours later.
   His Lebanese wife, Jomana Awwad, was seriously wounded and his
3-year-old son, Diego Jr., suffered facial injuries.
   Also killed were De Aristegui's father-in-law, Lebanese poet
Tewfic Youssef Awwad; Awwad's other daughter, Samira, and a
Lebanese bodyguard.
   De Aristegui was the third Western ambassador killed in the
civil war.
   U.S. envoy Francis F. Meloy was killed by kidnappers in Moslem
west Beirut on June 16, 1976. French Ambassador Louis de Lamar was
shot dead by gunmen in the city's Moslem sector on Sept. 4, 1981.
   De Aristegui was born in the Basque town of Irun in Spain on
Oct. 17, 1927. After entering government service, he was secretary
at the Spanish Embassy in Venezuela and the consulate in San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
   He later was Spanish consul in New York and was assigned to
Spain's U.N. mission in May 1969. He also served as consul-general
in Hamburg, West Germany, and Cordoba, Argentina.
   In 1977, De Aristegui was named ambassador to Nicaragua and in
1980 he became governor of Spain's Basque province of Guipuzcoa. He
took the Beirut post four years later.

<HEAD>Tass Says Afghans Discover Evidence of Guerrilla Massacre</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tass news agency said Sunday that guerrillas
in Afghanistan shot civilians, including children, fleeing the
besieged city of Jalalabad.
   There was no independent confirmation of the report.
   Tass, quoting people it said were witnesses, said victims were
in a convoy of refugees from the city. It said the number of dead
and date of the alleged massacre were unknown.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, called the purported
attack a crime by opponents of Afghanistan's communist government
``akin to those perpetrated by the American military in Vietnam
against the peaceful Vietnamese population.''
   Tass said the convoy was carrying dozens of elderly people,
women and children from Jalalabad toward Kabul when the buses and
trucks were stopped by guerrillas. The anti-communist rebels
reportedly lined up the drivers, shot them, then set fire to the
vehicles, Tass said.
   ``Little children were seized and lifted by the hair; they were
shot and thrown into the Kabul River,'' Tass said. ``Pretty women
were led into the mountains, the rest were killed on the spot.''
   Tass said Afghan government troops discovered the burned buses
and trucks when they reopened the Jalalabad-Kabul highway, which
for two weeks was blocked by Moslem rebels.
   Blockades have been the guerrillas' primary tactic in their
fight to overthrow Afghanistan's communist government, which seized
power in a 1978 coup.
   On Feb. 15, the Soviet Union pulled the last of its troops out
of Afghanistan. Shortly thereafter, guerrillas set up a
government-in-exile in Pakistan and launched their attack on
Jalalabad, 70 miles from the capital.

<HEAD>FAA Overview Of Jetliners Flawed, Says Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration's system of
tracking malfunctions on commercial airliners is inconsistent and
rarely accomplishes its goal of predicting and preventing
accidents, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The report in The Seattle Times included analysis of more than
24,000 ``Service Difficulty Reports'' filed by U.S. passenger and
freight air carriers operating large jetliners during the past two
years.
   The newspaper found drastic inconsistencies in the reporting of
aircraft malfunctions and defects by the 17 largest passenger
airlines under an FAA program. The program's purpose is to
``promote aviation safety through analysis and detection of
mechanical reliability problems.''
   A Service Difficulty Report is a one-page document the FAA
requires airlines to file whenever an aircraft experiences
problems, ranging from cracks found during inspections to engine
shutdowns during flight.
   The FAA acknowledges problems with the SDR program and is
gearing up to overhaul it later this year.
   ``You're into a part of our data that, before you even started
analyzing it, somebody like me would've told you, `Don't spend a
lot of time with it because it's incomplete, inconsistent from
airline to airline, we have non-uniform reporting, we need to
review the items that are required to be reported, we have
timeliness problems,' and on and on and on,'' said Anthony
Broderick, the FAA's associate administrator for regulation and
certification.
   The FAA does not consider the service report system ``a critical
safety data base,'' Broderick said, but aviation experts say SDRs
can and should be an integral part of a warning system for
detecting and fixing airplane defects.
   Industry observers also say if the program were not so
haphazard, it might have prevented a corroded chunk of an Aloha 737
fuselage from ripping away in flight a year ago, or an apparently
mislatched cargo door from tearing a hole in the side of a United
747 two months ago. One person died in the Aloha Airlines mishap
and nine died in the United accident.
   ``There was information held by certain people within the
industry that could have prevented both of those accidents if the
information had been acted on properly beforehand instead of
afterward,'' said John O'Brien, engineering and safety director for
the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Lawmakers, passengers and industry experts, including the Air
Line Pilots Association, have been questioning the reliability of
the system that is supposed to make U.S. air travel safe.
   ``The way it stands now, there's absolutely no uniform
enforcement of criteria used to monitor these airplanes,'' said Dan
Labriola, a Seattle pilot, aeronautical engineer and aviation
consultant.
   One example of the lack of uniformity is that of the more than
24,000 reports checked by the newspaper, nearly 1,700 failed to
include the name of the airline submitting the report.
   In addition, dozens of reports omitted vital information, such
as what caused a malfunction or what the airline did to fix a
defect.
   The Times also reported that airlines have a great deal of
discretion in deciding when to file SDRs. Atlanta-based Delta
Airlines, for example, filed an average of 1.6 reports for each of
its 372 jets over the past two years, and St. Paul-based Northwest
Airlines, with 314 jets and comparable operations, filed 9.6
reports per jet in the same period.
   ``We do know that some airlines are more generous than others in
submitting things to us,'' said FAA spokeswoman Bobbie Mardis. ``We
do know that there are discrepancies.''
   The Air Line Pilots Association would like to see a
comprehensive SDR system put in place with consistent, detailed
reporting by the airlines made mandatory, O'Brien said.

<HEAD>Wreck Of Steamer That Went Down 91 Years Ago Believed Found</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The steamer Portland, which disappeared in a storm
91 years ago with as many as 200 passengers aboard, has been found
on the bottom of the Atlantic off the Massachusetts coast, an
oceanographer said Sunday.
   ``There's no doubt; we've got it,'' said John Fish of the
Historical Maritime Group of New England, who worked with Arnold
Carr and William McElroy for 13 years to solve the mystery of the
Portland.
   The old side-wheeler's hull was discovered Wednesday in 300 feet
of water east of Boston, Fish said, refusing to be more specific
about the location.
   ``The find is particularly significant, not only because the
Portland was one of the worst maritime disasters in the Northeast,
but because it remained shrouded in mystery,'' said Paul Johnston
of the Smithsonian Institution.
   Indications were that the hull was cut lengthwise when it went
down in 1898. ``We expected something weather-beaten,'' Fish said.
``We found something that appeared to have exploded.''
   The group will not salvage the wreck, Fish said. ``We're
considering it to be a memorial and we feel it's a grave where
between 150 and 200 people lost their lives,'' he said. There were
no survivors.
   The ship left Boston at 7 p.m. on the Saturday after
Thanksgiving, 1898, bound for Portland, Maine. The storm hit about
three hours later.
   By the time it ended, a total of 141 vessels and 456 lives had
been lost. Because of the missing side-wheeler, it came to be
called the Portland Storm. Bodies and flotsam from the ship washed
ashore on Cape Cod.
   The ship-hunters narrowed the search area by running the dates,
times and places where debris from the Portland washed ashore
through a computer program to trace it to its origin. The flotsam
included three victims' watches that stopped at 9 p.m., Fish said.
   The scientists then used sonar to find the wreck.
   The group wants to learn why the ship went down, and plans to
continue surveying the wreck with television cameras and
remote-control devices this spring and summer.

<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp said Sunday his
department will make illegal drug use or sales a specific violation
of public housing leases as a way to ease the eviction process for
local authorities.
   Kemp announced the step as he released a report describing
actions public housing authorities around the country are already
taking to solve drug-related problems.
   In a prepared statement, the secretary of Housing and Urban
Development said HUD would inform local housing authorities of ways
they can use already appropriated federal funds to make physical
and management improvements aimed at improving security against
drug crimes.
   He said HUD would publish a notice informing local housing
authorities that leases must include explicit provisions that allow
termination of the lease if any member of a household or person
under the tenant's control engages in drug-related criminal
activity.
   Although evictions that are instigated because of drug-related
activity are already possible, the process is often cumbersome
because there is no direct provision in a lease relating to drug
violations. Inclusion of such a clause would simplify and shorten
the process _ in much the same way it is easier to evict a tenant
for failure to meet specific rent obligations spelled out in a
lease than it is to evict an undesirable tenant on some more vague
ground, such as making too much noise.
   The HUD statement did not say whether a person had to be
convicted of drug-related criminal activity before being evicted.
HUD said public housing authorities, in reports to the federal
agency, generally said that when tenants are caught with drugs they
are evicted, but the housing authorities did not clarify whether a
conviction was required before eviction.
   In February, Kemp asked the managers of the some 3,000 public
housing authorities, which run federally subsidized public housing
projects, to report to him on how they are fighting drugs in the
projects.
   HUD said it had received responses from more than 1,000 housing
agencies so far. It said drug-related problems were reported by 70
percent of the medium and large public housing authorities
(managing 500 or more units) responding.
   One third of the small housing agencies reported drug problems.
   ``The responses I have received make it clear that law-abiding
residents in public housing want to be freed from the plague of
drug dealers and drug abusers, and the criminal activities they
create and spread,'' he said.
   Kemp last week proposed a series of steps for fighting drugs in
Washington, D.C., public housing projects and said he would
recommend them as well to all public housing agencies around the
nation.
   He suggested authorities put fences around projects, establish
guarded entrances, require photo identification cards of residents
and take other steps to increase security.
   He also said he would waive HUD requirements for hearings in
eviction cases, provided state laws accord tenants due process in
the courts. Dropping the HUD hearings was welcomed by some housing
authorities, but others said it would do little to speed up
evictions for drug-related crimes.
   Kemp said he would inform housing authorities that existing HUD
subsidies through its Comprehensive Improvement Assistance program
may be used for drug-related security such as lighting and other
means of securing areas. The money can also be used to improve
screening of prospective tenants, hiring staff to run drug
programs, and organization of neighborhood watch patrols, the
department said.

<HEAD>Report: Two SWAPO Guerrillas Killed, Six Captured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two guerrillas were killed Sunday in
fighting with South African-led security forces and six were
captured, a territorial official said.
   Gerhard Roux also said two more guerrillas of the South-West
Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, had turned themselves in at
U.N. assembly points. Altogether, only seven had arrived at the
U.N. posts to be taken to SWAPO bases in neighboring Angola.
   Roux is the spokesman for Louis Pienaar, the South
African-appointed administrator of Namibia, also known as
South-West Africa.
   April 1 was to have marked the beginning of Namibia's transition
to independence from South Africa, which has administered the
territory since World War II. But the transition was disrupted when
fighting broke out between the guerrillas and the territory's
security forces.
   According to an agreement reached a week ago between South
Africa, Cuba and Angola to end the fighting, the guerrillas are to
have safe passage to U.N. assembly points in northern Namibia.
   U.N. and local officials have expressed doubt that the
guerrillas would venture near the assembly points because of the
concentration of territorial police and soldiers in those areas.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said Sunday that any SWAPO
guerrillas captured by the territorial security forces should be
turned over immediately to U.N. forces in Namibia to oversee the
transition to independence.
   Roux said there had been no decision on how to deal with the 28
guerrillas captured by the security forces.
   He said that since April 1, 278 guerrillas and 27 members of the
security forces have been killed.
   Roux, in his report on Sunday's guerrilla deaths, said one
guerrilla was killed in a clash with territorial soldiers southeast
of Swartbooisdrift. The second was tracked and killed by police
near Okandjera, he said.
   He said the government forces suffered no casualties.
   There was no independent confirmation of Roux's reports.
Journalists are not permitted into the border areas, and
authorities have barred police and soldiers from talking with
reporters.
   SWAPO has been fighting against South African rule since 1966
and is expected to get the most votes in elections scheduled for
November.

<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people turned out Sunday to
launch a re-enactment of George Washington's carriage trip to his
inauguration, but the actor who played the nation's first president
was forced to leave by van.
   A sparkling antique carriage carrying the modern-day Washington
was less than 100 feet into the 250-mile trek from Mount Vernon to
New York City when it broke down. One of the wheels hit a fence
post and broke the main shaft connecting the harnesses and the
carriage.
   The shaky departure was the only hitch in opening festivities
celebrating the bicentennial of Washington's inauguration on April
30, 1789. The eight-day, 55-event trip will take the Washington
entourage to New York on April 23. A reenactment of the inaugural
ceremony is scheduled for April 30.
   Because of the tight schedule, Washington, played by actor
William Sommerfield, traveled the first five miles in the van
before switching to a back-up carriage that was hauled to a park
along the route.
   The Philadelphia actor stayed in character and was unperturbed.
   ``Strange vehicle, strange vehicle,'' Washington said of his
first automobile ride. ``In the war, the unexpected was the
expected.''
   Also speaking at the ceremony were former Chief Justice Warren
E. Burger, chairman of the Constitution Bicentennial Commission,
and Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank, who dedicated a new
25-cent stamp honoring Washington and the 200th anniversary of the
government's executive branch.
   Among the spectators were some who claimed to be Washington's
descendants. ``This is something very special for me,'' said
Josephine Thomas, 67, of Gulfstream, Fla.
   Sommerfield said he has spent 10 years studying Washington. At
age 58, he is a year older than Washington was when he made the
inaugural journey.
   The actor said he tries to show Washington's little-known
private side.
   ``He had both a private face and a public face,'' Sommerfield
said. ``And his private face was warm and human. He loved the
theater and would go two or three times a week. People said they
loved to sit by him because he had such a hearty laugh.''
   The first leg of the trip took Washington and two companions to
Alexandria. The trip this week will take them through the District
of Columbia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and into
New York City.

   The rarely rung bell of Liverpool's
Anglican cathedral tolled 94 times Sunday afternoon, once for each
of the soccer fans killed in the crush at British sport's worst
disaster.
   Thousands of fans of the Liverpool team walked hand in hand
around their home stadium at Anfield Road to honor their friends
killed Saturday at Sheffield's Hillsborough stadium.
   The soccer fans, most of whom were from Liverpool, were crushed
to death in the terraces, the standing-room area of the stadium,
minutes after the start of a semifinal cup game.
   Liverpudlians of all denominations filled the Roman Catholic
cathedral for a requiem Mass for the victims, and thousands
overflowed into the surrounding grounds.
   At the Anglican cathedral, bellringers took turns pulling the
rope of the church's master bell, Great George, which is rung for
the deaths of monarchs and tolled for the May 29, 1985 Heysel
soccer riots in Belgium when a stampede by Liverpool fans killed 39
fans.
   Scarves of Liverpool's colors, red and white, were tied all
along the iron entrance gate at Anfield Road, along with blue and
white scarves of the local rival Everton team. Bunches of flowers
covered the pavement below.
   Inside, a Salvation Army band played as the procession of fans
carried hundreds more wreaths and scarves to place on the terraces
behind the team's goal.
   Everton fans joined their Liverpool rivals and, standing side by
side, wept.
   The Liverpool team, four times European champion and a record 17
times English League winner, inspires lifelong devotion from its
fans and the rivalry with Everton is respectful and friendly.
   In many families, children grow up with split loyalties to
Liverpool and Everton.
   At every home match, the ``kop'' _ the bank of thousands of
fiercely loyal fans who stand behind one of the goals at Anfield
Road stadium _ is one of the most intimidating sights and sounds in
English soccer and the most famous group of standing fans in the
country.
   On Sunday, the kop was in mourning, shocked by the painful
deaths of fellow fans from the city whose name is synonymous with
soccer.

   Three Palestinians including a 10-year-old boy
were killed Sunday in clashes with soldiers as protests broke out
on the first anniversary of the slaying of a PLO military chief.
   In Jerusalem, leaders of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc balked at giving Cabinet approval to Shamir's
election plan for the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Despite army curfews in the occupied territories ordering
700,000 Palestinians to remain in their homes, more than a dozen
protests were reported Sunday over the death of Khalil Wazir in
Tunis last April 16. Israeli sources have said Israel's agents
carried out the slaying, but the government has never claimed
responsibility.
   In the West Bank city of Nablus, dozens of pictures of Wazir,
better known by his PLO codename, Abu Jihad, were plastered on
walls and utility poles.
   In downtown Tel Aviv, which is predominantly Jewish and rarely a
site of violence, assailants believed to be Palestinians set a gas
balloon ablaze at a pub entrance and painted graffiti calling on
Arabs to avenge Wazir's death, Israel television said.
   Ten-year-old Mohammed Suleiman Rabai was killed in the West Bank
village of Sumou when soldiers opened fire during a stone-throwing
demonstration to protest Wazir's killing, Arab reports said. The
army confirmed Rabai's death but said it was checking the
circumstances.
   Nasser Ibrahim Kasas, 17, died after he was shot in the back
during a demonstration over Wazir's death in the Dheishe refugee
camp outside Bethlehem, Arab hospital officials said.
   In the Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, soldiers shot and killed a
22-year-old Palestinian who attacked a soldier with a knife and
refused to stop when troops fired in the air, the army said.
   Arab reports gave the victim's name as Khalil Mustafa Al-Asstal.
The army said he was wanted by authorities.
   Six Palestinians also were wounded in clashes with soldiers,
Arab reports said. Military spokesmen confirmed at least two
injuries.
   The latest deaths brought to 435 the number of Palestinians
killed in the 16-month uprising against Israel's occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza. Eighteen Israelis also have died.
   Resistance to Shamir's election plan arose at a meeting of the
Israeli Cabinet during which the prime minister outlined his
proposal.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization has criticized Shamir's
proposal but made no official response.
   Despite reports beforehand that Shamir would name a special
Cabinet committee to pursue the election plan, a communique after
the meeting said only that ``consultations will now take place in
different government forums to promote the peace process.''
   Shamir's plan calls for electing Palestinians in the territories
to negotiate with Israel on a five-year period of autonomy. Talks
would be held in the third year on the final status of the
territories, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.
   Several Likud ministers reportedly expressed fears that the plan
would lead to the election of PLO supporters and to indirect
negotiations with the PLO through the United States.
   But Finance Minister Shimon Peres, head of the center-left Labor
Party, voiced strong support for elections and said Palestinians
must be allowed some form of political activity. Defense Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, also of Labor, told reporters he thought the
balloting would eventually be approved by the government.
   In Tunisia, PLO chief Yasser Arafat said Sunday he would accept
elections in the occupied territories under two conditions: that
they be held after the withdrawal of Israeli troops and under U.N.
supervision.
   ``Is there a single free man in the world who would accept
elections under the shadow of occupation?'' Arafat said in a
ceremony marking Wazir's death.
   In another development, a military court sentenced two army
entertainers to military prison terms for smoking hashish, Israel
radio reported.
   The three-member court in the Tel Aviv suburb of Jaffa, headed
by Col. Yoram Zelkovnik, sentenced one soldier to 15 days in prison
for smoking hashish and another to four months for smoking the drug
and supplying it to the group's commander.
   Members of the army's four entertainment troupes are regular
soldiers who perform at military bases and appear in musical
programs on Israel's state-run television.
   Also Sunday, police extended the detention of a free-lance
reporter for army radio on suspicion he fabricated a Palestinian
claim of responsibility for a hotel fire to inflame anti-Arab
sentiments, a police spokesman said.
   Meir Suissa, 26, of the southern resort city of Eilat, was
suspended from his job Friday pending the outcome of the case, army
radio commander Nachman Shai said. The fire occurred Friday at a
hotel in Eilat.

   Britain's Prince Edward on Sunday received bread

Orthodox church service.
   Edward, 25, the youngest child of Queen Elizabeth II, arrived in
Moscow on Saturday for a three-day visit.
   On Sunday morning, the prince visited an open-air museum at
Kolomenskoye outside Moscow.
   Prior to the service at the Church of the Holy Virgin of Kazan,
Archpriest Matvei Stadnyuk presented Edward with bread and salt. A
prayer was said for the British and Soviet peoples during the
service, and Edward later talked with Stadnyuk.
   ``I got the impression that the prince is a nice and unaffected
young man who has a good knowledge of the history of our people and
of the Russian Orthodox Church,'' the official Tass news agency
quoted the priest as saying.

<HEAD>Libya Denounces Report of Involvement in Pan Am Bombing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya on Sunday angrily denied a report in a British
newspaper linking it to the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   London's Sunday Telegraph, in a report attributed to U.S.
intelligence sources, said the bombing was conceived during a
meeting last year between Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi, a
radical Palestinian group and Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
   Libya's official JANA news agency, in a dispatch monitored in
Rome, said Libya ``has reaffirmed repeatedly its condemnation of
terrorism in general and the disaster suffered by the Pan Am jumbo
jet in particular, and the report published by this newspaper
amounts to no more than a part of the campaign of distortion and
twisting of facts conducted by Zionist and imperialist circles
hostile to Great Jamahiriya (Libya).''
   The Sunday Telegraph said the Palestinian group that
participated in the alleged meeting was the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command. The group, headed by Ahmed
Jibril, has been a prime suspect in the bombing.
   Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21, killing
270 people.
   The Sunday Telegraph said U.S. intelligence officers monitored
the meeting early last year in Libya and the participants discussed
the coordination of operations against U.S. targets.
   It said Libyan officials in Europe provided logistical support
for the bombing, which was planned and carried out by the
Palestinian group.
   It did not elaborate on the alleged participation of the
Revolutionary Guards, created by Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.

<TEXT>
   An off-duty Dallas police sergeant was
shot dead by police in this suburb early Sunday as he brandished a
gun and tried to enter his home after an argument with his wife,
authorities said.
   Police Sgt. Glenn Repp III repeatedly ordered Dallas Sgt. Larry
Wise to ``Drop it, Larry'' before both men opened fire at a range
of about 20 feet, said Duncanville police spokesman Dan Robertson.
   Wise, hit once in the chest, died about 50 minutes later at 4:05
a.m. at Charlton Methodist Hospital, Robertson said.
   Repp and his partner, Officer Stacy Holden, were not wounded.
   Wise, a 20-year police veteran, lived at the house with his
wife, Cindy, police said. The couple, who had once been separated,
had gotten into an argument at a nightclub earlier in the evening
while celebrating Mrs. Wise's birthday.
   Wise's sister-in-law, Brenda Smith, told police he made threats,
Robertson said.
   Ms. Smith, fearing for the safety of Wise's 13-year-old son and
a teen-age friend, went to pick up the youngsters, and asked police
to accompany her.
   Repp and Holden arrived at Wise's home just before he did,
Robertson said. Wise spotted the officers and pointed his gun at
them, then lowered it and headed for the door.
   The officers, who sought cover behind their car when Wise raised
his weapon, were approaching him when the shooting broke out.
   Robertson said police weren't sure who fired the first shot, but
Dallas police spokesman Hollis Edwards said Duncanville police told
him Wise fired first and Repp returned fire in self-defense.
   Ms. Smith and a male friend pulled up in time to see the
shooting, Robertson said.
   Mrs. Wise arrived afterwards, and took the teen-agers to a
neighbor's home, friends said.
   Carl Chapman, who lives across the street from the Wise home,
said Wise ``was a nice guy.'' Other neighbors, who asked not to be
identified, said they had never seen trouble between the couple.
   Repp, who knew Wise professionally, was put on a one-week leave.
   Robertson said the Duncanville and Dallas departments work
together daily, and said he hoped the shooting wouldn't change the
relationship between the two forces.
   ``We hope the (Dallas) officers can see our officers only did
what they had to do,'' he said.

   A fire broke out at the Jersey City
Medical Center early Sunday, leaving one patient dead and two
hospital employees suffering from smoke inhalation.
   The fire apparently started in the patient's 11th-floor room,
said fire Capt. James Pron. The blaze was reported at 2:52 a.m. and
declared under control about a half-hour later, he said.
   The cause of the fire remained under investigation, but
preliminary reports indicated it was accidental, said hospital
spokeswoman Sheila Paris Klein.
   The dead man was identified as George Velez, 31, of Jersey City,
which lies across the Hudson River from New York City.
   Velez, who was being treated for a variety of medical
complaints, died in his bed, the spokeswoman said. Autopsy results
were expected Monday.
   Hospital employees Ethel Morgan, 56, and Peter Samochowicz, 59,
were treated for smoke inhalation, officials said.
   About a dozen other patients on the 11th floor were moved to new
rooms, Ms. Klein said.

<TEXT>
   Spain's ambassador to Lebanon and at
least 17 other people were killed Sunday in fierce artillery
exchanges between Christians and an alliance of Syrian and Moslem
gunners, police said.
   Ambassador Pedro Manuel de Aristegui, 61, died while undergoing
surgery to remove shrapnel fragments that hit his head when an
artillery shell blasted his villa in the Christian suburb of Hadath
east of Beirut, police reported.
   Police said his Lebanese father-in-law, poet Tewfic Youssef
Awwad; and one of Awwad's daughters, Samia, and a Lebanese
bodyguard were killed when the shell exploded.
   The envoy's Lebanese wife, Jomana Awwad, was seriously wounded
and his 2-year-old son Diego suffered unspecified injuries, police
reported. Earlier reports said Ms. Awwad was killed.
   De Aristegui had served in Lebanon since June 1984. He was
kidnapped and briefly held shortly after he took up his Beirut
assignment and told an interviewer recently: ``If you're afraid of
death you should leave this country.''
   In Madrid, Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez
said Spain would not close its Beirut embassy. He said Spain has
``an international role of the first order'' in Lebanon.
   Police said at least 18 people died in the ferocious 18-hour
blitz that raged from dusk Saturday to mid-afternoon Sunday. They
said some 90 people were wounded.
   That raised the casualty toll from 40 days of fighting to at
least 235 killed and 847 wounded.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the duels were among the most intense in
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   He said at one point shells were ``falling like rain'' around
the hilltop presidential palace in the Christian suburb of Baabda,
where Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun lives, and the nearby
Defense Ministry in Yarze, his headquarters.
   Shells also exploded around the homes of the U.S., French and
Egyptian ambassadors in Christian east Beirut. No casualties were
reported.
   A Spanish Embassy official said de Aristegui was having lunch
with his family when their house was hit.
   Police said the shell was fired from a Syrian-controlled area in
west Beirut. They did not say who fired it, but Christian-run radio
stations said it was a Syrian artillery unit on a hill above the
capital.
   Aoun blamed the Syrian army.
   ``The assassination of the ambassador of a friendly state by a
Syrian artillery shell is an irrefutable testimony to the barbaric
nature of the Syrian occupation,'' Aoun declared in a statement.
   Police said state-run Radio Beirut in west Beirut's Hamra
district went off the air when Christian 155mm shells destroyed its
transmission aerial.
   The shellfire also started fires in the nine-floor Information
Ministry where the radio station is located.
   The ministry is next to the office of acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, head of the Moslem Cabinet vying for power with Aoun's
Christian Cabinet.
   Other Christian shells crashed close to the offices of The
Associated Press and United Press International news agencies, as
well as the French news agency Agence France Presse and the
London-based Reuters agency in west Beirut.
   The office of Italy's ANSA agency in the Moslem sector was
damaged by shrapnel. None of the staffers at the five wire services
was injured.
   Several Christian howitzer salvos exploded around Hoss' house in
the Aishe Bakkar district and near the state-run Channel-7
television station in the Moslem sector. Police said Hoss was not
hurt.
   The fighting has raged since March 8 between Aoun's forces,
estimated at 20,000 mostly Christian troops, and an alliance of
Syrian troops and militiamen of the Druse Progressive Socialist
Party.
   It erupted after Aoun blockaded militia-run harbors along
Lebanon's Mediterranean coast. The ports have cost the government
about $100 million a year in lost tax revenue, because the militias
levy customs duties on imports through the ports.
   The Druse militia retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave.
The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon's Moslem areas
under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeing mandate, joined them.
   Aoun's gunners on Sunday targeted Syrian positions near the
American University of Beirut in west Beirut, but there was no word
on Syrian casualties.
   The Murr Tower, an unfinished 40-story skyscraper near Beirut's
dividing Green Line, was another Christian target, police said. The
Syrians use the structure for artillery spotting.
   Three shells exploded around U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy's
residence but caused no damage or casualties, police said.
   Several rockets crashed overnight a few yards from the houses of
French Ambassador Paul Blanc and Egyptian Ambassador Hassan Shash
in the Christian suburb of Hazmieh, breaking windows, the police
spokesman said.

   A 30-year-old man held prisoner for five
months slipped out of his chains Sunday and fled his kidnappers,
the Italian news agency ANSA said.
   Ottavio Pronesti, a member of a landowning family in southern
Italy, was seized by a kidnapping gang in November while working on
his family's lands with a laborer.
   The abductors demanded a $3.7 million ransom, which the family
said it could not pay.
   Early Sunday, Pronesti freed himself from his chains, slipped
from the place he was held and walked for more than two hours
through the countryside before he reached a town a few miles from
his hometown, Melicucco, ANSA reported.
   He then called his family to pick him up, the news agency quoted
Pronesti's father, Michele, as saying.
   It said that more than 100 police were dispatched Sunday to try
to find the abductors. Police refused to comment on the case.

   The Roman Catholic church on
Sunday rejected accusations by the armed forces that its human
rights office is smearing the military and the right-wing party
that won elections last month.
   Reading from a church statement, Monsignor Gregorio Rosa Chavez
asked the armed forces ``to permit us to know the evidence behind
this reckless statement.''
   Last week the armed forces press office issued a communique
accusing the church's human rights office, Tutela Legal, of
sponsoring a smear campaign against the military and the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena.
   Rosa Chavea told worshipers at the Metropolitan Cathedral that
Tutela Legal ``operates only according to church criteria in its
labor of promoting and defending human rights _ criteria that are
invariable no matter what party is in the government.''
   Arena defeated the incumbent Christian Democrats in March 19
elections and President-elect Alfredo Cristiani is to take office
June 1.
   Arena's founder, retired army Maj. Roberto D'Aubuisson, has been
accused of having links with right-wing death squads that killed
hundreds of suspected leftists in the early 1980s. He has
repeatedly denied the allegations.
   Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary bishop of San Salvador, also
denounced attacks by left-wing guerrillas and security forces last
week in which he said 18 civilians were killed.
   He specifically criticized attacks on businesses by guerrillas
of the Faribundo Marti National Liberation Front, calling them ``as
condemnable as they are traditional.''
   According to both guerrilla and government reports rebels
attacked at least five factories, two shops, 12 bank offices and
two coffee processing plants over the past two weeks.
   Speaking with reporters after the church service, Rosa Chavez
blamed both the guerrillas and government forces for the civilian
deaths.
   Violence ``comes from all sides and it must be fought on all
sides,'' he said. ``The panorama is becoming rough, and for this
the new government will have a difficult task.''
   More than 70,000 people have been killed in the 9-year-old war
between the rebels and U.S.-supported government. Most of the
victims were civilians.

   People here are fed up with a fire that's
been smoldering in a pile of sawdust bigger than a football field _
after all, it hasn't stopped for two years.
   State fire investigator Jim Wallace said the state may have to
go to court to get the owner of the pile, Desert Mountain Forest
Products, to put out the blaze.
   ``You can negotiate and be a nice guy only so long,'' Wallace
said recently.``If it takes swearing out a warrant, we will.''
   When the wind blows, the hidden fire spouts sparks and smoke
like a volcano, neighbors say.
   Desert Mountain, which makes posts and sticks for California
vineyards, has accumulated a pile 100 yards long, 30 to 50 yards
wide and two stories high in places. The company lies just south of
Glacier National Park.
   Wallace said he suspects spontaneous combustion as the cause of
the fire, but the company's owners blame lightning.
   A similar blaze at a nearby mill wasn't extinguished until the
sawdust pile was bulldozed and clumps of burning material were
blasted apart with fire hoses, Wallace said.

<HEAD>Gallery Owners Assess Losses To Fire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A suspicious fire gutted a 104-year-old building
that housed several art galleries, destroying works valued at up to
$50 million, authorities said.
   The spectacular blaze Saturday left the six-story, block-square
building in ruins, with only a few walls standing.
   ``Oh my God,'' cried Roberta Lieberman, part-owner of one of the
eight galleries consumed in the blaze, when she saw the
destruction. ``It's devastating.''
   William van Straaten, whose van Straaten Gallery was among those
destroyed, estimated the combined loss at $50 million.
   Battalion Chief Harold Corrigan said the blaze began in four
sections of the building, leading fire officials to suspect arson.
Flames were seen coming from opposite sides of the structure, and
construction workers who fled the building reported fire on the
upper stories and in the basement.
   Fire Department spokesman Tom Sheppard blamed the severity of
the blaze on contractors who disconnected systems designed to bring
firefighting water into the building. He noted that firefighters
were called to the building on Thursday for a fire that took an
hour to put out.
   ``This wouldn't have happened if they hadn't cut corners,' he
said. ``It's so foolish, now they have nothing.''
   A sprinkler system in the building did not work and fire doors
were open in the building, which was being rehabilitated by the
owners, Mesirow Realty Management Inc., into a mixture of
residential lofts, galleries and shops, officials said.
   Gerald Levin, president of the real estate division of Mesirow,
said Saturday the contractor had done good work on the building.
   ``My understanding was that there (were hookups for) water in
the building,'' Levin said. ``Our design has been at every stage
approved and inspected by the ... Fire Department.''
   The fire occurred one day after a Cook County Circuit judge
refused van Straaten's request to halt construction in the building
because of an alleged fire hazard.
   Circuit Judge David Shields said he issued an order prohibiting
work around van Straaten's gallery but allowing work in the rest of
the building.
   ``The fact that there were incidents in the past didn't lead me
to conclude that there were going to be incidents in the future,''
Shields said.
   The fire ``couldn't have come at a worse time for those
dealers,'' said Leslie Hindman, owner of a gallery four blocks from
the building.
   She said dealers were preparing for Art Expo, an annual spring
event at Chicago's Navy Pier.``For a lot of galleries, that is
tantamount to the Christmas shopping season,'' Ms. Hindman said.
   ``It's one of the most important art fairs in the world and most
of those dealers do a good part of their business during the show.''
   The building, erected in 1885, became the linchpin of the
burgeoning art scene in the city's River North area in recent years.
   The eight galleries dealt mostly with modern American artists,
and buyers from around the world came to buy works, officials said.

   More than half of the members of Iran's

reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, reported that 166 members
of the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, said in a letter to
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini that articles concerning the future
leadership of the country and the powers of the executive branch
must be changed.
   The move came as revolutionary hardliners led by Interior
Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi appeared to tighten their control of
Iran's leadership.
   It is believed the letter reflects an effort by Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the speaker of parliament, to counter the hardliners by
strengthening the power of the presidency.
   The letter urged Khomeini, Iran's 88-year-old spiritual leader,
to create a commission to redraft the constitution. Proposed
amendments would be put before the nation in a referendum, the
letter said.
   Rafsanjani, once considered the most powerful figure in Iran
after Khomeini, wants to eliminate the post of prime minister, now
held by hardliner Hussein Musavi, and give the presidency more
executive powers.
   He has said he will run for the presidency in elections expected
in August, when the second four-year term of President Ali Khamenei
expires. The constitution bans Khamenei from running for a third
term.
   One indication that the hardliners are threatening Rafsanjani's
power came last month when Khomeini appointed Hojatoleslam Abdallah
Nouri as his personal representative within the Revolutionary
Guards.
   Khomeini named Rafsanjani acting commander-in-chief of the
military forces last June, but Nouri will outrank all commanders.
   Also last month, Khomeini's designated successor, Ayatollah
Hussein-Ali Montazeri, was dismissed and two key figures in the
Foreign Ministry resigned during the furor caused by Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Khomeini said the novel blasphemed Islam and called on Moslems
to kill Rushdie. The action led to a diplomatic confrontation with
the West and disputes among Iranian officials.
   Montazeri had questioned the achievements of the Islamic
revolution since it toppled the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in
1979, and had called for more freedom and a halt to the executions
of dissidents.

   A winery worker accused of brutally
murdering seven people, including his wife and two daughters, was
depicted by those who knew him as a simple, smiling man who adored
his wife _ too much.
   ``He never caused any problems for anybody,'' said Warren
Brunhagen, a regular at McNeilly's bar in Boyes Hot Springs, where
winery worker Ramon Salcido, 28, was a regular customer.
   Authorities on Sunday continued the nationwide hunt for Salcido
that began Friday when authorities discovered the bodies of his
24-year-old wife, Angela, at their Boyes Hot Springs home; his
mother-in-law and her two young daughters at their home in Cotati;
and a co-worker at the Grand Cru Winery.
   Salcido's three daughters were found with their throats cut
Saturday at a dump between Petaluma and Sonoma. One lived, and was
recovering at Petaluma Valley Hospital on Sunday.
   Salcido, a Mexican native, behaved well and smiled often, but
was ``overly possessive'' of his wife, said John McNeilly, owner of
the tavern about 15 miles from where Salcido worked.
   ``What I saw was not jealousy,'' he recalled. ``He always had
his hands on her and he'd never leave her by herself.''
   Richard Clark, Salcido's next-door neighbor and friend, has said
Salcido was intensely jealous, and often drove home several times a
day to spy on her.
   Clark said he once heard Mrs. Salcido, an aspiring model, cry
out, ``Living with you is like living in jail. You won't let me go
out.''
   The couple recently began arguing loudly, Clark said.
   `I could hear them yelling. ... I guess I knew (the murders)
were coming,'' he said. ``I heard him say, `I'm going to blow your
head off.'''
   Mrs. Salcido's modeling career was just beginning to take off,
Clark said.
   Salcido ``was really jealous,'' the neighbor said. ``Anybody who
was higher up than him or if he had a nicer car than he did _ he
didn't like that. He wanted to be No. 1.''
   Salcido also was upset recently because he was served papers
ordering him to pay nearly $6,000 dollars in overdue child support
and make monthly payments of $511 for a 4-year-old daughter in
Fresno, Clark said.
   In addition, Salcido was having increasing problems at the Grand
Cru winery, where he often failed to show up for his job as a
forklift operator and would call in sick when he wasn't.
   Salcido's in-laws ``bent over backwards for this guy,'' Clark
said. ``They gave him money for his apartment and still he didn't
like them. He didn't appreciate nothing.''
   Meanwhile, many residents of this picturesque region tried to
cope with the mass slayings by treating it as an isolated incident.
   In Santa Rosa, the area's biggest city with a population of
about 103,000, residents were alarmed by the killings and followed
news reports closely, but few said they felt vulnerable enough to
change plans or take unusual safety precautions while Salcido was
still at large.
   ``People aren't going to go in their houses and hide because of
it,'' said Martin Coletti, 33. ``It heightens your sensitivity to
violent crime, the worst crime, and maybe Santa Rosa is becoming
more vulnerable to that.''
   Several downtown merchants reported normal business Friday and
Saturday night. Strollers frequently pointed out that Salcido's
rage appeared to have been aimed only at family members and
acquaintances.
   ``It seems like it's a family situation,'' said Gary Lee, 49.
``I don't think he's out to hurt normal people.''
   Still, Sonoma County Sheriff's Deputy Dan Ramseier said worried
residents were calling at the rate of two or three an hour.
   ``You name it, they're worried about it. They're worried about
everything,'' he said. To reassure callers, Ramseier said he urged
residents to avoid strangers, report suspicious vehicles in the
neighborhood and keep a close eye on children.

   Lawmakers Sunday demanded changes in
stadium designs, including a ban on anti-riot fences, after a mad
rush at a soccer match trapped thousands of fans behind one of the
steel barriers. At least 94 people died.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited Hillsborough stadium
and promised a public inquiry into Saturday's disaster, which
turned a soccer cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest into a nightmare.
   The investigation was expected to focus on why so many fans were
still outside as the match began and on allegations that many
entered the sold-out stadium, which has a capacity of 54,000,
without tickets or with forged tickets.
   In Liverpool, the Roman Catholic cathedral was filled to
overflowing for a requiem Mass for the victims _ most of them from
the northwest port city. The Anglican cathedral's bell tolled 94
times to mark the deaths.
   Survivors broke down in tears as they described watching
children die and people hit each other in the frenzied fight to
survive Britain's worst sports disaster.
   Steve Ellis, a photographer, said he could hear and see children
screaming as they were pressed into the fence.
   ``More were coming in from the back, pushing forward. ... I can
still see the young lads behind the fence shouting, `Save me!' I'll
never forget it until the day I die,'' he said.
   Seventeen-year-old Wayne Adams said he was about five rows from
the front of the crowd. ``I realized it was serious when I saw one
of the lasses standing near me just turn blue in the face. She went
down. She was dead. That was it,'' he said.
   Police defended the decision to open 16-foot-wide steel gates
outside the stadium just as the match began. Last-minute arrivals
then poured into a central standing-room-only section, pressing
those already inside against the steel mesh fence.
   The sturdy 10-foot-high fence, angled in at the top to stop
people from scaling it, prevented them from escaping over the top
to the field. Some were crushed to death. Others suffocated or were
trampled trying to fight their way out of the crowd or when the
barrier finally collapsed.
   South Yorkshire's chief constable, Peter Wright, said a senior
officer decided to open the gates ``to save people's lives and to
relieve the crush outside.''
   Survivor Stephen Dooling, 34, defended the action. ``The police
had to open the door because the lads at the front were screaming.
They would have died there at the turnstiles instead of in the
ground,'' Dooling said from his hospital bed.
   Outside the stadium, people lay flowers and team scarves in
memory of the dead.
   Many victims were teen-agers and children, because the cheap
standing-room-only section is favored by young fans.
   Pratt said 170 people were injured. Seventy-one people were
hospitalized, many in extremely critical condition.
   It was the third major soccer tragedy in four years involving
English teams, which have been barred from European soccer
competition since a May 1985 rampage by Liverpool fans at Heysel
stadium in Brussels that killed 39 people.
   Eighteen days earlier, 56 soccer fans had died in a fire at
Bradford stadium in England.
   Lawmakers, sports officials and survivors demanded changes in
stadium designs and elimination of anti-riot fences and
standing-room sections, known as terraces.
   In the terraces, fans pay about $6.80 and stand on bare concrete
ledges that ascend from the edge of the field to about 10 feet
above ground level. To watch the game, they must peer through the
steel mesh fence.
   ``People were caged in yesterday _ people who should have been
able to escape off those terraces, who were killed needlessly,''
said Liverpool Liberal lawmaker David Alton.
   He said the fences should come down immediately, a demand echoed
by Sheffield Labor lawmaker Joe Ashton, and Denis Howell, a former
Labor sports minister.
   Bert Millichip, president of the English Football Association,
said regulations require fences, in part to prevent rowdiness.
   Andy Williams, spokesman for the English Football League, told
reporters, ``Some of the measures we took to combat hooliganism may
now have turned on us.''
   All of Liverpool's remaining games this season were suspended
``for the time being,'' team chairman John Smith said.
   Officials of the international soccer federation, FIFA, and the
European counterpart, the Union of European Football Associations,
said that standing-room sections should be abolished. Officials
said it wasn't that easy.
   ``Clubs have tried to change the way fans watch matches by
eliminating terraces and making their stadiums all-seating. But the
public in England demands the right to stand,'' said Jill Smith, an
administrator for the English Football Association.
   She said Coventry, one of the nation's biggest clubs, was the
latest to try to eliminate standing sections.
   ``People wound up standing on the seats,'' she said. ``It's a
very traditional thing, a terribly emotive issue.''
   In Amsterdam, meanwhile, soccer fans smashed store windows,
hurled bricks at police and fought with rival spectators Sunday,
and 27 people were injured and 24 arrested, police said.
   The violence occurred before and after a match between the Ajax
team of Amsterdam and a team from Rotterdam.

   Police are investigating links between
the cult gang responsible for at least 13 ritual killings on the
U.S.-Mexico border and several slayings in Mexico City, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   Police and residents said the gang maintained a high-security
safe house in this suburb of the capital, drove luxury cars and
planted a garden to spruce up the neighborhood.
   On Friday, police raided the suburban house and two apartments
in downtown Mexico City, four days after police in Matamoros, 550
miles to the north, found 13 bodies buried on a ranch.
   On Sunday evening, authorities discovered two more bodies buried
on a collective farm two miles south of the ranch. Investigators
said it was possible the victims were killed by the same cult but
it was too early to be sure.
   The government newspaper El Nacional said the Mexico City
killings took place in the past two years, but it did not say how
many people died. Police have asked the attorney general's office,
which is responsible for Mexico's anti-narcotics efforts, to assist
in the investigation, it said.
   ``We are investigating everything but don't have any results
yet,'' Alejandro Dominguez, a duty officer at the attorney
general's office, told The Associated Press.
   Officials said the group trafficked in drugs and believed the
human sacrifice would protect them from police. Four men have been
arrested; police in Mexico and the United States are seeking
alleged ringleader Adolfo Constanzo and three others.
   The house that Federal Judicial Police say belonged to Constanzo
is surrounded by 10-foot walls in a middle class neighborhood 13
miles northwest of the center of Mexico City. Neighbors said
Saturday that four to six young men had been living there about
four months.
   ``They left suddenly'' on April 10, said Rosa Musa. ``I saw them
carrying boxes out into the cars, and then they all went away.''
   The house was guarded by five closed-circuit television cameras
and a radar-controlled spotlight system that lit up the street
whenever a car drove by at night. A pockmarked pistol target sat in
the garage.
   Police guarding the house said that inside they found two marble
altars.
   ``It makes you feel creepy,'' said one officer, who identified
himself only as Rene.
   In Matamoros, authorities found altars covered with black
chicken feathers, burned turtles, cigars and other occult
offerings. The bodies had been mutilated, some with their hearts or
brains ripped out.
   In Mexico City, police sealed off a condominium thought to
belong to alleged Constanzo associate Omar Ochoa and a building
where another alleged associate, Martin Quintana, reportedly lived.
Ochoa and Quintana are fugitives.
   Luis Mazon, a resident of Quintana's building, said Ochoa,
Quintana and Constanzo had moved out of Quintana's apartment about
eight months ago after a dispute with the building's owner.
   ``You can't believe the gossip and the terror in the building
right now,'' Mazon said.
   He said he had heard that Constanzo dabbled in the occult,
reading cards and conducting ``limpias,'' or removal of spells.
``But it was the normal type of witchcraft we have here in Mexico,
nothing satanic.''
   Neighbors in Mexico City and Atizapan said the young men drove
expensive cars. They said the men had many visitors but seldom
spoke to neighbors.

   Authorities arrested more than a dozen people
during a weekend anti-drug sweep that netted the alleged leadership
of a group that controlled much of the cocaine market in the
nation's capital.
   Among those arrested were Rayful Edmond Jr., 24, and Tony Lewis,
described as being in his mid-twenties. Officials said the two led
a network that controlled up to 20 percent of the cocaine and crack
traffic in Washington.
   The Washington Post said 16 were arrested, while other reports
put the number as high as 25. Police did not release an official
figure.
   ``It was a successful operation and it is still continuing,''
assistant district police chief Max J. Krupo told the Post on
Sunday. Among those arrested were nine of Edmond's relatives, the
paper said.
   The Post quoted sources as saying the pair's alleged drug
network employed more than 150 people and has been linked to scores
of homicides. Edmond and Lewis were arrested Saturday on cocaine
distribution charges and were scheduled for arraignment on Monday.
   The arrests resulted from a two-year joint investigation
conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and
district police. Officials said more information would be released
after seals on federal documents were lifted.
   The drug cartel reportedly imported as much as 440 pounds of
cocaine into the district a week. The Post quoted sources as saying
that more than a year ago Edmond's alleged drug gang was generating
income of more than $300,000 a day.
   District Mayor Marion Barry said Sunday the arrests would put
``a mini-dent'' in the local supply of drugs. However, he predicted
that in the long run, ``one of the lieutenants who know the
business will move up and keep things going.''

   State and federal officials examined
Exxon's plan to clean hundreds of miles of shoreline as an
environmentally risky steam-cleaning method was tested Sunday on
rocks blackened by America's worst oil spill.
   Oil from the 10.1 million-gallon spill, mostly in the form of
tar balls and mousse-like foam, threatened Homer and other ports on
fish-rich Cook Inlet.
   Boats from Kodiak, the nation's No. 1 fishing port, were forced
to avoid part of a herring grounds closed late Saturday due to oil
nearby.
   State wildlife biologist Dave Prokopowich said he believed no
potentially tainted fish were taken in the closed area, at the
northern tip of the Kodiak Islands.
   ``They (fishermen) seemed to have stayed away from those areas
where they feared there might be contamination,'' Prokopowich said.
   With winds mainly from the south, there was no sign of oil
advancing toward Kodiak and rich crab waters nearby, said Coast
Guard Lt. Jim Madden.
   Homer residents complained of delays in placing log booms they
have built to protect their town. Exxon officials say the booms are
being stockpiled at nearby Port Graham to make them easier to
deploy when the oil strikes.
   ``People here in Homer are being jerked around,'' said Lee
McCabe, a resident who was building booms. ``If the fishermen in
this town fished like Exxon deploys boom, you'd never see a fish on
the dock.''
   Exxon-paid workers tested cleanup methods on blackened rocks at
Block Island, including high-pressure, hot-water sprayers. The
company has about 200 of the sprayers, but they have not been used
previously with salt water.
   Adm. Paul Yost, the Coast Guard commandant sent by President
Bush to hasten the operations, watched the steaming streams of
water blast ankle-deep muck from a beach about 20 miles from where
the Exxon Valdez ran aground.
   Cold-water techniques, even those using high pressure, have
little impact on microorganisms and small marine life. But the jets
of high-pressure steam upend rocks, strip away sand and gravel and
kill beach life. Scientists say it takes up to two years for life
to return to the sterilized shore.
   Yost, however, said he believes the steam method is the only one
that can cleanse the sound's shoreline.
   The admiral also said the logistics of keeping enough equipment
and workers on the beaches of Prince William Sound during the brief
summer would be enormous. Asked if the task could be completed by
September, when Alaska begins bracing for winter, he said, ``I
don't know. It's going to be very, very tough.''
   Yost said he was unlikely to make public Exxon's shore cleanup
plan, which he received Saturday. He said it was the company's
plan, and it was up to Exxon whether to release it ``and let
everybody in the U.S. second-guess them.''
   ``It appears to be a piece of work that's well thought out,
scientifically and operationally, and I'm very encouraged,'' Yost
said, adding that he and his advisers would meet Monday with Exxon
officials in Valdez.
   He said that it might take three weeks to get Exxon's cleanup
plan completely under way.
   ``I wish it was two or three weeks ago,'' said Dennis Kelso,
Alaska's environmental chief.
   Kelso, who has accused Exxon of dragging its feet after the
wreck of the Exxon Valdez on March 24, indicated he would
scrutinize the plan over the weekend and brief Gov. Steve Cowper on
it before discussing it in public.
   Exxon spokesman Don Cornett said the company would not discuss
its plan until after Yost had fully reviewed it.
   Efforts to contain the oil at sea have been largely ineffective.
Exxon, the Coast Guard and the oil pipeline consortium Alyeska all
have been accused of moving too slowly in the face of a staggering
logistical task.
   Elsewhere Saturday, state wildlife and environmental officials
in a Coast Guard helicopter searched the coast of remote Katmai
National Park, but were unable to confirm National Park Service
reports of oil on shore, said Coast Guard Lt. Jim Madden.
   Even if no oil washes up, rangers fear the tainted carcasses of
sea mammals and birds killed by the spill will be eaten by bears
foraging on the beach.
   About 3,000 rocky beaches were tainted by oil in Prince William
Sound. The 44 beaches targeted by the state for immediate cleanup
have at least 240 miles of often rugged shoreline.

   Spain's ambassador to Lebanon and at
least 16 other people were killed Sunday in fierce artillery
exchanges between Christians and an alliance of Syrian and Moslem
gunners, police said.
   Ambassador Pedro Manuel de Aristegui, 61, died while undergoing
surgery to remove shrapnel fragments that hit his head when an
artillery shell blasted his villa in the christian suburb of Hadath
east of Beirut, police reported.
   Police said his Lebanese father-in-law, poet Tewfic Youssef
Awwad; and Awwad's other daughter, Samia, were killed when the
shell exploded.
   The envoy's Lebanese wife, Jomana Awwad, was seriously wounded
and his 2-year-old son Diego suffered unspecified injuries, police
reported. Earlier reports said Ms. Awwad was killed. De Aristegui's
1-year-old daughter, Alexandra, escaped unhurt.

   Hispanic and black women, women with low
incomes, those living with someone they are not married to, and
those in school are statistically more likely to undergo abortions
than women in general, according to a private survey.
   Firm statistics are not available on the number of abortions
performed each year nor on who has them. Moreover, the survey by
The Alan Guttmacher Institute confirms that most abortions are
performed on white, middle-class women because they make up the
bulk of the population of women of childbearing age.
   However, the extensive survey by the New York-based, non-profit
group that studies reproductive issues suggests that women in
various categories have a statistically disproportionate share of
abortions relative to their raw numbers.
   For example, it found that nonwhite women make up 16.7 percent
of the childbearing-age population, but accounted for 31.4 percent
of the abortions.

   Frustrated by federal inaction, at least a dozen states are
debating bills that would force companies to provide health
insurance to the millions of workers who earn too little to afford
coverage and too much to be eligible for Medicaid.
   The 24 million members of working families are at the center of
a growing legislative battle between hospitals seeking to cut
billions of dollars in losses and small businesses that say they
are unable to insure their employees.
   The war over the uninsured working poor has been fought and lost
in Congress, and was renewed again last week by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.
   ``It is time to make health care a basic right for all, not just
an expensive privilege for the few,'' Kennedy said as he and Rep.
Henry Waxman, D-Calif., introduced legislation that would require
employers to buy health insurance for all full-time employees.
Similar legislation failed last year.

   The Exxon oil spill in Alaska has focused new
attention on a tough question for shapers of America's energy
future: how much environmental risk will the public accept to
continue refilling the nation's oil cupboard?
   Few would argue for shutting down the existing oil production in
Alaska, but environmentalists are using the March 24 spill in
Prince William Sound to press their view that U.S. energy needs
don't justify an all-out push for new oil development, most of
which would take place in environmentally sensitive areas.
   ``If we want to prospect for oil we should do it in Detroit,''
said Scott Denman, director of the Safe Energy Communication
Council.
   He said the Reagan administration's decision to relax the auto
mileage improvement schedule set by the Congress in 1978 has cost
the nation the equivalent of about 3 billion barrels of oil _ as

   House Speaker Jim Wright, along with other
players in the political drama unfolding around him, readied
themselves Sunday for the formal curtain raising of a long-awaited
ethics committee report on his finances.
   Wright, who launched his public defense with a long presentation
Thursday that was beamed via live television into millions of
homes, remained out of public view Sunday.
   But his chief understudy _ House Majority Leader Tom Foley, the
man who would succeed him should Wright be forced to step down _
was on a live television interview show trying to keep the waters
calm.
   Republican Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota, meanwhile, was
characterizing the pending ethics committee report as raising much
more substantive questions than the kind of technical violations
that he acknowledged would not be enough to force a House speaker
to descend from the powerful position.

   A legal struggle to decide who is
the wife of the slain hero-ecologist Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes
could thwart efforts of international filmmakers to make a movie of
his life.
   Eunice Feitosa de Menezes, who claims to be Mendes' first and
only legal wife, has asked a court in Acre, his home state, to
confirm her marital status so she can contest any film rights
allotted the recognized widow, Ilzamar Mendes.
   Mendes, 44, a rubber tappers union leader who fought to save the
Amazon from deforestation, was killed by the son of a cattle
rancher Dec. 22 outside his modest wooden house in Xapuri, 2,666
miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Mendes had won a United Nations award for his struggle against
Amazon ranchers wanting to clear the rain forests for grazing.
   Hollywood producers, seeing dramatic value in a story about a
confrontation between powerful Amazon landowners and humble rubber
tree tappers, have been turning up in Brazil to see about shooting
a movie about Mendes, regarded by many as the world's first
environmental martyr.
   Gilson Pescador, a member of the Chico Mendes Foundation, said
offers have come from Robert Redford, representing 20th Century
Fox, from United Artists, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Inc.,
Ted Turner from Atlanta, and a number of British and Brazilian film
companies.
   For the moment, the decision on who will get the authorized film
rights, along with cooperation from Mendes' Brazilian colleagues,
lies with a four-member panel from the foundation, an organization
made up of ecologists, rubber tappers and Mendes' family members.
   But panel members are concerned that a court battle pitting
Eunice Menezes against Ilzamar Mendes could discourage film
producers and scuttle the project, said Pescador.
   He and other foundation members say Menezes and her lawyer are
backed by the right-wing Rural Democratic Union, a powerful group
of landowners that rubber tappers and local Roman Catholic leaders
allege took part in the Mendes shooting.
   ``This is an underhanded attempt by the Rural Union to descredit
Chico and demoralize our movement to save the forest,'' Pescador
said in an interview. ``The Rural Union fears the movie will make
Chico an even greater hero than he is now.''
   The Rural Union denies the accusations.
   Also at stake is the money the project would bring to the rubber
tappers, estimated at more than $300,000, Pescador said.
   ``We need economic resources to continue our work,'' he added.
``The movement is in a delicate stage after Chico's death, and our
opponents know it.''
   The Rural Union, which spent millions of dollars in a successful
lobby effort to water down land reform clauses in Brazil's new
constitution, says it doesn't oppose a Chico Mendes movie.
   ``If the film shows what really happened with dignity and is
backed up with official evidence presented in court, we would
welcome such a production,'' Roosevelt dos Santos, president of the
Rural Union, said by telephone from Brasilia, the capital.
   But Mary Helena Alegretti, a member of the Mendes Foundation
panel, charged that the landowners' group had sought out Menezes
and her daughter with other motives.
   ``The Rural Union is trying to show the world that Chico wasn't
such a good, innocent boy after all,'' she said.
   ``All I know is that I was married to Chico,'' Ilzamar Mendes
told The Associated Press, maintaining that she married him in Acre
in 1983.
   But Menezes' lawyer, Norival Valadao, who has defended Rural
Union cattle ranchers in numerous cases against squatters,
ecologists and the rubber tappers, said Mendes never divorced
Menezes, thus invalidating his marriage to Ilzamar.
   Valadao said he had the certificate from Mendes' church wedding
to Menezes, the baptism certificate of his first child by Menezes,
and the index of a town hall register documenting the marriage.
   ``The page listing Mendes' wedding was torn out,'' he said.
``But I still have enough evidence to serve justice and annul his
second marriage.''
   Pescador said, ``There is not one document proving that this
woman was married to Chico.'' But he conceded that Menezes was the
mother of Mendes' 20-year-old daughter, Angela Maria.
   Alegretti said Angela Maria would be considered a Mendes family
member when it came time to divide the family's share of film
rights.
   Ilzamar Mendes, her two children and Mendes' brother and sisters
would receive 15 percent of the royalties. Another 15 percent would
be donated to the rubber tappers union and other such organizations
in Acre. The remainder would go to education and health projects
for Indians and rubber tappers throughout the Amazon, Alegretti
said.
   ``No one here is trying to get rich on these projects,'' she
said. ``We're doing it to get Chico's message out. That's what he
would have wanted.''
