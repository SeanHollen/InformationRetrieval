<HEAD>Uno Heads for Summit; Plans Debt Reduction and Environmental Aid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno left Wednesday for the
economic summit in Paris, where he will pledge more than $65 billion
in debt relief and environmental aid for developing nations, a
government official said.
   A Finance Ministry official said much of the assistance would be
in the form of loans, some with easy terms.
   The official, who spoke on conditin of anonymity, said the aid
would be offered because the economic difficulties of some
developing nations are so great.
   The loans would be designed to help debt-ridden countries
restructure old loans as a way to reduce debt payments. The approach
reflects support for U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's
Third World debt reduction plan.
   The Finance Ministry official said $500 million would be set
aside for projects to protect the environment.
   The three-day summit of major industrialized democracies begins
on Friday. Before the start, Uno is to meet with officials from the
other participating nations _ Britain, Canada, France, Italy, West
Germany and the United States _ according to a Foreign Ministry
release.
   On Thursday, he will attend events in Paris to celebrate the
200th anniversary of the French Revolution and the grand opening of
the new Bastille Opera House.
   Uno is accompanied on the trip by his wife, Chiyo, Finance
Minister Tatsuo Murayama and Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka. He
is to return home Tuesday.

   Voters in this Denver suburb on
Tuesday recalled their mayor and four City Council members in a flap
that began when a TV crew filmed the police and fire chiefs drinking
on the job.
   ``The mayor condoned the activity,'' said recall organizer Verna
Cook. ``As far as the council is concerned, I certainly think that
their inaction has caused his to happen and they should be
recalled.''
   Voters cast 801 ballots to recall Mayor Lester Bauer, 81, and 361
to retain him, said City Clerk Peggy French. Mark Stickel was
elected his successor with 433 votes.
   Four of the council's six members were recalled: Mildred Early,
Bob Hamilton, Grace Diamond and Mayor Pro Tem Ernest Shelton, French
said. They were replaced by Richard Wright, Robert Snell, Linda Dunn
and Al Pfluger. Council incumbents Wayne Martin and Early Headly
held onto their seats.
   Cook herself ran for mayor to unseat Bauer, who in November
survived another recall vote she spearheaded over skunk removal.
   Tuesday's recall election stemmed from a series of reports on
Denver's KUSA-TV in April in which Police Chief Dwain Farris and
Fire Chief Jim Fyffe were filmed drinking at bars while on duty on
several afternoons.
   The City Council initially asked for Farris' resignation and
suspended Fyffe for 30 days without pay. But an angry crowd at a
City Council meeting the next night persuaded the council to fire
both men.
   Cook said that the council knew about the men's alleged drinking
problems before the televised reports but did nothing about them.
She then organized the recall drive against Bauer and the four
council members ousted Tuesday.
   Shelton, who was targeted in the recall, started a recall effort
of his own against Martin and Headly, who survived Tuesday's
election.
   Bauer said of Cook's second recall campaign: ``She has that right
and that's her prerogative. That's twice that they've tried it. But
I think she'll have a big job on her hands to recall the entire
council.''
   French had said she expected good turnout among the 4,500
registered voters, but turnout was light. Fifteen candidates vied
for seven seats. Voters decided first whether to recall the
incumbents and then who should replace them.
   In the recall election in November, ballots were counted three
times before it was determined that Bauer had kept his job by one
vote, 896-895.
   That recall was launched after a resident was cited for shooting
a skunk. Bauer opponents rallied around the resident, saying the
city had stopped paying for removal of stray animals.

<HEAD>Auction `Fever' Boosts Fine Art Prices</HEAD>

   Fine art prices are going, going, gonzo this
auction season, soaring through the ceiling when the gavel comes
down. But even as the art market booms, some experts fear the
picture may not stay so pretty.
   ``A lot of people are being taken in by this sort of fever,''
said George Goldner, a curator and top buyer at the J. Paul Getty
Museum, the nation's richest. ``The longer it goes on, the more it
resembles a bubble that one day will burst.''
   For now, the inflation is inescapable, as even Goldner will
attest: He paid $32.5 million for a 16th century painting last
month, more than tripling the record for an Old Master at auction.
And all that glitters is not Goldner's:
   _ Records were set for more than three dozen modern, post-modern
and impressionist painters at sales in May, including $47.9 million
for a Picasso self-portrait _ an 800 percent increase from its 1981
price. Only one painting has done better, a Van Gogh that drew $53.9
million in 1987.
   _ An 18 century American bookcase desk sold in May for $12.1
million, quadrupling the record for a piece of furniture. The
reported buyer was neither museum nor gallery, but a Texas
financier, Robert M. Bass.
   _ A Catskill Mountains landscape sold for $8.25 million, tops for
an old American painting. A Frederic Remington bronze brought $4.4
million, a new height for American sculpture. ``The Birds of
America'' etchings by John James Audubon sold for $3.96 million, an
increase of $2 million in less than two years.
   Such prices are reflected in thousands of lesser sales, rippling
through the art world in a delicious shudder, at least for sellers.
Sotheby's auction house, the world's biggest, gaveled off $1.8
billion in goods last year, up by $400 million from 1987. And this
year is far bigger.
   ``It's awesome. It's mind-boggling,'' said Milton Esterow,
publisher of ARTNews magazine. ``Art has become an international
currency. The market has exploded. It's a revolution, a renaissance,
like we've never seen before.''
   But the glee is not universal. Art experts say the soaring sums
are pricing many museums out of the market, leaving them unable to
expand or upgrade their collections. Some say auction hype has
falsely inflated some prices.
   ```It's simple and easy: Buy something and you'll get rich.' This
is the message of the auction rooms,'' said Goldner. ``It's the
wrong message and people eventually are going to get hurt by it.
There will be a day when the market will shake out, and bad modern
paintings won't be worth what people are paying for them today.''
   The reason for art's price explosion is simple: Because of
worldwide economic good times, many people have much more money. As
some of that cash migrated to art, prices rose _ drawing finer art
to the market and raising prices even higher. And 1986 federal tax
changes limited the benefits of donating art to museums, putting
even more works on the market.
   Additionally, said Harvey Katz, an art market analyst for the
investment firm Salomon Brothers Inc., the auction houses have
improved their marketing techniques. Catalogs are less intimidating,
major works are sent on tour before sales, bidding is simpler and
telephone bids are accepted.
   ``As the auction houses have become more accessible, they've
captured more and more business,'' said Katz. One result: Christie's
auction house is rumored as a takeover target. And Sotheby's is
splitting its stock, two for one.
   But Goldner said auction house promotions can misrepresent the
value of some pieces, particularly costly modern art. And he called
Sotheby's practice of lending money to buyers a dangerous trend that
inflates the market and increases the perception of art as a
speculative commodity.
   John Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America, maintained that
buyers still are primarily collectors drawn to certain works, not
investors seeking profit. And he said marketing, ultimately, does
not create sales.
   ``What weapons do we use to get people into bidding? They do
spend real money,'' Marion said. Sotheby's willingness to loan
buyers some of that money, he added, is no different from a bank's
loan to a home buyer.
   Another concern is the art boom's effect on public museums, many
of which are finding themselves unable to afford major purchases or
pressed to sell some works to private buyers, which removes the art
from public view.
   Such was the case for the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, a
modern art gallery that sold the $8.25 million Catskill landscape,
by Frederic Edwin Church, to finance purchases of modern works. The
painting was on loan to the Minneapolis Institute of Art, which had
it on display. A dealer bought it.
   ``This was an issue we wrestled with long and hard,'' said Erwin
Kelen,a board member of the Walker and its acquisitions committee
chairman. ``Is it our responsibility to keep a 19th century painting
on public view, even if not in our institution? Or to maximize
acquisitions for our own collection?''
   While the latter concern prevailed, Kelen said, the painting
likely will outlive its new owners and be returned to a museum.
Goldner, however, said he feared the growing concept of art as a
commodity would work against that outcome.
   ``The sad fact is that a lot of people who call themseves
collectors today are investors,'' he said. ``And instead of giving
their collections toward the end of their life to a museum to put on
display, they see their apotheosis as being a successful sale at
Sotheby's.''
   Marion, for his part, is looking forward to Sotheby's greatest
sale yet: An estate auction next fall that includes 44 paintings
valued at $1 million or more each, including a Van Gogh, a Picasso
and nine Monets. The total take should easily exceed $100 million.
   ``The fall,'' he said, ``looks to be very, very strong.''

<HEAD>A Decade After Skylab, Another Satellite May Fall</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ten years after Skylab created fear
and fascination with its fiery plunge from orbit, NASA is racing to
retrieve another giant satellite _ this one as big as a bus _ before
it falls to Earth.
   The satellite is being pushed by solar pressure and tugged by
Earth's gravity toward a predicted crash through the atmosphere in
January.
   Experts say as many as 100 one-pound chunks of debris could
survive the blazing reentry and reach the Earth, with a remote
possibility of people getting hurt.
   Not many Americans are in danger because the satellite, LDEF, for
Long Duration Exposure Facility, passes over only Hawaii, South
Florida and the southern tip of Texas. Nor are Western Europeans,
Soviets or most Chinese threatened.
   LDEF's path covers all territory between 28.5 degrees north and
28.5 degrees south of the equator _ mainly water, but also most of
Africa, South America, India, Southeast Asia and Australia.
   To try to save the satellite and its cargo of experiments, NASA
plans to launch the space shuttle Columbia and a crew of five Dec.
18 to pull in the errant satellite with the shuttle's 60-foot robot
arm, stow it in the spacecraft's cargo bay and take it home.
   The main reason for retrieving the satellite is not to save
lives, because officials feel the danger is slight. Rather, they
want the spacecraft back to find out what has happened to it and its
experiment during nearly six years in space.
   The information is of interest to engineers designing NASA's
permanent space station Freedom and to scientists of the Strategic
Defense Intiative, who envision a network of orbiting ``Star Wars''
missile defense satellites that must endure long exposure to the
same elements that have battered LDEF for years.
   ``Everything on it is of extreme interest,'' said William H.
Kinard, the LDEF project's chief scientist at NASA's Langley
Research Center. ``Have the strength properties changed, do the
mechanical systems still work? What about the hinges, motors,
latches, lubrications, data systems?
   ``We have no communications with the spacecraft. We have to get
it back,'' he said.
   If predictions are wrong or if solar flare activity increases in
the coming months, LDEF could reenter the atmosphere and break up
before the shuttle can get there.
   ``It will be close, but it looks like we'll be OK with a December
launch,'' said Kinard.
   If LDEF does reenter, it isn't expected to be the sensation that
Skylab was when it dashed through the atmosphere on July 11, 1979,
raining debris into the Indian Ocean and on remote areas of
Australia.
   Skylab was much bigger, at 77.5 tons and 118 feet long. About 26
tons survived the fierce reentry heat, and thousands of pieces, some
up to two tons, hit water and land along a path 3,600 miles long and
100 miles wide. No one was hurt and no damage was done.
   LDEF is 30 feet long and 14 feet in diameter and weighs 10.7 tons.
   Skylab, which had been home to three astronaut crews during six
years in orbit, received considerable attention because it flew over
a large area of the globe, including most of Europe, all of the
continental United States, southern Canada and much of the Soviet
Union and China.
   For months before the space lab fell, the world received daily
predictions on when it might come down. It was the largest machine
man had ever put into space, and there was great uncertainty over
just how much would survive and how many injuries or deaths and how
much damage the debris might cause.
   Computer calculations gradually narrowed the predicted reentry to
sometime in July. But the exact day was forecast only two days
before and the exact hour just hours before.
   Final projections were off by several minutes, and NASA's
forecast of an Indian Ocean landing proved wrong when residents of
western Australia watched flaming debris fall from the sky.
   LDEF was placed in orbit in April 1984 by the space shuttle
Challenger. It was to have been retrieved 10 months later by another
shuttle crew, but delays in the launch schedule and the 1986
Challenger explosion postponed the effort for years.
   Planners thought they had plenty of time to get the satellite,
with some scientists forecasting it could stay aloft until 1991. But
increased sunspot activity has caused Earth's atmosphere to expand,
pushing denser air to higher elevations. That has resulted in more
drag on the satellite, slowing it down and pushing it closer to the
ground, where gravity has a stronger tug.
   LDEF has descended from its original 288-mile-high orbital path
to about 250 miles. Kinard said the forecast is that by mid-January
it will be at about 167 miles, the point where it will begin to
tumble out of control and break up.
   The spacecraft carries 57 experiments intended to determine how a
wide range of materials are affected by constant bombardment from
micrometeoroids, radiation, manmade space debris and other items in
space.
   There also are 13 million tomato seeds aboard, which are to be
distributed to students around the country who are to plant them in
tests for growing food on long space voyages.

   The $3 billion Christian publishing business
doesn't thrive on the Good Book alone.
   The 350 exhibitors at Monday's convention of the Christian
Booksellers Association offered everything from T-shirts and
videotapes to jigsaw puzzles and computerized Bible programs.
   One sale item was a baseball cap bearing the message, ``REPENT!''
   ``They're showing the spiritual warfare between the powers of
Satan and Christianity, and showing that Christ is supreme ... but
in novel form,'' said Bob Hawkins Jr., vice president for marketing
for Harvest House Publishers.
   The $3 billion industry has grown by leaps and bounds during the
last decade, said William R. Anderson, president of the association.
``What was basically just a mom-and-pop industry only a few years
ago, now is a serious worldwide industry.''
   Book publishers are not limiting themselves to the standard
religion shelf items. Available now from Christian-oriented
publishers are cookbooks, exercise manuals, financial guides and
novels, all with a spiritual bent.
   And exhibitor Adeeb Howrani said a lot of people are wearing the
good word on their chests.
   ``People will spend $18 or $20 for a Nike T-shirt,'' he said.
``It's not unreasonable to ask $12.95 for a T-shirt that expresses a
positive message.''
   Howrani, who was wearing a shirt reading, ``Signed, Sealed,
Delivered, I'm Yours Lord,'' said he does not incorporate any
secular images on his products.
   ``There's so much in the Bible, it's almost ridiculous to take an
idea from somewhere else,'' he said.
   Dave Bordon, sales manager for Infinity Video of Tulsa, Okla.,
said his company is offering tapes such as ``Idol Busters,'' a
take-off of the ``Ghostbusters'' movies, to capture the teen-age
audience.

   State District Judge Allan McGuane's
verdict is in on the basic black of the bench: It's boring.
   After 13 years as a judge, he has taken to spicing up his
wardrobe with red and gray robes.
   Now, he's considering green and maybe some pastels.
   ``It's just to put a little color in my life,'' McGuane said
Monday. ``Be a little different. There's a real monotony to everyone
wearing black.''
   There's no rule that a judge must wear black. It's just a
tradition, he said. ``And you should see what some of them wear
underneath their robes to express their individuality.''
   ``Some lawyers think they look good, others think I am out of my
gourd,'' McGuane said.
   McGuane doesn't know how judges came to wear black. One story is
that Oliver Wendell Holmes began the tradition among American
jurists after their British counterparts donned black as a mark of
mourning for Queen Victoria.
   ``I don't know why,'' McGuane said. ``She wasn't our queen.''
   Lawyers have been trying to figure out whether there is any
correlation between McGuane's mood and the color of his robes. Will
he look kindly on their clients when he is wrapped in rosy red?
   ``There really isn't, but it keeps them busy and out of
mischief,'' McGuane said.
   McGuane said the final arbiter of his garb is Assistant
Clerk-Magistrate Margaret Palmeri.
   ``She won't let me go into the courtroom wearing something that
clashes with what's she's wearing,'' McGuane said. ``She's the color
coordinator.''

<TEXT>
   France is readying a display of sparkle, power,
culture and whimsy for this week's climax of the French Revolution
bicentennial.
   The focus will be on an assembly of nearly 30 world leaders, on
spectacular parades and fireworks, and on the inauguration of a new
Opera house at the Place de la Bastille, where a mob stormed the
hated Bastille prison on July 14, 1789, to launch the revolution.
   Among the chiefs of state on hand will be President Bush, for the
annual economic summit of the world's seven largest industrial
democracies. By chance, this year is France's turn to be host.
   The result, depending on the point of view, is expected to be the
City of Light at its most enchanting _ or a security-imposed
gridlock on a scale the developed world has never seen.
   It will either be a fitting tribute to one of the founding events
of the modern age, or an exercise in self-congratulation that
ignores both the cruel and brutal side of the Revolution and the
plight of today's poor and oppressed.
   Bicentennial celebrations and commemorations have been in full
swing all year, but the big weekend gets started Thursday, when
President Francois Mitterrand has all his out-of-town guests _ Bush
and the other leaders of the rich countries, but also the leaders of
Bangladesh, Mali, India and Egypt and other countries _ over for
lunch.
   Later on, when the economic summit gets moving, the leaders of
the poor and middle-income countries wind up relegated to a
second-class itinerary _ dinner with Premier Michel Rocard, and the
like _ which reportedly has even Mitterrand's Socialist supporters
uneasy.
   A ``counterbicentennial'' demonstration and concert last weekend,
on the theme that the commemoration should have more to do with the
Third World and less with solemn ceremonies and fancy dinners, drew
an estimated 100,000 people to the Place de la Bastille.
   Apparently Mitterrand's original plan was to mount an encounter
between leaders representing all continents, and rich and poor
countries, but he was unable to win support for the idea from his
summit partners.
   With all the dignitaries dashing about town, Paris will see its
most stringent security ever, including a dirigible looking down
from above, and what are expected to be epochal traffic jams.
   Police say expressways and city streets will be shut without
warning when motorcades of the 30 leaders are about to pass. A chunk
of central Paris is already a no-parking zone and will be off-limits
to ordinary vehicles for three days.
   Thursday night, Bush and the other leaders get a taste of culture
at the inaugural performance in the high-tech Opera house that
Mitterrand has ordered built at the Bastille, just across a busy
square from where the prison once stood.
   The new building, at the gate of the newly upgraded eastern
section of the city, is supposed to bring opera to the people, but
news of its construction has been overshadowed by controversy over
its program.
   Conductor Daniel Barenboim was fired in January over what the
government said were his elitist views and high salary. It took
until May to get a new musical director, and regular performances
will not start until next year.
   Friday is Bastille Day, featuring two severely contrasting
parades on the Champs-Elysees. The traditional military display,
with missiles, tanks, helicopters and fighter planes, makes its
deafening way down the avenue in the morning.
   Later that night, a much-anticipated spectacle choreographed by
the bad boy of French advertising, Jean-Paul Goude, portraying the
ideals of the revolution through twists on national stereotypes.
   ``They are cliches, but I'm trying to be positive with the
cliches,'' Goude said Monday.
   The images range from Britons parading in artificial rain, to
Russians dancing with a bear on ice, to Africans on live zebras to
the Florida A&amp;M University marching band strutting backward all the
way down the avenue.
   ``It's Michael Jackson's Moonwalk,'' Goude said. ``I asked them
if they could do the `Moonwalk' from the Etoile to Concorde and they
said, `No problem.' Very American. They're doing a salute to James
Brown.''
   The summit itself, with chief items on the agenda expected to be
the debt crisis and global environmental action, begins Friday under
the new pyramid entrance to the Louvre museum, which is closed for
three days to give way to the leaders of France, Britain, Italy,
Canada, Japan, West Germany and the United States.
   Most of the meetings, however, will be in the just-finished
cube-shaped arch in the La Defense complex on the capital's western
edge.
   If everyone is not exhausted by Saturday night, they are invited
to watch the city's annual fireworks display near the Eiffel Tower,
wrapping up the bicentennial celebrations with some of the flash and
spark that started it all in July 1789.

<HEAD>Andreotti Begins His Effort To Form New Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti has begun his
effort to become the premier of Italy for a sixth time.
   He received the mandate to try to form Italy's 49th postwar
government from President Francesco Cossiga on Sunday and met Monday
with caretaker Premier Ciriaco De Mita.
   Andreotti was expected to begin his consultations with various
party leaders today.
   The president turned to Andreotti, who like De Mita belongs to
the dominant Christian Democrats, after De Mita said last week that
he could not revive the five-party coalition he led for 13 months
until resigning May 19.
   De Mita's government collapsed following criticism of his
leadership from the Socialists, the second largest party after the
Christian Democrats in the governing coalition.
   Italian newspapers have reported that Socialist leader Bettino
Craxi, who blocked De Mita's effort to revive his coalition, has
pledged not to oppose Andreotti.
   Andreotti said he would work to revive the five party coalition _
Christian Democrats, Socialists, and the small Republican, Liberal
and Social Democrat parties _ which has governed in recent years.
   He predicted the negotiations to form a new government would be
delayed by preparations for the annual meeting of the seven major
industrialized nations, to be held in Paris this weekend.
   Andreotti served as premier twice in 1972-73 and three times
successively in 1976-79.

   ``Black, Brown and Beige,'' played by an 18-piece All-Star Jazz
Orchestra conducted by Maurice Peress, sounded most impressive.
   Because of some familiarity with it and with later extended,
symphonic compositions by Ellington, the 1989 audience probably
appreciated it more than its first hearers.
   ``Black, Brown and Beige'' begins with ``Work Song'' and ``Come
Sunday.'' Frank Wess played ``Come Sunday'' on a saxophone Johnny
Hodges used to use. Words to ``Come Sunday'' came later. The only
singing in ``Black, Brown and Beige'' is ``The Blues,'' sung
originally by Betty Roche and Monday by the impressive Melodee
Savage.
   Peress said Ellington wrote a 30-page narrative about a mythical
character going from slavery to Harlem which included the lyrics to
``The Blues.'' Peress said the composer switched from his original
intent, opera, to the instrumental ``Black, Brown and Beige.''
   Ellington's introduction to each of the piece's three parts was
recorded and played to Monday's audience. Ellington didn't fully
explain his intentions, always assuming that his audience was
knowledgeable, but his introduction was instructive.
   Concerts were longer in 1943 than today. The first half also
included musical portraits of three black entertainers and the
seven-minute ``Black and Tan Fantasy.'' After that, Ellington surely
introduced the saxophone, trumpet and trombone soloists; it wasn't
done on Monday.
   The second half had a number of ``concertos'' _ pieces about five
minutes long that Ellington composed as solos for certain players,
accompanied by the band. Milt Hinton played ``Jack the Bear,''
written for Jimmy Blanton, who died before the 1943 concert. Tenor
saxophonist Bill Easley played Ben Webster's part on ``Cotton Tail.''
   Jon Faddis made his trumpet speak in ``Boy Meets Horn,'' a piece
that's evocative. Faddis was as impressive there as he was in
numbers calling for him to be fast and flashy. Sir Roland Hanna
played piano. Miss Savage's hard swinging of ``Rose of the Rio
Grande,'' which Ellington didn't write, was so good that Peress had
her repeat it.
   The series of concertos lacked a needed spark of excitement that
Ellington's stage style undoubtedly added in the original concert.
The evening ended beautifully with Hinton, clarinettist Jimmy
Hamilton, who played in the Ellington Band for 26 years, Faddis and
trombonist Dave Bargeron in front of the band, blending on ``Mood
Indigo.''

   Hardee's Restaurant said it will refit
tiny ``Ghostblasters'' toys in the wake of numerous reports of
children swallowing the batteries.
   About 2 million of the cigarette lighter-size, noise-generating
toys, have been sold at $1.79 each since they were offered at the
beginning of July, said John Merritt, vice president of public
affairs for Hardee's, based in Rocky Mount, N.C.
   The remaining 2 million in inventory will be altered by hand, he
said Monday.
   ``Little 6-year-old Johnny, which this toy is designed for,
leaves it lying around and his little brother gets it open and eats
the battery,'' Merritt said.
   ``The retrofitting will cost us $1 million, but that is a small
price to pay for public safety.''
   The toys are a tie-in with the ``Ghostbusters II'' movie and were
being distributed by more than 3,100 Hardee's outlets, Merritt said.
   Reports that some children had swallowed the tiny batteries began
coming in almost immediately, Merritt said.
   The Capital Poison Control Center hotline at Georgetown
University Hospital in Washington, D.C., received 19 calls during 10
days about children between 1 and 3 years old swallowing the
batteries, said Dr. Toby Litovitz, the center's medical director.

   A benefit concert for the Boys and Girls
Clubs had special meaning for Alan Paul of the pop group The
Manhattan Transfer, who got a start thanks to the organization.
   The Boys Club of Newark provided him a college scholarship,
private singing lessons and emotional encouragement, said Paul, a
club trustee.
   ``They always let me sing at parties and other functions,'' said
Paul. ``That helped my self-esteem and made me believe in myself and
my talent.''
   The benefit Monday at Newark Symphony Hall featured The Manhattan
Transfer, the four-member a cappella group; Take Six, the
Grammy-winning gospel group; and singer Dionne Warwick, an East
Orange native.
   Paul said Ms. Warwick, a family friend, took him to his first
recording studio when he was 14 years old.

   Gov. Mario Cuomo traded ethnic
jokes with radio-television talk show host Larry King, and the
leader of a Jewish organization said the exchange was in poor taste
but not offensive.
   ``Let me ask you about the Italian people,'' King said to the son
of an Italian immigrant during an interview Monday. ``You say the
wrong thing, they punch you. In the army, they surrender.''
   ``The Jewish people wouldn't serve,'' shot back Cuomo. ``They
were conscientious objectors because of the wage rates.''
   King, who is Jewish, was interviewing Cuomo as part of the annual
convention of the New York State Broadcasters Association.
   Henry Siegman, executive director of the American Jewish
Congress, said the exchange might have been ``in bad taste, but I
don't think either one of them ... intended to be insensitive or
offensive.''
   Siegman likened the jokes to comedy routines performed by Jewish
comedian Jackie Mason ``on Broadway.''

   A concert promised to bring together six legends
of rock 'n' roll. But two legends did not show up and two others
gave less-than-legendary performances.
   Jerry Lee Lewis and Fats Domino withdrew at the last minute
because of illness from Sunday's show at Toronto's Sky Dome, and
Canadian rockabilly star Ronnie Hawkins filled in.
   The show went on, but not without its flaws. Fans booed Chuck
Berry, who refused to allow his performance to be shown on the
stadium's huge TV screen.
   The 35,000 fans watched 60-year-old rocker Bo Diddley re-string
his signature box-shaped guitar after snapping one in the middle of
an aimless, lackluster performance.
   The bright spot was Little Richard, who tore through hits such as
``Lucille,'' ``Tutti Frutti'' and ``Good Golly Miss Molly.'' Frankie
Valli, formerly of the Four Seasons, also performed.
   Lewis, whose explosive career as the would-be king of rock is
portrayed by actor Dennis Quaid in the movie ``Great Balls of
Fire,'' blacked out Saturday at his rural Mississippi home.
   Lewis also canceled a Saturday night show at the Bonnie Castle
hotel in Alexandria Bay, in upstate New York.
   Lewis, 53, was seen by a doctor and diagnosed with intestinal
flu, said his manager, Don Dortch.
   Saturday was the opening date of a tour Lewis planned to coincide
with the movie's opening last week.
   Lewis, writer of ``Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On,'' ``Breathless''
and other tunes, has no other concert dates scheduled until July 21,
when he is to perform in France, Dortch said.

   Real estate tycoon Donald Trump is rumored to
be the silent partner in a bid by New York Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner to build a convention center hotel here.
   Steinbrenner told a city review committee he was working with
Tampa businessman Ron Moore and a renowned big-name backer, whom he
did not identify but is said to be Trump, the Tampa Tribune reported
Monday.
   Trump and Steinbrenner are longtime friends. Steinbrenner
persuaded Trump last summer to speak at a Tampa fund-raising dinner.
   Steinbrenner is proposing a $78 million project that includes a
610-room hotel for the $137 million waterfront convention center in
downtown Tampa.
   William Graulich and Associates Inc., a New Jersey-based hotel
builder, made a separate bid to build a 600-room hotel.
   A third plan, a $109 million venture of Radice Corp. of Fort
Lauderdale, Major Realty Corp. of Orlando and Stoneridge Resources
Inc. of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., called for an 800-room hotel in two
16-story towers with a marina.
   The committee is scheduled to recommend a hotel developer to the
City Council by July 20.

   Viscount Althorp, the younger brother of Princess
Diana and one of Britain's most eligible bachelors, said that after
a six-week romance he has decided to marry a former model.
   The 25-year-old viscount, a roving correspondent for America's
NBC-TV, said his fiance, 24-year-old Victoria Lockwood, had worked
as a model in New York and Paris and studied acting in London.
   Althorp said Monday he was taken aback by the speed of events in
the the brief affair. But he said he decided quite quickly that he
wanted to marry Miss Lockwood, and was now completely happy.
   The wedding is planned for autumn.
   The viscount, who uses the name Charles Althorp professionally,
is a godson of Queen Elizabeth II and heir to the earldom now held
by his father, Earl Spencer, and the family seat, Althorp House, in
Northamptonshire.
   Miss Lockwood lives with her parents in a Victorian row house
overlooking the River Thames in southwest London.
   Earl Spencer said that Diana, the Princess of Wales, had met
Victoria and fully approved of the wedding.

<HEAD>Congress Was Repeatedly Warned of Problems at HUD</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress, now rushing to investigate
allegations of Reagan-era abuses at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, was warned repeatedly in the past decade that lax
management left the agency ripe for graft.
   ``We had too many fires and we just had one fire department,''
Rep. Barney Frank said Monday on why Congress did little in response
to the warnings.
   Problems at HUD were outlined in dozens of reports by the
agency's inspector general and the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress.
   ``Congressional staffs just aren't big enough and members of
Congress just don't have enough time,'' said Frank, D-Mass., a
member of two committees that oversee HUD programs. ``These people
at HUD just didn't care about the programs so we had to spend most
of our time just trying to keep the programs from being destroyed.''
   Many of the statements found in the reports now seem prophetic,
warning of problems now under congressional scrutiny, including
influence-peddling, poorly targeted programs and millions of dollars
in missing funds.
   ``Project selections had been based upon political consideration
rather than merit,'' the GAO's John H. Luke told Congress in October
1984, at one of the few hearings held to explore problems at HUD.
Luke was testifying about revised loan policies for housing for the
elderly and handicapped.
   The changes, he said, ``reduced accountability and in turn limits
the department's ability to explain and defend its decisions.''
   New HUD Secretary Jack Kemp last week suspended one of the
department's elderly housing programs because 30 percent of the
projects had resulted in foreclosures. Many of the projects had low
occupancy rates, which an internal audit blamed on HUD for approving
large developments despite warnings the area housing market would
not support them.
   In January 1984, three years into the Reagan administration, the
GAO criticized the management style of then-HUD Secretary Samuel
Pierce in a report to Congress. The report said Pierce delegated
most decision-making and did not establish a centralized management
process to keep track of his deputies.
   Congress now is investigating allegations that political
influence played a role in major HUD project awards and that
political appointees often overruled career agency officials in
awarding HUD funds.
   A high turnover rate among the agency's brass also weakened HUD
management, the GAO warned.
   Many of those now facing congressional scrutiny are former HUD
officials who became private real estate developers or consultants _
and profited in their new jobs by winning HUD work.
   The GAO management study also said HUD had trouble tracking its
money because most of its accounting was done by hand. Most of the
systems that had been automated were obsolete, the report said.
   HUD's inspector general audited private escrow agents hired by
the agency to handle sales and acquisitions of property, and found
the agents often were late paying HUD its money _ and in some cases
did not pay at all. The agency didn't know about most of the lapses
because of poor accounting, the audits said.
   Testimony to a House subcommittee investigating HUD has indicated
that many major decisions were made by Pierce's top aide, Deborah
Gore Dean, who had no previous experience in housing but had
considerable contacts with influential Republicans.
   Congress also is investigating the awarding of HUD money to
projects that, while qualified, were not ranked as priority programs.
   ``We found that some applications with low project points were
funded,'' the GAO said in a March 1985 report that reviewed the
selection process used to award HUD's coveted Urban Development
Action Grants.
   Another report sent to Congress in April 1988 said surplus funds
received by public housing agencies were used to pay for office
furniture, softball uniforms, birthday cards, holiday parties and
exercise equipment.
   One such agency, GAO said, used $76,000 to buy equipment and pay
travel expenses for a drum and bugle corps to represent the agency
at parades and other festivities.
   The GAO said the HUD official in charge of the program was aware
some of the funds were not spent on housing but opposed efforts to
establish guidelines on how the money could be spent.

<TEXT>
   A bottlenose dolphin that died after
swimming up the East and Hudson rivers was infected by a parasite
that apparently affected its sense of direction, an autopsy revealed.
   The dolphin, which attracted the interest of marine experts and
the public for three weeks, was an 8-foot, 600-pound female that had
given birth to at least 12 calves in more than 30 years in the
Atlantic Ocean, biologists said Monday.
   ``As far as dolphins go, I think she had a pretty good life. It
was a long one, anyway,'' said Samuel Sadove, a marine biologist who
conducted the autopsy. Sadove, director of the Okeanos Ocean
Research Foundation, said dolphins have been known to live 37 years.
   The ultimate cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage. The body
was found Sunday in the Hudson.
   There was no immediate indication that pollution or any toxic
chemicals contributed to the death, Sadove said, but he added that
further tissue tests were planned.
   The dolphin was first noticed June 20 in the East River, between
Manhattan and Long Island. It stayed in the river for about 11 days,
then headed into the Hudson and upriver two weeks ago. It was
sighted as far north as Kingston, more than 80 miles upriver from
New York Harbor.
   The dolphin had been infected two or three months ago by a worm
ingested with infected food, Sadove said. The parasite lodged in the
sinuses, causing a disease called nasitroma, which is common in
marine mammals, he said.
   The parasite invaded the brain, possibly affecting the animal's
sense of direction and environment, Sadove said.
   In addition, there were signs of severe stress from being in
fresh water, but returning the animal to the sea would not have
saved it, Sadove said.

   Installing President Bush's choice to head the
government nuclear weapons program would be like ``putting the Joker
in charge of Gotham City,'' an environmental group says.
   Victor Stello Jr. lacks commitment to improving safety at the
decrepit weapons facilities, Greenpeace and other environmental
groups said Monday.
   Stello's selection runs counter to Bush's professed desire to
restore public confidence in the weapons complex by tightening
environmental controls and strengthening safety rules, Greenpeace
said.
   ``Stello embodies the very attitudes that have brought the
Department of Energy where it is today, to a crashing halt,'' said
Stephen Schwartz, a Greenpeace spokesman. ``Putting Victor Stello in
charge of nuclear weapons production is like putting the Joker in
charge of Gotham City.''
   Greenpeace said several other citizen groups, including the
Environmental Policy Institute and the Union of Concerned
Scientists, are joining in a letter-writing campaign to try to block
Stello's confirmation by the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   NRC spokesman Joseph Fouchard said Stello had not seen the
Greenpeace announcement but was ``not commenting on things of this
kind.''
   Bush said last month he will nominate Stello as assistant energy
secretary for defense programs. No Senate hearing has yet been
scheduled.
   Stello, 54, is a nuclear engineer who joined the Atomic Energy
Commission, the predecessor of both the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and the Energy Department, in 1966. He currently is the
NRC's executive director for operations, in effect the official most
directly responsible for safety in commercial nuclear plants.
   Stello's critics accuse him of siding with utilities in NRC
disputes over compliance with commission rules, and say he has
thwarted investigations by his own agency into rules violations.
   Greenpeace said it had requested a meeting with Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins to discuss the Stello selection. Watkins told a
news conference June 27 that Stello has the experience and desire to
run the nuclear weapons program, even ``if he's a B student to many
people and he has some chinks in his armor.''
   Will Callicott, a department spokesman, said Monday that Stello
still has Watkins' ``full support.''
   Watkins, meanwhile, announced that George H. Miller of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory will become his special
scientific adviser on weapons. Watkins had said earlier he planned
to hire an expert in weapons research and production to offset
Stello's lack of experience in military applications of atomic power.
   Stello would replace Troy E. Wade II, who has held the position
on an interim basis since August 1987.
   The job of weapons chief has taken on added visibility and
political sensitivity since the program encountered a series of
technical and management setbacks last year that, for the first
time, halted the nation's production of nuclear arms materials.
Stello's main responsibility would be to get the program running
again.
   Lando Zech, who stepped down as NRC chairman June 30, vigorously
defended Stello in a farewell news conference, calling him ``an
outstanding public servant.''

   Singers B.J. Thomas, Gene Pitney and The
Shirelles say they were not paid proper royalties when a now-defunct
record company re-released their old hits.
   The pop performers were in federal court Monday as a trial began
in their lawsuit against Gusto Records and GML.
   The singers filed suit in U.S. District Court in December 1987 to
determine ownership of the rights to a collection of oldies, such as
Thomas' ``Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head,'' The Shirelles'
``Soldier Boy'' and Pitney's ``Liberty Valance.''
   The lawsuit claims that master recordings used to make the
original records passed through several firms, such as CBS and
Koala, before being seized improperly by Gusto.
   Gusto Records and GML say the artists either waived their rights
to royalties from record sales or bargained them away to other
record companies.
   ``This trial is to determine whether they are owed any money, and
if so, how much,'' said Carey Thompson, an attorney for the record
companies.
   The lawsuit charges that Gusto failed to pay them royalties of
``well in excess of $10,000 each.''
   Thomas, Pitney and the three surviving members of The Shirelles _
Shirley Owens Alston, Doris Coley Jackson and Beverly Lee _ are
represented by attorneys Samuel Lipshie and Ira Greenberg.
   The lawsuit also names Vernon McFadden Jr., the widower of the
fourth Shirelle, Addie Harris, as a plaintiff.
   Pitney originally signed with Musicor Record Corp. Thomas and The
Shirelles had contracts with Scepter Music.

<HEAD>Crack Available in Almost Every State, DEA Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crack cocaine _ highly addictive and relatively
cheap _ is now available in almost every state thanks to the violent
gangs that distribute it, the Drug Enforcement Administration says.
   Crack, first noted in three U.S. cities in 1981, ``is the fast
food of drugs,'' the DEA reports in a new study, ``Crack-Cocaine
Overview 1989.''
   ``Crack cocaine literally exploded on the drug scene during 1986
and was reported available in 28 states and the District of
Columbia,'' the report says.
   ``It is currently available in almost every state,'' the report
says. DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty added Monday, ``I don't know
if there are any'' states where crack, a smokeable form of cocaine,
has not made an appearance.
   The DEA has stepped up enforcement, seizing about 60,000
kilograms of cocaine in 1988 compared with only 200 kilograms in
1977.
   But the crack epidemic still spread, partly because of extremely
efficient and violent American and Jamaican gangs that distribute
the drug and because crack is highly addictive and relatively cheap,
the report says.
   ``The consumer is supplied with a ready-to-use material that can
be purchased quickly and for small amounts of money,'' the report
said. ``This opens the consumer market to a wider spectrum of
abusers, including youth and the poor.''
   Cocaine hydrochloride, at a cost of $200 per gram on the street,
generally is 70 percent pure, while crack, at a cost of $10 for a
one-tenth of a gram dose, is sold at purity levels of 75 percent to
90 percent, the DEA says.
   ``Never before has any form of cocaine been available at such low
cost and high potency,'' the report said.
   The crack ``problem has spread to rural and suburban areas ...
(and) is now manifesting itself in all strata of society,'' the
report said, but added, ``Crack cocaine remains a predominantly
inner-city, urban phenomenon that is mainly confined to minority
sections.''
   There, the gangs that once fought each other over turf and gang
colors now make big money selling crack, with the Los Angeles-based
Crips and Bloods and the Jamaican posses taking the lead, operating
on a ``no innocent bystander'' theory, the report said.
   Some of the gangs' subgroups are ``showing signs of cooperating
with each other in drug trafficking to promote drug sales and to set
up funds for bail and attorneys,'' the report said.
   ``The more successful drug sets are becoming organized,'' it
said. ``They operate in a more businesslike manner, are
profit-oriented and sophisticated in tactics, i.e., use of computers
and standard business practices.''
   Crack use first was noted in this country in 1981 in Los Angeles,
San Diego and Houston. It was considered a localized phenomenon
until it became a serious problem in New York City in late 1985.
   During the next two years, the DEA detected gang involvement in
crack trafficking, resulting in the widespread surge of availability.
   Crack is made by converting coca leaf to cocaine base, to cocaine
hydrochloride and then back to a new, cleaner cocaine base.
   A person who smokes crack ``receives an almost instantaneous,
intense high lasting only a short period of time (usually eight to
10 minutes) which is often followed by depression and manic
episodes,'' the report said. ``The user is often in a situation
where he must consume larger and larger amounts of crack to even out
these extreme periods of crack highs and lows.''

<TEXT>
   Solidarity activists, jailed for their
political activities just a year ago, say they did not expect then
to wind up mingling with top Communist leaders at a luncheon hosted
by President Bush.
   Bush, who hosted the lawn luncheon Monday, was seated between
historian Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Solidarity delegation in
the National Assembly, and the wife of Polish leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski.
   ``Such a meeting has never happened _ where the U.S. President,
Jaruzelski and the Polish criminals are all present,'' joked
historian Adam Michnik, a deputy in the Sejm who had spent years in
jail for political activities.
   At the other end of a shady patio, Bush's wife Barbara was next
to Jaruzelski at a table including Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the
Solidarity national spokesman, and Jozef Slisz, the head of the
farmers' Rural Solidarity.
   ``It's rather strange when you think that a year ago I was in
prison,'' said Onyszkiewicz, now a Sejm deputy. He was arrested amid
labor unrest in May 1988 when authorities accused him of passing
false information to foreign journalists.
   Other prominent government officials and some two dozen members
of the independent union movement chatted together with American
guests under a large canopy on the back lawn of the residence of
U.S. Ambassador John Davis.
   The friendly atmosphere contrasted sharply with Bush's 1987 visit
to Poland as vice president, when many of the Solidarity guests were
harassed by security forces for their political activities.
   When Bush met Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at the ambassador's
residence during that visit, the union was still banned. Jaruzelski
proclaimed martial law in December 1981 to suppress the movement
that had electrified the nation when first legalized in August 1980.
   Walesa did not attend the lunch. Instead, he invited Bush to his
home today in the port of Gdansk, where he founded Solidarity in
1980.
   While others dipped into minted cantaloupe soup and tasted endive
and watercress salad, Michnik couldn't resist flashing Solidarity's
``v'' for victory.
   Michnik, who had been imprisoned for his political activities,
also gave the U.S. businessman sitting next to him an autographed
copy of an underground political quarterly he edits. He now also
edits the opposition's government-sanctioned daily newspaper.
   Looking East as well as West for support, Walesa told Michnik's
daily that he would accept if Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
invited him to a meeting.
   In an interview with NBC News, Walesa said he admires Gorbachev
and called him ``a great juggler of great class.'' He added: ``He
has to be a great juggler to make it.''
   In just a year, there have been two waves of labor unrest,
historic ``round table'' reform negotiations between communist
authorities and the opposition, and Poland's freest elections in 40
years.
   Lunch for guests on the lawn was served at round tables in a
gesture to the political agreements, Bush said in a toast.
   The president also evoked the dramatic evolution, saying, ``So
much has changed. These are hopeful times in Poland.''
   The guests clapped as Jaruzelski raised his glass and said he was
making his first visit ever to the red brick official U.S. residence
not far from his own home.
   The most moving remarks came from Geremek, who was not scheduled
to speak in the official program.
   ``Roughly two years ago, Vice President Bush and Mrs. Bush talked
with members of Solidarity right in this house, and we heard words
of hope. I think none of us thought then we would meet here in such
circumstances,'' he said.
   In the past, foreign leaders often met with Solidarity
representatives but never in the company of government and party
officials.
   Solidarity's stunning victory and the Communist Party's severe
setback in June elections have transformed the once illegal group of
determined activists into a power center.

   Pregnant women who have AIDS will be given an
anti-AIDS drug for the first time in an experiment to determine if
the drug can prevent their babies from developing the fatal disease.
   The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
announced Monday the experiment with the drug zidovudine, more
commonly known as AZT, will be conducted on 10 women infected with
the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the institute, said the
experiment is an effort to find a way of treating one of the fastest
growing categories of AIDS patients, newborn infants.
   ``The prognosis for children (infected) with HIV is grim,'' said
Fauci in a statement released by his agency. He said babies born to
women infected with AIDS have a 25 to 40 percent chance of
contracting AIDS and the disease progresses much more rapidly in
infants than in adults.
   ``Of those diagnosed before their first birthday, half die within
six months of diagnosis,'' said Fauci. ``It is impossible to count
the costs in pain and heartbreak, and the social and economic burden
of caring for these children is staggering.''
   Since 1981, there have been 1,600 cases of AIDS among children.
Up to three times that number are thought to be infected with HIV.
   The institute said little is known about how AIDS is transmitted
from mother to baby, but it is thought to occur either during
development within the mother, at birth through contact with the
mother's blood, or from breast milk after birth.
   Most AIDS infants are born to mothers who are intravenous drug
users or who have been sexual partners of drug users.
   All of the experiments will be on women who test positive for
HIV, but who are not showing AIDS symptoms.
   In the first phase of the study, researchers will enroll six
women with no recent history of drug abuse. After the six have
completed their course of treatment, the investigators then will
treat four women who are intravenous drug abusers and use methadone,
an approved pharmaceutical used to wean patients from illegal drugs.
   All 10 women will start the study with AZT injections and then
continue through the rest of their pregnancy by taking 200 milligram
AZT pills five times a day. When the test subjects go into labor,
AZT will again be injected.
   Following delivery, the babies will be carefully monitored for 18
months for AIDS and to determine if the AZT treatment affected their
development.
   The experimental treatment will be directed by researchers from
the University of Miami and the UCLA School of Medicine in Los
Angeles.
   AZT is the only approved antiviral drug now available for general
prescription for treating AIDS. The drug can have serious toxic side
effects.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagious
disease that attacks the body's immune system, rendering it
incapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus most
often is spread through close contact with blood, blood products or
semen from infected persons.
   As of May 31, 1989, AIDS had been diagnosed in 97,193 Americans,
of whom more than half, or 56,468, have died since June 1, 1981,
according to the CDC. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.

<HEAD>Brady Cool to FDIC Chief's Third World Debt Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is giving
a chilly reception to a top bank regulator's plan that would rival
his own initiative for easing Third World debt problems.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., says his proposal to partially protect banks from defaults by
debtor nations complements the Brady plan.
   But Brady told reporters Monday, ``We don't think that is
necessary at this point in time.''
   After debt-sparked riots in Venezuela, the treasury secretary
launched an effort in March to persuade banks to reduce the crushing
$1.3 trillion debt borne by Third World nations in Latin America,
Asia and Africa. It was a marked departure from Reagan
administration policy which emphasized new lending rather than debt
reduction.
   Seidman would take the Brady plan one step further by
establishing an International Debt Insurer to encourage banks to
forego repayment of part of the debt by guaranteeing repayment of a
large part of the remaining loans.
   It also would seek to start new money flowing into cash-starved
countries by partly guaranteeing new loans to countries that enact
economic reforms.
   The new agency would be funded by premiums from the banks
themselves, depending on how much debt they held, and by
contributions from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund,
which are supported by member governments.
   Brady, who leaves this week for an economic summit meeting of the
world's seven largest industrial powers, said the group has
previously rejected the creation of an international organization to
deal with the debt problem.
   ``It has been thought about before and not seen to be as good a
way as the way we are going,'' Brady said.
   John Haseltine of the Institute for International Finance, which
represents U.S. and foreign commercial banks, said it is unclear to
what extent the banks' participation will be voluntary, an important
feature if banks are to remain willing to continue lending to
debtors.
   The Seidman plan would give insured debt ``senior'' status to
other debt as a way of discouraging banks from being ``free
riders.'' Thus, banks that didn't go along with debt reduction would
be the first to lose money in the event of a default.
   Seidman first raised his idea publicly in a March speech to the
Bretton Woods Committee, a group of former top government officials
who study international financial issues. He plans to present the
detailed plan at a Bretton Woods dinner on Thursday.
   Seidman's outline describes the current debt reduction process as
a stalemate, but Brady said he was encouraged by progress in talks
between Mexico and its creditor banks in what is seen as the first
test of his plan.
   The two sides reportedly have agreed to the major elements of a
plan to provide Mexico with $3 billion in debt relief, but some
issues remain to be settled.

<HEAD>Rancher-Lawmaker Fights for Cowboy Rights</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While pinstriped city slickers haggle
over taxes, insurance and ``serious'' issues in the Legislature,
cowboy-legislator John Carpenter keeps a vigil for varmints who try
to bushwack cowboys' rights.
   ``There aren't too many of us left anymore,'' Carpenter said.
``We've got to try and preserve our way of life.''
   When a bill to regulate sale and possession of assault rifles
came up for a vote in the Assembly, the cow county Republican rose
in opposition.
   He wasn't against banning assault rifles. He was against a clause
in the bill aimed at Las Vegas gangs that would have outlawed knives
with 4-inch blades.
   Holding his trusty ``old timer'' pocketknife aloft during floor
debate, he drawled, ``If you passed this law as is, every cowboy in
the state would be a lawbreaker.
   ``Besides,'' he added with a Gary Cooper grin, ``there are a few
little operations we have to perform out there on the ranch,''
referring to the castration of bulls.
   The bill was amended in favor of the cowboys, and passed
unanimously.
   The 59-year-old Fallon native also lauded a bill that would fence
off ``devil's holes,'' abandoned mine shafts that dot the Nevada
landscape, because ``cowboys and their horses could fall down one of
those holes.''
   Carpenter, first elected from Elko County to the Assembly in
1985, has applied his own version of horse sense to other matters.
   He suggested castration as an apt punishment for sex offenders.
When someone said sex crimes were more of a mental problem,
Carpenter said, ``Then maybe we should cut off that part of their
anatomy.''
   Carpenter's biggest showdown came over a measure about wild
horses. The bill, backed by animal rights activists, would have made
it a felony to shoot a wild horse. It also would have given the
activists the upper hand over ranchers on a Commission for the
Preservation of Wild Horses.
   The bill was in response to recent shootings of more than 1,000
wild horses on Nevada's northern and central ranges. Animal rights
advocates often blame ranchers for such killings because ranchers
believe the mustangs rob cows and sheep of valuable forage.
   Environmentalists and animal lovers rose with heartfelt speeches
about the beauty of wild horses and their inherent right to roam the
range.
   Carpenter stood in opposition, and when the dust cleared, he won
two victories: the penalty for shooting a wild horse was reduced to
a gross misdemeanor, and ranchers would have as much say as wild
horse advocates on the commission.
   During the peak of his ranching career, Carpenter said, he has
``paid taxes in eight Nevada counties'' where he ran 20,000 sheep
and 7,000 cows on ranches near Austin, Fallon, Ely, and Elko.
   ``In the old days,'' Carpenter said, ``they used to round up the
wild horses, keep the good ones, and sell the other ones at auction.
A lot of the old ones went for dog food. But it kept the population
under control.''
   A year and a half ago, Carpenter sold the last of his livestock
operations. Now, he works out of his Rancher's Realty in Elko, where
he owns a few businesses.
   But he's getting tired of town life.
   ``Once you're a rancher, you're always a rancher,'' Carpenter
said. ``You can't get it out of your blood ... or off your boots.''

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities are at their lowest level in eight months.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion in three-month bills in
Monday's auction at an average discount rate of 7.76 percent, down
from 7.96 percent last week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in
six-month bills at an average discount rate of 7.50 percent, down
from 7.63 percent last week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.54
percent last Nov. 7 and six-month bills averaged 7.48 percent last
Oct. 31.
   The discount rates understate the actual return to investors _
8.03 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,803.80 and 7.90 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,620.80.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 7.97
percent last week, down from 8.28 percent the previous week.

   A federal prosecutor says the decision by Miami
Judge Alcee L. Hastings to return $845,000 in confiscated cash to a
pair of convicted racketeers shocked him.
   ``I was stunned by the forfeiture,'' James Deichert of the
federal organized crime strike force in Atlanta said Monday at the
start of hearings on Hastings' Senate impeachment trial. ``...Out of
the blue he was reversing himself.''
   House members who are serving as prosecutors at the impeachment
trial say the decision to return the money came just days after an
agreement was cemented for a $150,000 payoff to the federal judge.
   Hastings is accused of plotting with Washington attorney William
Borders to get the payoff in exchange for returning the forfeited
cash and keeping the defendants out of prison.
   Impeachment charges approved a year ago by the House also accuse
Hastings of lying to the jury that acquitted him at his 1983
bribery-conspiracy trial and improperly disclosing information
obtained from a federal wiretap.
   Hastings attorney Terence Anderson of Miami contends his client
was the innocent dupe of Borders, an old law school classmate who
was an influential lawyer in Washington in the late 1970s.
   Borders was convicted in the bribery case and went to prison.
Anderson called him ``a big-time rainmaker'' who in order to get
payoffs claimed to have influence with Hastings.
   ``Alcee L. Hastings was, is and will forever be an innocent
man,'' Anderson said.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, told the Senate panel Monday that
Hastings' actions ``present a pattern of misconduct which cannot be
tolerated in a United States district judge.''
   Bryant said the Senate should expel Hastings from the bench even
though he was found innocent in criminal court. ``That acquittal was
the product of repeated lies and the production of fabricated
evidence at his criminal trial,'' he said.
   ``Judge Hastings cannot be prosecuted again. But he can be
removed from office,'' Bryant said.
   Evidence is being heard by a 12-member panel because senators do
not want to tie up the floor and slow the pace of legislation for
weeks. The proceedings are being videotaped for viewing at the
convenience of lawmakers who are not members of the committee.
   Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., hopes to wrap up work
by Aug. 4, two days before Congress plans to leave for the summer.
However, there's no guarantee the complicated legal battle won't
drag on longer for the 12-member panel while other senators go on
vacation.
   Hastings, himself, told reporters on Monday that he is growing
impatient at hearing the same charges against him.
   ``It's deja vu all over again,'' Hastings told reporters after
Monday's first session.
   In a hallway outside the hearing, Hastings called the proceedings
``an abomination'' because they consisted of ``the same old stuff,
and I really resent it, quite frankly.''

   Special interests that lobby the same lawmakers
they pay for speaking engagements are undermining the debate in
Congress, Common Cause says in its latest study of congressional
speechmaking-for-hire.
   Defense contractors directed speaking fees last year to members
of the armed services committees. Tobacco, fertilizer and grocery
interests heard from members of the agriculture committees. Bankers,
the securities industry and home builders listened to the banking
committee members.
   ``Millions of dollars in special interest honoraria fees are
undermining the integrity and credibility of Congress,'' Common
Cause President Fred Wertheimer said Monday, releasing the
congressional watchdog's study of 1988 honoraria giving.
   The group's annual report takes on new urgency this year with
clamor growing for an end to lawmakers' outside income.
   President Bush on July 7 sent Congress legislation to end the
honoraria system by Jan. 1, 1991. Numerous lawmakers have called for
the same thing, but the price would be a politically risky
congressional pay raise that would compensate for the loss of
speaking fee income.
   When lawmakers considered boosting their salaries by 51 percent
earlier this year, the plan was killed after a public outcry.
   Task forces in both houses are expected to consider the pay issue
again along with reform of House and Senate rules. Some members
suggest a salary increase be phased in over several years.
   Common Cause said 20 groups gave at least $50,000 in honoraria to
members of Congress in 1988, led by The Tobacco Institute's spending
of $123,400; the National Association of Broadcasters' $113,500 and
the $106,550 spent by the American Bankers Association.
   The study found the 11 leading givers among defense contractors
paid a combined $457,387 to all members of Congress, with 67 percent
directed to members of the House and Senate Armed Services
Committees and lawmakers on the defense appropriations subcommittees.
   The National Association of Broadcasters paid 60 percent of its
$113,500 in honoraria to members of committees dealing with
communications _ the House Energy and Commerce and the Senate
Commerce committees, the study said.
   Twenty-nine House and Senate members reported NAB honoraria and
travel reimbursement for appearances in Las Vegas and seven for
appearances in Hawaii.
   The National Venture Capital Association, which favors a lower
capital gains tax, paid 88 percent of its $33,000 in honoraria to 22
members of the tax-writing House Ways and Means and Senate Finance
committees, according to the study.
   The National Cable Television Association gave 69 percent of its
$53,700 in honoraria to committee members dealing with legislation
affecting the cable industry, including copyright bills.
   A similar pattern emerged for individual lawmakers.
   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the Energy and
Commerce health and the environment subcommittee, received 76
percent of his total $71,750 in honoraria from commerce and
health-related interests.
   Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., ranking Republican on the House
Armed Services Committee, received 96 percent of his $32,250
honoraria from defense-related interests.
   The chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Kika de la
Garza, D-Texas, earned $29,800 in total honoraria, 97 percent of it
from agriculture-related interests.
   The Tobacco Institute spread its speaking fees around, paying 85
House members and eight senators. RJR@Nabisco, Philip Morris and
the Smokeless Tobacco Council gave another $138,000 to lawmakers,
Common Cause found.
   House members can keep up to $26,850 in outside income, mainly
honoraria, and must donate the rest to charity. Senators can keep up
to $35,800.
   Members of Congress can keep up to $2,000 for any single
appearance, speech or article.

<HEAD>Speaker Says Pay Raise Dead Without Bipartisan Support</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Speaker Thomas S. Foley says he'll keep the
House focused on legislation and won't let lawmakers get dragged
into another pay raise dispute until there's bipartisan support _
and public acceptance.
   Foley said Monday that President Bush's proposal last week to
raise pay for judges and top executive-branch officials left the
door open for Congress to give itself a pay raise, although there
was no specific recommendation.
   But Foley said that while Bush and former President Reagan
supported the increases, they allowed Republican campaign operatives
to blame the Democratic-controlled Congress. That shouldn't happen
again, Foley told a luncheon of Associated Press executives and
reporters.
   ``I don't want to get into something where the president says
yes, and the congressional campaign committee says no,'' Foley said.
``That's unacceptable, that sort of good-cop, bad-cop routine.''
   Foley said it was also unlikely the House would approve Bush's
proposal for 25 percent pay raises for federal judges and top
executive branch officials without also considering a congressional
pay raise.
   Foley opposes such a connection, but said others are not willing
to go along.
   ``There will be ... no disconnection between judges and the
executive branch, and Congress. The underlying reality of that, in
my judgment, is that the votes do not exist to do it,'' he said.
   A special bipartisan committee in the House is examining ethical
questions, including whether congressional pay should be increased
in exchange for tighter restrictions on outside income such as
speech honoraria.
   Foley said any pay raise would have to be of a reasonable scale
and would have to be supported by both Republicans and Democrats in
Congress and in the White House.
   Foley blamed the news media for ``unprofessional'' hype that
helped shoot down a 51 percent congressional pay raise in February
and said a similar outcry would make it hard to bring up a pay
proposal again.
   ``If it's a `here they go again' sort of thing ... beating up on
the Congress, I'm not going to put (lawmakers) through that,'' he
said.
   The speaker said the House has a full agenda of legislation on
returning from the Fourth of July holiday, including the bill to
bail out and toughen regulation of the savings and loan industry,
the 13 annual spending bills, defense policy, child care, and the
clean air bill.
   Foley repeated his position that he would prefer legislation
short of a constitutional amendment to overcome a Supreme Court
decision that allows flag burning. There were fervent pleas from
some members for such an amendment before the break.

<HEAD>USDA Recommends: Just a Spoonful of Chromium</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eat right and stay healthy, says the
Agriculture Department. That includes a smidgen of chromium to keep
things bright.
   ``Drinking a sugary soda after eating a starchy meal and then ice
cream smothered with chocolate fudge can drain your body of
chromium,'' says the department's Agricultural Research Service.
``And few of us get enough of this essential element as it is.''
   Chromium keeps insulin levels in check by making the hormone more
efficient at regulating blood sugar levels, the agency said. And the
more insulin secreted to process sugars from a meal, the more
chromium the body uses and loses.
   When there's not enough chromium, the body pumps out more
insulin, said Richard A. Anderson, who specializes in chromium
research in the agency.
   Few foods provide more than 10 percent to 15 percent of the
minimum suggested intake or chromium, he said. A handful of
breakfast cereals provide more than 25 percent.
   And beer and wine are good sources of chromium.
   Anderson recommends eating a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables,
dairy and whole wheat products, and meat. Some foods and beverages,
such as beer, pick up chromium from equipment during processing, he
said. But other foods lose natural chromium in the refining process.
   But for the most part it all boils down to common-sense advice
USDA has in four new booklets designed to help Americans shop for
food, fix quick meals, eat out and snack.
   Susan Welsh, director of nutrition education for the department's
Human Nutrition Information Service, said Monday that agency studies
indicate consumers ``may be confused by, and weary of, seemingly
conflicting advice on what they should and shouldn't eat.''
   The new effort, including the booklets, is intended to let people
know ``they can eat healthier without changing all their eating
habits overnight or giving up their favorite foods,'' she said.
   Among the common-sense advice is to eat a variety of food,
maintain desirable weight and eat food with adequate starch and
fiber. The agency suggests avoiding eating too much food with fat,
saturated fat, sugar or sodium.
   The suggestions are based on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans
developed by USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services in
1980. The guidelines, slightly revised in 1985, are being reviewed
for further changes, possibly by 1991.
   Booklets include:
   _Preparing Foods and Planning Menus Using the Dietary Guidelines;
$2.50, Item No. 172-V.
   _Making Bag Lunches, Snacks and Desserts Using the Dietary
Guidelines; $2.50, Item No. 173-V.
   _Shopping for Food and Making Meals in Minutes Using the Dietary
Guidelines; $3, Item No. 174-V.
   _Eating Better When Eating Out Using the Dietary Guidelines;
$1.50, Item No. 175-V.
   The booklets may be ordered from: Consumer Information Center,
Department 70, Pueblo, Colo., 81009. Specify title and item number
and enclose a check or money order payable to Superintendent of
Documents.

   Weeks of testing hogs and poultry in 10 states
have produced no evidence of further contamination by the
cancer-causing pesticide heptachlor, according to the Agriculture
Department.
   Ronald J. Prucha, acting administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Servce, said Monday hogs and poultry from more
than 500 producers were sampled and none showed traces of heptachlor.
   The testing began May 8 in Arkansas after illegally high levels
of the chemical were found in a Batesville poultry plant. Three
swine in the Batesville area in February and March were found to
have heptachlor traces, although only one had violative amounts _
any amount more than 0.3 parts per million.
   Contaminated feed has been mentioned frequently as a possible
source of the chemical, and a number of feed mills have been under
investigation.
   Heptachlor was banned in 1978 by the Environmental Protection
Agency for all agricultural uses except seed treatment. It has been
shown to cause tumors in laboratory mice.
   Prucha said testing began in nine states surrounding Arkansas on
May 22, including: Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentuck and Illinois.
   ``We're very encouraged by the results so far,'' he said.
``However, we plan to continue testing for at least the next few
months.''
   Prucha said no further decisions would be made until more
complete results are ready.

   Two agricultural leaders from Israel and Egypt
have been recognized by the Agriculture Department for their part in
cooperative programs aimed at improving world food production.
   Recognition went to Egypt's Mohamed M. Dessouki, first
undersecretary for agricultural development of the ministry of
agriculture, and Prof. Samuel Pohoryles, director general of rural
planning and development in Israel's ministry of agriculture.
   They were among more than 40 people cited Monday by the
department's Office of International Cooperation and Development.
Most work for the agency.
   Other outsiders cited for efforts in international programs
included: Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif.; John Jordan and John
Warren, both of Texas A&amp;M University; and Thomas F. Trail of
Washington State University.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said at the agency's
ceremony that ``it's not hard to defend'' programs that enable
countries to cooperate in research and development projects.
   ``We ought to support them for humanitarian motives alone,''
Yeutter said. ``For those who find that difficult to do, for
whatever reason in terms of budgetary priorities, it seems to me we
can also defend them very readily in terms of economic
self-interest,'' he said.
   Yeutter added: ``We, the developed world, benefit from economic
development in the developing countries.''

   The defense rested its case in the ``Night
Stalker'' mass murder trial Monday, nearly four years after
defendant Richard Ramirez was arrested in connection with a spree of
nocturnal attacks.
   Defense attorneys, seeking to prove that Ramirez was a victim of
mistaken identity, wrapped up their case with two witnesses who
testified Ramirez was in Texas at the time of two of the 15 attacks
for which he is charged.
   Ramirez' sister-in-law, Maria Torres, told jurors that she saw
Ramirez in El Paso, Texas, on May 25 and May 29, 1985, and that her
memory was clear because May 29 was ``the one-month anniversary
after I separated from my husband.''
   Raymundo Pantoja, a friend of Ramirez' father, also testified
that he saw Ramirez on May 25, 1985.
   Ramirez, a 29-year-old drifter and self-described devil worshiper
from El Paso, is charged with 13 murders and 30 related felonies in
a crime wave that terrorized California during the summer of 1985.
   Pentagrams, a symbol of devil worship, were found at some murder
scenes and the assailant gouged out the eyes of one victim.
   The defense called 37 witnesses, many of them testifying that
lighting and other conditions made it difficult to identify the
attacker. Ramirez did not testify.
   Ramirez was arrested Aug. 31, 1985, after a crowd of East Los
Angeles residents recognized him from news photographs and captured
him as he allegedly tried to steal a car.
   Closing arguments were scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>Eastern Has High On-Time Record, High Complaint Record</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines ranks high in on-time
performance but also leads the industry in complaints from
consumers, according to a Transportation Department monthly report.
   The department's Air Travel Consumer Report released Monday
showed Eastern with 13.10 complaints to the government per 100,000
passengers, more than twice the rate of any other airline.
   The figures do not cover complaints made directly to the airlines
but only those received by the government.
   Pan American was second with 6.02 complaints per 100,000 fliers,
followed by Trans World Airlines with 4.59. At the bottom of the
list of 21 airlines were Aloha and Tower airlines with no complaints.
   The report covers a wide variety of consumer complaints,
including problems with fares, overbooking, baggage handling,
customer service, advertising and smoking on flights.
   In the category for lost or mishandled baggage, Eastern had the
lowest number of reports, 2.67 per 1,000 passengers in May. The
reports on baggage and the flight performance were for May and
overall consumer complaints to the government covered June.
   The report cautions that the baggage statistics are based on
reports from the airlines and may not be comparable because carriers
have differing methods of reporting.
   The report showed America West leading in on-time performance,
with 91.7 percent of its flights arriving on time in May, followed
by Eastern with 87.2 percent and Alaska Airlines with 87 percent.
The report noted, however, that the Eastern statistics covered far
fewer flights than normal because of the ongoing walkout by the
airline's Machinists union, which has been joined by pilots and
flight attendants.
   Eastern and Alaska airlines both reported no ``chronically late''
flights in May. Leading that category was Pan American with 5.6
percent of its flights late more than 70 percent of the time.

   The cop buddy team of Mel Gibson and Danny
Glover proved lethal in the weekend box office sweepstakes with
``Lethal Weapon II'' drop-kicking ``Batman'' from atop the
box-office charts.
   ``Great Balls of Fire!,'' the rockumentary about musician Jerry
Lee Lewis, collapsed to 10th place in its second week.
   According to box-office figures released Monday, ``Lethal Weapon
II'' grossed more on Saturday alone ($7.8 million) than the original
``Lethal Weapon'' made during its entire first weekend in 1987.
   The sequel sold $20.4 million worth of tickets last weekend.
   For ``Batman,'' the caped crusader brought in $19.2 million last
weekend, but fell out of the top spot for the first time since the
movie's June 23 premiere.
   In third place was the Disney comedy ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Kids,'' which drew $9.4 million to pass $50 million. In fourth was
the comedy sequel ``Ghostbusters II'' with Bill Murray, on sales of
$5.3 million.
   The Steven Spielberg-directed ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade'' finished in fifth, collecting $5.205 million. ``Dead Poets
Society,'' the bittersweet drama starring Robin Williams, landed in
sixth place with $5.186 million.
   In seventh, falling sharply from its opening weekend, was
``Karate Kid III,'' with sales of $4.9 million. Right behind was the
new comedy ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' which collected $4.5 million
during the weekend but $6.4 million since opening on Wednesday.
   Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing'' finished in ninth with $2.9
million. ``Great Balls of Fire!'' netted only $2.2 million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations Co., with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release.

<TEXT>
   The Air Force says pilots and air crews will be
allowed to wear soft contact lenses because they can improve
eyesight under combat conditions.
   Pilots and crews in fighter, attack and reconnaissance aircraft,
as well as instructor pilots and those whose duty requires the use
of night vision goggles will be issued the lenses, said a statement
issued Monday at the Pentagon.
   As in the past, new pilots will be required to prove they have
perfect, or 20-20 vision, said a spokeswoman for the Air Force
Surgeon General.
   But if a pilot or crew member's vision worsens after they have
completed their training, and it can be corrected to the 20-20
level, he or she will be allowed to use either spectacles or the
soft contact lenses, said spokeswoman Patti Turner.
   ``Now, it's their choice,'' Ms. Turner said.
   The new policy is effective immediately, she said.
   A statement issued at the Pentagon said soft lenses have been
shown ``to improve the combat capability of some U.S. Air Force crew
members who require vision correcting lenses.
   ``Their use has been proven to provide an operational advantage
over the wear of spectacles in missions which require maneuvering
flight, the use of night vision goggles, the constant wear of an
oxygen mask, and the ability to quickly look to the far limits of
lateral gaze,'' the statement said.
   Ms. Turner said pilots and aircrews will only be allowed to use
extended-wear lenses, since those are better suited to the
conditions crews will encounter.
   However, the lenses will not be allowed to be worn around the
clock or when sleeping, Ms. Turner said. Nor will tinted or
disposable types of lenses be allowed.
   Also, those who choose to use the lenses must keep their glasses
at hand in the event that they encounter a problem or lose one, she
added.
   While only certain fliers will be issued the lenses, others will
be able to purchase them through civilian eye care specialists after
the approval of their flight surgeon, the statement said.
   Army spokeswoman Paige Eversole said helicopter and fixed-wing
pilots are still not allowed to use contact lenses, although that
matter is being studied.

   The Hunt brothers, heirs to one of the world's
greatest fortunes, are in court defending a partnership created to
repay debts they suffered when the silver market collapsed nine
years ago.
   Once Texas billionaires, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert Hunt
are contesting some $150 million in taxes the Internal Revenue
Service says they owe from the partnership's dissolution in 1982.
   A third brother, Lamar, is contesting $500,000 in taxes in a
non-jury trial expected to last up to a month before U.S. Tax Court
Judge Jules G. Korner III.
   In a windowless room in U.S. Tax Court filled with stacks of
heavy boxes, charts and a team of lawyers on both sides, the
brothers and their wives listened Monday as the IRS argued the
partnership was a taxable financial arrangement to restructure debts
from a silver-buying binge.
   ``The partnership was created to provide financial relief to the
petitioners at a time when they needed it very badly,'' IRS attorney
Deborah Butler said in opening arguments.
   But an attorney for the Hunts claimed the partnership, set up in
an ``atmosphere of panic'' to repay debts after the silver price
collapse in March 1980, was a legitimate business and not the
``colossal sham'' the IRS claims.
   ``The suggestion that 10 or 12 of the largest banks in the United
States would knowingly participate in structuring such an elaborate
sham must be viewed as far-fetched,'' said Michael Henke, an
attorney for Bunker and Herbert Hunt.
   The trial covers only 1982, but government attorneys say the
outcome could affect other IRS claims against Bunker and Herbert
Hunt in preceding and subsequent tax years.
   Those claims, totaling $1 billion in taxes and interest, exceed
what the brothers say their assets are worth in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court documents filed in connection with their Chapter 11
reorganization.
   And because the IRS is a priority creditor in Bankruptcy Court,
the outcome of the tax trial could determine the size of Hunt
settlements with other bankruptcy court creditors.
   Lamar Hunt is not in bankruptcy court.
   In opening arguments Monday, Henke said the Hunts formed the
partnership with Placid Oil Co. after a New Jersey company
threatened the family's flagship business, founded in 1935 by their
father, legendary Texas oil wildcatter H.L. Hunt.
   ``The Hunts' silver problems came to a head at the end of March
1980 when Bunker and Herbert Hunt were unable to come up with $434
million to pay Engelhard (Corp.) for silver they had agreed in
January to purchase,'' Henke said.
   Henke said testimony would reveal the precious metals trader and
chemical manufacturer ``threatened a lawsuit to pierce the six
trusts owning Placid'' to collect its debts.
   Under the disputed partnership agreement, Placid contributed cash
and notes totaling $824 million, obtained through a $1.1 billion
loan from a consortium of banks.
   The Hunts contributed silver, gold stocks, coal properties and
other assets that Henke said had an ``aggregate gross value of more
than $1 billion and a net contribution value of approximately $408
million.''
   Though Henke claims the Hunts contributed coal properties worth
$294 million in 1980, the IRS claims those properties were worth $16
million. And when the partnership was dissolved, the IRS claims the
coal properties were worth $6 million, compared with Hunt claims the
coal properties were worth $262 million.

<HEAD>Agency Denies Bungling Defector Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Intelligence Agency says a defector
from the Soviet Union's KGB is free to go if he doesn't like it here.
   In a rare public statement, the agency on Monday denied it had
mishandled the case of Victor Gundarev, 49, former security chief of
the Soviet Embassy in Athens.
   The CIA said it ``welcomes an inquiry by the intelligence
committees in Congress'' into its handling of Gundarev.
   According to an article by David Wise in The Sunday New York
Times, Gundarev defected from the KGB in February 1986.
   Wise, who has written extensively about the CIA, said Gundarev
wrote him, ``I came to the conclusion after three years in U.S.A
that those people who would like to defect with the help of CIA
should think twice,'' and was seeking an interview at the State
Department with Soviet officials to discuss going home.
   Wise compared the case to that of Vitaly Yurchenko, head of North
American espionage for the KGB, who defected in Rome in 1985.
Yurchenko retreated to the Soviet embassy in Washington less than
three months later and held a specatular press conference to the
embarrassment of the CIA.
   Gundarev, wrote Wise, has written CIA Director William Webster
that he and his wife and son were promised ``a normal way of life as
free citizens in a democratic country,'' but his belongings were
searched, his telephone tapped and his letters opened.
   ``From the beginning they treated me as a dangle (a false
defector), another Yurchenko, specially sent,'' Wise quoted Gundarev
as saying.
   The CIA statement said, ``The allegation that the CIA invades the
privacy of individuals, as described in The New York Times article,
is false. So, too, is the charge of mishandling.''
   The agency said it and the FBI had tried hard to smooth
Gundarev's transition to U.S. residence, had resettled him in an
undisclosed location and had paid him ``a substantial amount of
money'' for his information.
   ``As with all individuals residing in this country legally, Mr.
Gundarev is free to travel to any country he chooses,'' the CIA said.
   Wise said Gundarev's information had proved less than top-notch
in some instances. John Bothwell, a former CIA agent and submarine
captain, was arrested in Britain on the basis of Gundarev's report
that Bothwell was an agent he ran, but charges against Bothwell
later were dropped.

<TEXT>
   A federal Food and Drug Administration chemist
and two generic drug company executies were charged Monday with
bribery in an investigation into corruption in the FDA, a federal
prosecutor said.
   Walter Kletch, an FDA chemist in the Division of Generic Drugs in
Rockville, Md., is accused of receiving two $500 gift certificates
from Dilip Shah, president of Quad Pharmaceuticals of Indianapolis,
said U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox.
   The generic drugs division reviews applications submitted by
pharmaceutical companies seeking to market such drugs. FDA chemists
must ensure that the drugs are safe and effective and are equivalent
to their brand-name counterparts.
   Kletch was responsible for reviewing Quad's applications.
   Shah and Ashok Patel, a former executive of Par Pharmaceuticals
of Spring Valley, N.Y., have been accused of bribing Charles Chang,
an FDA branch chief. Both Par and Quad had applications reviewed by
chemists supervised by Change, the charges say.
   The charges were in a criminal information, a document equivalent
to a indictment but not requiring a grand jury.
   If convicted, Kletch, Shah and Patel would each face a maximum
penalty of two years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Chang has pleaded guilty to two counts of interstate travel in
aid of racketeering for accepting furniture and a trip around the
world from another generic drug manufacturer. He is awaiting
sentencing.
   Previously charged in the probe were Raj Matkari, a drug company
executive who pleaded guilty to bribing Chang, and David Brancato, a
review chemist in Chang's branch who pleaded guilty to receiving
cash gratuities from Shah and Patel.
   Matkari and Brancato also are awaiting sentencing.

<TEXT>
   Harold Ezell was ousted as regional
immigration commissioner Monday, saying his only regret was
attending a party for deposed Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos
and his wife, Imelda.
   ``In hindsight, there's no way I would have gone to that
reception knowing what I know today,'' he told a news conference on
his last day with the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``Although nothing happened that was illegal or immoral, I regret
the perception it created,'' the INS' outgoing Western regional
commissioner said of the August 1988 party in Honolulu at which he
was videotaped.
   At the gathering, Ezell led partygoers in a prayer asking for the
Marcoses' safe return to the Philippines, which would be against
President Corazon Aquino's wishes and U.S. policy.
   Asked what he knows now that he didn't know then, he said, ``We
didn't know they were going to be indicted. We would not have gone
knowing that.''
   The Marcoses were indicted on charges they plundered billions
from the Philippines.
   Ezell said, however, that he believed the incident had nothing to
do with the acceptance of his resignation.
   Ezell, who has served as western region commissioner since 1983,
said last month that he expected to be replaced after INS National
Commissioner Alan Nelson resigned.
   He had submitted his resignation in March after George Bush
became president, but said as late as May that he wanted to keep the
job until late next year.
   He acknowledged Monday that he would have preferred to stay until
November 1990, the end of the second phase of the immigration
amnesty program. As commissioner, Ezell coordinated the INS amnesty
program in the Western region, where about half of the nearly 3
million immigrants who applied for amnesty live.
   Ezell, 52, headed a region that encompassed California, Nevada,
Arizona, Hawaii and Guam.
   But while he was given good marks for the smooth operation of the
program, Ezell often drew fire for remarks that some considered
tasteless.
   Ezell said he suffered ``great pain'' from public perceptions of
him as anti-Hispanic, an allegation he said was untrue.
   ``If you speak out strongly, the cheapest shot they can use is to
say a person is anti- one group or another,'' he said.
   Ezell said he was proud of his accomplishments with the INS,
declaring, ``We have served our country and our people the best
(way) possible.''
   Ezell said he would return to the private sector.
   Acting INS Commissioner James Buck named Robert Moschorak,
associate regional commissioner for operations in the western
region, to replace Ezell temporarily.

<TEXT>
   The government doesn't spend enough to fight crime,
which is up 40 percent this year, the top Soviet law enforcer said
in appealing for funds to raise salaries and put more and better
equipment on the streets.
   Interior Minister Vadim V. Bakatin told the legislature, or
Supreme Soviet, on Monday that his department, which runs the
national police, doesn't have the resources to stop crime.
   He said the economic problems and moral decay that are unwanted
byproducts of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program had
contributed to a 39.9 percent rise in serious crime when compared to
the first half of 1988.
   Adolescent crime has risen 22 percent so far this year and
unreported crime is growing at three or four times the rate of
recorded crime, he said.
   ``Unbalanced development in the economy, politics, social and
moral spheres is inevitable in the transition period,'' Bakatin
said. This ``in turn provokes tension, shortages, social injustice
and stimulates crime.''
   The United States spends $100 per capita on police, whereas in
the Soviet Union, the figure is $12, he told the lawmakers.
   Bakatin spoke shortly before the 542-member Supreme Soviet voted
to retain him as interior minister, a post he has held since October.
   He was subject to confirmation along with nearly 60 other
officials appearing before the new legislature, which has rejected
several candidates for the Supreme Court and Cabinet.
   Many Soviets are afraid to walk the streets at night because of
an increase in murders, muggings and rape. Shortages that have
worsened steadily under economic reforms have created a demand for
stolen goods that spurs on robbers.
   Gorbachev has acknowledged that the restructuring he initiated
since coming to power four years ago could lead to more crime.
   At the confirmation hearing, Gorbachev said he had been impressed
by the number of police he saw during a June 12-16 visit to West
Germany.
   He said he was told there is one policeman for every 400 Germans.
Bakatin said that in the Soviet Union there is one for every 588
citizens.
   The Soviet Union once kept crime statistics secret, claiming
socialism was free of crime rampant in the West.
   ``A theory was cultivated for many decades that crime here was
considered officially a rudiment of social antagonism from
exploiting societies which should die as socialism developed,''
Bakatin said. ``But it didn't.''
   Meanwhile, another government candidate up for legislative
approval, Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov, told legislators the
health system is in the ``most severe crisis.''
   Chazov, who was confirmed, said about 63 percent of the country's
hospitals and 59 percent of its clinics are in substandard
buildings, some 24 percent of hospitals have no sewage facilities,
and 15 percent lack running water.
   Chazov also said that the Soviet Union spends less money than any
developed country on health care _ 3.2 percent of the Soviet gross
national product _ versus 6 percent to 8 percent in the United
States.

   Improved weather helped fire crews defeat several timber and
brush fires across the West on Monday, but flames still kept
hundreds of people away from homes and campgrounds.
   A firefighter was killed by a falling tree in California's scenic
Big Sur country, and a firefighter died after being struck by
lightning while fighting a blaze in Arizona's Tonto National Forest.
In Colorado, archeologists accompanied fire crews to prevent damage
to artifacts near Indian cliff dwellings.
   Some 11,540 firefighters were on the lines, up about 1,500 from
Sunday, said Ann Finkelstein of the federal Interagency Fire Center
at Boise, Idaho. New fire teams and helicopters were sent from
Alaska, where weekend rain knocked down four big fires, freeing up
personnel and supplies.
   Finkelstein said that as of mid-Monday, 44 fires burned
uncontrolled, covering about 167,000 acres, an increase of about
50,000 acres from Sunday.
   After a week of temperatures in the 90s and above over much of
the West, lower temperatures, lighter wind or rain gave firefighters
a break in parts of Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico.
   ``The weather's been real cooperative and that's been the real
saving factor,'' said Kathy Campbell of the Malheur National Forest
in Oregon, where clouds and lighter wind helped contain a 3-day-old
blaze Sunday.
   But firefighters still had to contend with dry air and wind in
Utah, Idaho, Nebraska, Colorado and California. Southwestern Texas
also had no rain, but higher humidity helped slow a 150-acre fire in
Big Bend National Park.
   Some 200 evacuees were not allowed to return to their homes and
an unknown number of people were evacuated Monday in the path of a
1,900-acre fire near Sugarloaf Mountain west of Denver that
destroyed at least 49 homes and other structures in Boulder Canyon
on Sunday.
   The fire still was spreading Monday but containment was expected
soon, said sheriff's spokeswoman Sharon Digiacomo.
   Sheriff Brad Leach said the fire was set Sunday by a resident.
   ``We know for sure where the fire started and that it was from
somebody's trailer,'' Leach said. ``We're questioning that
individual to try and determine whether he knew he did it or whether
it was an accident.''
   Colorado firefighters facing humidity as low as 10 percent had to
cope with more than two dozen forest fires covering several thousand
acres of rain-starved timber and brush in the central and western
parts of the state.
   Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado, the site of
Anasazi Indian cliff dwellings, was closed while six archaeologists
traveled with fire crews to help save artifacts from a fire that had
burned 2,350 acres.
   The fires did not threaten the cliff dwellings, which are in the
canyons. The archaeologists were along as advisers to ensure that no
archaeological sites in fire areas atop the mesa were disturbed by
the digging of fire breaks.
   That part of the state got light rain Sunday.
   Firefighters fought raging pockets of fire in Nebraska's largest
state park and tried to prevent the flames from heading west into
more rugged terrain.
   Officials estimated it at 50,000 or more acres, over an area 22
miles by eight miles. Patients from a hospital and nursing home in
Crawford were evacuated and several hundred people were removed from
the park.
   The federal government dispatched a slurry bomber to help dampen
the fire near the village of Glenn, said Gov. Kay Orr.
   Officials warned that if the fire wasn't stopped on its western
flank it could endanger the small town of Harrison, about 12 miles
to the west.
   ``Last I heard, they were afraid of losing it right there,'' said
Sheriff Karl Dailey. ``Once it gets into that terrain, the ground
troops can't do anything.''
   About 100 campers evacuated a campground Sunday in the Cleveland
National Forest in Southern California. By Monday the fire had
charred more than 4,000 acres and was only 10 percent contained.
   ``Heavy fuel is a problem and the terrain is really rough. It's
real steep and rocky,'' said Chris Cundari, a fire information
officer for the California Department of Forestry.
   Crews in Utah were close to containing a 15,500-acre fire in
rough, remote terrain about 20 miles west of the Colorado state
line, said Mary Plumb of the Bureau of Land Management.
   She said aerial reconnaissance crews Sunday spotted a ``fire
funnel,'' a swirling tower of flame and debris like a dust devil
rising 15,000 feet above the fire, an example of the ``really
extreme fire behavior and conditions.''
   Firefighters in Oregon on Monday night contained a fire that
burned across 850 acres of sagebrush, juniper and mixed conifers
along the edge the Fremont National Forest, and hoped to contain a
957-acre blaze about 10 miles to the west by Tuesday evening.
   Fire bosses expected to contain a 150-acre blaze in western
Idaho's Payette National Forest Monday night, and to control it
within 24 hours.
   Cool, wet weather has lowered the danger of forest fires in
Washington state, and firefighters there were being sent to other
Western states, officials said.
   About 450 federal firefighters were helping battle forest fires
in other states, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Ron DeHart.
About that many remain in the state to ensure protection, he said.

   Mel Blanc, who entertained generations of
cartoon viewers as the voice of Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Barney
Rubble, Tweety and hundreds of other characters, died Monday
following a lengthy hospital stay. He was 81.
   The creator of such classic cartoon trademarks as Bugs Bunny's
``Eh, what's up, Doc?'' Porky Pig's ``Th-th-th-th-that's all
f-f-f-folks'' and Road Runner's ``Beep, Beep'' died at 2:30 p.m.
from complications of heart disease and other ailments at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise.
   He had been suffering from cardiac problems and emphysema when
admitted May 19.
   Blanc performed the voices on 850 cartoons for Warner Bros. in a
career spanning more than 50 years. His versatility was so profound
that few would have presumed just one actor was behind so many
markedly different characters. He also performed voices on countless
other cartoons, such as ``The Flintstones'' for Hanna-Barbera, and
commercials and radio fillers.
   In an interview last November, he estimated he had done 900
voices in all.
   ``Those voices were part of him, and he loved every moment of
it,'' said his son, Noel. ``When the kids would come to the door or
in the studio, he became those characters.''
   Blanc made a car commercial on the day he went into the hospital
``and the last thing he said on the commerical _ the only thing he
said _ was `That's all folks,' and that's the last thing that was
recorded on tape,'' his son said.
   ``The reservoir of Hollywood legends is extremely low, and Mel
Blanc's passing is a deep personal loss,'' said longtime friend
Mickey Rooney.
   Working decades before the advent of high-tech sound effects,
Blanc was a human synthesizer and a verbal computer. It has been
estimated that more than 20 million people hear his voices daily.
   Blanc had a ``magnificently versatile voice,'' said Robert A.
Daly, Warner's chairman and chief executive officer. ``Bugs Bunny,
Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Sylvester the Cat, Tweety and so many more _
they were all Mel Blanc.''
   Besides Warner Bros., Blanc worked for other animated film
makers, playing the part of the hyperactive, yammering Dino, Fred
Flintstone's pet dinosaur. Within the industry he was known as ``The
Man of a Thousand Voices.''
   Blanc said he once tried to count all the cartoon voices he did,
while recuperating in 1961 from a near-fatal car accident. He said
he fell asleep shortly after passing the 400 mark.
   Blanc's last cartoon contribution came with 1988's popular
animation-live action film, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' in which he
did the voices of Daffy, Tweety, Bugs and Sylvester. He wrote an
autobiography that year, ``That's Not All, Folks: My Life in the
Golden Age of Cartoons and Radio.''
   Blanc also played the voice of the robot Twiki on the live-action
television series ``Buck Rogers in the 25th Century.''
   Blanc said in an interview last year that Bugs Bunny _ originally
called Happy Rabbit _ was his favorite. ``Everybody knows who I am,
Doc,'' he said in the character's voice. ``I don't cayuh where dey
are who dey are. Even in Mars dey know about me.''
   Born in San Francisco on May 30, 1908, and raised in Portland,
Ore., Blanc discovered his vocal skills while in grammar school.
   He began his career in show business both as a musician and a
radio perfomer. He started in 1927, when he sang and performed on a
Portland radio show called ``The Hoot Owls.''
   He and his wife, Estelle Rosenbaum, subsequently wrote, produced
and performed all the characters for the daily radio show ``Cobwebs
and Nuts.''
   In 1928, Blanc _ who played the bass, violin and sousaphone _ was
hired by the NBC Radio Orchestra in San Francisco.
   Starting in 1937, he became part of Warner Bros.' cartoon studio,
which produced one short feature subject each week.
   His first Warner Bros. character was a drunken bull in the Looney
Tunes short ``Picador Porky.'' As legend has it, the actor playing
Porky Pig in that short actually did stutter. A few months later,
Blanc took over the role in ``Porky's Duck Hunt,'' stuttering
intact, and created Daffy Duck at the same time.
   Blanc introduced Bugs Bunny in the 1940 short ``A Wild Hare,''
giving the cartoon rabbit a combination Bronx and Brooklyn accent.
   Blanc invented the voices of such well-known cartoon figures as
Woody Woodpecker, Speedy Gonzalez, Pepe Le Pew, Tasmanian Devil,
Road Runner, Foghorn Leghorn, Heathcliffe the cat, Speed Buggy and
Yosemite Sam.
   He also did voices for Mr. Spacely on ``The Jetsons'' and the
Frito Bandito. In 1987, Blanc performed in the Daffy Duck short
``The Duxorcist,'' marking the return of Looney Tunes movie shorts
after a 20-year absence. He also worked on the 1988 short ``The
Night of the Living Duck,'' which kicked off the New York Film
Festival.
   Blanc said persistence paid off in landing the Warner Bros. job.
Frequent trips to the studio seeking an audition were met with
constant rejection by the personnel manager.
   ``That didn't stop me,'' Blanc said in a 1980 Associated Press
interview ``I kept going back every two weeks and always got the
same answer.
   ``Finally the guy died. The man who took his place decided to
give me a chance.''
   During Warner Bros. cartoon film short heydey, which lasted well
into the 1950s, few people in the United States recognized Blanc's
face, but hardly anyone was unfamiliar with his voices.
   From Sylvester's ``Thufferin' thuccotash!'' to Tweety's ``I tawt
I taw a puddy tat,'' Blanc's voice characterizations became
household tidbits of U.S. popular culture.
   Blanc called Bugs his favorite character, although he hated the
taste of carrots he chewed for sound effects and spit the uneaten
remains in the trash can.
   But for all his fame as the voices of cartoon characters, the
most Warner Bros. ever paid him for his vocal skills was $20,000,
and the studio retained the rights to the phrases Blanc invented.
   In addition to working in animation, he was a regular on radio's
``The Jack Benny Show,'' playing Professor LeBlanc, Benny's violin
teacher, and the train dispatcher who announced the stops of
``Ana-heim, A-zusa and KOOK-amunga!''
   Blanc also played Carmichael the Bear, Sy the Mexican gardener
and made the wheezing sounds of the timeworn 1924 Maxwell automobile
owned by Benny's skinflint comedy character.
   He reprised many of the roles when Benny moved to television.
   He married Miss Rosenbaum in 1933. Their son, Noel, was born five
years later. Blanc once said the only person who can imitate his
repertoire of cartoon voices was his son.
   Blanc is survived by his wife and son. Funeral arrangements were
pending.

   Tornadoes slammed four Northeastern states Monday, killing at
least one person in Connecticut, injuring scores more and ripping up
dozens of homes and businesses. Thousands were left without power
and at least 200 people were believed homeless, officials said.
   Tornadoes wreaked havoc in two upstate New York towns and a Long
Island village, around three central Massachusetts communities and
in northwestern and coastal Connecticut. Twisters, which are unusual
in the Northeast, were also reported in northern New Jersey.
   Intense thunderstorms boomed over New York's Long Island and
Westchester County, producing damaging winds, hail and lightning.
Scattered storms also fell over southeastern New York, southern
Connecticut and northern New Jersey.
   The New York twisters cut a narrow path through the Putnam County
towns of Carmel and Brewster 30 to 40 miles north of New York City.
A separate tornado hit the Long Island village of East Moriches,
said Suffolk County fire communications spokesman Jay Sardone.
   Two people were treated for cuts from shattered glass and two
people were injured in separate auto accidents during the storm,
said Putnam Hospital Center spokeswoman Marjorie Schneider. One of
the car crash victims was admitted to the hospital, but his injuries
were not believed to be life threatening; the others were treated
and released.
   Both the Putnam and Long Island hospitals were operating on
emergency generators.
   About 10,000 Long Island Lighting Co. customers were without
power, the utility reported. ``It's a complete wipeout,'' said
utility spokeswoman Sue Roschak.
   A tornado tore off roofs and walls in a 250-unit condominium
development in Carmel, severely damaging 35 homes and damaging 35
others, said Putnam County spokesman Ken Lott. Red Cross spokesman
Larry Mackler estimated 200 people were left homeless.
   ``You're looking at these condos and the front walls are just
gone,'' said Eric Gross, a reporter for radio station WVIP who lives
in Carmel.
   ``You can look in and see their furniture on the second floor,''
he said. ``People told me they heard this horrible wind, looked
outside their windows, grabbed their kids and ran into the basement.
There are trees, five, six and seven feet in diameter that snapped
like matchsticks. Cars overturned and others were crushed.''
   Gross, who was on the outskirts of Carmel when the tornado hit,
said the storm lasted no more than two minutes.
   The Red Cross set up an emergency shelter at Carmel High School
with 200 cots, but virtually no one had gone to the shelter by early
Tuesday. People either stayed at the development to keep watch on
their property or stayed with friends and relatives, Lott said.
   Hundreds of Putnam County homes were without power and utility
crews were out working on downed power lines, said spokesman Mark
Welte of New York State Electric &amp; Gas, which serves the area.
   The Long Island tornado roared through a private airport,
demolishing a trailer that housed a skydiving school and injuring a
man inside. A small airplane was destroyed and several were damaged.
The man was hospitalized in good condition.
   In central Massachusetts, a series of ``mini-tornadoes'' knocked
out power and telephones, felled trees and damaged homes in the
Princeton, Steling and West Boylston areas.
   Most of the damage, however, was in woods, said Tom Holmes, chief
meteorologist at the National Weather Service's Worcester station.
   No injuries were reported.
   About half of West Boylston, a town of about 6,000 people, was
without electricity or phone service.
   More than 3,000 people in western Massachusetts were also without
power, said John Gustavsen of Northeast Utilities.
   Mini-tornados are small tornados 50 to 100 feet in length that
touch down briefly. Holmes termed the storm a ``super-thunderstorm.''
   In 1953, a tornado in Worcester and surrounding areas killed 90
people.
   In Connecticut, tornadoes were reported in Bantam in the state's
northwest corner and in the New Haven and Hamden areas, where the
mayors declared states of emergency. Heavy rain and golfball-size
hail fell in some areas.
   Waterbury Mayor Joseph Santopietro imposed a 10 p.m. curfew to
keep curious townspeople from hampering the storm cleanup. The city
also opened a shelter at Kennedy High School for those whose homes
were damaged.
   At least five homes in Hamden were destroyed and an industrial
park damaged when a tornado wound through the town around 5:30 p.m.,
police said.
   A 12-year-old girl was killed when a tree fell on the tent she
was in at Black Rock State Park in Watertown in west central
Connecticut, state police said. Three other girls in the tent, part
of a church group from Stratford, were injured and taken to
hospitals in Waterbury.
   Thirty-seven people were treated in New Haven hospitals or minor
injuries, and 27 people were treated at Waterbury Hospital for
mostly minor injuries, although several people suffered broken
bones, officials said.
   More than 112,000 people in northwestern and southern Connecticut
were without power, said spokesmen for Northeast Utilities and
United Illuminating.
   ``Every crew we have is on the road and then some,'' said United
Illuminating spokesman Robert Fort, who estimated it would take 24
hours to restore power to all customers.
   Some the approximately 600 National Guardsmen on duty Monday
night were dispatched to Hamden and Waterbury to help assess the
damage, said Jon Sandberg, a spokesman for Gov. William A. O'Neill.
   In northern New Jersey, twisters left behind downed electrical
wires and fallen trees, but no injuries were reported.

<HEAD>Parks Officials Hoping Pond Piranhas Weren't Frisky Fishies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just when people thought it was safe
to go near a city park's pond, word comes that two piranhas caught
there were male and female.
   ``There could be eggs,'' said Jared Dow, who along with his
friend Jason Kraus, both 16, hooked the second of the piranhas
Sunday night from Alice Keck Park Memorial Gardens' pond.
   Park officials, though, are keeping their fingers crossed that
nothing fishy was going on between the piranhas.
   ``Chances are, they hadn't been acclimated to the pond where they
were reproducing,'' said park superintendent Jeff Cope. ``Hopefully,
we've closed this chapter.''
   The story began earlier this month when people noticed that some
of the shallow pond's fish and turtles had been viciously attacked.
Two piranhas were spotted.
   The pond, in the center of the city, is a popular dumping ground
for unwanted fish.
   The first piranha, a female, was caught Friday by park officials
fishing with liver as bait. The second eluded capture. Officials
tried everything, including electronic shock equipment.
   Fishermen, meanwhile, lined the pond until late at night, to the
dismay of parks officials who said the fishermen were harming fish
and other wildlife.
   Among the outlaw anglers were Dow and Kraus, who hooked the
16-inch, 2-pound male fugitive Sunday night with liver bait.
   ``I thought it was a bass because it was jumping out of the water
at first,'' said Dow, a gas station attendant. ``Then we saw the
teeth. The teeth on this one were a quarter-inch long.''
   Dow kept the fish in an aquarium overnight, and hauled it Monday
in a water-filled ice chest to the city Park Department for positive
identification. Since Dow cooperated, no citations were issued for
illegal fishing.
   ``They just told me not to do it again,'' he said.
   The fish was taken to a taxidermist for stuffing and will be
mounted next to its partner in the department's offices.

   Pollutants from burning coal could be cut by
more than half at older power plants linked to acid rain, according
to a study.
   The study was produced Monday by the Energy Department as part of
a $5 billion program with private industry to develop ``clean coal''
technologies.
   A draft analysis of the environment effects of the new
technologies concludes that they could reduce national emissions of
sulfur dioxide from existing coal plants by as much as 45 percent by
the year 2010, the study said. Nitrogen oxide emissions could be cut
by as much as 33 percent over the same period.
   Both are precursors of the acids that form and fall as acid rain
when smokestack gases are carried long distances by the wind.

<HEAD>USDA Says Donated Apples Will Be Safe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donated apples may contain traces of Alar but
still will be safe, according to the Agriculture Department.
   The USDA announced last week it would spend up to $15 million in
an effort to help reduce a huge surplus of apples created when
consumers stopped buying amid fears over the use of Alar. The plan
was for the USDA to give the apples to schools, prisons, public
assistance food programs and others.
   But the USDA now says growers will donate the apples to various
groups and then be reimbursed.
   The industry has estimated that 5 million to 7 million boxes of
apples from last year's crop, valued at between $40 million and $56
million, remain unsold with this year's harvest only weeks away.
   Alar is used to enhance apple color, ease of harvesting and life
in storage.
   The controversy began in late February when a private
environmental advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council,
said eating apples treated with the chemical substantially increases
the risk of cancer in children. The Environmental Protection Agency
and the Food and Drug Administration disputed the report as a major
exaggeration of the risk.

<HEAD>SEC Again Proposing New Capital Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a trip back to the drawing board, the
Securities and Exchange Commission is again proposing a rules change
that would make it easier for corporations to raise capital through
the private sale of securities.
   The commission voted 5-0 Monday to seek another round of public
comment on revisions to its controversial proposal to eliminate some
restrictions on the resale of securities offered privately.
   The rule would create what the SEC terms a ``safe harbor'' from
registration and disclosure rules for the resale of privately
offered securities to big institutional investors.
   Supporters of the change say it would lower financing costs for
companies and would attract foreign companies to raise capital in
the United States. But critics claim it would increase the power of
large institutional investors, such as banks and insurance
companies, while cutting into the business of stock exchanges.

   The stifling desert heat radiates from the
sidewalk outside the Tropicana Hotel where the band that for years
provided the music now walks a picket line to protest its
replacement: taped music.
   Inside the lavish resort, singers lip-sync and dancers kick their
legs to recorded music during the popular Folies Bergere show's
twice-nightly performances.
   Musicians are locked in a fight for survival at the Tropicana and
two other Strip resorts, where cost-conscious managers also want to
replace live music in production shows.
   ``The musicians ultimately make the product that puts musicians
out of work,'' lamented Mark Tully Massagli, leader of Musicians
Union Local 369. ``Think of the irony of that.''
   The conversion to tape now affects about 45 full-time musicians,
but it has raised passions among many more who feel spontaneous
entertainment is being sold out by gaming corporations.
   ``We can't have this town _ which was built on live entertainment
_ go the other way,'' said singer Sammy Davis Jr. ``Don't let them
do this to us.''
   Davis and a few other big name entertainers gathered recently to
back the musicians.
   ``If we lose live music in this town, we've got serious
problems,'' said comedian Jerry Lewis.
   Lewis and Davis were appearing together at Bally's, which plans
to replace the 19 musicians backing its Jubilee production show with
taped music but keep live musicians in its main showroom.
   Hotel officials say musicians are an expensive luxury not found
in Atlantic City, N.J., hotels, which allow taped music and
synthesizers in place of live performances.
   ``We're not doing away with musicians in the Celebrity Room,''
said Robert Ostrovsky, a Bally's executive. But ``we feel taped
music is appropriate for production-type showrooms.''
   The 14 union musicians who backed the Folies Bergere show at the
Tropicana walked off their jobs June 3, upset over the hotel's
unwillingness to budge on the issue. The show was closed while a
tape was prepared, and reopened June 25 to what hotel officials say
are increasingly full audiences.
   ``We're doing very well with it,'' said hotel spokesman Ira David
Sternberg.
   Musicians at Bally's and the Flamingo Hilton, meanwhile, have
stayed on the job despite the refusal of the hotels to increase
their offer of two to four musicians at each hotel on the payroll
and severance pay to the others.
   Officials at the three resorts sent letters to the musicians last
week informing them they would not be needed further when they
implement their final offer on July 26 and go to taped music.
   Perhaps more ominous, however, to the estimated 250 musicians who
make a living in the hotels is a plan by the resorts to pay
musicians only for the shows they actually perform.
   Many entertainers bring their own bands to Las Vegas, limiting
work for the Las Vegas musicians.
   Under the contract that expired June 1, musicians were guaranteed
their $654.71 a week salary for at least 38 weeks a year.
   The pickets have tried to rally support by warning that musicians
who fill the city's symphony and small jazz bands may be forced to
leave town to find work, leaving a cultural void in the city.
   They also took out a $12,000 ad in the Los Angeles Times warning
tourists of the strike.
   And the union has won a few victories in negotiations. Massagli
said the Stardust Hotel has agreed to a contract keeping musicians
at its long-running Lido de Paris show and the Union Plaza has
agreed to live music at its smaller production show.
   But the major Strip resorts usually set the trend, and that is
where the musicians believe may be their last stand.
   ``Our entire future is at stake here,'' Massagli said. ``This is
for our very survival.''

   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen on
Tuesday, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose moderately.
   The dollar finished trading at 139.62 yen, up 0.34 yen from the
previous day's close of 139.28 yen. It opened at 139.47 yen and
ranged between 139.47 yen and 139.78 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 70.75
points, or 0.21 percent, closing at 33,746.77. The index had shed
27.95 points Monday.
   The index rose as participants were reassured after morning gains
and a stability in the dollar-yen rate within the 139-140 yen range,
dealers said.
   A Nomura Securities dealer said, however, the volume was still
small due to participants' concerns over the election for the upper
house of the parliament, scheduled for July 23. He spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Analysts have predicted the governing Liberal Democratic Party
will lose badly in the election, hurt by the Recruit Co.
influence-peddling scandal, an unpopular sales tax imposed in April
and reports that Prime Minister Sousuke Uno has kept several paid
mistresses.
   In recent days the LDP has been further hit by reaction to
reports of remarks by Agriculture Minister Hisao Horinouchi that
``women are useless in politics.'' Next came politically damaging
reports that Minister of Home Affairs Shigenobu Sakano said Monday
that the 3 percent consumption tax should be raised at a time that
many people are calling for its repeal.
   The Nomura dealer said participants have been avoiding buying
issues before the election, fearing a major LDP loss, which might
cause share prices to plunge.
   In currrency dealings, traders attributed the dollar's strength
to a similar trend in New York despite the currency's declines
against several other foreign currencies.
   Lacking major market-affecting news, participants were concerned
over the release of the U.S. wholesale index Friday, said a dealer
at the Bank of Tokyo who spoke anonymously.

   Nuon Chea, who for years held the No. 2
spot in the Khmer Rouge power hierarchy in Cambodia, has asked to
retire, a radio report said.
   The clandestine Khmer Rouge radio on Sunday quoted a letter from
Nuon Chea to Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan saying he wished to
retire once Vietnamese troops pull out of Cambodia. A transcript of
the report was seen today.
   Nuon Chea, 63, was among the small circle of communist
revolutionaries who brutalized Cambodia during their 1975-78 rule,
when hundreds of thousands of people died from Khmer Rouge
executions, famine and civil unrest.
   A Vietnamese invasion ousted the Khmer Rouge from power and the
movement has since waged guerrilla war from bases along the
Thai-Cambodian border.
   In June, Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot asked to resign from his last
official post but Western analysts were skeptical that he had really
called it quits.
   Negotiations on a Cambodian peace settlement have focused on the
need to remove Pol Pot and other of its top leaders before allowing
the Khmer Rouge it to share power with the Vietnamese-installed
government in Phnom Penh and the non-communist groups with whom it
has forged a loose resistance coalition.
   Nuon Chea formally held the No. 2 position after Pol Pot and
briefly replaced the latter as prime minister in 1976.
   Others in this inner circle, which continues to dominate the
Khmer Rouge, were Ieng Sary, Son Sen, Ta Mok, Khieu Samphan and the
wives of Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and Son Sen.
   Nuon Chea reportedly continued to have a key role after the Khmer
Rouge ouster from Phnom Penh although little is known about the
inner workings of the secretive leadership.
   The letter, dated June 7, said Nuon Chea had reached the
retirement age of 60 in 1986 but had continued to ``take part in the
resistance struggle to fight the Hanoi Vietnamese for national
liberation.''
   It did not say what position he had held.
   Vietnam has said it will pull its troops out of Cambodia by the
end of September, but Khmer Rouge media have accused Hanoi of
secretly planning to disguise Vietnamese soldiers as Cambodians
after the withdrawal.

   A single-engine plane sturck power lines
and crashed early Tuesday near a residential neighborhood,
authorities said.
   Police said they were told the plane had taken off from Arlington
Airport and crashed about 2 a.m. south of Interstate 20.
   The fate of the plane's occupant was not immediately known.
   An Arlington Fire Department crew was sent to the crash site.
   ``At this point, officers are still checking to see whether the
plane hit any houses,'' said Officer Desmond Freeman. ``We still
don't have much information from the scene.''
   Freeman said the plane struck power lines.
   ``There were reports of the plane being flown erratically over
parts of the city,'' he said. ``That is what brought our attention
to it.''

   The Weber family managed to carry a few
armloads of possessions to three waiting cars before turning to
watch their Boulder Canyon home go up in flames.
   ``The fire was so intense it just engulfed the house,'' said
Brian Weber, 18.
   Weber had tried to protect the house by clearing a 60-foot swathe
around it with a chainsaw.
   He tried spraying the house with a garden hose, and draping it
with wet blankets.
   Nothing worked.
   ``We got the TV and the computer, the expensive stuff,'' said his
mother, Laurette Weber, 45. ``What we got out the door in about 10
minutes is all.
   ``We didn't get any pictures, heirlooms, or anything like that.
We got the clothes on our back.''
   The Webers, interviewed Monday in the lobby of a shelter at
Fairview High School, were among more than 40 families displaced by
the massive fire near Sugarloaf Mountain, about 10 miles west of
Boulder in north-central Colorado.
   Alexia Sokolov said she barely got out of her home alive.
   ``First, I smelled smoke, and then I saw the flames,'' she said,
still coughing.
   ``I was thinking I had more time than I did,'' she said. ``It's
really strange to think very quickly what you want out of 35 years
of your life.''
   In addition to their home, the Webers lost eight sheep, eight
goats and a pickup truck. They are unsure if their chickens survived
the fire. They did save their two dogs and at least two of their
four cats.
   Dressed in sooty jeans, a T-shirt and a yellow Sugarloaf
Volunteer Fire Department jacket, Laurette Weber said she, her
husband and their two sons will rebuild their home, which was
uninsured.
   ``If the foundation's good, we'll start there,'' she said. ``If
not, we'll tear it out and start all over ... I imagine we'll do it
ourselves. We can't afford to pay someone to do it for us.''
   The family spent Sunday night on bare floors at a friend's empty
house.
   Wanda Gilmer, who lives in the same area, said her house had been
spared so far, ``but it could go.''
   She added, ``I told my husband I never did like the style of that
kitchen. It gives me a chance to redo it.''

<HEAD>Meese Testifies at Wedtech Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prosecution was given more time to prepare to
cross-examine Edwin Meese III after the former U.S. attorney general
testified that longtime friend E. Robert Wallach never sought favors
for the Wedtech Corp.
   Meese took the stand at Wallach's racketeering trial in federal
court Monday.
   Meese, who resigned as attorney general in July 1988, was faulted
in an internal Justice Department report released in January for his
efforts to help Wallach in an ill-fated, Mideast oil pipeline
proposal and to assist him with Wedtech.
   The department's Office of Professional Responsibility found
Meese had violated internal departmental standards of conduct and an
executive order on ethics.
   Meese has never been charged with any crimes in connection with
the Wedtech case.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Baruch Weiss's cross-examination of Meese
was put off until Thursday after Weiss complained to U.S. District
Judge Richard Owen that he didn't know about Meese's appearance
until 10:30 p.m. Sunday and needed more.
   During his hour-long testimony, Meese appeared relaxed.
   ``Did Mr. Wallach ask you to intervene in any way, shape or form
in the Wedtech investigation?'' asked Wallach's attorney, Gary
Neftalis.
   ``No, absolutely not,'' Meese said.
   ``Did you intervene in any way in the Wedtech investigation?''
Neftalis asked.
   ``No, I did not in any way,'' he replied.
   Wedtech, now defunct, was a small South Bronx machine shop that
grew into a $100 million defense contractor through a Small Business
Administration program that set aside contracts without competitive
bidding for minority-controlled companies.
   Evidence at earlier trials has shown that Wedtech continued to
receive the no-bid contracts through bribes even after it ceased to
be minority-owned.
   Wallach; W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtech board member and
onetime Meese financial adviser; and a business associate of theirs,
R. Kent London, are charged in a 21-count racketeering indictment
with extracting almost $2 million in illegal payoffs and payments
from Wedtech, including some $525,000 in alleged bribes to Wallach
to influence Meese and other government officials.
   Meese said Wallach, 55, told him in 1981 _ when Meese was a
high-ranking adviser to President Reagan _ that Wedtech would be a
good company for the administration to spotlight in its proposals
for urban enterprise zones.
   Wallach also told him about the company's efforts in 1981 to
secure an Army contract to build small engines, Meese said. Wallach
said company officials felt they were not being treated fairly by
the Army.
   Meese said he passed on the problem of the Army contract to his
staff, who referred the matter to the Office of Cabinet Affairs at
the White House. He said he had received ``probably dozens'' of
similar complaints during his time at the White House. He said he
did nothing further.

   More than 9,000 dockworkers went on strike
nationwide today and half a million municipal employees began a
two-day walkout, the latest in a sudden burst of British labor
unrest.
   Subway and railroad workers, meanwhile, threatened to hold
another one-day strike on Wednesday. It would be the fourth such
walkout in four weeks.
   But rail workers also agreed Monday to hold their first direct
negotiations since May, raising hopes of a possible settlement in
the chronic transit dispute that has periodically forced millions to
seek alternate transportation.
   About 9,400 dockworkers at 60 ports went on strike at midnight
Monday to protest the decision by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
Conservative government to scrap a 1947 law guaranteeing dockworkers
jobs for life.
   The law was enacted because of widespread labor abuses at the
docks during that time. Mrs. Thatcher's government, which has curbed
many union powers in the 10 years she has been in power, argued that
such a guarantee is outdated.
   The National Association of Port Employers predicted the strike
would fail. The 60 ports affected handle just 43 percent of shipping
traffic, with the rest going through Britain's other 102 ports. Many
of the 102 have been developed since 1947 and were never covered by
the lifetime job guarantee.
   Many shippers have arranged for cargoes to be transferred from
the 60 ports affected by the strike to other ports.
   But Ron Todd, general secretary of the 1.3 million-member
Transport and General Workers' Union to which the striking dockers
belong, said: ``Let's see what they (the port employers) say at the
end of the first month or the second month or the third month of the
strike.''
   The 48-hour strike by more than 500,000 members of the National
Association of Local Government Officers is part of a series of
protest strikes this year to demand higher wages. The walkouts have
disrupted municipal services ranging from library services to
garbage collection.
   Unions say a major cause of this summer's labor unrest is
inflation eating into wages. Britain's annual rate of inflation now
stands at 8.3 percent, the highest it has been in seven years.
   In other labor disputes this summer, strikes have regularly
closed passport offices, halted London bus services and caused
cancellation of news and current affairs programs on British
Broadcasting Corp. television and radio.
   Railroad and subway workers both planned one-day walkouts
Wednesday to demand higher wages.
   But hopes for an end to the rail dispute surfaced on Monday when
rail unions oficials agreed to meet today with British Rail, the
board that runs the state-owned network. It would be the first
direct talks since early May.
   The series of 24-hour strikes called by the 117,000-member
National Union of Railwaymen have completely shut down the network
each Wednesday since June 14.
   On Monday, in a separate move, the 17,500 train drivers of
another union, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and
Firemen, began an indefinite overtime ban, severely disrupting
services on a day-to-day basis.

   A moderate earthquake shook several
Northern California communities, but no damage was reported.
   The tremor, which measured 4.5 on the Richter scale, struck at
9:15 p.m. Monday and was centered about 10 miles west of Bishop, the
U.S. Geological Society said.
   ``It rolled,'' said Pam Galvin of the Bishop Police Department.
``I was standing up doing some work and I felt the ground roll under
me. It was really bizarre. I've never felt one like that before.''
   It also was felt 120 miles to the west in Fresno and in Mammouth
Lakes.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage.

   Violence marred a special holiday called by
United Mine Workers to restore calm to the strike-scarred mines, and
UMW President Richard Trumka sought to reassure a big Japanese coal
buyer.
   Miners ambushed security men at dawn Monday at a non-union mine
in Boomer, 35 miles southeast of Charleston, injuring several
guards. An explosion damaged an office trailer in Virginia, and a
shooting incident was reported in Alabama.
   Trumka, who has asked union miners east of the Mississippi to
stay off the job Monday through Wednesday, met in New York with
Eishiro Saito, president of the Nippon Steel Corp. and head of a
major Japanese business group.
   ``We expressed to them that we are a stable supplier of coal
worldwide,'' Trumka said.
   The Westmoreland Coal Co., based in Philadelphia, announced that
it was falling short on orders of 308,176 tons promised to seven
foreign clients because of production wildcat strikes that idled its
mines. The company said it would be unable to fill additional export
orders for 165,865 tons unless mining resumed by the end of the week.
   Trumka said he was opposed to strike-related violence, but did
not specifically refer to Monday's episodes.
   ``Too often, miners have been the recipients of violence,'' he
said.
   More than 30,000 UMW members have been on wildcat strikes
throughout Appalachia and the Midwest for the past month in support
of 1,900 union members striking since April 5 against The Pittston
Co. in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
   In the worst violence Monday, about 150 people ambushed a group
of security men at the entrance to the non-union Boomer mine, owned
by Appalachian Mining Inc.
   Shots rang out, and several guards who scuffled with the
attackers suffered minor injuries, said Cliff Nuckols, head of
Nuckols and Associates Security Inc., of Cincinnati.
   ``It was pitch black. The whole thing happened within 30-40
seconds,'' he said.
   State police said they were investigating.
   Judge Paul Zakaib told the manager of a motel in nearby Dunbar on
Monday that he could not evict Nuckols'company, which uses 30 rooms
at the hotel as a base for guarding non-union mines in the coal
fields.
   Dunbar Travelodge manager Mike Mowry said picketing UMW members
were driving away potential customers.
   In Virginia, a federal judge ordered three men jailed, one for
three months and the others for one month each, for using convoys to
block routes to the mines.
   It was the first time jail sentences had been issued for the
tactic, which has been used widely by the UMW since the Pittston
strike began.
   U.S. District Judge Glen Williams had complained last week that
huge fines levied against the union were ineffective in keeping them
from using the tactic.
   In other violence:
   _Police said two trucks and a car were overturned and several
security personnel suffered minor injuries when strikers confronted
non-union miners at an operation in Fayette County, southeast of
Charleston. Troopers made one arrest for destruction of property.
   _Two coal trucks were hit by gunshots near the Black Pearl Mine
at Prenter, about 30 miles south of Charleston.
   _Four non-union G&amp;W trucks at Jasper, Ala., were struck by
bullets, the Walker County Sheriff's Department said. No injuries
were reported, and no arrests were made, authorities said.
   _In Dickenson County, Virginia, an explosion damaged an office
trailer owned by Clinchfield Coal Co., Pittston's main subsidiary in
the state, police said.

<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp
told black leaders he'd like to see a campaign to revitalize the
nation's urban neighborhoods.
   ``I think we should start right here in Motown, take those 15,000
boarded-up houses and fix them up,'' he told 3,000 NAACP delegates
Monday. ``We should ask General Motors and Chrysler and Ford to
help.''
   His speech, during the second day of civil rights group's annual
convention, only briefly touched on the investigation of alleged
influence-peddling and theft at HUD. Kemp promised the scandal would
not be used as an excuse to gut housing subsidies for low-and
moderate-income Americans.
   ``We're not going to allow it to be a reason to close down the
programs of HUD,'' he said.
   In an address marked by three standing ovations, Kemp praised the
organization as the central mover in the fight for equality for
minorities.
   Kemp, a leader in Republican efforts to recruit blacks, described
the civil rights fight as a two-step process that is half completed.
   ``Chapter One is a proud part of our country's history,'' Kemp
said. But the United States can't effectively promote itself as a
model for the world until it finishes the next stage _ achieving
economic racial equality, he said.
   Speaking next, United Auto Workers President Owen Bieber said he
was a lifetime member of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, and credited the 80-year-old group
with helping the union get a foothold in the auto industry 50 years
ago.
   The convention is drawing an array of politicians and
entertainment figures, including Vice President Dan Quayle, who
speaks Wednesday. Also appearing are 1988 Democratic presidential
aspirant Jesse Jackson, Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan, national Democratic Chairman Ron Brown and television talk
show host Oprah Winfrey.

   At a barren desert highway intersection,
an informal gathering of aviation buffs celebrated the B-2 stealth
bomber's first power tests with foaming beer and a rally round the
American flag.
   For weeks, an assortment of people fascinated with the all-wing,
radar-evading bomber from Northrop Corp. have been turning up around
sunrise, waiting in expectation of a glimpse of the costliest
warplane in history.
   Monday, they were satisfied, when the approximately $500
million-a-copy B-2 rolled ponderously from its secure hangar and
taxied down the Air Force Plant 42 runway at about 100 mph.
   ``It was an awesome sight to see,'' said hot dog vendor Norm
Masten as he offered up a breakfast frank and sauerkraut to a B-2
watcher. ``If I were an enemy of this country and I saw that I would
be shaking in my boots.''
   The sleek, manta-shaped strategic bomber successfully conducted
taxi and engine tests for the first time, and in public view,
stopping traffic on Sierra Highway, the main desert thoroughfare
alongside Air Force Plant 42.
   Air Force officials say more ground tests will be conducted this
week, and first flight within the next two weeks.
   People at the intersection drank beer, sipped soft drinks and
munched Brooklyn hot dogs with Coney Island onion sauce ladled out
by vendor Masten from his Little New Yorker hot dog franchise. A
large American flag whipped in the breeze from above the trailer as
Masten fixed franks and dug deep for mustard, sauerkraut and pickles.
   Masten was doing a land-office business at the corner of Sierra
Highway and Avenue `N.' An hour after the test, motorists were still
stopping to investigate the commotion where rarely anyone stirs
among the spiny Joshua trees and desert sagebrush.
   Hundreds gathered at various times, wheeling in with motor homes,
sports cars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.
   Chief among the watchers was retired Marine John MacWhirter, who
had been out on the highway before dawn each morning for two weeks
for a glimpse of the stealth from his yellow step-van, which was
decorated with patriotic slogans, peppered with salty observations
about actress Jane Fonda and Iran.
   ``It looked like a Volkswagen with wings,'' MacWhirter declared
happily, adjusting his red USMC baseball cap. ``It looks like Buck
Rogers. It looks like Flash Gordon. I wouldn't have any anxiety at
all about it flying tomorrow.''
   Cars stopped for about a mile along the highway so people could
gawk at the strange sight of the bomber in the bright desert
sunshine.
   Jake Brown, a rangy Navy boatswains mate formerly assigned to the
battleship USS New Jersey, said that when he heard the stealth was
emerging from its hangar he telephoned work to say he'd be late.
   ``I called my boss and boogied,'' said Brown, who arrived at the
area's favorite aircraft-watching corner just in time to see the
V-shaped bomber enter the taxi way and get up to speed.
   ``We're into airplanes out here,'' Brown declared as he gazed at
familiar skies where planes such as the B-1, the U-2 and the SR-71
Blackbird often conduct tests.
   The stealth is the nation's most expensive and controversial,
coming into the Pentagon arsenal during a period of increasing
budget cuts.
   Although many congressional critics have argued that the plane is
either unnecessary or too expensive at a $70 billion program cost,
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney has declared the stealth bomber a
linchpin of America's strategic defense policy.

French officials said.
   Vicki Keith completed the 17-mile crossing at 4:36 a.m. on the

Dover on Monday morning.
   The officials said the boat accompanying Miss Keith radioed,
``The swimmer has arrived without problems.'' She immediately
returned to England by boat without lingering in France.
   Three previous efforts by other swimmers to cross the Channel
using the fast but exhausting butterfly stroke had failed short of

<TEXT>
   President Bush, in a dramatic windup to his
trip to Poland, flew to the birthplace of Solidarity today for talks
with Lech Walesa and his independent trade union allies who sparked
a political upheaval in this Communist nation.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, arrived from Warsaw where the
president unveiled a modest aid program for Poland on Monday, the
first day of a 10-day European tour that will include an economic
summit of seven industrial democracies in Paris later this week.
   Bush may come under pressure from Walesa for a $10 billion
package of Western credits and investment guarantees for the
beleaguered country.
   Bush has ruled out anything that large, and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III said Monday no one really expected the president
``to show up here with a big wheelbarrow full of dollars.''
   After a day of talks Monday largely with government leaders in
Warsaw, Bush was meeting Walesa in the Baltic Sea city of Gdansk.
From there, Bush was traveling to Budapest, Hungary, for another
two-day stay.
   Bush has been a longtime backer of Solidarity, and if he was to
attract big crowds anywhere in Poland, Gdansk was the place.
   After a luncheon at the house Walesa shares with his wife Danuta
and their eight children at 54 Polanki Street, Bush was accompanying
the union leader to the towering Solidarity Workers Monument outside
the Lenin Shipyards.
   Walesa, in an interview Monday, said Poland is making progress
with its political freedoms faster than it is tackling its economic
problems.
   He said he wants Bush ``to help us make this correction'' so that
financial matters are addressed with the same emphasis as political
affairs.
   Crowned by three crosses topped with anchors, the Solidarity
monument commemorates the first three shipyard workers killed by
government security forces during 1970 strikes over food prices that
left 45 dead and 2,000 injured.
   To drum up a big audience, Solidarity workers distributed
leaflets about Bush's visit and his speech at the monument.
   In Warsaw, Bush drew crowds that were relatively small, numbering
no more than 3,000 people at any site.
   Even so, Baker said Bush was not disappointed. ``It's not some
election campaign where we've gone out here and tried to turn out
crowds,'' he said.
   The president spent more than two hours in talks Monday with
Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski and then met with him
again over lunch and again at a state dinner.
   Solidarity representatives also attended the luncheon, and one of
them, Bronislaw Geremek, the union leader in the House, got the seat
of honor at the head table next to Bush. Jaruzelski sat at a
separate table with the president's wife, Barbara.
   As the president's motorcade arrived at Radziwill Palace for the
dinner, demonstrators among 1,000 people outside could be heard
shouting ``down with communism'' and ``Jaruzelski must go.''
   There was no indication whether Bush could hear the protests,
which appeared to have been staged by splinter opposition groups.
   In a toast to Bush, Jaruzelski said, ``May our relations always
feature mutual respect, confidence and friendly feelings.''
   Interviewed later on ABC News, Jaruzelski said he spoke with
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev about the meeting and added that
Bush's visit was positive for future relations.
   ``I really am heartened that the leaders of the two big powers
are guided by the same intentions and I feel that this bodes well
for the future,'' Jaruzelski said.
   The general, who imposed martial law in 1981 to crush Solidarity
and imprison its leaders, said union representatives now share
responsibility with the government for Poland's ``destiny, its
well-being, its position in Europe and in the world.''
   Solidarity representatives won nearly half the seats in recent
parliamentary elections, and Walesa has not ruled out the
possibility of running for the new, powerful post of president.
   In his toast, Bush repeated the theme of encouraging political
and economic reforms, while cautioning that Poles face a period of
economic belt-tightening.
   ``Reform is a difficult process, as you well know,'' Bush said at
the dinner. ``There are neither easy answers nor cost-free
solutions. But there is a sound basis for hope.
   ``And today, you have the goodwill of an expectant and hopeful
world,'' he said.
   In an address to Parliament, Bush said he would ask Congress to
create a $100 million fund to help encourage development of the
private sector in Poland. He also said he would ask for $15 million
to fight pollution in the city of Krakow.
   Bush said he will ask leaders of six other industrialized nations
attending a summit with him in Paris late this week to support
rescheduling up to $5 billion of Poland's $39 billion international
debt.

<HEAD>Charges Dismissed in Case Involving Right to Face Accusers in Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed child molestation
charges against a man whose conviction in the case was overturned by
the U.S. Supreme Court because he was not allowed to face his
accusers in court.
   Judge C.H. Pelton on Monday dismissed charges against Jon Avery
Coy, 38, on the recommendation of a prosecutor who cited the
reluctance of two girls to testify and the weakening of physical
evidence. The new trial was to have begun Monday.
   Coy was convicted in 1985 of two counts of lascivious acts with a
child for allegedly entering a makeshift tent where two 13-year-old
girls were camping and forcing them to perform sexual acts with him.
   Coy's attorney, John J. Wolfe, appealed on the grounds Coy was
denied his constitutional right to confront his accusers.
   When the case was first tried, a one-way screen was used to keep
the girls from seeing Coy while they testified.
   The U.S. Supreme Court voted 6-2 in 1988 to overturn the
conviction, agreeing that Coy had been denied the right to confront
his accusers. The court returned the case for a new trial.
   Following the dismissal, Coy said, ``I still maintain that I was
not the man they were looking for.''
   He has been living in Pennsylvania since his release.
   ``I'm glad it's over,'' Coy said. ``It's caused me a lot of
heartache.''
   Clinton County Attorney Larry Schultz, who entered the motion to
dismiss the case, said although his office had worked with the girls
for several months, they were reluctant to testify.
   ``The victims believe that their identities are generally unknown
at this time, and that they will, if the trial proceeds, become the
subject of some curiosity and have their lives become the subject of
some public scrutiny,'' Schultz said.
   ``The victims are now 17 years old. They have spent the past four
years attempting to put the tragedy of August 1985 behind them,''
Schultz said.
   He said the request for expanded media coverage made by two
television stations added to the state's decision. The request would
have allowed cameras to film part of the trial, although not the
girls' testimony.
   The death of Clinton Police Sgt. Lyle Smith made the state's job
more difficult, prosecutors said. The motion said Smith's testimony
was critical in establishing the location of certain physical
evidence against Coy.
   The state also discovered that hair specimens located at the
scene have disappeared since the trial.
   In the trial, the girls testified they could not see the face of
their attacker because he wore a mask and shined a flashlight in
their eyes.
   According to testimony, Coy's fingerprints were found on the
flashlight.

   Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack
F. Kemp has asked Congress to repeal a new law that protects the
families of drug dealers against eviction from public housing, The
New York Times reported today.
   The law jeopardizes HUD's efforts to simplify evicting the actual
drug dealers by making it ``harder for a housing authority to evict
a tenant for drug-related criminal activity than for non-payment of
rent or other violations of the tenant lease,'' Kemp wrote to
members of the House and Senate appropriations committees.
   The law poses ``a significant setback to our efforts to establish
drug-free public housing,'' the letter said.
   The law was attached to a spending bill that was passed hurriedly
last month in time for the Independence Day holiday. It took effect
June 30 when President Bush signed the spending bill.
   Congressional leaders said most members did not even realize they
had voted to require housing authorities to make sure that evictions
of drug dealers did not affect innocent members of the same
household, the Times said.
   ``The chances for reversal are excellent,'' said Rep. Bob
Traxler, D-Mich., chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee
on HUD and Independent Agencies.
   The eviction provision apparently was agreed to in negotiations
between Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Banking Committee, and Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., a member of the
Senate Appropriations Committee, the Times said.
   The newspaper quoted unidentified Congressional aides as saying
Gonzalez had been concerned that the streamlined eviction process
for drug dealers might penalize innocent people.

<TEXT>
   Romania is making military threats
against Hungary and soon could become a threat to the security of
its Soviet bloc neighbor, Hungary's foreign minister says.
   The allegation was the latest sign of worsening relations between
the countries, whose leaders met informally Saturday to discuss
their differences but apparently only worsened the huge rift between
them.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, speaking at a news conference in
advance of President Bush's visit today to Hungary, said Romanian
media had carried ``certain military types of threats'' against
Hungary.
   Horn refused to be more specific. Romanian military publications
have reportedly devoted considerable space recently to deteriorating
Romanian-Hungarian relations.
   Horn also implied that Romania might one day threaten nuclear
action.
   He said that if a nation's leaders claim ``they are capable of
producing nuclear weapons and that in the not-too-distant future
they will start on the manufacture of medium-range missiles, this .
.. will have an impact on the neighboring nation, in this case
Hungary.''
   In April, President Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania said his country
has the potential to make nuclear weapons.
   Ceausescu and Rezso Nyers, chairman of the Hungarian Communist
Party, were involved in a ``very sharp'' round of talks on Saturday
in Bucharest, where the leaders had gathered to attend a Warsaw Pact
summit, Horn said.
   Horn had said Saturday, after he attended that meeting, that
relations between the two nations were now at ``a bottom point.''
   ``We took stock of all problems affecting our relations and the
only area where agreement was reached was that we are neighbors and
better relations are in (our mutual) interest,'' Horn had said after
the meeting.
   Horn was quoted Saturday by the state-run Hungarian news agency
MTI as saying that ``the emergence of certain military threats in
recent months also affect heavily our relations. We see such
manifestations as if the Romanians were deliberately attempting to
incite hostility.''
   However, on Monday, Horn said, ``We do not want to overdramatize
this, but we cannot let it pass either.''
   The nations have been engaged in an escalating war of words over
Hungary's allegations that Romania is mistreating its 1.7
million-member ethnic Hungarian minority.
   Hungary also is strongly opposed to a Romanian rural resettlement
plan that it says could destroy ethnic culture and tradition by
moving Hungarians out of their native villages, thousands of which
are being razed.
   Relations have been further worsened by Hungary's decision more
than one year ago to accept refugees from Romania. About 30,000
people have since fled to Hungary, most of them ethnic Hungarians.
   Romanian media have increasingly charged that Hungary is seeking
to reverse the borders established by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon,
which granted Romania the territory of Transylvania.
   Most of the ethnic Hungarians live there. For centuries, the area
was ruled by Hungary.
   However, Horn quoted an unidentified Romanian general as having
described the Trianon treaty as unjust because Hungary still retains
territories inhabited by Romanians. About 20,000 ethnic Romanians
live in Hungary, mostly in its southeast.
   Horn also said Monday that Ceausescu had ruled out a fact-finding
mission to Romania by an impartial international delegation, but
confirmed that a low-level Hungarian delegation could visit Romania.
   He said the Hungarian side at the talks asked that the delegation
be allowed to study the village-razing scheme but that Ceausescu
said the Romanians would determine the delegation's itinerary.
   Horn also said Hungary was prepared to hold a meeting of the two
premiers, but only ``if we can discuss all of the problems and
achieve some kind of agreement on their solutions.''
   The Hungarian foreign minister told reporters that no third
country, including the Soviet Union, had been asked to help improve
relations between the countries.
   Referring to Bush's visit, Horn said officials hope to give the
president ``a realistic picture of our country's politics and
economy.''
   Hungary has embraced political and economic reform and closer
ties to the West, while Romania has maintained hard-line adherence
to communism.

   A car thief probably didn't envision he would
become a good Samaritan by stealing a dilapidated convertible, then
fixing it up and painting it.
   The owners of the classic 1976 Volkswagen recovered it more than
three months after it was stolen from a parking lot outside their
north Dallas apartment. But Charlie and Sharon Reed hardly
recognized their beloved ``Bugaloo.''
   The banana yellow VW had undergone about $1,200 worth of repairs,
including new bumpers and fenders and other improvements. Police in
Corsicana, 45 miles southeast of Dallas, called the Reeds on
Saturday after the car was found at a used car lot there.
   ``I think they aligned the front end, too,'' Reed said of the
thieves.
   ``It used to shimmy real bad. The only thing they didn't replace
is this rubber strip on the back bumper. Shouldn't be 10, 15
dollars.''
   The 25-year-old Reed, who sells rebuilt auto engines, said the
only item missing was a toolbox his mother-in-law had given him at
Christmas.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Sharon Reed, a 23-year-old
receptionist at a Dallas bank who added she thought the convertible
had been lost forever.
   Mark I. Barnes, owner of B&amp;D Motors in Corsicana, said he had no
idea the bug was hot when he bought it for $2,000. He said he
installed a $100 windshield but did not repair the bumpers or
fenders or repaint the car.
   He was asking for $3,200 for the car.
   Police are seeking the man who sold the car to Barnes.

   A day at the beach wasn't all sun and
sand castles for two Michigan Reformatory fugitives.
   After less than 24 hours on the lam, the pair called their
jailer, collect, and asked if they could return.
   Mark Allen Fox and Charles F. Rohn, both 19, were back behind
bars at the Ionia prison Monday, facing possible escape charges,
Warden Pamela Withrow said.
   ``They said they spent the day at the beach, they were a little
scared and hungry,'' said State Trooper Larry Medendorp. ``They
hadn't eaten at all that day.''
   The pair, along with a third inmate who remained at large,
escaped early Sunday from the prison's minimum-security dormitory,
officials said. How they escaped was under investigation.
   Prison Capt. Daniel Wilson accepted the collect call late Sunday
from Fox and Rohn, who said they were at a U.S. 131 rest stop near
Grand Rapids, about 40 miles away.
   ``They asked a bunch of questions, the kind you ask when you're
scared,'' Wilson said. ``They wanted to know what happens next, and
I said that could best be determined by what they did. ... They're
young, they had no place to go, no money.''
   Troopers picked up the two at the rest area and fed them
doughnuts and milk, Medendorp said.
   Fox was serving two to 10 years for burglary in Ogemaw County,
and Rohn was sentenced to three to 10 years in St. Clair County for
assault.
   The third inmate, Robert Parm, 19, was serving 1{ to 10 years for
larceny and burglary.
   Withrow said Monday it was unknown which beach they went to, but
police said they walked and hitchhiked most of the way in the
90-degree heat.
   Withrow also said she wasn't all that surprised the two
surrendered.
   ``At the time of orientation, they are told that if they escape
they have the responsibility to turn themselves in immediately if
they are going to claim that they were under duress,'' Withrow said.
``We like to think that portion of orientation had something to do
with it.''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court reinstated damage
suits accusing former dictator Ferdinand Marcos of ordering the
imprisonment and torture of numerous Philippine citizens.
   The suits had been dismissed by federal judges in Hawaii and
California on the grounds that Marcos' actions were ``acts of
state,'' immune from lawsuit under a doctrine that courts in one
nation cannot judge the sovereign acts of another.
   But the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals ruled last year that the ``act
of state'' doctrine did not protect a deposed ruler like Marcos,
because the doctrine's main purpose is to avoid entangling the
courts in delicate foreign policy questions.
   That ruling revived a suit by the current Philippine government,
headed by President Corazon Aquino, which accuses Marcos of looting
the Philippines during his 20-year rule and hiding his wealth abroad.
   On Monday, the court cited the same ruling in ordering the
private damage suits reinstated.
   ``The issues raised, although extraordinarily complex, are within
the capacity of the courts to resolve,'' the three-judge panel said.
   Marcos, who fled a popular uprising in the Philippines in
February 1986, lives in Hawaii and has been hospitalized with a
grave illness since January.
   Monday's ruling involved five lawsuits, three in Honolulu and two
in San Francisco, that included accusations of illegal arrest,
torture and other abuse.

<HEAD>Storms Move off Northeast Coast, Leaving Trail of Tornado Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A line of storms moved off the Northeast coast this morning after
spawning tornadoes from northern New Jersey to central Massachusetts
and leaving at least two people dead and hundreds homeless.
   At least 10 tornadoes were reported Monday in the Northeast.
   In Connecticut, the storm did heavy damage to 40 to 60 homes, a
16-unit condominium and an industrial park in the town of Hamden,
and it tore off roofs and uprooted trees in Waterbury. Twenty-seven
people in Waterbury and 37 in New Haven were treated for minor
injuries.
   The storm cut off power to more than 112,000 people in
northwestern and southern Connecticut, said spokesmen for Northeast
Utilities and United Illuminating.
   A tornado overturned cars and damaged houses in Carmel and
Southeast township, 50 miles north of New York City, and another
twister threw a trailer and a small plane at an airport in the
village of East Moriches on Long Island.
   A 12-year-old girl was killed near Waterbury, Conn., when a tree
fell on her tent at a campground; three other girls inside were
injured, one critically. A man died in New York City when he stepped
into a puddle that was electrified by exposed wires at an excavation
site.
   The thunderstorms also produced hail as large as golf balls and
wind gusts to 70 mph. Two persons were injured in Schoharie County,
N.Y.
   Showers and thunderstorms in the north-central states continued
over parts of the Dakotas, southern Minnesota and northern Iowa
early this morning. In Iowa, winds gusted to 60 mph east of Lake
Park Monday evening and high winds downed trees around Marshalltown.
   Thunderstorms also continued over western Kansas and
south-central Nebraska early today after dropped dime-size hail near
Russell Springs, Kan., Monday evening.
   Showers and a few thundershowers also were over Arizona and New
Mexico. Haze was prevalent in the Ohio Valley and the Middle
Atlantic Coast, and fair skies prevailed across the rest of the
nation.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from
northern portions of Airzona and New Mexico across the central
Rockies, the Dakotas, the upper Mississippi Valley, and the Ohio and
Tennessee valleys to the central and southern Appalachians.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms were predicted from southeastern
Texas across the lower Mississippi Valley and Gulf Coast to Florida.
Thunderstorms also were expected in western portions of the southern
Plains, and rain was forecast for northern Maine.
   Highs were expected to be in the 70s along the canadian border
from Maine to New York, and from Upper Michigan to northeast
Minnesota; the upper 60s and 70s along the Pacific Coast and across
western Washington; and above 100 degrees in the southwestern
deserts and over portions of the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.
Elsewhere, highs were forecast to be in the 80s and 90s.
   Temperatures at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 50 degrees at Burns, Ore.,
to 92 degrees at Las Vegas.

   A Taiwanese journalist, freed and deported from
China today after being held eight days, said Chinese authorities
told him they arrested a key student leader from the crushed
pro-democracy movement.
   The whereabouts of the student leader, Wang Dan, have been
unknown since he met with the journalist, Huang Teh-pei, in Beijing
on July 2. There had been unconfirmed reports of his arrest.
   Huang, a reporter for Taiwan's Independence Evening Post, told
reporters in Hong Kong that officials of the Beijing Municipal State
Security Bureau informed him of Wang's arrest after Huang himself
was detained on July 3.
   ``They told me, `Tell the truth because everyone else has been
caught, your friend Wang Dan and your driver,''' Huang said.
   Huang said he had met Wang to discuss the dissident's options for
fleeing China, but the two split up when they realized they were
being followed by security agents.Huang's driver and Wang stayed
together and were chased by the agents, he said.
   Huang also said interrogators confronted him with information
only he and his driver would know, leading him to believe that Wang
had been arrested.
   ``It's very possible it's because of me'' that the student leader
was caught, he said.
   Huang was freed ``on account of his good attitude in admitting
his guilt,'' China's official Xinhua News Agency quoted a spokesman
for the Municipal State Security Bureau as saying.
   Xinhua said Chinese authorities also considered ``the overall
interest of the relations between the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait.''
   Huang was charged with violating martial law regulations that ban
foreign, Hong Kong and Taiwanese journalists from reporting on the
political turmoil in Beijing.
   Xinhua said he ``concocted rumors, filed news stories designed to
instigate turmoil and counterrevolutionary revolt, and drew maps of
the deployment of martial law enforcement troops.''
   Xinhua also said Huang, who arrived in Beijing in June with a
tourist visa, made secret contacts July 2 with a leader of the
illegal Autonomous Student Union of Beijing Universities and planned
to assist the student in fleeing the mainland. It did not name the
student, who was presumed to be Wang.
   Since the government crackdown began last month, some leaders of
the pro-democracy movement have escaped to the West to avoid arrest.
Others have been arrested and still others are in hiding.
   Huang said that throughout his captivity, interrogators demanded
that he confess to breaking the law. He said he acknowledged most
allegations, but refused to comply when authorities ``wanted me to
say I was a spy.''
   He said he was handcuffed and forced into a car, but added,
``There was no corporal punishment, they did not hit me.''
   Huang said he would remain in Hong Kong until another reporter
from his newspaper, Hsu Lu, left Beijing. Taiwan radio said Chinese
security informed Miss Hsu early today to leave the country within
48 hours.
   The rival Nationalist government on Taiwan bans all official
contacts with the mainland but in the past two years has relaxed
restrictions on travel and visits by sports delegations and other
non-governmental groups.
   Lee Ching-hua, secretary general of Taiwan's Olympic Committee,
said Monday he had received a cable from his counterpart in China
promising an early release for Huang because ``we cherish the easing
of tension across the (Taiwan) Straits and have fully considered the
wishes of Taiwan's leaders.''
   Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed June 3-4 when troops
ran protesters out of central Beijing, crushing the student-led
pro-democracy movement.

   Mel Blanc, who entranced generations of
cartoon viewers with voices ranging from Bugs Bunny to Porky Pig,
died Monday from complication of heart disease. He was 81.
   Starting in 1937, he became part of Warner Bros.' cartoon studio,
which produced one short feature subject each week.
   Blanc was also a regular on radio's ``The Jack Benny Show.''
   His first Warner Bros. character was a drunken bull in the Looney
Tunes short ``Picador Porky.'' Blanc took over the role of Porky Pig
in ``Porky's Duck Hunt'' and created Daffy Duck.
   He introduced Bugs Bunny in the 1940 short ``A Wild Hare.''
   He invented the voices of such characters as Woody Woodpecker,
Speedy Gonzalez, Pepe Le Pew, Tasmanian Devil, Road Runner, Foghorn
Leghorn, Heathcliffe the cat, Speed Buggy, Yosemite Sam and that
Oscar-winning rabbit Bugs Bunny.
   He also did voices for Elmer Fudd, the Roadrunner and numerous
other characters he performed on 850 cartoons for Warner Bros.'
Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies.
   Blanc's last cartoon contribution came with 1988's popular
animation-live action film, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' in which he
did the voices of Daffy, Tweety, Bugs and Sylvester. He wrote an
autobiography that year, ``That's Not All, Folks: My Life in the
Golden Age of Cartoons and Radio.''

   J. Bruno Benziger Sr., co-founder of
Glen Ellen Winery, which grew rapidly in the last eight years to
become one of California's biggest wine producers, died Monday of
heart failure, the company announced. He was 64.
   After marketing modestly price wines for family-owned
import-export outfit Park, Benziger &amp; Co., Benziger moved from New
York to Sonoma County in 1981 where he planned to become a
semi-retired farmer. His son Michael, who learned winemaking in

   A government spokesman today said ousted Communist
Party chief Zhao Ziyang is still under investigation for allegedly
supporting the pro-democracy movement, and refused to rule out that
he might be put on trial.
   Yuan Mu, the only high-ranking government official who has met
with reporters since the army crushed the movement June 3-4, told a
news conference that ``at this stage'' Zhao only was accused of
making mistakes that could be dealt with within the party.
   ``However, the problem is still under investigation,'' Yuan said.
``How the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided
according to the findings of the investigation.''
   In other developments, an American reporter and a Taiwanese
journalist left China after being ordered out, and authorities gave
a second Taiwanese reporter 48 hours to leave. All were accused of
violating restrictions on reporting.
   The new party chief, Jiang Zemin, met with a group of Hong Kong
leaders this afternoon but both sides refused comment on the
discussions.
   Jiang was expected to try to reassure Hong Kong residents
frightened by the mainland crackdown that China would preserve their
capitalist system for 50 years after Britain returns the colony in
1997. However, China also has called on Hong Kong to stop supporting
fugitive pro-democracy activists.
   When the party Central Committee ousted Zhao on June 24 from the
post he held for more than two years, it accused him of ``splitting
the party'' and supporting the student-led protests for a freer
society.
   However, Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong charged in a recently
disclosed major speech that Zhao ``connived at'' and facilitated the
gradual escalation of the protests from April to June, and that his
aides collaborated with the students in efforts to overthrow the
government.
   The report stopped just short of accusing Zhao of taking part in
the alleged coup conspiracy by those under him. Such a charge would
have to be followed by a trial, which might force party leaders to
reveal details of top-level decision-making and might arouse new
anti-party sentiment.
   Although Zhao did not enjoy wide personal popularity, he has
become a symbol of the crushed reformist camp.
   Only senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who once sponsored Zhao's rise
to power, could make the crucial decision of putting him on trial.
   The last time a top official was accused of plotting a coup in
China was in 1976, when moderates and generals arrested the radical
Gang of Four that led the Cultural Revolution. They were put on
public trial in 1980 and are serving life sentences.
   Recent official media reports also have accused Zhao of serious
ideological mistakes, including de-emphasizing the role of the
proletariat and neglecting party building.
   At his news conference, Yuan blamed Zhao for the endemic
corruption within party ranks, saying that under his leadership the
fight against corruption was relaxed.
   Yuan said martial law, imposed in central Beijing on May 20,
could not be lifted yet because ``the struggle has not ended. Some
guns still remain in society and that will be a cause of further
unrest.''
   He insisted, however, that foreign tourists and businessmen could
consider Beijing secure and said it would be unwise to make lifting
of martial law a condition for returning to the city.
   Thousands of Chinese-based foreign businessmen and their families
fled Beijing in the week after the army cleared central Beijing of
protesters, killing hundreds. Most have yet to return.
   Many joint venture companies, which provide capital and
technology China needs badly to modernize, remain virtually shut
down or operate at much reduced levels.
   ``Of course there will be a time limit for martial law, but even
I can't say exactly when that will be,'' Yuan said. He said it would
be lifted ``when things have completely returned to normal and when
we feel that all the problems of the rebellion that need to be
resolved have been.''
   He said sanctions imposed by some Western countries to protest
the crackdown ``will cause some temporary trouble'' for China's
ailing economy. Among the problems are inflation that Yuan said was
running at 25.5 percent in the first half of the year, and growing
budget and trade deficits.
   ``But the Chinese people will not yield to these pressures
because of these troubles,'' he said. ``On the contrary, it will
inspire a spirit of plain living and hard struggle and relying on
our own efforts. So in the long run it will do our country good.''
   Yuan refused to disclose figures for the number of people
arrested since the crackdown began. The Associated Press has counted
more than 2,000 arrests nationwide according to official media
reports, but Chinese sources said that many were believed to have
been arrested in the capital alone.
   China today expelled a Taiwanese reporter who was arrested a week
ago after he reported meeting with a key fugitive student leader.
   Huang Teh-pei of the Independence Evening Post said after
arriving in Hong Kong that authorities told him they had arrested
the student, Wang Dan.
   The Ministry of State Security ordered a second Independence
Evening Post reporter, Hsu Lu, to leave within 48 hours, the
People's Broadcasting Station said. It said she was accused of
violating martial law, conducting illegal interviews and filing
distorted reports.
   A reporter for the U.S.-run Voice of America, Mark Hopkins, also
flew to Hong Kong today after being accused of violating martial
law. He was the second VOA reporter and the seventh Western reporter
ordered out since the crackdown.

<HEAD>Defense Rests in `Night Stalker' Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense rested its case in the ``Night
Stalker'' mass murder trial after presenting a photograph of
defendant Richard Ramirez that they say proves he couldn't have
committed two of the attacks.
   The string of slayings terrorized Southern California four years
ago.
   Ramirez's lawyers entered into evidence Monday a blown-up color
photograph of Ramirez they say is evidence he was in Texas at the
time of two of the attacks.
   The lawyers contend the photo of Ramirez with his parents and a
niece was taken on May 25, 1985, the day of his niece's first
communion in El Paso, Texas.
   The suspect's father, Julian Ramirez Tapia, testified earlier
that his son arrived two days before the event and stayed for eight
days, placing him out of town when the attacks occurred.
   Earlier prosecution testimony had linked Ramirez to the murder of
Mabel Bell and the attempted murder of her roommate between May 29
and June 1, 1985, and the rape of another woman on May 30, 1985.
   Ramirez's sister-in-law, Maria Torres, testified Monday that she
saw Ramirez in El Paso on May 25 and May 29, 1985. She said she
remembered because May 29 was ``the one-month anniversary after I
separated from my husband.''
   Raymundo Pantoja, a friend of Ramirez's father, also testified
that he saw Ramirez on May 25, 1985.
   The defense's contention that Ramirez was a victim of mistaken
identity was challenged during the trial by prosecution witnesses,
including a local dentist who said he treated Ramirez on May 30,
1985.
   Ramirez is charged with 13 murders and 30 other felonies in
connection with the noctural attacks.
   The 29-year-old drifter and self-described devil worshipper was
arrested Aug. 31, 1985, after a crowd of East Los Angeles residents
recognized him from news photographs and captured him as he
allegedly tried to steal a car.
   Closing arguments were scheduled for Wednesday.

<HEAD>Shamir May Try to Rescue Government With New Peace Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir may try to keep
his governing coalition from collapsing by proposing a new Cabinet
vote on Israel's plan for seeking peace with the Palestinians, his
spokesman said today.
   The Labor Party, partner of Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc in the
coalition, has threatened to quit the Cabinet and force new national
elections.
   In a resolution passed Monday by its 120-member Leadership
Bureau, Labor accused Likud of torpedoing chances of starting peace
talks and added ``there is no room under these circumstances for the
continuation of the government.''
   Labor's decision came in response to the tough new conditions
adopted by Likud on the proposal for elections in the occupied
territories.
   A Labor pullout would require ratification by its decision-making
Central Committee, which was expected to meet within three weeks.
   Shamir's peace plan proposes that 1.7 million Palestinians in the
occupied territories elect representatives to talks with Israel
about an interim period of limited self-rule in these areas. The
final status of the territories would be decided in later talks.
   Likud hard-liners subsquently toughened the plan with more
conditions, including a demand that elections be delayed pending an
end to the 19-month Palestinian uprising in the disputed lands and
that Arabs in east Jerusalem be barred from voting.
   Likud also called for the continued construction of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and said it would never
agree to Palestinian statehood in these areas.
   Despite the tensions that Likud's program has generated, some
Israeli analysts have predicted the dispute could be resolved before
Labor convenes its Central Committee.
   ``The time lapse can give Shamir and his allies breathing space
to erase the results of Likud's meeting,'' Political commentator
Akiva Eldar wrote in the Haaretz daily.
   Shamir was making efforts to placate Labor, and was considering a
new vote on the peace plan which could remove the party's rationale
for leaving the government, Haaretz and four other newspapers said
in front-page stories.
   The news reports said the vote would likely be on a proposal put
forward by Industry Minister Ariel Sharon calling for adding to the
peace initiative the hard-line conditions that Likud adopted as
party policy.
   The Cabinet would likely defeat the proposals, reinforcing the
peace plan without condtions, the Israeli newspapers said. The
Cabinet first passed the plan by a 20-6 vote in May.
   Ahimeir, Shamir's spokesman, confirmed in a telephone interview
that Sharon's proposals for a Cabinet vote were on the premier's
desk.
   ``You could say that the prime minister's office should be
interested in holding such a vote,'' Ahimeir said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III referred to the Likud
principles as ``not helpful'' last week and said Monday he wanted
assurances about Israel's intentions.
   Likud and Labor formed their governing coalition in December.

<TEXT>
   More than 25,000 people, many fearful of life in
this British colony when it reverts to Chinese rule, flocked today
to take advantage of a new policy in Singapore relaxing immigration
requirements.
   Thousands more were turned away because of the huge crush of
people.
   Communist China's suppression of its student-led movement for
democracy has sparked fears among many of Hong Kong's 5.7 million
people of their fate when Britain returns the colony to Chinese rule
in 1997.
   More than 45,000 people emigrated from the colony last year, and
this year even more are expected to leave.
   A line of about 10,000 people, standing five abreast, stretched
for blocks in downtown Hong Kong when officials at Singapore
Management Corp. decided to stop handing out applications for
permanent residence in Singapore.
   The government-owned company, set up several years ago to entice
well-educated and rich Hong Kong residents to Singapore, said that
from now on it only would accept applications by mail.
   The crush at the company came one day after Singapore announced
it was relaxing requirements for Hong Kong residents to become
permanent residents in the republic.
   Britain has said repeatedly that it will not give Hong Kong's
people the right to live in Britain, causing many to look elsewhere
for a haven.
   Michael Lim, general manager of the Singapore company, said an
``overwelming demand for application forms'' forced the company to
close its offices.
   ``In the interest of public safety, we have decided to close the
booth ... and ask applicants to apply by post,'' Lim said.
   Another spokesman for the company said today that 15,000
application forms for permanent residency had been handed out before
the offices were shut down. Police said about 10,000 people were
turned away and that there were no incidents of violence.
   Singapore's new permanent residence plan lowers educational and
monetary prerequisites.
   The previous plan was limited to those with a university degree
or the professional equivalent and enterpreneurs willing to invest
$512,000 in Singapore.
   Now, any workers with at least five years of employment will be
allowed to apply as well businessmen who invest less than $500,000
provided their businesses are approved by the Economic Development
Board.
   Singapore has decided to liberalize its rules to compete with
developed countries in recruiting skilled workers, technicians and
professionals.
   ``Singapore's growing economy requires more such people than are
being produced domestically,'' said a statement from the Singapore
government. ``This liberalization applies to immigrants from all
sources, whatever their ethnic background, so long as they can be
integrated into Singapore society without upsetting the present
balance in its multiracial character.''
   Still, it is significant that most of the applicants were
expected to be ethnic Chinese.
   Of Singapore's 2.6 million people, 76 percent are Chinese, 15
percent Malays, 6 percent Indians and the rest Eurasians and
Europeans.

   A judge threw out the criminal conviction
of a Navy veteran whose flapping American flag bothered a neighbor
after the man agreed to put up a quieter, cotton flag.
   ``The flag is not making any noise any more ever since he put up
a cotton flag,'' Assistant City Attorney Stephen Ryan told District
Judge Joe Galvan in asking that the case be dismissed.
   Galvan tossed out the conviction on Monday, wiping Lee Bach's
record clean. He had been convicted of violating the city's noise
law three weeks ago after a neighbor complained that Bach's nylon
flag was too noisy on windy days.
   ``It's unfortunate that something as important and sacred to all
of us as the American flag should create turmoil in the community,''
Galvan said.
   ``I'm satisfied,'' Bach said afterward, although he said he still
may fly his nylon flag on occasion. Most of the 100 people in court
applauded Galvan's ruling.

   A letter carrier has been charged with delaying
delivery of more than 2{ tons of mail and stashing it in his home
and yard for years.
   John Cade surrendered Monday and appeared for a preliminary
hearing on charges of delaying mail and theft of postal property
before U.S. Magistrate Richard Harvey, who set a $5,000 unsecured
bond.
   Some 6,550 pounds of mail was discovered at Cade's home in
Boulder after someone reported a carrier dumping mail into a trash
receptacle at the residence, said an affidavit by Postal Inspector
Lee Morris.
   Two postal supervisors found more than 200 pieces of mail in the
trash and observed piles in the yard. Cade admitted putting the mail
at his residence and agreed to allow officers to search the home and
recover the mail, the affidavit said.
   Most of the mail is bulk business mail and is undeliverable and
authorities are considering some way to reimburse the senders for
their loss, said John Freeman, chief postal inspector for Denver.
   Cade's cluttered house and yard contained thousands of pieces of
mail, including first-, second-, third- and fourth-class mail,
according to the court document.
   A preliminary hearing in the case was set for July 26.

   Troops have arrested 1,000 suspected
Sinhalese extremists during raids on insurgent hideouts in the
capital and three central districts, the government said today.
   The troops recovered land mines, guns, ammunition and military
uniforms during the raids on Sunday and Monday, an Information
Department statement said.
   A short-wave band radio transmitter also was confiscated in the
southern Hungama town, 85 miles south of Colombo, the statement said.
   Besides Colombo, the operations were carried out in the districts
of Badulla, Kandy and Moneragala, it said. The suspects were
detained for questioning, it said. No further details were given.
   The raids were part of a government crackdown on members of the
left-wing People's Liberation Front, who have been fighting to
topple President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government.
   The Sinhalese extremists began their anti-government campaign two
years ago to protest peace overtures made to Tamil rebels. The
Sinhalese militants said too many concessions to the minority Tamils
were made in an Indian-Sri Lankan peace accord that tried to end the
Tamil rebellion.
   The Sinhalese front is also believed to have sponsored a
crippling one-month transport workers' strike.
   Transport Minister Wijepala Mendis said Monday the strike by the
40,000 workers of the state-owned public transport company had been
broken. He said ``a fair percentage'' of workers reported for duty
after the government announced that strikers would be arrested.
   In an attempt to crush civil unrest, Premadasa imposed a
nationwide state of emergency June 20, giving security forces wide
powers to arrest and detain without legal obligations.
   On Thursday, the government said it ordered troops and police to
shoot saboteurs and those putting up anti-government posters. A
censorship campaign was also imposed the same day.
   The Sinhalese extremists also have protested the presence of
Indian troops, invited to maintain the Indian-Sri Lankan accord and
break the Tamil rebellion, saying it compromised the country's
independence.
   Premadasa's request to India to withdraw the troops has failed to
appease the Sinhalese radicals.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
allege discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who
constitute 75 percent of the population and control the government
and the military.

<DATELINE>ELIZABETH, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of killing his wife, mother
and three children 18 years ago pleaded innocent at his arraignment
and bail was set at $5 million.
   Hundreds of curiosity seekers, many with strong memories of the
macabre 1971 killings in a Westfield mansion, packed the Union
County courtroom for a look at the man arrested in Virginia on a tip
from a television viewer.
   The man authorities say is John E. List, 63, pleaded innocent
Monday to five counts of murder.
   The man, who says he is Robert P. Clark, did not speak during the
10-minute hearing. He was handcuffed and clad in prison-issue khaki
pants and shirt and wore brown plastic slippers.
   Superior Court Judge William Wertheimer set a trial date for Dec.
4.
   Clark's attorney, Elijah Miller, deputy chief of the county
Public Defender's Office, said prosecutors must prove his client is
List.
   ``Robert Clark is the name he was extradited under, is the name
he's listed under in jail,'' he said. ``The state is trying to prove
he is someone else.''
   Clark was arrested June 1 in Richmond, Va., on a tip from a
viewer of the national television program, ``America's Most
Wanted,'' which 11 days earlier had run a segment focusing on List.
   Officials say List, an accountant and devout Lutheran known for
his meticulousness and mild manners, killed his family because he
believed it was the only way to save them from leading a life of
sin. They say fingerprints and a scar prove List and Clark are the
same man.
   The bodies of List's wife, Helen, 45, and their children,
Patricia, 16, John Jr. 15, and Frederick, 13, were not found until a
month after the deaths, laid side-by-side in the ballroom of their
19-room mansion. The body of his 85-year-old mother, Alma, was
discovered in an upstairs bedroom.

<HEAD>Palestinian Shot Dead in Gangland-Style Attack</HEAD>

   Two men masked with Arab kaffiyeh scarves killed
a 28-year-old Palestinian in a shooting today on a downtown street
in the occupied Gaza Strip, witnesses said.
   Also today, an American woman injured in a bus crash blamed on a
Palestinian joined the Israeli government in calling for the United
States to declare it an act of terrorism.
   The army said the Gaza Strip slaying was carried out by
Palestinians and is under investigation. It comes amid increasing
attacks by Palestinians on fellow Arabs accused of collaborating
with Israeli authorities.
   In the West Bank, a general strike was called in Ramallah and
El-Bireh to protest the shooting deaths of three Palestinian youths
by Israeli army and security agents Monday, Arab reports said.
   ``Killing our people will not stop the intefadeh!'' slogans
painted on walls in the towns north of Jerusalem declared today,
using the Arabic term for the 19-month uprising against Israeli
occupation.
   A military spokesman confirmed two West Bank deaths and said the
army is checking the third report.
   The deaths around Ramallah would bring the toll to 558
Palestinians killed in the revolt. Thirty-five Israelis also have
been killed.
   In Gaza City, car painter Faqar Mohammed Hassan was gunned down
by two masked attackers who got out of a white car and, without
warning, pumped at least eight shots into the victim's face and
chest, witnesses said.
   The victim was not known to be involved in political activities,
but two of his brothers are in jail for being members of the
outlawed Moslem fundamentalist organization Islamic Jihad, Arab
reports said.
   The U.S. victim of the bus attack, Pella Fingersh of Kansas City,
Kan., made her appeal at a news conference arranged by the Foreign
Ministry, which has been pressing for Washington to make a stronger
statement on the bus attack.
   ``It pains me to think that America did not say this is a
terrorist attack,'' said Mrs. Fingersh, 47.
   Fourteen people were killed and 27 injured Thursday when police
said Abdel Hadi Ghanem grabbed the steering wheel and forced the bus
into a deep ravine.
   Police say they believe Ghanem, 23, acted on his own. He
reportedly told investigators he wanted to avenge a brother's
beating by Israeli soldiers.
   The U.S. State Department on Friday called the incident tragic
and senseless.
   Today, U.S. Embassy spokesman Donald Cofman said in Tel Aviv that
the State Department since has decided the incident fits its
definition of terror as ``premeditated, politically motivated
violence directed against civilians.''' An Israeli court meanwhile
convicted a teen-age Palestinian girl of manslaughter in the fatal
shooting of a teen-age Jewish seminary student in a Jerusalem park
on June 2, 1988, Israel radio reported today.
   It quoted the girl, unidentified because she is a minor, as
telling the court she attacked the Israeli to gain acceptance in
Arab society where she was rejected because she had Israeli friends.
Sentencing was delayed.

   Here are excerpts from Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa's remarks introducing President Bush at the Solidarity
workers monument Tuesday. Walesa spoke in Polish.
   Ladies and gentleman, I have lived for 25 years in Gdansk and I
have never seen anything like this. ... On behalf of all of you,
tired with waiting, I would like to welcome, Mr. President of the
United States, his wife and all of the guests present here.
   Mr. President, we are here today standing at the place which for
Poles is a special one. We are grateful to you, Mr. President. We
are grateful to Mrs. Bush and all the American officials who have
come here to the monument of fallen shipyard workers, those who fell
for bread and freedom.
   A dramatic challenge of fate has caused that this place where one
man shot another, where when men shot men, is the place where
Solidarity was born.
   You are aware, Mr. President, of our tangled and difficult route
which hasn't run its course yet, for we continually keep facing very
difficult tasks.
   If the bends in that road ... have not discouraged us from
action, this happened to a large extent thanks to our conviction
that we were not alone, that we can count on our friends and their
solidarity with us.
   We have found ourselves today in a situation in which political
reform was necessary because a slave never makes a good worker.
   And also for another reason: because today's progress of
civilization cannot develop in an atmosphere of restraining monopoly.
   So, we're shaking off that ugly hump of totalitarian Stalinism,
and we're trying to catch up with the rest of Europe and the whole
developed world which is getting farther and farther away from us.
   We are heading towards democracy and pluralism. But all this
makes it necessary for us to keep in mind the proportions that must
exist between the reforms in the economic sphere and those in the
political sphere.
   Changes must occur at the same time in both of these fields, at
the same time and equally. The experience of China has taught us a
lesson: if the proportions are not respected, we will not be able to
succeed. ...
   If we want our square, the square of Solidarity where we are now,
to be kept in the memory of generations forever as a place of hope,
we must all work together to make sure that economic changes follow
closely those in the political field.
   The people who are standing around the monument today are good
workers, just as the millions of Poles, Polish men and women in the
United States as well as the whole of Europe, are trying to help and
have an influence through their economic policy the course of our
reforms.
   It can have millions of hands removed from useless work to hve
solid, sane, healthy, economically healthy cooperation to proceed,
and competition between our enterprises, and, finally, it can help
the lack of an effective economic reform, it can prevent it from
destabilizing this part of the world.
   This would be a threat to Poland as well as to other countries.
It would be a failure of democracy.
   I attempted to present this point of view orally and in writing
to you, Mr. President. I'm expressing my hope and the hope of
millions of Poles that you will leave Poland convinced that our
country is worthy of your help and should be helped.
   I truly believe that the links between our nations will gain a
new stimulus, and that more than ever before, Solidarity will become
a challenge to Poles and Americans. God bless America and God bless
our homeland.

<HEAD>Two Israeli Soldiers Wounded in Guerrilla Ambush</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 2 grafs to UPDATE with Israel reinforcing security.
Picks up 2nd graf, `The patrol ....'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HASBAYA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guerrillas ambushed an Israeli army
patrol in south Lebanon early today and two soldiers were wounded in
a firefight that was followed by an Israeli artillery barrage, army
and security sources said.
   Israel later bolstered its forces in south Lebanon with about 150
soldiers in a mechanized force armed with tanks and armored cars,
howitzers and surface-to-air missiles, the sources said. Troops also
sealed all four gateways linking Israel's buffer zone in south
Lebanon to the rest of the nation, they said.
   The patrol came under fire in the Hasbaya region on the northern
edge of Israel's self-declared security zone, said one security
source on condition of anonymity.
   ``The two wounded soldiers were evacuted by an Israeli helicopter
under the cover of heavy artillery barrage,'' the source said.
   An army spokesman in Jerusalem said one soldier was wounded
slightly, the other moderately. No casualties were reported among
the guerrillas, whom the source would not identify.
   The army fired more than 400 rounds of artillery into areas north
of the zone, the heaviest barrage in years, security sources said.
The barrage was aimed at areas around the towns of Hasbaya and
Maidoun, they said.
   The army spokesman in Jerusalem said the fighting occurred north
of the security zone and came during the army's second thrust
outside of the zone in two days.
   Sources in south Lebanon said, however, that the fight apparently
broke out as the army withdrew from the first operation, a raid
against Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem militia backed by Iran.
   Israeli troops and their allies in the South Lebanon Army militia
had raided guerrilla hideouts around the village of Dellaya, three
miles north of the buffer zone, killing three guerrillas.
   The three-hour raid was triggered by an attack on the zone
earlier in the day by Palestinian and leftist Lebanese guerrillas.
   The Lebanese reports said the attacking guerrillas were from two
Palestinian factions, the Popular Struggle Front and the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Syrian Socialist
Nationalist Party, a leftist Lebanese militia.
   Israel retained control over the 6-to-10-mile-deep buffer zone in
1985, as it withdrew from Lebanon, to protect its northern border
from guerrilla attacks.

   For nearly five months, police waited
outside a rehabilitation center room for Miriam Stoltz-Gurney to say
who killed her friend, shot her in the head and left her to die in
the woods.
   Last week, she remembered and pointed the finger at her
ex-husband.
   Police arrested George Gurney, 52, and charged him with
first-degree murder, kidnapping and attempted murder. He is accused
of killing Roger Whittemore, 52, of Swampscott, Mass., and taking
his ex-wife prisoner on Feb. 16.
   State Attorney General John Arnold said Gurney, of Newburyport,
Mass., had been a suspect from the outset.
   Gurney denies the shootings and is fighting extradition from
Massachusetts. But New Hampshire authorities are confident he'll be
in their custody soon.
   At a district court hearing Friday in Lawrence, Mass., Gurney
pleaded innocent to being a fugitive from the New Hampshire charges.
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Ramsdell credits
Stoltz-Gurney's willpower for her recovery from near death.
   ``Her recovery has been incredible,'' he said. ``After being in a
coma for one week, she has steadily progressed to the point where
she was able to talk about the incidents that led to the shootings.''
   Gurney said he was at home ill with a sinus condition the night
Stoltz-Gurney claims he burst into her bedroom wearing camouflage
fatigues and leather boots. He also denies owning camouflage
clothing.
   ``Everybody believes her story because she's the heroine,''
Gurney said in a jailhouse interview with the Lawrence (Mass.)
Eagle-Tribune, where he worked as an advertising salesman until his
arrest Thursday. ``I'm glad for her that she's doing so well, but I
just don't know why she's saying it was me. It was not me.''
   During her treatment at a Salem rehabilitation center, police
posted a 24-hour guard and kept her whereabouts secret while they
waited for the 48-year-old Windham resident to slowly recover her
memory.
   On July 2, she told police Gurney shot the couple.
   Friends said Stoltz-Gurney and Whittemore had planned on going
out to dinner but stayed in because of bad weather.
   According to court records, Stoltz-Gurney said Gurney confronted
them in her bedroom at 11:30 p.m. on Feb. 15. But instead of using a
rifle he had brought with him, he grabbed her .22-caliber handgun
from a bedstand.
   She said he covered Whittemore's head with a pillowcase, tied his
hands and forced them downstairs into the living room. She said
Gurney beat Whittemore with fireplace tongs before shooting him.
   Whittemore's partly clothed body was found two days later in her
back yard.
   After Gurney shot Whittemore, she said, her ex-husband forced her
at gunpoint into her car. They drove to the woods where the last
thing she remembers was another gunshot.
   A man jogging with his dog found her lying in a pool of blood
that afternoon.
   An art teacher in the Haverhill, Mass., school system, she
married Gurney in 1980. The couple divorced six years later. Friends
said she met Whittemore about eight years ago when she bought a car
from him.
   Mona Spaulding, Gurney's landlord, said Gurney and Stoltz-Gurney
behaved as though they were still married when Stoltz-Gurney visited.
   ``I know George was very much in love with her,'' she said. ``It
would energize him every time he knew she would be visiting. He'd
prepare the porch area for a romantic, candlelight dinner.''
   They exchanged Valentine's Day cards just before the shooting,
Ms. Spaulding said.
   ``I had no idea until recently that the two were divorced,'' she
said. ``He said they loved each other but couldn't live together.''
   But Gurney characterized the relationship as platonic.
   ``They're talking like this was some kind of fatal attraction,''
he said. ``She confided in me and about the men in her life. She
came to me for advice about them. ... I'm not denying there was
jealousy when the breakup first happened, but it's been watered down
over the years.''
   Gurney said he doesn't doubt parts of her story.
   ``But she's got the wrong guy,'' he added.

   Here is the transcript of President Bush's
speech Tuesday at the Solidarity Workers Monument outside the Lenin
shipyard.
   Hello, Lech Walesa. Hello to Solidarnosc. Hello, Polska. And
congratulations on what you've done since I last visited, the first
free elections in modern Polska.
   Poland has a special place in the American heart and in my heart,
and when you hurt we feel pain, and when you dream we feel hope, and
when you succeed we feel joy. It goes far beyond diplomatic
relations, it's more like family relations. And coming to Poland is
like coming home.
   This special kinship is the kinship of an ancient dream, a
recurring dream, the dream of freedom.
   ``They are accustomed to liberty,'' wrote a Byzantine historian
about the Slavic people more than 1000 years ago, and the spirit of
the Poles has been conveyed across the centuries and across the
ocean, a dream that would not die.
   That dream was severely tested here in Gdansk 50 years ago this
summer. The pre-dawn quiet of this peaceful Baltic harbor was
shattered by the thunder from the 15-inch guns of Nazi warship
Schleswig Holstein. Within the hour, iron Panzers rolled across the
Polish frontier and Europe was plunged into darkness that would
engulf the world.
   For Poland the choices were few, surrender to tyranny or resist
against impossible odds. And in the brutal fighting that followed,
you set a standard for courage that will never be forgotten.
   In World War II Poland lost everything except her honor, except
her dreams. Before Poland fell you gave the Allies Enigma, the
Nazi's secret coding machine. Breaking the unbreakable Axis code
saved tens of thousands of Allied lives, of American lives, and for
this you have the enduring gratitude of the American people. And
ultimately, Enigma and freedom fighters played a major role in
winning the Second World War.
   But for you the war's end did not end the darkness. The Cold War
brought a long and chilly night of sorrow and hardship and the dream
was again denied. And yet there were glimmers of the long awaited
dawn.
   In the summer of 1980, you occupied the shipyards where we stand
and a patriotic electrician clambered over these iron gates and
emerged as one of the heroes of our times, Lech Walesa.
   And above your streets a graceful momument rose in the tradition
of our own Statue of Liberty to become a symbol recognized around
the world as a beacon of hope.
   But the hope, like the dawn, proved fleeting, for under cover of
darkness the electrician was arrested and your movement outlawed.
And in the icy cold of a savage winter, a modern nation was sealed
off from the outside world.
   But still, the dream would not die.
   In the wintry darkness, candles appeared in silent protest,
lighting the windows of your villages, of your cities. And as the
years unfolded and as the world watched in wonder, you, the Polish
people and your leaders, turned despair into hope, turned darkness
into dreams.
   Hope and hard work were the foundations of Poland's resurrection
as a state in 1918. Against enormous odds, confidence and
determination made that dream a reality. And these same qualities
have brought you to this new crossroads in history.
   Your time has come. It is Poland's time of possibilities, its
time of responsibilities.
   It is Poland's time of destiny, a time when dreams can live again
_ Solidarity reborn; productive negotiations between the government
of Poland and the Polish people; and the first fruits of democracy,
elections.
   At another time, in another city, where the human spirit was
being tested, a great American president spoke eloquently about the
struggle for liberty.
   Today, the world watches the inevitable outcome of that struggle.
   Today, to those who think that hope can be forever suppressed, I
say let them look at Poland.
   To those who think that freedom can be forever denied, I say let
them look at Poland.
   And to those who think that dreams can be forever repressed, I
say let them look at Poland. For here in Poland, the dream is alive.

   A stolen single-engine plane struck a
power line and crashed early today, killing its 24-year-old pilot
who apparently was on a joyride, authorities said.
   The Cessna 152, which had taken off from Arlington Municipal
Airport with authorities in pursuit, crashed about 2 a.m. south of
Interstate 20 and about 100 yards from a housing development.
   ``He didn't know how to fly,'' said airport night manager Tom
Penalver. ``You could tell when he took off.''
   The plane was stolen from Cothron Aviation Inc. The pilot,
identified as William Stacy, had been arrested previously for
stealing a Cothron plane for a joyride in October 1987, said
Arlington Police spokesman Dee Anderson.
   ``We had had a case of this kid stealing a plane from the same
place before. He had taken flying lessons from these people
before,'' Anderson said.
   Officer Desmond Freeman said the plane struck power lines but
added that police did not know if the impact was a factor in the
crash.
   ``I could tell at the time it took off it was a stolen aircraft.
I chased it down the field. It was going down the taxiway,'' said
Penalver.
   Penalver said the plane nearly nosed into airport officials. The
pilot ``kept circling around, (we were) on the radio trying to bring
him in. He obviously didn't have his radio on.''
   He said the pilot had been flying around the airport for about
one hour before the crash, making about a dozen attempts to land at
the airport.
   Penalver said he was checking out runway lights about 1 a.m. when
he noticed a car driven behind a hangar and he called police.
   ``A few minutes later, the aircraft taxied out,'' he said. ``It
drove down the taxiway, adjacent to the runway, and we followed him
as he took off.
   Penalver said the pilot then tried to land.
   ``He touched the runway,'' said Penalver. ``Most of the time, he
was scared to touch down. I thought it was a student who didn't know
how to land in a crosswind.''
   Penalver said the plane crashed southeast of the airport.
   ``He wanted to fly,'' Penalver said. ``He learned how to fly the
hard way. He had fun _ for awhile.''

   Yes, today brave workers of Gdansk stand beside this monument as
a beacon of hope, a symbol of that dream. And the brave workers of
Gdansk know Poland is not alone. America stands with you.
   Because Americans are so free to dream, we feel a special kinship
with those who dream of a better future.
   Here in Poland, the United States supports the roundtable accords
and applauds the wisdom, tenacity and patience of one of Poland's
great leaders, Lech Walesa.
   And we share a movement that has touched the imagination of the
world. That movement is Solidarnosc. And we applaud those who have
made this progress possible, the Polish people.
   We recognize, too, that the Polish government has shown wisdom
and creativity and courage in proceeding with these historic steps.
   Poles and Americans share a commitment to overcome the division
of Europe and to redeem the promise that is the birthright of men
and women throughout the world. Poles and Americans want Europe to
be whole and free.
   A more democratic Poland can be a more prosperous Poland. The
roundtable provisions, as they continue to be carried out, can
liberate the energy of a dynamic people to work together to build a
better life.
   We understand the legacy of distrust and shattered dreams as
Poles of all political complexions travel together down the path of
negotiation and compromise. Your challenge is to rise above distrust
and bring the Polish people together toward a common purpose.
   Speaking before the new Parliament and the Senate, your freely
elected Senate, I outlined steps that America is prepared to take to
assist Poland as you move forward on the path of reform.
   It will not be easy. Sacrifice and economic hardship have already
been the lot of the Polish people, and hard times are not yet at an
end.
   Economic reform requires hard work and restraint before the
benefits are realized, and it requires patience and determination.
But, the Polish people are no strangers to hard work, and have
taught the world about determination.
   So, I say follow your dream of a better life for you and your
children. You can see a new and prosperous Poland, not overnight,
not in a year, but yes, a new and prosperous Poland in your lifetime.
   It's been done by Polish people before. Hopeful immigrants came
to that magical place called America and built a new life for
themselves in a single generation, and it can be done by Polish
people again, but this time it will be done in Poland.
   Just before I left a few days ago, I was asked in my beautiful
Oval Office in the White House by one of your journalists, ``If I
would leave Poland and go to America, were I a young Pole?''
   And I answered that in this time of bright promise, of historic
transition, of unique opportunity, I would want to stay in Poland
and be a part of it _ help make the dream come true for all the
Polish people.
   (The crowd chanted: ``Stay with us!'')
   The magic of America is not found in the majesty of her land _
and yes our country has been blessed; but Poland, too, is a land of
natural beauty, ample timber and ore and water and coal, abundant
agriculture potential, and a talented, creative people that is
determined to succeed.
   No, the magic of America is in an idea. I described it in my
first moments as president of the United States.
   We know what works: freedom works. We know what's right: freedom
is right.
   We know how to secure a more just and prosperous land for man on
earth, and today you can rediscover a new land, a land of your
dreams; a land of your own making; a Poland strong and proud.
   Poland is where World War II began, and Poland is where and why
the Cold War got started, and it is here, in Poland where we can
work to end the division of Europe.
   It is in your power to help end the division of Europe. I can
think of no finer or more capable people with whom to entrust this
mission.
   And just as the son of Poland has shown the world the heights of
spiritual leadership in the Vatican, so the people of Poland can
show the world what a free people with commitment and energy can
accomplish.
   A new century is almost upon us. It is alive with possibilities.
And in your quest for a better future for yourselves and for those
wonderful children that I saw coming in from the airport, in that
quest America stands shoulder to shoulder with the Polish people in
solidarity.
   Americans and Poles both know that nothing can stop an idea whose
time has come. The dream is a Poland reborn, and the dream is alive.
Poland is not lost while Poles still live.
   I came here to assure you we will help Poland! Goodbye, God bless
you, and God save this wonderful country of Poland.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is willing to consider a U.S.
proposal for trial inspections of strategic nuclear weapons, a
government official said today.
   Lt. Gen. Konstantin F. Mikhailov, first deputy chief of the
Foreign Ministry's Arms Limitation and Disarmament Administration,
told reporters the suggestion was in line with Soviet policy on
other issues.
   ``A similar proposal was proposed (by us) for monitoring heavy
bombers hardware, and if you have in mind the experiment for
monitoring strategic nuclear weapons, we are prepared to discuss
this question,'' Mikhailov told a regular Foreign Ministry news
briefing.
   Mikhailov commented in response to a question about Deputy
Foreign Minister Viktor P. Karpov's remarks in a Washington Post
interview that Moscow could accept U.S. proposals for trial
inspections of nuclear weapons systems as long as more weapons are
covered.
   Karpov, who was a chief negotiator at Geneva arms control talks,
also was quoted as saying the Soviets would consider limits on
multi-warhead mobile missiles.
   Karpov, in a Moscow interview reported in today's editions of the
Washington newspaper, said such inspections ``should not prevent the
normal development of negotiations in Geneva or be a precondition
for work on the draft text and protocols. They should go hand in
hand.''
   But Karpov said the Soviets want to include more weapons systems
than were envisioned in the U.S. proposal put forward in the
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks in Geneva last month for monitoring
experiments while the negotiations are under way.
   U.S. officials reportedly have wanted to confine the experiments
to silo-based missiles and mobile strategic missiles. Karpov,
however, was quoted as saying cruise missiles and bomber bases
should be included.
   The first monitoring should be of sea-launched cruise missiles,
``one of the areas where the most difficult verification problems
arise,'' he said. He also suggested inspectors might visit each
other's cruise missile factories.
   Although the United States proposed continuous monitoring of
entrances and exits of plants producing mobile strategic missiles,
it has no such plants of its own.
   However, the Bush administration has proposed putting the
10-warhead MX missile on rail cars and the proposed single-warhead
Midgetman on mobile land transporters.
   Karpov said, ``If we can have inspectors at production plants for
the MX or the Midgetman, then we would be ready to have such a team
at our plant'' producing the multi-warhead SS-24, a mobile missile.
   Asked if the Soviets would consider banning or sharply limiting
such missiles, Karpov said, ``I think that can be considered.''
   He said the Soviet Union might also accept a ban on nuclear
cruise missiles of any range, instead of numerical limits on the
long-range strategic variety it has put forward, ``if we can find
efficient means to carry out the elimination of tactical nuclear
weapons in a way that won't harm U.S. and Soviet security
interests.''

   Rebels claim the Ethiopian government has
rounded up and executed more than 480 alleged participants in an
attempted coup in May.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast, the Eritrean People's
Liberation Front also said 230 other people, mostly soldiers, had
been imprisoned for taking part in the failed coup.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nairobi on Monday night, said 40 of
those killed had been high-ranking officers of Ethiopia's 2nd Army,
based in northern Eritrea Province.
   In a news conference in Addis Ababa last month, President
Mengistu Haile Mariam said about 190 officers and soldiers had been
either killed or imprisoned during and after the coup.
   Eritrean rebels have been fighting for more than a
quarter-century for a separate homeland.

   Laurence Olivier, the foremost actor of his
generation and leader of the giants of the English-speaking theater,
died today. He was 82.
   He died ``peacefully in his sleep,'' surrounded by friends and
relatives, said his agent, Laurence Evans. The cause of death was
not given.
   Olivier's last professional appearance was in the 1988 movie
``War Requiem,'' based on the oratorio by composer Benjamin Britten.
   He was to be buried in a private funeral service, with a public
memorial service to be held later, Evans said.
   Knighted, ennobled and revered by the film and theater world, he
was Lord Olivier when he died, one of the very few Britons to be
given a seat in the House of Lords for his acting prowess.
   His Hamlet, Henry V, Othello and Richard III were widely
acclaimed, as well as, at age 76, his performance for television of
King Lear. He was a tragic film hero in ``Wuthering Heights'' and
portrayed the painful experience of aging in ``The Entertainer'' on
stage and ``A Voyage Round My Father'' and ``Brideshead Revisited''
on television.
   At the same time, with ferocious will, he fought cancer, pleurisy
and a muscle disease that made even handshakes agony. He endured two
miserable marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright,
contemplated murder and suicide and battled his own rages, guilts
and drinking.
   On his 80th birthday, tributes flowed during a ceremony at the
National Theater, which he founded in 1963.
   ``Awe and wonder, you gave us awe and wonder,'' actress Dame
Peggy Ashcroft told him at the time. Director Peter Hall called him
``the genius performer.''
   For Olivier, life and acting were inseparable. ``I have to act to
breathe,'' he said.
   By turns, he loved and hated his craft _ but never would
contemplate retiring from it. Acting simply consumed him.
   He was forever searching for new ways to broaden his range and
reach the hearts of his audience. For instance, seeking to conjure
up as abject a cry of despair as has ever been heard on stage, he
would imagine the cry of the arctic seal when it licks the salt laid
down by its hunters and its tongue sticks to the ice.
   Whatever sex drive he had, Olivier wrote in his 1982
autobiography ``Confessions of an Actor,'' went into his acting.
``You can't be more than one kind of athlete at a time. A sexual
athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of another
athletic kind.''
   Born May 22, 1907, in the town of Dorking southwest of London,
Laurence Kerr Olivier was the third child of an Anglican clergyman
who encouraged him to try acting.
   His first stage was at home, with footlights made of cocoa cans.
At 10, he was Brutus in a school performance. At 15, he donned
women's clothes to play Katherine in a Stratford Festival boys'
production of ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
   After studying acting in Birmingham, his first professional role
was in 1922 in a sketch in a small touring company. In his first
London role, in Alice Law's 1924 ``Byron,'' he tripped over a
doorsill and fell on his face.
   His first marriage, to actress Jill Esmond in 1930, produced a
son but ended in divorce. Meanwhile, his career was soaring through
Noel Coward's ``Private Lives'' in London and New York, and
Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' in which he and John Gielgud
alternated playing Romeo and Mercutio.
   With Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, fellow knights-to-be, he
formed a partnership that re-made English theater.
   Olivier played a dazzling succession of Shakespearean triumphs _
Hamlet, Henry V, Macbeth. Movie stardom came in 1939 when he moved
to Hollywood and made ``Wuthering Heights.''
   In that same year, Olivier appeared with Vivien Leigh in a New
York production of ``Romeo and Juliet.'' After nearly two years of
clandestine love, he obtained a divorce and the two were wed.
   That marriage, glamorous in public, was another debacle. Leigh
soon fell out of love, had a series of affairs and descended into
manic depression that tormented Olivier. He had crippling bouts of
stage fright and contemplated suicide.
   They finally were divorced in 1961, and Olivier wed actress Joan
Plowright, with whom he finally found happiness. They had a son,
Richard, and two daughters, Tamsin and Julie-Kate. All three are
either studying, or working in, the theater.
   During World War II, he made the three films that sealed his
reputation as the finest Shakespearean actor in film: ``Henry V,''
``Hamlet,'' for which he won a best-actor Oscar in 1949, and
``Richard III.'' In 1979, he received a special Academy Award for
his film work.
   In the 1960s and 1970s he had scores of memorable roles, from the
fading comic Archie Rice in John Osborne's ``The Entertainer'' to
Astrov in Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' to the Nazi who tortures Dustin
Hoffman in the film ``Marathon Man.''
   Olivier was proudest of his founding of Britain's National
Theater. ``Only a man of his titanic standing and relentless energy
could have brought the project to fruition,'' wrote Alan Hamilton in
The Times.
   He was among a group of actors knighted for their work, but in
1971 was elevated to a peerage as Baron Olivier of Brighton. The
only other theatrical peer is actor and theater founder Bernard
Miles.
   Other actors knighted included Gielgud, Richardson, Ms. Ashcroft,
Judi Dench, Alec Guinness and Michael Redgrave.
   His last public performance was a tape-recorded speech with
extracts from Henry V, his contribution to a campaign to prevent
developers covering up the ruins of the Rose Theater in London,
where Shakespeare is thought to have acted.

   Thunderstorms unleashed rare tornadoes that smashed through the
Northeast, hurling a trailer through the air, flinging a small plane
off a runway and ripping roofs off dozens of homes. At least two
people were killed, dozens injured and hundreds left homeless.
   National Guardsmen and police dogs searched through tangles of
flattened homes and toppled trees today for victims in Connecticut,
although there were no residents reported missing.
   A heat wave, meanwhile, scorched the Midwest and at least three
cities opened ``cooling centers'' to give residents an escape from
temperatures that hovered around 100 degrees Monday. No relief was
in sight, and officials in Illinois worried about drought. Heat was
a factor in one death in St. Louis.
   In the Northeast, tornadoes struck from northern New Jersey to
central Massachusetts. Hardest hit were coastal Connecticut and two
southeastern New York towns and a Long Island village. Thousands
were left without electricity.
   Scattered thunderstorms boomed over southeastern New York,
southern Connecticut and northern New Jersey. In a half-hour, 4.4
inches of rain poured in Oxford, Conn. Golfball-sized hail was
reported in several spots.
   ``This is the worst storm I've seen in 20 years of forecasting,''
said Mel Goldstein, director of the Weather Center at Western
Connecticut State University in Danbury. ``It's a major disaster for
that region.''
   As a precautionary measure, state police with trained dogs
searched for people who might have been trapped in the rubble.
Utility workers raced to cut off live wires and gas leaks while
scores of state police tried to seal off dangerous areas.
   Twelve-year-old Jennifer Bike was killed when a tree fell on her
tent at Black Rock State Park in Watertown Monday night and three
other girls inside were injured, police said. Two of the girls
remained in Waterbury Hospital early today in stable condition.
   A man died in New York City when he stepped into a puddle that
was electrified by exposed wires at an excavation site.
   Elizabeth Ferri, 40, of New Fairfield, Conn., was struck in the
head by lightning while walking her dog in the front yard. She was
knocked unconscious, but was was sent home from the hospital after
treatment.
   Hospitals in Waterbury and New Haven alone treated about 75
people, most of them for cuts and bruises. A 4-year-old New Haven
boy who fell from a second-floor window was in critical condition
with head injuries.
   In Waterbury, Conn., the storm tore off roofs, uprooted trees on
the city green, and bent the tip of a flagpole. Streets were
littered with glass.
   Mayor Joseph Santopietro imposed a 10 p.m. curfew.
   John Calamo, deputy director of civil preparedness in Hamden,
said 40 to 60 homes suffered heavy damage but no major injuries were
reported. The storm also did major damage to an industrial park, a
16-unit townhouse condominium and an auto body shop and the 25 cars
inside.
   ``There's probably three-quarters of a square mile of
devastation,'' he said.
   Brian Johnson, a tenant at the condominium, said the tornado
demolished his kitchen and sent kitchen knives flying into his
living room. ``My neighbor found her refrigerator in her living
room,'' he said.
   More than 112,000 people in northwestern and southern Connecticut
were without power, said spokesmen for Northeast Utilities and
United Illuminating.
   Fifty miles north of New York City, a tornado overturned cars and
damaged homes in Carmel and Southeast township. Officials declared a
state of emergency for all of Putnam County.
   At a condominium complex in Carmel, 70 units were damaged, half
of them severely, said the county's public information officer, Ken
Lott. Dozens were left homeless.
   ``You're looking at these condos and the front walls are just
gone,'' said Eric Gross of Carmel, a radio station reporter for WVIP
in Mount Kisco. ``You can look in and see their furniture on the
second floor.'' No serious injuries were reported.
   On Long Island, a tornado roared through Spadaro Airport in East
Moriches, hurling a trailer into the air and dropping it in pieces
across the airfield, witnesses said.
   A man inside the trailer, which served as a skydiving school, was
blown out and treated for cuts at a hospital.
   The wind picked a small plane off the runway and dumped it upside
down away into woods 100 feet away. Several other planes also were
damaged.
   In Suffolk and Nassau counties, the tornado and a second storm
knocked out power to 57,000 Long Island Lighting Co., but the lights
were back on in all but 5,000 homes by 5 a.m., said utility
spokeswoman Sue Roschak.
   In Massachusetts, a series of ``mini-tornadoes'' _ small twisters
50 to 100 feet in length _ knocked out power and telephones, felled
trees and damaged homes in the Princeton, Steling and West Boylston
areas.
   Most of the damage was in woods, said the National Weather
Service.
   In New Jersey, twisters left behind downed electrical wires and
fallen trees, but no injuries were reported. One tornado was spotted
near the George Washington Bridge over the Hudson River.
   The Midwest's heat spurred officials to open cooling centers, or
large air-conditioned rooms, in Chicago, St. Louis and Cincinnati.
   High temperatures Monday included 101 degrees in Chicago; 100 in
Moline and Rockford, Ill.; 98 degrees in St. Louis; and 97 degrees
in Peoria, Ill.
   Weather officials at the Quad City Airport in Moline said Monday
was the 28th consecutive day without measurable rain _ tying a
record for rainless stretches during a growing season that was set
in July and August of 1947.
   Lake Michigan was popular: more than 240,000 people sought relief
at Chicago beaches Monday.

<HEAD>Christian Air Force Jet Flys Low over West Beirut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Christian warplane flew over
Syrian-policed west Beirut today, a day after aides said Christian
army commander Gen. Michel Aoun would use air strikes against Syrian
gunboats blockading Christian ports.
   Police said the aging Hawker Hunter flew at a very low altitude
over west Beirut's waterfront, where the Syrians maintain howitzer
batteries that have been shelling the Christian coastline for more
than four months.
   ``It came very low over the sea from the north, flew low over the
boulevard and then turned west and north again,'' said an
eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
rules, said Syrian gunners manning dozens of multi-barreled
anti-aircraft guns in west Beirut did not open up on the jet fighter.
   ``It seems their radars did not detect the Hawker Hunter because
it flew very low,'' the spokesman said.
   A source at Aoun's air force, speaking on condition of anonymity,
described the midday overflight as a drill. He would not say more.
   The flight was the first by one of Aoun's three operational
Hawker Hunters since the outbreak of the confrontation with the
Syrians and allied forces in March.
   Aides to Aoun said Monday the 54-year-old Maronite general was
planning air strikes against Syrian gunboats blockading the
coastline of the 310-square-mile Christian region north of Beirut to
block Iraqi-supplied war materiel.
   In addition to the British-made Hawker Hunters, Aoun has eight
French-designed Gazelle helicopter gunships.
   Aoun's aides say the Syrians have six gunboats patrolling the
Christian-controlled 28-mile stretch of Lebanon's 130-mile
Mediterranean coast.
   On Monday, Syrian shelling sank a Greek-owned oil tanker that
unloaded its cargo at a Christian port. Syrian gunboats this week
intercepted at least three cargo ships carrying food supplies and a
fuel tanker headed for the Christian enclave.
   The independent daily paper An-Nahar said international
reinsurance companies have doubled the premium for ships sailing to
Lebanon because of the new risks involved.
   Arab League efforts to halt the 17-week confrontation appear to
be making little headway. By police count, the latest round of
violence has killed 405 people and wounded 1,581 people.
   Aoun, addressing a news conference Monday, said he rejected a
Syrian demand that ships heading for the Christian enclave be
searched by Arab observers for weapons.
   Asked whether his forces did receive Soviet-designed Frog-7
missiles from Iraq, Aoun said: ``I'm not going to say yes or no. Let
the Syrians find out the hard way.''
   The Syrians, who have an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon under
a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, tightened their blockade
after demanding removal of the missiles, which are capable of
striking Damascus.
   The Beirut daily paper Ash-Sharq, which is close to Syria, quoted
unidentified ``foreign intelligence officials'' as saying Iran
pledged to provide Lebanese Moslem and leftist factions with
missiles to match Aoun's Frog-7s.
   The latest round of violence broke out March 8 after Aoun imposed
a blockade on Moslem-run ports that he said were depriving his
government of $100 million a year in tax revenue.
   The Syrians, who back a rival Moslem government, retaliated by
besieging the Christian enclave, and Aoun pledged to drive the
Syrians out of the country.

   Mel Blanc, ``The Man of A Thousand Voices,''
including the legions of Looney Tune stars such as Porky Pig, Daffy
Duck, Tweety Pie and that mischievously silly wabbit Bugs Bunny, has
died. He was 81.
   The originator of such lines as Bugs' ``Eh, what's up, Doc?,''
Sylvester the Cat's ``Thufferin' thuccotash!,'' and Porky's
``Th-th-th-that's all, folks'' died Monday from complications from
heart disease and other ailments.
   By his own count, Blanc estimated he had mastered at least 900
different accents and dialects during a career spanning more than 50
years.
   Working in an age without high-tech sound effects, Blanc was a
human synthesizer, a verbal computer. It has been estimated that
more than 20 million people hear his voices daily.
   He invented the voices of such characters as Woody Woodpecker,
Speedy Gonzalez, Pepe Le Pew, Tasmanian Devil, Road Runner, Foghorn
Leghorn, Heathcliffe the cat, Speed Buggy, Yosemite Sam and that
Oscar-winning rabbit Bugs Bunny.
   He also did voices for the Roadrunner and numerous other
characters on 850 cartoons for Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes and Merrie
Melodies.
   He was the babbling Barney Rubble and the hyperactive, yammering
Dino, Fred Flintstone's pet dinosaur on the popular Hanna-Barbera
series; Mr. Spacely on ``The Jetsons'' and the Frito Bandito.
   ``Those voices were part of him, and he loved every moment of
it,'' said Blanc's son, Noel. ``When the kids would come to the door
or in the studio, he became those characters.''
   His final cartoon contribution came with 1988's popular
animation-live action film, ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit,'' in which he
did the voices of Daffy, Tweety, Bugs and Sylvester.
   The film's director, Robert Zemeckis, called Blanc a man ``whose
talent transcended all ages and broke through to the child in all of
us.''
   Longtime friend Mickey Rooney said: ``The reservoir of Hollywood
legends is extremely low, and Mel Blanc's passing is a deep personal
loss.''
   Born in San Francisco on May 30, 1908, and raised in Portland,
Ore., Blanc discovered his vocal skills while in grammar school.
   He started his career in 1927 as a musician and radio perfomer.
   In 1928, Blanc _ who played the bass, violin and sousaphone _ was
hired by the NBC Radio Orchestra in San Francisco.
   In 1937, he joined Warner Bros.' cartoon studio, which produced
one short feature subject each week.
   His first Warner character was a drunken bull in the Looney Tunes
short ``Picador Porky.'' As legend has it, the actor playing Porky
in that short did stutter. A few months later, Blanc took over in
``Porky's Duck Hunt,'' stuttering intact, and created Daffy Duck.
   Blanc introduced Bugs in the 1940 short ``A Wild Hare,'' giving
the character a combination Bronx and Brooklyn accent. Bugs won an
Oscar in 1958 for ``Nighty Night Bugs.''
   Elmer Fudd, the frustrated hunter who could neither catch Bugs
Bunny nor pronounce his ``R's'', was one of the few Warner Bros.
cartoon voices that wasn't created by Blanc. It was first done by
Arthur O. Bryan, but Blanc took over the voice in 1959 when Bryan
died.
   Blanc eventually became known as ``The Man of a Thousand
Voices.'' But the most Warner ever paid him was $20,000, and the
studio retained rights to the phrases Blanc invented.
   In addition to working in animation, he was a regular on radio's
``The Jack Benny Show,'' playing Professor LeBlanc, Benny's violin
teacher, and the train dispatcher who announced the stops of
``Ana-heim, A-zusa and KOOK-amunga!''
   Blanc also made the wheezing sounds of the timeworn 1924 Maxwell
automobile owned by Benny's skinflint comedy character.
   He reprised many of the roles when Benny moved to television.
   While recuperating in 1961 from a near-fatal car accident, Blanc
once recalled, he tried to count all his cartoon voices. He said he
fell asleep shortly after 400.
   He said when he came to, his first words to a physician were
``What's up, Doc?''
   In an interview last year, Blanc said Bugs _ originally called
Happy Rabbit _ was his favorite. ``Everybody knows who I am, Doc,''
he said in the character's voice. ``I don't cayuh where dey are or
who dey are. Even in Mars dey know about me.''
   Blanc made his last recording, a car commercial on May 19, the
day he entered Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   ``The only thing he said _ was `That's all folks,' and that's the
last thing that was recorded on tape,'' said Blanc's son, who
according to the elder Blanc is the only person who can imitate his
myriad voices.
   But Mel Blanc always will be remembered.
   ``As long as these cartoons are seen and enjoyed, Mel Blanc's
genius will be there for everyone,'' said Robert A. Daly, Warner
Bros.' chairman and chief executive officer.
   In addition to Blanc's son, survivors include his wife, the
former Estelle Rosenbaum. Funeral services were pending.

   Sen. Bob Graham said today former colleague
Chic Hecht does not deserve to be U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas
because he lacks the qualities needed to work with the island nation
to combat drug trafficking.
   But other senators said Hecht's record has been distorted and
that he is fully qualified by his Senate service and a banking and
retail career to serve as a U.S. ambassador.
   ``It is difficult to speak in opposition to the confirmation of a
former colleague,'' Graham, D-Fla., said at the outset of debate on
confirmation of the former Nevada senator to the ambassadorial post.
   But Graham said members of the Senate ``stand in a unique
position to evaluate whether he has the requisite qualities'' for
the ambassadorship, which involves coordinating the U.S. anti-drug
effort with Bahamian leaders.
   ``I regretfully come to the conclusion that this individual does
not meet the standards that I believe our nation should set, that he
does not send to the world the statement of our commitment to
victory in the war on drugs,'' Graham said. ``...He does not
deserve, nor does our nation deserve to be represented by him, in
the Bahamas.''
   Disagreeing, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., said his former homestate
colleague was jesting when he said he looked forward to service in
the Bahamas because of the pleasant lifestyle, golf, gambling and
fishing.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said Hecht had merely been attempting
to say that both the Bahamas and Las Vegas, Nev., have
multi-million-dollar tourist industries of great importance to their
economies.
   ``It is not something to be twisted and misrepresented and
hee-hawed by journalistic pygmies in the news media,'' Helms said,
declaring that Hecht has been attacked only because of his record as
a conservative.
   ``Chic is a remarkable man,'' Helms said. ``He is probably the
brightest man to serve in the Senate.''
   Reid, Helms and Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, all said that Hecht's
experience as the owner of a Nevada bank will serve him well in
dealing with a situation in the Bahamas in which drug traffickers
are said to use local banks to launder their illicit profits.
   Graham is leading the fight against confirmation of Hecht, known
for his malapropisms while serving in Congress. Hecht is opposed by
some former colleagues who say they are worried that he would be
more interested in golf than in waging war on drugs.
   Opponents are defying a tradition that the Senate almost never
turns on a former colleague named to a post requiring confirmation.
That tradition was severely dented earlier this year when the Senate
rejected the nomination of former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, to be
secretary of defense.
   But even the semblance of opposition is unusual. Graham contended
in advance of today's debate that Hecht _ whom he called a ``barrel
of gaffes'' _ deserved opposition because he is known more for
misstatements than diplomatic and law enforcement expertise.
   Graham has said that the next U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas must
play a ``vital, operational role'' in ending the island nation's
role as a transit point for narcotics destined for American streets.
   In his floor speech today, Graham said the American ambassador to
the Bahamas must spend considerable time in coordinating drug
enforcement activities.
   ``We need to have in that critical position ... not only someone
who has the requisite background in diplomatic and foreign policy,
but we also need someone who can give to the citizens of the Bahamas
... confidence in his or her ability to lead an effective effort in
the war against drugs,'' he said.
   At confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee earlier this year, Hecht drew criticism for his
lighthearted approach to his appointment.
   ``I am sure I will feel at home in the Bahamas,'' Hecht said.
``I've been involved in gambling in Nevada, and I've been involved
in banking for 25 years ...
   ``Also, I understand it is a nice lifestyle,'' he said. ``I love
golf and they have a lot of nice golf courses and good fishing.''
   Hecht, 60, who spent most of his working life in the women's
apparel industry, was defeated last year in his bid for a second
six-year Senate term.
   During the campaign he was quoted as saying he would oppose any

   The District of Columbia Council today dropped
plans to vote on a bill that would make gun manufacturers
financially liable for injuries and deaths caused in shootings, amid
concern that the legislation might interfere with existing laws.
   Wilhelmina Rolark, chairwoman of the council's judiciary
committee, withdrew the bill to allow for further study of any
potential conflict. Today's session was the last before the council
goes into summer recess, which means the matter cannot be
reconsidered until September.
   ``The intention of this legislation is to complement and not to
interfere with efforts in judicial forums,'' Mrs. Rolark said. ``In
order that the council staff can do some further work on existing
strict liability and tort laws, I am withdrawing the bill.''
   The bill, the first of its kind in the nation, faced an uncertain
reception in Congress, which reviews all laws passed by the council.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a frequent critic of the district
government, has likened the bill to an attempt ``to hold Black and
Decker responsible for `The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'''
   Walter Fauntroy, the district's non-voting delegate to Congress,
warned the council in a letter Monday that the bill would stir up
too much trouble in Congress.
   The council gave the measure preliminary approval by an 8-4 vote
two weeks ago. The measure was created in an attempt to slow the
city's drug-driven record murder rate.
   Richard Gardner, state and local affairs director of the National
Rifle Association, said, ``The bill is unconstitutional because it
places an extreme limitation on interstate commerce, and the federal
government is the only body that can regulate interstate commerce.''
   City Corporation Counsel Frederick D. Cooke also raised concerns
about the interstate commerce restrictions during city council
hearings last month on the measure.
   Council Chairman David A. Clarke, one of the bill's sponsors,
said the district's handgun liability bill resembles restrictions on
other products in other states.
   ``Historically, other states have regulated things like alcohol,
and the closest thing is that some have restricted dynamite,''
Clarke said. ``The only thing different about this bill is that it
is handguns.''
   The liability bill is just one of several proposals made as
drug-related crime has increased in the nation's capital.
   City officials hope to hire 1,200 new police officers by 1991,
more than half of them funded by the federal government.
   Through Monday, 228 persons had been killed in Washington in
1989, compared with 159 by the same time last year. In 1988, a
record 372 persons were killed.
   Police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Admonishes Two Cabinet Ministers for Remarks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KOZO MIZOGUCHI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Sousuke Uno today scolded two Cabinet
ministers for harming public trust in politics after one called
women ``useless'' in politics, and the other kindled fears of higher
taxes, officials said.
   Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa told reporters that Uno
admonished Hisao Horinouchi, minister of agriculture, forestry and
fisheries, and Shigenobu Sakano, the home affairs minister.
   Shiokawa told the 21-member Cabinet at a meeting today: ``Some
Cabinet members lacked discretion in remarks they made recently that
were contrary to Cabinet policy. Any remark that may be taken to
impair trust in national politics should be strictly avoided.''
   Uno asked each Cabinet member to behave ``always with a sense of
caution,'' Defense Agency chief Taku Yamasaki told reporters at a
briefing after the meeting.
   In a campaign speech on Friday for fellow Liberal Democratic
Party members running in upper house elections July 23, Horinouchi
said women are ``useless in the world of politics.''
   Horinouchi retracted the remark and apologized in a nationally
televised news conference the next day, but on Monday the Communist
Party demanded his dismissal and six women from the main opposition
Socialist Party called the prime minister's office to lodge their
protest.
   Sakano was quoted in news reports as saying Sunday that the new 3
percent sales tax, which took effect April 1, required handling a
lot of small change, and ``there will be fewer coins if the
percentage is an even number of 4.''
   But the reports said he added later he was not advocating an
increase in the unpopular tax. He apologized for causing
misunderstanding.
   Kyodo News Service said both Horinouchi and Sakano offered to
resign but Shiokawa persuaded them to stay. Uno and his Cabinet have
been in office only a month, following the resignation of former
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita to take responsibility for a
widespread influence-peddling scandal.
   The admonitions came as the governing Liberal Democratic Party
was trying to woo voters in the face of predictions that it will
lose its majority in the upper house in the July 23 elections.
   It suffered losses in the July 2 Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly
elections that political analysts attributed to the sales tax, the
influence-peddling scandal and allegations that Uno had kept paid
mistresses.
   Under fire from women's groups, Uno denied doing anything
immoral. But Horinouchi's remark brought even more denunciations
from women's organizations.
   The Liberal Democrats now have 139 seats in the 252-seat upper
house. Half of the upper house seats are at stake in the upcoming
election and analysts are predicting the governing party's holdings
will be reduced to fewer than 126.

   Nurses went on strike today against
California's largest pediatrics hospital and ambulances lined up to
take dozens of critically ill children to other hospitals.
   Officials of Children's Hospital were forced to search as far
away as Los Angeles for beds for children with special medical needs
after the strike vote Monday night. The transfer of patients was
expected to continue until tonight.
   ``Nurses haven't been getting anything in the way of raises over
the last couple of years,'' said Mary Lesander, 21, who arrived to
pick up her nurse mother and stayed to walk the line. ``My mom's got
to support a family. She can't work for next to nothing.''
   ``We're in the third year of an escalating nursing shortage
that's preventing us from giving good care,'' said Karen Cooper, a
pediatrics nurse in the intensive care unit and a union spokeswoman.
``We're taking a painful step today to avert an even worse crisis in
the 1990s.''
   More than 80 percent of the 700 Childrens Hospital nurses
belonging to the California Nurses Association turned out for the
vote, Cooper said.
   Although the exact tally hadn't been completed, Cooper said a
``large majority'' voted to reject an 18 percent pay raise over two
years offered by the hospital.
   The nurses, who earn from $32,000 to $39,000 per year, are
seeking a 26 percent increase over two years.
   Hospital officials planned to transfer about half of the 139
patients in the 194-bed facility to other hospitals, hospital
spokesman Steve Tiger said.
   ``We're sad that it's come to this, and we feel that the wage
demands of the nursing union are unrealistic,'' Tiger said. ``There
aren't any real staffing shortages at this hospital.''
   At 6 percent, Childrens has the lowest vacancy rate among nurses
in California, Tiger said.
   Many of the striking nurses planned to sign up with nursing
registries in the area, hoping to get placed temporarily at the
hospitals where their patients are transferred, Cooper said.
   ``We are worried about our patients, especially since the
hospital has been so irresponsible,'' Cooper said. ``But we're more
worried about what will happen to the patients in a couple of years
if we don't reverse the nursing shortage.''
   Children's closed its pediatrics trauma center at midnight, Tiger
said.
   ``By transferring these kids there's going to be a ripple effect
because we've just about filled up all the pediatric beds in the Bay
area,'' he said. ``We normally have 30 to 40 admissions a day. It's
anybody's guess where any of those kids will go.''
   The hospital also began postponing elective surgery and planned
to stop admitting patients from the emergency room. Walk-in
emergency care would still be offered, and general admissions would
be done on a case-by-case basis, Tiger said.
   The hospital plans to continue running its pediatric intensive
care unit despite the strike and will keep as many patients as it
can handle with non-staff registry nurses and nurses who cross
picket lines.

   The Solidarity movement welcomed George
Bush to its birthplace today as the president acknowledged the
decades of workers' courage and bloodshed that helped bring about
Poland's dramatic move toward democracy.
   ``Solidarity greets the President of the U.S.A.,'' read a huge
red-and-white banner hung near Solidarity Square outside the Lenin
shipyard where the Soviet bloc's first independent trade union was
founded in 1980.
   Twenty-five thousand Poles, including Solidarity members from
chapters across the country, gathered at the towering workers'
monument at the yards' gate to hear Bush speak.
   They chanted ``Long Live Bush,'' and when the president suggested
young Poles stay in their homeland instead of emigrating, they
chorused ``Stay with us!''
   ``If only Poland could have such a president,'' said Jan Panchek,
91, a retired farmer who arrived hours early to glimpse Bush.
   Now bankrupt and awaiting a possible bailout by Polish-American
businesswoman Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the shipyard is the spirtual
home of Solidarity. As recently as last August it was the scene of
strikes that galvanized the nation.
   By visiting the yard, and lunching at the home of Solidarity
chief Lech Walesa, Bush planned a symbolic gesture to the workers
whose battles with communist authorities in 1970, 1980 and 1988 kept
alive the nation's aspirations for greater freedom and a better life.
   The shipyard, dating to the 19th century, was rebuilt after World
War II as an industrial showcase of the newly created Polish
People's state. It turned out dozens of ships a year, mainly for the
Soviet Union.
   Workers from around the country, usually from peasant
backgrounds, were attracted by its relatively high wages and promise
of technical training. One such worker in the late 1960s was a young
man from the village of Popowo, Lech Walesa.
   Dingy, cramped housing and hazardous working conditions soon
created tensions among this new elite and a round of sharp price
increases just before Christmas 1970 set off strikes all along the
Baltic coast.
   Outside the gates of the yard, security forces opened fire on
marching workers, killing several. Hundreds are believed to have
died in the strikes, an event that remains etched on the national
consciousness. The official death count was 45.
   When Solidarity arose in 1980, one of its first demands was to
erect a monument to the victims of 1970. The 42-meter sculpture of
three crosses and anchors was designed and built by the shipyard
workers themselves.
   It remained an embarrassing reminder to the government during the
years after the December 1981 martial-law crackdown, when Solidarity
was banned but struggled on as an illegal organization.
   Authorities claimed Solidarity was dead except for a few thousand
diehards, but the union kept up a vibrant underground structure.
   Waves of strikes in May and August 1988 demonstrated Solidarity
was still very much alive. In exchange for ending the August unrest,
authorities resumed negotiations with Walesa.
   That led to the legalization of Solidarity and to last month's
elections in which union-backed candidates won all but one of the
261 seats they were allowed to contest.
   Union organizing took second place to the election campaign and
leaders concede they have signed up only a fraction of their former
strength of 10 million _ between 1 million and 2 million members.
   Solidarity now must contend with a number of painful new
challenges.
   Poland's need to reform the crisis-ridden economy into a
competitive, market-oriented structure could require closing
outmoded and inefficient factories where Solidarity members work.
   And eliminating state subsidies for meat, milk and other staples
will bring steep price increases.

   Two bombs exploded in Mecca as thousands
of people took part in the annual pilgrimage to Islam's most sacred
city, killing one person and injuring 16, the official Saudi press
said today.
   Two of the injured are in critical condition, the Saudi news
agency said, quoting an unnamed Saudi Interior Ministry security
official.
   No one claimed responsibility for the blasts, which occurred at
10 p.m. Monday while hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were praying
and walking around the Kaaba, Islam's holiest shrine, inside the
Grand Mosque.
   Iran, which has boycotted the pilgrimage this year in a feud with
Saudi Arabia, accused the Saudis of planting the bombs to discredit
Tehran.
   Iran's prime minister, Hussein Musavi, said the two bomb blasts
late Monday were an effort ``by the Saudi regime to create a climate
of suppression and repression,'' the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported Tuesday.
   A Iranian Foreign Ministry statement urged pilgrims in Mecca to
protest the bombings, which it said were carried out by ``the United
States and its agents in the region,'' a reference to pro-Western
Saudi Arabia.
   Security sources in Riyadh said a number of suspects have been
arrested and are being interrogated.
   They said the injured include Pakistanis, Indians, Egyptians and
two Saudis. The identity of the dead person has not been released.
   The explosions occurred on the main road leading to the Grand
Mosque and a nearby overpass.
   One of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
explosives were bombs of ``the type that makes a loud bang, has
quick impact, but causes little damage.''
   Diplomatic sources said investigators believe they were crude,
timed devices, or they would have injured more people.
   An estimated 1.8 million Moslems from more than 80 countries are
in Mecca on the annual pilgrimage to the city, birthplace of the
prophet Mohammed. During the pilgrimage, known as hajj, Moslems also
travel to Medina to visit the tomb of the 7th century founder of
Islam.
   A pilgrimage is one of the five basic duties of all Moslems.
   Iran is boycotting the hajj because of limits on the number of
pilgrims who can take part and has called on Moslems to disrupt the
ceremonies. Last year, Saudi Arabia began limiting the number of
pilgrims to Mecca and Medina based on a country's population.
   Security sources refused to link Monday's explosions to the
Iranians, saying the investigations were incomplete.
   ``Only a small number of Iranians came on their own and these
were mainly from Europe,'' said one security source.
   The pilgrimage season has been marred by disturbances since
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. In that year, religious
extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca and held it for two
weeks before Saudi forces stormed it.
   More than 250 people were killed. Saudi authorities later
beheaded 63 more.
   The Saudis arrested scores of Iranian Revolutionary guards posing
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and
explosives.
   The next year, 402 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were killed in
riots in Mecca that the Saudis say were instigated by
fundamentalists.
   Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran in April 1988. Tehran since has
campaigned to strip King Fahd of his title as ``custodian of the two
holy shrines'' and place Mecca and Medina under international
supervision.

   Women won equal rights in the restroom under
a law signed today by Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   The law, dubbed the ``Potty Parity'' proposal, requires new
buildings to have as many toilets for women as they do for men. The
measure _ subject of sometimes silly debate _ passed the Legislature
140-1 last month.
   The lone dissenter, Assemblyman Kemp Hannon, said women should
have more toilets than men because women take longer in the
bathroom. A Cornell University study called for women's rooms to
have six toilets for every four in men's rooms, including urinals,
Hannon said.
   The law applies to any new building designed for public assembly
and built after June 1, 1990. The number of toilets in a women's
room would have to equal the number of urinals and toilet stalls in
men's rooms.
   Two other states have similar laws, according to Assembly sponsor
Helen Marshall.

   A girl born with a bullet in her chest

surgery.
   ``What should I name her? Miracle Baby, or what? That's what I
was thinking about, because she is a miracle baby,'' said Evelyn
Page, 31, who gave birth Saturday, 8{ months into her pregnancy,
after being shot with a small-caliber firearm.
   Ms. Page, who also was in satisfactory condition, said she was
shot by a man who accosted her on the street and demanded that she
get into his car.
   ``I knew my baby had been shot, the way my baby started moving in
me,'' Ms. Page said. ``My baby started moving real fast. She kicked
the whole time.''
   The infant, delivered by Caesarean section, underwent surgery to
remove the bullet shortly after birth.
   The bullet broke a rib but did not damage internal organs, said
Dee Denton, a spokeswoman for Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center.
She said the youngster was taken to the intensive care ward of the
Regional Medical Center, where she was in satisfactory condition.

   A former Cabinet minister pleaded guilty
Tuesday to embezzling trade union funds and was given a six-month

   Einfrid Halvorsen resigned as minister of consumer affairs April
28 following published allegations that she stole about $21,500 from
a Skien union local in her 10-year term as treasurer until 1987.
   Mrs. Halvorsen, 51, repaid the entire amount, and said she had
taken union funds due to family problems, according to the NTB news

   The court said the embezzlement violated the trust placed in Mrs.
Halvorsen as public servant, union official and Cabinet minister,
the state NRK radio said.
   Mrs. Halvorsen had taken a leave of absence as mayor of this
eastern Norway city, 60 miles southwest of Oslo, to serve in Prime

   When driving in fog at night, should your car's
headlights be set on high beam or low beam?
   The answer is low beam, which will direct light onto the road
ahead, while light from high beams will hit the fog and be reflected.
   That question and answer were part of a practice test released
Tuesday to prepare motorists for the National Driving Test on Aug.
29 on CBS, just before the long Labor Day weekend.
   More people lose their lives in accidents during the Labor Day
holiday than any other holiday period.
   ``It's been a long time since most of us took a driving test,''
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said at a Capitol Hill news
conference. ``Fifty million Americans will be able to renew
themselves and examine themselves.''
   Skinner, several members of Congress, the National Safety Council
and other highway safety organizations cooperated with Valvoline Oil
Co. and CBS in preparing the show, the first National Driving Test
in about 20 years.
   The 25-question test will cover defensive driving techniqus,
rules of the road, basic mechanical know-how and how to deal with
unexpected events.
   Carl F. Frey, Valvoline senior vice president, declined to say
how much the Kentucky-based company is spending for the hour-long
show and distribution of the test preparation booklets through
retail outlets. The booklet also will be published in TV Guide and
USA Today, Frey said.
   More than 48,000 people are killed and 1.8 million injured in the
nearly 21 million accidents on the nation's highways each year.
   Actor Christopher Reeve will be the host of the program, which
will include appearances by actors Perry King, Lorenzo Lamas, Betty
White and Susan Sullivan, Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner and
country singer Randy Travis.

   Forest fires ravaged thousands of acres in Colorado canyons
today, destroying 65 homes and threatening 18 others, while
California authorities blamed a cigarette for a blaze that forced
hundreds of evacuations.
   Two firefighters have been killed, the first fatalities of this
summer's blazes in several Western states.
   A rapidly expanding brush fire in Utah has moved near two
transmission lines that relay power to much of the West, but
officials say no outages have occurred despite the temporary
shutdown Monday of one 345,000-volt line.
   The fire, which has scorched more than 1,000 acres in the Little
Sage Valley 15 miles southwest of Nephi, swept near the
Intermountain Power Plant's Intermountain-Mona transmission lines,
both major east to west carriers.
   In California, officials said today a smoldering cigarette may
have ignited a fire that has burned more than 4,000 acres on Mount
Laguna and forced the evacuation of hundreds of mountain residents
and visitors.
   ``A team of investigators were up there Monday, and they managed
to narrow it down to a cigarette butt as the most likely cause,''
said Dolores Fremter, a spokeswoman with the California Department
of Forestry.
   Firefighters battled a half-dozen blazes in the Colorado
mountains including a 2,200-acre fire that destroyed 65 homes and
threatens 18 others near Boulder and another burning near the
ancient Indian cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde National Park.
   ``It's like a war scene,'' said Jonathan Trent, whose mountain
cabin was destroyed by fire. ``It's like someone took a bomb and
dropped it on the cabin.''
   ``Today, they are going to be patrolling for spot fires on the
lines that have been built and stationed at threatened structures,''
said Mary Ann Chambers, a fire information officer with the U.S.
Forest Service at Boulder. Chambers confirmed that 65 homes had
burned.
   ``Low temperatures really helped Monday. In the afternoon it got
down into the 60s and there was a little moistures on the fire, but
after the rain came the winds and dried it out.''
   People are being allowed back into their homes, but they are not
allowed to stay there overnight, Chambers said.
   Sheriff Brad Leach said the fire was started Sunday by a resident.
   ``We know for sure where the fire started and that it was from
somebody's trailer,'' Leach said. ``We're questioning that
individual to try and determine whether he knew he did it or whether
it was an accident.''
   At Mesa Verde, site of the ancient Anasazi cliff dwellings,
archaeologists flagged ruins so work crews digging fire lines would
not damage them.
   ``We're not going to compromise the archaeology of the area to
put a bulldozer line in,'' said Paul Hefner, a firefighter from the
Bureau of Land Management. ``We've got to stop this fire, but not at
that cost.''
   The blaze, which had grown to 2,600 acres, was 50 percent
contained Monday.
   In California's scenic Big Sur wilderness, 120 miles south of San
Francisco, a falling tree killed a prison inmate Sunday night and
six members of his crew were injured, including two with broken
bones, said state forestry department spokeswoman Karen Terrill.
   Authorities decided after the death to stop night firefighting.
Fire lines were being staffed, but crews were not allowed to attack
the blaze, which is burning brush on slopes rising from the ocean.
   ``It's steep and rocky and slick,'' said forestry department
spokesman Bill Jones.
   The fire had blackened 2,655 acres and was 50 percent contained
Monday night, Jones said. No buildings were threatened.
   In Nebraska, firefighters used aerial attacks against fires that
burned dry pine trees and grassland over an area 22-by-8 miles in
the state's northwest corner.
   Up to six planes at a time each dumped 300 gallons of water on
the flames.

landed his crop-duster on a section of U.S. 20 that had been blocked
by state troopers to facilitate loading water from firetrucks.
   The blaze, which officials estimated had charred about 50,000
acres since Saturday, was partially contained and no longer
threatened historic Fort Robinson, built in 1874.
   ``We are cautiously optimistic that the worst part of the fire is
over,'' Gov. Kay Orr said at the Chadron Airport, about 22 miles
east of Crawford.
   ``It is better contained, but not fully contained,'' said Jerry
Larson, deputy state fire marshal.
   In Arizona, lightning struck and killed Ernie Cachini, a
firefighter from New Mexico who was battling a fire in the Tonto
National Forest.
   ``He was a member of the famous Zuni Firefighters team from Zuni
Pueblo,'' said forest spokeswoman Joyce Hassell. ``He was on the
steep slope ... when he was struck.''
   Two fires that consumed nearly 2,000 acres near Fremont National
Forest in south-central Oregon were largely controlled early today,
the U.S. Forest Service said.
   Dan Sholly, chief ranger at Yellowstone National Park, which last
year suffered its most destructive fire season on record, said the
park was drying out more each week.
   ``We can anticipate signficant fire activity in Yellowstone,''
Sholly said at a news conference he attended with James Ridenour,
new director the National Park Service.
   Crews were expected to pull out of the Bridger-Teton Forest fire
in Wyoming today, after containing the blaze that burned 3,447 acres
about 150 miles southeast of Yellowstone.
   Crews in Utah were close to containing a 15,500-acre fire in
rough, remote terrain about 20 miles west of the Colorado line.

   Moviegoers are too sloppy, so the
city will ban all eating and drinking in cinemas, the mayor said
Tuesday.
   Mayor Elyas Omar said the move was to ensure the cleanliness of
the theaters, which often are dirty because of empty food packets
and drink containers being left behind by patrons.
   ``The cinemas should be clean places that provide comfort to
patrons, not places for eating and drinking. If one wants to eat or
drink, the place to do it is a stall or a restaurant,'' Elyas said
at a meeting with three officials of Borneo Film Organization Ltd.
   He suggested the theaters have a stand outside to sell food and
drinks and for patrons to consume it there.
   Elyas did not say what would be done to those ignoring the
warning, but other officials said the law forbidding littering in
public places could be applied to the movie houses. Under this law,
people face fines of up to $185 even for flicking cigarette ashes.

<TEXT>
   Lawyers have selected a federal court jury of
eight people to hear a trial on behalf of 8,000 farmers in 10 states
who sued a company that allegedly oversold 1988 drought insurance
policies.
   The trial was scheduled to begin Wednesday before U.S. District
Judge Carl B. Rubin.
   U.S. Magistrate Robert Steinberg presided over Monday's jury
selection. Rubin was to decide later which of the eight jury members
will be alternates, since a civil jury usually has six members. The
trial could last two weeks, lawyers said.
   In the lawsuit, the farmers are asking for damages of at least
$20 million in addition to unspecified punitive damages against Good
Weather International Corp. of Syosset, N.Y., said Stanley M.
Chesley, a Cincinnati lawyer representing the farmers.
   His clients allege that Good Weather sold them drought insurance
policies backed by Chubb Corp. of Warren, N.J.
   Chubb later canceled the farmers' drought insurance coverage
after learning Good Weather had sold more than the available number
of such policies.
   Chubb has joined the farmers from Ohio, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky,
Indiana, Tennessee, Minnesota, Michigan, Missouri, and Wisconsin as
plaintiffs in the suit.
   Chesley said the farmers and Chubb have an agreement in which the
farmers would receive two-thirds of any winnings from the lawsuit
and Chubb would get one-third.
   Chubb and its insurance subsidiaries agreed last November to a
settlement in which they set aside a fund of $48.1 million to settle
the farmers' claims. Lawrence Kane Jr., a Cincinnati lawyer named by
Rubin to distribute the money to the farmers, began doing so in
March.
   Chubb said Good Weather violated its contract with the company by
selling too many crop insurance policies. Chubb said Good Weather
owes it at least $75 million because of the overselling, and also
wants Good Weather to pay the fees of lawyers Chubb hired.
   The farmers said they suffered emotional distress because they
were denied drought insurance, in addition to losses stemming from
interest payments they would have received had they been issued
policies.
   Good Weather denies all of the claims by the farmers and Chubb,
said its attorney, James Moore.

   President Bush's visit to Hungary is
providing an opportunity for several private enterprise ventures of
the kind Hungarian and U.S. officials are encouraging.
   Radio Bridge, a new, private, English-language radio station, on
Tuesday began a trial broadcast to coincide with the two-day visit,
the official MTI news agency said.
   The station, which will broadcast on a trial basis for the
duration of the Bush visit, until noon Thursday, plans to go on the
air regularly at the end of the year, MTI said.
   Radio Bridge, which will broadcast exclusively in English, is
aimed at foreign businessmen in Hungary with broadcasts of political
and economic news as well as cultural and tourist information.
   A Swedish-U.S.-Canadian partnership and Hungarian private
individuals have set up a limited company to finance the station,
MTI said.
   MTI said it was the first private radio station to broadcast in
Hungary. Commercial radio stations began broadcasting in Hungary in
1986 primarily as a service to tourists but also became popular with
Hungarians.
   During the Bush visit, Radio Bridge is broadcasting out of a
studio in the Hungarian Academy of Scieces using transmitting
equipment lent by the Hungarian post office, MTI said.
   Since it pioneered Soviet bloc economic reform in the late 1960s,
Hungary has allowed a fair degree of latitude to small-scale
economic entrepreneurs. Many have proved more than adept.
   Two young Hungarians took the opportunity of the presidential
visit to offer Hungarians a snapshot with Bush, using a Polaroid
camera and a lifesize, stand-up portrait of the smiling president.
   Laszlo Halnai and Peter Lakos on Tuesday offered Hungarians their
``snapshot with the president'' for 200 forints ($3.30) a shot.
   Sixty or 70 takers came forward in the first hour, said Laszlo
Halnai, who advertised the deal with large billboards slung over his
shoulders as he wandered near Budapest's main Vaci Utca shopping
mall area.
   Asked whether permission was required from city authorities to
embark on the project, Halnai grinned. ''Yes, but we didn't get
around to applying for it yet.'''

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev left Tuesday on a
troubleshooting mission to Leningrad, where the Communist Party
leadership failed to win parliamentary elections in March, Tass said.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov said problems have been accumulating
in Leningrad, according to the official news agency.
   Leningrad party officials, including the city's party boss, Yuri
F. Solovyev, failed to win a seat in the Congress of People's
Deputies in the March 26 elections.
   ``Gorbachev has gone there to help sort out a whole gamut of
problems on the spot,'' Ryzhkov said at a session of the Supreme
Soviet legislature.
   Tass said, ``The program for the Soviet leader's stay in
Leningrad includes meetings with Communists, public activists,
economic executives and managers of the city.''
   Gorbachev visited the Izohorsky power engineering site and was to
tour a Soviet-West German shoe-making enterprise, Tass said.
   The factories of Leningrad, with a population of 5 million,
account for more than 3 percent of the country's industrial output,
the news agency said.
   Tass did not say how long Gorbachev would remain in Leningrad,
the Soviet Union's second largest city. He returned from an official
visit to Bucharest, Romania, on Sunday.

   Hungary's leaders are hoping the first
visit by an American president will cast a favorable light on their
moves toward democracy and help attract more Western investment.
   Unlike their Polish counterparts, the Hungarians were not
expecting any direct aid from President Bush to alleviate their
stiff foreign debt.
   But like the Poles, the Hungarians have a heavy load to carry.
Hungary's nearly $18 billion foreign debt is the highest per capita
in Eastern Europe.
   Hungary has been at the forefront of economic reforms in the
communist bloc since the 1960s, encouraging private entrepreneurs
and even a small but energetic stock market.
   It is also the land where Soviet tanks and troops crushed a
revolt against communist rulers in 1956.
   Today, government officials and ordinary folk alike share the
hope that the Bush visit will help mend Hungary's economic woes and
further democratic reforms.
   It's ``a great honor for a small country such as ours for the No.
1 political leader of a huge country to visit it,'' Premier Miklos
Nemeth told the government daily Magyar Hirlap.
   ``The most important thing as far as I am concerned is to
eliminate the doubts which still exist in the United States, and in
other Western countries, about a roll-back in Hungary, and the
security of capital investments,'' Nemeth said.
   Ferenc Pityo, who sells flowers on Budapest's lively main
shopping mall, Vaci Utca, said the Bush visit ``might do some good
for the country as a whole.''
   ``But what would do me a lot of good is if they gave me a
permanent and not a temporary permit to sell my flowers,'' added the
woman, who said she has four children.
   Hungary's English-language daily and other state-run media ran
supplements to mark the historic visit.
   ``I'm happy that the relationship is unfolding the way it is,''
said Zoltan Benedikt, a university student. ``But I'm afraid that if
Bush is bringing any capital, it's going to be given to the company
managers who have already shown their incompetence in handling these
funds.''
   Any retreat from current efforts to build a market-oriented
economy and a multi-party democracy in Hungary would be ``a national
tragedy for our people,'' Nemeth said.
   The premier, 41, an economist who once spent a semester at
Harvard University, is one of four men currently running Hungary at
the head of its Communist Party until a party congress selects new
leaders this fall.
   The four-man leadership took control June 24 in what was widely
seen as a compromise between the strengthening reformist wing and
more orthodox communists who oppose what they regard as a return to
capitalism and the bourgeois democracy that ruled before the
communist takeover in 1948.
   Party general secretary Karoly Grosz, who previously headed the
party alone, was forced to share power with Nemeth, radical reformer
Imre Pozsgay and Rezso Nyers, who pioneered the economic reforms of
the 1960s. Nyers fell from grace in 1973 but now has been made party
chairman.
   Bush meets each of the four Wednesday. Later, he sees leaders of
emerging democratic opposition groups negotiating with the
communists on the framework and timetable for multi-party elections
next year.
   Nemeth stressed that political and economic reforms must move
together to avoid ``a political explosion'' that would wreck any
changes.
   Western assistance is needed to transform the largely state-run
economy, he said, providing new jobs for Hungarians, whose outmoded
factories are threatened with closure under government austerity
policies.
   U.S. and Hungarian officials will sign four agreements Wednesday.
   Senior Foreign Ministry official Jenoe Alfoeldi told The
Associated Press that one of them involves a trade and development
program for Bozsod county in Hungary's northeast, a heavily
industrialized area where large steel mills and other industries are
running at a heavy loss.
   The other agreements concern tourism, air traffic and
agriculture, Alfoeldi said.
   While Bush's visit signals Western recognition of Hungary's
reforms, officials emphasize Budapest is not pulling too far away
from Moscow or other communist allies.
   Withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact ``would be quite inappropriate
right now,'' Nemeth told Magyar Hirlap.
   ``It is very important for us to preserve and develop the
relationship with the Soviet Union,'' Foreign Minister Gyula Horn
told reporters Monday.

<TEXT>
   The half-century Hollywood career of Laurence
Olivier, generally acclaimed the greatest English-speaking actor,
ranged from abject failure to absolute triumph.
   ``He was an amazingly daring actor, the best of our time. ... As
an actor he dared to go where few others venture,'' his close friend
Charlton Heston said today after learning of Olivier's death in
London at age 82.
   From the 1931 ``Friends and Lovers'' to ``The Jazz Singer'' with
Neil Diamond in 1980, Olivier appeared in a wide variety of American
films. But his greatest triumph on screen came with his
self-directed ``Henry V'' and ``Hamlet,'' both made in England.
   The highest achievement of his Hollywood career came 50 years ago
with ``Wuthering Heights.'' It was a miserable period for the actor,
who was deeply in love with Vivian Leigh, though both were married
to others. He had wanted Miss Leigh to play Catherine instead of
Merle Oberon.
   ``I was blind with misery at being parted from Vivian, who would
have been the perfect Cathy,'' Olivier wrote in his memoirs, ``and I
was sure Merle was lacking in the essential passionate qualities.''
   Oberon and Olivier loathed each other while playing world-class
lovers. At first, Olivier's performance was so ``hammy'' that
producer Samuel Goldwyn threatened to shut down the picture _ ``Will
you look at that actor's ugly face? He's dirty. His performance is
rotten, it's stagey, it's just nothing.''
   Director William Wyler persuaded Olivier to act more subtly, and
Heathcliff and Catherine became classic lovers of the screen.
   Olivier won the first of his eight Academy Award nominations for
best actor in 1939, but he was overshadowed that year by the triumph
of his future wife, Miss Leigh, in ``Gone With the Wind.''
   In a 1959 interview when he arrived here for ``Spartacus,''
Olivier recalled his Hollywood beginnings: ``I first came here for a
contract at RKO in 1931 (with his then-wife Jill Esmond). The film
business was in terrible shape, and we had several changes in
management.
   ``Then David Selznick became head of the studio. He made some
fine pictures. He also made some fine pay cuts. I refused to take
one and was summarily dropped.''
   The actor returned to Hollywood in 1933 to star opposite Greta
Garbo in ``Queen Christina.'' He was abruptly replaced with John
Gilbert, reportedly because Garbo wanted a comeback for her old
flame Gilbert.
   ``The truth is she fired me,'' Olivier said. ``And I must say
that she was absolutely right. I was 23 or 24 (actually 26) at the
time and I simply wasn't up to it. I went back to England again.''
   Olivier returned over the years for such triumphs as ``Rebecca''
in 1940, ``Carrie'' in 1952 and ``Marathon Man'' in 1976. In his
later years, he was earning $1 million per picture and was less
selective, appearing in such films as ``Clash of the Titans,''
``Inchon'' and ``The Bounty.''
   The Hollywood film community remained in awe of the great Olivier
and in 1979 he was awarded an honorary Oscar. Said presenter Cary
Grant: ``He represents the ultimate in acting.''
   Olivier's acceptance speech sounded so eloquent in his well
modulated tones that Jon Voight was reduced to tears. Later, Olivier
admitted that he had forgotten his speech and adlibbed a series of
glowing phrases that read like gibberish.
   Only Laurence Olivier could have managed such a performance.

<TEXT>
   Laurence Olivier spoke of his life, his work and
his fellow actors in books and interviews throughout his career.
Some of his comments:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On the craft of acting in general:
   _ ``I think there is much that the public doesn't understand
about acting. I think they understand baseball, cricket, or football
a great deal better.''
   _ ``They say we are mere shadows. I like to think of the true
actor as a skeleton. Bone, just bone, on to which he places and
molds the flesh, rather like a sculptor; but he has an advantage
over the sculptor because his creation is animated.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On his own acting:
   _ ``I am a character actor, not the leading man who seeks
applause on his first entrance.''
   _ ``If the new generation were required to do what I do now, they
would have extreme difficulty, because it took a long time to arrive
at where I am. But I feel that if they were to teach me their job,
they would find that I could grasp it quite quickly, because I'm
well versed in my work.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On critics:
   _ ``I suppose critics are a grim necessity. There are good ones
and bad ones, and ones who simply masquerade as critics but are mere
purveyors of columns of gossip, tittle-tattle signifying nothing.
Poor creatures who are pushed by their pens and not their
intellects.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On Michael Caine (his co-star in the movie ``Sleuth''):
   _ ``He has the true personality of a star. ... He's restless to
widen his range. Mark my words. The mark of Caine on the cinema will
be deeper yet. ... An actor who's never out of sorts with the camera
or the world.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On Katharine Hepburn (his co-star in ``Love Among the Ruins''):
   _ ``With Hepburn _ as with all the great stars _ you have a deep
sense of her personality, of her strong and still center of gravity
which radiates her wit, her vulnerability, her courage, and her
outspokenness. ... I could never aspire to Hepburn's star quality.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On ``King Lear'':
   _ ``When you've the strength for it, you're too young; when
you've the age, you're too old. It's a bugger isn't it? ... Frankly,
Lear is an easy part, one of the easiest parts in Shakespeare apart
from Coriolanus. We can all play it. It is simply bang
straightforward.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On luck:
   _ ``I have often been fortunate to have been in the right place
at the right time. Blessed in that way. A sense of timing, almost an
instinct. But then timing is made by the man, I think, and therefore
man creates his own destiny. Take it or leave it, my timing was
right, and I accept that with gratitude, whether it was man-made or
God-made.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   On the theater:
   _ ``Whenever I walk into a theater I feel that I am at home. ...
I can no longer work in the theater, but the thrill will never leave
me.''

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, acknowledging he
has no ``quick fix'' for streamlining the Pentagon, today put
forward a complex plan to overhaul the military bureaucracy and
tighten controls over weapons purchases.
   He predicted that some $30 billion in total savings could be
achieved by the 1993 fiscal year if his ``simplified and more
efficient'' weapons acquisition system is put in place.
   Procurement accounts for more than $60 billion of this year's
$305 billion defense budget and involves more than a half-million
civilian and uniformed employees of the Defense Department.
   At a news conference, Cheney said the ever-tightening defense
budget, as well as the amount of distrust in Congress and among the
public about the way the Pentagon does business, requires that
something be done.
   ``There's no silver bullet here. ... We have a blueprint that we
plan to pursue ... to try to significantly improve the way we do
business,'' he said.
   But Cheney, a former member of the Republican leadership in the
House, acknowledged that he won't be able to achieve changes on his
own. ``If we're going to be successful, it will be because we got
Congress to cooperate,'' he said.
   President Bush requested the management report five months ago as
part of a major review spurred on by a series of weapons procurement
scandals. Defense industry employees and consultants and Pentagon
workers have been accused of improperly using confidential
information to funnel lucrative contracts to certain manufacturers.
   The elements of the package have been circulating in Washington
for some time. The report already has stirred some opposition on
Capitol Hill, where it has been snubbed as not going far enough to
outline details for revising the Pentagon's procurement practices.
   The report seeks some relief from congressional oversight
requests, complaining about the ``staggering'' number of reports
Congress requires from the Defense Department each day.
   Some sections of the plan require congressional approval. For
instance, the study asks that Congress implement fully a biennial,
rather than annual, defense budget and establish select committees
in both houses to review and rewrite ``the maze of federal
procurement laws.''
   Many of the ideas included in the reform package were first
proposed in the 1986 Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management,
also known as the Packard Commission.
   In a summary released with the report, Cheney said that because
of competing national priorities, ``the real resources available for
defense in the early 1990s are likely to decline.''
   ``If we are to protect our global interests, met our
responsibilities and minimize the risks to our security, we must
preserve essential military capabilities through ever more skillful
use of the resources at our disposal,'' he said.
   Cheney called for ``better teamwork'' to put his initiatives into
reality.
   ``None represents a quick fix. Only an unreserved and sustained
commitment on the part of the administration, Congress and industry
will bring about real change,'' he said.
   The secretary's goal is ``to make clear the lines of authority in
the (procurement) process, not only to make it more responsive, but
also more responsible,'' said one Pentagon official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The proposals include:
   _The establishment of an executive panel to make all the major
decisions at the Defense Department.
   The board would be composed of the secretary, the deputy
secretary, undersecretary, the deputies for procurement and
acquisitions, the heads of the various services and chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff. The panel would be smaller than the current
Defense Resources Board, which advises Cheney on major weapons and
budgetary decisions.
   _Allowing the deputy secretary of defense to oversee the
Pentagon's system for planning, programming and devising its budget.
   The deputy secretary would oversee the Defense Planning and
Resources Board, which also will be asked to come up with a coherent
national defense strategy, as well as a 20-year ``road map'' on the
long-term needs and investment plans for the department.
   _Enhancing the powers of the undersecretary of defense for
acquisition _ dubbed the ``acquisition czar.'' The undersecretary
would have ``full authority for major acquisition programs,'' which
would trim some of the services' powers.
   _Paring down and consolidate overlapping structures in the
acquisition system, the proposal under which Cheney predicts will
``eliminate layers and functions that have no value,'' and primarily
through payroll cuts achieve the $30 billion in savings over the
next four budget years.
   The report notes that some 580,000 civilian and military
personnel around the world are involved in the procurement process.
The report suggests trimming the organizations on a phased basis
``by at least 15 percent'' by 1993.
   _The establishment of a Defense Contract Managment Agency to
consolidate its contract administration activities and ride herd on
the contracts after they have been awarded.
   _Streamlining the Defense Acquisitions Board, which would study
the cost and performance of weapons programs at each stage of
development.
   _Establishing a ``dedicated corps'' of military procurement
specialists in each service, who would be career acquisition
specialists. Congress will also be asked to approve legislation to
upgrade the salaries and training of civilian acquisition officials.
   _Setting up an ethics council composed of the acquisitions chief
and the various service secretaries.
   Bush, who was in Warsaw on Monday, issued a statement supporting
Cheney's program. The president's letter accompanied the report to
congressional leaders.
   ``This report provides a basis for significant additional
improvements in the management of the Department of Defense and in
the defense acquisition process,'' Bush wrote. He added the
proposals would eliminate ``unnecessary management layers and
activities, a reform that will yield significant savings, which can
be applied to essential defense programs.''

<HEAD>Demonstrators Cheer Junta; Military Ruler Vows No Return to Democracy</HEAD>

   Thousands of Sudanese demonstrated support
for the nation's new military ruler Tuesday, cheering wildly as he
pledged no return to the multiparty democracy he overthrew last
month.
   ``Exterminate! Exterminate government by masters!'' the crowd
chanted, referring to the multiparty system under which ousted
civilian Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi had ruled since he won 1986
elections.
   ``Yes, yes. Government by masters will be exterminated,'' the
coup leader, Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir, responded in a
15-minute speech.
   Earlier Tuesday, el-Bashir set up four military tribunals, one a
court of appeals, to try el-Mahdi and about 45 other ousted
officials and politicians charged with corruption or mismanagement,
state radio reported.
   Heading a 15-member junta, el-Bashir, 45, toppled el-Mahdi in an
apparently bloodless coup June 30.
   He immediately dissolved parliament, disbanded political parties
and unions and declared a nationwide state of emergency. On Monday,
he declared himself prime minister and defense minister.
   Despite temperatures well into the 100s, Tuesday's demonstration
brought 20,000 to 30,000 people, mostly workers, to the presidential
palace along the Nile.
   ``One army! One nation!'' they shouted, frequently cheering and
applauding el-Bashir. ``We shall protect the revolution by hard
work.''
   The crowd burned an effigy marked ``sectarianism,'' in the shape
of a bearded man wearing the kind of robe used by followers of
el-Mahdi's Ansar sect. Ansar and Khatmiya are the principal Moslem
sects in Sudan.
   Khatmiya leader Mohammed Osman el-Mirghany, patron of the
Democratic Unionist Party, is among those under arrest. The
Unionists and el-Mahdi's Umma were the main partners in the ousted
coalition Cabinet.
   Tuesday's demonstration was sanctioned by el-Bashir's ruling
council, but el-Bashir told supporters there will be no more street
demonstrations. ``This is the first and the last,'' he said.
   El-Mahdi's government was rocked by street protests this year as
citizens wearied of a $1 million-a-day southern civil war that has
fueled food shortages, displaced hundreds of thousands and induced
famine that killed perhaps a quarter million people last year.
   El-Bashir has cited el-Mahdi's inability to end the war as one
reason for the coup.
   On Tuesday, a Sudanese delegation arrived in Addis Ababa and
asked the Ethiopian government to help settle the southern rebellion.
   Ethiopian state radio quoted delegation chief Lt. Col. Mohammed
el-Amin Khalifa as saying Sudan's new military government wants
Ethiopia to mediate with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army,
which the Addis Ababa government supports.
   Khalifa's five-man delegation was to meet President Mengistu
Haile Mariam and other Ethiopian leaders, the radio said.
   It also quoted Khalifa as saying he would meet with Sudanese
rebels ``if the situation is favorable.''
   El-Bashir says he is committed to peace, but he scrapped a
tentative accord approved by el-Mahdi's government, which included
meeting rebel preconditions for talks by suspending Sudan's harsh
Islamic laws and abrogating defense pacts with Libya and Egypt.
   The new leader says he seeks an eventual union with Egypt and
Libya.
   Northern Sudan is largely Moslem and leans toward the Arab world.
The rebels have been fighting for greater autonomy for the minority
Christians and animists of the south, who look to black, sub-Saharan
Africa.

   A 14-year-old mother smothered her month-old son
with a diaper because she was ``tired of the baby,'' police said
Tuesday.
   The unmarried mother, who was not identified, was charged in
Juvenile Court with murder, said Detective Joe Gorman.
   The girl was visiting the baby's paternal grandmother Monday when
the infant started to cry, Gorman said. The girl held her hand and
then a blanket over the baby's face but couldn't get him to stop
crying, he said.
   ``So she took the plastic side of the diaper and held it there
until the baby stopped crying and stopped moving,'' the detective
said.
   ``The mother went in and watched TV for awhile. The grandmother
went back and took a look and the baby was dead,'' Gorman said.
``She asked the arrestee what happened and (the girl) said she was

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laurence Olivier, the foremost actor of his
generation and leader of the giants of the English-speaking theater,
died today. He was 82.
   He died ``peacefully in his sleep,'' surrounded by friends and
relatives at his home south of London, said his agent, Laurence
Evans. The cause of death was not given.
   ``His last few days were very peaceful,'' said Richard Olivier,
the actor's 27-year-old son. ``He died in his sleep at noon.''
   The son spoke from the family home near the village of Ashurst,
50 miles south of London. He said a private funeral was planned,
followed by a public memorial service in London.
   ``It's hard to think of a world without Laurence Olivier, and now
it's happened, and it's hard to believe,'' said Rosemary Harris, who
appeared with Olivier in the National Theater production of Hamlet
in 1963 and in the film ``The Boys from Brazil.''
   ``He was the greatest actor of this century,'' said actor Anthony
Hopkins, who worked with Olivier in two films, ``A Bridge Too Far''
and ``The Bounty.''
   ``He would hurl himself into the role, and that can be quite
dangerous to limb and body. He had tremendous athletic daring,''
said Hopkins.
   Charlton Heston, a friend of Olivier who worked with him in the
1966 film ``Khartoum,'' said from his Los Angeles home that Olivier
``dared to go where few others venture.''
   Flags at the National Theater were lowered to half-staff but no
shows were canceled. ``That would have been the last thing he would
have wanted,'' said theater spokesman Stephen Wood.
   Olivier's last professional appearance was in the 1988 movie
``War Requiem,'' based on the oratorio by composer Benjamin Britten.
   Knighted, ennobled and revered by the film and theater world, he
was Lord Olivier when he died, one of the very few Britons to be
given a seat in the House of Lords for his acting prowess.
   His Hamlet, Henry V, Othello and Richard III were widely
acclaimed, as well as, at age 76, his performance for television of
King Lear. He was a tragic film hero in ``Wuthering Heights'' and
portrayed the painful experience of aging in ``The Entertainer'' on
stage and ``A Voyage Round My Father'' and ``Brideshead Revisited''
on television.
   At the same time, with ferocious will, he fought cancer, pleurisy
and a muscle disease that made even handshakes agony. He endured two
miserable marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright,
contemplated murder and suicide and battled his own rages, guilts
and drinking.
   On his 80th birthday, tributes flowed during a ceremony at the
National Theater, which he founded in 1963.
   ``Awe and wonder, you gave us awe and wonder,'' actress Dame
Peggy Ashcroft told him at the time. Director Peter Hall called him
``the genius performer.''
   For Olivier, life and acting were inseparable. ``I have to act to
breathe,'' he said.
   By turns, he loved and hated his craft _ but never would
contemplate retiring from it. Acting simply consumed him.
   He was forever searching for new ways to broaden his range and
reach the hearts of his audience. For instance, seeking to conjure
up Oedipus' abject cry of despair, he would imagine the cry of the
arctic ermine when it licks the salt laid down by its hunters and
its tongue sticks to the ice.
   Whatever sex drive he had, Olivier wrote in his 1982
autobiography ``Confessions of an Actor,'' went into his acting.
``You can't be more than one kind of athlete at a time. A sexual
athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of another
athletic kind.''
   Born May 22, 1907, in the town of Dorking southwest of London,
Laurence Kerr Olivier was the third child of an Anglican clergyman
who encouraged him to try acting.
   At age 10, he was Brutus in a school performance. At 15, he
donned women's clothes to play Katherine in a Stratford Festival
boys' production of ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
   After studying acting in Birmingham, his first professional role
was in 1922 in a sketch in a small touring company. In his first
London role, in Alice Law's 1924 ``Byron,'' he tripped over a
doorsill and fell on his face.
   His first marriage, to actress Jill Esmond in 1930, produced a
son but ended in divorce. Meanwhile, his career was soaring through
Noel Coward's ``Private Lives'' in London and New York, and
Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' in which he and John Gielgud
alternated playing Romeo and Mercutio.
   With Gielgud and Ralph Richardson, fellow knights-to-be, he
formed a partnership that re-made English theater.
   Olivier played a dazzling succession of Shakespearean triumphs _
Hamlet, Henry V, Macbeth. Movie stardom came in 1939 when he moved
to Hollywood and made ``Wuthering Heights.''
   In that same year, Olivier appeared with Vivien Leigh in a New
York production of ``Romeo and Juliet.'' After nearly two years of
clandestine love, he obtained a divorce and the two were wed.
   That marriage, glamorous in public, was another debacle. Leigh
soon fell out of love, had a series of affairs and descended into
manic depression that tormented Olivier. He had crippling bouts of
stage fright and contemplated suicide.
   They were divorced in 1961, and Olivier wed actress Joan
Plowright, with whom he finally found happiness. They had a son,
Richard, and two daughters, Tamsin and Julie-Kate. All three are
either studying or working in the theater.
   During World War II, he made the three films that sealed his
reputation as the finest Shakespearean actor in film: ``Henry V,''
``Hamlet,'' for which he won a best-actor Oscar in 1949, and
``Richard III.'' In 1979, he received a special Academy Award for
his film work.
   In the 1960s and 1970s he had scores of memorable roles, from the
fading comic Archie Rice in John Osborne's ``The Entertainer'' to
Astrov in Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' to the Nazi who tortures Dustin
Hoffman in the film ``Marathon Man.''
   Olivier was proudest of his founding of Britain's National
Theater. ``Only a man of his titanic standing and relentless energy
could have brought the project to fruition,'' wrote Alan Hamilton in
The Times.
   He was among a group of actors knighted for their work, but in
1971 was elevated to a peerage as Baron Olivier of Brighton. The
only other theatrical peer is actor and theater founder Bernard
Miles.
   Other actors knighted included Gielgud, Richardson, Ms. Ashcroft,
Judi Dench, Alec Guinness and Michael Redgrave.
   His last public performance was a tape-recorded speech with
extracts from Henry V, his contribution to a campaign to prevent
developers covering up the ruins of the Rose Theater in London,
where Shakespeare is thought to have acted.

   Two Air Force security policemen were
arrested in the theft of three F-16 jet fighter engines after an
undercover sting identified dozens of people suspected of stealing
military goods, the FBI said today.
   Indictments have been returned against 12 other people, but the
documents remained sealed in U.S. District Court and the FBI refused
to name them.
   The two-year investigation was aimed at the theft of military
goods, ``a very lucrative activity in the United States and, to some
extent, in Utah,'' said Robert Bryant, special agent in charge of
the agency's Utah office.
   Thefts of military equipment turned up by the investigation
included sleeping bags, helmets, canteens, munitions and firearms,
as well as the jet engines stolen July 3 from Hill Air Force Base,
said U.S. Attorney Dee Benson.
   None of the items included military systems or strategic weapons,
he said.
   ``The thefts at Hill ... appear to be part of a larger problem
involving other states and other military establishments.
Unfortunately, many of the participants are military policemen, and
we find that especially disturbing,'' Benson said.
   There was no evidence that the suspects believed they were
selling the jet engines to a foreign power, Benson said.
   ``It was just good, old-fashioned greed,'' Bryant said.
   Benson identified the men arrested at a restaurant Monday night
as Airman 1st Class Brian Roth of Ohio and Senior Airman Danny Joe
Stroud of Kansas. No hometowns or ages were immediately available.
   Benson said he expected ``many more'' arrests in coming weeks.
   Operation ``Punchout,'' a joint effort of the FBI, the Department
of Defense and the Air Force, targeted Hill and other unidentified
military installations in the Salt Lake Valley, Bryant said.
   The FBI established a storefront operation called ``Military
Surplus Brokers'' in Roy, near the northern Utah base, which bought
thousands of items stolen from all branches of the military, Bryant
said.
   He said the purchases resulted in ``the identification of more
than 100 suspects throughout the United States who are involved in
the theft and sale of stolen government property.''
   He said the government spent about $80,000 to purchase equipment
worth about $600,000. Bryant said the two suspects had been given a
down payment of $10,000 toward a purchase price of $300,000 for the
three Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, valued at $2 million each.
   The engines were reported missing last Wednesday by maintenance
personnel returning from the Independence Day holiday, base
officials said.
   The engines and a towing vehicle were returned to the Air Force
on Monday from a secret FBI storage facility in Salt Lake City after
being processed as evidence, FBI Agent Tim Screen said.

   The Lenin shipyard has become a symbol of
Poland's difficult fortunes in the postwar era.
   Rebuilt after World War II as a model of socialist Poland's
possibilities, it became famous in 1980 as the birthplace of
Solidarity but was declared inefficient last fall in the nation's
drive for economic reform.
   The sprawling yard, which President Bush visited Tuesday, has
been in decline since the late 1970s, when it produced a high of 27
ships yearly and had 15,000 employees.
   Hazardous work and poor living conditions have long made the
shipyard a hotbed of political and union activity. In 1970, security
police opened fire on workers protesting food price rises, killing
45, according to the official death toll.
   Ten years later, during a strike sparked by the firing of a
popular crane operator, Lech Walesa scaled a shipyard fence to lead
what became the first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc.
   Last Oct. 31, the government said the yard would be closed Dec.
1, 1989, because it was unprofitable. The shipyard employed about
10,000 when the closing was announced.
   The shipyard was the first major enterprise to be singled out for
dismantling by the then month-old government of Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who had said he would move swiftly to close
inefficient factories that drain off huge state subsidies.
   Walesa called the move a ``personal provocation ... against the
birthplace of Solidarity.''
   In the intervening months, the communist government, increasingly
aware that it could not control the economy or social unrest without
Solidarity, held reform talks with the union and agreed to restore
its legal status.
   On June 4, as Poles voted in their freest elections under
communist rule, a Polish-American businesswoman from New Jersey
joined with Walesa to announce a plan to save the shipyard.
   Barbara Piasecka Johnson, heir to the Johnson &amp; Johnson
pharmaceutical fortune, pledged up to $100 million to save the
shipyard.
   Under the plan, not yet finalized, Mrs. Johnson and her advisers
would own 55 percent of the prospective joint venture and the
management of the state-run enterprise would own 45 percent.

<HEAD>New Minnesota Law to Give Teachers More Control Over Their Profession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minnesota teachers will soon get more of a
say over who gets to teach with a new law that will put them at the
head of the class nationally in terms of self-regulation.
   A state law effective Aug. 1 gives teachers a majority of seats
on the Board of Teaching, which operates independently of the
Department of Education.
   The board grants licenses, sets standards, approves college
programs for teachers and monitors professional conduct.
   ``It's not just rearranging the chairs on the Titanic,'' said
Bella Rosenberg, assistant to president Albert Shanker of the
American Federation of Teachers in Washington. ``This has gone
farther than any other legislation we've seen.''
   She and other advocates of education reform say they hope the law
will lead to better preparation of new teachers and greater
accountability for the profession.
   A bill signed May 25 by Gov. Rudy Perpich reduces the board
created in 1973 from 15 to 11 members by attrition over the next few
years while keeping the six members who are teachers.
   The rest of the board will be made up of a higher education
faculty member, a school administrator, two current or former school
board members and one person with no connection to education.
   The governor appoints all board members. Bills that failed
recently in other states gave teacher unions the right to appoint
board members.
   ``You'll be a lighthouse of a new generation,'' said Ann McLaren,
program manager of the National Education Association's instruction
and professional development division.
   The 20,000-member Minnesota Federation of Teachers and some Board
of Teaching members wonder why it took so long to give teachers the
kind of control over their field that other professions enjoy.
   ``That's been our argument, that all other professional boards _
hairdressers and barbers _ have a majority,'' said Jean Carlstrom,
vice chairman of the Board of Teaching and a special-education
teacher. ``Because everyone's been to school they think they're an
authority on education.''
   The Minnesota School Boards Association opposed the original bill
but supported the final version because of an amendment giving the
Legislature final say over the creation of any new licensing
categories.
   ``We thought the public would be well served to keep control of
that ability to remove licenses and grant licenses for teachers,''
said Bob Meeks, the association's associate director for legislative
services.
   Unlike doctors and lawyers who regulate their professions,
teachers have a ``captive audience,'' he said.
   The Board of Teaching already is working on rules to require
colleges to better prepare teachers to recognize which students need
special attention, Carlstrom said. It also is considering increasing
the student teaching requirement to one year from one quarter, she
said.
   ``If this board succeeds in setting high standards and sticking
to them and helping to rethink the way teachers are prepared ... it
will accomplish an enormous amount. But that's a very tall order,''
Rosenberg said.
   But she added: ``I'm optimistic.''

   President Bush today made a dramatic
pilgrimage to the birthplace of the Solidarity labor movement and
told cheering thousands their struggle had produced ``a time when
dreams can live again'' in the democratic transformation of Poland.
   ``For those who say that freedom can forever be denied, I say let
them look at Poland,'' the president said in the emotional climax of
a two-day visit.
   ``Poland is not alone. America stands with you,'' he said,
renewing his pledge to help the Poles redeem their shattered economy
and seek greater political freedoms. ``America stands shoulder to
shoulder with the Polish people in solidarity.''
   ``Long live Bush!'' came back the reply from the crowd of 25,000
people. Another 25,000 lined the streets of this seaport to cheer
Bush's motorcade, and some threw flower petals at his limousine.
   The president was introduced to the chanting, flag-waving
audience by Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who said he hoped the
visiting American realized ``our country should and deserves to be
helped. ... God Bless America. May God bless our homeland,'' Walesa
said.
   The speech concluded, Bush and Walesa stood together to accept
the cheers of the crowd, then turned to the monument to slain
workers and held up their hands in a V-for-Victory sign favored by
the union movement.
   Later, Bush flew to Hungary, another Communist country in the
throes of extraordinary political and economic reform. He travels to
Paris on Thursday for the economic summit, followed by a trip next
week to the Netherlands.
   Scrapping his prepared text in Budapest, Bush told the crowd that
waited in the rain in Kossuth Square to greet him: ``I salute the
leaders oif Hungary. I salute the reforms and change that is taking
place in this wonderful country.''
   ``We want to work with Hungary to continue the changes and
reforms,'' said Bush.
   After the shipyard speech, Bush joined Communist Party leader
Wojciech Jaruzelski and laid a wreath at the Westerplatte Monument
commemorating where the first shots of World War II were fired.
   At the airport, Jaruzelski hailed the departing president as ``an
experienced and far-sighted statesman who attracts warm feelings,''
and thanked him for ``the sincere and partner-like character of the
talks we held. We have sown new seeds.''
   Bush made the trip to the Solidarity Workers Monument outside the
main gate to the Lenin shipyard after a private lunch at Walesa's
home.
   The president said Walesa had asked for private investment
assistance in their talks. ``I can give strong support for that
standing right here in his yard,'' Bush said.
   Later, introducing Bush at the Solidarity monument, Walesa said
Poland needs help to keep its economic reforms from failing. If that
happened, he said, ``it would be a failure of democracy'' and would
have a destabilizing effect throughout Eastern Europe.
   On Monday, Bush had outlined a program of $115 million in U.S.
aid and proposed easier repayment terms for Poland's $39 billion
international debt.
   He said he would take Walesa's call for private investment to the
economic summit starting Friday in Paris, and ``we'll see where we
come out.''
   Shouts of ``Welcome President Bush!'' rang out and hand-held
American flags fluttered in the air as the president arrived at the
monument to Polish workers killed in an uprising in 1970 during the
birth of the labor movement. Thousands lined the route of his
motorcade, then massed at the monument to hear Bush's pledge to
stand with Poland.
   Bush stressed that hard work and sacrifice are still ahead for
Poles as they try to rebuild their economy.
   But his main message was one of help and hope that their 40-year
struggle _ first against the Nazis, then against Communist
suppression _ will realize the ``ancient dream'' of freedom. And he
did so by referring to President Kennedy's dramatic speech at the
Berlin Wall 26 years ago.
   In grimmer times, Kennedy had stood outside the barrier between
East and West and said that if anyone thought Communism was the wave
of the future, ``Let them come to Berlin.''
   Bush put it this way:
   ``Today to those who think that hopes can be forever suppressed,
I say let them look at Poland. To those who think that freedom can
be forever denied, I say, let them look at Poland. And to those who
think that dreams can be forever repressed, I say let them look at
Poland _ for here, in Poland, the dream is alive.
   ``It is here in Poland where we can work to end the division of
Europe. It is in your power to help end the division of Europe,''
Bush said. ``The people of Poland can show the world what a free
people with commitment and energy can accomplish.''
   Walesa and the crowd seemed reluctant to let the president go.
   Bush urged Poles to stay in their country and help with
rebuilding, rather then emigrate as so many thousands have done over
the years. ``Stay with us. Stay with us,'' they asked him.
   Standing in Walesa's backyard after lunch, Bush said, ``I clearly
salute'' his accomplishments toward democratic reforms and ``want to
work with him and Poland'' to achieve economic reforms.
   Walesa, who wore a silver Solidarity pin on his black tie, told
reporters, ``We're not after any loans. We're after cooperation.''
   He said that if Western banks could open branches in Poland with
$10 billion and ``could strike a good deal in Poland, that would fix
our economic problem.''
   ``This is what I asked Mr. President about. That was my primary
appeal and request,'' Walesa said.
   Earlier Walesa said in an ABC-TV interview that Bush's $115
million aid proposals ``don't really help.'' The Solidarity leader
said: ``It's just a sort of a drop in the bucket. We need shock
treatment.''
   The crowd at the Solidarity monument, which included miners in
black uniforms with tall, feather-topped black hats, chanted ``Lech
Walesa! Lech Walesa!'' and ``Solidarity! Solidarity!''
   Crowned by three crosses topped with anchors, the Solidarity
monument commemorates the first three shipyard workers killed by
government security forces during 1970 strikes over food prices in
which hundreds are believed to have died. Officially, the death toll
was 45.
   Earlier, during a brief visit to the 14th century Oliva Cathedral
in suburban Gdansk, Bush was greeted by several thousand flag-waving
Poles who sang ``May You Live 100 Years'' and tossed red and white
roses and carnations at his motorcade.
   When he left the cathedral for the ride to Walesa's home, the
president stood on his limousine's running board and waved to crowds
chanting ``Solidarity! Solidarity!''

   Dave Winfield's first court-ordered child support
payment is due Saturday, but lawyers for the New York Yankees
outfielder say they will appeal.
   A jury ruled last month that Sandra Renfro, a Houston flight
attendant and mother of Winfield's 6-year-old daughter, was his
common-law wife from 1982 to 1985.
   District Judge Allen J. Daggett on Monday ordered Winfield to pay
Sandra Renfro $13,500 a month in temporary support and child
support, her $210,000 in legal fees and half of the expenses and
taxes on her car and condominium.
   Support payments for Ms. Renfro begin Aug. 5.
   Dennis Kelly, a lawyer for Winfield, said he will appeal.
   ``I've always taken care of my child, but I contend I was never
married to the lady,'' Winfield said Monday.

   Harrison Ford says he understands why his fans
are interested in his every move.
   ``People think celebrities have gotten away with something,''
Ford says in the August issue of Redbook. ``We've escaped from the
pack, from the daily grind. The public appoints us to be symbols of
success.''
   ``I'm very uncomfortable when people stare at me, but I think
I've learned how to deal with that. I try to think of those people
as satisfied customers and that's why they're approaching me,'' he
said.
   Ford knows about the flip side of fame. After bit parts in such
TV series as ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Ironside'' and ``The Virginian'' and a
role in the 1970 flop ``Zabriskie Point,'' he became a carpenter.
   ``I became somebody other than an out-of-work actor,'' he said.
``I was now a carpenter, so whenever I went to an audition or met an
agent, I wasn't worried about getting the acting job.''
   George Lucas cast Ford in ``American Graffiti'' in 1972. But Ford
didn't hang up his carpenter's tools until the 1976 blockbuster,
``Star Wars.''
   ``I always knew that if I was going to make it, it was going to
take a long time,'' said Ford, 47. ``I knew there was no such thing
as an `overnight success.' So I hung in there.''

   Lauren Chapin has been a 4-year-old sex-abuse
victim, a 16-year-old bride, a 17-year-old alcoholic, a heroin
addict, a call girl, a check forger and an unmarried mother.
   She also was a star as a teen-ager in ``Father Knows Best,''
playing ``Kitten'' on the 1950s series. It is that role that gives
her inspiration in her current role as a happily married mother and
minister at the age of 44.
   ``I have nothing but admiration for the message of `Father Knows
Best.' I'm trying to raise my family like the Andersons _ I believe
the father should be the head of the household, the mom should be
home nurturing the kids and the whole family should attend church,''
she said in the August issue of Redbook.
   Her upbringing is detailed in her autobiography, ``Father Does
Know Best: The Lauren Chapin Story,'' to be published in August.
   In it, she says that her father sexually abused her for two years
and that she was insulted and ignored by her alcoholic mother to the
point where she tried to commit suicide at age 11. The book recounts
Ms. Chapin's slide into crime and addiction, the birth of her two
children and her religious rebirth.
   She lives in Texas with her children and her husband, a
firefighter.

   Danny Glover thinks his character in this
summer's action-smash ``Lethal Weapon II'' should have been sexier.
   In the film, Glover's wife is played by Darlene Love, but the two
are never shown in romantic situations.
   ``You know, he could at least be seen kissing her. Or holding
her,'' Glover said. ``I think that in real life I probably bore my
own daughter, the way I'm always hugging and kissing her mama.''
   Glover, 40, and his wife, Asake, live in San Francisco with their
daughter, Mandisa.
   In ``Lethal Weapon II,'' Glover plays Roger Murtaugh, a cop with
a reckless partner played by Mel Gibson. If there is a sequel,
Glover sees his character leaving his wife, having an affair, then
coming to his senses and returning home.
   ``What do you think?'' Glover asked. ``Doesn't that make Murtaugh
sound just a little more interesting, a little more human?''

<HEAD>Government Asks U.N. Troops Block Returning Radical Student</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government asked U.N. forces to
block a radical South Korean student who plans to cross the border
from North Korea as a symbol of national unification, news reports
said Tuesday.
   The head of South Korea's governing party said there will be
trouble if North Korea permits Im Su-kyong to walk through the truce
village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone.
   Park Jyun-kyu, chairman of the governing Democratic Justice
Party, said the action ``will raise havoc on the present military
status quo at the (military) demarcation line'' that separates the
two Koreas,'' but he did not elaborate.
   Miss Im, who in defiance of her government traveled to North
Korea via Europe to attend a youth festival, said she would enter
Panmunjom on July 27, anniversary of the cease-fire that ended the
Korean War.
   The government has said it will arrest Miss Im, 20, on charges of
national security violations for an illegal trip to North Korea, but
newspapers said officials believed the arrest should not take place
at the border because it could increase political tension.
   Seoul says dialogue with the communist government in Pyongyang
must be conducted only through government or authorized channels.
   The semi-official South Korean news agency Yonhap said the
government has asked the United Nations Command guarding the border
to stop Miss Im at Panmunjom, where some of the 43,000 U.S. troops
in South Korea are garrisoned.
   The command, highly sensitive to any issue involving politics
between the nations, refused comment on the reports.
   Under the armistice, no one can cross the DMZ without prior
agreement from both sides, but if allowed access to the area, it
would be simple to walk from one nation to the other at Panmunjom
because there are few barriers. It was not clear how the command was
expected to stop Miss Im.
   The peninsula was divided into North Korea and South Korea in
1945, and the nations fought the 1950-53 Korean War and have
remained archrivals despite their talks in the past 18 years for
reconciliation.
   Park, in Tokyo on his way back to Seoul from a visit to Canada,
said he believes the student will return home ``via other routes,''
adding it is North Korea ``who is afraid of breaking the demarcation
line.''
   Some South Korean dissidents and radical students claim Seoul is
insincere in its attempt to seek unification. They also demand the
overthrow of the government of President Roh Tae-woo and withdrawal
of U.S. troops from South Korea, saying they hinder unification
talks.
   The only mutually acceptable crossings in the last 36 years have
been delegates to talks by the two nations and about 150 people from
each side who took part in a 1985 home visitation program allowing
Koreans on either side to visit relatives.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
cautioned Tuesday against strict protectionist legislation to help
the declining U.S. defense industry, saying the country can't ``go
it alone'' technologically.
   ``If we protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, we
reduce the incentive to invest in modern facilities and advanced
technologies, and we deprive ourselves of access to advances in
technology being achieved in foreign countries,'' Carlucci told the
Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.
   Congress is weighing renewal of the Defense Production Act, which
expires Sept. 30. The 39-year-old act gives the federal government
authority to subsidize industries, including those that produce
goods for the Pentagon. It also gives the president the power to
limit or prohibit the acquisition of foreign products.
   In the House, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, has introduced an
amendment that would limit participation of foreign comapanies in
defense manufacturing and provide financial assistance to
medium-size and small defense companies.
   Recent studies have shown a decline in domestic sources of
defense production. Specifically, the Center for Strategic and
International Studies found that from 1987 to 1982 the number of
companies suppling goods to the Defense Department dropped from
118,000 to 38,000.
   Adm. Bobby Inman, former deputy director of the CIA, told the
Senate panel that immediate action is necessary because of the
erosion of the defense industrial base.
   ``I should have put my money into T-bills instead of defense
production activities,'' Inman said.
   But the former CIA official said the House legislation is an
``unwise approach,'' and suggested limiting the use of domestic-only
suppliers on specific items.
   Robert B. Costello, former undersecretary for defense
acquisition, told the Senate committee that since the U.S. defense
industry uses foreign parts and technology, the Pentagon cannot
arbitrarily ban the use of any foreign supplied material.
   Carlucci said a move toward protectionism ``invites retaliation.
It could be disastrous to our national security, if we assume we can
`go it alone' technologically.''
   Asked by Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., if an presidential advisory
committee was needed, Carlucci said such a panel would not solve the
problem.
   ``The government should take a more active role in encouraging
adoption of improved manufacturing processess throughout our
industrial base, not just among defense contractors,'' Carlucci said.
   He also suggested favorable tax policies and long-term investment
in defense programs.

<HEAD>Emigres: Passports Confiscated of Former Foreign Minister, Activists</HEAD>

   Czechoslovak authorities confiscated the
passports of more than 20 activists, including a former foreign
minister who said on a Scandinavian visit that reform in his country
was too slow, emigre sources said Tuesday.
   The sources in the Austrian capital, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Czechoslovak officials on July 4 revoked the
passport of Jiri Hajek, who served as foreign minister during the
1968 ``Prague Spring'' reform period that was crushed by Soviet
troops.
   More than 20 independent activists had their passports
confiscated last month, the sources said.
   The Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten quoted Hajek, who is also a
member of the Charter 77 human rights group, as saying he was told
the passport was revoked ``because it wasn't in the interest of the
state for me to have travel documents and be able to travel abroad
now.''
   The emigre sources said Hajek appealed the decision.
   Hajek was told the measure was taken due to interviews granted to
Western media while he was abroad and his attendance at a meeting of
the Socialist International in Stockholm June 20-22, the sources
said.
   Hajek gave a series of interviews to Swedish media and held a
news conference at the airport when he arrived in Norway May 11 at
which he criticized the Czechoslovak regime for being slow to
implement reforms.
   He also visited his son who is studying in Oslo and is not
permitted to travel to Czechoslovakia.
   Rut Sormova, a signatory of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto
and a member of the Independent Peace Association, also had her
passport revoked before a planned visit to Spain to attend a
congress of European Peace movements. She was then to travel on to
Budapest, Hungary, for an East-West dialogue, the sources said.
   Two weeks ago, authorities seized the passport of the wife of
dissident playwright Vaclav Havel. She had been planning to visit
friends in Vienna.

   President Bush arrived in Hungary today
to a rainstorm that led him to tear up his opening remarks and tell
well-wishers ``I feel the warmth of this welcome and the rain
doesn't make a darn bit of difference.''
   Bush, the first U.S. president ever to visit Hungary, told the
crowd in Kossuth Square, ``we have in our country a special
affection and feeling for the people of Hungary.''
   In his meetings with Hungarian leaders, Bush said, ``I will be
bringing them the warm greetings from the American people and the
convictions of the people of the United States that we must work
with Hungary, we want to work with Hungary to continue the changes
and the reforms going forward in your great country.''
   Bush said he scrapped his opening speech and decided to speak
``from the heart'' because the crowd had been out in the rain too
long.
   ``You'll have to listen to me tomorrow, I'm sure, at some drier
time and some drier place,'' he said, adding:
   ``Long after this rain is gone, I am going to remember the warmth
of the welcome from the people of Hungary.''
   On Kossuth Square, workers had to hastily repair wind damage
caused by a fierce thunderstorm that turned the sky pitch black 75
minutes before Air Force One landed at Ferihegy Airport.
   One bannr hoisted in the square by an anti-government group said,
``Don't give money to communists.''
   As President Bruno F. Straub greeted Bush at some length, the
U.S. president drew warm applause for helping wife Barbara into a
raincoat.
   Straub told Bush Hungary is convinced that his visit means his
country's current reforms have ``the sympathy and support of the
American people'' and noted that international relations had
improved since Bush's visit as vice president in 1983.
   Then, Straub said, East-West relations were characterized by ``an
almost total lack of East-West dialogue.''
   Now, he noted, Hungary is ``getting similar words of
encouragement from East and West alike and we do need these very
much.''
   The welcoming ceremony took place on a large square near the
Danube River named after Lajos Kossuth, the hero of Hungary's failed
1848 revolt against its then Austrian rulers.
   Kossuth is a symbol both of the nation's long fight for freedom
and its affection for the United States, where Kossuth was hailed as
a hero during an 1851-52 visit. Kossuth was an orator of reknown,
and Abraham Lincoln reportedly borrowed some of his words for the
Gettysburg Address.
   Bush journeyed here from Poland. His next stop on Thursday is
Paris for the economic summit, followed by a visit to the
Netherlands Monday and Tuesday before returning to Washington.

<HEAD>Pickens Says Japanese Keep Corporate Affairs Closed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate raider T. Boone Pickens Jr. told
Congress Tuesday the Japanese are resisting his foray into corporate
ownership there to prevent him from exposing a closed, monopolistic
economy.
   The millionaire Texas oilman, known for his often hostile raids
on U.S. companies, purchased a 20.2 percent stake in Koito
Manufacturing Co., an automobile lighting company, for $800 million.
But he was rebuffed two weeks ago at a shareholders' meeting in
Tokyo when he sought three seats on Koito's 20-member board.
   Pickens said he poses no threat to the company's management
because the web of interconnected stockholders, including Koito's
customers, can easily outvote him.
   ``They must want to exclude me so that an American won't see how
their cartel works. They don't want their system exposed for what it
is,'' Pickens told the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation.
   In fact, he said the Japanese may be exporting their system of
close links between companies and suppliers when they build
factories in the United States.
   ``American suppliers are already complaining that they cannot get
a piece of the action,'' he said.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the panel and a
strong advocate of an aggressive trade policy, praised Pickens for
having given the committee a ``wonderful understanding'' of the
barriers Japan erects to outside investment.
   ``This is a matter of policy. ... They try to finesse it with the
word `culture.' They've got the same culture you and I've got _
money talks,'' Hollings said.
   Picken's testimony came as the committee considered a bill,
sponsored by Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa., and Rep. John Bryant,
D-Texas. It would require foreign investors to register with the
Department of Commerce when they purchase more than a 5 percent
stake in a U.S. company or real estate valued at more than $5
million.
   According to a report issued by the Commerce Department in June,
foreign holdings in the United States have tripled since 1980 to
$1.79 trillion, $533 billion more than Americans own abroad, making
the United States the world's largest debtor.
   Great Britain held the largest stake in the United States,
followed by Japan and the Netherlands.
   Harkin said under the current system of tracking foreign
investment it is often impossible to determine the true ownership of
individual companies and properties. Ownership is often cloaked
through shell corporations under the current system of tracking and
Harkin said he fears some of the investment represents recycled drug
profits.
   He also said the government needs better information to determine
whether or not foreigners are acquiring too much control over
strategic industries, such as oil and chemicals.
   Commerce Undersecretary Michael R. Darby said the Harkin-Bryant
bill would compromise the anonymity of foreign firms reporting
information to the U.S. government and discourage foreign
investment, which the administration welcomes because it helps
modernize U.S. industry.
   ``Enactment of this proposal would ultimately increase the cost
of capital in the U.S., and result in slower economic growth, weaker
productivity performance, lower rates of employment and American
products which are less competitive in world markets,'' he said.
   Darby said the administration prefers, with some adjustments, a
bill sponsored by Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, which imposes
no new reporting requirements but provides for more sharing among
government agencies of currently collected data.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the influential National
Association of Manufacturers, said his lobby group also opposes the
Harkin-Bryant measure. He said he did not believe it would give U.S.
negotiators any leverage to lower Japanese barriers.
   Pickens supported the bill, saying he was required to file an
extensive report with the Japanese government before he purchased
his share of Koito.

<TEXT>
   Britain mourned Laurence Olivier with tributes and
fond memories Tuesday, and theaters from London's West End to the
birthplace of Shakespeare lowered their flags and ordered their
lights doused for an hour.
   Queen Elizabeth II sent condolences to Olivier's family, who were
at the actor's bedside when he died peacefully at the age of 82 at
his home in the village of Ashurst.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher praised his ``extraordinary
talents'' and remembered her favorite Olivier roles in ``Hamlet,''
``Henry V'' and ``Richard III.''
   ``We are taking out all display lights in our theaters from 9
p.m. to 10 p.m. as a measure of respect for the death of a national
institution,'' said Louis Benjamin, head of a 12-theater group in
the West End, London's equivalent of Broadway.
   The National Theater, of which Olivier was a founding father,
lowered its flags, removed its normal playbill from its electronic
billboard overlooking the River Thames, and replaced it with
``LAURENCE OLIVIER 1907-1989.''
   No shows were canceled, however. ``That would have been the last
thing he would have wanted,'' said theater spokesman Stephen Wood.
   Flags also were lowered at theaters in Stratford, birthplace of
Shakespeare whose works Olivier defined for modern mass audiences.
   ``It isn't too much to say that Olivier was perhaps the greatest
man of the theater ever,'' said Sir Peter Hall, who succeeded
Olivier as head of the National Theater in 1973. ``Larry Olivier's
genius shaped the last 50 years.''
   Actor Sir Richard Attenborough said: ``He was above the crowd. He
was a lion of a man.''
   Rosemary Harris, who had several stage and screen roles opposite
Olivier, said: ``It's hard to think of a world without Laurence
Olivier.''
   Some remarked on his physical courage. Actor Anthony Hopkins
remembered ``his capacity to electrify people; he would hurl himself
into the role, and that can be quite dangerous to limb and body. He
had tremendous athletic daring.''
   Hopkins also praised Olivier's openness to new young talents.
   ``I remember him telling me: `Never be afraid to be outrageous.'
   ``He said: `You will always be shot down in flames because people
are going to dislike you whatever you do. It is your fear of being
criticized that stops you being outrageous.'''
   Denis Quilley, who acted with Olivier in the 1971 production of
Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' recalled how
night after night audiences would gasp in shock as Olivier, already
64, threw himself backward off a table.
   British TV personality Melvyn Bragg, one of the last to interview
Olivier extensively, said: ``He was as English as his own vicarage
family, a man of a thousand faces, a powerful, dangerous and sexy
presence on every stage, and in some memorable films.''
   ``OLIVIER DIES'' cried the newsbills, and evening newspapers sold
fast when rush-hour commuters saw the headline.
   ``He was a very great actor of extraordinary power,'' said
Michael Denton, a physician. ``Whenever I thought of him or heard
his name I saw his stooped figure in black as `Richard III.'''
   Pat Fairbairn, a civil servant standing in line for a bus, said:
``Olivier summed up the English theater. He had that lovely,
dignified voice.
   ``What impressed me was that his professional colleagues always
spoke of him with such great respect and admiration,'' Fairbairn
said. ``When they played Shakespeare it always seemed to me that
they were tying to live up to Olivier.''
   Joanne James, a young London actress, looked crushed when she
heard the news. ``I'm sad,'' she said. ``He's been a symbol to
everybody, with the energy and dedication he has put into the
theater. I've grown up with him.''

<HEAD>State Radio Says Winnie Mandela Linked to Teen-ager's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have given prosecutors a
report linking black activist Winnie Mandela to the death of a
teen-ager allegedly killed by her bodyguards, state radio said
Tuesday.
   Eight of Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards have been charged with the
murder of 14-year-old activist Moeketsi ``Stompie'' Seipei who was
beaten to death last December in Soweto, the sprawling black
township outside Johannesburg.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of jailed black leader Nelson Mandela, denies
involvement in the case and says it is a government smear campaign.
   The attorney general of Witwatersrand region is to examine the
police report and decide whether additional charges should be filed,
the South African Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   It quoted an unidentified spokesman for the attorney general as
saying the report linked Mrs. Mandela to Seipei's death. It did not
say how Mrs. Mandela allegedly was involved or if the police report
included any new information.
   A lawyer for the Mandela family, Ismail Ayob, said he has not
seen the police report and is not aware of its contents.
   Seipei and three young black men allegedly were abducted from a
church sanctuary in December, taken to Mrs. Mandela's home and
assaulted. Seipei's body was found in a Soweto field Jan. 7, police
said.
   Soweto community leaders have said the other three men were freed
from the house only after intense community pressure. A lawyer for
the three has said they have prepared affidavits asserting Mrs.
Mandela was ``involved'' in their abduction.
   Anti-apartheid groups have disowned Mrs. Mandela and accused her
bodyguards, known as Mandela United soccer club and now disbanded,
of waging a ``reign of terror'' in Soweto.
   Mandela United members rarely played soccer, but regularly
accompanied Mrs. Mandela to public appearances and were involved in
repeated confrontations with police, journalists and other groups of
black youths.
   Anti-apartheid groups emphasize they remain loyal to Mandela, the
best known leader among South Africa's 28 million blacks.
   Mandela's meeting July 5 with President P.W. Botha has reignited
speculation that he soon may be released after more than 27 years in
prison.
   Mrs. Mandela visited her husband Monday at Victor Verster Prison
outside Cape Town, but refused to comment. She indicated her husband
sought to release his own statement. Botha has not commented on the
meeting and the Prisons Service has refused to say whether it would
release a statement by Mandela.
   Mandela, 70, was sentenced to life imprisonment on charges of
plotting to overthrow the government.

<HEAD>Kemp Pledge `Zero Tolerance' for Abuses at HUD</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf with 2 new grafs to UPDATE with Kemp testifying.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD L. VERNACI</BYLINE>

   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp today pledged
``zero tolerance'' for thievery and influence peddling at the
scandal-ridden Department of Housing and Urban Development that he
inherited this year.
   ``What I could not anticipate three months ago was the extent to
which I had inherited a legacy of abuse and mismanagement, fraud and
favoritism in certain HUD programs,'' Kemp said in testimony before
a congressional panel.
   Kemp was warmly received by his former colleagues in the House.
Unlike all the other witnesses who have appeared before the panel in
its HUD investigation, he was not asked to testify under oath.
   Kemp denounced the practice that prevailed during the Reagan
administration, when developers hired well-known Republicans to act
as ``consultants'' to help secure HUD funds to fix up housing for
the poor. He said that practice helped inflate the cost of the
projects.
   ``That extra money goes for excess profits for the developer and,
clearly, to cover consultant fees,'' he said.
   Developers and consultants testifying before Congress all have
denied that taxpayers' money was used to pay their fees, sometimes
in six figures.
   ``The Department of Housing and Urban Development will maintain a
policy of zero tolerance for violations of our standards of
conduct,'' Kemp told the House Government Operations subcommittee on
housing and employment.
   In addition to influence peddling, federal investigators are
looking into the possible theft of as much as $20 million by a dozen
private closing agents around the country who failed to hand over
money to the government they collected for the sale of foreclosed
properties.
   One such agent, Marilyn Harrell of Maryland, has publicly
confessed taking more than $5 million, but said she gave some of it
to the poor, earning her the nickname ``Robin HUD.''
   ``People who steal from this program are not Robin Hood type
heroes, as some have protrayed them, and they aren't `robbing the
rich','' Kemp said. ``They are stealing from the taxpayer and
depriving low and moderate income people of the opportunity to
realize the American dream of home ownership.''
   HUD, meanwhile, has reassigned four employees of its Washington
field office pending investigations of their role in apparent
mismanagement that officials believe cost the government about $10
million.
   That investigation is part of a Kemp-ordered review of virtually
all major HUD programs.
   Kemp has suspended three HUD programs and said last week there
may be more suspensions as he examines the agency's operations.
   He has promised he will not use HUD's problems to curtail the
federal government's role in housing.
   ``I think Kemp is going to do the right thing, by and large,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``The big thing is that we have
somebody in there who cares about the programs instead of waging an
all-out war on the programs.''
   The congressional investigation of HUD may expand to the Senate,
where the Banking Committee plans a Thursday vote on whether to
launch its own inquiry.
   The four Washington field office workers who were reassigned,
including the office's former director, will be placed for up to 90
days in non-management positions at four separate offices at HUD
headquarters, agency spokesman Robert Nipp said Monday.
   The four were placed on 30-day administrative leave at the start
of the investigation last month. That period expired Monday and HUD
officials decided to give the four 90-day temporary assignments as
the investigation continues.
   An audit of the Washington field office uncovered lax financial
and management controls that allowed private closing agents hired by
HUD to handle single-family property to delay payments to the
government and in some cases not make them at all.
   The four workers are I. Margaret White, who had headed the
district field office for five years; Robert B. Warner, its director
of housing management; Charles W. Womble, a loan specialist in the
single-family home divisions; and Everett Rothschild, who headed the
field office's property disposition division.
   The field office oversees HUD properties in the District of
Columbia and parts of Maryland and Virginia.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout to UPDATE with Coast Guard identifying Valdez
as likely source of oil slick. No Pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil inside the hull of the crippled tanker Exxon
Valdez, washed away by the sea, was the likely source of a 10-mile
oil sheen off the Southern California coast, a Coast Guard official
said today.
   Concern about the offshore oil slick and the discovery of five
flaps of steel hanging from the bottom of the tanker will delay the
disabled tanker's entry into San Diego Bay at least several days.
   Preliminary results of test samples taken from the oil slick have
not yet confirmed that the oil came from the tanker, said U.S. Coast
Guard Cmdr. Jack Scarborough, captain of the Port of San Diego.
   However, Scarborough said, Exxon officials agreed that the Exxon
Valdez was the likely source.
   Although Exxon officials had maintained the inside of the tanker
was thoroughly cleaned before it began the journey from Valdez,
Scarborough said: ``They were wrong. The ship is not squeaky clean.
That's a discrepancy I can't explain.''
   The oil slick today was about 10 miles long and 25 yards wide,
Scarborough said, smaller than the 18-mile-long sheen visible from
the air Monday.
   Because oil floats, officials planned to flood the tanker's cargo
tanks with seawater, pushing the residual oil up inside the vessel,
Scarborough said.
   Once the leaking oil problem has been resolved, the tanker can be
brought in to calm waters so divers can repair the flaps of steel
hanging as much as 40 feet beneath the tanker.
   The ship that spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil off Alaska
was about 50 miles southwest of Point Loma today, Scarborough said.
   The tanker moved slowly under its own power while Coast Guard
officials reviewed test results of samples taken from the oil in the
ocean, Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg said.
   ``She's not going anywhere,'' Solberg said of the tanker. ``We've
told them they can't come any closer.''
   Exxon Shipping Co. spokeswoman Carrie Chassin said she was not
sure when the Valdez would be cleared to dock.
   The 987-foot ship, damaged March 24 when it smashed into a reef
in Alaska's Prince William Sound, is to be repaired at National
Steel and Shipbuilding Co., where it was built in 1986.
   The tanker, under tow since leaving Alaska on June 23, had an
uneventful trip until the final leg of its 2,500-mile journey.
During the Coast Guard's inspection, an underwater camera showed
that five metal plates had peeled away from the hull and were
hanging from the frame.
   The loose steel increased the vessel's draft to as much as 65
feet, making it impossible for it to travel through a San Diego Bay
channel averaging 40 feet in depth, Solberg said.
   ``This all happened in transit,'' he said. ``It wasn't this way
when they left. There are pieces of the steel shell plating, the
hull itself, that have basically been torn away due to the wave
action.''
   Also Monday, officials downgraded the amount of oil spilled when
a Greek tanker ran aground June 23 off Newport, R.I., to one-fifth
the original estimate of 1.6 million gallons.
   In Boston, Gary Ott, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, said less than 300,000 gallons of No. 2 heating oil
spilled from the World Prodigy off Rhode Island.
   Officials said the initial estimates were wrong because the
remaining oil from the tanker was mixed with water when it was
removed.
   In Philadelphia, the captain and eight crew members of a
Uruguayan tanker that spilled more than 300,000 of heavy heating oil
into the Delaware River on June 24 tested negative for drugs, their
lawyer, Raymond Letulle said Monday. The urine tests were taken the
day after the spill, he said.
   The Coast Guard boarded the Presidente Rivera right after the
accident and ``saw no evidence that there was any problem with
alcohol,'' Letulle said.

<HEAD>US Says Nicaragua Harassing, Reporters, Political Opposition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department accused the Nicaraguan
government of harassing reporters, opposition figures and observers
and called for a halt so elections set for next year can be
credible, a department spokesman said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said the United States is ``very
concerned about the way things are going in Nicaragua,'' where
elections are scheduled for February.
   ``Sandinista harassment of the press, the opposition and
observers, whether done through brute force or through the use of
transparent legalisms, must cease if the elections scheduled for
February 1990 are to command respect both within Nicaragua and
internationally,'' Boucher said at a regular briefing.
   ``We urge the Sandinistas to reconsider their current course of
action,'' he said.
   Nicaragua and other Central American nations signed a peace
accord calling for the elections last February. Under the agreement,
the U.S.-backed Contra rebels opposed to the Sandinistas are to be
abolished.
   Boucher cited three recent instances in Nicaragua that he said
were inconsistent with the Sandinista's ``professed commitment'' to
a pluralistic society.
   First, he said a Sandinista mob attacked two correspondents from
La Prensa with rocks and rotten eggs on June 20 in the city of Leon.
   On July 7, the Sandinistas expelled Nicaraguan-born Antonio
Ibarra Rojas, a sociology professor at Dubuque University in Iowa
who had come to Managua as an electoral observer on behalf of
Freedom House, a human rights group.
   Finally, Boucher said, the Sandinistas denied permission to the
United Nicaraguan Opposition to hold a march in the city of Ocotal
on the grounds that UNO is not a political party.
   ``The United Nicaraguan Opposition, of course, is the umbrella
organization of democratic parties from right to left which oppose
Sandinista repression,'' Boucher said.
   He refused to say whether the Sandinistas' recent actions could
jeopardize an agreement on aid to the Contras forged this spring
between Congress and the White House. The issue is likely to surface
this fall in Congress, he said.
   The Bush admninistration, in a break with the previous
administration, worked out a compromise with Congress to give the
Contras $49.8 million in non-military aid.
   While forgoing military assistance to the rebels, President Bush
put the ball in the Sandinistas' court, saying that regime must
honestly comply with promises to encourage democracy and freedom.
   Last month, Nicaragua's foreign minister, Miguel D'Escoto,
accused the United States of spreading ``systematic lies'' to
discredit Nicaragua and its preparations for free elections in 1990.

<HEAD>Chrysler Signs Job-Commitment Agreement with NAACP</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. on Tuesday signed an agreement with
the NAACP to double the number of minorities and women in executive
management positions to 20 percent of its work force within five
years.
   Chrysler became the 62nd company and the last of the Big Three
automakers to join the NAACP ``fair share'' program, but NAACP
executive director Benjamin Hooks said Chrysler already was doing
many of the things the program calls for.
   ``The Big Three automobile companies have been the most
consistent supporters of the black community,'' said Hooks.
   The commitment was signed by Hooks and Chrysler chairman Lee
Iacoccca as part of the annual meeting here of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the nation's
oldest and largest civil rights organization.
   Generally, companies joining the fair share program make
commitments to expand access of blacks to entry- and mid-level jobs,
increase the number of black-owned suppliers and appoint blacks to
boards of directors.
   Anthony St. John, chief of the No. 3 automaker's personnel
operations, said the company hopes to maintain its 23 percent level
of minority hourly workers during the next five years.
   Earlier Tuesday, Mayor Coleman Young told delegates on the third
day of the conference that blacks who want to help the inner cities
should stop spending money with retailers that move to the suburbs.
   Stores have little reason to stay in the city ``when black people
in too large numbers too easily follow them ... begging them to take
their money,'' Young said. ``We have to learn to spend our money
with our own, and in our own city.''
   Such economic strategies are needed when the rights of women as
well as blacks and other minorities are newly threatened, Young said.
   ``We now face a situation where the Supreme Court is attempting
to reverse affirmative action,'' the mayor said. ``I think we need a
mighty coalition of protest in America.''
   Quoting Benjamin Franklin's statement at the signing of the
Declaration of Independence that ``we must all hang together, or
assuredly we shall all hang separately,'' Young added: ``The hangman
is out there, and the noose is ready. Welcome to Detroit, where the
struggle is a daily affair.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle is scheduled to address the convention
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Two Killed as Ethnic Violence Flares Anew in Nagorno-Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Azerbaijanis were ambushed Tuesday,
apparently by Armenians, and two were shot and killed as ethnic
rioting flared anew in the troubled southern region of
Nagorno-Karabakh, Tass said.
   In a separate incident, soldiers trying to clear roads around
Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh, were pelted by
stones and shot at with hunting rifles, and 19 suffered injuries,
Tass said.
   Nagorno-Karabakh is predominantly Armenian and Christian,
although it is located within the predominantly Moslem republic of
Azerbaijan.
   In the ambush near the village of Kirkidzhan, on the outskirts of
Stepanakert, two Azerbaijanis wer shot to death and a third was
seriously wounded, Tass said. Although Tass did not identify the
attackers, the ambush apparently was the work of Armenians.
   The report said tension was continuing to rise in the Caucasian
Mountain enclave, which for nearly two years has been the scene of
sharp conflict between the Armenian majority and Azerbaijanis.
   Interior Ministry troops and police were on alert in the region,
with troops patrolling in cars and helicopters, Tass said.
   On Monday, unidentified people had tried to block roads in the
region, and that ``clashes of large groups of population with the
use of firearms ... and bottles filled with incendiary liquid became
more frequent,'' Tass said.
   On Tuesday in Stepanakert, Armenians blockaded streets with iron
plates and telegraph poles, and in the village of Khodzhali,
Azerbaijanis built barricades of cars, it said.
   Interior Ministry soldiers trying to clear roads in the area
around Stepanakert were ``pelted by stones from the crowd and fired
upon with hunting rifles,'' and 19 were injured.
   Azerbaijanis near the regional administrative center of Askeran
stopped a police car and tried to seize the officers' weapons, the
news agency said. One of the officers was injured in the struggle
before another police detail restored order, it said.
   The strife in Nagorno-Karabakh began when the Armenian population
there and in neighboring republic of Armenia began protesting
because the largely Moslem republic of Azerbaijan administered the
enclave.
   Officials in Moscow sought to defuse the tension by creating a
commission to exercise administative control of Nagorno-Karabakh in
January, but the troubles have continued.
   A commission on Nagorno-Karabakh established by the new Congress
of People's Deputies will review seven proposed solutions for the
ethnic conflict, government officials have said.
   On May 9, authorities took further steps to curb the unrest by
lengthening the curfew there.

   Heavy rain set off landslides and flooded cities
in southwestern China, killing 221 people, destroying thousands of
homes and inundating crops, official reports said Tuesday.
   State TV showed riverside cliffs collapsing and floodwaters up to
the eaves of homes in Chongqing, 900 miles southwest of the capital.
   More than 13,450 houses were damaged by rainfall that totaled 16
inches in the hardest-hit areas in recent days, according to the
official Xinhua News Agency.
   Xinhua said 221 people died in Sichuan province, including 137 in
flooding around Chongqing on Sunday and Monday. At least 432 people
were injured and 10 others were missing.
   About 2.1 million acres of crops have been submerged, it said.
   State TV said the army had been called in to help in the rescue
operation along the Yangtze River, China's longest and largest
waterway, which runs through Chungking.
   Official reports also said hundreds of thousands of people were
reinforcing dikes along the lower reaches of the Yangtze, which has
risen above danger marks in many locations because of heavy rains
this month.
   More than 100 deaths from flooding have been reported in coastal
and southern areas of China since the start of July.

   The World Jewish Congress, which opened
its first office in a communist country this week, could open one in
the Soviet Union within two years, said the group's president said
Tuesday.
   Edgar M. Bronfman also said his talks with Hungarian leaders
convinced him they are committed to transforming the country into a
democracy.
   The new office opened Monday in the Hungarian capital, with a
staff of five, is designed to work with Hungary's 80,000 Jews and
with the small Jewish populations in other East European countries
outside the Soviet Union.
   ``My guess is that the WJC will have an office in the Soviet
Union within the next two years,'' Bronfman told reporters. ``We
would like to open up an office in the Soviet Union because there
are so many Jews there.''
   Bronfman said the Soviet Jews, estimated to number anywhere from
1.8 million to 3 million, would first have to become more organized
and join the World Jewish Congress to clear the way for the office
in Moscow.
   He also said that while an office had been ``agreed upon in
principle'' with the Kremlin, the timing still was not certain.
   ``The situation in the Soviet Union has improved enormously as
far as the Jewish population is concerned, both in terms of cultural
and religious freedom, and in terms of emigration,'' Bronfman said.
   After years of thwarting such emigration, the Soviet Union has
begun allowing thousands of Jews to leave each year.
   Bronfman met with various Hungarian leaders, including Premier
Miklos Nemeth and Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, during his
three-day visit to Budapest.
   ``It's clear that they want this country to become a democracy,''
Bronfman said, speaking just hours before the scheduled arrival of
President Bush.
   Bronfman continued: ``They are very anxious to have a lot of
capital investment. They don't expect any debt forgiveness.''
   Hungary, with a population of 10.5 million people, has a nearly
crushing foreign debt of $17 billion.
   Earlier Tuesday, Bronfman received a government award in
recognition of his efforts to promote Hungarian-American relations.
   The congress, based in New York, represents Jews in 70 countries
around the world.

   A suspected Palestinian terrorist won't be
extradited to the United States during the three-month duration of a
new conservative-communist coalition government, the justice
minister said Tuesday.
   Minister Fotis Kouvelis said the decision will be made by the
government emerging from elections in October.
   Mohammed Rashid, 39, is accused of planting a bomb on a Pan Am
jumbo jet in 1982. A Japanese teen-ager was killed and 15 other
people were wounded in the blast over Hawaii.
   Greece's Supreme Court on May 12 upheld an extradition order
sought by the United States. But the justice minister has final say
on all extraditions.
   U.S. officials have described the case as a test of Greece's
willingness to fight international terrorism.
   The former socialist administration had postponed the decision on
Rashid until after June 18 general elections.
   But after no party won a majority in the vote, the conservative
New Democracy party and communist-led Coalition of the Left and
Progress decided to govern together for three months.
   Kouvelis is one of two ministers appointed by the communists. The
other is Interior Minister Nikos Kostandopoulos, a lawyer who fought
Rashid's extradition case.
   Rashid, held since his arrest at Athens airport in May 1988, was
sentenced to eight months' jail on March 28 on charges of attempting
to escape after makeshift knives were found in his cell.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization claims Rashid is an officer
in its military branch called Mohammed Hamdan, 34. PLO officials
deny charges he is a terrorist and describe the extradition request
as a plot to discredit them.

<TEXT>
   Two Air Force policemen were charged with
stealing three F-16 engines and 12 other people were indicted in a
sting in which FBI agents ran a military surplus store dealing in
stolen property, authorities said Tuesday.
   Agents have identified up to 100 suspects, some military
policemen, at Hill Air Force Base, other Utah installations and 15
other communities in the West and Southwest, said Robert Bryant,
agent in charge of the FBI's Utah office.
   The indictments remained sealed in federal court and the names of
the people were not released.
   ``The thefts at Hill ... appear to be part of a larger problem
involving other states and other military establishments,'' said
U.S. Attorney Dee Benson.
   ``Unfortunately, many of the participants are military policemen,
and we find that especially disturbing.''
   Benson identified the two men arrested at a Bountiful restaurant
Monday night as Airman 1st Class Brian Roth of Chesterland, Ohio,
and Senior Airman Danny Joe Stroud of Newton, Kan. Their ages were
not released.
   Benson said he expected ``many more'' arrests in coming weeks.
   Operation Punchout, a joint effort of the FBI, the Department of
the Defense and the Air Force, began in 1986 when stolen military
goods became increasingly available in the Salt Lake Valley, Bryant
said.
   It targeted military and civilian personnel as well as
unscrupulous wholesalers of stolen goods, he said.
   The FBI established a storefront in Roy near the base called
Military Surplus Brokers, which spent about $80,000 to buy thousands
of items worth about $600,000 stolen from all branches of the
military, Bryant said.
   Benson said the stolen military equipment included sleeping bags,
helmets, canteens, munitions and firearms, as well as the jet
engines, although no military systems or strategic weapons were
involved.
   He said the purchases resulted in ``the identification of more
than 100 suspects throughout the United States who are involved in
the theft and sale of stolen government property.''
   He said Roth and Stroud had approached undercover officers with
an offer to sell the jet fighter engines. The two were given a down
payment of $10,000 toward a purchase price of $300,000 for the three
engines, valued at $2 million each, he said.
   The two men brought the engines to the FBI agents by trailer.
   Both were charged with theft of government property and
conspiracy. They were jailed without bail.
   The Pratt &amp; Whitney F100-PW-200 engines were reported missing
last Wednesday by maintenance personnel returning from the
Independence Day holiday.
   Bryant said between 25 percent and 30 percent of those believed
involved are active military personnel, but none of them was a
high-ranking officer.
   He said there was no evidence the suspects believed they were
selling the jet engines to a foreign power, nor that they were
linked to thefts at other bases.
   ``It was just good, old-fashioned greed,'' Bryant said.
   Wayne Hufnagel, commander of the office of special investigations
at Lowry Air Force Base in Colorado, said the operation was known to
several base commanders and that military equipment was permitted to
be taken off the installations in order not to compromise the

<HEAD>American Journalist to be Released By Weekend</HEAD>

   An American photographer captured more
than a month ago while traveling with Moslem guerrillas will be
released before the weekend, a government source said Tuesday.
   President Najib will issue a pardon for Tony O'Brien, who was
arrested June 8 for entering Afghanistan illegally, said the source,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The source said a consular officer from the U.S. Embassy in New
Delhi was to arrive in the Afghan capital to secure the release of
the free-lance photographer.
   ``All paperwork concerning the case has been completed and the
president will now issue an order pardoning the American,'' he said.
   A U.S. official in New Delhi said the embassy had been told the
Afghan government was not prepared to release O'Brien during the
three-day Islamic festival of sacrifice, Eid Al-Azha, which begins
Thursday.
   ``A consular officer is prepared to go but we have been told he
cannot be freed during the festival,'' said the official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Embassy in Kabul was closed in January, before the
Soviet Union completed its troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
   
   The Afghan government earlier said Najib agreed to release
O'Brien without trial following a personal appeal by Palestine
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat.
   O'Brien, who did not have a visa to enter the country, was
arrested by security forces at a rebel hideout in Kabul. He has not
been charged.
   The 43-year-old native of Santa Fe, N.M., has been covering the
war from the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar, where many of the
guerrillas are based.
   He was on assignment for Time-Life Inc. when he crossed into
Afghanistan.
   The guerrillas, backed by the United States, have been fighting
to overthrow the Soviet-backed government for 11 years.

   Soviet television on Tuesday broadcast a brief
report on the meeting between President Bush and Polish labor leader
Lech Walesa in the port of Gdansk, birthplace of Solidarity.
   Soviet media, which until recently had branded Walesa and his
independent Solidarity trade union as anti-socialist, now carry
neutral and in some cases positive reports about the moderate Polish
opposition.
   Reports have critized radical Solidarity groups that refused to
take part in parliamentary elections.
   The main Soviet evening television news program ``Vremya''
reported that Bush, ``on an official visit to Poland, arrived in
Gdansk and met with Lech Walesa, chairman of the Solidarity trade
union.''
   It also said Bush met with Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski and
showed footage of that meeting.
   Bush later flew to Hungary for a visit before attending an
international economic summit in Paris.

<HEAD>Foreign Aid Bill Bogged Down in Partisan Dispute</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee drafting a foreign aid
bill broke up in bitter partisan dispute Tuesday after its
Democratic chairman complained Republicans were not going along with
a compromise worked out with the Bush administration.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., had proposed a compromise to the $14.3
billion money bill for the fiscal year that begins this Oct. 1,
shifting $166 million into categories the administration wants _
primarily military aid to friendly countries.
   But as the meeting of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign
Operations panel began, Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., asked to be
allowed to offer an amendment that would cut development aid to
China through the International Development Association.
   Obey, seeing the move as an effort to score political points at
the expense of Democrats, reacted angrily: ``Unless we have
bipartisan agreement, we don't have any intention of supporting the
agreement worked out with the administration. It's just that
simple.''
   Ranking GOP subcommittee member Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, his
voice rising, said Obey was asking for too much. There would be no
``gag rule,'' he declared. ``You can play games all you want.''
   Responded Obey: ``If I buy this amendment, I want to know what it
gets us.'' Obey later adjourned the meeting indefinitely and told
reporters he was tired of taking the heat for pushing an unpopular
bill which the White House wants far more than does Congress.
   The bill in dispute appropriates money for the full range of U.S.
foreign aid programs for the coming year, from subsidies for
military equipment purchases to aid for health and development in
the Third World.
   At the same time, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee failed
for the fifth time to muster a quorum needed to take action on its
own foreign aid bill, which would set the policies under which the
aid money would be spent.
   Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., said he would try
again Wednesday to get enough senators together so the measure could
be sent to the full Senate.

<HEAD>Students Freed from Soviet Military Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature voted Tuesday to allow students
drafted into the Red Army to be discharged before they complete
their two-year service, Tass reported.
   The move was seen as another step to scale back the Soviet
military.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov proposed the measure, and it was met
by ``a storm of applause, unprecedented in the new Soviet
parliament,'' the official news agency said.
   The Supreme Soviet decreed that 175,000 students will be relieved
of military service in the next two months.
   The step had been suggested by legislators speaking to the
Supreme Soviet's parent body, the Congress of People's Deputies,
which met May 25 to June 9.
   It was an expansion on plans Tass announced April 11 for students
to serve only one year in the military instead of 18 months in the
army and air force or two years in the navy.
   The Defense Ministry had announced in March that students could
defer military service until after graduation.
   Previously, all Soviet men between the ages of 18 and 25 were
eligible for the draft and there were no exemptions for students.
   Tass did not give a vote for the Supreme Soviet's approval of the
discharge. It was the first lawmaking action the new body has taken
since it went into session June 10. The Supreme Soviet had been
focusing on reviewing the candidates Ryzhkov nominated for his
Cabinet.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has taken several steps since
coming to power in 1985 to decrease military spending and reduce the
Soviet arsenal. In December, he announced that Soviet troops would
be cut by 500,000 and military spending would be reduced by 14
percent.
   Gorbachev's reductions would cut the Soviet armed forces to
3,760,000. The United States has about 2.13 million men and women in
active duty.

<HEAD>House Urges Bush to Pressure Banks on Mexico Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Tuesday urged President Bush to
pressure private U.S. and foreign banks to negotiate larger debt
forgiveness agreements with Mexico.
   The action, on a 331-77 vote, was a reaffirmation of a plan
introduced earlier this year by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   The reduction should be big enough to allow Mexico ``to achieve a
sufficiently positive rate of economic growth to ensure the
maintenance of social and economic stability,'' according to the
non-binding resolution.
   The House action also urged U.S. banking regulators _ the Federal
Reserve Board and the Comptroller of the Currency _ to make banks
set aside more reserves for covering impaired foreign debt.
   Mexico and its 15 main creditor private banks said over the
weekend that they are close to reaching an agreement in principle on
a package that could reduce Mexico's debt service costs by $3
billion a year.
   Mexico asked for a 55 percent reduction in the $54 billion it
owes private lenders, about $15 billion of it to U.S. banks, after
Brady unveiled his Third World debt relief plan in March.
   The banks, led by Citicorp, Manufacturers Hanover and Chemical
Bank in New York and Bank of America in San Francisco, have offered
a 35 percent reduction if the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund guarantee interest payments on the remaining balance.
   Brady's plan offers private banks government-backed guarantees
they will be paid interest on the remaining balance if they
voluntarily reduce the debt Third World countries owe them.
   ``The Mexican deal is going to be the model for implementation of
the Brady plan,'' said Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y.
   However, opponents complained that the guarantees will perpetuate
a taxpayer bailout of poor lending decisions made by the private
banks.
   ``In the end, the U.S. taxpayer is going to be left holding the
bag,'' said Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis.

<HEAD>Cubans Defend Death Sentences of Convicted Of Drug Smugglers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cuban leaders apparently are standing firm in
their decision to send a war hero and three other former army
officers to the firing squad for drug trafficking despite
international pleas for clemency.
   ``Cuba's traditional enemies would also criticize us if we don't
shoot them, saying we don't make an example of those involved in
international drug trade,'' said Carlos Rafael Rodriguez, vice
president of the Council of State.
   The official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina, which carried his
comments, also said the Cuban masses support Sunday's vote by
President Fidel Castro and the 28 other members of the council to
uphold the death penalty for former Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa.
   ``It was very painful, but it is a very traitorous crime that
must be punished with the maximum penalty,'' the news agency quoted
Vilma Espin, president of the Federation of Cuban Women, as saying.
   The news agency has not yet said when the sentences would be
carried out or whether Castro, who for years angrily denied U.S.
charges that Cuba was a way station for drugs, could grant a
reprieve.
   Pope John Paul II asked Cuban authorities for clemency for Ochoa
and the three others, the Vatican said Tuesday.
   Ochoa, Col. Antonio de la Guardia, Maj. Armando Padron and Capt.
Jorge Martinez were convicted by a court-martial last week of
helping smuggle tons of cocaine and shiploads of marijuana into the
United States.
   Ten other officers were convicted in the case, which also
involved smuggling of diamonds, ivory and dollars, and sentenced to
terms ranging from 10 to 30 years in prison.
   Defense Minister Raul Castro called drugs a capitalist plague and
said Cuba must purge itself of ``corrosive conduct.''
   It be would better ``for our beloved and beautiful island to sink
into the sea like the legendary Atlantis rather than succumb again
to capitalism's corruptions,'' the president's brother said.
   Failing to apply the maximum punishment to Ochoa and his
collaborators would be setting ``an ominous precedent of impunity,''
he said.
   The arrests and trial constituted the biggest scandal to hit Cuba
since Fidel Castro came to power Jan. 1, 1959.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States is ``still assessing the dramatic developments
that have taken place in Cuba over the last three weeks'' involving
the drug scandal.
   ``If the Cuban government is indeed serious about efforts to
combat narcotics, we welcome its contribution. If, on the other
hand, traffic continues unimpeded in the wake of the trial of Ochoa
and others, then we would question the Cuban government's commitment
to the anti-drug struggle.''
   ``We're adopting a wait-and-see attitude to see if the Cuban
government's deeds match its words,'' he said.
   Raul Castro said he had given Ochoa broad powers as commander of
Cuban troops in Angola in 1987 and 1988 and recalled how Ochoa had
invoked those powers to sentence three Cuban soldiers to death for
murdering some Angolans.
   Ochoa, 57, fought alongside the Castro brothers in Cuba's rugged
mountains during the revolution that overthrew dictator Fulgencio
Batista. He went on to become a trusted aide who carried out
confidential missions for the president.
   He was named a Hero of the Republic, one of only five Cuban
officers ever so honored, for his field service in Angola and
Ethiopia.
   All 14 defendants in the case were officers of the Cuban armed
forces or held high positions in the security staff of the Interior
Ministry. They were stripped of all rank and decorations last month
and dishonorably discharged.

   Oliver North said today he is appealing his
conviction and sentence in the Iran-Contra affair, following a
judge's decision last week that North woldn't be sent to prison.
   After today's appeal, U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
issued an order saying North won't have to pay $150,000 in fines
until the matter is resolved.
   North disclosed his intentions in a one-sentence notice:
   ``Oliver L. North appeals to the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia from the judgment of conviction and
sentence entered by ... Gesell ... on July 5,'' said the notice.
   Last Wednesday, Gesell fined North $150,000, placed him on two
years probation and ordered him to perform 1,200 hours of community
service. North was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting in
obstruction of Congress, of destroying documents and of accepting an
illegal gratuity in connection with the Iran-Contra affair.
   In a separate court filing, North said he wants to begin the
community service portion of his sentence immediately.
   ``We understand that the next six to 12 months is a critical
`start up' period during which the program could best use the
assistance'' of North, his lawyers said in the filing.
   He was sentenced to work with a Washington program that is
involved with training, educating and providing after-care for inner
city youth living in public housing where they are constantly
exposed to drugs.
   Gesell said he decided not to send North to prison because it
would only ``harden your misconceptions'' about public service and
increase the former White House aide's feelings of martyrdom.
   Prosecutors said in a one-sentence response to North's notice
that they wouldn't oppose delaying his fine or probation conditioned
on community service while the appeal is being considered.

   More than 50,000 people gave President Bush
a hero's welcome Tuesday at the worker's monument where Solidarity
was born in a wave of labor upheaval. ``America stands with you,''
Bush said.
   They chanted ``Stay with us'' and ``Long live Bush!'' during an
emotional rally just outside the Lenin Shipyard, after Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa asked Bush to amplify a $115 million U.S. aid
plan with his support for a $10 billion private-investment rescue
package.
   About 25,000 people were packed in around the monument while at
least an equal number lined the 2.5 miles of streets as Bush's
motorcade drove from a lunch at the home of Walesa to the yard.
   An interpreter for Mrs. Bush quoted Walesa as telling the crowd:
``There have been many demonstrations in this place, and I have
never in my whole life seen anything like this.''
   Bush paid homage to Polish workers who have struggled since 1970
for freedom and a better life, contributing to the dramatic
democratic reforms now taking place in the country.
   Walesa hosted a homestyle private lunch for the president and
raised the possibility of even more aid to Poland by Western nations
than the $115 million announced by Bush on Monday.
   Solidarity argues that the help is needed to ensure that public
unrest does not upset the delicate progress toward democracy. But it
agrees any aid should have tight controls on it, so it is not wasted
as it was in the past.
   After Bush's departure for Budapest, Walesa's spokesman issued a
statement quoting Walesa as saying the six points the president
presented in parliament were ``an important idea,'' but adding:
   ``We hope that these will not be the only sums and projects. We
especially count on this after the Paris summit,'' referring to the
economic summit of seven industrial nations that begins Friday.
   In his speech at the workers monument outside the shipyard _
three soaring steel-plated crosses topped by anchors _ Bush invoked
the spirit of President John F. Kennedy's 1963 speech at the Berlin
Wall.
   ``To those who think that freedom can be forever denied, I say:
let them look at Poland,'' Bush said.
   ``To those who think that dreams can be forever repressed, I say:
let them look at Poland. ...
   ``Today the brave workers of Gdansk stand beside this monument as
a beacon of hope, a symbol of that dream. And the brave workers of
Gdansk know Poland is not alone. America stands with you.''
   The phrase brought a roar of applause and renewed chants of
``Long live Bush.''
   The president repeated throughout the visit that the United
States was willing to help Poland but that Poles themselves must
accept further sacrifice.
   Bush sought to inspire his listeners, telling them that Poles who
came to American built a better life in one generation and they
could do the same too, this time at home in Poland.
   If he was a young Pole, he added, he would remain at home and not
emigrate.
   ``Stay with us, stay with us,'' the crowd chanted back to Bush
amid laughter.
   Before taking leave of the workers, Bush and Walesa together
faced the monument and raised their arms in a ``v'' for victory, a
sign used by Solidarity.
   The president rounded out his visit to Poland with one last
meeting and farewell from Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   ``We have sown new seeds,'' Jaruzelski told Bush. ``I am
convinced ... this visit will contribute to the development of
comprehensive bilateral cooperation.''
   An official commentary issued by the PAP news agency declared the
visit ``a success of both sides'' sealing the return of normal
U.S.-Polish relations after the breakdown of the martial-law years
in the early 1980s.

   About 4,000 evangelical Christians
opened a conference Tuesday to forge new strategies for spreading
the faith in a rapidly changing world.
   The goal is to preach to everyone in the world by the end of this
century and try to take advantage of political changes such as
liberalization in the Soviet Union and the growth of the faith in
developing countries.
   Delegates to the 10-day convention, dubbed ``Lausanne II'' after
a similar gathering in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1974, represented
191 countries, making it one of the largest gatherings of its kind,
organizers said.
   In a keynote address, the Rev. Leighton Ford, chairman of the
Lausanne committee that is sponsoring the conference, said the
evangelical movement was facing new opportunities.
   ``Now, we wait expectantly to see what the new openness and
longing for freedom in our world _ as shown in the spirit of
`glasnost' and the events in China _ will mean for the future of the
gospel,'' said Ford, a Canadian.
   Ford said he welcomed delegates from the Soviet Union, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, East Germany, Romania, Cuba, Mozambique and
other communist countries to the convention.
   But another official said the Soviet delegation had not arrived
and that the list of those who are in Manila has not been finalized.
   Ford also noted an increase in interest in evangelism among major
Christian denominations.
   ``Now, we do not hear the word `moratorium' and many of these
same historic churches are re-thinking the need for agressive
missionary outreach and some have called for the '90s to be a decade
of evangelism,'' said Ford, a brother-in-law of the American
evangelist, the Rev. Billy Graham.
   Graham was set to speak at the Manila conference but commitments
in London prevented him from coming, organizers said.
   Ford said that by the year 2000, world evangelicals should be
able to reach 2.5 billion people who have not heard the gospel.
   He also cited the increase in the number of missionaries from
developing countries and the need to face economic and social issues
in spreading the faith.
   ``Then, our world was not quite so clearly aware of the
`troubles' in Northern Ireland or of apartheid in South Africa,
where the gospel has been wrapped in the sectarian robes of race and
power,'' Ford said. ``Now, we are aware and we stand with our
brothers and sisters in those areas where they seek to faithfully
live and speak for Chirst.''
   He told the delegates they must find ways to make the faith
attractive to people in widely differing parts of the world.
   ``Indians see Christ's peace in a way that Englishmen don't.
Brazilians see it in a way that Nigerians don't. Pacific Islanders
see it in a way that Germans don't,'' Ford said. ``But as we focus
on these next 10 days on Christ, we may learn to procalim his peace
as He did.''
   Earlier, Thomas Wang, Lausanne II international director, said
continued suffering has helped in the steady growth of Christian
churches in China since the world's most populous country fell under
Communist rule in 1949.
   ``Suffering is one of the important reasons for churches to
grow,'' said Wang, and American. ``I believe that has been the main
reason for the Chinese churches to grow from 800,000 members in 1949
to 50 million today.''
   China forced a halt to religious activity during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution, but since has allowed churches to reopen.
   Wang said some 300 Chinese church representatives had been
expected to attend the Manila conference, but China's crackdown on
the democracy movement has made it virtually impossible for Chinese
to obtain exit visas.
   Wang said he expected seven Chinese church leaders who already
were outside China when the crackdown began to attend.

   The thunderstorm that soaked crowds
waiting to see President Bush left some Hungarians with no glimpse
of him at all _ including a military honor guard that had stood at
attention through a driving rain but was bypassed by the
presidential entourage.
   ``Nobody told us a damned thing,'' fumed a militarty officer, who
asked not to be named.
   For at least 10 minutes of driving rain, the guard had waited in
front of a red-carpeted reviewing stand for Bush to review the
troops after speaking in Lajos Kossuth Square.
   But Bush discarded his planned speech, spoke briefly to thank the
thousands of Hungarians for braving the hurricane-like winds that
preceded his arrival and then was whisked to his limousine for a
ride of a few hundred yards to a side entrance of the nearby
parliament building for a state dinner.
   Others who had braved the rains shared the honor guard's
frustration as Bush abandoned the second half of the planned
welcoming ceremonies.
   Indeed, thousands of wellwishers had positioned themselves for
the military review, the playing of the U.S. and Hungarian anthems
and the formal presentation of flowers.
   After Bush's limousine whisked by, many in the crowd rushed to
the front entrance of parliament in a futile effort to catch a
glimpse of the president, who was already inside.
   Hungarian military officials scurried around trying to find out
whether the program had been changed and, finally, one agitated
officer ordered the honor guard to march away.
   Despite the abrupt change in plans, Hungarians were still
delighted that Bush had come.
   ``It was well worth waiting in the rain,'' said Agnes Varnai, a
young Budapest advertising worker. ``This was a good thing, it will
take a few days for it to sink in.''

   There are karate shoes and volleyball shoes,
skateboarding shoes and cheerleading shoes. Now, syringes washing
onto beaches are boosting sales of the latest entry in the athletic
footwear market: the water shoe.
   The $25-to-$60 ankle-high, mesh and rubber booties are light
enough for swimming but have tough soles to protect against hot
sand, barnacles, shells, coral ... or the occasional jagged test
tube encrusted with blood.
   Despite their price _ two to six times the cost of ordinary
flip-flops _ the shoes are reported by retailers and mail-order
houses to be selling fast, especially in Florida, Texas, Southern
California and New England.
   ``They've caught on really fast,'' said Kristi Pike, a floor
supervisor for Eastern Mountain Sports in Boston. ``People see other
people wearing them on the beach and come in to ask for them.''
   Nike originally developed its Aqua Sock as a super-light running
shoe. But what bombed among runners scored an immediate hit among
windsurfers when it re-emerged two years ago in a modified shape and
neon colors.
   ``We really thought there was going to be a narrow market for
it,'' said Liz G. Dolan, a spokeswoman for the Beaverton, Ore.,
company. ``Now we're in a situation where we really cannot make them
fast enough.''
   Plenty of industry analysts believe the water shoe could outrun
the football shoe, which is projected to generate $50 million in
sales this year, and perhaps climb as high as the hiking boot, with
$116 million in sales.
   So far, the main entrants in the water shoe market are
Stoughton-based Reebok International Ltd., Nike and Omega Corp., a
privately-held boat shoe manufacturer in Boston.
   Citing the intense competition, all three companies declined to

   After the water shoe, what's next?
   ``I don't know,'' said Stephen Encarnacao, head of marketing and

<HEAD>New FAA Administrator Plants Flag, Takes Oath</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Adm. James B. Busey IV planted a bright
orange flag on a Federal Aviation Administration stage Tuesday and
took the oath as administrator of the 50,000-employee agency.
   ``You've got to plant your own flag now. In the Navy, you used to
have people do it for you,'' Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner
told Busey before swearing him in on a stage decorated with the
bright FAA banner.
   Skinner said Busey was taking on a harder job than his own. The
former commander of U.S. Navy forces in Europe succeeds Allan
McArtor, who resigned as FAA administrator in February.
   The FAA oversees nonmilitary aviation and includes air traffic
control operations that monitor and guide aircraft through U.S.
skies. It also is responsible for the safety of all types of
aircraft.
   Among challenges Busey faces are the need to modernize and expand
the air traffic control system, protect the safety of the nation's
aging airliner fleet and meet what he said is the threat of
``state-sponsored terrorism.''
   Skinner, who has kept a high profile on aviation issues during
the four months the agency was without a permanent head, said he did
not know Busey before beginning the process of searching for a new
administrator. But he said he was convinced Busey is the
most-qualified man for the job.
   Congress had to pass special legislation to allow Busey to serve
at the top of the civilian agency while retaining his Navy
retirement status. The law creating the FAA says its administrator
must be a civilian, although similar legislated exceptions have been
made in the past.
   The admiral received no opposition during confirmation hearings.
   Busey, who rose from an enlisted man to four-star admiral during
37 years of Navy service, has no civilian aviation experience. He is
a pilot, however, and had been commander of the naval air systems
command.
   Busey, in brief remarks, gave no indication of policies he would
pursue but said he would work to keep the skies safe and planned to
travel extensively to FAA facilities ``where the rubber meets the
road.''
   The swearing-in ceremonies, broadcast by satellite to 33 FAA
facilities, featured an original song by an FAA choral group, a
prayer by a minister and the singing of an expanded version of The
Star Spangled Banner by a soprano. Both the minister, Harold Pratt,
and the singer, Sandra Buchanan, are also FAA employees.

   The District of Columbia Council on Tuesday
canceled a vote on legislation aimed at holding handgun
manufacturers financially liable for injuries and deaths caused in
shootings.
   The bill, apparently the first of its kind in the nation, had
faced an unfriendly reception in Congress, which has the power to
review and reject any law passed by the council.
   Councilmember Wilhelmina Rolark said she was withdrawing the bill
because court cases in which plaintiffs are suing handgun
manufacturers have not yet been resolved.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., a frequent critic of the district
government, had threatened to block the legislation. He likened the
bill to an attempt ``to hold Black and Decker responsible for `The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre.'''
   Del. Walter Fauntroy, D-D.C., told the council in a letter
delivered on Monday that the bill was likely to be rejected by the
House.
   ``There were simply not the votes to support the bill,'' said
councilmember Charlene Drew-Jarvis. ``It could cause problems ... on
the Hill.''
   ``The council's action shows enlightened foresight,'' Parris said
in a statement released after the bill was pulled back.
   Richard Gardner, state and local affairs director of the National
Rifle Association, had contended the bill was unconstitutional. He
said it would limit interstate commerce, a regulatory right reserved
for the federal government.
   The bill, given preliminary approval by an 8-4 vote two weeks
ago, was created in an attempt to stem a drug-related wave of
murders and other violent crime.
   Through Tuesday, 229 persons had been killed in Washington in
1989, compared with 159 by the same time last year. In 1988, a
record 372 persons were killed.

   Garfield Park is surrounded by some of the city's
meanest streets, and sending four unofficial rangers to patrol the
gang-infested area on expensive bicycles is what some are calling a
tragedy waiting to happen.
   ``There's less crime in the park than in the neighborhoods around
it _ that's the good news,'' said police Sgt. John Rooney, a member
of the violent crimes unit. ``The bad news is that I wouldn't advise
anybody _ ranger or not _ to ride through Garfield Park on a $700
bicycle. The idea doesn't exactly strike me as a brainstorm.''
   The Rangers in the Parks program, as conceived by city parks
officials, was to be a network of hundreds of volunteers and
off-duty police officers on horseback and all-terrain vehicles
crisscrossing the city's parks _ goodwill ambassadors backed by
police powers and a $90,000 budget.
   What it became after budget cuts was a $12,000 pilot program in
Garfield Park.
   ``We first envisioned this with rangers in 12 parks, guides for
tourists in the lakefront parks ... promoting our programs and
teaching appreciation for the history and beauty of the parks _ at
one point, even an eyes-and-ears-of-the-police kind of thing,'' said
Jim Albritton, the Park District supervisor in charge of the program.
   The first element cut from the Rangers program was any kind of
law-enforcement role.
   Though they carry two-way radios and are in touch with Park
District supervisors _ who in turn can call police _ the rangers
will have ``very limited roles as peacekeepers,'' Albritton said.
   ``The idea is build goodwill in the park, not break up fights. To
make friends with the kids, report equipment that needs fixing,
nudge people to clean up after themselves, keep an eye peeled for
emergencies.
   ``But whether they should call in if they see a drug buy, for
instance, that's a very touchy question,'' Albritton said. ``We're
still working on those questions.''
   Rooney said Park District officials had better come up with the
answers quickly.
   ``There are a few gangs and lots of dope being sold in some parts
of the park,'' he said. ``There's potential for trouble if they get
mixed up in that.''
   Freda Collins, a former speech pathologist and construction
worker who is the lone woman on the crew, said she believes her job
is to be visible, ``to encourage people to bring their kids and
their picnic baskets back to the park.''
   Each ranger receives an 18-speed trail bike, a uniform and three
days of training. They work eight hours each day from June until
early September, earning $6 an hour.
   Collins' colleagues are fourth-grade teacher Isaac Battle, former
military policeman Donnell Daniel and former marketing executive
Randis Clark.
   ``We're not so much worried about the danger, we all live in the
area and know what goes down,'' she said. ``That's what the police
are for.''

<TEXT>
   The Air Force, hoping to stem congressional
opposition to the B-2 bomber, said Tuesday that the radar-evading
aircraft outpaces 20 years of improvements in the Soviet air defense
and is key to the United States' strategic force.
   ``The estimate is the Soviets have invested the equivalent of
over $350 billion n those defenses over the 20-year period ... and
that investment continues,'' the Air Force said in an 18-page report
released by the ranking members of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
   ``That very expensive array of defenses is largely ineffective
against an aircraft with B-2 capabilities,'' the report said.
   In a closed session, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice and Air
Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch briefed members of the Senate Armed
Services Committee on the B-2, detailing the aircraft's importance
to the strategic forces, its conventional capability and its role if
a START agreement is reached with the Soviet Union.
   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, and John Warner of
Virginia, ranking Republican, released the report.
   ``We asked the Air Force to address the key issues of cost,
flight testing and the comparable worth of the B-2 as the Congress
debates the defense program,'' Nunn and Warner said in a one-page
statement accompanying the report.
   Opposition in Congress is based on the bomber's pricetag,
estimated at between $500 million and $750 million a copy, and the
delay in its first flight.
   The bomber moved under its own power Monday when it taxied along
a Mojave Desert runway. It is scheduled to make its maiden flight in
the next few weeks, 18 months behind schedule.
   ``I have serious concerns about the aircraft,'' said Senate Armed
Services member John McCain, R-Ariz., who attended the Air Force
briefing. The service ``must prove this aircraft before full-scale
production.''
   Another member of the Senate panel, Democrat John Glenn of Ohio,
last month urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to push back
procurement of the aircraft, questioning the wisdom of ``buy before
you fly.''
   In another step, the House Armed Services Committee slashed about
$500 million from the aircraft's procurement budget in fiscal 1990.
The Pentagon has proposed spending a total of about $4.7 billion for
the bomber.
   One day after the runway test, the Air Force presented its
argument to the Senate Armed Services panel, which is in the midst
of voting on the fiscal 1990 defense budget.
   ``The B-2 can fly through virtually unchallenged by air defense
weapons and has the resilience to cope with the longer term
improvements in air defenses the Soviets may choose to make,'' the
service said.
   The Air Force also argued that the bomber ``can make a powerful
contribution with its conventional capability.'' Specifically, the
B-2 can cover all the world's land areas from three locations _
Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean and Guam in the Pacific _ with a single air refueling.
   The Air Force said the B-2 program is both ``affordable and
essential,'' consuming a smaller portion of the total military
budget than either of the last two large bomber programs.

   An investigating board, in a report released
Tuesday, said a broken metal band caused the $3.2 million mishap
that damaged NASA's newest wind tunnel at the Langley Research
Center in Virginia last January.
   NASA said the wind tunnel, which is capable of testing models of
advanced aircraft and spacecraft in the 600 mph to 900 mph range,
has been idled since the Jan. 18 accident. It is being rebuilt and
will be available for the resumption of research in November.
   The metal band, four feet in diameter and two feet long, holds
insulation on a fan drive shaft in the tunnel. The drive shaft was
turning at the rate of 580 rpm when the retainer broke and clamps
were flung outward, damaging all 25 fan blades.
   The National Transonic Facility, completed in 1983, is a new kind
of wind tunnel capable of simulating aerodynamic flight conditions
just below and above the speed of sound.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, predicting he
can save taxpayers $30 billion by fiscal year 1993, outlined a
complex plan Tuesday to overhaul the Pentagon's bureaucracy and
tighten control over its massive arms-purchasing systems.
   His proposals include paring the number of people involved in
purchasing decisions by thousands and giving more authority to the
undersecretary of defense in that area, thereby trimming some powers
of the individual military services.
   Cheney was quick to say he had no magic solution for ridding the
Pentagon and the defense establishment of fraud and abuse, or making
it more efficient. Nor will he be able to make his program work on
his own, he said.
   ``There's no silver bullet here. ... We have a blueprint that we
plan to pursue ... to try to significantly improve the way we do
business,'' Cheney said of his plan said at a Pentagon press
conference.
   ``If we're going to be successful, it will be because we got
Congress to cooperate,'' he said.
   His report was requested by President Bush five months ago as
part of a major review spurred by the weapons-procurement scandals
that rocked the defense establishment.
   Weapons purchases account for more than $60 billion of this
year's $305 billion military budget and involve more than a
half-million civilian and uniformed employees of the Defense
Department.
   Cheney acted Tuesday to put some of the changes in place, in
particular the realignment of his top-level Pentagon management
team. Other steps require congressional approval, while others will
need work ``throughout my tenure at the department,'' the secretary
said.
   Even before its official release, the package stirred opposition
on Capitol Hill, where some said it doesn't go into enough detail.
   However, one Democratic member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, said Tuesday that Cheney's
report is a ``good start toward acquisition reform, and I look
forward to working with him on his legislative proposals.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., also a member of the Armed Services
panel, said the present system is ``absolutely inefficient,
sometimes worse,'' and Cheney's proposal deserves strong support.
   Cheney also seeks relief from some congressional oversight
requests, complaining that Congress requires a ``staggering'' amount
of reports, inquiries and testimony from the military.
   To emphasize that point, Cheney and his deputy Donald Atwood
stood beside two five-foot high stacks of reports that Congress had
requested from the Pentagon during the past year. One of the reports
cost $1.9 million to produce, the secretary said.
   ``I'm convinced nobody ever reads these reports,'' Cheney
quipped, evoking laughter from his audience. ``It's make-work.''
Before taking the top Pentagon job this year, Cheney was a
Republican leader in the House.
   Cheney also is suggesting that Congress implement fully a
two-year defense budget process and establish select committees in
both houses to review and rewrite the maze of federal procurement
laws.
   Asked how many jobs would be cut due to the paring down of the
system, neither Cheney nor Atwood provided a specific answer.
   Cheney said that while more than 580,000 military and civilians
are involved in the acquisition process, much work is being done
because of the oversight requirements imposed by Congress and
savings ``will depend a lot upon the kind of support and cooperation
we get on Capitol Hill.''
   Queried about possible resistance to the reforms on the part of
the military officers who may lose some clout over weapons programs,
Cheney said that he'd taken care to bring the military service heads
into planning his report, and that he believed ``most people in the
department will in fact support it.''
   Many of the ideas included in the reform package were first
proposed in the 1986 Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management,
also known as the Packard Commission.
   The secretary's goal is to eliminate some layers in the
military's top management and establish ``a clear chain of command''
in the arms procurement process, said one Defense Department
official familiar with Cheney's thinking.
   The proposals include:
   _Establishing an executive panel to make all the major decisions
for the department.
   The board would be composed of the secretary, the deputy
secretary, undersecretary, the deputies for procurement and
acquisitions, the heads of the various services and the chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff.
   The panel would be smaller than the current Defense Resources
Board, which advises Cheney on major weapons and budgetary decisions.
   _Allowing the deputy secretary of defense to oversee the
Pentagon's system for planning, programming and devising its budget.
   He would oversee the Defense Planning and Resources Board, which
also will be asked to come up with a 20-year ``road map'' on the
long-term needs and investment plans for the department.
   _Enhancing the powers of the undersecretary of defense for
acquisition _ dubbed the ``acquisition czar.'' The undersecretary
would have ``full authority for major acquisition programs,'' which
would trim some of the services' powers.
   _Paring down and consolidating overlapping structures in the
acquisition system, eliminating ``layers and functions that have no
value.''
   The report notes that some 580,000 civilian and military
personnel around the world are involved in the procurement process.
The report suggests trimming the organizations on a phased basis
``by at least 15 percent'' by 1993.
   _Establishing a Defense Contract Management Agency to consolidate
contract administration activities and ride herd on the contracts
after they have been awarded.

   Hundreds of nurses demanding higher pay to
ease a nursing shortage went on strike at northern California's
biggest pediatric hospital Tuesday, forcing the transfer of nearly
100 critically ill youngsters.
   ``We're special people with special skills and we need special
pay,'' said a 34-year-old registered nurse, who identified herself
only as Jean.
   She joined the line outside Children's Hospital when the night
shift ended and the strike began at 7 a.m. Some 200 nurses picketed.
   A line of ambulances began moving the young patients, some of
northern California and northern Nevada's most critically ill
children, shortly after midnight, an operation officials didn't
expect to end until Wednesday.
   Doctors and management took up some nursing duties, said hospital
spokesman Steve Tiger.
   Patients were sent mostly to other San Francisco Bay area
hospitals, but Tiger said many might go to hospitals as far away as
Los Angeles and Seattle.
   The strike came after the California Nurses Association,
representing 700 nurses at Children's, rejected a wage offer of 18
percent over two years by a 4-1 margin Monday night. The nurses'
previous contract expired June 30.
   The nurses are demanding a two-year, 26 percent raise.
   ``If we don't do enough to attract people, we won't have the best
and the brightest nurses around for these children,'' said intensive
care nurse Karen Cooper.
   She called the strike ``a painful step'' to avert an even worse
labor crunch in the 1990s. A nursing shortage has hobbled hospital
throughout the country.
   No new talks were scheduled. Hospital administrator Tony Paap
said the hospital will not improve its offer, and he predicted a
long strike.
   ``We feel like the nursing union is disrupting the children's
care in the misguided hope of ending a nationwide nursing
shortage,'' said Tiger.
   Tiger denied there were ``real staffing shortages at this
hospital.'' At 6 percent, Children's has the lowest vacancy rate
among nurses in California, he said.
   Approximately 90 of about 140 patients were to be transferred and
about 10 others were to be discharged, leaving only some of the most
severely ill.
   Many of the youngsters at the hospital, which is one of only 14
in the nation with a pediatric trauma center, are premature, have
lung or heart ailments or are burn patients, said nursing supervisor
Dorothy Holmes.
   The hospital postponed elective surgery and stopped admitting
patients from the emergency room. Walk-in emergency care will be
offered, and general admissions will be done on a case-by-case
basis, Tiger said.
   Children's nurses now make between $32,000 and $39,000, which has
made them among the highest paid in the nation. But because of
recent wage increases at other facilities, CNA officials fear nurses
will leave Children's.
   The union is seeking salaries that would range between $39,400
and $49,100.

   The Pentagon informed Congress on Tuesday the
administration intends to sell Pakistan 60 F-16s fighter aircrafts
and support equipment at an estimated cost of $1.5 billion.
   ``This sale will contribute to the foreign policy and national
security of the United States by helping to improve the security of
a friendly country, which has been and continues to be an important
force for regional stability in South Asia,'' the Pentagon said in a
statment.
   Last month, Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan won a
commitment for the sophisticated fighters during a visit to
Washington.
   In its statement, the Pentagon said Pakistan needs the warplanes
to replace older aircraft and to maintain its territorial defenses.
   ``The sale of the aircraft ... will not alter the basic military
balance in the region,'' the statement said.
   The sale will not require the assignment of any additional U.S.
government or contractor personnel to Pakistan, it added.
   In an address before Congress last month, Prime Minister Bhutto
promised not to provoke a regional arms race by producing nuclear
weapons.
   She also urged the United States to work aggressively for a
broad-based political settlement in Afghanistan and said that
Pakistan's fledgling democracy deserved continued U.S. military and
economic assistance.

   A Justice Department official said Tuesday that
a Senate proposal to ``enhance'' Puerto Rico's commonwealth status
``would render the island virtually independent of U.S. authority in
many areas.''
   ``The governor of Puerto Rico would be granted an unprecedented
and truly extraordinary power to certify that a federal law or a
federal regulation is inapplicable to Puerto Rico,'' Edward S.G.
Dennis told a hearing of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee.
   Dennis, acting deputy attorney general, said the proposal for the
enhancement of commonwealth ``also would grant Puerto Rico much
greater advantages than any other area under U.S. sovereignty that
is not a state.''
   ``So long as Puerto Rico remains under the sovereignty of the
United States, it is essential that this fact be made clear. ...,''
Dennis told the committee.
   He advised the committee to make clear that any ``autonomy''
provided the commonwealth be ``limited to internal affairs.''
   ``Congress retains the authority to legislate with respect to
Puerto Rico,'' he added. ``Federal law may not be pre-empted or
nullified by the local government.''
   Dennis told the committee the proposal for statehood is ``the
least problematic'' and said most people understand what statehood
means. But he advised the committee to make sure that any vote for
independence would be a vote for ``full independence.''
   Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the committee, told
the administration spokesman he believes the commonwealth should
have as much autonomy as is possible, and also urged full
citizenship be allowed for the first generation should the voters of
Puerto Rico choose independence in a plebiscite scheduled for 1991.
   Johnston said he said he would favor the right of those Puerto
Ricans wishing to retain U.S. citizenship to do so but does not
believe it should extend to their children.
   During the morning session in a three-day round of hearings on
Puerto Rico's status, the chairman needled Bush for declaring his
personal preference for statehood and expressed hopes the
administration would be ``evenhanded'' in its treatment of the
upcoming plebiscite.

   Jerry Garcia, Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, members of the band that
has attracted devotion from fans for about two decades, said they
hoped to focus public awareness on the drive to stop destruction of
the rain forests.
   While the three said they were eager to promote the cause among
their fans, Garcia seemed to enjoy sparring with Rep. Claudine
Schneider, R-R.I., who suggested the band encourage ``Dead Heads.''
   ``I would guess that about 90 percent of the Dead Heads don't
vote,'' Schneider said at the hearing sponsored by the Congressional
Human Rights Caucus.
   ``That's about right,'' responded Garcia, who said many people
need a specific, positive reason to vote.
   When Schneider told Garcia she entered politics because she
``wanted to change the world,'' the guitarist said she need not
worry. ``We're on the team,'' he said.
   Then Garcia asked the congressional panel, ``Where are the rest
of the people on the human rights caucus?''
   Only six members of the 185-member caucus attended the hearing.
   Garcia, wearing his gray hair in a ponytail and smoking
cigarettes in a no-smoking room, said he'd never been to Malaysia
but was captivated by the rain forest issue because ``I'm an
earthling on this planet.''
   Deforestation has become a top priority of environmentalists
around the world who say that denuding the land destroys species of
plants and animals, creates water pollution, encourages the
spreading of the desert and leads frequently to flooding and
mudslides.
   Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., co-chairman of the caucus,
discussed how the tropical forests in Malaysia, specifically in the
Sarawak region of Borneo, are being destroyed at a rapid rate. At
the same time the inhabitants of the rain forests are being
resettled and some have been jailed for attempting a blockade to
stop logging on their ancestral lands.
   Gilman has introduced legislation to protect such peoples
throughout the world.
   Other legislation pending in Congress authorizes suspension of
duty-free treatment to wood products unless the affected countries
implement reforestation programs.
   Weir, a guitarist with the Grateful Dead, said that some
estimates are that tropical rain forests around the world might be
destroyed in 50 years unless efforts are made to stop logging.
   In Malaysia, much of the logging is done by Japanese cartels that
use the wood for disposable chopsticks.
   Several representatives of the Malaysian Embassy attended the
hearing but were not impressed with the testimony or a film that
showed the plight of the people on Sarawak.
   An embassy official called the film sensationalist and said many
people were not informed about the Malaysian reforestation efforts.
   As for the Grateful Dead, the counselor said, ``I don't know of
this band.''

   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said Tuesday that
housing scandals at his department could cost the government $2
billion but also said, ``We have stopped the hemorrhaging.''
   ``It's a ballpark figure,'' said Kemp, who has suspended three
programs as part of his investigation into allegations of
mismanagement and fraud at the Department of Housing and Urban
Development during the Reagan administration.
   Responding to questioning by a congressional panel, he said of
estimates of potential losses, ``I think $6 billion would be too
high, $1 billion would be too low.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., came up with the $2 billion figure
and asked Kemp his opinion of it.
   While saying his department has not come up with its own
estimate, Kemp said he did not disagree with Schumer's figure. He
also said he believed recent efforts to cut the government's losses
have been successful.
   Earlier, Kemp denounced a system under which highly paid
consultants helped developers try to win federal housing contracts.
But he said he would not ``wage war'' on effective programs in his
department.
   ``I do not want to wage war on programs ... I am not trying to
wage war on the goals that have been set for these programs to help
needy people and low income people,'' said the secretary.
   He also told a congressional panel he was taking steps to correct
``fundamental flaws'' and ``lax accounting and management
procedures'' at his department.
   Kemp, who took over the Department of Housing and Urban
Development six months ago, said he had told agency employees in a
memo that their jobs would depend on putting an end to favoritism.
   And he said outsiders discovered to be abusing department
programs will be barred ``from doing business with HUD and all other
federal agencies.''
   Kemp's comments came in remarks to the House Employment and
Housing Subcommittee, which is looking into allegations of fraud and
mismanagement at the agency.
   ``Some of our most serious problems have come in programs where
substantial subsidies are given to developers,'' Kemp said.
   ``That extra money goes for excess profits for the developer and,
clearly, to cover consultant fees,'' he said. ``We give the
developer a reason to hire a consultant, and we give the successful
bidder the money to pay consultants' fees.''
   The department's moderate-rehabilitation program was criticized
in an April audit by the HUD inspector general who alleged influence
peddling and favoritism in contract awards to developers who hired
former HUD and other government employees as consultants.
   The audit estimated HUD could lose as much as $413 million in
excess subsidies over the life of the contracts.
   Several Reagan administration insiders, including former Interior
Secretary James Watt, have been questioned at House hearings into
what they did for their consulting fees and what the fee-payers
expected in return.
   Kemp said Tuesday, ``HUD programs shall operate without
favoritism'' and awards will be made on the basis of need and merit.
   The housing secretary said that in a memo to HUD employees last
month he warned ``performance evaluations and job security will
depend on how these reforms are promptly implemented and enforced.''
   ``The Department of Housing and Urban Development will maintain a
policy of zero tolerance for violations of our standards of
conduct,'' said Kemp, pledging ``the highest'' ethical standards at
the department.
   Kemp has testified several times before Congress in recent
months, a sharp contrast to his predecessor Samuel Pierce, who
members of Congress say was generally unavailable during his
eight-year tenure during the Reagan administration.
   Since taking office Kemp has suspended, revised or restricted
three troubled programs _ moderate rehabilitation, mortgage
coinsurance and Title X land development mortgage insurance _ which
provide subsidized housing to low- and moderate-income families.
   Last week he curtailed an elderly-housing program in which 30
percent of the projects had resulted in foreclosure.
   However, he has promised he will not use HUD's problems to
curtail the federal government's role in housing.
   The subcommittee later this week is scheduled to hear from two
former HUD officials involved in a project that was pushed by a
former law partner of then-HUD Secretary Pierce.
   One of the former officials, Shirley McVay Wiseman, has said that
she quit HUD because Pierce ordered her to finance the North
Carolina project despite objections by career agency officials. The
second, Janet Hale, was named by Pierce to replace Ms. Wiseman and
then approved the funding. Ms. Hale is now a budget analyst at the
Office of Management and Budget but is steering clear of most
HUD-related matters while the subject is being investigated.
   The subcommittee also is to recall Pierce, who said in an earlier
appearance that he had no direct role in funding decisions.
   Newsday reported Tuesday that Pierce, while HUD secretary, was
one of 2,862 partners in an investment partnership that bought a
Kansas City apartment building through a HUD-insured construction
loan. Pierce listed the $20,000 investment in MLH Properties Ltd.
Partnership II on his financial disclosure forms but said the
venture had ``no HUD involvement,'' Newsday reported.
   Pierce said he never personally checked whether the partnership
had any HUD-related dealings. ``Look, that's peanuts,'' Pierce was
quoted as telling the newspaper. ``There's no money. It's not enough
to worry about.''

   A judge ordered a man who fathered six
illegitimate children to refrain from having more kids with anyone
except his wife.
   Derone Suber, in court to plead guilty to stealing a city
sanitation truck, got a lecture from Judge Frank Eppes on the need
to own up to responsibility.
   Suber, 26, has six children from several women. He fathered his
first child when he was 13.
   ``The state's got to pay for him and his children,'' said Eppes.
``This is one of the most tragic things I've seen in court in a long
time.''
   At first, Eppes wanted to make Suber visit schools or churches.
But Suber, who uses a walker because of injuries suffered when he
crashed the struck in 1986, would have difficulty meeting that
sentence, said his lawyer, W. Barry Bland.
   Eppes then placed Suber on five years' probation with the
condition that Suber not have children with anyone but his wife.
   Civil libertarians questioned the appropriateness of the sentence
but a criminal law scholar said it probably did not violate Suber's
rights.
   Bill McAninch, a professor at the University of South Carolina
Law School, said cited state laws prohibiting fornication and
adultery and said that defendants on probation are required to obey
all state laws.
   ``I guess what he's doing is just singling out one part of the
law,'' said McAninch, who specializes in criminal and constitutional
law.
   The matter probably would not become an issue unless Suber
violated the terms of his sentence and Eppes decided to enforce it,
said Steven Bates, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union of South Carolina.
   Bland said he may appeal the sentence.
   In April, the 66-year-old judge came under fire for springing
soul music legend James Brown from prison for a day to sign
autographs.

   Minnesota asked permission from Congress
Tuesday for an experimental program to encourage poor people to go
to work by allowing them to retain some of their welfare benefits.
   ``The Minnesota plan would reward work. Working would always be
more profitable than not working,'' said John Petraborg, assistant
commissioner for the Minnesota Department of Human Services.
   Minnesota officials asked a House Agriculture subcommittee
Tuesday to approve a waiver from federal regulations necessary to
try the program with fewer than 6,000 welfare recipients in rural
and urban areas of the state, starting in 1992.
   The panel, which oversees the food stamp program, is one of six
in the House and Senate that must agree to the change because of the
variety of welfare plans it covers.
   In addition to encouraging poor people to find jobs, the program
also would simplfy government assistance programs, Petraborg said.
   The waiver would allow the state to combine benefits from federal
welfare programs, including Aid to Families with Dependent Children
and food stamps, into a single cash payment that families could use
as they chose.
   A poor woman with one child could make as much as $6.15 an hour
and still retain some of her monthly payment under the Minnesota
plan, he said.
   Under federal regulations, the woman is discouraged from looking
for a job because she would lose her benefits if she made as little
as $3.15 an hour, he said.
   Seven percent of the families receiving AFDC payments in
Minnesota _ those who remain on the rolls for seven years or more _
account for 40 percent of the cost of the program in that state, he
said.
   The Minnesota plan is bound to cost more money, but the state
legislature has agreed to absorb the extra cost, Petraborg said. The
additional cost of the program has not been determined, he said.
   Rep. Charles Hatcher, D-Ga., the subcommittee chairman, called
the program ``a challenging concept ... ``with potential for real
rewards for recipients and society.''
   Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo., said he liked the idea of ``one-stop
shopping'' for welfare recipients provided by combining the benefits
into a cash payment.
   ``I believe that our public assistance programs are so complex
and confusing that it is no wonder that participants and
administrators alike have difficulty with them,'' he said.
   A representative of the Food Research and Action Center, an
organization that tried to strengthen federal food programs for the
poor, raised concerns that the Minnesota program could force mothers
to go to work instead of staying home with small children.
   Robert Fersh, executive director of the organization, also said
that eliminating food coupons in lieu of cash payments could
encourage landlords to raise rents to get the extra money.

   Federal agents seized 53,000 imported dolls in
a New York warehouse because children could choke on buttons,
buckles and other pieces that come loose, the Consumer Product
Safety Commission said Tuesday.
   The dolls, sold by mail order retailers as the ``Dress Me Clown''
at $5 or $6 each, were imported by Etna Worldwide Corp. of New York.
The seizure took place Friday.
   The dolls had been returned by a retailer to Etna, which failed
to assure the commission that the dolls would not be resold, the

   Gym teachers and coaches may not use
push-ups and extra laps as punishment, says the state Department of
Education.
   The agency issued an advisory _ which doesn't have the force of
law but guides districts _ warning that any forced exercise that
causes pain or discomfort is banned under a 1987 state law against
corporal punishment.
   The advisory was not issued in response to any specific
complaint, officials said.
   Singling out an individual for wind sprints, push-ups or laps
because of lateness, dropping a ball or missing a tackle is illegal,
said Milton P. Wilson, pupil personnel specialist for the state
Department of Education.
   Instead, a student who is late for team practice could, for
example, be benched while others play, the advisory said.
   Some coaches said they didn't believe laps or push-ups were
effective motivators anyway. Others ridiculed the advisory.
   ``It's another attempt by the government to mandate everything,''
said Elk Grove High School football coach Ed Lombardi. ``Pretty
soon, you won't even be able to blow your nose.''

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas bombarded the capital
with rockets Tuesday, killing four people shortly after the
Soviet-backed government announced a unilateral cease-fire to mark a
Moslem holiday.
   After the attack, Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mohammad
Nabi Amani warned of growing public anger against Pakistan for its
support of the guerrillas and warned that Afghanistan would strike
back.
   Meanwhile, hundreds of Afghans marched through Kabul urging the
government to take military action against Pakistan, where most of
the insurgents are based.
   The Moslem guerrillas, supported by the United States, have
fought an 11-year war against the Soviet-backed government.
   On Tuesday, at least six rockets slammed into Kabul after a week
of intensified guerrilla attacks on the capital.
   On Monday, at least 55 rockets hit the city of 2.25 million
people, killing 18 civilians and two soldiers and wounding 51
people, the government said. Hospital sources said that at least 165
people, including 22 children, were hurt in the bombing, which also
destroyed a weapons depot near the airport.
   But in a statement issued by the government-in-exile in
Islamabad, the guerrillas denied firing rockets at civilian targets.
   ``Mujahedeen commanders around Kabul and other cities have strict
instructions to aim only at the enemy's military installations and
to be careful not to miss their targets,'' the statement said.
   The guerrilla-controlled Afghan News Agency charged that
government troops fire rockets at civilian targets to discredit the
mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors.
   The rocket attacks came despite the cease-fire announced by
President Najib to celebrate the three-day Eid al-Azha, or Feast of
Sacrifice, which begins Thursday.
   Najib's spokesman, Sarwar Yourish, told reporters that government
troops would lay down their weapons from midnight Tuesday until
midnight Saturday to observe the festival. Eid al-Adha is the
three-day holiday marking the end of the annual Moslem hajj, or
pilgrimage, to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.
   Hundreds of people marched in at least three rallies staged by
the governing People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, calling for
military action against Pakistan.
   Najib's government has frequently accused Pakistan of direct
involvement in rocket attacks on Kabul, a charge that the government
in Islamabad denies.
   ``There is a growing resentment and anger among the Afghan people
against Pakistan which is directly involved in the war against us,''
Amanis said. ``The people of Afghanistan want the government to take
serious measures against Pakistan.''
   He did not specify what measures might be taken. But diplomatic
sources said the government was seeking the backing of public
opinion for a possible strike on rebel bases inside Pakistan.
   Afghanistan and the Soviet Union have alleged that the
guerrillas, along with Pakistani military advisers, are planning an
offensive on Kabul. Up until last week, guerrrilla efforts were
concentrated on the city of Jalalabad.
   The Soviet Union withdrew the last of its 115,000 troops on Feb.
15 under a U.N.-mediated accord ending nine years of military
involvement in Afghanistan. Moscow, however, has continued to supply
arms to the Kabul government.
   In Moscow, the official Soviet news agency, Tass, said that
``decisive retaliatory measures will be taken by Afghanistan'' in
response to Pakistani support for the guerrillas.
   ``In this case, responsibility for the consequences will rest on
the Pakistan military,'' Tass said.

   President Bush sat down for lunch with
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa at his home Tuesday to a menu of
turkey, roast beef, pork and plenty of politics.
   Commenting on the huge banquet, Bush said, ``My mother taught me
to eat what's before you. In this house, I would weigh 300 pounds.''
   Accompanied by his wife, Barbara, Bush went to Walesa's home in
this seaport city in a gesture of respect for the trade union leader
who helped spark a political revolution in Poland.
   Walesa, the father of eight children, told Bush, ``I'm trying to
keep my kids out of politics.''
   Bush replied, ``It's hard to do. How about your wife? Can you
keep her out of politics?''
   ``It's different with wives,'' Walesa replied, sitting alongside
his wife, Danuta, in their small dining room. Walesa, who is toying
with the idea of running for the new but powerful post of president
of Poland, did not elaborate about wives.
   Later, Walesa said that ``my primary appeal and request'' to Bush
was for a $10 billion package of assistance for Poland. Bush called
the proposal interesting and emphasized that Walesa was not asking
for outright cash but for investment assistance.
   Walesa's two-story brick and stucco home at 54 Polanki Street is
not a typical Polish residence, which frequently is nothing more
than a cramped apartment.
   Walesa's home is located on a big plot of land, surrounded by a
chain-link fence topped with barbed wire, and boasts a small pond,
an orchard of pear and apple trees and a carefully tended flower
garden.
   The two-car garage behind the house is topped by a large
satellite dish for receiving television programs.
   A huge pile of sand and lumber in the rear gave a hint of
Walesa's plans for home improvements.
   ``The house is fairly old and it needs to be remodeled almost as
much as Poland does,'' Walesa said. ``I really am trying to get to
work on fixing it up. And I hope I'll be just as successful with
Poland.''
   Bush replied, ``You must have very cold winters up here, right?''
   Walesa acknowledged that he lives a privileged lify
   ``If I were an ordinary Pole,'' Walesa said, ``I wouldn't be able
to afford it.''
   Explaining his ability to afford such a comfortable home, Walesa
said, ``I used to live in an ordinary apartment. But it's because I
make some money out of Solidarity.''
   He did not explain, but previously has said that he purchased the
home a year ago with earnings from his autobiography, ``A Way of
Hope.''
   The Walesas' dining room was adorned with a woven wall hanging of
the Polish Black Madonna and Child, a common religious symbol in
this country. Walesa offered Bush beer but he declined. The two men
and their wives each lifted a glass of vodka to salute each other at
the remarkable occasion.
   The menu, prepared by family friends, was this: smoked eel and
salmon with lemon slices; a traditional cold vegetable soup called
choldnik; roast beef, turkey, schnitzel and pork loin with mushrooms
garnished with pineapple, grapes, peaches, orange slices, radishes
and new potatotes.
   Desert was mixed Jello with nut topping.

   The Rolling Stones announced Tuesday they have
patched things up and will play a 29-city North American tour this
fall _ their first tour since 1981.
   ``This tour is not historical,'' Mick Jagger said. ``I don't see
it as a retrospective tour, I don't see it as a farewell tour. It's
the Rolling Stones in 1989.''
   Jagger was joined by bandmates Keith Richards, Ron Wood, Bill
Wyman and Charlie Watts in the news conference at Grand Central
Terminal. The tour, which will begin Sept. 1, will coincide with the
release of their album ``Steel Wheels.''
   The band's most recent album was 1986's ``Dirty Work,'' which was
followed by three years of internal conflict and a rumored break-up
of the band.
   Jagger and Richards, the focus of the controversy, hugged and
mugged before a roomful of reporters when asked if they had patched
up their differences.
   ``The answer to that is we both gave up masochism,'' said
Richards, who last year released his first solo album, ``Talk Is
Cheap.'' The band will play only Stones material on this tour.
   The Stones, whose hits include ``(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction,''
``Jumpin' Jack Flash'' and ``Honky Tonk Women,'' become the latest
veteran rock act to take to the road this summer.
   The Who is in the middle of a 25th anniversary tour, while the
Allman Broters Band, the Doobie Brothers and the Jefferson Airplane
are also taking to the road.
   The first leg of the tour includes these dates:
   Buffalo, Rich Stadium, Sept. 1; Toronto, Exhibition Stadium,
Sept. 3; Pittsburgh, Three Rivers Stadium, Sept. 6; East Troy, Wis.,
Alpine Valley, Sept. 9 and 11; Cincinnati, Riverfront Stadium, Sept.
14; Raleigh, N.C., Carter-Finley Stadium, Sept. 16; St. Louis, Busch
Stadium, Sept. 17; Philadelphia, John F. Kennedy Stadium, Sept. 21;
Washington, Robert F. Kennedy Stadium, Sept. 25, and Cleveland,
Municipal Stadium, Sept. 27.
   Additional dates will be announced later for shows in New York;
Los Angeles; Vancouver, British Columbia; Atlanta; Tampa, Fla.;
Foxoboro, Mass.; Detroit; Montreal; Indianapolis; Minneapolis;
Jacksonville, Fla.; Houston; Birmingham, Ala.; Dallas; Denver;
Kansas City, Mo.; Ames, Iowa; New Orleans, and Miami.
   Tickets for most Rolling Stones shows, priced at $28.50, will go
on sale Saturday.
   No financial details were announced, but Rolling Stone magazine
reported the band had signed a $65 million tour deal.
   But the band said money isn't their motivation for reuniting and
going back on tour.
   ``That's The Who!'' Wood joked.

<HEAD>Hochbrueckner Seeks Mandatory Recycling of Car Batteries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A New York congressman introduced legislation
Tuesday to ban the disposal of old batteries from cars and trucks in
landfills and incinerators, requiring motorists to take them back to
the seller.
   ``We need legislation to protect public health when a temporary
drop in the price of lead discourages recycling and car batteries
are buried or burned, thus threatening the water we drink and the
air we breathe,'' said Hochbrueckner.
   When lead prices are high, lead fabricators willingly buy the
batteries from recycling firms for the 20 pounds of lead in each.
About 90 percent of all used batteries were recycled in 1980,
according to Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y. But when prices
decline, so does recycling _ to 66 percent in 1985, the most recent
year for which figures are available.
   U.S. Bureau of Mines figures show U.S. lead prices at almost 53
cents per pound in 1979, 43 cents in 1980 and 19 cents in 1985.
Since then, prices recovered to 37 cents last year, peaking at 42
cents in December before falling back to 35 cents for 1989 so far.
   Hochbrueckner's bill would require consumers to return used car
batteries to retailers, who would be legally bound to take them. The
retailers would then have to turn the batteries over to the
manufacturers or to recyclers.
   Failure to comply would be a misdemeanor, with violators facing a
maximum penalty of 30 days in jail and a $5,000 fine.
   A car or truck goes through several batteries in its lifetime,
often getting a new one every two or three years. So the number of
batteries discarded every year is much greater than the number of
vehicles being junked _ about 70 million batteries per year
currently.
   The legislation would also require a report by the Environmental
Protection Agency on discarded household dry-cell batteries, which
can contain toxic mercury, cadmium, lead, nickel and manganese, and
the prospects for recycling them.
   Under EPA regulations, any business that discards eight or more
vehicle batteries per month must send them to a federally licensed
landfill or other disposal facility if they do not recycle them,
said EPA spokeswoman Robin Woods.
   Violators face civil penalties of a $25,000 fine per day per
violation and criminal sanctions of up to $50,000 per day per
violation, plus a jail term of up to five years, she said.
   Hochbrueckner said state deposit laws encouraging the recycling
of batteries are in effect in California, Florida, Minnesota,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Wyoming and Suffolk County, N.Y. His
bill would permit such laws to remain in effect.

   Laurence Olivier led a troupe of knights and dames
who had illustrious stage and screen careers, and his special status
was enhanced when he gained the title of baron.
   Olivier, who died Tuesday, was knighted in 1947 and elevated in
1970 to a peerage as Baron Olivier of Brighton. The title gave him a
seat in the House of Lords, which along with the House of Commons
constitutes Britain's Parliament. The only other theatrical peer is
actor and theater founder Bernard Miles.
   The first actor to be knighted was Henry Irving, so honored by
Queen Victoria in 1895. Ellen Terry, his leading lady in a
partnership that dominated the London stage for 25 years, was made a
dame in 1925.
   The honors gave the profession respectability and helped
eliminate the remains of a puritan prejudice against actors.
   Actors have continued to appear on the annual Honors Lists
announced by Buckingham Palace.
   Donald Wolfit, one of this century's great actor-managers, was
knighted in 1957.
   Noel Coward, the actor and playwright of ``Hay Fever'' and
``Blithe Spirit,'' was knighted in 1970 and actor Rex Harrison was
so honored this year.
   Among the other actor-knights no longer living are Ralph
Richardson, the ebullient, eccentric actor who regularly appeared
alongside Olivier and John Gielgud, who was knighted after World War
II.
   Michael Redgrave became patriarch of an acting dynasty whose
scions include Vanessa Redgrave and her daughters, Natasha and Joely
Richardson.
   Sybil Thorndike was made a dame in 1931 in the midst of a long
and illustrious career in Shakespearean roles. Many of her later
roles were played opposite her husband, actor-director Lewis Casson,
who was knighted in 1945.
   Other great dames have included Edith Evans, the peppery comic
actress best known as Lady Bracknell in ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' and Gladys Cooper, the fragile star who last appeared on
the New York and London stages in Enid Bagnold's ``The Chalk
Garden'' more than 30 years ago.
   Many actor-knights work regularly despite advancing years.
   The 85-year-old Gielgud won a 1981 Oscar for ``Arthur,'' and was
seen on the West End stage in early 1988 in Hugh Whitemore's ``The
Best of Friends.''
   Peggy Ashcroft, 81, graduated with Olivier in 1925 from London's
Central School of Speech and Drama. She was a mainstay of the London
stage throughout her career, but found international fame after
almost 60 years with her performances in ``A Passage To India'' on
film and ``The Jewel In the Crown'' on television.
   Wendy Hiller at 76 undertook a six-month London run in ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play.
   Alec Guinness, known internationally for such classic films as
``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and ``Tunes of Glory,'' was
knighted in 1959.
   More recently he became known to new audiences as Obi-Wan Kenobi
in 1977's ``Star Wars,'' and as John Le Carre's self-effacing spy
George Smiley on television. Guinness' 1988 starring role in the
American play ``A Walk In the Woods'' was his first London stage
work in 10 years.
   Judi Dench, the latest dame, was honored in 1988 after a string
of critically acclaimed performances. She made her debut as a
director this year, winning praise for her production of
Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing.''

   President Bush doffed his raincoat
during a downpour Tuesday and presented it to an elderly woman who
wildly applauded his speech in Kossuth Square.
   The impromptu move startled Secret Service agents, but Bush
seemed pleased with what he had done.
   Asked hours later after a dinner in the parliament with Communist
Party Chairman Rezso Nyers what he would use in its place, Bush
said: ``It's not going to rain anymore. It's not going to rain on my
parade.''
   The elderly woman had waited for about an hour to hear Bush's
speech. She stood behind a rope, without shelter from the rain, but
seemed not to mind. Most of the people around her were older and
shielded from the downpour, so evidently she caught the President's
eye.
   The tumult that followed the president's gesture prevented
reporters from getting close.

<HEAD>U.S. Sued Over Visa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An organization of newspaper editors and a
congressmen have sued the government, alleging that a Cambodian
journalist and politician was illegally denied a visa to come to the
United States.
   The State Department twice rejected Khieu Kanharith's request for
a visa after he was invited to the United States to speak, according
to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court.
   Kanharith, a journalist, is a member of the National Assembly in
Cambodia.
   The communist government was installed during the 1978 Vietnamese
occupation of Cambodia and is engaged in negotiations with a
political faction led by U.S.-supported Prince Norodon Sihanouk.
   The State Department said Kanharith was ineligible for a visa
because there is reason to believe he would engage in activities
prejudicial to the public interest or would endanger U.S. security.
   U.S. Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., and the American Society of
Newspaper Editors filed the suit against Secretary of State James
Baker III and Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   The refusal to grant a visa based on political associations or
anticipated political speech violates federal law and violates the
First Amendment rights of the plaintiffs to exchange ideas on
matters of vital national interest, said the suit.
   The Foreign Relations Authorization Act says no alien may be
denied a visa because of beliefs that, if engaged in by a U.S.
citizen, would be protected by the Constitution.
   The suit seeks a court order that Kanharith be issued a visa.
   Atkins wants Kanharith's views on the current political situation
in Cambodia and U.S. policy options there. ASNE wants Kanharith to
meet with its members to discuss events in Cambodia.
   The American Civil Liberties Union is representing the
plaintiffs, who include the American Friends Service Committee and
John McAuliff of the U.S.-Indochina Reconciliation Project, who
issued the invitation.

   The Transportation Department asked Tuesday for
more details about a Los Angeles investor's plan to buy NWA Inc.,
parent company of Northwest Airlines.
   Alfred Checchi announced the nearly $4 billion deal June 19, but
department approval is required for the sale to proceed. The
department is examining impact of the proposed sale on the airline's
financial health.
   Government aviation analyst John V. Coleman asked in a letter to
Checchi's Wings Holdings Inc. about the extent of foreign
involvement in the sale. Investors include KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
and several U.S. financial interests, including Bankers Trust New
York Corp.
   Coleman wants the identity and citizenship of each partner and
the percentage share of each person in the partnership, as well as
whether any of Bankers Trust's shares would be held for other
owners, who they are and their citizenship.
   He also wants a detailed statement of the sources and uses of
acquisition financing, the investors' appraisal of NWA assets, any
plans for sale or aquisition of airline assets and details of debt
financing to be used in the purchase.
   Transportation Samuel Skinner told NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier
in May that the department was concerned the acquisition might have
a ``substantial adverse impact'' on Northwest's financial structure.
   But after Skinner met with Checchi two weeks ago, a department
spokesman said the secretary was keeping ``an open mind'' on the
sale proposal.
   The sale would raise NWA's debt to $3.7 billion from $945
million, according to Standard and Poor's Corp. The credit-rating
agency said interest on the debt would cut the airline's operating
cash flow nearly in half.

   An 11-year-old Californian piloting a single-engine

   Tony Aliengena and his 11-person entourage were scheduled to go
on a fishing trip Wednesday morning before resuming the flight, the
official Soviet news agency reported.
   Tony has only two remaining stops in the Soviet Union, Anadyr and
Providenye, before he makes the final hop across the Bering Strait
to Alaska in his attempt to become the youngest person to pilot a
plane around the globe.
   When the 47-day journey is completed, Tony will present a

has already agreed to meet him at the end of his journey.
   Tony, from San Juan Capistrano, began his global flight June 5
from California. His flight plan will take him 19,000 miles around
the world in short hops averaging three hours each.
   While flying in the Soviet Union, Tony has been accompanied by a
Soviet navigator because air controllers on many domestic routes do
not speak English, as required on international routes.
   The young Californian's entourage includes a second twin-engine

10-year-old Soviet pen pal, Soviet and American journalists and a
world-record observer to verify his attempt to circumnavigate the

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of Olivier's titles of knight
and baron and Order of Merit honor; no pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laurence Kerr Olivier, baron of Brighton, was
considered the foremost actor of his generation. His toughest role
was always Larry Olivier.
   With ferocious will he fought cancer, pleurisy and a muscle
disease that made even handshakes agony. He endured two miserable
marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright, contemplated murder
and suicide, and battled his own rages, guilts and drinking.
   Yet in more than six decades on stage and screen, he was _ in the
words of The Times of London _ acting's ``supreme technician (and)
master craftsman.''
   In recognition of his illustrious career, he was knighted and
later elevated to peerage with the title baron.
   He gave the world its definitive Hamlet, Henry V and Richard III,
as well as, at age 76, a matchless King Lear for television. He set
a new standard for film hero in ``Wuthering Heights'' and was the
embodiment of ungraceful age in ``The Entertainer'' on stage and ``A
Voyage Round My Father'' and ``Brideshead Revisited'' on television.
   Two years ago on his 80th birthday, tributes flowed during a
ceremony at the National Theater, which he founded in 1963.
   ``Awe and wonder, you gave us awe and wonder,'' actress Dame
Peggy Ashcroft told him at the time. Director Peter Hall called him
``the genius performer.''
   For Olivier, life and acting were inseparable. ``I have to act to
breathe,'' he said.
   By turns, he loved and hated his craft _ but never would
contemplate retiring from it. Acting simply consumed him.
   Playing Othello, he spent months training his voice to a low
growl and bending his frame to a lope. Each night, he spent two
hours applying shining black body makeup.
   Two things drove him, he said in his 1982 autobiography
``Confessions of an Actor'': Lust and guilt.
   Whatever sex drive he had, Olivier wrote, went into his acting.
``You can't be more than one kind of athlete at a time. A sexual
athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of another
athletic kind.''
   The guilt came from his religious upbringing, he said.
   Born May 22, 1907, in the town of Dorking southwest of London,
Laurence Kerr Olivier was the third child of an Anglican clergyman
who encouraged him early on to try acting.
   It was, Olivier said, the family business. ``Those preachers knew
when to drop the voice, when to bellow about the perils of hellfire,
when to slip in a gag,'' he recalled.
   His first stage was at home, with footlights made of cocoa cans.
At 10, he was Brutus in a school performance. At 15, he donned
women's clothes to play Katherine in a Stratford Festival boys'
production of ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
   At 17, he went to Birmingham to study acting. Peggy Ashcroft, who
knew him there, remembered him as ``a bit uncouth. His hair stood on
end, his sleeves were short and he was extremely physical.''
   Olivier's first professional role was in 1922 in a sketch in a
small touring company. In his first London role, in Alice Law's 1924
``Byron,'' he tripped over a doorsill and fell on his face.
   The early years were tough, but fruitful. He spent three years in
Birmingham Repertory, returned to London in 1928, played in ``Beau
Geste'' and ``Journey's End'' and went to New York to appear in a
murder mystery.
   In 1930, at age 23, he married actress Jill Esmond _ even though
she told him she didn't love him.
   The marriage was a debacle, but they had a son and kept the
marriage going for 10 years out of a ``pathetic mixture of religious
and animal promptings,'' Olivier said.
   But if his private life was a shambles, his career was soaring.
   He piled success _ Noel Coward's ``Private Lives'' in London and
New York _ upon success _ Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet,'' in
which he and John Gielgud, a friend from his Birmingham days,
alternated playing Romeo and Mercutio.
   Said Gielgud: ``I had the voice, Larry had the legs.''
   In 1937, as war clouds gathered in Europe, Olivier joined Gielgud
at the Old Vic company and, along with Ralph Richardson, formed a
partnership that remade English theater.
   Olivier played a dazzling succession of Shakespearean heroes _
Hamlet, Henry V, Macbeth _ triumphing in each. Olivier, Gielgud and
Richardson all were knighted after the war.
   The step that sealed Olivier's stardom was his move to Hollywood
in 1939 to make ``Wuthering Heights.'' It was a towering success,
but also, Olivier recalled, an invaluable lesson in acting.
   He strutted around the set, indulging in ``appalling overacting''
until director William Wyler shouted: ``What do you think you are
doing? You think you are in the opera house?''
   ``I suppose this anemic little medium can't take great acting,''
Olivier replied huffily. The set was engulfed in laughter.
   ``I was a stupid, conceited, pompous little bastard. If it had
not been for the cinema, I suppose I would have gone on hamming away
all my life.''

   In that same year, Olivier appeared with Vivien Leigh in a New
York production of ``Romeo and Juliet.'' After nearly two years of
clandestine love, he obtained a divorce and the two were wed.
   That marriage, too, was disastrous. Though in the early years
they were a glamorous couple in public, Vivien soon fell out of
love, had a much-publicized affair with actor Peter Finch and a
series of others and eventually told Olivier _ according to his
memoirs _ that she loved him only ``like a brother.''
   The marriage continued for another decade ``with occasional acts
of incest'' as she descended into manic depression. Her mental
illness tortured Olivier. He had crippling bouts of stage fright. He
contemplated suicide. Once, he threw her against a wall, cut her
head open and, by his own account, nearly killed her.
   But he blamed himself.
   ``Somehow, the cause of Vivien's disturbances were due to some
fault in me.''
   They finally were divorced in 1961, and Olivier wed actress Joan
Plowright, with whom he finally found happiness. They had a son,
Richard, and two daughters, Tamsin and Julie-Kate. All three are
either studying, or working in, the theater.
   Miss Leigh died of tuberculosis in 1967.
   Olivier was appointed co-director of the Old Vic in 1944, after a
spell in the wartime naval reserve.
   In 1947, Olivier was knighted. But he attained special status
among actor knights in 1970 when Queen Elizabeth II elevated him to
the peerage with the title Baron Olivier of Brighton. The title gave
him a seat in the House of the Lords, the upper chamber of
Parliament.
   In 1981, Olivier was awarded the Order of Merit, which is limited
to 24 living members. He was the only actor to hold it.
   While with the Old Vic, Olivier also turned his hand to the three
films that were to make his reputation as the finest Shakespearean
actor in film: ``Henry V,'' ``Hamlet,'' for which he won a
best-actor Oscar in 1949, and ``Richard III.'' In 1979 he received a
special Academy Award for his film work.
   But Olivier was proudest of his work founding Britain's National
Theater. ``Only a man of his titanic standing and relentless energy
could have brought the project to fruition,'' wrote Alan Hamilton in
The Times.
   Olivier was its director from 1963 to 1972, one of the reasons he
was made a peer _ Baron Olivier of Brighton _ in 1970. Sir Peter
Hall succeeded him in 1973.
   Over the years he had scores of memorable roles, from the fading
comic Archie Rice in John Osborne's ``The Entertainer'' to Astrov in
Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya'' to the Nazi who tortures Dustin Hoffman in
the film ``Marathon Man.''
   To appear truly disheveled in that film's famous dentist-chair
scene, Hoffman kept himself awake for two days straight. ``Dear
boy,'' Olivier said to him, ``why don't you try acting? It's so much
easier.''
   In his declining years, as he fought off cancer _ ``I said to
myself: `I will beat you, you bastard!''' _ pleurisy, pneumonia,
appendicitis, muscular and kidney disorders, he kept at his craft in
smaller roles, including, most recently, a one-day cameo in Derek
Jarman's movie ``War Requiem.''
   He defended his right to accept roles in more dubious projects _
films like ``The Betsy'' and ``Inchon'' or Dave Clark's stage
musical ``Time,'' in which his image was projected on to a plaster
model of his head.
   ``Vital to me, these cameos, spiritually and financially,'' he
wrote in his book ``On Acting.'' ``I've always managed to give them
all the animation they need.''
   His later television work was more rewarding, particularly his
performances as Sir Arthur, opposite Katharine Hepburn, in ``Love
Among the Ruins,'' and as the fallen and foolish monarch Lear in
Shakespeare's great tragedy.
   ``The greatest actor in the greatest play,'' Nancy Banks-Smith
said of Olivier's Lear in The Guardian newspaper.
   ``I am Lear,'' he told his director, Michael Elliott.
   In a sense, Olivier was all his roles.
   In his biography, he said people often asked his wife, Joan, how
she knew when he was acting and when he was being himself.
   ``Larry?'' he quotes her as saying. ``Oh, he's acting all the
time.''

<HEAD>EDs: New throughout with Dredge testimony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reputed associate of Florida underworld
figures told senators at a closed-door hearing Tuesday how he helped
federal investigators stalk federal Judge Alcee L. Hastings in a
bribery conspiracy case.
   ``We think his testimony went well in terms of presentation of
how the investigation got under way,'' Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas,
told reporters after William Dredge finished testifying at Hastings'
impeachment trial.
   Hastings, a U.S. District judge from Miami, is accused of
plotting to get a $150,000 payoff, of lying about it to a jury that
acquitted him in 1983 and of improperly disclosing information
obtained through a federal wiretap.
   Hastings, the first black federal judge in Florida history, was
impeached by the House a year ago and is now on trial in the Senate,
which could remove him from the bench and take away his $89,500
annual salary.
   A committee of senators is hearing the impeachment charges voted
by the House. Eventually, the full Senate will have to vote on the
charges.
   Hastings lost a bid Tuesday in the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the
impeachment trial.
   Justice Byron R. White, without comment, denied Hastings' request
to block the proceedings on grounds that the Constitution ``will
suffer irreparable harm'' if the impeachment trial is allowed to
proceed.
   Hastings had sought a temporary order pending a decision from the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on his
efforts to block the Senate proceedings.
   Senators cleared the hearing room and put in effect a television
blackout as Dredge was brought in through a rear entrance. Lawmakers
said he apparently is in fear of mob retaliation because of his
testimony for the government in a racketeering trial involving the
late Florida mob boss Santo Trafficante.
   Bryant said that Dredge was not part of the government's witness
protection prorgram but that he ``is an elusive figure who can only
be located through the FBI.''
   ``On cross examination, I think I showed up the slippery little
worm,'' Hastings' attorney Terence Anderson told reporters after
Dredge had been escorted out a rear exit and the hearing reopened to
the public.
   Anderson that both he and a number of senators hearing the
evidence struck at Dredge's credibility by dwelling on his criminal
associations.
   ``Everyone involved in this knew that Dredge had a lengthy
criminal record spanning his entire adult life,'' Bryant told
reporters. He said efforts to remove Hastings from the bench do not
hinge on the credibility of Dredge's testimony and that all of the
key points are corroborated by other witnesses.
   The purpose of the testimony was to show the senators that there
was nothing out of the ordinary about the genesis of the Hastings
investigation.
   Prosecutors say Dredge was used as a go-between by Washington
attorney William Borders to solicit a $150,000 payoff in exchange
for Hastings' keeping two brothers, Frank and Thomas Romano, out of
prison. They had been sentenced by Hastings to three years each
following a racketeering conviction involving a loan from a
Teamsters Union pension fund.
   The Romano brothers expressed no interest in the alleged scheme.
Dredge, at the time under indictment on charges of conspiracy to
distribute quaalude tablets, became an informant against Borders,
who eventually went to prison.
   Attorneys and lawmakers said that in his five hours of Senate
testimony Dredge essentially retold the story in detail.
   Hastings emerged from the hearing room for the noon recess and
told reporters that Dredge was ``an incredible liar.''
   ``Quite frankly, I don't like him,'' Hastings said. ``Never did,
never will.''
   He said Dredge's testimony ``has been carefully rehearsed and
gone over repeatedly.''
   In other action, House members acting as prosecutors failed in
efforts to ask Miami criminal lawyer Neal Sonnett about a telephone
call between the Romano brothers and an associate, Phillip Moscato.
Prosecutors say he met with Dredge in a garage to discuss the legal
problems of the Romanos.
   Sonnett told reporters Frank Romano said that Moscato met with
Dredge and reported back that ``a Washington big shot'' could
intervene in the case. But the Romanos said they had no interest in
such a deal, Sonnett said.
   He said he informed the government of the conversation when the
chief of the Justice Department's strike force telephoned him hours
after Borders' arrest to warn him that reporters might be calling
him to task about the case.
   The Senate panel's chairman, Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., ruled
out Sonnett's testimony concerning the telephone conversation after
Anderson objected that it was hearsay evidence passed through
individuals who are either dead or too disabled to testify and
``every one of whom except Mr. Sonnett is a member of one organized
crime family or another.''
   Justice Byron R. White, without comment, denied Hastings' request
to block the proceedings on grounds that the Constitution ``will
suffer irreparable harm'' if the impeachment trial is allowed to
proceed.
   Hastings had sought a temporary order pending a decision from the
U.S. Court of Appeals here on his efforts to block the Senate
proceedings.

   A biologist charged with plagiarism said
through an attorney Tuesday that he will fight his exclusion from
government research grants and will defend himself before a
university committee investigating the charges.
   C. David Bridges, a former eye researcher at the Baylor College
of Medicine in Houston and now on the faculty of Purdue University,
is charged in an investigation by the National Institutes of Health
with using research data from a team of Harvard scientists to
prepare a research report that he published under his own name.
   A report on the NIH investigation, obtained Tuesday by The
Associated Press through a Freedom of Information request, charges
that Bridges made unauthortized and uncredited use of information
from a Harvard University manuscript that had been sent to him for
peer review.
   The report recommends that Bridges be blocked from receiving
federal grants and excluded from peer review programs for 10 years.
   Bridges' attorney, George Bishop of Houston, denied the charges
and said the researcher will appeal the NIH action to the the
Department of Health and Human Services. Bridges also plans to fight
an investigation now underway at Purdue.
   The NIH report said Bridges used Harvard experiment data, which
he saw in the manuscript, to conduct his own experiments and then
published an article in the journal Science without acknowledging
the Harvard source, the NIH said.
   ``Plagiarism _ the unauthorized use of another person's
experimental protocol, in this case _ is a serious misconduct of
science in that it undermines the entire peer-review process upon
which the scientific enterprise is dependent,'' the NIH
investigation report said.
   An NIH committee that reviewed the investigation said it was
``clearly dismayed'' by Bridges' behavior, and said that using
information obtained from unpublished manuscripts sent for peer
review ``is reprehensible and cannot be tolerated by scientists or
the public.''
   In addition to barring Bridges from federal grants and from peer
review programs, the NIH report also recommended that all current
NIH grants to Bridges be terminated and that the journal Science be
notified of the investigation report.
   In what it called a ``Notification to Readers,'' the journal
Science will announce the result of the NIH investigation in an
issue to be released Friday.
   Carol Rogers, a spokeswoman for the American Association for
Advancement of Science, publisher of Science, said the association
also will notify science libraries so that the notificiation will be
cross-referenced in computer files of scientific research.
   Bishop, the Houston attorney representing Bridges, said the NIH
ruling was unfair because Bridges was never given a chance to
confront his accusers or to know precisely the charges.
   ``The charges were reviewed in secret,'' said Bishop. ``We think
if the facts are heard, Bridges will be vindicated.''
   Bishop said the NIH action keeps Bridges from making a living and
could threaten his position at Purdue.
   ``Those grants are important to keep his livelihood going,'' said
Bishop, and loss of the grants ``probably will have some effect'' on
Bridges' tenured position at Purdue.
   ``These colleges and universities, particularly in biological
sciences, depend a great deal on grants to keep going,'' said Bishop.
   The lawyer said that an NIH grant given to Bridges already has
been cancelled and that two research assistants have been laid off.
   A woman who would identify herself only as an administrative
assistant at Bridges' Purdue office in West Layfayette, Ind., said
the researcher was not accepting telephone calls and was referring
all calls to Bishop.
   Joe Bennett, a spokesman for Purdue, said that a committee of
faculty members has been named to investigate the charges against
Bridges. He said the committee may review the entire case before
taking any action.
   ``The matter is not really a Purdue issue,'' said Bennett, since
the alleged plagarism took place before Bridges joined the Purdue
faculty in May, 1987. But Bennett said Purdue could take action if
it appears the university would be affected.
   According to the NIH report, Bridges, a professor in the
department of ophthalmology at Baylor College in Medicine at the
time researching the biochemistry of vision, was sent a Harvard
University manuscript to review for a National Academy of Sciences
publication in the summer of 1986.
   Science research manuscripts are usually reviewed by experts
before they are published in learned journals. The NIH investigation
said Bridges declined to review the manuscript and returned it to
the academy in September 1986.
   The Harvard research described in the manuscript had to do with a
identifying an enzyme called isomerase which plays a role in vision.
   In November 1986, Bridges submitted a manuscript on isomerase to
the British journal Nature, but the article was turned down in
January 1987. Bridges revised the article and then submitted it to
Science which published it in June, 1987.
   Prior to the publication, Harvard researcher Robert R. Rando
learned of Bridges' reports and discovered that Bridges had received
an advance copy of the Harvard study. Rando also noticed the
similarities of the two studies.
   Another researcher arranged a meeting between Bridges and Rando
and Bridges agreed to credit the Harvard research in his Science
article. This was not done, however.
   Bridges resigned from Baylor in August 1987, and went to Purdue
in October. The month before he left, a Baylor committee, prompted
by Rando, began investigating the Science article. The committee
concluded that Bridges did misuse the Harvard information.
   Since a federal grant was involved, Baylor notified the NIH which
started an investigation last October. The report, including
recommendations for debarring Bridges, was completed last month and
approved by Dr. James B. Wyngaarden, the director of the NIH.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir may call a new
Cabinet vote on his proposal for Palestinian elections in a bid to
save his coalition government from collapse, his spokesman said
Tuesday.
   Spokesman Yossi Ahimeir confirmed newspaper reports Shamir is
considering a vote to head off moves by the center-left Labor Party
to quit Shamir's coalition Cabinet and force national elections.
   ``You could say that the prime minister's office should be
interested in holding such a vote,'' said Ahimeir.
   A vote could be called within the next three weeks, before
Labor's Central Committee meets to make a final decision on Monday's
recommendation by its 120-member Leadership Bureau that the party
quit the government. Labor is the junior partner in the coalition
dominated by Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc.
   Renewed Cabinet backing for Shamir's peace initiative would aim
at assuaging Labor and Washington, which both object to hard-line
conditions the Likud bloc has set for the proposal, Israeli dailies
reported.
   The peace plan has split Shamir's bloc, with Likud hawks forcing
the condition that the government first crush the 19-month uprising
against Israeli occupation of the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   In the Gaza Strip on Tuesday, two men masked with Arab kaffiyeh
scarves shot and killed 28-year-old Palestinian Faqar Mohammad
Hassan on a downtown Gaza City street.
   The army said it believes the slaying was carried out by fellow
Palestinians. Hassan's death comes as attacks are increasing on
fellow Arabs accused of collaborating with Israel.
   Also in Gaza, three Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes
with Israeli troops, Arab reports said. The army said it was
investigating.
   On the West Bank, leaders of the revolt called a general strike
in Ramallah and El-Bireh to protest Monday's shootings of three Arab
youths by Israeli soldiers and security agents, Arab reports said.
The army confirmed two of the deaths and said it is investigating
the third.
   ``Killing our people will not stop the intefadeh!'' slogans
painted on walls in the towns north of Jerusalem declared, using the
Arabic term for the rebellion.
   The deaths around Ramallah would bring to 558 the number of
Palestinians killed in the uprising. Thirty-three Israelis also have
been killed.
   In the West Bank town of Nablus, the fundamentalist Islamic Jihad
movement praised a Palestinian's attack last week on an Israeli bus,
and urged the ``use of bullets and grenades'' in their fight against
Israel.
   ``We praise the mujahed (holy warrior) who destroyed the Zionist
bus,'' said a Jihad leaflet, the first issued in the occupied
territories by the organization. Fourteen civilians died, including
two Canadians, when the Palestinian refugee wrenched the wheel and
forced the bus down a ravine.
   If Shamir calls a vote, he would urge Cabinet ministers to reject
amendments to the election plan such as those he accepted as Likud
policy to quell a revolt in his right-wing bloc, the daily Haaretz
reported.
   The Cabinet, which first approved the plan by a vote of 20-6 in
May, probably would defeat the amendments, Israeli papers said.
   Shamir's original proposal calls for Palestinians in the occupied
territories to elect representatives to negotiate with Israel for
autonomy. The final status of the territories would be decided later.
   The proposal is vaguely worded to try to win Palestinian approval.
   But Likud hard-liners, led by Industry Minister Ariel Sharon,
voted for tough conditions including demanding more Jewish
settlements in the occupied lands and that Israel refuse to give up
land seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
   U.S. Middle East policy calls for Israel trading land for peace
and an end to Jewish settlements.
   Shamir insists the Likud conditions do not affect the formal
government peace proposal.
   On Monday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he is
sending envoys to Jerusalem to determine if Israel is serious about
its peace initiative, which U.S. diplomats are trying to sell to the
Palestine Liberation Organization.

Force for space policy.
   He is Martin C. Faga, and he would succeed Tidal W. McCoy if
confirmed by the Senate.
   The other judicial nominations were:
   Marvin J. Garbis to be U.S. District Judge for the District of
Maryland. He suceeds Joseph B. Young.
   Rebecca Beach Smith to the U.S. District Court for the eastern
district of Virginia. She would succeed D. Dortch Warriner.

   A State Department spokesman on Tuesday called
last week's attack on an Israeli bus a terrorist act.
   ``We've seen reports that the Islamic Jihad of Palestine has
publicly claimed responsibility, '' Richard Boucher told reporters.
   ``There are also other reports concerning the motivation of the
individual. It just seems clear that it was a terrorist attack based
on the information we have now.''
   The Israeli government had complained that the U.S. government
did not come out strongly on the incident. It occurred Friday when
an Arab seized the wheel of a bus between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and
forced it to plunge into a ravine. There were 14 killed, including
two Canadians.
   Boucher said he did not know who was responsible, pointing out
that the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had called it a
tragedy. He added that he did not have a single definition of a
terrorist act that would cover all possible events.
   Boucher commented as the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith
released a letter to Secretary of State James Baker complaining that
the department had not condemned the bus attack, but ``merely
expressed sorrow.''

   President Bush is being urged by a group of
House Democrats not to meet F.W. de Klerk until the South African
government ends its state of emergency and releases political
prisoners jailed for opposition to apartheid.
   A meeting ``without any significant political change by the white
minority regime would send a terribly wrong signal concerning the
direction of U.S. policy,'' said a letter sent to Bush prior to his
departure for Europe and released here Tuesday.
   The letter bore the names of 51 House Democrats and more signers
are being added, said the office of Rep. William H. Gray III,
D-Pa.,the House majority whip who cosponsored the letter with Reps.
Ronald Dellums, D-Calif., and Howard Wolpe, D-Mich.
   Dellums is author of South African sanctions legislation before
the House. Wolpe is African affairs subcommittee chairman.
   De Klerk, leader of South Africa's governing National Party and
heir-apparent to President P.W. Botha, has been invited to visit
Washington by Secretary of State James Baker III but no date has
been set, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   Questions of whether Bush would receive De Klerk were earlier
referred to the travelling White House.
   The June 29 Congressional letter praised Bush for meeting
anti-apartheid leaders such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Rev. Allan
Boesak, Rev. Beyers Naude and Albertina Sisulu.
   Besides asking for an end to South Africa's state of emergency
and release of political prisoners, the letter listed other
conditions for meeting government leaders. The letter said political
organizations should be banned in South Africa and restrictions on
leaders of extra-parliamentary groups should be ended.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, sped on his way by
thousands of cheering Poles, on Tuesday hailed the democratic
``reforms and changes'' taking root in Hungary as he pursued an
extraordinary journey to nourish freedom in communist lands.
   ``We want to work with Hungary to continue the changes and
reforms you are going forward with in your great country,'' the
president told several thousand people who braved the rain to hear
his arrival remarks. More thousands lined the streets as Bush's
motorcade made its way into the city, just minutes after a storm
with hurricane-force winds blew through.
   Later, at an extraordinary exchange of dinner toasts with a very
liberal-minded communist leader, Bush said that in this Soviet bloc
state ``the key to economic success is letting the market do its
work.''
   His host, Rezso Nyers, effectively put in charge of the
government nearly three weeks ago, assured Bush, ``We are convinced
that the reform of our economy and the steps we have taken to build
a market economy offer favorable terms for American enterprise.''
   There was no hesitation in this communist leader's assertion that
his country, seeking to recover from hard times, intends to ``create
modern, competitive structures'' and wants the United States to play
``an increasing role'' in its economic affairs.
   On Wednesday, in a speech at Karl Marx University, Bush is
expected to translate into concrete terms the kind of help the
United States will extend to Hungary, including better trade terms.
   Air Force One brought Bush and the presidential party to Hungary
_ where Soviet troops once brutally crushed democratic yearnings _
after a tumultuous scene in Gdansk, Poland, at the birthplace of the
Solidarity trade union movement.
   ``For those who say that freedom can forever be denied, I say let
them look at Poland,'' he told a cheering crowd estimated at 25,000
at a Solidarity monument outside the giant Lenin shipyards.
   He said the struggles by Poles against the Nazis four decades ago
and more recently against suppression of Solidarity had produced ``a
time when dreams can live again.''
   ``We have sown new seeds,'' Polish leader Wojciech Jaruzelski
told Bush before the president left on his 90-minute flight from one
Iron Curtain country to another.
   For Bush it was an altogether remarkable day, and one that took
him from one Eastern bloc country where recent elections placed
hundreds of opposition members in the parliament to a second where
reformers and hard-line communists now share power. Bush's trip
served as a counterpoint to Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev's recent
visits to West Germany and France.
   Like Gorbachev, Bush looked ahead to an opportunity to surmount
the 45-year Cold War and ``end the division in Europe.''
   In Budapest, Bush noted the torrential rains that had eased just
minutes before his arrival and told the thousands in Lajos Kossuth
Square he was scrapping his planned speech to speak briefly ``from
the heart.''
   Referring to the address he will deliver Wednesday at Karl Marx
University, Bush told the audience, ``You'll have to listen to me
tomorrow, I'm sure, at some drier time and some drier place.''
   He added to cheers that ``long after this rain is gone, I am
going to remember the warmth of the welcome from the people of
Hungary.''
   At one point, Bush took off his raincoat during the downpour and
gave it to an elderly Hungarian woman at Kossuth Square, which
starled Secret Service agents. Asked later about what he would have
used if it had continued to rain, Bush responded: ``It's not going
to rain anymore. It's not going to rain on my parade.''
   Later, at a state dinner, Bush toasted his Hungarian hosts and
told them, ``Your nation is involved in an unprecedented experiment
_ a Communist system seeking to evolve towards a more open economy,
towards a more open and pluralistic political system.''
   In turn, Nyers, the chairman of the Communist Party, told Bush
that ``the process of democratization has started. ... We want to
make use of all of the experience gained in the building of the
American democracy.''
   The thrust of Bush's two-day visit to Hungary was largely similar
to that of his trip to Poland _ showcasing American support for the
economic and political change sweeping a nation where Soviets troops
once brutally suppressed democratic yearnings, proposing improved
trade opportunities with the United States and strengthening
cultural and business ties.
   In Hungary, as in Poland, Bush's goal was to nudge a Soviet bloc
country toward private enterprise, and the target of his attention
was a willing pupil.
   Hungary already encourages private entrepreneurs, has a small but
energetic stock market, and permits the sort of free speech that the
Bush administration sees as going hand-in-glove with capitalism.
   Also like Poland, the Hungarians have Soviet troops stationed on
their territory. And, like Poland, the president would like to see
the forces removed, but has not made a big point of it.
   Bush goes to Paris on Thursday for an economic summit meeting,
then to the Netherlands on Monday and Tuesday before returning to
the United States.
   In his final hours in Poland, Bush made a pilgrimage to the
birthplace of the Solidarity union movement in Gdansk, where he was
cheered by thousands.
   ``Today to those who think that hopes can be forever suppressed,
I say let them look at Poland. To those who think that freedom can
be forever denied, I say, let them look at Poland. And to those who
think that dreams can be forever repressed, I say let them look at
Poland, for here, in Poland, the dream is alive,'' he said.
   ``Poland is not alone. America stands with you,'' he said,
renewing his pledge to help the Poles redeem their shattered economy
and seek greater political freedoms. ``America stands shoulder to
shoulder with the Polish people in solidarity.''
   ``Long live Bush!'' responded the crowd of 25,000 people. Another
25,000 lined the streets of Gdansk to cheer Bush's motorcade, and
some threw flower petals at his limousine.
   ``It is here, in Poland, where we can work to end the division of
Europe,'' he said. ``It is in your power to help end the division of
Europe.''
   After the shipyard speech, Bush joined Jaruzelski and laid a
wreath at the Westerplatte Monument commemorating where the first
shots of World War II were fired.
   At the airport, Jaruzelski hailed the departing president as ``an
experienced and farsighted statesman who attracts warm feelings.''
He thanked him for ``the sincere and partner-like character of the
talks we held. We have sown new seeds.''
   Earlier, Bush and his wife, Barbara, had lunch at the home of
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and his wife, Danuta.
   Standing outside in Walesa's yard afterwards, the president
pledged to ask the nations attending the economic summit meeting in
Paris beginning Friday to bolster Poland's economy with private
investment assistance.
   Bush said Walesa had asked for $10 billion in private economic
investment to aid Poland _ not government aid. ``I can give strong
support for that standing right here in his yard,'' he said of the
concept.
   Bush outlined a $115 million program of U.S. aid on Monday and
proposed easier terms of repayment for Poland's overwhelming $39
billion foreign debt.

   Britain mourned Laurence Olivier with tributes and
fond memories Tuesday, and theaters from London to the birthplace of
Shakespeare lowered their flags and dimmed their lights.
   Queen Elizabeth II sent condolences to Olivier's family, who were
at the actor's bedside when he died peacefully at the age of 82 at
his home in the village of Ashurst.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher praised his ``extraordinary
talents'' and remembered her favorite Olivier roles in ``Hamlet,''
``Henry V'' and ``Richard III.''
   Theaters in the West End, London's equivalent of Broadway, dimmed
their exterior lights for an hour.
   The National Theater, of which Olivier was a founder, lowered its
flags, removed its normal playbill from its electronic billboard
overlooking the River Thames, and replaced it with ``Laurence
Olivier 1907-1989.''
   No shows were canceled, however. ``That would have been the last
thing he would have wanted,'' said theater spokesman Stephen Wood.
   In two of the theater's three auditoriums, leading actors from
current productions asked the audience to stand for a moment of
silence.
   ``The quality of work we do here is mostly due to him,'' veteran
actor Michael Bryant told the sell-out house in the National's
Cottesloe Theater following a performance of ``The Voysey
Inheritance.''
   Flags also were lowered at theaters in Stratford, birthplace of
Shakespeare, whose works Olivier defined for modern mass audiences.
   ``It isn't too much to say that Olivier was perhaps the greatest
man of the theater ever,'' said Sir Peter Hall, who followed Olivier
as artistic director of the National Theater from 1973 to 1988.
``Larry Olivier's genius shaped the last 50 years.''
   His genius was also recalled by three of Britain's famous
actor-knights interviewed by British Broadcasting Corp. television.
   Sir John Gielgud said in an interview from the Italian city of
Siena: ``We became in some ways kind of rivals rather than
colleagues, which I was sorry about.
   ``But I wouldn't dream of putting myself up as a rival to him in
talent or equipment because he had this extraordinary range of
classical ability and comedy. He was a great comedian and a very
fine tragic actor.''
   Sir Alec Guinness said: ``He was a giant among actors.''
   Sir John Mills said: ``He had more magic on the stage than any
actor I have ever seen. He was extraordinary _ he was
irreplaceable.''
   Rosemary Harris, who had several stage and screen roles opposite
Olivier, said: ``It's hard to think of a world without Laurence
Olivier.''
   Some remarked on his physical courage. Actor Anthony Hopkins
remembered ``his capacity to electrify people; he would hurl himself
into the role, and that can be quite dangerous to limb and body. He
had tremendous athletic daring.''
   Hopkins also praised Olivier's openness to new young talents.
   ``I remember him telling me: `Never be afraid to be outrageous.'
   ``He said: `You will always be shot down in flames because people
are going to dislike you whatever you do. It is your fear of being
criticized that stops you being outrageous.'''
   Denis Quilley, who acted with Olivier in the 1971 production of
Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' recalled how
night after night audiences would gasp in shock as Olivier, already
64, threw himself backward off a table.
   Mickey Rooney, whom Olivier had called the finest American actor,
said through his publicist: ``The theater and screen will never
again see the vision of the greatest actor who ever lived.''
   Former President Reagan said: ``Sir Laurence Olivier delighted
millions with his unmatched excellence on the stage and screen. ...
Some of the greatest moments in the history of the performing arts
came as a result of Sir Laurence's brilliance.''
   Charlton Heston, a close friend of Olivier who worked with him in
the 1966 film ``Khartoum,'' said, ``Naturally, I'm saddened. But
this represents more a resting for Larry.''
   ``He was an amazingly daring actor, the best of our time,''
Heston said from his home in Los Angeles. ``I had the privilege of
working with him on both stage and screen and his advise to me has
proven an inestimable value.''
   British TV personality Melvyn Bragg, one of the last to interview
Olivier extensively, said: ``He was as English as his own vicarage
family, a man of a thousand faces, a powerful, dangerous and sexy
presence on every stage, and in some memorable films.''
   ``OLIVIER DIES'' cried the newsbills, and evening newspapers sold
fast when rush-hour commuters saw the headline.
   ``He was a very great actor of extraordinary power,'' said
Michael Denton, a physician. ``Whenever I thought of him or heard
his name I saw his stooped figure in black as `Richard III.'''
   Pat Fairbairn, a civil servant standing in line for a bus, said:
``Olivier summed up the English theater. He had that lovely,
dignified voice.
   ``What impressed me was that his professional colleagues always
spoke of him with such great respect and admiration,'' Fairbairn
said. ``When they played Shakespeare it always seemed to me that
they were tying to live up to Olivier.''
   Joanne James, a young London actress, looked crushed when she
heard the news. ``I'm sad,'' she said. ``He's been a symbol to
everybody, with the energy and dedication he has put into the
theater. I've grown up with him.''

<TEXT>
   The Senate voted 97-0 Tuesday to extend for as
long as two years President Bush's delayed departure program for
Chinese scholars and students to guarantee ``safe haven for those
truly in danger.''
   The amendment, sponsored by the Senate's Democratic and
Republican leaders, would write into law the president's order
permitting Chinese students to remain at least until June 5, 1990,
the first anniversary of the crushing of pro-democracy demonstrators
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   But it also would expand that order, permitting the 40,000
Chinese students and scholars now in the United States to remain
through June 5, 1992, unless the president certified that conditions
had changed permitting them to return in safety before then.
   The extension would apply even if the students' visas had expired.
   The amendment also would waive the present requirement that
someone in the United States on a non-immigrant visa _ the situation
in which most of the Chinese academic community here find themselves
_ return to their homeland for two years before seeking to change
their status to that of potential immigrant.
   Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine said the
amendment makes other changes intended to meet the concern of
Chinese students that the Bush plan forced them to indicate publicly
an unwillingness to return to Chinese now.
   ``According to the students such a statement brands them as
traitors in the eyes of their government and provides a means for
Chinese officials to track down and pressure students who do not
choose to return to China at this time,'' Mitchell said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the amendment
reaffirms Bush's basic position on the issue ``that we should not
arbitrarily send home to a very uncertain fate the thousands of
Chinese students now studying in the United States.''
   Dole said also that the amendment does not do violence to the
underlying U.S. immigration laws and ``does not open the gates to
automatic citizenship for anyone.''
   But he said it does ``reflect the best of America's tradition of
providing safe haven for those truly in danger.''
   The legislation does not address what might happen if it was
clear that returning to China might endanger students and scholars
after the June 5, 1992 expiration date.
   The amendment was attached to a pending bill making changes in
U.S. immigration law. The entire package will later be considered by
the House.

<HEAD>Christian Jet Fighter Flies Low Over West Beirut</HEAD>

   A Christian jet fighter roared over Moslem
west Beirut Tuesday just one day after army commander Gen. Michel
Aoun reportedly threatened air strikes against Syrian gunboats
blockading Christian ports.
   Later, heavy artillery duels broke out between Syrian and
Christian gunners and shells fell on residential districts on boths
sides of the dividing green line, wounding two civilians in a
western district. There were no immediate reports of casualties in
Christian districts.
   Police said a British-made Hawker Hunter flew low over west
Beirut's waterfront, from where Syrian howitzer batteries have
shelled the Christian coastline for the past four months.
   An eyewitness said on condition of anonymity the aging warplane
``came very low over the sea from the north, flew low over the
boulevard and then turned west and north again.''
   A police spokesman said Syrian gunners, manning dozens of
multi-barrelled anti-aircraft launchers did not fire at the jet
fighter, which flew at 800 feet.
   ``It seems their radars did not detect the Hawker Hunter because
it flew very low,'' the spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   A source with Aoun's air force, also speaking on condition of
anonymity, described the overflight as an exercise. He refused to
elaborate.
   It was the first overflight of west Beirut by one of Aoun's three
operational Hawker Hunters since the confrontation with the Syrians
and their militia allies broke on March 8 when Aoun blockaded
illegal militia-run ports. The Syrian-Druse alliance responded by
blockading the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   In addition to the Hawker Hunters, Aoun has eight French-designed
Gazelle helicopter gunships.
   Aides to Aoun said Monday the 54-year-old Maronite Catholic
general was planning air strikes against six Syrian gunboats
blockading the 28-mile coastline of the enclave north of Beirut.
   The aides declined to comment when asked how the Christian
warplanes could confront the Syrian air force's superior Soviet-made
jet fighters.
   The Syrian gunboats this week intercepted at least three cargo
ships carrying food supplies and a fuel tanker headed for the
Christian enclave.
   A 25-foot Lebanese motor yacht, the Sea Tiger, with six men on
board was released from a Syrian naval base at Tartus north of
Lebanon and sailed to Larnaca, Cyprus, Tuesday. The boat was
intercepted by Syrian gunboats Sunday as it sailed out before dawn
from Kaslik harbor north of Beirut.
   By police count, the present round of violence in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war has killed 405 people and wounded 1,583.
   The Syrians have an estimated 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a
1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.

   The United Mine Workers' president said
Tuesday he was willing to resume negotiations with The Pittston Coal
Group, and a House subcommittee said it would investigate strikes
that slashed U.S. coal production 35 percent.
   State police were mobilized in southern West Virginia, where
vehicles were stoned and shots were fired at non-union mines.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said he was accepting Virginia Gov.
Gerald Baliles' request that the union and Pittston resume
negotiations under the supervision of a federal mediator, with
Trumka and Pittston Co. Chairman Paul Douglas heading the
negotiating teams. Pittston Coal Group President Michael Odom said
the company had no comment on the proposal.
   ``At the appropriate time, we'll make a response,'' Odom said.
Pittston has rejected other requests that the two sides resume talks
or that Douglas become personally involved in the negotiations.
   In Washington, U.S. Rep. William Clay, D-Mo., said the House
Subcommittee on Labor Management Relations would begin an
investigation into the Pittston strike.
   ``Given the length of the strike, the number of workers involved,
the protracted involvement of both the state and federal courts and
the potential effect of the strike on the economy, I believe it is
time for a congressional investigation of the matter,'' Clay said.
   More than 30,000 UMW members have been on wildcat strikes
throughout Appalachia and the Midwest in support of 1,900 union
members on strike against Pittston in Virginia, West Virginia and
Kentucky.
   The U.S. Energy Information Agency reported that U.S. coal
production fell 35 percent in eastern coal fields during the week
ending July 1, with production in West Virginia down 37 percent from
pre-strike levels _ from 3 million tons in June before the wildcat
strikes began to 1.9 million.
   Earlier Tuesday, about 75 to 100 pickets gathered outside the
non-union Marrowbone Development Corp. mine in Mingo County, company
president John Hill said.
   ``The windshield was knocked out of my pickup truck by a rock,''
Hill said. ``At least one other employee had a windshield and side
window broken. There were nails ... thrown on the road and there was
at least one flattened tire.''
   Hampden Coal Co. officials reported gunfire at their non-union
Mingo County mine Monday night and Tuesday morning. No injuries were
reported.
   State police referred questions on the incidents to spokesman Ric
Robinson.
   State police Lt. Col. G.R. Young said extra officers were being
transferred from West Virginia's eastern and northern panhandles
into the southern part of the state because of violence there, but
would not say how many were being sent.
   Trumka last week invoked a three-day ``memorial period,'' and
Tuesday was the midpoint. Under the national coal contract, Trumka
asked union miners east of the Mississippi to stay off the job
through Wednesday.
   In another development, U.S. District Judge William Beatty in
Alton, Ill., delayed until Friday a decision on a National Labor
Relations Board request that he order most of Illinois' striking
coal miners back to work.
   ``I am going to give you the opportunity to demonstrate to me
your good faith,'' Beatty told UMW representatives in a courtroom
packed with miners, many in camouflage gear.
   But he added, ``If the law is such, I will not hesitate to issue
that temporary restraining order'' sought by the NLRB, which
contends the wildcat strike represents an illegal secondary boycott.
   Steve Yokich, an attorney representing a UMW district and locals
in Illinois, told Beatty some recent developments may ``lead to the
conclusion that at the end of a cooling-off period, we might not
have a dispute to deal with.''

   Laurence Olivier, the foremost actor of a
distinguished generation and the man whose Hamlet and Henry V
defined Shakespeare for modern mass audiences, died Tuesday at 82.
   A rare fusion of superb classical and extraordinary contemporary
actor, Olivier was at home in the plays of Shakespeare, Shaw and
Chekhov, as well as movies made from classics such as ``Wuthering
Heights,'' or the thriller ``Marathon Man.''
   Knighted and ennobled, he was Lord Olivier when he died but still
plain Laurence Olivier on his stage and screen credits. He also led
a distinguished roll call of actor-knights and dames who made
British stage and screen history.
   The founding father of Britain's National Theater and two-time
Academy Award winner was mourned throughout the acting world as the
greatest of his time.
   ``It isn't too much to say that Olivier was perhaps the greatest
man of the theater ever,'' said Sir Peter Hall, who succeeded him as
artistic director of the National Theater.
   Olivier was a ``giant among actors,'' actor-knight Sir Alect
Guinness said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.
television.
   ``He had more magic on the stage than any actor I have ever
seen,'' Sir John Mills told the BBC. ``He was extraordinary _ he was
irreplaceable.''
   Flags were lowered to half-staff outside the National Theater,
and theaters from London's West End to Stratford _ the birthplace of
Shakespeare _ dimmed their exterior lights for an hour Tuesday night
in respect.
   Queen Elizabeth II sent condolences, and tributes came from Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and former President Reagan.
   ``His last few days were very peaceful. He died in his sleep at
noon. All the family were at his side,'' said Richard Olivier, the
27-year-old son of his third marriage, to Joan Plowright.
   Death came at his home near Ashurst, a village near Steyning in
West Sussex about 50 miles south of London.
   A private funeral is planned, with a public memorial service in
London later.
   Olivier was the hero of his own life, fighting cancer, pleurisy
and a muscle disease that made even handshakes agony. He endured two
miserable marriages and years of paralyzing stage fright,
contemplated murder and suicide and battled his own rages, guilt and
drinking.
   He was renowned for his daring. ``However many times you'd seen
him, it was probably the most dangerously thrilling moment you'd
seen on any stage,'' actor Jeremy Brett said Tuesday.
   In Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey into Night,'' Olivier
brought nightly gasps of alarm from the audience by leaping backward
off a table and crashing to the floor. He was then 64.
   He was a tragic film hero in ``Wuthering Heights'' and portrayed
the painful experience of aging in ``The Entertainer'' on stage and
``A Voyage Round My Father'' on television.
   His genius owed much to a sweeping imagination and attention to
detail. To conjure up King Oedipus's unearthly cry of anguish,
Olivier said he imagined the sound ermines make when they lick salt
laid out by their hunters and their tongues stick to the ice.
   Whatever sex drive he had, Olivier wrote in his 1982
autobiography ``Confessions of an Actor,'' went into his acting.
``You can't be more than one kind of athlete at a time. A sexual
athlete is not likely to find sufficient energy for work of another
athletic kind.''
   His career was highlighted by a triumphant procession of
Shakespearean roles, from ``Romeo and Juliet'' in 1935 and
``Hamlet'' in 1937 on stage to a TV production of ``King Lear'' in
1983.
   He reached mass audiences with title roles and directors' credits
in ``Henry V'' in 1944, ``Hamlet'' in 1948, for which he won the
Academy Award as best actor, and ``Richard III'' in 1955. He brought
``Othello'' to the screen in 1965, a year after playing the jealous
Moor on the London stage.
   His preparation involved spending months lowering his tenor voice
by an octave and developing a panther-like lope. He would spend two
hours a night applying black body makeup.
   ``I had the good fortune to be something of a movie star ... so
whatever I did was looked upon with curiosity,'' he wrote. ``Somehow
it worked, and I think it had much to do with the way I adapted the
sound of the lines to the modern ear. The film-going public, many of
whom had never been in a theater in their lives, understood, enjoyed
and were entertained.''

   Born May 22, 1907, in Dorking, southwest of London, Laurence Kerr
Olivier was the third child of an Anglican clergyman.
   His first stage was at home, with footlights made of tin cans. At
10, he was Brutus in a school performance. He donned women's clothes
at 15 to play Katherine in a Stratford Festival boys' production of
``The Taming of the Shrew.''
   At 17, he went to Birmingham to study acting. ``A bit uncouth,''
Dame Peggy Ashcroft remembered him. ``His hair stood on end, his
sleeves were short and he was extremely physical.''
   His marriage in 1930 to actress Jill Esmond was a disaster, but
his career took off with roles in Noel Coward's ``Private Lives''
and ``Romeo and Juliet,'' where he alternated the roles of Romeo and
Mercutio with John Gielgud.
   ``I had the voice, Larry had the legs,'' Gielgud recalled years
later.
   In 1937, Olivier joined Gielgud at the Old Vic and, with Ralph
Richardson, formed a partnership that remade English theater. All
three were knighted after World War II.
   ``We became in some ways kind of rivals rather than colleagues,
which I was sorry about,'' Gielgud told the BBC on Tuesday.
   ``But I wouldn't dream of putting myself up as a rival to him in
talent or equipment because he had this extraordinary range of
classical ability and comedy. He was a great comedian and a very
fine tragic actor.''
   Other actor-knights of Olivier's generation included Guinness,
Mills, Sir Rex Harrison, and the equivalent among the great women of
the stage, Dame Ashcroft, Dame Wendy Hiller and Dame Judi Dench.
   But Olivier was the only one to be elevated to the peerage,
becoming Baron Olivier of Brighton in 1970. The title gave him a
seat in the House of the Lords, the upper chamber of Parliament. The
only other theatrical peer is actor and theater founder Bernard
Miles.
   In 1981, the queen awarded Olivier the Order of Merit, which is
limited to 24 living members. He was the only actor to hold it.
Other holders include violinist Sir Yehudi Menuhin, novelist Graham
Greene, atomic scientist Lord Penney and jet engine inventor Sir
Frank Whittle.
   Olivier's stardom was assured by his move to Hollywood in 1939 to
make ``Wuthering Heights.'' It was a towering success, but also an
invaluable lesson in acting.
   He strutted around the set, indulging in ``appalling overacting''
until director William Wyler shouted: ``What do you think you are
doing? You think you are in the opera house?''
   ``I suppose this anemic little medium can't take great acting,''
Olivier replied huffily. The set was engulfed in laughter.
   Four decades later, working on ``Marathon Man,'' Olivier was
astonished that Dustin Hoffman had gone sleepless for two nights to
look properly disheveled. ``Dear boy,'' said Olivier, ``Why don't
you try acting? It's so much easier.''
   In 1939, Olivier appeared with Vivien Leigh in a New York
production of ``Romeo and Juliet.'' They were married two years
later, after he divorced his first wife.
   Again, the marriage was a debacle. Olivier said he once battered
her against a wall, cutting her head and nearly killing her. He said
he also considered suicide.
   They were divorced in 1961, and Olivier wed actress Joan
Plowright, with whom he finally found happiness. They had a son,
Richard, and two daughters, Tamsin and Julie-Kate. All three study
or work in the theater.
   In the 1960s and 1970s Olivier had scores of memorable roles,
from the fading comic Archie Rice in John Osborne's ``The
Entertainer,'' to Astrov in Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya,'' to the Nazi
who tortures Dustin Hoffman in ``Marathon Man.''
   He offended some devotees by taking cameo parts in Hollywood
potboilers, but explained he needed the money.
   Charlton Heston, a close friend of Olivier who worked with him in
the 1966 film ``Khartoum,'' said Tuesday from his home in Los
Angeles that Olivier was an ``amazingly daring actor, the best of
our time. I had the privilege of working with him on both stage and
screen and his advise to me has proven an inestimable value.''
   Olivier's last film appearance was as an aged, wheelchair-bound
war veteran in the 1988 ``War Requiem,'' based on the oratorio by
composr Benjamin Britten.
   His voice was heard publicly for the last time in a tape-recorded
contribution to save the Rose Theater, the remnants of a theater
where Shakespeare is believed to have acted.
   Borrowing from the famous line he delivered in his film of
``Henry V,'' Olivier said: ``Cry God for Harry, England and the
Rose!''

   Iran accused Saudi Arabia on Tuesday
of planting the bombs that killed one person and wounded 16 near
Islam's holiest shrine during the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.
   Moslems condemned the bombings Monday near the Grand Mosque, but
no Arab nation openly accused Iran of involvement.
   A previously unknown group calling itself the ``Angry Arab
Generation'' claimed responsibility and said in statement delivered
to a Western news agency office in Beirut, Lebanon: ``We ...
consider that this is merely a warning to the pigs, rulers of the
Arab peninsula.
   ``Our action comes within the framework of a final warning for
the treacherous Saud (royal) family, in case they persist in their
treachery. We shall settle our accounts with them directly, by
killing them,'' said the statement, typewritten in Arabic.
   The group also claimed responsibility for an explosion in nearby
Jiddah. Saudi media had not reported an explosion in that city.
   Tehran earlier said the explosions in Mecca were intended to
discredit Iran, which is boycotting the pilgrimage, or hajj, because
of a feud with Saudi Arabia.
   Saudi Arabia, target of an almost daily barrage of propaganda by
Iran's leaders and media in recent weeks, limited its reaction to
saying: ``This criminal perpetration at a sacred spot is
regrettable.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
the United States was ``appalled'' by the bombings.
   The Saudis have repeatedly accused Iranian zealots of causing
trouble during the hajj and broke relations with Iran in April 1988,
citing subversion and terrorism.
   The dead man was identified as Taleb Khan Gamallah of Pakistan.
The injured were four Saudis, three Pakistanis, five Bangladeshis,
two Egyptians, a Turk and a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin.
   Saudi security officials said the casualties were mostly pilgrims
and that two were in critical condition. They said several suspects
were being interrogated.
   Hussein Musavi, prime minister of Iran, described the two
explosions at 10 p.m. Monday as an effort ``by the Saudi regime to
create a climate of suppression and repression,'' said Tehran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, Cyprus.
   A statement from the Iranian Foreign Ministry urged pilgrims in
Mecca to protest the bombings, which it blamed on ``the United
States and its agents in the region,'' a reference to pro-Western
Saudi Arabia.
   When the bombs went off, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims were
praying and walking in the grounds of Grand Mosque around the Kaaba,
a square building draped in cloth that is Islam's holiest shrine.
   The Saudi statement said they exploded on the main road to the
Grand Mosque and on an overpass near the mosque.
   Diplomats said the bombs were believed to be crude devices with
timing mechanisms. The Saudi security sources said the explosives
used were of ``the type that makes a loud bang ... but causes little
damage.''
   Officials set up checkpoints and changed pilgrims' routes, but
allowed the traditional hajj rites to continue.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani, speaker of Iran's Parliament, said: ``Maybe
the Saudis themselves did it to free themselves of the pressure from
true Moslems ... for depriving Iran from participating in the hajj.''
   President Ali Khamenei said: ``The agents of the U.S.A. and
Israel ... again violated the sanctity of divine sanctuary by
exploding two bombs in the holy city of Mecca,'' Tehran radio
reported.
   ``No doubt this crime has been committed by the house of
Al-Saud,'' Khamenei said, referring to the Saudi royal family.
   Iran has demanded the Saudi royal family be stripped of
custodianship of the holy shrines at Mecca and Medina.
   In protest of Saudi limits on the number of pilgrims for a second
year, it also called on Moslems earlier to disrupt the annual
rituals attended by 1.8 million pilgrims from 80 countries.
   The Iranian news agency said the purpose of the bombs was
``distracting world opinion'' from the second anniversary of the
deaths of more than 400 pilgrims in Mecca July 31, 1987.
   Most were Iranian zealots killed when Saudi security forces
opened fire on rioters. Saudi Arabia said Iranians started the
riots, but Iran claims the pilgrims were massacred.
   ``Riyadh thinks it can overshadow its previous crime by
committing a new one,'' said Kayhan, a mass-circulation newspaper in
Tehran.
   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq based in Iraq,
blamed the explosions on Iran _ specifically on fanatical followers
of fundamantalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died
June 3.
   In Abu Dhabi, Foreign Undersecretary Sheik Hamdan bin Zayed Al
Nahyan said the United Arab Emirates was ``shocked'' at the news of
the bombs and condemned the ``terrorist act which contravenes
Islamic teachings and all humanitarian rules.''
   A Foreign Ministry official in Qatar condemned the bombings and
called on all Moslem nations to confront ``these terrorist acts
which are directed against the security of pilgrims in holy lands.''
   The hajj has been turbulent turbulent since Khomeini gained power
in Iran in February 1979.
   Religious extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca that year
and held it for two weeks.
   Saudi forces stormed the mosque and more than 250 people were
killed, including 100 extremists. Saudi authorities later beheaded
63 more.
   In 1986, the Saudis arrested scores of Iranian Revolutionary
Guards who posed as pilgrims and tried to smuggle in weapons and
explosives.

<HEAD>Neighbors' Input Helps Judge Set Sentences In Crack Cases</HEAD>

   Judges here have begun basing sentences for
people convicted of dealing crack cocaine on the suggestions of
neighbors and other community members.
   ``We're getting longer and more creative sentences. ... And the
letters are strengthening our resolve in these cases, also,'' said
Hennepin County Attorney Tom Johnson.
   Johnson cited the sentence of a 20-year-old drug defendant to
nearly two years in prison, rather than the probation called for by
state sentencing guidelines, after the judge received three letters
from concerned citizens.
   In another case, in addition to 90 days in jail on a drug charge,
Minneapolis resident Eli Acevedo was ordered to have no more than
six visitors per day at his home and none at night for five years.
   Judge Ann Montgomery devised that sentence after receiving a
letter from a neighborhood group which described all-day and
all-night disruption caused by a stream of visitors to Acevedo's
house.
   The county policy mirrors a year-old state law that requires that
before sentencing, probation officers assess the community impact of
narcotics in drug-dealing cases.
   Montgomery said she does not always follow victims'
recommendations, but she likes to know what the community is
thinking before issuing a sentence.
   In another sentence based on a letter to a judge, Jerome Gregory
got 90 days in a workhouse, and was ordered not to return to the
neighborhood where he was caught with crack for three years.
   Dave Murrin, a senior attorney in the county public defender's
office, said he does not believe public opinion should be used to
sway a sentence.
   ``It is like `The People's Court' for minor crimes in Russia,''
Murrin said. ``Our system of justice is not designed for individual
retribution. We are supposed to establish uniformity.''

   China on Tuesday refused to rule out a trial and
further punishment for Zhao Ziyang, who was ousted as Communist
Party chief for opposing the military crackdown that crushed
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   ``His problem is still being investigated,'' government spokesman
Yuan Mu said at the first news conference by a high-ranking official
since troops on June 3-4 marched on Tiananmen Square and attacked
unarmed demonstrators.
   On Wednesday, China urged the rival government on Taiwan not to
let China's harsh suppression of dissent stand in the way of
improving ties between the two nations. The appeal, in a front-page
commentary in the Communist Party People's Daily, came one day after
the government expelled a Taiwanese reporter.
   When the party Central Committee ousted Zhao as secretary-general
on June 24, it accused him of supporting the protesters and
splitting the party, and said his case would be dealt with
internally. Since then, however, official criticism has escalated,
fueling speculation Zhao may stand trial.
   One major government report last week accused Zhao's aides of
collaborating with protest leaders accused of trying to overthrow
the government. It stopped short of also accusing Zhao of plotting a
coup.
   Yuan stressed the party charges and decision to treat Zhao's case
as an internal disciplinary matter are not final.
   ``How the problem will finally be dealt with will be decided
according to the findings of the investigation,'' he told more than
100 Chinese and foreign reporters.
   Premier Li Peng, a key force behind the crackdown, was quoted
last week as saying Zhao remained at his home. Putting him on trial
would be an extreme measure taken only if Zhao and his supporters
are considered a continuing threat.
   A trial may force the disclosure of details about the power
struggle that preceded the army attack and could turn Zhao into a
popular hero. The government says hundreds of people were killed,
mostly soldiers. Chinese students and Western diplomats say
thousands of unarmed civilians were slain.
   In an interview with CBS television Tuesday, student leader Wu'er
Kaixi said ``optimistically'' it would be two to three years before
there was another chance to push for democratic reform in China.
``Conservatively,'' it would be seven to eight years, he said from
hiding in Paris.
   Also Tuesday, authorities deported two reporters _ one American
and one Taiwanese _ and gave a second Taiwanese reporter 48 hours to
leave. All are accused of violating martial law bans on reporting
activity.
   They bring to nine the number of reporters ordered to leave China
since June 4. All but two were in China on tourist visas.
   The two Taiwanese, Huang Teh-pei and Hsu Lu of the Independence
Evening Post, also are accused of trying to help a student protest
leader escape China. Authorities put Huang on a plane to Hong Kong
Tuesday morning, eight days after arresting him. Ms. Hsu said she
would leave Wednesday.
   Huang reported meeting with the student, Wang Dan, on July 2. He
said in Hong Kong that security officials told him they had arrested
Wang. However, authorities refused to comment on Wang's status.
   Mark Hopkins, a reporter for the U.S. government-run Voice of
America, also flew to Hong Kong. He is the second VOA reporter
expelled since the crackdown.
   Zhao's successor as party chief, Jiang Zemin, tried Tuesday to
reassure Hong Kong residents frightened by what the use of harsh
military tactics may portend for the British colony that reverts to
Chinese rule in 1997. Many are trying to emigrate.
   ``We practice our socialism and you may practice your
capitalism,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Jiang as
telling three members of committees drafting Hong Kong's post-1997
constitution.
   But he warned, ``You should not transplant capitalism onto the
country's mainland.'' Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents
have marched and signed petitions to protest the military attack.
Many donated funds to the students and helped fugitives escape.
   At his news conference, Yuan said martial law imposed May 20 in
central Beijing cannot be lifted yet because ``the struggle has not
ended.'' He said some people stole guns from army trucks during the
June 3-4 attack and may cause ``further unrest.''
   There have been unconfirmed reports of attacks on troops since
army guns silenced protesters. One Westerner recently reported
seeing a naked body, possibly of a soldier, floating in a canal near
his home.
   But Yuan said foreigners should feel secure in Beijing and said
it would be unwise to wait until martial law is lifted to return.
Thousands of China-based foreign businessmen and their families fled
Beijing in the week after the army attack. Most tourists have stayed
away.
   ``Of course there will be a time limit for martial law, but even
I can't say exactly when that will be,'' Yuan said. The government
still has not lifted martial law in Tibet's capital, Lhasa, imposed
after anti-Chinese protests there March 5.

<HEAD>City Council Bill Seen as Anti-Jackson</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The City Council passed legislation Tuesday
limiting outside income for top city officials, but not before some
council members slammed the bill as a thinly veiled attempt to
discourage Jesse Jackson from running for mayor.
   The bill, proposed by mayoral hopeful John Ray, a member of the
council, limits the outside income for the mayor and council members
to $10,000 per year.
   Another candidate for mayor, council Chairman David Clarke,
succeeded in attaching an amendment that sets a $10,000 annual limit
for royalty earnings by the mayor and council chairman.
   Jackson, whose advisors have said he is ``strongly considering''
running for mayor in 1990, was traveling in Egypt and could not be
reached for comment.
   The mayor's job pays $82,500 a year.
   One council member called the bill a ``cheap shot'' at Jackson,
who earns most of his $200,000 annual income from giving speeches.
   ``I think it looks like a cheap shot, and we always look foolish
when it looks like we're trying to keep someone from running,'' said
Frank Smith. ``It usually turns out to be a short-sighted mistake.''
   Ray said the bill is intended to prevent conflicts of interest.
He has said he began work on the bill last year after residents
residents criticized the council for voting itself a pay raise, but
he did not introduce it until Jackson began to be mentioned as a
possible candidate.
   The bill passed on Tuesday by voice vote without debate.

   House and Senate negotiators trying to
reconcile differences in a $157 billion taxpayer bailout of savings
and loan losses agreed Tuesday to provide civil fines of up to $1
million a day for bank and S&amp;L fraud.
   The negotiators, aiming at having a bill ready for President
Bush's signature before Congress recesses in early August, also
eliminated a $2,500 per day cap on civil fines for minor violations
that was in the Senate version of the legislation as approved in
April.
   Under the current law, the maximum civil fine for bank or S&amp;L
fraud is generally $1,000.
   As approved Tuesday by the House-Senate conferees, maximum fines
for minor violations of federal banking and S&amp;L laws would be raised
to $5,000 with provisions for penalties up to $25,000 a day if the
violations resulted in substantial losses.
   The bill also raises maximum criminal penalties from one year in
jail and a $5,000 fine to five years and fines of up to $1 million
for each violation.
   Fraud in making loans with federally insured deposits has been
cited by the General Accounting Office as the single biggest
contributor to the S&amp;L crisis and the failure of more than 500
thrift institutions in recent years.
   Over the objections of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the
negotiators also agreed to mandate that the Justice Department
maintain a special fraud task force in Texas, where most of the past
abuses occurred.
   A call by the House for a second task force in Los Angeles was
deleted while Senate members of the conference committee accepted a
House provision increasing to $75 million Bush's initial proposal of
$50 million in new appropriations to prosecute S&amp;L fraud.
   The negotiators put off the two most controversial issues until
Thursday: How to finance the bailout and how much of their own money
S&amp;L owners should have to at risk to continue qualifying for federal
insurance of their depositors funds.
   Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of both the conference
and the Senate Banking Committee, tried Tuesday to tackle a third
major dispute, so-called special interest provisions inserted into
the two versions of the bill by various lawmakers over the past four
months.
   ``It's decision time, time to get some of these tough issues out
in the open and see where we are,'' he said.
   However, decisions on them also were postponed when it became
clear there were major differences in interpretations of what
constituted a special interest.
   ``One man's special interest is another man's scam,'' said Rep.
Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking Committee.
   But Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said many of the provisions
labeled special interest are actually in the public's interest
because they would allow some institutions to remain open and avoid
further depletion of federal deposit insurance funds.
   Just before passing its version of the bill last month, the House
struck from the bill more than half a dozen provisions aimed
specifically at helping companies such as Sears, Citicorp, Chemical
Bank, First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles.
   However, the instigator of that move, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa,
said Wednesday he saw ``some mischief'' in separate lists of 17 to
20 special interest provisions prepared by Senate and House staffs.
   Included on the lists were exemptions still in the House bill for
S&amp;Ls acquired by Ford Motor Co. and savings banks in New York and
New England.
   There also is a host of the provisions in the Senate bill aimed
at helping American Express, Sears, the John Hancock Insurance Co.,
Ford, Citicorp, First Interstate, Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber and
individual S&amp;Ls in Florida, Tennessee, California and Texas.

   The District of Columbia City Council on
Tuesday canceled a vote on landmark legislation that would have held
handgun manufacturers financially liable for injuries and deaths
caused in shootings.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Wilhelmina Rolark said she withdrew
the bill because court cases in which plaintiffs are suing handgun
manufacturers have not yet been resolved.
   But the bill, the first of its kind in the nation, faced an
unfriendly reception in Congress, which has the power to review and
reject any law passed by the council.
   The vote postponement came in the council's last legislative
session before the summer recess, which means the matter cannot be
reconsidered until the council reconvenes in September.
   The liability bill, given preliminary approval by an 8-4 vote two
weeks ago, grew out of frustration over the drug-related crime wave
that has surged through the nation's capital.
   Through Tuesday, 229 people had been killed in Washington this
year compared with 159 by the same time last year. In 1988, a record
372 persons were killed.
   Police blame more than 60 percent of the slayings on drugs.

   Army recruits at Fort Bragg, N.C., got a break from training
Tuesday, and Nashville, Tenn., residents collected fans for the
elderly as high temperatures and humidity created sauna-like
conditions in the South and the Midwest.
   In St. Louis, the second heat-related death of the city's hot
spell was reported after the body of a 69-year-old man was found in
his home.
   In Virginia, temperatures that soared into the 90s apparently
pushed electricity demand to a record level, a utility spokesman
said.
   The mercury hit 98 degrees at Fort Bragg, prompting base
officials to issue an alert. Starting at noon, all Army units were
instructed to stop all strenuous activities and training, said a
statement by the base.
   It was 93 degrees in Cape Hatteras, N.C., breaking by 2 degrees a
record for the date that had stood for 63 years.
   In Nashville, residents collected fans for the elderly, and
business picked up at some shelters for the homeless.
   The Rev. Carl Resener, director of the Nashville Union Rescue
Mission, said he was seeing signs of heat stress among the homeless
and that bigger crowds were gathering in the air-conditioned chapel
during the day.
   In St. Louis, the body of Edward Pounds, 69, was found in his
home Monday evening, and his death was confirmed as heat-related
Tuesday, said City Health Commissioner Dian Sharma. An 81-year-old
woman was found dead in her home Saturday.
   At least seven people were treated for heat-related illnesses in
the past 24 hours, including four who were hospitalized, Sharma said.
   A heat warning was upgraded to a heat alert in the city Monday as
temperatures and humidity combined to push the heat index to
dangerous levels. Calling a heat alert triggered the opening of 32
``cooling centers'' where residents can go to beat the heat.
   ``We're expecting quite a bit of an increase in business,'' said
Vincent Wright, a spokesman at the Salvation Army, which is
operating an air-conditioned shelter.
   Virginia Power experienced power demands of 11,800 to 11,900
megawatts in the state, utility spokesman Carl F. Baab said in
Richmond.
   ``We think we set an all-time record,'' he said, but said it
would be Wednesday before the utility determined the official peak
demand.
   The previous record peak demand was set Aug. 15, 1988: 11,756
megawatts.
   Electrical consumption in Virginia hit 11,200 megawatts on
Monday, the high point for the year.

   A bomb seriously damaged a Mormon
church, but no injuries were reported, police said Tuesday.
   The bomb went off late Monday night and destroyed the church's
roof, some walls and most windows, the police said.
   Windows in a two-block area also were destroyed and the sound of
the explosion was heard throughout Santa Cruz, a tropical city of
500,000 about 420 miles east of La Paz, Bolivia's capital.
   The police said they believed the bomb was the work of the
terrorist group Zarate Wilka Liberation Front, which claimed
responsibility for the slayings of two Mormon missionaries on May
24. Todd Ray Wilson, 20, of Wellington, Utah, and Jeffrey Brent
Ball, 21, of Coalville, Utah, were gunned down as they entered their
La Paz home.
   The Front said at the time that Mormon missionaries were
imperialists and threatened Bolivia's sovereignty.
   Police have arrested six members of the front and identified two
men and a woman as responsible for the slayings.
   Officials of the Mormon church say it has 400 missionaries
serving two-year stints in Bolivia. At least 20 are returning to
their U.S. homes ahead of schedule because of the killings and
continued violence against the church.
   Two other churches were damaged by bombs in recent months, Mormon
officials say.
   In Salt Lake City, the church announced it would cut the number
of missionaries in Bolivia and Peru because of ``unsettled
conditions'' in those countries.
   In a statement, church officials said some missionaries who are
not natives of Peru and Bolivia will be transferred to other
countries, while others near the end of their tour will be sent home
early. The church did not say how many missionaries would be moved.

   The Exxon Valdez was kept offshore Tuesday
because of an 18-mile-long oil slick that apparently leaked from the
tanker despite Exxon's assurances that the ship was cleaned before
leaving Alaska.
   ``They were wrong. The ship is not squeaky clean,'' said Coast
Guard Cmdr. Jack Scarborough, captain of the Port of San Diego.
``That's a discrepancy I can't explain.''
   Exxon officials agreed that the Exxon Valdez, the source of the
nation's worst oil spill, was probably the source of the oil slick
off San Diego, Scarborough said. The oil was likely washed out of
the ship's damaged hull by seawater, he said.
   The tanker was kept 50 miles offshore while officials worked to
clean its cargo tanks of oil. Before the oil slick was discovered
Monday, the ship had been scheduled to enter San Diego Bay on
Tuesday.
   ``She's not going anywhere,'' said Coast Guard Lt. Larry Solberg.
``We've told them they can't come any closer.''
   The Exxon Valdez was steaming at about 1 knot as Coast Guard
officials reviewed test results of samples taken from the oil in the
ocean, Solberg said.
   The slick and five steel flaps discovered hanging from the
tanker's bottom Monday were expected to delay the ship's entry into
the bay by at least several days.
   Underwater video also showed at least three rocks embedded in the
tanker's hull, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Dennis Hall.
   ``One is the size of a Volkswagen,'' he said. Officials believe
the rocks were from the reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, that
the tanker ran into March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of
oil.
   The oily sheen, estimated at 18 miles long on Monday, had shrunk
to 10 miles and 50 yards wide by Tuesday, and extended behind the
tanker.
   The environmental impact on fish and wildlife was expected to be
negligible, officials said.
   ``I'm not going to say it isn't harming the environment,''said
Reed Smith of the California Department of Fish and Game. ``But we
haven't seen oiled birds or any other evidence of damaged wildlife.''
   Officials planned to flood the cargo tanks with seawater, pushing
oil up inside the vessel, Scarborough said.
   Once the oil problem is solved, the tanker can be brought into
calm waters so divers can repair the steel flaps hanging as much as
40 feet beneath the tanker, too low to travel through the San Diego
Bay channel.
   The 987-foot ship is to be repaired at National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co., where it was built in 1986.
   Exxon spokeswoman Carrie Chassin said she was not sure when it
would be cleared to dock. The tanker, under tow since leaving Alaska
on June 23, had an uneventful trip until the final leg of its
2,500-mile journey.

   Fox Broadcasting's ``Totally Hidden Video''
gave the fledgling network its highest-rated premiere, following
allegations it was a ``Candid Camera'' ripoff that used actors
instead of unsuspecting victims.
   NBC easily extended its winning streak to 55 consecutive weeks.
   ``Totally Hidden Video'' tied with NBC's ``Seinfeld Chronicles''
for 21st place in the Nielsen ratings for the week ended July 9.
``Seinfeld Chronicles,'' broadcast on Wednesday, starred stand-up
comic Jerry Seinfeld.
   Fox had to substitute a part of ``Totally Hidden Video'' on
Sunday after it was learned that actors were used in three segments.
The show is billed as using a hidden camera to record the reactions
of unsuspecting people.
   Allen Funt, creator of ``Candid Camera,'' has sued Quantum Media
Inc. on grounds the show uses many of the same stunts from his 43
years of ``Candid Camera.''
   The Fox Sunday schedule also got a boost when ``Married ... With
Children,'' normally Fox's highest-rated show, got its highest
rating in a tie for 29th place.
   ``Totally Hidden Video'' got a 10.5 rating and ``Married ... With
Children'' got 10.0. In past weeks, ``Married ... With Children''
has been in the mid 40s in the rankings and had ratings of 8.6 or
lower.
   NBC's ``Cheers'' took undisputed possession of first place in the
ratings. ABC's ``Roseanne,'' tied with ``Cheers'' for first last
week, fell to 13th place thanks to Fourth of July fireworks.
   All of the network Tuesday night shows suffered because of the
holiday last week. The average ratings for all three networks fell
to 50 percent, from 63 percent the week before. ABC won the night
with a ratings average of only 8.9. ``Roseanne,'' with 12.2, was the
only show to get into double-digit ratings.
   NBC won the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings with an average of 10.1. ABC
was second with 8.8 and CBS third with 8.4.
   For the season to date from Sept. 19, NBC leads with 15.1, ABC is
second with 12.1 and CBS third with 12.0.
   The ratings is the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million homes
in the United States that have televisions. The share is a
percentage of sets in use.
   Here is the Top 10: NBC's ``Cheers,'' ``Dear John,'' ``The Cosby
Show,'' ``A Different World,'' CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``60
Minutes,'' NBC's ``L.A. Law,'' ABC's ``20-20,'' NBC's ``The Golden
Girls,'' and ``Unsolved Mysteries'' tied with ``Night Court.''
   The NBC summer series ``Knight and Daye'' made its debut in 16th
place.
   CBS had the highest-rated evening news show with a rating of 8.5.
ABC, which tied for first with CBS last week, was second with 8.1
and NBC was third with 7.9.
   The lowest-rated show was the ``CBS Summer Playhouse.'' The
bottom five on the networks: CBS' ``Paradise,'' CBS' ``Tour of
Duty,'' ABC's ``Have Faith'' NBC's ``The Jim Henson Hour'' and the
``CBS Summer Playhouse.''

   West Germany Tuesday promised the
Philippines the equivalent of $58.8 million in development aid this
year, officials said.
   Juergen Warnke, Minister for Economic Development Aid, told
visiting President Corazon Aquino that $21.3 million will go toward
environment and reforestation projects in the Philippines. It was
not immediately clear whether he specified what the remaining money
should be used for.
   Mrs. Aquino is on a week-long, three-nation European visit to
drum up economic aid for the Philippines, which is plagued by a
faltering economy and a $29 billion foreign debt.
   West German leaders have told Mrs. Aquino since her arrival on
Sunday that there is interest in improving bilateral trade and
expanding investment in the Philippines.
   On Monday, West German President Richard von Weizsaecker told
Mrs. Aquino that ties between the Philippines and West Germany would
be strengthened as a result of her trip.
   On Tuesday, Mrs. Aquino met with Chancellor Helmut Kohl before
leaving for Paris.
   Belgium will be Mrs. Aquino's final stop on her European tour.

   Federal regulators said Tuesday that the Energy
Department may be giving too little attention to issues that could
disqualify Nevada's Yucca Mountain as the site for the nation's
first high-level nuclear waste dump.
   Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff members said they were
generally pleased with the department's plan for determining the
suitability of the site as a permanent graveyard for radioactive
waste from commercial and defense nuclear reactors.
   But they raised two crucial objections to the plan and cited
several less urgent concerns.
   Commissioner Kenneth Rogers said he was especially worried that
the Energy Department was not ensuring that the most critical issues
get settled early.
   Among what Rogers described as ``killer issues'' is whether there
are active geologic faults or potentially destabilizing volcanic
activity in the area that would disqualify Yucca Mountain, about 100
miles northwest of Las Vegas.
   Another is how quickly moisture might dissolve waste and carry
radioactive atoms into groundwater supplies.
   Rogers said he was concerned that once construction gained a
certain momentum, ``a really fundamental question somehow gets lost
in the dust.''
   Initial construction work is scheduled to start in November, and
the Energy Department is to decide by 1994 whether the site is
suitable. If the NRC granted a license, wastes would start moving
into the site in 2003.
   Robert Bernero, commission director of nuclear materials safety
and safeguards, said in an interview that Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins was reconsidering that timetable as part of a ``fresh look''
at the entire program.
   The Nevada government is strongly opposed to the program. Gov.
Bob Miller recently signed a bill making it illegal for any
government body to store high-level radioactive waste in the state.
   Bernero said the NRC had concluded that the Energy Department had
produced a ``fundamentally useable'' plan for collecting and
analyzing the data necessary to decide whether Yucca Mountain was a
suitable site.
   He said the staff had two key objections to the plan: It didn't
include an adequate means of assuring the quality of the data
collected and there may be flaws in the design of an experimental
shaft to be drilled on the site.
   In a related development, the Energy Department ordered Sandia
National Laboratories, one of the major contractors on the project,
to stop work until it corrected a technical flaw in its
quality-control program.
   Meanwhile, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, introduced legislation to
give states authority over cleanup of hazardous wastes from the
department's nuclear weapons plants without going to court. The bill
would demand a concrete cleanup schedule whenever government weapons
plants are closed.
   The bill was aimed at Ohio's Fernald uranium-processing plant and
radioactive wastes at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant.
   Glenn also proposed increasing the power of the Defense Nuclear
Safety Board, protecting the Energy Department's Office of
Environmental Safety and Health from future administrative
reorganizations and repealing a provision preventing the Energy
Department from paying environmental penalties.

   A grand jury returned a murder
indictment Tuesday against a woman whose two infant daughters were
killed three years apart under nearly identical circumstances, a
prosecutor said.
   In both cases, Paula Sims, 29, had told police the babies were
abducted by a masked gunman while their father was away at work.
   The Madison County grand jury charged Mrs. Sims with two counts
of first-degree murder in the suffocation death last spring of
6-week-old Heather Sims, said State's Attorney William Haine.
Multiple murder counts in a single death are not unusual in Illinois.
   Heather's body was found May 3 in a trash can near West Alton,
Mo., about 10 miles north of St. Louis.
   Mrs. Sims was arrested at her parents' home shortly after the
indictments were returned, said county sheriff's Sgt. Don Wein.
   She had been free on $250,000 bond after being charged earlier
with concealing Heather's death. She also was out on $100,000 bond
after being charged in neighboring Jersey County with concealing the
death of her first daughter, Loralei, who disappeared 13 days after
her birth in 1986.
   Circuit Judge Edward Ferguson granted a prosecution request that
Mrs. Sims be held without bond, Haine said.
   The first count in Heather's case alleges that Mrs. Sims intended
to kill the girl, said Assistant State's Attorney Don Weber. The
second count alleges that Mrs. Sims committed an act she knew had
the strong probability of ending in death or great bodily harm,
Weber said. The second charge is a backup in case the defense
contends there was an accidental element in Heather's death, he said.
   The grand jury is still investigating Heather's death and the
involvement of her father, Robert, 37, the prosecutor said.
   Police have said Sims told them he believes his wife may have
killed their daughters accidentally. Witnesses have said Mrs. Sims
wanted to give birth to sons and was unhappy about the girls.
   Heather was suffocated by someone who placed a hand over her
face, the pathologist who performed an autopsy on the infant has
concluded.
   In June 1986, the Simses told police that a masked gunman broke
into their home and abducted Loralei. The decomposed remains of a
baby believed to be Loralei were found several days later near the
couple's home in Brighton, a rural Jersey County community.
   Earlier Tuesday, Mrs. Sims' mother, Nylene Blew, was ordered for
the second time to testify before the grand jury after being granted
immunity from prosecution.
   She spent about two hours behind closed doors in the grand jury
room, but it was not clear whether she testified.
   Mrs. Blew refused to testify Monday, citing her constitutional
right against self-incrimination.

   Twenty-two fires burned out of control in nine Western states
Tuesday, with one blaze in Nebraska growing to 100,000 acres of
grass and pine and a fire in Utah briefly threatening a major power
transmission line.
   A blaze west of Denver destroyed more than 60 structures by
Monday night, including an unknown number of homes.
   Rain helped elsewhere, but thunderstorms in Arizona also led to
the lightning death of a firefighter Monday, the Western fire
season's second fire-related death; a firefighter in California was
killed by a falling tree on Sunday.
   Twenty-two fires that had charred about 119,000 acres were
burning uncontrolled, down from 44 fires blackening 167,000 acres on
Monday, the federal Boise Interagency Fire Center in Idaho reported.
   Fires were active in California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah,
Colorado, Nebraska, Wyoming, Idaho and Oregon. Information officer
Debbie Shivers said 11,000 firefighters were at work throughout the
West.
   While rain moderated some fires in the Southwest, the beginning
of the seasonal monsoon weather could mean more lightning storms in
the dry West.
   A brush fire in Utah threatened two power lines that relay
electricity in the West, prompting the temporary shutdown of a
345,000-volt line, but crews contained the blaze early Tuesday, an
official said.
   The fire burned more than 1,000 acres 15 miles southwest of Nephi
and near the Intermountain Power Plant's Intermountain-Mona
transmission lines.
   Bureau of Land Management spokesman Bert Hart said the blaze's
intense smoke acted as an electrical conductor, causing a
``shorting-out effect'' on the ground.
   ``Quite often in smoke there's a lot of particulate matter,'' he
said. ``Whether it be moisture or residue from plants that burn, it
will transmit electricity.''
   Elsewhere in Utah, nearly 400 firefighters finished a fire line
around a 15,500-acre fire west of the Colorado line, and crews
capitalized on spotty rainfall to contain several other fires,
including a 5,000-acre fire in rugged terrain in eastern Utah and
western Colorado.
   The fire in northwestern Nebraska burned over an area 8 miles
wide by 22 miles long, and officials who flew over the area
estimated more than 100,000 acres had actually burned, said Jerry
Larson, deputy state fire marshal.
   The fire, fanned by 35 mph wind during the night, was within 8
miles of Harrison, an isolated community of about 360 about 27 miles
west of Crawford. When it started Saturday the blaze briefly
threatened old Fort Robinson, the former cavalry post where Sioux
Chief Crazy Horse was killed by his jailers.
   ``We are cautiously optimistic that the worst part of the fire is
over,'' Gov. Kay Orr said at Chadron, about 22 miles east of
Crawford.
   Increased humidity and lower temperatures in Colorado helped
crews fighting three major fires that had burned nearly 7,000 acres
and destroyed 65 structures.
   The most damaging blaze, which burned homes in Boulder Canyon,
was about 30 percent contained, said Mary Ann Chambers, a Forest
Service fire information officer. Residents of several communities
dotting Boulder Canyon were asked to leave Sunday and Monday but
were allowed back Tuesday to assess damage.
   ``The fire is burning within itself and not moving very
quickly,'' said sheriff's Sgt. George Dunphy.
   In southwest Colorado, about 400 firefighters and a handful of
archaeologists gained ground on a 2,600-acre blaze in the Mesa Verde
National Park.
   Fire information officer Charles Harnish said that Indian cliff
dwellings abandoned in the 1200s were in canyons and not damaged.
   San Juan National Forest Archaeologist Gary Matlock, who worked
with fire crews, said the fire was not damaging ground
archaeological sites on the mesas above the canyons. ``They have
been through fires before in the 800 years they've been there,'' he
said. ``It's moving right over them.''

   Congress, now rushing to investigate
allegations of Reagan-era abuses at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, was warned repeatedly in the past decade that lax
management left the agency ripe for graft.
   ``We had too many fires and we just had one fire department,''
Rep. Barney Frank said Monday on why Congress did little in response
to the warnings.
   Problems at HUD were outlined in dozens of reports by the
agency's inspector general and the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress.
   ``Congressional staffs just aren't big enough and members of
Congress just don't have enough time,'' said Frank, D-Mass., a
member of two committees that oversee HUD programs. ``These people
at HUD just didn't care about the programs so we had to spend most
of our time just trying to keep the programs from being destroyed.''

   Crack cocaine _ highly addictive and relatively
cheap _ is now available in almost every state thanks to the violent
gangs that distribute it, the Drug Enforcement Administration says.
   Crack, first noted in three U.S. cities in 1981, ``is the fast
food of drugs,'' the DEA reports in a new study, ``Crack-Cocaine
Overview 1989.''
   ``Crack cocaine literally exploded on the drug scene during 1986
and was reported available in 28 states and the District of
Columbia,'' the report says.
   ``It is currently available in almost every state,'' the report
says. DEA spokesman Cornelius Dougherty added Monday, ``I don't know
if there are any'' states where crack, a smokeable form of cocaine,
has not made an appearance.

   Installing President Bush's choice to head the
government nuclear weapons program would be like ``putting the Joker
in charge of Gotham City,'' an environmental group says.
   Victor Stello Jr. lacks commitment to improving safety at the
decrepit weapons facilities, Greenpeace and other environmental
groups said Monday.
   Stello's selection runs counter to Bush's professed desire to
restore public confidence in the weapons complex by tightening
environmental controls and strengthening safety rules, Greenpeace
said.
   ``Stello embodies the very attitudes that have brought the
Department of Energy where it is today, to a crashing halt,'' said
Stephen Schwartz, a Greenpeace spokesman. ``Putting Victor Stello in
charge of nuclear weapons production is like putting the Joker in
charge of Gotham City.''

   The stifling desert heat radiates from the
sidewalk outside the Tropicana Hotel where the band that for years
provided the music now walks a picket line to protest its
replacement: taped music.
   Inside the lavish resort, singers lip-sync and dancers kick their
legs to recorded music during the popular Folies Bergere show's
twice-nightly performances.
   Musicians are locked in a fight for survival at the Tropicana and
two other Strip resorts, where cost-conscious managers also want to
replace live music in production shows.
   ``The musicians ultimately make the product that puts musicians
out of work,'' lamented Mark Tully Massagli, leader of Musicians
Union Local 369. ``Think of the irony of that.''
   The conversion to tape now affects about 45 full-time musicians,
but it has raised passions among many more who feel spontaneous
entertainment is being sold out by gaming corporations.
   ``We can't have this town _ which was built on live entertainment
_ go the other way,'' said singer Sammy Davis Jr. ``Don't let them
do this to us.''

<HEAD>Documentary-Based Discovery Channel Growth Fastest In Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANDOVER, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With its ``guilt-free'' programming of
documentaries, travelogues, literary adaptations and news, The
Discovery Channel has become the fastest-growing cable channel in
the nation in the past two years.
   Unlike network television, which relies on ratings to attract
advertisers, The Discovery Channel is partially underwritten by
cable operators.
   ``We have a very discriminating audience, and we want to get as
many people into that discriminating audience as possible, but we're
not willing to sacrifice the word `discriminating,''' said Greg
Moyer, senior vice president in charge of programming for the
Maryland-based channel.
   ``People have written us who say, `At last I can watch TV all
night long and not feel guilty,''' said John Hendricks, the
channel's founder.
   The Discovery Channel, which broadcasts 18 hours of mostly
foreign-produced programs daily, went on the air in 1985 with a
viewer base of 156,000 homes.
   Now it is available in 40.6 million U.S. homes, according to
figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co. The channel is available in 78
percent of cable homes and 45 percent of all homes. It has
maintained the fastest growth rate of any cable channel for two
straight years, according to Nielsen.
   The Discovery Channel is a boon to cable operators looking to
bring in new viewers, because, says Hendricks, TDC programming tends
to appeal to viewers who aren't particularly avid television
watchers. The channel is promoted in print through TDC, a monthly
magazine that features background articles relating to Discovery
Channel programs.
   Hendricks, a former university fund-raiser, conceived the idea
for the channel while researching a fund-raising project and
discovering the wealth of documentaries available to programmers.
   Among the programs viewers may see on any given day are
documentaries focusing on travel, adventure and nature. Hendricks
said programs on animals known to eat people, such as sharks and
bears, have been among the most popular. The channel's ``Shark
Week'' of programming proved sucessful enough to merit a repeat this
month.
   The channel's answer to the nightly news, ``World Monitor,''
produced by the Christian Science Monitor, takes a global approach
to current events and has received critical acclaim.
   The channel became the first U.S. television outlet to present
the Soviet news program, ``Vremya,'' nightly for a week during the
Gorbachev-Reagan summit. The channel has also presented a critically
praised, seven-part historical look at the Bible and given viewers a
live look at a coral reef in the Red Sea.
   ``We've defined the whole niche of documentary television,''
Hendricks said.
   ``When I first put together a proposal there were some people
exploring a travel channel, a science channel and others. Those were
all subniches. What we've done is define an entire niche, especially
with the word `discovery'.''
   ``The Discovery Channel is very good television, although I think
it's somewhat limited in scope,'' said Art Chapman, television
critic for the Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram and president of the
Television Critics Association.
   ``I would not want my television (dial) welded to The Discovery
Channel ... but if you're saying you can rely on it for good,
dependable quality programming, yes, in that way it is guilt-free
television.''
   Hendricks and Moyer both said they take a free-wheeling approach
to programming. A live shot from an African watering hole, where
viewers would pop in from time to time to see what is happening, is
planned for September.
   ``I think there is something magic about live TV,'' Hendricks
said. ``I remember the first moment when there were live
coast-to-coast shots side by side. I think it's something to be able
to sit in your living room and be on the plains of the Serengeti.''

<HEAD>Civil Rights Battles Once Fought in Streets Now Fought in Court</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Civil rights battles no longer are being
fought in the streets of Birmingham, where snarling police dogs and
fire hoses trained on black demonstrators made the city a symbol of
segregationism in the 1960s.
   Today the battlefield is the courtroom, and civil rights leaders
view with alarm U.S. Supreme Court decisions threatening
affirmative-action and minority business set-aside plans and
limiting challenges to racial harassment.
   The high court ruled 5-4 in June that white Birmingham
firefighters have the right to go to court to challenge as reverse
discrimination an affirmative action plan that helped increase the
number of black firefighters and officers.
   The ruling is part of ``a carefully designed plan to turn the
clock back on affirmative action, period, everywhere,'' says Richard
Arrington, Birmingham's first black mayor. ``It's going to be a
long, hot summer.''
   The city also will be among those affected by a Supreme Court
ruling that a Richmond, Va., set-aside program was reverse
discrimination. In a third ruling that worried civil rights leaders,
the court prohibited, in a North Carolina case, the use of an
anti-discrimination law by victims of racial harassment.
   The legal battle over Birmingham's affirmative-action plan could
last 10 to 15 years, said Arrington, who wants Congress to let
cities continue affirmative action ``and put behind us this old
bitter fight about race.''
   Birmingham, a city of 276,000, 55 percent black, began its
program eight years ago. Now 118 of 497 firefighters are black, as
are 38 of 151 officers.
   The city contended it has acted under a court-ordered consent
decree and that whites had a chance to complain when the plan was
being considered but did not. White firefighters say they weren't
party to the lawsuit that led to the plan, and the Supreme Court
ruling allows them to challenge it in court.
   ``We were happy with it,'' said Lt. Charlie Brush, president of
the Birmingham Firefighters Association local. A number of those who
originally challenged affirmative action are still in the department
and many haven't been promoted; others left because they were passed
over in favor of blacks.
   ``We know this doesn't end the case necessarily,'' Brush said.
   Jackie Barton, a black captain, withdrew from the union when it
hired attorneys for the white firefighters. ``I realize union
members aren't going to agree with everything the union does, but I
didn't want to pay dues to help keep myself down.''
   Barton, who was hired in 1977, said that without affirmative
action he probably wouldn't have been promoted to captain since he
was 39th on a test for applicants. He called the ruling ``a
wrongdoing to all city employees.''
   Basing promotions only on seniority would be unfair to blacks,
Barton said, because the city did not start large-scale minority
hiring until the 1970s.
   ``Firefighters can miss more questions on qualifying tests if
they have more seniority,'' he said. ``When I received my first
promotion, candidates received one point for each year of seniority.
Blacks haven't had the opportunity to be on the job as long as some
firefighters.''
   Union attorney Ray Fitzpatrick said the ruling was a step toward
ending ``race-based quota promotions'' that discriminate against
whites. The union has not developed an alternate hiring plan, he
said. ``Birmingham has never been willing to engage in any
meaningful discussions with the white employees.''
   The firefighters' case is expected to go to U.S. District Court
here for trial, but no date has been set. Fitzpatrick said the white
firefighters would like to work with the city to settle the case and
avoid a trial. ``Perhaps now that they have this additional guidance
from the court they will be willing.''
   Any settlement would have to include back pay, seniority and
promotions for those who have been passed over, he said. ``People
are being denied advancement in their jobs solely on the basis of
race and that's wrong.''
   Birmingham also is trying to settle issues raised by the Supreme
Court's ruling in the Richmond case.
   A contractors' group, Associated General Contractors, has been
fighting a program that sets aside 35 percent of city work for
minority companies. AGC won a state court ruling overturning the
program but the state Supreme Court halted implementation of the
lower-court order pending a city appeal. The sides are talking to a
mediator in an effort to settle the matter.
   The city has considered changing from voluntary goals to a
program that would set aside a fixed percentage of contracts for
disadvantaged firms instead of just black-owned firms. The idea is
that this would survive legal challenges since it would give no
preferences based on race.
   AGC claims the city has coerced white contractors into using
black-owned businesses as subcontractors on city projects. City
officials deny this, claiming the city is trying to correct decades
of discrimination.
   During the state court hearing, AGC attorney Jim Starnes said his
clients were at a disadvantage because ``almighty Big Brother
government over here can do anything it wants to do.''
   Arrington said it was important to try to help its black
businesses. ``The need is not only tied to the issue of fairness and
justice,'' he said. ``The need is also tied to the city's need for
economic development.''
   Birmingham discriminated against blacks in the 1960s and before
in housing, business, employment and voting, Arrington said.
   Citing the tests once given to discourage blacks from registering
to vote, he added, ``I grew up watching my mother and father and a
number of adults study a long list of questions they hoped they'd
know the answers to when they got to the Board of Registrars.''

<HEAD>A Slowdown Isn't Always Stressful: Sometimes It Brings Relief</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In some ways economic slowdowns get a bad rap.
Ask your next-door neighbors, who probably are thanking their stars
that the slowdown has brought down interest rates.
   Like millions of others, these neighbors probably have an
interest-sensitive home mortgage that was beginning to scare the
wits out of them. Over the past couple of years it has been rising,
along with their fears.
   With good reason. Many homeowners have mortgages that, at the
upper rate limits, are capable of consuming half their take-home
pay. That, say most financial advisers, leaves an insufficient
amount for other necessities.
   It didn't begin that way. When they obtained the mortgage it was
at a rate that probably took no more than 28 percent of their
take-home pay. But even at that rate they knew it would be a
struggle, because they had other bills.
   As recently as last spring, some forecasters were talking about
even higher rates, spreading terror among homeowners. In some
instances, higher rates would mean negative amortization _ instead
of being reduced, the loan would enlarge.
   A survey in April for the International Association of Financial
Planning showed that fears of inability to pay the home mortgage
became the chief financial concern of American households.
   Asked to name their two or three biggest financial concerns, the
households interviewed put ``payments on the house'' first. A year
earlier it had ranked behind monthly bills, medical bills and
inflation.
   Among households with incomes of $50,000 and up, mortgage fears
more than tripled, according to the survey, which was conducted for
the IAFP by The Gallup Organization.
   While the survey didn't say so, many of these home loans were
obtained at first-year rates, or rates that would be suddenly
adjusted upwards for subsequent years.
   Many borrowers didn't mind that. They would have a year to
prepare, and in that time they looked forward to the value of their
property soaring. That was a soothing thought. It's the way people
think when times are good.
   The real estate market changed in the meantime. Housing prices
have actually fallen in some areas, especially where prices are high
and incomes have failed to keep pace. And interest rates are sharply
higher.
   In the three years the IAFP survey has been conducted, ``payments
on the house'' has always ranked among the top sources of anxiety.
It was listed first by 19 percent of respondents, but by 21 percent
of the higher-income segment.
   That survey showed a great deal of other financial stress in the
lives of Americans.
   Forty-three percent, for example, said they were concerned with
outliving their retirement money. When asked what plans they had for
retirement, 25 percent of the respondents said they didn't know. And
a third of them said they expected someone in their families to need
long-term medical care.
   In such a stressful environment, an economic retrenchment that
brings down the monthly mortgage payment can't be all bad.

<TEXT>
   At least twice a week for 12 years,
baritone Stephen Bardsley has made the 50-mile drive to Temple
Square, the ``Crossroads of the West'' that is home to the venerable
Mormon Tabernacle Choir.
   He is paid no money, but as a member of the world's largest and
best-known choir, Bardsley has sung at presidential inaugurations
and the Olympic Games and in tours all over the world.
   The commuting might be tiresome, but never the singing.
   ``Once you sit in that seat, you just get away from the whole
world, and you get your soul into singing for the whole world,''
said Bardsley, 48, a customer service manager at a computer company
in Provo.
   The choir has been singing for the world for a long time.
   Sunday is the 325-voice choir's 60th anniversary broadcast of
``Music and the Spoken Word,'' which with 3,126 live Sunday
performances is the longest-running program in the history of
American radio.
   President Bush and former President Reagan, whose inaugurations
featured the choir, will deliver videotaped tributes.
   The broadcasts are heard by millions on about 400 domestic
stations as well as in Europe on Armed Forces Radio Network and in a
dozen nations with English-speaking programs. The choir also is seen
on scores of syndicated telecasts.
   NBC carried the program from 1929 to 1932, when Utah's KSL Radio
switched to CBS Radio. Since then, CBS has provided the program to
its affiliates as a public service for ``a broad range of listeners
... it's very well-received,'' said John Burrows, a radio network
vice president.
   The choir had its genesis in 1847 in the arid Salt Lake Valley
where Brigham Young led his Mormon pioneers, many of them immigrants
who brought along the rich musical traditions of the British Isles.
   Indeed, when Young sent bands of farmers out to colonize the
surrounding territory, he insisted each group should include a
metalworker and a woodworker ``and there must be someone who can
handle music so that people can sing,'' said Jerold Ottley, 55, a
white-haired tenor and the choir's conductor since 1975.
   But Ottley said the choir's identity was sealed in 1867 on
completion of the domed Tabernacle, a 250-foot-long, 150-foot-wide
auditorium with acoustics so refined that the curved walls will
carry a whisper from end to end.
   As always, the choir's members must be active in the 6.7
million-member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As with
the faith's lay clergy, choir service is considered a ``calling.''
   Second alto Jeanette Watkins, 54, is a Salt Lake tax attorney,
mother of four and a nine-year veteran who shares the devotion of
her fellow singers. She recalls 1988's grueling three-week tour of
the South Pacific and a March sojourn to Disneyworld at the peak of
the tax season.
   ``I thought, if the Lord wants me to go to Florida, I'll just get
my work done,'' she said.
   The choir itself is a non-profit organization financed by
donations and proceeds from tours and more than 116 record albums.
The selections range from frontier Mormon hymns and patriotic songs
to Handel's ``Messiah'' and operatic overtures.
   Five records are million-sellers, including the disc with the
choir's signature piece, ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' which
won a Grammy award.
   A staff of 24 handles logistics and business matters. The
production company is Bonneville International, the church's
communications arm and owner of KSL.
   Ottley, a Fulbright scholar with a doctorate in music pedagogy,
took the podium shortly after the resignation of the choir's
conductor of 17 years, Richard P. Condie.
   Where Condie concentrated on rich tonal qualities, Ottley has
emphasized discipline and precision _ no easy task with an average
of 290 voices singing 350 pieces in 145 rehearsals and performances
a year.
   He also implemented rigorous auditions to test a candidate's
ability to meet demands on time and energy as well as musical
skills, specifically the ability to read and quickly assimilate a
part.
   By decree of church leadership, volunteers must be at least 30,
old enough to have established families and careers. They can serve
20 years or until age 60.
   Older singers possess both the discipline and mature voices
necessary for a choir that has no doubts about its place in music.
   ``The choir has become a part of the fabric of the nation
culturally, and a great deal is expected of it because it's been
around so long,'' Ottley said. ``We are an amateur organization
participating in a professional arena.
   ``We also are a representative of the church, an ambassador,'' he
said. ``We have to represent the church in a dignified,
approachable, yet appropriate way. And that requires excellence.''
   Backing the choir when it is at home is the Tabernacle's familiar
206-rank, five-keyboard Aeolian-Skinner organ with its more than
11,600 gleaming pipes.
   By no means the largest or oldest such instrument, the organ
nevertheless possesses ``dynamic levels, contrasts, subtlety of
tonal shadings ... from the softest whisper to the most dramatic
fanfares,'' said John Longhurst, one of three choir organists.
   For 40 years, Richard L. Evans delivered the non-denominational
sermons that punctuate the half-hour radio program. He was succeeded
in 1972 by KSL's corporate news director, J. Spencer Kinard.
   For Bardsley, the baritone from Provo, membership in the choir is
a privileged extension of the Mormon traditions of spirituality and
patriotism.
   ``In the Mormon faith we have a way of bearing our testimony
about the things that we feel, and we can do that through music,''
he said. ``It's just a way of talking to people, of communicating.''

   He says there is only limited desire to use the J-7 permanently.
   ``Dr. DeVries is still approved by the FDA to do three more
permanent implants and hasn't done a case in more than three
years,'' Jarvik says. ``He seems to have little further interest in
doing it.''
   Jarvik is now in New York working on a new permanently
implantable artificial heart, the Jarvik-2000.
   The National Institutes of Health, under political pressure,
announced last July that it was reversing its planned suspension of
a $20 million program to develop a self-powered, permanent
artificial heart.
   Unlike the current devices, they would not require bulky external
drive units and infection-inducing external lines. They would be
powered by transducer belts or vests and would allow the user to
move around.
   But such heart pumps are not expected to be ready for
experimental use for at least a few years. That's what prompted
Copeland to call for interim measures.
   Permanent implants would be a reasonable response to dealing with
the growing number of end-stage heart patients too sick or too old
to qualify for transplants, Copeland says.
   ``Admittedly, they wouldn't play tennis, go swimming, be too
active. They'd be tethered, but they'd be alive,'' the surgeon says.
   Copeland also says numerous questions, such as whether infection
necessarily develops inside a permanent artificial heart, need
answering before development of a new-generation device.
   Copeland says the public views permanent artificial hearts as
science fiction. If another round of permanent implants began, he
says, it would draw the kind of media attention focused on DeVries
and the first modern artificial implant patients _ Barney Clark in
December 1982 and William Schroeder in November 1984.
   As of mid-May, 106 of 146 artificial heart bridge-to-transplant
patients went on to receive transplants. Seventy-three of them
survived, says Gary Cole, executive vice president of Salt Lake
City-based Symbion Inc. An additional 35 patients did not survive to
have subsequent surgery, and the others were awaiting transplants.
   In March 1985, Copeland implanted an unauthorized device known as
the Phoenix Heart in a patient who had rejected a transplant. The
man lived on the device for 11 hours before receiving a second donor
heart but died about 36 hours later of complications unrelated to
the device.
   On Aug. 29, 1985, Copeland implanted the first Jarvik-7 to be
used as a temporary bridge, and nine days later patient Michael
Drummond received a transplant. Drummond works in a grocery store
today.
   Copeland says surgical teams have learned a great deal about
heart bridging from their limited experience.
   Copeland's team has a 34-year-old patient who on Feb. 28 received
a J-7-70 intended as a bridge, but no suitable donor heart was found
until June 20. The man has been making a slow recovery.
   A transplant optimally should be performed within three weeks
after the artificial heart is implanted because of the rapid growth
of scar tissue around it, which must be cut through and bleeds
profusely during transplantation, Copeland says.
   He speculated that such adhesions probably would be good in the
long term for a permanent implant because they bring blood around
the artificial heart ``and police it from a microbiologic point of
view.''
   Each of DeVries' permanent implant patients bled massively,
suffered the destruction of red blood cells that led to kidney
failure or developed infections that led to endocarditis, or
inflammation of the heart's lining membrane, Copeland says.
   But he says Bernadette Chayrez, his patient who survived for 244
days in 1986 on a second Jarvik-7-70, after her body rejected a
tranplant following an initial Jarvik implantation, suffered neither
endocarditis nor severe stroke.
   She did sustain a localized stroke 218 days after the second
implant and developed a chest infection a week later, neither of
which proved fatal, Copeland says. In the autopsy, the Jarvik-7
showed no sign of infection, he says.
   There are ways to prevent infections, ``and we're going to try
some of those ways. I'm not sure that we've got the answers right
here to hand out, but I think that we need to try this,'' he says.
``I don't think there's any reason for not doing it.''
   Jarvik says the question is whether more research energy and
money should be invested in compressed air-driven hearts.
   While there is ``good evidence'' that many people would live for
years, Jarvik says, the emphasis should be put on ``making something
that's really practical available. And I don't think that that's
going to be accomplished with compressed air-driven hearts.''
   ``I do think Dr. Copeland is terrific and he's done really
excellent work, and I understand his point, but I'd like to see that
energy and urgency that he suggests because of the lack of donors
directed into electric artificial heart research,'' Jarvik adds. ``I
think it would do more good in the long run.''

<HEAD>Dutch Public Swings From Adulation to Condemnation of U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paul Leenheer took part in a
violent anti-American demonstration outside the U.S. Consulate in
1982, raging at what he thought was U.S. culpability in the shooting
deaths of four Dutch journalists covering a firefight in El Salvador.
   Nowadays, the 31-year-old Dutch lawyer is legal adviser to the
Netherlands branch of a large American company.
   ``If anyone would have told me that back in 1982, I would have
thrown him out of the house,'' Leenheer said prior to President
Bush's 24-hour visit to the Netherlands on Monday.
   Leenheer's radical about-face mirrors the Dutch public's often
simultaneous adulation and condemnation of the United States, this
nation's most important ally, a major trading partner and its
cultural idol.
   ``Either we tend to see the United States as the font of all
evil, or we think in patronizing terms of endearment in the sense
of, `Oh well, those Americans ...','' said Johan Lammers, a
professor of modern American history at Leiden University.
   ``We're apparently unable to perceive of the Unites States as
just a nation, albeit a powerful nation.''
   In three decades, Dutch public opinion has been drenched by just
as many waves of anti-American sentiment, although Lammers observed
that those feelings ``have always been superficial.'' Throughout
those public mood swings, the various Dutch governments have stayed
a staunch friend and ally of the United States, if not an advocate
of all its foreign policy positions.
   In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Dutch police fought pitched
battles with students protesting U.S. involvement in the Vietnam
War. In 1968, several demonstrators were sentenced to two-week jail
terms for calling President Johnson a ``murderer.'' Insulting the
head of a friendly state was a criminal offense in the Netherlands
at the time.
   Later in the 1970s, critics of the United States backed the
influential peace movement here, which spearheaded eight tumultuous
years of opposition to deployment of U.S.-built, medium-range
nuclear missiles.
   Now the peace movement has all but withered away because of the
1987 superpower pact banning all medium-range missiles from Europe.
   The latest outbreak of anti-American sentiment has focused on the
widely held perception among the Dutch intelligentsia that the U.S.
government is meddling in Central American affairs, especially the
Reagan administration's attempts to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista
government.
   But Lammers noted that ``the Dutch government has not at any time
been anti-American; on the contrary, the Netherlands has always been
one of the United States' most faithful allies.''
   ``The relations with the United States are the at the root of our
security policy, and those ties will not be severed,'' said Relus
ter Beek, a prominent parliamentarian for the Labor Party, which is
primed for power after more than 10 years in opposition.
   Premier Ruud Lubbers' center-right government resigned in May
because of internal differences over how to finance an environmental
clean-up, and a center-left coalition of Lubbers' Christian
Democrats and Labor is widely expected after elections scheduled for
Sept. 6.
   In the dispute over whether to deploy NATO's medium-range cruise
missiles on Dutch soil, Labor led the parliamentary battle against
deployment.
   But ter Beek said ``the cruise missile episode was a mere ripple.
In a good friendship, such things hardly matter.''
   The U.S.-Dutch friendship dates back more than two centuries,
when the Dutch were among the first to establish diplomatic ties
with the fledgling American republic and loaned money to it to fight
the British.
   The financial links are still strong, with the Netherlands the
second-largest investor in the United States.
   And the cultural ties are described by historian Lammers as ``the
Americanization of daily life'' here. The public is bombarded with
American movies, television soap operas and fashions, while
television and radio commercials increasingly use heavily accented
American English to get their messages across.
   ``We've always reproached the Americans for their superficiality,
their vulgarity, the McDonald's culture,'' Lammers said.
   ``But it has been enthusiastically embraced by the younger
generation, which likes the jeans, the chewing gum, the relaxed life
style as opposed to the rigidity of the old Dutch class system,'' he
said.
   But the love-hate attitude of the Dutch intelligentsia is most
acute in the field of U.S. foreign policy.
   ``I'm seething when American soldiers are flown to Panama if that
country's leaders aren't sufficiently servile, and I think the
U.S.A. should be thrown out of NATO,'' Dutch columnist Maaike Helder
recently wrote in the left-leaning Amsterdam newspaper De Volkskrant.
   ``But no. What would I be without the books of Faulkner, Twain,
Roth, Salinger, Bellow? Where would I be without Billie Holiday,
Louis Armstrong, and Prince?'' he added.
   ``American culture is more important to me than Dutch culture.''

<HEAD>President's Plan to Kill Cocaine at Source All But Dead</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's plan to combat cocaine at the
South American source is all but dead just months after its
inception, according to officials who cite turf battles among U.S.
agencies, poor planning and a lack of coordination.
   The plan to eradicate and intercept cocaine in Peru and Bolivia _
the world's main coca plant producers _ also suffered serious
setbacks because the two Andean nations are rife with corruption,
lack resources and face enormous economic and political problems,
the officials say. In Peru, the largest coca leaf grower, an
ambitious U.S. program has been halted because increasing guerrilla
activity threatened American personnel.
   South America was to be the battleground for stopping the cocaine
flow into the United States. Bush, in his presidential campaign,
called for an ``international strike force to hit back, quick and
hard and often at foreign drug operations'' to stop narcotics
production at the source.
   Most of the world's coca leaves, the source of cocaine, grow in
Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, a lush region at the foothills of the
Andes known as the ``cocaine cradle.'' The sprawling region is a
stronghold of leftist guerrillas known as Sendero Luminoso, or
Shining Path.
   U.S. efforts to operate in the region and set up Bush's strike
force were halted because of the security threat, said a spokeswoman
for the State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics
Matters. She spoke on condition she not be identified.
   Ground-level eradication, already inefficient because it is done
by hand, was slowed further. Aerial spraying, which would
effectively stop the plants' four harvests a year, is banned by
Bolivian law and repeatedly put off in Peru.
   Attempts by about a dozen agents of the Drug Enforcement
Administration to locate and destroy makeshift cocaine laboratories
and clandestine airstrips have been curtailed by the guerrilla
activity, forcing agents to move out of the region and ferry in by
helicopter for daytrips.
   With the strikeforce approach stalled, DEA agents are falling
back on long-standing programs of advising local authorities. They
continue to train Peruvian police while work goes on in the Upper
Huallaga Valley to shore up a helicopter base to offer enough
security against the guerrillas for American personnel to operate
full-time in the region.
   The work, according to a State Department official, includes
``everything from lighting and wires to clearing the area outside
the fence so you can see who's coming in.''
   At the same time, DEA agents will be undergoing a course tailored
for them by the U.S. Army later this month at Fort Benning, Ga.
Charles J. Gutensohn, chief of cocaine investigations for the DEA,
said in an interview that the training is primarily to teach the
agents to deal with Peru's jungle environment and the Maoist
guerrillas operating there.
   U.S. officials still disagree on where prime responsibility for
the South American drug mission should lie, with options ranging
from the DEA, whose primary role is law enforcement, to the U.S.
armed forces, which would go after the traffickers and growers using
counterinsurgency tactics.
   The CIA, noting the lack of definition, set up a Counter
Narcotics Center in April to ``combine operational and analytical
support to our country's fight against international drug
trafficking,'' says spokesman Bill Devine. He said the plan is to
unite the intelligence community _ the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National
Security Agency, the Customs Service and the DEA.
   Declining to elaborate on the mechanics of the CIA center, Devine
added: ``The whole idea is to prevent overlap, for everyone to read
from the same book.''
   Some officials say the CIA center is yet another layer of
bureaucracy. And a Senate aide who has traveled to the drug-growing
region says the CIA center could prove unworkable because the agency
routinely refuses to cooperate with other agencies because it
``doesn't give up its sources, doesn't want to see them in court.''
   Bush's drug czar, William Bennett, is to issue a report in
September to define the strategies for overseas and at home. A
National Security Council report on ``who does what'' is under way,
Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said.
   ``Some countries have approached us and asked for military and
economic assistance,'' Hamilton added, declining to name the
nations. ``Such requests are indeed under consideration.''
   An administration official who works closely with drug issues
said Peru expressed an interest in military training and upgrading
its equipment, mostly aged Soviet weaponry. But the official, who
refused to be further identified, said direct U.S. military
involvement of the kind reportedly being considered by the National
Security Council is ``effectively a dead issue'' because none of the
cocaine-producing countries will invite American troops.
   The idea of increased U.S. involvement or sending soldiers to
South America has generated strong opinions, with opponents citing
the possible loss of American lives and proponents arguing that a
direct role increases the chance of success.
   Gutensohn, the DEA's chief of cocaine investigations, opposes a
military role but endorses his agency's overseas involvement.
   ``The tactics are paramilitary; the mission is law enforcement.
When we get issued the badge you know it could happen,'' he said,
referring to the chances of being killed as a DEA agent. ``Upstairs
there are 35 badges of (dead) agents hanging on the wall.''
   But Arnold Trebach, president of the Drug Policy Foundation, a
liberal think tank, sees U.S. involvement in South America as futile.
   ``If we can't control marijuana growing in our own country, what
person would dare suggest we could control it in Peru, Bolivia?'' he
asked.

   On the eve of an important court hearing,
Paramount Communications Inc. said it would add interest to its
hostile $12.2 billion offer for Time Inc. if certain delays prevent
it from closing the deal.
   Paramount said it had amended its offer of $200 per share in cash
for all of Time's stock to provide an interest payment of 9 percent
annually if it is unable to close the deal within 60 days after Time
either agrees or is ordered to refrain from interfering with
Paramount's efforts to obtain needed cable regulatory approvals.
   A scheduled hearing today in Delaware Chancery Court could
determine whether Paramount can acquire Time or whether Time can

   A federal jury has convicted a Wall Street
brokerage of an insider trading-related charge in a 1986 stock deal
but acquitted the firm of charges in three other deals and cleared a
trader of all counts against him.
   The verdict Monday against Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. for dealings with
jailed inside trader Ivan F. Boesky's company was the first
conviction of a New York Stock Exchange-registered firm in the

   Xerox Corp. said its board had approved a
leveraged employee stock ownership plan for salaried employees and
the repurchase of roughly 11 percent of the company's common stock.
   Xerox said the employee stock ownership plan for 57,000 salaried
employees would be financed in part by forfeited merit raises and
the loss of company contributions to a 401(k) retirement plan.
   The company said Monday it will implement the plan by issuing

<HEAD>Brewers Won't Have to Sell Off Pubs After All, Government Decides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has decided that Britain's biggest
brewers won't have to sell off 22,000 pubs as had been recommended
as a way of fostering competition in the nation's mostly
brewer-owned taverns.
   Trade Secretary Lord Young announced measures Monday to encourage
competition in the supply of beer and other drinks, but they were
not as drastic as those recommended this year by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.
   Britain's brewers are allowed to own pubs and to require that
their tenants only buy beer and other drinks from the owner.
Industry critics have called on the government to force competition,
which would bring cheaper prices and wider choices for consumers.
   Lord Young said brewers would be allowed to own more than 2,000
pubs each but that they would have to keep at least half of those
above that limit as ``free houses,'' which can sell beer of their
choice.
   The commission recommended in March that no brewer should be
allowed to own more than 2,000 pubs. This would have meant that
Allied-Lyons PLC, Bass PLC, Elders IXL, Grand Metropolitan PLC,
Scottish and Newcastle PLC and Whitbread PLC would have had to sell
off 22,000 of their ``tied houses.''
   Britain has 82,000 pubs, a majority of which are tied. Tied
houses are either tenanted houses owned by brewers but rented to
tenants, or are managed houses, which are owned and operated by the
brewers.
   Young had said when the report was published that he was inclined
to accept the commission's recommendations. On Thursday, he met the
brewers to discuss the report.
   Young, speaking Monday in the House of Lords, said his decision
would add 11,030 free houses to the existing 15,000.
   ``These proposals should enable a major freeing of the market
without the compulsory divestment originally recommended by the
MMC,'' he said.
   Lawmaker Bryan Gould, the opposition Labor party's spokesman on
trade matters, condemned the measures as ``craven and complete
capitulation'' of government to the big brewers.
   The national Consumers Association said it was disappointed the
trade secretary didn't break up ``the big brewers' stranglehold over
the supply of beer.'' His compromise decision won't benefit
drinkers, it said.
   The Brewers' Society, which represents Britain's brewing
industry, said it was studying the decision.
   The tenants of the national brewers also are to be free to buy
ciders, wines and spirits as well soft drinks, and low alcohol and
non-alcoholic beer from any source, Young said.
   Young has said the commission's recommendation that tenants
should be allowed to offer a ``guest'' beer should only apply to the
national brewers.
   The trade department said the new rules would be put in place
following a 42-day consultation period, during which details of the
regulations would be finalized.
   Young doesn't plan to meet with brewing industry leaders again,
the department said.
   The brewers are to be given two years to implement the changes.
One year after that, the director general of fair trading is to
review the situation.
   Young said that the measures he had announced would involve
``significant structural changes to the market,'' and that it was
important to review whether they had had the effect of increasing
competition in the brewing industry.

   These are some of the Delaware court decisions
that have helped decide recent takeover battles:
   Polaroid Corp. vs. Shamrock Holdings Inc. _ On March 24, 1989,
the Delaware Supreme Court upheld a Chancery Court ruling allowing
Polaroid to proceed with a stock repurchase plan. Shamrock, unable
to gain enough shareholder support for its hostile bid, dropped its
$3.2 billion offer.
   Pillsbury vs. Grand Metropolitan PLC _ On Dec. 16, 1988, retired
Justice William Duffy, sitting on the Delaware Chancery Court,
blocked two key parts of Pillsbury's defense, its ``poison pill''
shareholder rights plan and the spinoff of its Burger King
subsidiary. Pillsbury agreed two days later to a $5.68 billion
buyout by Grand Met.
   Macmillan Inc. _ On July 14, 1988, Chancery Court Judge Jack B.
Jacobs blocked a restructuring Macmillan proposed as a defense
against an unwanted $1.9 billion bid from the Robert Bass Group.
Bass later dropped his bid after competing offers from Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. and British publisher Robert Maxwell were
launched.
   On Nov. 2, the Delaware Supreme Court blocked a merger agreement
between Macmillan and Kohlberg Kravis, calling the bidding process
tainted. The next day, the Macmillan board gave its support to the
Maxwell tender and Kohlberg Kravis dropped its bid.

<BYLINE>EEC Finance Ministers Set Timetable For Monetary Union</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic and finance ministers from the
12 Common Market nations have set a timetable for preparatory work
on the first stage of European monetary union.
   The officials also ruled out for the time being a realignment of
currencies within the European Monetary System as a way to address
trade imbalances among the 12 nations.
   According to French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy, the 12
ministers agreed Monday that preparatory work for the first stage of
Common Market monetary union should be completed by December.
   That would give member states six months to make the necessary
adjustments before the July 1, 1990 deadline for the beginning of
``stage one'' of monetary union.
   That phase, as agreed to by Common Market heads of state and
government in Madrid last month, will include the removal of
exchange controls, closer coordination of economic and monetary
policies, and the eventual adherence of all Common Market currencies
to the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System.
   Currently, Italy, France, and Spain still have exchange controls.
Britain, Portugal, and Greece do not participate in the exchange
rate mechanism, which limits fluctuations of Common Market
currencies against one another.
   In a session restricted to ministers and one aide each, the
officials also discussed a quarterly report by the European Economic
Community's executive commission on members' economies and agreed
that inflation was the most prominent threat to those economies.
   According to the report, prices in the 12-nation trade bloc rose
5.4 percent in the 12 months leading up to April, compared with a
3.2 percent increase in the 12 months to April 1988.
   The ministers, however, did not make any decisions on how to
address the issue.
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said after the
meeting that a Community-wide stance on inflation was not necessary.
The 12 nations ``are all pursuing very much the same policies'' to
curb inflation, ``so joint action is already being taken,'' he said.
   The policies center on a tighter money supply, Lawson added.

<HEAD>Xerox To Create ESOP Plan For Salaried Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. said its board had approved a
leveraged employee stock ownership plan for salaried employees and
the repurchase of roughly 11 percent of the company's common stock.
   Xerox said Monday the employee stock ownership plan for 57,000
salaried employees would be financed in part by forfeited merit
raises and the loss of company contributions to a 401(k) retirement
plan.
   The company said it will implement the plan by issuing $785
million worth of new series B convertible preferred stock and using
the proceeds to repurchase 11 million of its 103 million outstanding
common shares.
   The repurchase of common stock was to be accomplished through a
tender offer, details of which the company said it would reveal
Tuesday.
   David T. Kearns said the repurchase and the ESOP plan would
provide ``greater value'' for shareholders.
   ``By giving our employees a major stake in the company through
the ESOP, we are creating value by more closely aligning employee
objectives with shareholder objectives,'' Kearns said.
   The initial ESOP funding will come from bank loans, which will be
repaid over 15 years using three sources, Xerox said.
   The first source will be dividends on the preferred shares held
by the ESOP. The second will result from the elimination as of Jan.
1, 1990, of company contributions to a 401(k) plan for salaried
employees. The final segment will require use of a portion of the
1990 merit increase budget for U.S. employees.
   Company spokesman Thomas C. Abbott said most of the money for
repaying the loans will come from the preferred share dividends. But
he said he didn't have a detailed breakdown of how much each segment
would contribute to repayment of the loans.
   The plan affects the salaried employees of Xerox business
products and systems operations, Crumm and Forster Inc., Xerox
Credit Corp., and the headquarters staff of the corporation and
Xerox Financial Services.
   The employees won't have to use any of their own money from their
current salaries to finance the ESOP.
   The company also said it was willing to negotiate an ESOP for its
6,000 hourly workers represented by the Amalgamated Clothing and
Textile Workers Union. Abbott said the union raised the issue of an
ESOP during contract negotiations that were completed earlier this
year.
   The company also said it would negotiate an ESOP with other
unions representing another ``several hundred'' hourly workers.

<HEAD>CVN Agrees To Be Acquired By QVC in Video Shopping Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PLYMOUTH, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CVN Companies Inc. has agreed to be
acquired by the smaller QVC Network Inc. in a deal officials hope
will make the companies more competitive against Home Shopping
Network Inc. in the video shopping industry.
   The agreement, valued at more than $400 million in cash and
stock, is subject to approval by shareholders of both companies as
well as federal regulatory approval, the companies said Monday.
   ``The combination of QVC and CVN will allow for more effective
direct marketing efforts which will result in increased subscriber
acceptance and satisfaction,'' CVN Chairman Theodore Deikel said in
a statement. ``The combination will also enhance the opportunities
for long-term growth.''
   Joseph M. Segal, QVC's chairman, said his company would still
reach fewer homes with its CVN and QVC shopping programs than Home
Shopping Network does.
   But he said QVC would be able to compete more effectively and
``reach a sales level comparable to HSN's'' if the deal goes through
because the company would be able to offer consumers more
diversified shopping programs and merchandise choices.
   Tele-Communications Inc. of Englewood, Colo., CVN's largest
shareholder, made its own offer for CVN in November but withdrew the
bid in January.
   The video retailing industry generated an estimated $1.4 billion
in revenue last year.
   The merger agreement calls for QVC, of West Chester, Pa., to
purchase all CVN common stock for $19 a share in cash plus
one-eighth of a share in QVC common stock.
   CVN, which operates the Cable Value Network, the Fashion Channel
and America's Shopping Channel, had about 18.3 million shares of
stock outstanding, making that cash portion of the deal worth about
$350 million.
   The stock portion of the deal would add about $40 million to the
price of the transaction at recent prices.
   In national over-the-counter trading, CVN rose 75 cents a share
to $19.25 on Monday while QVC fell 62{ cents a share to $17.25.
   CVN also has warrants and options outstanding that would add $25
million to the value of the deal, the companies indicated.
   QVC, which operates the QVC cable network, has arranged for a
financing commitment of $435 million from the Bank of New York. It
has also received a commitment from Comcast Corp. to buy $30 million
of convertible subordinated debentures.
   QVC had net sales of $213 million in the year ended May 31,
substantially smaller than CVN's $637.8 million in the same period.
However, QVC has an exclusive TV agreement to sell Sears, Roebuck
merchandise.
   CVN reported serving some 23.3 million cable subscribers to 14.1
million for QVC.
   Home Shopping, which operates two shop from home networks, had
$730.1 million in sales in its latest fiscal year ended Aug. 31,
1988.
   The research firm Paul Kagan Associates Inc. of Carmel, Calif.,
estimated that Home Shopping's two channels combine for 55.79
million full-time-equivalent subscribers, a figure adjusted to
account for the fact that not all cable operators use the service 24
hours a day.
   On the same basis, Kagan estimates that CVN is second in the
industry with 21.04 million full-time-equivalent subscribers, and
QVC third with 10.95 million.
   CVN said its board decided that the QVC offer would benefit
shareholders more than CVN's previously announced plan to issue a
special $10 a share dividend. If CVN shareholders approve the
merger, the dividend will be canceled.
   After the merger, QVC said it intends to continue both companies'
television shopping programs.
   QVC said it does not intend to make any substantial changes in
CVN operations before the end of the year to allow time for teams
from both companies to evaluate ways to enhance productivity.

<HEAD>McCaw Lowers Bid for LIN Broadcasting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. has
lowered its bid for LIN Broadcasting Corp. by about $400 million,
citing a New York court decision that was unfavorable to LIN.
   The new offer, announced Monday, reduces to about $5.36 billion,
from $5.85 billion, the total value of McCaw's bid for the 90
percent of LIN shares it does not own.
   A spokesman for the New York-based LIN Broadcasting, wehich has
rejected the original bid as inadequate, said, ``We regard the McCaw
move as a cynical tactical manuever.''
   ``We continue to be excited by the prospects for LIN and will do
everything possible to protect the shareholders from the threat of
an abusive takeover,'' the LIN statement said.
   In late-afternooon trading in the over-the-counter market, LIN
was down $3.25 a share at $112 while McCaw was unchanged at $37.75 a
share.
   If successful, McCaw's takeover attempt would result in the
largest cellular telephone market in the country. The ``regional
supersystem'' that McCaw has been seeking would be more than twice
the market size of McCaw's closest competitors.
   McCaw said its new $110 per share offer will expire at midnight,
New York time, on July 21. The offer could be extended beyond that
date, McCaw said. All other terms and conditions of the offer remain
the same, it said.
   The two companies held discussions over the weekend about the
status of the previous $120 per share offer for all outstanding
shares of LIN common stock. The discussions did not result in any
agreement or understanding, McCaw said.
   To date, only a nominal number of shares have been tendered in
the offer, McCaw said.
   The New York Court of Appeals late last month denied LIN's claims
to certain cellular interests of Metromedia Co. in the New York City
and Philadelphia markets.
   Some analysts had estimated that if LIN had won the case, the
addition of the cellular interests could have added $40 a share to
LIN's stock price.
   In its statement, LIN confirmed that it had met with McCaw
officials last weekend at McCaw's request but that the talks were
inconclusive.
   ``Although nothing came of the discussions, it was clear from our
meeting that they valued LIN at higher than $120 per share. McCaw
has now had a more than ample opportunity to express itself and we
can focus on other opportunities,'' LIN said in its statement.
   McCaw first announced its bid to acquire LIN in early June.

<HEAD>First Conviction of a Wall Street Firm For Securities Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Wall Street brokerage convicted in the first
insider trading case involving an investment firm plans to ask a
federal judge to throw out the verdict because of an ``illogical''
split by a jury.
   Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. was convicted Monday in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan of conspiracy and securities fraud, but the jury
acquitted the firm of other charges and entirely cleared its chief
arbitrager.
   The conviction was the first against a New York Stock Exchange
member firm in the government's three-year Wall Street insider
trading crackdown. None of the charges involved trading on the Big
Board.
   Marcus Schloss was convicted of conspiracy in stock transactions
involving five companies in 1985 and 1986 and of securities fraud
for trading in the stock of American Brands Inc. in March 1986 using
illegally obtained inside information.
   The firm faces a total fine of $1 million. Sentencing was set for
September, on a date to be set later.
   But after a six-week trial and two weeks of deliberations, the
jury acquitted the firm of five other counts and acquitted D. Ronald
Yagoda, its head of arbitrage trading, on a total of nine counts.
   Marcus Schloss issued a statement saying it planned to ask the
district court to set aside the guilty verdict.
   ``To convict the firm on two of the seven counts against it, at
the same time Mr. Yagoda is acquitted, is illogical in the
extreme,'' the statement read.
   Marcus Schloss and Yagoda were acquitted of securities fraud in
connection with purchases of stock in Allegheny International Inc.,
Union Carbide Corp. and Avondale Mills, and of fraud in connection
with tender offers for the stocks of Union Carbide and Avondale
Mills.
   Yagoda also was acquitted of fraud stemming from purchases of
American Brands stock and of charges of perjury and obstruction of
justice in connection with the Securities and Exchange Commission's
investigation of the case.
   The conspiracy conviction against Marcus Schloss also included
charges of illegal stock trades in American Can Corp.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl H. Loewenson Jr. declined to comment
on the acquittals, stating that the jury ``convicted an important
stock trading firm of insider trading'' for the first time.
   Yagoda's attorney, Stanley Arkin, said he was ``delighted'' by
the acquittal. ``I think the government never should have brought
the case against him,'' he said. ``They had no credible evidence.''
   The trial was an outgrowth of the ``Yuppie Five'' insider trading
case that began in 1986. In that case, four young investment
professionals and a client of one of them confessed to stealing
secret information about takeovers and using it to profit in the
stock market.
   Marcus Schloss, Yagoda, another small brokerage and two other
individuals were indicted last November on the insider-trading
related charges for alleged deals between July 1985 and March 1986.
   The indictment accused the defendants of participating in an
insider trading ring with the Yuppie Five and an unidentified trader
at the now-defunct firm of jailed inside trader Ivan Boesky. The
ring included a former Marcus Schloss securities analyst, Andrew
Solomon, who pleaded guilty in 1986 to insider trading and
cooperated with the government.
   The defendants allegedly used non-public information to trade
profitabily in the stocks of the companies.
   U.S. District Judge Charles S. Haight Jr. earlier this year
separated the trials of the other defendants: Victor Teicher, his
firm Victor Teicher &amp; Co., and Ross S. Frankel, a former head of
arbitrage research at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. They are scheduled
for trial in January 1990.
   Yagoda also faces a separate civil trial in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan on charges involving the same four stocks he was
accused of illegally trading. Marcus Schloss last year agreed to pay
$410,700 to settle civil fraud charges with the SEC.

   New technologies being developed to burn coal
more cleanly could reduce pollutants from old power plants linked to
acid rain by nearly one-half, the Energy Department said.
   The department is in the early stages of a projected $5 billion
program with private industry to develop those ``clean coal''
technologies.
   The technologies are not expected to be ready for commercial use
before the turn of the century.
   The department said Monday that a draft analysis of the
environment effects of the new technologies concludes that they
could reduce national emissions of sulfur dioxide from existing coal
plants by as much as 45 percent by the year 2010.
   Nitrogen oxide emissions could be cut by as much as 33 percent
over the same period, it said.
   Both pollutants are precursors of the acids that form and fall as
acid rain when smokestack gases are carried long distances by the
wind.
   The analysis said clean coal technologies could result in a 5
percent to 12 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions when
used to refurbish older conventional power stations. Carbon dioxide,
an inevitable combustion product from any carbon-based fuel, is the
major gas responsible for the predicted ``greenhouse effect''
trapping of heat in the atmosphere and warming of the earth.
   While the air pollutants could be reduced, the Energy Department
study said the effects on solid waste were less clear. It said the
amount of solid waste generated could range from a 22 percent
reduction to a 23 percent increase.
   It did not explain the disparity in projected solid waste
generation, but said these wastes would be in a dry form that is
more easily handled than the wet sludge generated by the scrubbers
used to remove sulfur dioxide from smokestack gases of newer
coal-burning power plants.
   ``The commercialization of clean coal technologies would have a
substantial beneficial effect on air quality in the year 2010
compared to the no-action alternative,'' the study said.

<HEAD>Delta to Sell Shares to Swissair, Form ESOP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Delta Air Lines announced Monday that it has
entered into an agreement with Swissair to sell 2.5 million shares
of Delta common stock to the Swiss carrier for $193.3 million, or
about $77 a share.
   The agreement includes a reciprocal purchase by Delta of up to
100,000, or 5 percent, of Swissair's shares.
   Delta said the cross investments are intended to promote
cooperation between the two airlines. In March, the two carriers
announced cooperative marketing and operating agreements.
   Delta on Monday also announced the formation of an employee stock
ownership plan as part of its existing family savings plan.
   Under the plan, nearly 7 million shares of Delta preferred stock
were purchased for about $500 million, the company said. The shares
will be allocated to employees in lieu of existing cash
contributions to the plan, but they can be converted into common
stock shares worth $86.40 each.
   The preferred stock will pay 6 percent a year in dividends.
   ``We are pleased to enhance our Family Care Savings Plan with the
addition of the ESOP,'' said Ronald W. Allen, Delta's chairman and
chief executive officer. ``By more closely aligning the interests of
our personnel with those of our stockholders, the ESOP should also
enhance stockholder values.''

<TEXT>
   A mysterious, 18-mile-long oil slick sighted
near the Exxon Valdez and the discovery of huge slabs of steel
hanging from the crippled tanker will delay its entry into San Diego
Bay, the Coast Guard said Monday.
   ``Things have gotten complicated,'' said Coast Guard Cmdr. Jack
Scarborough.
   In other developments, tests showed no traces of drugs in the
captain and crew of a Uruguayan tanker that spilled more than
300,000 gallons of oil in the Delaware River two weeks ago, their
lawyer said in Philadelphia. In Providence, R.I., officials
downgraded their estimate of the amount of oil spilled when a tanker
ran aground off Newport.
   A Coast Guard inspection Monday revealed potential navigational
problems from pieces of steel partially torn loose during the
vessel's voyage from Alaska, where the Valdez was involved in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   The steel pieces were hanging 20 feet to 30 feet below the ship's
bottom and could drag in harbor shallows, Scarborough said.
   The Valdez arrived off San Diego late Sunday but must be
certified by the Coast Guard as environmentally safe before it's
allowed into San Diego Bay.
   The ship, which had been scheduled to enter the bay Tuesday, is
to be repaired at National Steel and Shipbuilding Co., where the
vessel was built in 1986.
   ``We have a couple of things to do,'' Scarborough said. ``We have
to make sure she's not leaking, and we have to get this excess
baggage removed.''
   An aircraft spotted an oil slick near the Valdez, which is about
30 miles off San Diego. But Coast Guard officials who boarded the
vessel Monday morning to inspect it found no signs of leakage from
the tanker, Scarborough said.
   ``One of the things we're looking for is to make sure there's no
oil coming from the'' Valdez, he said. ``The oil slick was close
enough to the ship where it could be the source.''
   The slick is a sheen 18 miles long and about a mile wide,
Scarborough said. ``It sounds like a huge amount of oil but it
really isn't. Certainly, it's enough to worry about,'' he said.
   The California Fish and Game Department also was trying to
determine whether the Valdez was the source of the slick, Coast
Guard officials said.
   Exxon Shipping Co. spokeswoman Carrie Chassin, speaking from
Thousand Oaks, Calif., said she was not sure when the Valdez would
be cleared to enter the harbor.
   The Valdez smashed into a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound
on March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude. Hundreds
of miles of coastline were stained and thousands of animals died in
the spill, and the cleanup is continuing.
   In Philadelphia, attorney Raymond Letulle said Monday the Coast
Guard received the negative drug test results by phone last week.
   The tests were performed June 25, the day after the tanker
accidently dropped anchor, causing it to run aground in the river,
Letulle said.
   In Providence, officials downgraded the amount of oil spilled
when a Greek tanker ran aground off Newport to one-fifth the
original estimate of 1.6 million gallons.
   Less than 300,000 gallons of No. 2 heating oil spilled from the
World Prodigy when it struck a reef off Benton Point on June 23,
said Gary Ott, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
official assigned to the Coast Guard in Boston.
   The Exxon Valdez, towed by two tug boats and accompanied by a
third tug and salavage ship, left Alaska on June 23 for the
2,500-mile journey to San Diego.
   About 42 million gallons of crude oil that remained on board
after the accident was transferred to other tankers.
   Before departing, the ship's crude oil tanks were washed to
eliminate residual cargo. The Valdez, however, is carrying fuel oil,
which will be needed when the ship comes into San Diego Bay on its
own power.
   The repairs are expected to cost $25 million and take nine months.

<HEAD>Partner Says Trades Were `100 Percent' Legal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princeton-Newport Partners LP engaged in a series
of securities trades in 1984 and 1985 to generate short-term capital
losses for tax purposes, but the deals were legal, the defunct
firm's chief partner says.
   Testifying in his own defense, Princeton-Newport former managing
partner James Sutton Regan also said he was unaware of a separate
stock deal involving Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. that the government
has included in the securities fraud and racketeering case.
   ``I did not commit a crime. I did not cheat on my taxes. I did
not engage in a conspiracy. I am totally, 100 percent innocent,''
Regan said Monday under questioning from his attorney, Theodore
Wells.
   The government was expected to cross-examine Regan today.
   Regan, one of six defendants in the case, testified that
Princeton-Newport engaged in a series of ``tax trades'' in 1984 and
1985 to generate short-term capital losses it could claim as tax
deductions. He said the trades were necessitated in part by changes
in federal laws.
   ``It was my belief that the transactions were entirely legal, 100
percent legal,'' he said.
   Regan, 47, speaking calmly and evenly as he explained various
complex tax arrangements, described deals in which Princeton-Newport
sold blocks of securities to other investment firms temporarily to
claim losses for tax purposes.
   The government alleges the deals were engineered to create false
long-term capital gains and short-term capital losses for
Princeton-Newport in violation of federal tax laws. The indictment
last year alleged millions of dollars in bogus tax losses.
   But Regan testified that he was aware of federal laws when he
ordered the firm to conduct so-called ``day trades'' in 1984 in
which it sold blocks of stock and bought them back the same day. He
said all the trades were recorded in the company's books.
   He said the transactions were subject to market fluctuation and
no prearranged buyback price had been set.
   The government alleges the trades were ``parking'' arrangements,
in which securities owned by one party are sold to another with an
agreement to repurchase, usually at a preset time and price. The
government maintains that such deals are illegal if designed to
skirt federal tax or disclosure laws.
   He said he told Princeton-Newport general partner Paul A. Berkman
to conduct other trades in early 1985 through Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Some of those trades involved asking Merrill and Drexel to hold
stock in various companies for at least 31 days before
Princeton-Newport could repurchase it, in accordance with federal
laws, he said.
   ``This kind of tax planning was common all the time,'' he said.
``People would do anything possible to avoid long-term losses,
anything legally possible.''
   Regan denied any involvement in a deal cited in the indictment
that former Drexel trader Bruce Lee Newberg told Princeton-Newport
to sell blocks of stock in C.O.M.B. Co. to try to manipulate its
share price downward in 1985.
   ``I had no knowledge of that transaction whatsoever,' he said.
   In addition to Regan, Berkman and Newberg, on trial are
Princeton-Newport general partners Charles Zarzecki and Jack Z.
Rabinowitz, and the firm's controller, Steven B. Smotrich.
   Princeton-Newport, a small securities firm with offices in
Princeton, N.J., and Newport Beach, Calif., went out of business
after the indictment was brought last August.

<HEAD>Wealthy Wal-Mart Founder Just Another Neighbor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER M. FULFORD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He's ranked as the richest man in the
nation by a leading business magazine, but to folks in Bentonville,
a town of about 8,700 people, Sam Walton is just another neighbor.
   ``He's just a part of the community,'' said Curt Loyd, executive
director of the Bentonville Chamber of Commerce. ``He's a neat
person. He calls Bentonville home, and that is special to us.''
   Walton, who prefers bird-hunting, tennis and opening new Wal-Mart
stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings, is again
shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the
world's top billionaires. According to Forbes magazine's July 24
edition, the Walton family's estimated worth is $8.7 billion, up
from its 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   ``He is unavailable,'' said Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle of the
silver-haired founder of the nation's third-largest retail chain,
based in Bentonville, about 150 miles northwest of Little Rock.
   Shinkle said he received about 10 calls from reporters Monday
morning, when the Forbes list appeared in newspapers. Shinkle said
news coverage about Walton ``usually sets off a press frenzy'' for
comments from him. But the 71-year-old businessman declined to
comment.
   ``He feels any attention to Sam Walton is to the individual and
he prefers attention to Sam Walton (the founder of) the company,''
Shinkle said.
   ``He very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings. It just
puts him in a position he doesn't want to be.''
   But Walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal
modesty. Just after the 1987 stock market crash, in which Walton's
family-owned chunk of Wal-Mart stock lost millions in value, he
quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another
topic that it was only paper. Walton then changed the subject.
   Walton was first listed by Forbes as the nation's richest man in
October 1985. Three years ago, Forbes also began listing the world's
wealthiest people. Walton made that listing as the richest American
every year since. This year he ranks third, behind two Japanese
businessmen.
   Shinkle said Walton stays busy visiting many of the more than
1,400 stores operated by the company he started as a single
five-and-dime at Rogers more than two decades ago. He is out of the
office up to four days a week, the spokesman said.
   ``He spends most of his time talking to associates and
customers,'' Shinkle said, ``and he always comes back with many
ideas from them.''
   Wal-Mart calls its sales help associates instead of employees.
   When Walton first made the Forbes list of richest Americans,
recalled Little Rock investment banker Warren Simpson, calls came in
from all over about the billionaire from the Ozarks.
   ``They wanted to know about the stock and the company,'' said
Simpson, who works for Stephens Inc. ``You'd think that he'd be
living in New York or LA, not Bentonville, Arkansas. But now people
just accept it.
   ``When it comes out now, it's just, `Yeah, he's still there,'''
Simpson said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo, Stocks Rebound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar edged up against the Japanese yen and the
key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange also rebounded in thin trading
today.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 70.75 points, or 0.21
percent, closing at 33,746.77. The index had fallen 27.95 points
Monday.
   The dollar closed at 139.62 yen, up 0.34 yen from Monday's
139.28-yen finish. It opened at 139.47 yen and ranged narrowly
between 139.47 yen and 139.78 yen. The dollar had declined 0.37 yen
on Monday.
   Ichiro Ikeda, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo, said trading
was quiet in the absence of fresh market-affecting news.
   He said the dollar rose today mainly because many New York
investors who had sold dollars earlier were buying them back in
position adjustments.
   Most Japanese market players remained on the sidelines to await
the release Friday of the U.S. wholesale price index, Ikeda added.
   ``Expectations that the United States will make a further move to
relax its monetary policy no longer are affecting the Tokyo market
because it has been expected for quite some time already,'' Ikeda
said.
   But lower U.S. interest rates could discourage dollar-buying, he
said.
   Following Friday's prime lending rate cut of 0.5 percentage point
by Southwest Bank, Chase Manhattan Bank also cut its rate Monday by
0.5 percentage point from 11 percent.
   On the stock market, trading was thin because most investors had
little buying incentive before the July 23 elections for half the
seats in Parliament's upper house, said Daiwa Securities dealer
Kenji Ishizuka.
   Analysts predict the governing Liberal Democratic Party will
suffer major losses, and investors expect such a defeat for the
pro-business party would push down stock prices.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 550 million shares,
up from Monday's 500 million. Among gainers were steel, securities
and bank issues.

<TEXT>
   The dollar firmed in lively trading today,
supported by short-covering that began the previous day when the
Federal Reserve let short-term interest rates slip only 1@4 point,
currency dealers in Europe said.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Most of the dollar's upward movement came on short-covering in
late U.S. trading Monday and in early Asian trading today, dealers
said.
   ``The Far East brought it up on a technical reaction to the fall
over the last few weeks,'' said a trader at a large U.S. bank in
Frankfurt.
   ``It had really come off over the last few weeks and this
correction was actually overdue.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.34 yen to a closing 139.62 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 139.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday's
rates, included: 1.8755 West German marks, up from 1.8575; 1.6150
Swiss francs, up from 1.5960; 6.3570 French francs, up from 6.3005;
2.1148 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0988; 1,363.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,354.50; 1.1905 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18835.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6263 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6410 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $380.75 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $381.75. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $381.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $381.35, down from $383.45 late
Monday.
   Bullion dealers said gold has been hurt by investors' interest in
a variety of other investment instruments, as well as by signs that
inflation is peaking or has peaked in some major economies such as
the United States.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.49 to close at a bid $381.78.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.23 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $5.21.

<HEAD>Brady Edging Away From Veto Threat on Democratic S&amp;L Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady is shying
away from his threat to recommend that a savings and loan bill be
vetoed if it includes a Democratic plan adding $44 billion to the
budget deficit.
   At a packed news conference on the eve of today's negotiations on
separate House and Senate S&amp;L bills, Brady reiterated his strong
opposition to the Democrats' plan.
   However, he ducked attempts to prod him into repeating a veto
threat he issued when Congress first began debating President Bush's
proposal to fund S&amp;L rescues. And, he said he has not yet discussed
the possibility of a veto with Bush.
   ``I don't expect to get to that point. When people concentrate on
this ... that plan will wind up where the Bush ... position has
suggested that it be,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, Brady said the Treasury Department has refined its
proposal on the Resolution Trust Corp., the new agency that will
close or rescue more than 500 failed S&amp;Ls and dispose of an
estimated $300 billion in bad loans and repossessed real estate.
   A Treasury Department outline obtained by The Associated Press
shows that the administration has agreed to broaden the power and
authority of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman, who has sought even more
independence for his agency than Treasury is proposing, said the
FDIC was reviewing the Treasury outline.
   ``At this point we're not expressing concern,'' he said.
   The Treasury proposal makes it clear that the FDIC will have
day-to-day authority over S&amp;L rescue operations, with the RTC
playing only an oversight role to ensure that taxpayers' money is
not wasted.
   However, the Treasury is declining to compromise with Seidman on
two key points. It insists that the RTC employ an independent
oversight and auditing staff of 50 to 100 people. And, it has
resisted Seidman's request for a seat on the RTC board.
   The S&amp;L bailout funding question has emerged as the biggest
difference that House and Senate negotiators must resolve over the
next several weeks. The Senate in April adopted the administration's
plan, while the House last month approved the Democratic version.
   Both plans evade the automatic budget cuts required by the
Gramm-Rudman deficit law, but Democrats contend theirs is more
honest because the deficit figure announced each year would include
S&amp;L spending.
   The Democrats' plan would swell the deficit by $44 billion over
three years, but they say their method is cheaper for taxpayers
because the money would be borrowed through Treasury at a lower
interest rate.
   The administration plan keeps S&amp;L spending out of the deficit by
borrowing it through a special quasi-private agency, but at a higher
interest rate.
   The administration argues its method would preserve budget
discipline because it is harder to duplicate for other spending
programs. Thus, it would keep interest rates lower throughout the
economy, it argues.
   Senate rules require either plan to pass by 60 votes, and Sen.
Phil Gramm, R-Texas, has said he has been pledged 41 GOP votes _
enough to block the Democratic plan.
   The House and Senate versions also disagree on how to handle M.
Danny Wall, the nation's top S&amp;L regulator. Wall's agency, the
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, would be wrapped into the Treasury
Department.
   House Banking Committee Chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
believes Wall was responsible for hiding the true magnitude of the
crisis from Congress last year and wants to force Wall to undergo
another confirmation by the Senate.
   However the Senate, prodded by Wall's longtime boss, Sen. Jake
Garn, R-Utah, would permit Wall to serve the two years left in his
term.

<HEAD>Brady Says US Satisfied With Allies' Economic Coordination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's treasury secretary says the
president will not offer any broad new initiatives to shore up
international economic coordination at the economic summit this week
in Paris.
   ``What we ought to take out of this summit is that the world
economy is doing well and the economic policy coordination process
is one that works,'' said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady.
   ``I don't think there needs to be too much added to the process
at this point in time,'' he said Monday.
   Bush, along with the leaders of Britain, France, Japan, West
Germany, Italy and Canada, will attend the economic summit of the
world's largest industrial democracies from Friday through Sunday.
   Brady, meeting with reporters before his own departure for the
summit, disputed contentions that the economic coordination process
had stalled.
   Many economists are worried the surge in the value of the dollar
that began in the spring will send America's trade deficit soaring
again as U.S. goods are priced out of overseas markets.
   But Brady said the dollar is now back where it stood when he last
met with finance ministers from the other summit countries in April
and the group expressed a desire to stabilize the U.S. currency's
value.
   To those who contend the coordination process is not working,
Brady pointed to the improvement in America's trade deficit, which
declined by 27 percent last year and has shown further improvement
this year.
   Brady said the administration hopes to get a commitment from the
other summit nations to support moves toward democracy in Communist
Eastern Europe.
   Bush on Monday pledged in a speech to the Polish parliament that
the United States would provide $100 million in assistance to that
country and would push for aid from other Western nations at the
Paris summit.
   The Polish trade union Solidarity has said $10 billion in aid was
needed to rescue the Polish economy, but Brady said that much
assistance would not be forthcoming.
   ``Countries always ask for an amount of money that would solve
their problems and the donor nations try to do the best they can,''
he said.

<HEAD>Greek Bank Sued for $1.5 Billion By Depositors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for depositors in a Greek bank raided
by federal authorities last month filed a lawsuit alleging the bank
bilked immigrant Greeks out of hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The class-action lawsuit, filed Monday in U.S. District Court,
seeks $1.5 billion in damages and restitution for thousands of Greek
depositors in the National Mortgage Bank of Greece.
   Attorney Constantine Kangles said the bank, which advertised in
Greek-language newspapers in the United States, promised customers
interest rates as high as 18 percent that would be paid in Greek
drachmas and would not be disclosed to U.S. authorities.
   He said about 300 people are behind the lawsuit, but their ranks
could swell to as many as 3,000. The $1.5 billion represents treble
damages based on an estimate of about $500 million in deposits, he
said.
   Barry Slotnick, a New York attorney representing the bank, did
not comment on the lawsuit in a statement issued through a spokesman
Monday.
   Slotnick instead urged depositors in the bank not to panic. He
said in the statement all U.S. representative offices of the bank
were being staffed and American depositors would have access to
their funds next week.
   The civil lawsuit against the bank and 14 of its officers came
less than a month after federal authorities raided seven bank
branches in Illinois, Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania,
seizing documents and arresting the officers.
   The bank is charged with illegally accepting more than $700
million in deposits from customers in the United States and sending
the money overseas to avoid taxes, according to a complaint filed in
U.S. District Court in New York.
   The National Mortgage Bank of Greece is a separate entity from
the National Bank of Greece, which also operates in the United
States. The National Bank of Greece owns about 47 percent of the
mortgage bank, according to federal authorities.
   The mortgage bank's branches were not legally authorized to

<HEAD>SEC Proposes Making Disclosure-Exempt Sales Easier</HEAD>

   After a trip back to the drawing board, the
Securities and Exchange Commission is again proposing a change in
rules that would make it easier for corporations to raise capital
through the private sale of securities.
   The commission voted unanimously 5-0 Monday to seek another round
of public comment on revisions to its controversial proposed rule
144a, which eliminates some restrictions on the resale of securities
offered privately.
   The SEC's proposed rule would create what it terms a ``safe
harbor'' from registration and disclosure rules for the resale of
privately offered securities to big institutional investors.
   Supporters of the proposed change said it would lower financing
costs for companies and would attract foreign companies to raise
capital in the United States.
   But critics claimed the rule change would increase the power of
large institutional investors, such as banks and insurance
companies, while cutting into the business of stock exchanges.
   Privately sold _ or placed _ securities, usually debt or equity
securities such as corporate bonds, are exempt from the SEC's public
disclosure requirements.
   Corporations now may offer their securities in private placements
to large investors without going through the time-consuming
disclosure and approval proceedings required for public offerings.
But investors who buy those disclosure-exempt, privately purchased
securities must retain ownership for at least two years before they
can be resold.
   That requirement has made privately placed securities
unattractive to many large investors.
   Rule 144a, first proposed by the SEC last October, would have
allowed the resale of such exempted _ or restricted _ securities
providing the investors were large institutional investors with
total assets of $100 million or more.
   In response to some of the 89 letters commenting on the proposal,
as well as a roundtable discussion in March with top officials from
major corporations and investment institutions, the SEC staff
recommended changes in the original proposal.
   Those changes included shifting requirements on investor size
from $100 million in total assets to $100 million in invested
securities ``as a better indication of sophistication as an
investor,'' said Linda Quinn, head of the SEC's Division of
Corporation Finance, in a prepared statement to the five commission
members.
   ``One hundred million dollars in total assets is a small bank,''
she said, adding ``that's quite a small bank.''
   Her division also recommended that the SEC ``implement Rule 144a
in stages'' starting with sales to ``qualified institutional
buyers'' with $100 million invested in securities.
   Also, the division recommended that sellers of disclosure-exempt
privately placed securities ``provide the buyer upon request, basic
information concerning the issuer.''
   The division said it expected to return to the commission members
with its final recommendation, after more public comment, early in
the fall.
   In other action, the SEC also proposed a rule change that would
allow some Canadian companies issuing securities to use Canadian
disclosure documents when registering in this country.
   That proposal was developed in cooperation with the Ontario
Securities Commission and the Commission des valeurs mobilieres du
Quebec.
   Of the 516 foreign issuers filing periodic reports with the SEC,
more than half are Canadian.
   As of June 19, there were 21 Canadian issuers listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, 38 on the American Stock Exchange and 146
quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotations system, according to the SEC.

<HEAD>Trump-Pratt Legal Battle Back In Court</HEAD>

   The ongoing legal battle between
Donald Trump and the Pratt Hotel Corp. over rights to develop the
abandoned Penthouse casino site is again focusing on whether the
billionaire developer owns too much property here.
   The latest chapter in the courtroom fight occurred Monday before
Superior Court Judge L. Anthony Gibson, who heard arguments on
whether his court or state gaming regulators should hear antitrust
complaints filed against Trump.
   In 1988, the Dallas-based Pratt Hotel Corp. announced plans to
build the Sands Hollywood casino at the Boardwalk site of the
defunct Penthouse casino project. But when Pratt's development
agreement expired in December, Trump stepped in and bought the site
for a luxury non-casino hotel.
   In April, Pratt sued Trump in Superior Court, asking the court to
void Trump's contract with Penthouse publisher Robert C. Guccione.
Among the complaints, Trump, Guccione and their corporate entitities
were charged with civil conspiracy, antitrust, fraud and engaging in
a pattern of racketeering activity.
   Monday's hearing focused on whether four counts in Pratt's
complaint against Trump _ which charge him with violating the New
Jersey Antitrust Act _ should be heard by the court or the state
Casino Control Commission.
   Gibson extended the hearing until July 18. But in 1{ hours, he
heard arguments from attorneys for Trump, Pratt and Penthouse.
   Penthouse attorney Paul A. Rowe argued that the Casino Control
Commission, in approving Trump's recent purchase of Elsinore's
Atlantic Casino Hotel, found that Trump has not created a monopoly
in Atlantic City.
   Because the casino commission has already explored the subject of
economic concentration, Gibson would only be duplicating efforts,
Rowe said.
   But Pratt attorney Arnold Calmann said, ``Trump and Penthouse are
arguing to the court that the Casino Control Act divests and
eliminates the jurisdiction of a New Jersey court to hear antitrust
claims brought under the New Jersey antitrust act. There is no law
to support that.''
   In 1978, Penthouse bought the Holiday Inn on the Boardwalk and
the Four Seasons Motel on Pacific Avenue and announced plans to link
the two to create a casino hotel.
   A steel superstructure was put in place to join the two
buildings, but construction stopped when Guccione ran out of money.
   Trump has said he intends to demolish the rusting framework, but
refurbish the Holiday Inn site into a non-casino hotel connected to
Trump Plaza. The back section of the Boardwalk property would become
parking space for now, he said, but a luxury hotel would eventually
be built on the site.

   A steady decline in interest rates should prompt
most major banks to follow Chase Manhattan Bank's lead in lowering
the prime rate again, economists predicted.
   Chase stood alone Monday in trimming its key lending rate a half
percentage point to 10.5 percent.
   ``I'm a little surprised that the other banks did not come in
with a similar decision,'' said Robert A. Brusca, chief financial
economist for Nikko Securities Co. International. ``I suspect some
key people who probably make these decisions are probably on
vacation.''
   But Brusca predicted others would soon follow suit this week,
even as early as today.
   The prime, which usually lags behind other interest rates, is the
rate banks charge customers with the best credit ratings. It also is
the benchmark rate used to set interest on a variety of consumer and
business credit, including home-equity lines of credit.
   It stood at 10.5 percent at the start of 1989. Banks raised it
twice in February to 11.5 percent, then lowered a half percentage
point on June 5. Those movements reflected changing concerns about
economic growth and inflation.
   Economists have been predicting another prime-rate drop as the
Federal Reserve Board shows more signs of loosening its credit
policies in response to a slowdown in economic growth and easing of
inflation.
   Last week, the federal funds rates, the market rate of which the
Fed has direct control, dipped as low as 8~ percent after hovering
at around 9{ percent. The federal funds rate is what banks charge
each other for overnight loans.
   Other credit market rates also have been falling steadily in
recent weeks. The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond, for instance,
has tumbled to about 8 percent, its lowest level in more than two
years. And 30-year fixed mortgage rates also have fallen, dropping
last week to an average 10.17 percent, a 14-month low, according to
HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J.-based mortgage reserach firm.
   Saving rates also have slipped, with the average yield on the
six-month certificate of deposit down to 8.79 percent last week from
from 8.84 percent the previous week.
   Bond and stock prices rose moderatly following Chase's
announcement Monday, while the dollar was little changed to slightly
lower.
   Chase said it lowered its prime rate because its cost of
borrowing money, including interest it pays on savings accounts or
CDs, had declined.
   Last week, one small bank, Southwest Bank in St. Louis, cut its
prime rate to 10.5 percent from 11 percent. But since then, no major
bank but Chase has taken similar action.
   Although it's not unusual for one or two banks to adjust their
prime rates without others immediately following, major banks have
essentially worked in harmony in recent years.
   For example, Citibank and Chase raised their prime to 7.75
percent from 7.5 percent on March 31, 1987, a day before other major
banks started following suit.
   The last time Chase went solo was on Dec. 28, 1983, when it
lowered the prime to 11 percent from 11.5 percent. Other banks took
similar action two weeks later.
   ``We made an independent judgement,'' Chase spokesman Fraser
Seitel said of Monday's move. ``What we base our decisions on as
much as anything else is the level of the cost of funds and market
rates, and at this particular level 10.5 percent is clearly the
appropriate rate.''
   While most economists predicted that interest rates would
continue to decline through early next year, some said the lower
rates would do little to spur the economy, other than give the
sagging housing market a lift.
   ``I see it as more of a way of preventing a recession than
boosting economic growth,'' said Carol A. Stone, a senior economist
Nomura Securities Inc. ``We've just been on a three-to-four year
buying surge and I think a lot of peole are saying, `I have my VCR
and my camcorder and other durable goods.' There's not a lot of pent
up demand here.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly lower
in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as showers and
cooler temperatures brought relief to heat-stressed crops in the

   The early slide in prices continued the trend set Monday, when
the corn and soybean markets sold off sharply on weather forecasts

   An investor group including financier Sir James
Goldsmith today launched a surprise 13 billion pound, or $21
billion, offer for BAT Industries PLC in what would be Britain's
biggest-ever takeover.
   BAT immediately rejected the bid, which if successful would put
British takeovers into the big league, second in size to last year's
record $25 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co.
   ``It is no more than an ill-conceived attempt at destructive
financial engineering,'' BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in
rejecting the offer.
   An investor group called Hoylake Investments PLC was formed
specifically to make the BAT bid. Among the investors in Hoylake,
which has been set up as a subsidiary of Anglo Group PLC, are
Oriental Investments Ltd., a company headed by Goldsmith.
   Other Hoylake investors include financiers Jacob Rothschild, a
Briton, and Australian Kerry Packer, owner of Consolidated Press
Holdings.
   Hoylake is offering 850 pence, or about $13.86, worth of
securities for each BAT share.
   Shares in the diversified British conglomerate, as well as in the
overall London stock market, rocketed on the news. BAT shares were
up 211 pence at 905 pence on heavy volume by late afternoon in
London.
   The offer for BAT is at a 22-percent premium over Monday's
closing price of 694 pence a share, Hoylake said in a statement.
   The investment group owns approximately 19.1 million BAT shares,
which is about 1.25 percent of the company's stock.
   Hoylake said it intended to restructure the company, including
selling Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles, which BAT
acquired for $5.2 billion in cash last year following a protracted
takeover battle.
   In addition to tobacco and financial services, BAT has interests
in retailing. It operates Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's
stores. Its cigarette brands include Kool, Viceroy and Barclay.
   Its principal subsidiary in the United States is Louisville,
Ky.-based Batus Inc.
   ``It is not an essential part of the case for the offer to
criticize BAT's managers nor the quality of the businesses
acquired,'' the announcement said. ``The principal criticism is
aimed at BAT's broad strategy. Hoylake considers it a mistake to
make BAT a conglomerate.''
   BAT had after-tax profit of 949 million pounds, or $1.55 billion,
on revenue of 17.7 billion pounds in its most recent fiscal year,
ended Dec. 31.
   Investors in Hoylake, a subsidiary of Anglo Group PLC, are
General Oriental Investments Ltd. a company headed by Goldsmith, one
of Britain's wealthiest investors, as well as subsidiaries of J.
Rothschilds Holdings PLC and of Consolidated Press Holdings, a
company owned by Packer.
   The biggest British takeover has been British conglomerate Hanson
PLC's recently accepted 3.5 billion-pound, or $5.7 billion, offer
for Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, the British gold mining group.

   Attorneys asked a Delaware judge today to
block Time Inc.'s attempt to acquire Warner Communications Inc. and
allow Time shareholders to vote on a takeover bid by hostile suitor
Paramount Communications Inc.
   In a hearing considered pivotal in the 5-week-old battle for
Time, attorneys for Paramount maintained the media giant put itself
up for sale when it agreed to a friendly merger with Warner earlier
this year, and as such should be forced to consider Paramount's
hostile $12.2 billion bid.
   Paramount attorney Melvyn L. Cantor told Chancery Court Judge
William T. Allen that Time's board knew in March when it agreed to
merge with Warner in a stock swap that the deal could put Time on
the auction block.
   Time subsequently changed the to a $14 billion tender offer for
Warner's stock and the companies exchanged stock in each other to
seal the deal.
   Cantor pointed to the exchange of stock as proof the companies
knew they were opening themselves up to possible third-party bids.
   Michael R. Klein, an attorney representing investor Robert M.
Bass and other major Time shareholders, made the same point.
   Klein said the stock exchange was ``done to defend the
transaction...it was understood that the market reaction might be to
perceive that both Time and Warner were up for grabs.''
   Both attorneys asked that Time shareholders be allowed to vote on
the $200 a share Paramount offer. Time has proposed to complete the
offer for Warner without a shareholder vote.
   Time's attorney's, scheduled to present their case after a lunch
break, were expected to argue that its board never contemplated
selling the company and that the agreement with Warner stemmed from
the ordinary conduct of Time's business.
   Nearly 200 people crowded into the Chancery Court for the hearing
before Judge William T. Allen. Absent were most top executives from
the companies.
   Allen's ruling, which is not expected until later this week,
could affect more than just these three companies since many of the
biggest U.S. corporations are incorporated in Delaware and subject
to its laws and court rulings.
   On the eve of the hearing, Time stock rose $1.12{ to close at
$152.62{ a share Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Warner stock
rose 25 cents to $62 a share and Paramount dipped 25 cents to $56.75
a share.
   Time fell $2.62{ a share to $150 in early-afternoon trading
today, while Warner lost 25 cents to $61.75 and Paramount rose 50
cents to $57.50.
   Also Monday, Paramount said it had amended its $200-per-share
offer for Time to add interest under certain conditions.
   Paramount said it would add interest at a rate of 9 percent a
year if the deal were not completed within 60 days after Time either
agrees to the deal or is ordered to refrain from interfering with
Paramount's efforts to obtain government approval to transfer Time's
cable television licenses.
   ``Our willingness to pay interest if the company cannot close its
deal within 60 days underscores our confidence that regulatory
approvals can be obtained within that period if Time's
obstructionist tactics are stopped,'' said Donald Oresman,
Paramount's general counsel.
   Time offered no comment on the new terms, but a source close to
Time, speaking on condition he not be identified, said Paramount's
interest offer ``represents a belated admission that it will take
Paramount a substantial period of time to obtain the necessary
regulatory approvals.''
   Time has rejected Paramount's bid as inadequate and highly
conditional, saying it could take a year or more for Paramount to
secure the needed regulatory approvals for cable license transfers.
   Paramount has said it could win the necessary approvals within a
few months, but has complained that Time has been drumming up
opposition among local cable regulators to Paramount's efforts.
   The issue in today's court hearing, according to Duke University
Law School professor James D. Cox, is whether entering into
negotiations with Warner ``triggers the auctioneer role for the
(Time) directors, or can their conduct merely be judged by the
business judgment rule.''
   The business judgment rule, a widely-followed legal concept,
allows decisions made by directors in the normal course of business
to stand. Courts generally are reluctant to disturb such decisions.
   Time Chairman J. Richard Munro hinted that the company was
considering a merger when he told securities analysts last November
that Time intended to be among the growing ranks of global media
conglomerates.
   Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis has indicated he raised the
possibility of a merger between Paramount and Time ``on several
occasions during the past several years.''
   That raises the question of whether Time entered into the merger
agreement as a defensive step. If that were the case, Time would be
forced to consider buyout offers.

   Stock prices soared Tuesday following an unexpected
$21 billion takeover bid for the conglomerate BAT Industries PLC.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 55.7
points, or 2.5 percent, higher at 2,250.9.
   Earlier in the afternoon, the closely watched index hit a
post-crash high of 2,260.8. At its lowest, prior to the bid for BAT,
the index was down 7.5 points at 2,187.7.
   Volume totaled 639.3 million shares, up sharply from 417.6
million Monday.
   The bid by an investor group including Anglo-French financier Sir
James Goldsmith, British financier Jacob Rothschild and Australia's
Kerry Packer was quickly rejected by BAT which said it was of
``dubious value.''
   Nonetheless, it inspired the market.
   ``The BAT bid was very important,'' said Kenneth Inglis, equity
strategist at UBS Phillips and Drew. ``We're likely to see similar
takeover attempts in the near future.''
   The market's leap forward prompted many equity analysts at London
brokerages to forecast further robust gains in the market during the
third quarter. Continuing takeover speculation, high institutional
liquidity, and a lack of selling pressure are seen leading the
market higher in the near term.
   The market received additional upward impetus from a robust
showing on Wall Street. At the London close, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average was up 17.64 points at 2,520.30 points.
   ``Today's bid now suggests that no U.K. company is immune from a
potential takeover,'' one equity trader noted.
   If successful, a BAT takeover would put British takeovers into
the big league, nearing last year's $25 billion buyout of RJR
Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., the largest company
purchase ever.

<UNK>Marriott Sells Airline Catering Unit to Investor Group</UNK>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marriott Corp. announced Tuesday that it has
agreed to sell its airline catering business to an investor group
that includes members of the unit's senior management.
   The purchase price was not disclosed, but analysts have estimated
that the business would fetch $550 million to $700 million. The
business will retain its current name, Marriott In-Flite Services.
   Proceeds from the sale, which is expected to be closed before the
end of the year, will be used to pay debts, the hotel giant said in
a news release.
   The investor group, called Caterair International, is led by
Daniel J. Altobello, an executive vice president of Marriott Corp.;
Frederic V. Malek, a Washington banker and former Marriott
executive; and several members of Marriott In-Flite Services' senior
management.
   Carlyle Group, a Washington investment firm which includes former
defense secretary Frank Carlucci, is acting as financial advisor to
the investor group.
   Marriott said In-Flite Services is the world's leading provider
of airline meals, serving 150 airlines through 108 flight kitchens
at 45 U.S. and 38 foreign airports. The business, with nearly 19,000
employees worldwide, had revenue of around $800 million in 1988.
   ``The airline catering division is a sound, profitable
business,'' Marriott said in a statement. ``However, the division's
role as a supplier of food products and services for airlines is not
compatible with Marriott's long-term strategy of focusing on high
potential growth markets in lodging, food and related services
provided directly to consumers.''

<DATELINE>PURCHASE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Paper said Tuesday its
second-quarter earnings rose 22 percent from a year ago, due to
strong sales and acquisitions.
   For the three months ended June 30, International Paper's
earnings totaled $229 million, or $2.04 a share, compared with $188
million, or $1.64 a share, in the comparable 1988 quarter.
   Revenue jumped 25 percent to $3 billion from $2.4 billion.
   Chairman John A. Georges said the latest quarterly results
reflected several new acquisitions, including the French paper
company, Aussedat Rey.
   ``The strong performances of these businesses compensated for a
softening in the uncoated white papers markets,'' Georges said.
   He also attributed the results to the company's strong businesses
in pulp, paperboard and packaging.
   The company further announced authorization of an additional
purchase of 4 million shares of common stock, which it said would be
used in connection with employee benefit plans and general corporate
purposes. The announcement expanded a previously disclosed
repurchase authorization to 5.8 million shares.
   The company has more than 100 million shares outstanding.
   For the first half of 1989, earnings were up 30 percent to $452
million, or $4 a share, compared with $347 million, or $3.02 a
share, in the year-earlier period.
   Sales totaled $5.6 billion vs. $4.7 billion, up 19 percent.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Europe, Gold Falls In Quiet Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar rose in choppy European trading
Tuesday. Gold prices fell.
   Dealers said the dollar was boosted largely by internal market
influences. But it also got a lift, they said, from comments by the
West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl that the
dollar-mark rate was now at a level he viewed as ``welcome.''
   European dealers said interest was concentrated largely in the
trading of the mark against Britain's pound sterling and the
Japanese yen.
   ``We tend to think that it's not been so much a dollar play as a
lot of cross trading that at times has made the dollar look
strong,'' said a senior dealer at a U.S. bank in London.
   A dealer with a major West German bank in Frankfurt said until
Friday, when new U.S. economic data is due, the market doesn't
expect any substantial moves. The U.S. producer price index,
industrial production, retail sales and capacity utilization figures
for June are scheduled for release on Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.34 yen to a closing 139.62 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted higher at 140.25 yen.
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.6270 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6410 dollars late Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.8795 West German marks, up from 1.8575; 1.6160 Swiss francs, up
from 1.5960; 6.3740 French francs, up from 6.3005; 2.1180 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.0988; 1,364.50 Italian lire, up from 1,354.50;
and 1.19025 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18835.
   Gold eased in London to a late bid price of $380.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $381.75.
   In Zurich, gold fell to $379.75 an ounce from $383.45 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.49 to close at a bid $381.78
an ounce.
   Silver bullion prices rose in London to $5.27 a troy ounce from
Monday's $5.21.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Tumble Again On Rainy Weather</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed sharply
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, tumbling for the second
straight day in response to improved crop-growing conditions.
   Analysts said morning showers in downtown Chicago probably
prompted even more selling than the National Weather Service's
latest six-to-10-day outlook, which predicted normal rainfall and
sub-normal temperatures in the Midwestern Corn Belt from Sunday
through Thursday, July 20.
   The condition of the U.S. corn and soybean crops deteriorated
slightly in the past week due to lack of moisture, according to the
Agriculture Department's weekly crop progress report.
   The USDA listed 6 percent of the corn crop in poor or very poor
condition as of Sunday compared with 3 percent in the previous week.
   The agency ranked 9 percent of the soybean crop poor or very poor
as of Sunday compared with 6 percent a week earlier.
   At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 8 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.91{ a bushel; corn was { cent to
5{ cents lower with July at $2.58{ a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to
2} cents lower with July at $1.44\ a bushel; soybeans were 18} cents

   Stock prices moved higher today as the market
extended its advance for a sixth straight session.
   Optimism about the outlook for further interest rate declines has
set a positive tone on Wall Street while interest in buying stocks
considered takeover candidates also has contributed to bullish
sentiment.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said activity in the bond market appeared to have a direct impact on
stocks today.
   Stock traders became enthusiastic about buying when the yield on
the widely watched 30-year Treasury bond temporarily dropped below 8
percent for the first time since the spring of 1987.
   When the key bond's yield bounced back above 8 percent, stock
traders took it as a cue to sell and collect some profits, said
Johnson.
   ``Probably the No.1 feature today was the assault that the bond
market made on the 8 percent yield,'' he said. ``It hit a lot more
resistance, or selling of bonds, than most people expected, which
was a touch demoralizing for the bond market.''
   ``When it started to back off from that 8 percent wall, the stock
market saw that occur and started some measured profit-taking,''
Johnson added.
   Meanwhile, the market appeared to get a lift from wordof a
surprise $21 billion bid for Britain's BAT Industries. BAT, a big
conglomerate with numerous American holdings, immediately rejected
the bid and analysts said a higher one might be forthcoming.

   Oil futures prices rose Tuesday, partly
recovering from losses in the previous session.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the August contract for West
Texas Intermediate rose 17 cents to finish at $20.53 a barrel. The
benchmark U.S. crude grade fell 39 cents on Monday.
   Other contract months also rose.
   Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange showed
across-the-board gains. The August contract for home heating oil
jumped 0.49 cent to close at 49.28 cents a gallon after falling 0.98
cent in the previous session.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for August delivery rose 0.16 cent to
56.62 cents a gallon, after declining 0.13 cent on Monday.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc. said buying was relatively light as traders anticipated
inventory statistics from the American Petroleum Institute.
   ``There were no features in today's market,'' Beutel said.
``People are waiting for the numbers.''
   Beutel said the latest weekly API figures could indicate
significant changes in supply and demand. U.S. refineries are
operating at 91.2 percent, the highest capacity since August 1980,
he said.
   Some analysts had predicted that a surge in summer gasoline
demand could eventually strain U.S. refineries and push prices
closer to the highs reached earlier in the season.
   Energy futures prices also have fluctuated in recent days in
response to labor problems affecting North Sea oil operations.

   The dollar ended higher Tuesday against key
foreign currencies after major banks again failed to follow Chase
Manhattan Bank's cut in the prime lending rate.
   Gold prices eased. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold
bullion for current delivery fell $3.10 to $381.50 a troy ounce.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$379 an ounce, down from $382.50 Monday.
   Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer at the New York office of Banco di
Sicilia, said the fact that other big U.S. banks didn't trim their
prime a half percentage point to 10.5 percent, as Chase did on
Monday, indicated that interest rates weren't falling as rapidly as
previously thought.
   Economists said many banks probably were awaiting further signs
that the Federal Reserve was loosening credit policies in reaction
to an economic slowdown before they lowered their prime.
   ``The Fed seems to be easing (credit) extremely cautiously,''
Glamuzina said.
   Currency dealers said a spate of economic data due out Friday
should shed further light on the economy's direction. The government
is set to release the producer price index, industrial production,
retail sales and capacity utilization figures for June.
   Also helping the dollar Tuesday was an increase in trading of the
mark against Britain's pound sterling and the Japanese yen.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.34 yen to 139.62 yen. It was quoted at 140.25 yen
in London, and at 140.75 yen in New York, up from 139.20 yen Monday.
   The dollar was stronger against the British pound. It cost
$1.6270 to buy one pound in London, cheaper than $1.6410 late
Monday. Sterling fetched $1.6235 in New York, down from $1.6390.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday,
included: 1.8835 West German marks, up from 1.8638; 1.6190 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6015; 6.3840 French francs, up from 6.3155;
1.19055 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18925; and 1,365.025 Italian
lire, up from 1,354.50.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, vs. Monday: 1.8795 marks, up from
1.8575; 1.6160 Swiss francs, up from 1.5960; 6.3740 French francs,
up from 6.3005; 2.1180 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0988; 1.19025
Canadian dollars, up from 1.18835; and 1,364.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,354.50.
   Gold eased in London to a late bid price of $380.25 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $381.75. In Zurich, it fell to $379.75
an ounce from $383.45 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.49 to close at a bid $381.78
an ounce.
   Silver prices gained.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $5.257 a troy ounce, up 2.8 cents from Monday. Silver rose in
London to $5.27 an ounce from $5.21.

   Stock prices climbed higher Tuesday as the market
extended its advance for a sixth straight session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished with a gain of
11.95 at 2,514.61, which was significantly lower than its best level
of the day.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 926 up, 579 down and
500 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 171.59 million
shares, up from 131.87 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 209.10 million shares.
   Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.,
said activity in the bond market had a direct bearing on the stock
market's movements.
   Stock traders became enthusiastic about buying in the early going
when the yield on the widely watched 30-year Treasury bond
temporarily dropped below 8 percent for the first time since the
spring of 1987.
   When the key bond's yield bounced back above 8 percent, stock
traders took it as a cue to sell and collect some profits, said
Johnson.
   ``Probably the No.1 feature today was the assault that the bond
market made on the 8 percent yield,'' he said. ``It hit a lot more
resistance, or selling of bonds, than most people expected, which
was a touch demoralizing for the bond market.''
   ``When it started to back off from that 8 percent wall, the stock
market saw that occur and started some measured profit-taking,''
Johnson added.
   The market got some help in prolonging its winning streak from a
surprise $21 billion bid for tobacco giant BAT Industries.
   BAT, a big British conglomerate with numerous American holdings,
quickly turned down the proposal and analysts said a higher one
could be forthcoming. The hostile offer from financiers Sir James
Goldsmith, Jacob Rothschild and Kerry Packer, was worth about $13.86
in debt securities per BAT share.
   Stock of BAT was the most heavily traded issue on the American
Stock Exchange, with volume of more than 7 million shares. BAT rose
215-16 to 14].
   The surge in BAT ignited a rally in other tobacco stocks. Philip
Morris rose 2[ to 143} and American Brands went up 1{ to 71].
   Besides Philip Morris, another gainer among the blue chips
included International Paper, up } to 47\, which announced improved
second-quarter income.
   UAL, recently pushed aloft by takeover talk, pulled back by 2~ to
165|. Flight attendants of UAL's United Airlines have voted to
authorize a strike. But the negotiations between the union and
United are under the supervision of a federal mediator who would
have to declare an impasse and call for a 30-day cooling-off period
before a strike could be called.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $15.32 billion, or 0.48

<HEAD>Pork Belly Futures Plunge; Glut Persists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Frozen pork belly futures sank below 30 cents a pound Tuesday on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange amid renewed concern about the glut
of bellies clogging the nation's commercial freezers.
   Hog futures also retreated while cattle futures rose.
   On other markets, grains and soybeans were sharply lower; energy
futures advanced and precious metals were mixed.
   Frozen pork bellies settled .43 cent to 1.80 cents lower with the
contract for delivery this month at 28.97 cents a pound, matching
the nine-year low reached May 31.
   The trading reflected expectations that a weekly exchange report
would show no significant decline in the amount of pork bellies in
cold storage outside of Chicago.
   The report, issued after the close, showed an unexpectedly large
drawdown of 4.6 million pounds, which analysts said could prompt
some buying of futures on Wednesday.
   But frozen stocks of bellies, which are cured and sliced to make
bacon, still are believed to be at near-record levels as the end of
the heaviest usage period approaches.
   Charles Levitt, chief livestock market analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc., said he expects the Agriculture Department's
July 21 cold-storage report to show about 128 million pounds of
frozen bellies on hand as of July 1, which would be the
second-highest total on record for that date and 1{ times the
10-year average.
   The July 1 record high was 133.2 million pounds in 1964.
   Levitt said traders fear there will be little significant
drawdown in frozen stocks by fall, when hog slaughters typically
increase and fresh bellies grow more abundant.
   ``This is the time of year we're supposed to be taking the chunk
of bellies out of storage and using them in consumer channels,''
Levitt said.
   ``If you get into the fall and start the seasonal increase in
slaughters again, what are you going to do if you've got a lot of
bellies still left in storage? They'll be worthless or near
worthless.''
   Hog futures prices fell in spillover selling from the belly pit,
while cattle futures advanced on expectations for dwindling supplies
this fall.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .65 cent higher with August at
70.15 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .60 cent higher
with August at 81.47 cents a pound; hogs were .50 cent to 1 cent
lower with July at 46.87 cents a pound.
   Corn and soybean futures fell sharply for the second straight day
on the Chicago Board of Trade as showers relieved crop-withering
heat and dryness in the Midwest. Wheat and oat futures also declined.
   Analysts said a morning downpour in downtown Chicago may have
steepened the sell-off, which was linked initially to Monday's
National Weather Service six-to-10-day outlook calling for normal
rainfall and sub-normal temperatures in the Corn Belt from Sunday
through July 20.
   Wheat settled 2 cents to 7} cents lower with July at $3.91} a
bushel; corn was { cent to 4{ cents lower with July at $2.59 a
bushel; oats were 2{ cents to 2} cents lower with July at $1.44\ a
bushel; soybeans were 17} cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at
$7.26 a bushel.
   Oil futures prices rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
partly recovering from losses in the previous session.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents to 17 cents
higher with August at $20.53 a barrel; heating oil was .40 cent to
.55 cent higher with August at 49.28 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .16 cent to .55 cent higher with August at 56.62 cents
a gallon.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $3.20 to $3.40
lower with August at $383.30 a troy ounce; silver was 0.7 cents to
2.8 cents higher with July at $5.257 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>NET to Pack an Answering Machine Into Regional Telephones</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England Telephone is readying a new answering
service it hopes will captivate the market, rendering personal
answering machines obsolete, but one machine manufacturer says the
industry won't suffer greatly.
   The service, which is being tested and introduced by the American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. spinoff throughout the country, enables
subscribers to use only their telephones to answer, record and hold
their calls, with the telephone company storing all messages.
   Subscribers can leave recorded greetings on the central system
and retrieve messages by punching into their touch-tone phone a
seven digit phone number, followed by a personal code of between
four and 10 digits.
   Because voice messaging can forward calls to be recorded if a
subscriber's line is busy, company officials say they expect the new
service will eliminate the need for answering machines, which do not
have that capability.
   ``That's my wish. Answering services will never become obsolete,
because some customers need and desire the personal touch we can't
provide, but yes, this could make machines completely obsolete,''
Anne Kemerer, a product manager for New England Telephone, said
Tuesday.
   Services employ personal operators to take calls, who can then
relay different messages to certain callers.
   A leading manufacturer of answering machines said it was unlikely
they would be edged out by a voice messaging service.
   ``We feel people don't want their messages kept in a big computer
downtown. Issues of privacy, cost and complexity are viable enough
so that it's not going to be an overwhelming threat to the
industry,'' said Jim Oblak, who is the director of marketing for
PhoneMate Inc.
   ``Yes it will take a certain amount of our business away, but
that will be small, with nowhere near the ramifications of kicking
us out of the business,'' he said.
   New England Telephone estimates that one-third of its residential
and business customers own answering machines.
   Kemerer also said that voice messaging was just the beginning of
a host of expanded services planned by the company.
   Jim Stork, a telecommunications industry analyst for the Chicago
consulting firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., said the advent of digital
networks had enabled ventures such as voice messaging, and predicted
an onslaught of new services from telephone companies.
   Voice mail is not subject to the strict rate regulation of
regular telephone services, and New England Telephone can charge
whatever subscribers will pay.
   The service costs $6 per month for residential customers, with a
one-time activation charge of $12.37. Business subscribers will pay
$18.43 up front and $12 a month thereafter.

   Union pilots of Northwest Airlines will meet
with Alfred Checchi on Wednesday to review details of his group's
proposed $4 billion takeover of the carrier's parent, a union
spokesman said Tuesday.
   The pilots, the only labor group at Northwest without a contract,
are dismayed with the debt that would be imposed on the company
under the proposed deal, which is subject to shareholder and
government approval.
   Financial advisers to the 5,000-member Air Line Pilots
Association have said they favor a proposed recapitalization of the
airline drafted by management as a backup to Checchi's $121-a-share
tender offer. The backup plan would involve less borrowing and a
lower payment to shareholders.
   ``We'll give him a chance to raise our comfort level on this,''
pilots' union spokesman Andy Murphy said of the meeting, to be held
in New York.
   Meanwhile, contract negotiations between the pilots and Northwest
resumed Tuesday for the first time since NWA Inc.'s board of
directors accepted Checchi's offer in mid-June.
   The mediated session began about 1 p.m. at NWA's Eagan
headquarters. The talks will be extended on a day-by-day basis,
Murphy said.
   The two sides have been negotiating for more than two years over
wages and benefits in the aftermath of NWA's acquisition of Republic
Airlines in the fall of 1986. The process is complicated by the need
to bring pilots of the airlines under the same agreement.

   Digital Equipment Corp. introduced a wide range of
new computers Tuesday, including several based on reduced
instruction set computing technology rather than Digital's
traditional VAX design.
   The new products are aimed at strengthening Digital in the market
for powerful workstations used by engineers, scientists and
designers. Digital is the nation's second largest computer maker
behind International Business Machines Corp.
   Reduced instruction set computing, or RISC, simplifies the
circuitry of a computer's central processor and offers cost savings.
But it is a new thrust for Digital, which until this year built all
its machines around its proprietary VAX architecture.
   Among the Maynard-based company's new offerings is its DECstation
2100, a workstation using a RISC microprocessor made by MIPS
Computer Co. of Sunnyvale, Calif., and the Unix operating system
developed by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
   Digital said the machine, with a price tag starting at $7,950, is
the industry's lowest-priced color, RISC-based, Unix workstation.
   Digital also announced several new entries in its VAX line, led
by the VAX 6400, which it said is up to 85 percent more powerful
than its previous high-end machine, the VAX 8840.
   A new version of the VMS operating system software for VAX
machines was also introduced. Digital said it would more than double
the number of computers that can be clustered in a VAX network, from
42 to 96.

   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. said Tuesday its
second-quarter profit slipped 2.3 percent despite a 5.8 percent rise
in revenue.
   The company, which publishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's
magazine as well as providing financial information services, said
it earned $48.4 million, or 48 cents per share, in the three months
ended June 30 compared with $49.5 million, or 51 cents a share, a
year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose to $437.7 million from $413.8 million
a year earlier.
   The company said operating income fell 8.8 percent to $35.0
million in its business publications segment as revenue edged up 0.1
percent, reflecting a slump in financial advertising. Ad linage at
the Journal was off 5.7 percent in the quarter and 16.7 percent at
Barron's.
   Operating income at the information services segment, which
includes its 67-percent owned Telerate Inc., rose 7.1 percent in the
quarter to $58.8 million on a 14 percent increase in revenue.
   For the first six months of the year, Dow Jones said its profit
rose 62.2 percent to $248.4 million, or $2.47 a share, from $153.1
million, or $1.59 a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose 4.7 percent to $844.5 million from $806.4
million a year earlier.
   The latest first-half results included an after-tax gain of
$164.1 million from the January sale of the company's holdings in
Continental Cablevision Inc.
   The first-half results a year ago included an after-tax gain of
$64.5 million from the sale of a book publishing subsidiary.

<HEAD>Study: High Returns from Junk Bonds in Recession Offset Losses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study of the performance of junk bonds in
a recession, released Tuesday, concludes that while some bonds would
default, high returns from the remainder would offset any losses.
   ``It showed that the argument that the next recession will spell
doom for high-yield bond issuers and investors is a red herring,''
said David Wyss, senior financial economist for DRI@McGraw-Hill, a
Lexington, Mass., business forecasting firm that conducted the study.
   The study of 573 high-yield bond issuing companies was
commissioned by the Alliance for Capital Access, a junk-bond trade
association here. It assumes a well-diversified portfolio of
high-yield securities held from 1988 to 1993.
   Junk bonds, often used to finance corporate takeovers, are
riskier than investment-grade corporate bonds, but are designed to
compensate investors for more frequent defaults by paying higher
interest rates. They've become popular only since the start of the
current economic expansion and critics say they would fare poorly in
a recession.
   The study used four negative economic scenarios including the
so-called ``soft-landing'' _ slower but continued growth _ currently
being sought by the Federal Reserve as it attempts to contain
inflation.
   The other scenarios were small and big recessions and a deep
recession accompanied by inflation such as occurred in 1981-82.
   In each instance, the study said, high-yield bonds would produce
returns superior to those of medium-term Treasury bonds,
mortgage-backed securities and investment-grade bonds even after
defaults are taken into account.
   The study found that the default rate for high-yield bonds in
each case would rise, ``though not significantly.''
   `What we also find is that the current yields of junk bonds are
attractive enough to offset the risk of default,'' Wyss said at a
news conference.
   The study emphasized that investors should hold a widely mixed
portfolio of junk bonds.
   ``Diversification remains the key,'' it said. ``The amount of any
one issue should be watched, since exposure to one company or one
industry remains dangerous for junk bonds, just as for commerical
loans.''
   The study found the cumulative default rate over the five years
would be 13.16 percent in the soft-landing scenario, 13.14 percent
during a small recession, 13.34 percent during a large recession and
18.82 percent in the deep inflationary recession.
   It said these default rates are similar to those found in other
recent studies including one released earlier this year by the
Harvard Business School.
   At the same time, the study said the total rate of return over
the five years would be 72.50 percent in the soft-landing scenario,
70.44 percent during a small recession, 80.32 during a big recession
and 54.45 in the deep inflationary recession.

   The Transportation Department asked Tuesday for
more details about a Los Angeles investor's plan to buy NWA Inc.,
parent company of Northwest Airlines.
   Alfred Checchi announced the nearly $4 billion deal June 19, but
department approval is required for the sale to proceed. The
department is examining impact of the proposed sale on the airline's
financial health.
   Government aviation analyst John V. Coleman asked in a letter to
Checchi's Wings Holdings Inc. about the extent of foreign
involvement in the sale. Investors include KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
and several U.S. financial interests, including Bankers Trust New
York Corp.
   Coleman wants the identity and citizenship of each partner and
the percentage share of each person in the partnership, as well as
whether any of Bankers Trust's shares would be held for other
owners, who they are and their citizenship.
   He also wants a detailed statement of the sources and uses of
acquisition financing, the investors' appraisal of NWA assets, any
plans for sale or aquisition of airline assets and details of debt
financing to be used in the purchase.
   Transportation Samuel Skinner told NWA Chairman Steven Rothmeier
in May that the department was concerned the acquisition might have
a ``substantial adverse impact'' on Northwest's financial structure.
   But after Skinner met with Checchi two weeks ago, a department
spokesman said the secretary was keeping ``an open mind'' on the
sale proposal.
   The sale would raise NWA's debt to $3.7 billion from $945
million, according to Standard and Poor's Corp. The credit-rating
agency said interest on the debt would cut the airline's operating
cash flow nearly in half.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Class-Action Lawsuit for 20,000 Winners of Botched Contest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Kraft attorney said the company's botched
``Ready to Roll'' promotional game was just an innocent mistake, but
a judge ruled Tuesday that the estimated 20,000 winners are entitled
to seek relief in a class-action lawsuit.
   Many of the winners may have rushed out to buy Kraft cheese after
learning of the highly publicized mistake, attorney Robert Johnson
told Circuit Judge Kenneth Gillis.
   Those people should not be able to seek the same relief as those
who played the game before the mistake was publicized, Johnson said.
   The players' intent in buying the product is irrelevant,
countered plaintiffs' attorney Burton Weinstein, who accused Kraft
USA of ``taking advantage of that great American obsession with
gambling to sell cheese.''
   Gillis granted a motion by Weinstein and several other attorneys
seeking to certify the winners as a class. Doing so allows all
20,000, and anyone else who comes forth with a winning game piece on
or before Oct. 31, to seek the relief.
   The contest involved matching left-side game pieces from
specially marked packages of Kraft cheese singles with right-side
pieces available in newspaper inserts distributed in the Chicago and
Houston metropolitan areas.
   More than 10,000 people claimed they had won what was intended to
be the single grand prize _ a $17,000 Dodge van.
   The suburban Chicago-based company maintains that a printing
error resulted in a total of about 21,000 winners for four different
prizes, rather than the 8,600 it anticipated for 8,000 packages of
cheese; 500 skateboards; 100 bicycles; and, at odds of
15-million-to-1, a 1990 Dodge Caravan LE.
   Kraft nullified the game June 12 after learning of the error and
ordered the specially marked packages of cheese pulled from store
shelves. The company contended it was not legally liable for any of
the prizes because of the errors.
   On June 15, the company offered to quadruple the number of prizes
originally offered and to add cash prizes and special drawings. The
proposal came after Kraft entered into agreements of voluntary
compliance with the attorneys general of Illinois and Texas.
   Under the new payout plan, players who matched game pieces for
the van and submitted them by a June 16 deadline would receive $250
and be eligible for a drawing scheduled for Friday, in which four
vans will be awarded.
   But eight winners have already filed lawsuits, and thousands more
are expected to, Weinstein said.
   The eight lawsuits have been consolidated and will become part of
the class-action case, to be filed within a seven-day time frame set
by the judge, he said.

<HEAD>Delta Turns to ESOP Amid Takeover Speculation in Airline Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines' decision to establish an employee
stock ownership plan is being widely viewed as a deterrent to
unwanted suitors at a time when takeover speculation has swept
through the airline business.
   NWA Inc., the Minneapolis parent of Northwest Airlines, recently
was the subject of a takeover battle; Chicago-based UAL Corp., the
parent of United Airlines, has been the subject of recent media and
Wall Street speculation that it might be targeted for acquisition;
and Atlanta's Delta has been mentioned often in recent months as an
attractive candidate for a takeover.
   Delta, the nation's third largest carrier, generally does not
comment on such speculation. Officials said the ESOP, announced
Monday, was not intended as a guard against a takeover.
   ``We prefer to focus on the business aspect of the move. As far
as the ESOP, it brings more in line the employee interest and the
shareholder interest,'' Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said Tuesday. ``It
gives the employees a much bigger stake in the company.''
   Lundy said he was not aware of any other major airlines having
ESOPs, but he noted employee stock ownership has become increasingly
common throughout U.S. industry.
   Delta's move, which came the same day as an announcement of a 2.5
million-share stock sale to Swissair, was seen by some analysts as
an attempt to erect a barrier to anyone considering a hostile
takeover of the airline.
   They noted that the ESOP, combined with the Swissair purchase,
would put 19 percent of the company's stock in friendly hands.
   In trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Delta fell 50
cents a share to $71.25.
   Robert J. Joedicke, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
in New York, said Delta's actions appeared to be wise.
   ``I think it's a prudent move with that (possible takeovers) in
mind,'' Joedicke said. ``A company, NWA, with similar
characteristics just went through the same (takeover) situation.
   ``You can't establish these things after you get a phone call
saying, `We're going to make a bid for you.'''
   Joedicke said ESOPs are a ``sign of the times'' in an age of
corporate raiders and debt-financed buyouts of large corporations.
   He said airlines are as likely as any to spark the interest of
takeover artists. Airlines' assets, particularly their valuable
fleets of jets, make them especially attractive.
   ``They (takeovers) tend to go through industries,'' Joedicke
said. ``Food was great, with Beatrice and RJR Nabisco. When they
finish running through that industry, they've got to look elsewhere
for likely candidates.''
   Paul P. Karos, an airline industry analyst with First Boston
Corp., said ESOPs have the added benefit of solidifying the loyalty
of the workforce.
   ``It has a motivating effect on the employees, and it gives them
incentive to do a good job,'' Karos said.
   Under the Delta ESOP, nearly 7 million shares of Delta preferred
stock were purchased for about $500 million. The shares will be
allocated to employees in lieu of existing cash contributions to the
plan, but they can be converted into common stock shares worth
$86.40 each.
   The preferred stock will pay 6 percent a year in dividends.
   The Swissair deal called for the sale of 2.5 million shares of
Delta common stock to the Swiss carrier for $193.3 million, or about
$77 a share. The agreement includes a reciprocal purchase by Delta
of up to 100,000, or 5 percent, of Swissair's shares.
   The two airlines agreed in March to develop joint operating and
marketing agreements.

   Jailed tax shelter scam artist John Peter
Galanis consented to a permanent court order Tuesday that bars him
from involvement with registered investment companies or advisers.
   The injunction, issued at federal court in San Francisco, also
prohibits Galanis, 46, formerly of Del Mar, Calif. and Greenwich,
Conn., from trading securities for anyone other than himself or his
immediate family.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission brought the action in a
civil complaint that charged Galanis and four other men with an
alleged 1986 fraud and embezzlement plot that involved the theft of
$4 million from ISI Corp., an Oakland, Calif.-based investment
advisory company.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Galanis, who is serving a
27-year sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson,
Ariz., consented to the injunction.
   In addition to his federal prison term for a 1988 conviction in
New York on numerous securities law and related violations, he also
was convicted in New York state court of grand larceny.

   Pro-democracy protests that paralyzed Beijing and
other cities did not hurt the economy badly, but longstanding
problems such as inflation remained serious, a government spokesman
said Tuesday.
   Yuan Mu told a news conference retail prices rose 25.5 percent in
the first six months of the year over the same period of 1988.
   He said most of the increase actually took place at the end of
last year, when inflation peaked at about a 36 percent annual rate,
the highest in 40 years of communist rule and a factor in widespread
public dissatisfaction with the government.
   ``The momentum of inflation has been checked but ... in the
second half of the year we will have to make great efforts to keep
prices visibly lower than last year,'' he said.
   The government adopted harsh austerity measures last fall to curb
inflation, including a ban on new construction and halt to many
projects already under way. New taxes were introduced on China's
tiny but prosperous private sector and on luxury imports.
   Yuan said investment in fixed assets had been cut 7 percent from
the first half of last year, to $12 billion. The pace of growth in
retail sales has fallen, he said, and the money supply has been cut.
   Economists have blamed China's inflation on a combination of too
much investment, especially in luxury hotels and office buildings,
too much consumer spending and easy credit.
   ``The economic situation is still not rationalized,'' Yuan said.
Problems, he added, remain ``quite serious.''
   Official reports last week said processing industries continued
to grow faster than raw material production, creating shortages that
also have contributed to price increases.
   Recent reports also put the trade deficit at $5.7 billion for the
first half of the year. However, Yuan said the actual deficit was
$3.8 billion, taking donations into account and deducting from the
import figure equipment brought into the country as foreign
investment.
   He said actual foreign investment was up 32.7 percent, to $3.76
billion, while contracts were signed for an additional $1.7 billion
in investment.
   He said the figures showed that the impact of the seven weeks of
protests in Beijing and June 3-4 army crackdown were ``not very
serious.'' Foreign disapproval expressed in the form of sanctions
could hurt China's economy in the short term, he added, but in the
long run would only ``inspire a spirit of plain living and hard
struggle and relying on our own efforts.''
   Beijing city officials have put direct economic losses from the
protests and fighting at $347.5 million.
   Yuan said prospects for the summer harvest were good after four
straight years of poor agricultural performance. He said all summer
crops were expected to yield 93 million tons, up more than 2 tons
from last year.
   Official media reports in the past two weeks have acclaimed the
crop that is being harvested now as a bumper one, due largely to
good rainfall in regions hit by a serious drought last year.
   But the harvest presents the state with a new dilemma: how to pay
for grain that the peasants are required to sell directly to the
government. Last fall, lacking cash, the state gave many peasants
IOUs, but it has pledged not to do so this year.

   Railways, docks and city hall services were
disrupted on Tuesday in the most severe week of strikes for higher
pay since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher took office 10 years ago.
   Meanwhile, a survey of public opinion polls by the British
Broadcasting Corp. showed Mrs. Thatcher trailing in popularity for
the first time.
   Late Tuesday, the first direct negotiations since May between
state-run British Rail and unions broke down when union
representatives walked out after the two sides failed to agree on a
pay raise.
   Speaking to Parliament, Mrs. Thatcher condemned the city hall
walkouts.
   ``Once again it is some of the extreme left wing in the trade
unions who never think of serving the public or of their duty to the
public,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   The prime minister spoke hours after the BBC's Poll of Polls
reported Neil Kinnock's Labor Party had a 10-point lead over Mrs.
Thatcher's governing Conservative Party.
   Commuters struggled to get home Tuesday as hundreds of trains
were canceled nationwide on the second day of a ban on overtime by
the train workers' union, the Associated Society of Locomotive
Engineers and Firemen.
   Unions want a 10 percent pay raise, but British rail has offered
them 7 percent. They say a major cause of this summer's labor unrest
is an annual inflation rate of 8.3 percent _ the highest in seven
years _ which has eaten into wages.
   Rail workers also want British Rail to continue its national pay
bargaining, which the company has said will be replaced on Oct. 31
with regional negotiations.
   The National Union of Railwaymen said it would go ahead with
Wednesday's 24-hour strike, the fourth in as many weeks. Subway
train drivers were also to strike Wednesday in the 10th stoppage
since April 5th.
   The Transport and General Workers Union said 96 percent of its
9,400 dock workers stayed away on the first day of an indefinite
strike for job guarantees at 60 ports nationwide. But the National
Association of Port Employers said the dock workers were split, with
18 of the 60 ports operating normally.
   A 48-hour pay strike by the National Association of Local
Government Workers, the second in two weeks, closed libraries, day
care centers for the handicapped and mentally ill, museums,
municipal colleges, and local inspection and tax offices.
   The union said 90 percent of its nearly half a million members
were out, paralyzing city halls. The union threatened a three-day
strike next week.
