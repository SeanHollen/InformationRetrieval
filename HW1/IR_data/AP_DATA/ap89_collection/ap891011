<TEXT>
   The State Department expressed concern
Wednesday about a new crackdown by Panamanian authorities on civil
liberties, while President Bush tried to end the recriminations
with key members of Congress that followed last week's failed coup
attempt.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said a ``package of war
laws'' is being decreed by the the Panamanian government as part of
an effort to ``eliminate the last vestiges of democracy and rule of
law.''
   As an example, she said civil servants could be fired for
disloyalty under the new measures being planned and the right of
habeas corpus is to be eliminated.
   ``These war laws purportedly will strip Panamanians of their
remaining civil liberties and human rights,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Bush summoned Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. William Cohen
R-Maine, the vice chairman, following a week of congressional
criticism about the way the administration handled the abortive
uprising.
   In a statement issued afterward, Boren indicated that the
meeting was designed, in part, to avoid a repeat of the snafus that
occurred during the abortive uprising last week in Panama.
   ``I feel that our discussion, which focused on intelligence
matters, will be of great help to our country if we ever confront
crises like the Panama situation in the future,'' Boren said.
Afterward, Boren flew to Oklahoma and was unavailable to elaborate
on his statement.
   Wednesday night, Bush brushed off any hint of bad feeling over
the congressional criticism he got on the Panama matter, saying
criticism was to be expected always, and said he had an amiable
meeting with Boren and Cohen.
   ``There was never any bad blood,'' he told reporters at a state
dinner in honor of Italian President Francesco Cossiga.
   ``I'm not angry,'' he said in response to reports that he
heatedly chastised his staff and laid down the law that there was
to be no more second-guessing.
   Bush predicted that as the smoke clears people will agree with
him. ``I have no second guesses at all, '' he said.
   Administration officials have said that poor communications and
confused signals contributed to the failure of the coup attempt.
   Wednesday's meeting occurred three days after Boren and National
Security adviser Brent Scowcroft clashed over whether Senate
restrictions inhibited the administration's ability to fulfill its
goal of ousting Noriega.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said the meeting with the senators
concluded with everyone ``on the same wave length. I believe it was
a very good, productive meeting.''
   But on Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell
aimed new criticism at the administration for seeking to blame its
inaction on congressionally imposed constraints.
   ``The efforts by some within the administration to shift
responsibility for decisions ... to the Senate Intelligence
Committee are ill-founded, unfair and counterproductive,'' said
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   It is legitimate, he said, for Congress to inquire into ``how
the administration could have been so unprepared when what it had
long been urging took place.''
   At the State Department, Ms. Tutwiler denied assertions by some
rebel leaders who have been given sanctuary in Florida that the
insurgents were promised much more support by the United States
than was actually given.
   She specifically denied that the rebels had asked for U.S. air
support to prevent the airlifting of pro-Noriega reinforcements to
Panama City after the coup attempt got under way.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
disturbed by unnamed State Department officials quoted in newspaper
accounts as being critical of other agencies involved in the events
last week in Panama.
   She said Baker told a staff meeting last Friday he wanted to see
a stop to such criticism.
   Meanwhile, seven Latin American presidents, meeting in Peru,
discussed the proposed expulsion of Panama from an eight-member
hemispheric consultative group.
   Panama's membership was suspended in 1988 after Noriega arranged
the dismissal of President Eric Delvalle, who had tried to fire
Noriega as military commander.
   Peru and Venezuela are among members pushing for Panama's
expulsion.
   ``We cannot permit a country like Panama that scoffs at and
ridicules the democratic system to contnue with us,'' said
Guillermo Larco Cox, Peru's foreign minister.
   Diplomatic sources said Mexico and some others felt expulsion
would amount to interference in the internal affairs of another
country.

<HEAD>Board Recommends Delaying PLO Request Until 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The executive board of UNESCO recommended Wednesday
that the Palestine Liberation Organization's request for admission
to the agency be put off until 1991.
   The recommendation goes to UNESCO's highest decision-making
body, the General Conference, which begins a monthlong meeting
Tuesday.
   If the conference takes the board's advice, as appears likely,
UNESCO will be following the footsteps of the World Health
Organization, which decided in May to put off considering whether
to admit Palestine.
   The PLO's parliament-in-exile from its headquarters in Tunis,
Tunisia, last Nov. 15 declared Palestine as an independent state
without giving specific boundaries.
   The United States, which withdrew from UNESCO nearly five years
ago, had said it would not consider returning if Palestine were
admitted as a member state.
   At the World Health Organization meeting in Geneva, the United
States had threatened to withhold paying its contribution to the
budget, which amounts to 25 percent.
   The resolution approved by the UNESCO board without debate or a
vote called for close involvement of the Palestinians in activities
of the 159-nation United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization.
   The Palestinian observer at UNESCO, Omar Massalha, said the PLO
decided to accept the recommendation for postponement in order to
spare the agency any political confrontation over the issue.
   UNESCO Director-General Federico Mayor has made a determined
effort to get the United States, Britain and Singapore to rejoin
the world body.
   The Americans and British left because they said the
organization had become too political, spent too much money and was
poorly managed. Singapore pulled out saying it could spend its dues
better elsewhere.
   The resolution calls for the ``closest possible participation of
Palestine in the action of UNESCO, in particular through its
programs and full benefits of the scholarship programs.''
   It says the Palestine observer mission now can make requests to
participate in UNESCO programs directly instead of going through
the Arab League as it has in the past.
   Mayor has drawn up an 82-page study for the board outlining ways
the Palestinians can become involved more closely in UNESCO
activities.

   Panamanian rebels involved in last week's failed
coup attempt never intended to kill Gen. Manuel Noriega when they
held him captive briefly, said one of the coup leaders seeking
political asylum here.
   Among 42 Panamanians the United States flew to Miami on Saturday
was Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking coup
participant to escape capture, said a Bush administration official
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``We're working with the immigration service so that they can
remain here, _ those that want to file for asylum,'' Mark Franken,
a refugee coordinator for the U.S. Catholic Conference, said
Wednesday. ``I expect that will take about a week.''
   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, widow of the major who led the
unsuccessful coup, also was among those airlifted to Miami. She
told The New York Times the coup was betrayed by another officer
who switched sides at the last minute.
   She said her husband, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, had worked with
Maj. Francisco Olechea, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, in
planning the coup.
   Battalion 2000, instead of fighting Noriega, was airlifted 55
miles from the fighting and led Noriega's troops to crush the coup.
``Everything was ready. But Olechea was playing a winner's game and
he failed to come through because of his cowardice,'' she told the
Times in a Miami interview.
   Franken said the Panamanians flown into Miami have told him they
want to remain in seclusion for now. But administration officials
are said to be attempting to get more information from the leaders
secluded here.
   One rebel leader said that during the daylong coup attempt on
Oct. 3, the rebels held Noriega hostage for several hours and could
have killed him at any time, The Miami Herald reported Wednesday.
   The rebel, who spoke on condition that neither his name nor the
location where he was interviewed be disclosed, said his troops
knew him as ``Commandante Trueno'' _ Commander Thunder.
   He said junior officers who took part in the coup attempt turned
Noriega over to their superiors, but that leaders of the rebellion
had no desire to kill the general.
   ``There was no intention at any time to kill the man,''
Commander Thunder said.
   When asked why, he said it may have been because a soldier would
find it hard to execute his top commander. ``It may have been their
military discipline,'' he said.
   Mrs. Giroldi told the Times that three captains who were
supposed to persuade Noriega to surrender ``didn't do it because
they were cowards.''
   ``My husband could have killed Noriega, but he would not do
that. He thought the commander's fate should be decided by the
people,'' not the United States, she told the paper.
   In their public proclamations, the rebels said they had staged
the coup to ``retire'' Noriega and five senior colonels of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   With Commander Thunder were about a dozen other rebel troops
seeking political asylum. He said they would make no statement as
they waited to hear what their fate would be.
   ``We don't want to say anything at this time,'' Commander
Thunder said. ``We are awaiting orders.''
   Family members of slain coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi also
were in the group, State Department spokesman Rich Sanders said. He
would not confirm whether the group included Giroldi's widow, Adela
Bonilla Giroldi, a key intermediary between U.S. officials and the
coup plotters.
   Earlier, one of the group said the soldiers feared for their
relatives at home.
   ``Noriega is a beast,'' said the man, who also asked not to be
identified. ``He won't stop at anything. He's going to take
reprisals against our wives, our children and our parents back in
Panama.''

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega accused
the United States on Wednesday of trying to keep its forces in
Panama to maintain control over Latin America.
   The widow of the Panamanian major who led an unsuccessful coup
against Noriega says it failed because her husband was betrayed by
another major who switched sides at the last minute, according to a
published report.
   Noriega, who blamed last week's coup attempt on the United
States, said Panama must be prepared ``because they cannot catch us
by surprise again, and even if the commander (Noriega) falls, the
people will not fall.''
   Countering what U.S. officials have been saying, Adela Bonilla
de Giroldi was quoted by the New York Times in Thursday's editions
as saying the coup was ``very well organized and coldly
calculated.''
   She said her husband, Maj. Moises Giroldi Vega, worked with Maj.
Francisco Olechea, commander of the elite Battalion 2000, in
planning the coup.
   Instead of being used to oust Noriega, however, Battalion 2000
was airlifted 55 miles from the scene of the fighting and led
Noriega's troops in crushing the coup.
   ``Everything was ready. But Olechea was playing a winner's game
and he failed to come through because of his cowardice,'' she told
the Times in an interview in Miami.
   Mrs. Giroldi was not at military headquarters during the coup
attempt on Oct. 3 and her information came from officers who took
part in the coup and, as she did, fled shortly afterwards to the
United States, the Times said.
   Noriega spoke in Panama City at the People's Power assembly.
Before he addressed the crowd, he introduced Sarah York, 11, a
Negaunee, Mich., girl on her second trip to Panama at Noriega's
invitation.
   ``She represents the truth of the American people, purity and
not hatred,'' he said as he brought his young pen pal to the podium
to wave to the crowd.
   The assembly is comprised of precinct representatives appointed
by the government to act as a legislative body. It replaces the
National Assembly, which was abolished when the provisional
government of President Francisco Rodriguez took office on Sept. 1.
   The government annulled May 7 elections, which foreign observers
say the opposition won by a 3-1 margin.
   Noriega, who commands the Defense Forces and controls the
government, said Washington's intention was not just to eliminate
him, ``but to install in power the enemies of the people.''
   Rodriguez spoke after Noriega. He called for reconciliation and
said his government was open to dialogue.
   On Tuesday, the government announced tough new measures aimed at
suppressing dissent, firing public employees considered to be
disloyal, freezing wages and suspending year-end bonuses.
   Members of the assembly demanded dismissal of ``seditious''
elements still working for the government.
   But Rodriguez, who was frequently rumored to have opposed the
laws during Cabinet meetings, said the measures should not be used
for personal revenge.
   ``The preservation of the country as our home is and must be the
paramount goal of our government,'' Rodriguez said.
   Opposition leaders and members of professional associations
expressed concern over impact of the new laws, which the government
said were meant to ``protect the economy and national security in
the face of U.S. aggression.''
   ``It is the first step in the creation of a police state,''
Christian Democratic Party leader Ricardo Arias Calderon told The
Associated Press.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington Wednesday that Panama was decreeing a ``package of war
laws'' as part of an effort to ``eliminate the last vestiges of
democracy and rule of law.''
   Panama blames Washington for its troubles. The U.S. government
imposed economic sanctions on Panama after Noriega was indicted in
February 1988 on U.S. drug charges. He denies the charges.
   Wednesday was the 21st anniversary of the military coup that
brought to power the late Omar Torrijos, the man Noriega considers
his political and ideological mentor.
   The coup deposed President Arnulfo Arias 11 days after Arias
took office. Torrijos banned political parties, exiled scores of
politicians and ruled with the help of a People's Assembly instead
of Congress.
   Torrijos signed treaties with President Carter that committed
the United States to a new relationship with Panama.
   The United States gave up its territory in the Canal Zone in
1979. Under the treaties, the United States must close its Panama
bases at the end of the century, when Panama will take over the
Canal's administration.

   Police action against cocaine suppliers is
futile unless the United States and Europe reduce the demand that
drives the illicit trade, President Carlos Andres Perez of
Venezuela said Wednesday.
   Perez spoke on opening day of a summit of seven Latin American
presidents in this desert city that also is to consider expelling
Panama as the eighth member of the Group of Eight regional
organization.
   Panama's membership was suspended in 1988 after Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega arranged the dismissal of President Eric Delvalle,
who had tried to fire Noriega as military commander.
   The Venezuelan leader called Noriega's military rule a ``masked
dictatorship.'' President Alan Garcia of Peru used his opening
remarks to ``express publicly the Peruvian people's and the
Peruvian government's repudiation and condemnation of the military
dictatorship.''
   Peru and Venezuela were expected to push for expulsion of
Panama, but diplomatic sources said Mexico and some other members
felt that would amount to meddling with the internal affairs of
another country.
   Among items on the summit's agenda besides drug trafficking are
Central America's conflicts, foreign debt and environmental damage
to the Amazon jungle.
   In his remarks on the drug trade, Peres said: ``The more demand
grows in the north, the more production will grow in the south.
Police actions will be useless unless demand is reduced.''
   Other opening statements also expressed support for Peru,
Colombia and Bolivia, which argue that President Bush's emphasis on
attacking the cocaine traffic at the source is not enough.
   The summit began the day after Presidents Garcia, Virgilio Barco
of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia invited Bush to attend
a drug summit in Latin America within 90 days. Bush accepted
immediately.
   Paz did not remain for the Group of Eight meeting because
Bolivia is not a member. Garcia and Barco were joined by Perez of
Venezuela, Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Jose Sarney of
Brazil, Carlos Menem of Argentina and Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay
at the third summit since the regional organization was formed in
1987.
   The meeting is being conducted in closed session at the Hotel
Las Dunas on the outskirts of Ica, a city of 350,000 people 185
miles southeast of Lima. Officials said earlier that the meeting
would last three days, but late Wednesday shortened the meeting to
two days without giving a reason.
   An army battlion of 300 soldiers guarded the hotel and 3,000
plaincothes policemen circulated in the city in case of attacks by
Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that began fighting Peruvian
governments in 1980. The insurgency has cost 15,000 lives by
government count.
   A car bomb police blamed on Shining Path exploded Tuesday night
outside an auto parts store in residential Lima, wounding a guard
and blowing out the windows of the shop and nearby buildings.
   Police said rebels also shot and killed a woman candidate for
deputy mayor of a Lima district Tuesday night, firing three bullets
into her head as she stood behind the counter of her pharmacy.
   Official reports said 26 other people were killed in seven
incidents Tuesday night and Wednesday, including nine policemen,
two mayors and two rural mayoral candidates.
   Diplomatic sources at the summit said the presidents were
expected to give full support to Peru, Colombia and Bolivia in
their fight against traffickers. Colombia began a crackdown on
cocaine gangs Aug. 19.
   On Tuesday, Barco, Garcia and Paz promised ``all-out war'' on
cocaine in their countries, which produce 90 percent of the world's
supply.
   Their communique stressed that stopping the cocaine trade must
be accompanied by vigorous efforts against production and
consumption.
   That reflects reservations in Latin America about Bush's
emphasis on police and military actions to stop trafficking in the
Andean nations.
   President Sanguinetti of Uruguay told reporters before the
summit began Wednesday: ``The problem is not only in Medellin. It
is also in the streets of New York City.''
   His reference was to the Medellin drug cartel, which has been at
war with the Colombian government since the crackdown began in
August.
   The three-nation communique did not elaborate on differences of
approach, but Peru, Bolivia and Colombia have requested more U.S.
economic aid to provide alternative sources of income for hundreds
of thousands of peasants who live by growing coca, the raw material
for cocaine.
   ``It's not a problem of donating some helicopters, sometimes
very old helicopters, or donating rifles or bullets,'' Garcia said
recently. ``It would be enough to offer a good price and a
guaranted market for the products that could substitute for coca.''
   He, Barco and Paz also said European leaders should attend the
drug summit. Garcia has said that, if the United States is
successful in slowing the flow of cocaine across its borders,
traffickers will shift their focus to Europe.

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly two centuries after Napoleon's
forces routed them, the Knights of Malta are returning to the
island they got from an emperor in exchange for a falcon and ruled
for 268 years.
   The ``monks in armor'' will be here Oct. 17-22 for a gathering
their leadership hopes will help bolster Malta's economy.
   Officially named the Sovereign Military Order of the Hospital of
St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, the knights are the
oldest order of chivalry and the fourth oldest religious order in
the Roman Catholic Church.
   They ruled this rocky and almost barren Mediterranean
archipelago from 1530, when Emperor Charles V gave it to them for
the price of one trained falcon a year, until 1798 when Napoleon
sent them packing without the treasures they acquired during
centuries of plundering the Ottoman Empire.
   Fra Andrew Bertie, the 78th grand master of the 900-year-old
order, has summoned the knights back and has urged them to help
Malta improve its economy.
   For centuries, membership in the knights required proof of
generations of nobility. Although some ranks today are open to
those without noble ancestry, the rolls are still crowded with the
wealthy and influential.
   The New York financier J. Peter Grace is a member, as are former
U.S. Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig, Premier Giulio Andreotti
and President Francesco Cossiga of Italy and Giovanni Agnelli,
chairman of the Italian automobile company Fiat. Edward Bennett
Williams, the Washington attorney and owner of the Baltimore
Orioles major league baseball team who died in August 1988, also
was a member.
   Such men are one reason the order's Maltese association asked
Bertie to call the knights back to Malta, which in 25 years of
independence from Britain has found the economic road as rocky as
its coastline.
   Bertie, a long-time former resident of Malta, encourged knights
worldwide to attend the first world gathering of the order and
openly solicited their help.
   ``I also urge those of you who are directly or indirectly
interested in facilitating contacts with the development of the
economic life of the island to do so,'' Bertie told the knights
earlier this year in New York.
   Roger de Giorgio, president of the Maltese association of the
ancient order now based in Rome, said about 500 of the 10,000
members are expected to travel to Malta.
   ``We want knights from around the world to exchange ideas about
our hospital work and to rediscover Malta,'' said de Giorgio.
``During the 268 years the knights were here, they introduced new
thinking in architecture, law, medicine and merchant shipping.''
   The knights made Malta a thriving center of Christianity and
trade. De Giorgio said the knights also gave Malta the legal codes
that are the basis for much of its modern law. In 1575, they built
and then operated what then was one of the largest hospitals in
Europe. They gave Malta an architectural heritage of massive
fortifications and magnificent palaces and churches.
   The knights today operate about 200 hospitals and first aid
centers in 90 countries, especially in the Third World and war
zones.
   The order was founded in the late 11th century with the opening
of a hospice for pilgrims in Jerusalem. Its centuries-old
dedication to hospital work began when it treated the sick and
wounded after the army of the First Crusade captured Jerusalem in
1099.
   It first took up arms in the 12th century to defend the pilgrim
routes to the Holy Land.
   In the late 13th century, after the Holy Land fell to the
Moslems, the knights moved first to Cyrpus and then to Rhodes where
they built a navy to fight the Moslem Ottoman Empire.
   Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent defeated the knights and forced
them to leave Rhodes on Jan. 1, 1523, although with huge losses to
his troops.
   Seven years later, the knights resumed the fight from Malta.
Once again Suleiman attacked. This time 600 knights, 1,230 mostly
Spanish soldiers and about 6,000 Maltese militia defeated an
Ottoman army of 40,000. That victory in 1565 marked the beginning
of the end for Ottoman seapower and earned the knights the
gratitude of a threatened Europe.

   On March 24, 1978, students and
soldiers burst into Tran Tuan Thi's factories, ordered them closed
and confiscated all the goods in the name of the socialist
transformation of south Vietnam.
   Now, more than 10 years after he was left a pauper, Tran heads a
private savings and loan association and runs a chicken farm, a
food processing plant and six foodstores.
   Tran is an ethnic Chinese. His own resurgence parallels the
change in Vietnam's policies toward its Chinese minority, the most
dynamic ethnic group in Vietnam.
   Eleven years ago, uniformed men broke down doors and dragged
away shopkeepers throughout the Chinese quarter, arresting
thousands as the Communist government of the north sought to bring
revolution to the recently conquered south.
   The brutal policy left the Chinese community in ruins and proved
a major factor in the deterioration of relations between China and
Vietnam.
   It also led to an exodus of tens of thousands of Chinese.
Vietnamese government officials got rich on the deal, demanding
bribes for safe passage to port towns in the south. To this day,
many of the escapees still languish in refugee camps around Asia.
   Now the government, faced with growing poverty and falling
production, has turned to the Chinese community for help in
building Vietnam.
   Chinese have been coming to Vietnam since the 3rd century B.C.
In the two milleniums since then, China ruled Vietnam for 900
years. In other times, defeated Chinese armies, criminals, starving
peasants and persecuted monks all made their way to Vietnam.
   About 400,000 ethnic Chinese live in Ho Chi Minh City, mostly in
the Cholon suburb. Estimates of Chinese nationwide vary from
600,000 to 1 million.
   ``Our recent treatment of the Chinese has not always been
completely perfect,'' acknowledges Nghi Doan, chairman of the
People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City's 5th District, which
includes Cholon. ``But now we are even accepting that their
businesses will undertake a certain level of exploitation, as long
as it benefits production.''
   These are radical words for a dedicated Communist. Nghi, himself
an ethnic Chinese, has been a party member for 43 of his 61 years.
During the Vietnam War he did underground work against the U.S. and
South Vietnamese governments.
   In some cases, property confiscated from Chinese has been
returned. Starting early this year, businessmen were allowed to
open private banks. An ad hoc stock market has formed among Chinese
traders. Government officials turn a blind eye to the black market,
and privately owned factories have been encouraged.
   Even big businessmen like Ly Sen, an ethnic Chinese who was
named one of South Vietnam's three ``super-capitalists'' in a show
trial in 1975, have been released from jail and encouraged to add
their expertise to Vietnam's development.
   ``The Commies are our slaves now,'' said one Chinese merchant
who learned his colloquial English from American GI customers
during the war. ``They need us more than we need them.''
   But the change has not completely satisfied the Chinese.
   Chairman Nghi estimates that production for District 5 has yet
to reach half of what is was during the Vietnam War years, when
little factories, bars and restaurants served an international
clientele of American soldiers and Southeast Asian businessmen.
   Chinese community leaders estimate that tens of thousands still
want to leave Vietnam. And many Chinese businessmen say they are
worried the government's policies might turn radical again.
   ``I'm not doing anything big right now,'' said the Chinese
merchant. ``I don't know when Big Boss is going to crack down. Most
of us are just watching.''
   But others, like Tran Tuan Thi, are going full steam ahead.
   Several years ago as reform policies began, Tran scraped
together some capital from friends and started a food processing
factory. Then he rented out storefronts to sell his goods.
   Impressed with his success, the government contacted Tran and
offered him land to start a chicken farm. Tran jumped at the chance
for a joint venture with the state,.
   ``I've got a lot of guts,'' he said. ``But I also figured the
more I work with the government, the less chance there is of them
taking things away from me.''
   Six months ago, Tran started a private bank, the New City
Savings and Loan Association. Together with Ly, who was a top
banker during the war, he amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars
worth of investments.
   Loans are made at 8 percent to 10 percent a month. And deposits
pay 7 percent a month, compounded quarterly, or 125 percent a year,
Ly says.
   The rates, which battle Vietnam's annual inflation of at least
30 percent, are higher than the government's monthly rate of 5
percent for deposits and 8 percent for loans.
   ``They trust us, they trust me,'' Ly said, explaining his
success. ``I've been a banker all my life so they have
confidence.'' Another reason is that customers can withdraw their
money freely. State banks still demand a list of reasons, and often
substantial bribes, to approve withdrawals.
   Ly's son and daughter both escaped to the United States as boat
people. His wife also left several months before he was let out of
jail in 1987 after 12 years.
   Despite the changes in Vietnam, he said he still hopes to leave.
   ``I'm an old man and miss my family,'' says the 64-year-old. ``I
was once part of this country's future but now I'm part of its
past.''

   Denis Goldberg no longer feels uneasy in a crowd.
But whenever he sits down to write his memoirs, the recollections
of 21 years in a South African prison still overwhelm him.
   He served the longest prison term imposed on a white militant,
and now is in his fifth year in British exile. But he says the
ideals that got him, Nelson Mandela and six other black
nationalists locked up for plotting to overthrow the white-led
minority government made his life sentence bearable.
   ``I didn't count every day I was in prison, but I calculated
it,'' Goldberg, now 56, says in an interview. ``I was there 7,904
days. I don't regret one day, it was worth it.
   ``I certainly do not repudiate my past actions. I do not
repudiate the armed struggle _ I think it's essential.''
   At 29, Goldberg was an engineer turned bomb-maker for the
African National Congress, the banned black nationalist movement.
He was arrested at an ANC hideout in Johannesburg and given three
life sentences in June 1964 for ``campaigning to overthrow the
government by violent revolution.''
   Deported in 1985 after undertaking not to participate in
political violence, he now runs the ANC's mail order business in
north London selling mostly T-shirts and posters. He lectures
occasionally in Britain and abroad.
   On Tuesday, President F.W. de Klerk said he will free five of
Goldberg's co-defendants, including ANC political strategist Walter
Sisulu, but not Mandela.
   The other co-defendant, Govan Mbeki, was freed in 1987.
   Goldberg calls their release ``a public relations exercise to
show de Klerk is amenable to change.''
   It took Goldberg two years to adjust to freedom in London.
Finally, one morning, ``suddenly I felt at ease; The crowds didn't
bother me.''
   ``There's a lot of softness and gentleness outside that is
enriching,'' he says. ``It sounds corny but it's very, very true. I
find life incredibly exciting, fulfilling and worthwhile.''
   His wife Esme, 60, says: ``Prison made him tender.''
   But the memories of prison run deep.
   ``I find that when I do sit down to write about it, I simply
don't sleep,'' he said. ``A recollection of one incident brings
back a whole chain of incidents and events, and I find that this
just overwhelms me.''
   The former engineer said he gradually was driven to violence by
revulsion for apartheid, the race-separation system under which 5
million whites disenfranchise 28 million blacks.
   He's chubbier now and losing his hair, and his quirky humor
masks a deep hurt at having missed seeing his two children grow up.
   His son, David, was 8 and his daughter, Hilary, 5 when he left
Cape Town in May 1963, intent on fleeing abroad. A bomb had
exploded in his garden, obscenities were painted on his car and
police were clamping down on dissidents. He stayed on briefly to
organize arms production for the ANC.
   ``Had I not been arrested, I would have gone on to start
production of land mines and grenades and timing devices and so
on,'' he says. ``Bomb-maker is a pejorative term. My people said
that what I was doing was just and justified.''
   Goldberg served most of his sentence in the whites-only Pretoria
Prison.
   ``In a country where prison is the norm in the lives of most
black South Africans, it was perhaps a way of identifying,'' he
said. ``That we could survive and come out relatively whole people
is really a victory over people who try to smash us.''
   After a reunion with his family, who had moved to Britain during
his trial, he said his son, then 29 and married with children,
``needed me to tell him I hadn't left him.''
   ``I told him I didn't see how I could ever make my family above
all other families,'' he says. ``Kids suffer and starve not because
their parents are politically active, but that's the nature of
apartheid, and I felt I had to do something.''
   His eyes reddened with emotion behind horn-rimmed glasses.
   ``I've had some suffering. So! Lots of people have died. People
are getting hanged, people are getting shot. I'm alive. Life's
great.''

<HEAD>Mudslide in Amazon Gold Pit Kills Eight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight miners were killed and five
injured when a hill of loose earth gave way at a gold mining pit in
the northeastern Amazon state of Para, officials said.
   The disaster occurred around Wednesday morning in the remote
mountain range of Serra Pelada, some 1,900 miles northwest of Rio,
when a 50-foot wall of loose earth collapsed and swallowed the men
alive, said Manoel Candido, leader of the Serra Peleda Mining
Cooperative.
   ``A wall of earth completely smothered them,'' Candido said by
telephone.
   Candido said the victims were among a group of some 40 men
working at the time of the mudslide in the mine, known as the
``Deep Hole.''
   Some 25,000 miners work in the region, he said.
   ``The earth is very loose in the region. Those miners were
warned not to mine in the area but there are not enough police to
keep them away,'' Candido said. He said a similar accident occurred
near the mine site two weeks ago, killing three miners.
   Rescue teams of civil and state police arrived at the site hours
after the disaster and pulled a number of men from the earth, he
said.
   ``We've saved some but there could be others still buried,''
Candido said. He said the rescue workers would search for more
victims through the night.
   Such accidents have grown more common since an estimated 1
million prospectors invaded Brazil's vast Amazon jungle after rich
deposits of alluvial gold were discovered there in 1979.
   Since then, thousands of people, mostly unskilled peasants, have
been lured to mine sites where they dig with their hands and carry
bags of mud on their backs and up precarious rope ladders.

   An officer aboard the amphibious assault
ship USS Iwo Jima was killed and another wounded Wednesday by
shrapnel or projectiles fired by another ship during a gunnery
exercise in the Atlantic Ocean, the Navy said.
   The accident occurred about 5:30 p.m. EDT while the Iwo Jima
took part in an exercise with the amphibious cargo ship USS El Paso
about 80 miles southeast of Norfolk, said Lt. Cmdr. John Lloyd, a
spokesman for the Atlantic Fleet.
   The two officers were struck by objects fired from the El Paso's
close-in weapons system, Lloyd said. The Iwo Jima sustained no
apparent damage and no one else was injured, Lloyd said.
   The injured officer, whose identity was withheld until relatives
could be fied, was treated on the Iwo Jima then flown to Portsmouth
Naval Hospital, where he was in stable condition Wednesday night,
Lloyd said.
   The dead officer's identity was not released until his family
could be reached.
   Lloyd said further details were not immediately available on the
accident, which is being investigated by the Navy.
   Both vessels had left Norfolk earlier in the day to conduct
exercises as part of the Mediterranean Amphibious Ready Group,
Lloyd said.

   Britain's first public auction of
llamas did little for the long-eyelashed beast of burden's new
status as a fashionable pet.
   Of the 24 llamas and three alpacas on auction Wednesday at the
National Agriculture Center, one-third were sold but the remainder
were withdrawn because bidders did not offer the minimum reserve
price, said Jonathan Wheeler, a spokesman for the center.
   The South American livestock have been gaining in popularity
both as pets and for their highly prized fleece.
   The highest price paid was $8,000 for a 4-year-old female llama,
but a final bid of $11,200 for two alpacas came in below the
reserve price. Several male llamas were sold for less than $300,
Wheeler said.
   Pamela Walker, secretary of British Camelids Ltd., an owners and
breeders group, estimated there are 700 and 1,000 privately owned
llamas and alpacas in Britain.
   ``They are lovable, intelligent creatures and you can get very
attached to them,'' she said. ``They are resilient to the cold
winters, do not need particularly lush pastures for grazing and
small children can ride them without fear of any aggression.''

   The pilot zoomed low between
the pink, craggy peaks of the Sheep Mountains, suddenly twisting
his F-16 Falcon vertically into the desert sky before diving on the
target, a railroad bridge.
   Capt. Kevin ``Omar'' Bradley's plane plunged toward the bridge
as he pushed his ``pickle'' button, simulating bombs away. Bradley
pointed the Falcon's nose up, climbed radically and turned,
eliciting groans from his reporter passenger as the ``Gs''
increased to seven times the force of gravity.
   The lean, 30-year-old pilot from Binghamton, N.Y., didn't seem
bothered. ``We have to do a lot of things to keep in condition,''
he said.
   Bradley pushed the fighter past Mach 1, through the sound
barrier, and with a sonic boom for salute, headed back toward the
Tactical Fighter Weapons Center at Nellis Air Force Base, known in
the Tactical Air Command as ``The Home of the Fighter Pilot.''
   Despite improved superpower relations, with hopes high for
general world peace, professional warriors are still working to
keep a combat edge. ``Gunsmoke'' a biennial competition, decides
the ``best of the best'' in Air Force precision gunnery and bombing.
   ``Peace is breaking out all over, so why maintain the edge?''
asked Maj. Gen. Billy McCoy, a 6-foot-4 Texan who flew 223 missions
in Vietnam and commands the fighter training center at Nellis.
   ``Every kid (competing in Gunsmoke) will tell you today that we
have always dickered best from a position of strength. ... We ought
to have a pair of Russian generals out here. I'd host 'em for the
whole two weeks,'' said McCoy.
   As Bradley soared away from the target area in his fighter, a
formation of A-10 Thunderbolt pilots from the Connecticut Air
National Guard swept by, completing bombing and strafing runs that
were part of the two-week shooting competition, which ends Saturday.
   The Connecticut fliers are joined by guard units from Terre
Haute, Ind., Sioux City, Iowa, and Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M.,
and by reserve units from Luke Air Force Base, Ariz., Grissom Air
Force Base, Ind., and Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas.
   They are competing against regular Air Force units from as far
away as Japan, Alaska, the Philippines and West Germany.
   The fliers at Nellis already have won competitions in their home
units and are vying to be ``Top Guns,'' an Air Force-wide honor
held for two years.
   Maj. Patrick Hoy of Falls City, Neb., who was ``Top Gun'' in his
A-10 Thunderbolt two years ago, said, ``I don't think any rational
individual would wish to be at war, but it can be difficult being a
warrior when peace is breaking out.
   ``The biggest problem the U.S. has to deal with when we are not
in conflict is complacency. ... If you have a garden and you leave
it for a few days, the weeds begin to grow.''
   During competition, Capt. Angus Simpson, an A-10 pilot from
Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, put all 200 rounds in the white
target panel sitting on the arid wasteland that is fighter pilot
heaven north of Las Vegas. It was the first such perfect score,
said Capt. Tom Christie, an Air Force spokesman.
   For Bradley, becoming a fighter pilot was a childhood dream
nurtured by an uncle who took him to air shows. He started flying
single-engine propeller planes when he was 17. Now, piloting the
super-sophisticated F-16 over the Sheep Mountains, he is at the top
end of the Air Force dream sheet.
   ``For me, there is nothing else,'' Bradley said. ``Everything
else is a zero. My family has a business. I had no aptitude
whatsoever for it. The only thing for me was flying.''
   The flier, nicknamed ``Omar'' for the World War II general,
faces the possibility he will never fire a shot in anger.
   ``The slogan for tactical aviation is `Readiness is our
profession,''' he said. ``The military needs to detach itself from
the emotions'' about hopes for relaxed tension between the
superpowers.
   Without the ordeal of combat to provide the ultimate warrior's
test, the fliers use competitions such as ``Gunsmoke,'' the biggest
of its kind, to maintain their adrenaline levels.
   ``Next to my marriage and the birth of my children, it was the
most exciting moment of my life to be able to sit back in a moment
of quiet reflection and realize that on that day, I was the best,''
Hoy said.

   It is not only the tens of thousands of ordinary
workers, students, housewives and shopkeepers who are complaining
about conditions in East Germany and berating its leaders.
   Even privileged Communist Party members, some of them world
renowned figures in the sports, musical and theater worlds, have
joined the chorus.
   Many of them risk jeopardizing the special status they enjoy if
their criticisms get too loud.
   Still, authors, entertainers, artists and sports personalities
have urged the hard-line leadership to re-examine its policies and
open a dialogue with opposition groups.
   The calls have ranged from a joint appeal by as many as 300 East
Berlin artists to individual statements by such prominent authors
as Christa Wolf.
   Katarina Witt, the two-time Olympic figure skating gold medalist
and possibly the best-known East German abroad, said the Communist
government must think about the causes for the exodus of its people
to the West.
   About 50,000 East Germans have fled West in recent months,
either crossing Hungary's recently opened border to Austria or
after seeking refuge in Bonn's embassies in Prague, Czechoslovakia,
and Warsaw, Poland.
   The exodus deeply embarrassed the government last weekend during
40th anniversary festivities that were overshadowed by nationwide
demonstrations unseen since Soviet tanks crushed a workers'
uprising in 1953.
   ``It makes me sad, it hurts me that so many people have left the
country,'' Ms. Witt told reporters in Munich, West Germany, where
she was touring this week with a show.
   ``Something will change (in East Germany),'' said Ms. Witt,
herself a member of the Communist Party and a beneficiary of the
perks bestowed on major athletic stars.
   Ms. Witt has been a glamorous ambassador of goodwill and
previously limited her political statments to praise for the
benefits of a socialist system.
   The brutal force used by security police against demonstrators
over the weekend caused some public figures to call for restraint.
   Christa Wolf, a well-known author who is widely read in West
Germany, urged both sides to show ``prudence, calm and patience.''
   In a statement broadcast by West German radio stations, she
criticized Communist authorities for outlawing the New Forum
opposition group, calling the move a ``fatal'' mistake.
   The author, whose daughter and son-in-law were arrested during
weekend demonstrations in East Berlin, called for a broad dialogue
over the future of the country.
   Kurt Masur, chief director of the famed Leipzig Gewandhause
orchestra, and cabaret star Berndt Lutz Lange joined three local
Communist Party officials in calling for a dialogue between the
opposition and authorities.
   After their statement was read on Leipzig radio about 70,000
people demonstrated in the city Monday evening. Unlike the weekend
clashes, the biggest demonstration in the current wave of protests
ended peacefully with no intervention from massive security forces.
   Actors in two East Berlin theaters have posted statements
calling for dialogue between the state and the opposition.
   A similar statement was read by the cast in the Dresden City
Theater after a recent performance. After authorities warned the
actors not to read the statement again, they stood silently on the
stage after the next performance and distributed it to the public.
   A group of 300 East Berlin painters, sculptors and other artists
have passed a resolution calling for a broad public discussion of
the country's problems. They also urged the state-controlled media
to open up to all forces seeking democratic reforms.
   A statement by 44 entertainers, including well-known East German
rock bands such as Pankow and City, criticized the ``unbearable
ignorance'' of the Communist leadership.
   The statement, published in a West Berlin newspaper, called for
reforms ``that will not remove socialism but continue to make it
possible'' in East Germany.
   Hermann Kant, president of the official Writers Union and a
member of the Communist Party Central Committee, wrote an open
letter to the Junge Welt newspaper criticizing censorship in the
media.
   The letter, published on Monday by the official youth newspaper,
said it would be wrong to abscribe ``our current defeat'' to the
``evil class enemy.''
   East Germany's state-run newspapers have bitterly denounced
Western, particularly West German media, blaming them for
triggering the exodus and instigating the protests.

   Vandals wrapped thousands of Los Angeles
Times newspapers with fake front pages criticizing the newspaper's

   The crudely fashioned cover sheets were discovered in Times

   The phony front pages with a ``Los Angels Times'' masthead
included front-page stories with such headlines as ``U.S. Wages
Kinder, Gentler War in El Salvador'' and ``We Must Have Been
Asleep, Times Editors Declare.''
   Salvadoran peace activists have used similar bogus newspaper
covers in other cities, including Washington, D.C., and San
Francisco, although no one claimed responsibility for Tuesday's Los
Angeles incident.
   ``We feel the perpetrators' view of our coverage is erroneous,''
said Times Editor Shelby Coffey III. ``They are perfectly free to
have their opinions, but they are wrong in vandalizing our news
racks to express those opinions.''

   Ex-CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite says he
misses television journalism, but has kept busy sailing and working
occasionally since retiring eight years ago.
   ``Every time there's a big breaking story, I wish I were sitting
there at the desk making decisions on how we're going to cover it,
who ought to cover it,'' said the man once considered America's
most trusted newsman.
   Cronkite was in Annapolis on Monday for a meeting of the Board
of Visitors of the University of Maryland's College of Journalism.
   Cronkite, an avid sailor, said he is still busy with work as a
special correspondent for CBS News, remains on CBS' board of
directors and has been involved with numerous projects for CBS and
the Public Broadcasting Service.
   But the part-time work fails to take the place of the hectic
day-to-day pace of broadcast journalism.
   ``Right now, the developments in Eastern Europe, gee, I'd like
be on top of that story,'' he said.

   Rip Taylor may dress in star-spangled
jackets, wield a mean noisemaker and cover his audiences in
confetti, but he says he's also an actor.
   But Taylor hasn't managed to convince the producers of films,
television shows and commercials that he presents more than his act.
   ``When I go in for a reading they say `Where's the confetti?'''
said Taylor, who is performing at Resorts International Casino
Hotel. ``It's very hard to be taken seriously. I just want to
branch out because, you know, all the best actors are comedians.''
   Taylor was asked to play himself in ``Repossessed,'' his latest

   Actor Dennis Weaver, the cowpoke-detective in
the 1970s TV series ``McCloud,'' is riding to the rescue of the
hungry.
   ``It's simple,'' Weaver said Tuesday. ``You see a problem, you
try to help fix it. There were times we were just overwhelmed with
red tape and problems, and I wanted to run and hide.
   ``It is a frightening problem.''
   Weaver, with actress Valerie Harper and others, created
L.I.F.E., or Love Is Feeding Everyone, about six years ago.
According to the county Healh Services Department, L.I.F.E. feeds
about 60,000 people each week.
   The organization collects food from store chains and delivers it
to other groups that dispense it to the needy. The program has been
so successful that Weaver and others want other cities to start
more L.I.F.E. chapters.
   ``We are one people in this country and on this planet, and
there is no use pretending that other people's hunger doesn't touch
those of us who are well fed,'' said Weaver, who won an Emmy for
portraying Chester Good in the television series ``Gunsmoke.''

   An 11-year-old girl who once said she
wanted to sing better than Barbra Streisand has been selected to
star on Broadway in a sequel to the hit musical ``Annie.''
   Danielle Findley of Lee's Summit will play the lead role in
``Annie 2,'' a $7 million musical opening in March. She beat out
more than 400 girls who auditioned in New York, Washington, D.C.,
and Los Angeles, it was announced Tuesday in New York.
   ``This has been a lifelong dream for her,'' Danielle's mother,
Brenda Lasater, said Tuesday. ``When she was 4, she went to the
Midland Theater (in Kansas City) and saw `Annie.' She said, `I want
to be Annie someday.'''
   Danielle is described as highly motivated. Told once that she
was a good singer, she replied, ``I want to be better than Barbra
Streisand.''
   The press agent for ``Annie 2,'' David Powers, said Danielle
best met the attributes that Director Martin Charnin was looking
for: a girl with the qualities of the original Annie, Andrea
McArdle, with an ``Ethel Merman-like voice,'' acting talent, spunk,
tap-dancing ability, and no fear of dogs.
   The new production, subtitled ``Miss Hannigan's Revenge,'' goes
into rehearsal next month and begins an out-of-town tryout Dec. 22
at Washington's Kennedy Center. It opens March 1 at the Marquis
Theatre in New York after several weeks of previews.
   This will not be Danielle's first Broadway appearance. When she
was 8 she spent seven months appearing in ``Coastal Disturbances,''
playing one of several children vacationing at a New England beach.
   Danielle, a student at Pleasant Lea Elementary School in Lee's
Summit, starred in a production of ``Annie'' at Kansas City's
Starlight Theater in July.
   She began performing in Kansas City area talent competitions
when she was 5. She has taken voice, acting and flute instruction
and studied jazz, tap and ballet dancing.
   The original ``Annie'' was a Broadway smash, opening in April
1977 and running for 2,377 performances.
   In the sequel, the lead character's dog, Sandy, is being
replaced by a mixed-breed named Beau, who was adopted at a tender
age by trainer Bill Berloni. Berloni trained the original Sandy,
who is now 16 or 17 ``and quite arthritic,'' said Powers.

   Gunmen on motorcycles Tuesday killed two
employees of the newspaper El Espectador in an attempt by cocaine
traffickers to force the Bogota daily to end its anti-drug crusade.
   Later Tuesday, the spasm of violence in Medellin worsened as
assailants shot to death a journalist on a downtown street and
killed four people in a working-class neighborhood bar.
   Police said the unidentified assassins killed Roberto Sarasty,
the 55-year-old director of Cronista Democratica magazine, while he
was walking with another journalist. His companion was slightly
wounded.
   At about the same time, another group fired at a crowd at a bar
in Manrique, a northern Medellin barrio, killing four in a spray of
bullets before fleeing. Manrique is a known recruiting ground for
``sicarios,'' or hitmen used by drug traffickers.
   The shootings in Medellin, where only 11 El Espectador employees
remain, followed 13 bombings in three other Colombian cities
overnight. It was the largest outbreak of bomb attacks since drug
lords, blamed for slaying a presidential candidate, went to war
with the government nearly two months ago.
   Tuesday's violence came during a visit to Colombia by U.S. Army
Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command based in
Panama.
   Killed within an hour of each other Tuesday afternoon were Marta
Luz Lopez and Miguel Soler, a spokesman for El Espectador in this
capital told The Associated Press.
   Miss Lopez was administrator of the paper's Medellin office, and
Soler was the daily's circulation manager in the city of 2 million
people.
   In a telephone call to the paper's Medellin office, a man who
did not identify himself said a group known as the Extraditables
had killed the two and he said they would kill other El Espectador
workers who did not leave Medellin within three days, an editor at
the newspaper said on condition of anonymity.
   The Extraditables are suspected drug traffickers sought for
extradition to stand trial in the United States.
   A senior El Espectador reporter, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, told AP in a telephone interview that none of the
paper's 1,200 employees had quit, though many have received death
threats in the past.
   However, one of the paper's owners, speaking in Monterrey,
Mexico, at the annual conference of the Inter American Press
Association, said El Espectador may close its Medellin office.
   ``I don't know if we'll be able to continue operating in the
city of Medellin under the circumstances,'' said Luis Gabriel Cano,
president of the paper's editorial board.
   He also said the 102-year-old newspaper may have to close
eventually because of financial problems caused by the bombing of
the main offices last month.
   The car bomb at its Bogota building caused heavy damage and
forced the newspaper to cut operations. About 50 soldiers now guard
that building 24 hours a day.
   El Espectador publisher Guillermo Cano was assassinated by drug
traffickers in a spray of submachine gun fire Dec. 17, 1986, as he
was leaving the newspaper in his car.
   Soler was killed in front of his house Tuesday by a man who rode
by on a motorcycle, El Espectador spokesman Alfonso Bernal told the
Associated Press.
   Miss Lopez was killed by a shot in the neck, and her mother was
wounded in a leg while the two women sat in their white sedan at a
traffic light, the paper's spokesman in Bogota said.
   Nineteen people were injured by explosions in Bogota,
Barranquilla and Pereira, the police said.
   No one claimed responsibility, but authorities assume the scores
of bombs set off since August were planted by the drug gangs, who
supply 80 percent of the cocaine sold in the United States.
   There were no indications whether the overnight bombings were
connected with Thurman's visit.
   No U.S. troops are stationed in Colombia, but the United States
has delivered $65 million worth of military aid to help in the
fight against drug traffickers.
   U.S. technicians arrived last month to help train Colombians to
operate or repair some of the equipment, but were here only a few
days and none remained behind.
   President Virgilio Barco has said he does not want U.S. soldiers
in Colombia even as advisers.
   Thurman's 24-hour visit included a meeting Monday with Barco and
Gen. Miguel Maza, commander of the Administrative Security
Department, the government investigative police, the U.S. Embassy
said.
   The embassy described the meeting as routine. Thurman left
Bogota on Tuesday.
   El Tiempo, a Bogota daily usually well-informed about the
government, said Thurman also met with Gen. Oscar Botero, the
defense minister.
   The bombings Monday night and early Tuesday included nine in
Bogota that injured eight people, and three in Pereira, wounding
11, the national police said.
   Police said a man who planted one of the bombs was killed in a
shootout with officers.
   Authorities have reported 161 explosions since Aug. 19 and give
the casualties as 11 dead and 183 wounded.

   A truck thief was apparently
stopped dead in his tracks when he discovered the vehicle was
marked ``Human Remains, Extreme Care.''
   The 24-foot rental truck, stolen early Monday from a casket
company, was abandoned with its cargo, an empty shipping container
for a corpse.
   ``I think they saw `Human Remains' and said, `Oh, Lordy!''' said
Hugh Allgood, owner of Flite-Rite Co. in Fort Lauderdale. ``A lot
of people for some reason are scared of dead bodies.''
   Pointing out that his company makes caskets, Allgood wondered
about the thief's motivation: ``What ... did they think it would
have in the back? Dead fish?''
   Two similar trucks stolen from Hollywood and Fort Lauderdale
this month were stripped of their tires and radios, said Ted
Shipway, safety manager for Ryder Truck Rental in Fort Lauderdale.
   ``Probably because of the cargo, they left it,'' Shipway said.
``They must have seen the (casket) and gotten scared.''

   Peggy Rubach, diehard Chicago Cubs fan
and mayor of Mesa, says she is signing up for singing lessons to
make good on a bet with Scottsdale Mayor Herb Drinkwater
   The two last week wagered on whether the San Francisco Giants
would defeat the Cubs in the best-of-seven National League
playoffs. The Giants won the final game 3-2 Monday, winning the
series 4-1.
   Ms. Rubach now has to sing the national anthem in Scottsdale's

HoHoKam Park in Mesa and the Giants train at Scottsdale Stadium.
   Drinkwater said he plans to be at the game to record her
singing. ``I'm going to tape it and save it to use against her as
blackmail when I want something,'' he said.
   Ms. Rubach said: ``In order to ensure proper noise-abatement
procedures and to guarantee that my voice lifted in song will not
contribute to any noise pollution, I pledge to take singing lessons
between now and the game.''

   Jameson Rodgers, whose 4th birthday is Thursday, had been taught
to dial 911 in the event of an emergency. So he ran to the

use, said his father, Michael, 26.
   Jameson told fire dispatchers Tuesday night his 32-year-old
mother, Peggy, was on the floor and couldn't breathe, said fire
Battalion Chief Lon Pursell.
   ``She can't come to the phone because she's choking,'' the child
said.
   He didn't know his address, but dispatchers were able to trace
the call and paramedics arrived within a minute, Pursell said.
   Mrs. Rodgers was unconscious, but paramedics were able to
dislodge the cough drop and restore her breathing, Pursell said.

<TEXT>
   The career diplomats' union is using newly
released State Department documents in a bid to bolster its claim
that some political nominees for ambassadorships are unqualified
for their jobs.
   Less than a month after the American Foreign Service Association
filed suit to obtain the documents, the State Department last week
handed over to the union 51 ``certificates of competence'' of
ambassadorial nominees.
   In filing the suit, AFSA had said the State Department was
abusing the ``confidential'' classification to avoid embarrassment
because the certificates could not conceal the lack of
qualifications of some nominees.
   The career diplomats have complained for years about what they
regard as presidents' tendency to nominate as ambassadors
diplomatic novices at the expense of foreign service professionals.
   The State Department had repeatedly refused to comment on the
substance of the association's complaint, although department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler noted last month that President Nixon
went outside the diplomatic service when he chose George Bush as
United Nations ambassador in 1970.
   A 1980 law says ambassadorial nominees should be knowledgeable
about all aspects of the country of their assignment and that
political campaign contributions ``should not be a factor'' in the
selection process.
   One example cited by AFSA was Joseph Zappala, a Florida
developer who was nominated to be ambassador to Spain after
reportedly donating $126,000 to the Republican Party last year.
   AFSA maintained that Zappala's qualifications, as shown in the
certificate, were not consistent with requirements for background
knowledge of the host country.
   The certificate states that Zappala's ``impressive business
background in real estate combined with his civic activities
qualify him as an excellent candidate for U.S. ambassador to
Spain.'' Zappala won Senate confirmation by a 79-20 vote.
   While some political appointees, including the former ambassador
to Japan, Mike Mansfield, have excelled, others have been an
embarrassment, career diplomats say. One frequently cited example
is a former ambassador to a Caribbean country who often spent
evening hours on his luxury boat, using the sail as a screen for
showing his collection of pornographic movies.
   A Bush nominee who drew criticism from AFSA is Sally J.
Novetske, legislative representative of the National Council on
Vocational Education, selected to be ambassador to Malta.
   Her certificate called her an ``excellent candidate'' but AFSA
Vice President Charles Schmitz described her resume as ``unusually
thin.''
   Last Saturday, the Senate confirmed by voice vote two other
politically well-connected nominees whose appointments had drawn
criticism from Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md.
   They are Della Newman, a real estate broker headed for New
Zealand who managed President Bush's Washington state campaign last
year; and Melvin Sembler, a Florida real estate tycoon who is bound
for Australia after contributing $127,000 to Bush's 1988 campaign.
   Their respective certificates, released by the State Department,
described them both as ``excellent candidates'' but made little
further effort to back up the recommendations.
   Schmitz said the certificates are not prepared by the State
Department but by two Bush political appointees who work out of an
office that deals with personnel matters.

   More than 100 Chicago air traffic controllers
fired during the 1981 strike are seeking reinstatement after a
House panel said U.S. aviation officials altered time sheets and
lied to an employee appeals board.
   Citing the new evidence, attorneys for the controllers asked the
Merit Systems Protection Board to reopen the cases.
   ``Right or wrong they (the controllers) were entitled to their
day in court,'' attorney Phillip S. Wood said Tuesday. ``If it
turns out the entire evidentiary product was phony and they
destroyed the original evidence, what else is there?''
   FAA spokesman Fred Farrar said he had no comment on the petition
filed by Wood and attorney Gary Klein.
   The board upheld the firings in 1985 based on Federal Aviation
Administration attendance records, which showed that the Chicago
controllers failed to report to work during the strike.
   But a House panel last month said FAA officials doctored
evidence and lied to the board when they said the time sheets used
to defend the firings were the same ones kept during the strike.
   Instead, the subcommittee's report said, FAA officials set up a
``war room'' at the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center in
Aurora, Ill., and for three months created records to replace
original, shoddy documents.
   Wood said the controllers want their jobs back. He said he was
not disputing whether the controllers failed to report to work
during the strike by the Professional Air Traffic Controllers
Organization.
   Rather, like the subcommittee, Wood said he was concerned about
the FAA records placed before the appeals board.
   ``The board has to look beyond the litigants here,'' he said.
``It has to look at the integrity of the system. How can anyone win
when the FAA pulled what it pulled here?''
   The petition to reopen the cases was filed last week.
   The House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee has asked
the Justice Department to investigate current and former FAA
officials for possible criminal misconduct.
   During the strike, President Reagan fired 11,500 controllers,
including about 450 in Chicago.

   Private researchers charge the White House
with wholesale violations of federal record-keeping laws and say
their suit to block destruction of Reagan administration computer
tapes would not hamstring President Bush in performing his duties.
   Lawyers for several research groups filed their response Tuesday
to a Justice Department move in a case that could decide whether
the White House can routinely destroy the kind of computer messages
that were discovered in the Iran-Contra affair.
   After a chance for government lawyers to answer the new
arguments, U.S. District Judge Charles Richey will decide whether
to proceed with the case or allow it to go directly to the Court of
Appeals as the government wants.
   Richey ruled on Sept. 15 that the private organizations may sue
the president to block erasure of the tapes.
   Lawyers for the National Security Archive and other
organizations claim the Bush administration is trying to avoid
responding to inquiries that will reveal ``wholesale violations of
the Presidential Records Act and the other federal records laws
through the routine destruction of information.''
   The case involves 12 days of tapes generated on the Professional
Office System, known as PROFS, used in the Executive Office of the
President.
   On Jan. 18, two days before he left office, President Ronald
Reagan instructed staff members to erase their computer message
systems. The next day, the organizations filed suit to require the
White House to preserve backup tapes that stored these messages in
a computer bank.
   The tapes have since been preserved under a temporary
restraining order issued in January by U.S. District Judge
Barrington Parker.
   The Justice Department asked on Sept. 27 that the case be
shunted directly to the U.S. Court of Appeals, partly because it
involved ``a threat to the president's authority.''
   The organizations that filed suit denied ``such dire
consequences'' are involved. They argued that Richey's Sept. 15
order does not interfere with the president's ability to do his
duties.
   Instead, they said, the Justice Department is apparently trying
to assure the president of ``authority to make unilateral (and
unreviewable) decisions to destroy the PROFS information,
regardless of whether it falls within the definition of
`presidential records' that Congress has mandated must be preserved
for the benefit of future generations.''
   The National Security Archive, a Washington nonprofit group that
researches national security issues, filed the suit along with the
American Library Association, the American Historical Association
and the Center for National Security Studies of the American Civil
Liberties Union.
   The PROFS messages played an important role in the congressional
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair during Reagan's
admninistration.
   Oliver L. North, the White House aide at the center of the
affair, frequently sent PROFS messages to his superiors. In
November 1986, he tried to erase them, but he did not know they
were automatically being stored on magnetic tape in the central
computer bank. By using these tapes, the congressional committees
investigating the affair were able to reconstruct much of the
information.

<TEXT>
   Guns, knives and tomahawks were the
tools of war 215 years ago when the Battle of Point Pleasant raged
on a narrow strip of land where the Kanawha and Ohio rivers meet.
   Now, words and history books serve as the weapons.
   Point Pleasant claims that it, not Lexington, Mass., was the
site of the first battle of the American Revolution.
   Historians and geographers acknowledge that the battle _ known
as Lord Dunmore's War _ is important, but for other reasons.
   ``They came out this way to solve an Indian problem _ the
uprising of the Shawnee,'' said Alan Gould, a former history
professor and now Marshall University's provost. ``It can be
extremely difficult to say it's the first battle of the
Revolution.''
   But that's what Point Pleasant residents celebrated Tuesday, the
anniversary of the battle.
   Before the battle, the Virginia armies marched to invade the
Indian country. Four days later a 1,000-man division under Gen.
Andrew Lewis was attacked by about 1,000 Indians led by Chief
Cornstalk. Finally, after a nearly daylong battle, the Indians
retreated, leaving 33 dead. The Virginians had 60 killed and 96
wounded.
   The victory resulted in a treaty on terms dictated by Dunmore,
the Colonial governor.
   ``Congress has declared this a battle of the Revolution and in a
chronological list of the battles, this is the first,'' said
Bradley Reed, superintendent of the Point Pleasant Battle Monument
State Park.
   According to records at the National Society of the Sons of the
American Revolution in Louisville, Ky., Congress on Feb. 17, 1908,
passed a resolution recognizing the Battle of Point Pleasant as a
fight in the American Revolution and appropriated money for a
monument dedicated Oct. 10, 1909 _ the battle's 135th anniversary.
   Consequently, both the Sons and Daughters of the American
Revolution accept descendants from the battle as members.
   ``It's annoying that this should have to be covered up,'' said
Donald J. Pennell of Birmingham, Mich., a past historian general
for the SAR. ``We're fighting New England's hold on history. That
group has been mighty tight with history.''
   Pennell said he grew up believing that the Revolution began in
Lexington on April 19, 1775 _ six months after Point Pleasant. He
changed his mind after meeting a West Virginian who mentioned the
battle, its significance and the congressional resolution.
   ``We need a nationally recognized historian to look at this and
say, `Yea' or `Nay.' And you have to get someone away from the
Boston area,'' Pennell said. ``Nobody has ever refuted publicly the
statement in this congressional record that this is the first
battle of the Revolution.''
   Gould agrees the battle should be recognized by Congress, but
not as a Revolutionary fight.
   ``We can say that the events that precipitated the Battle of
Point Pleasant had little to do with colonial grievances against
the crown,'' Gould said. ``The impact was that it kept the Shawnees
quiet for a while when the first shots were fired in Lexington and
Concord.
   ``I don't think anyone fighting in the battle saw it as a
rebellion against the crown.''
   In 1903, the Ohio Archaeological and Historical Quarterly called
Point Pleasant the first Revolutionary fight because Dunmore put
the Indians up to it to create two battlefronts for the colonists.
   Gould said Dunmore was a loyalist but doubted whether he staged
the fight.
   Although Point Pleasant claims the first battle of the
Revolution, the historian at the Minute Men National Historical
Park in Concord, Mass., says he never heard of the conflict.
   ``I think they're reaching,'' historian Doug Sabin said.
``People often do that with historical firsts.
   Congress' resolution 81 years ago should have recognized Point
Pleasant's significance in the United States' western expansion,
said Sam Clagg, Marshall's professor emeritus in geography and the
author of West Virginia's section in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
   ``It was significant in breaking the Indian stronghold in the
West,'' Clagg said. ``It established that we were willing to make a
stand on this side of the mountains.''
   Treaties that ended hostilities in the late 1700s gave the new
country rights to lands as far west as the Mississippi largely
because of the victory at Point Pleasant, Gould said.
   Without the victory, he said, the United States would have been
granted lands only as west as the Alleghenies, leaving everything
beyond to France and Spain.
   ``I think they might be celebrating the wrong thing,'' Gould
said. ``They ought to be celebrating the significance of that
victory in American history, and that's that it secured the
frontier.''

long-distance phone services in a ``desperate'' attempt to stem the
loss of customers.
   ``They are panicking about it,'' McGowan said.
   AT&amp;T's market share has fallen to 75 percent since MCI broke the
old Bell System's monopoly on U.S. phone service in the 1970s.
MCI's share now is more than 10 percent.
   McGowan said MCI research showed AT&amp;T is losing even more than
100,000 customers a week, but MCI's marketing department, which has
been trumpeting that number in its own ads, ``likes round numbers.''
   But, he said, MCI is suffering substantial financial losses even
as it takes away AT&amp;T customers.
   The MCI lawsuit in U.S. District Court, the latest in a long
string of dustups between the nation's two leading long-distance
companies, charges AT&amp;T made false comparisons between its service
and MCI's Primetime, cut-rate long-distance calling plan.
   MCI complains about AT&amp;T ads that say MCI's rates are cheaper
only when brief calls are made over 900 miles away and after 7 p.m.
and that MCI customers ``might have had better luck calling Mars''
than trying to reach MCI for an explanation of their bills.
   AT&amp;T ``maliciously attacked MCI's honesty and the value of MCI's
competing services by falsely and deceptively representing that
AT&amp;T was superior to its competitors in general, and MCI in
particular, in terms of trustworthiness, quality and price,'' the
suit said.
   MCI itself is known for aggressive advertising, such as showing
people fainting when they see their non-MCI long-distance phone
bills. But McGowan said MCI now is being outspent 8-to-1 by AT&amp;T in
advertising.
   He said he could not estimate the losses MCI had suffered as a
result of AT&amp;T ads, but he said ``it's substantial.''
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said, ``We welcome the opportunity to
discuss who is misleading whom and will do so in a countersuit. ...
We have been concerned about MCI's sometimes misleading print and
broadcast advertising and have complained about it directly to
MCI.''
   He said AT&amp;T attorneys sent a letter to ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN
this month complaining that MCI was stretching facts in ads that
claim ``MCI always saves you money over AT&amp;T, month after month''
and that every week 100,000 AT&amp;T customers switch to MCI.
   AT&amp;T said the ads are false and asked the networks to stop
running them.
   Linnen said ABC and CBS had replied that they would look into
the matter, but NBC and CNN had not yet responded to the letter.
   ``AT&amp;T stands behind its advertising,'' Linnen added.
   MCI complains in its suit about AT&amp;T statements that non-AT&amp;T
companies provide slow telephone connections, that other companies
don't operate worldwide like AT&amp;T and that competing 800, facsimile
and WATS services are inferior.
   The suit asks the court to stop AT&amp;T ``from making false or
deceptive representations that any AT&amp;T service is materially
superior to any competing MCI service in terms of quality or lower
cost, or that MCI has misrepresented its services or rates to
consumers.''
   It also asks a judge to force AT&amp;T to stop advertising for 12
months unless ``such information clearly and conspicuously
discloses a court-approved corrective notice that mitigates the
lingering effects of the misrepresentations described therein.''
   MCI also wants the profits ``wrongfully amassed by AT&amp;T on the
sale of its products or services during the period in question,''
plus interest and legal fees. The suit does not put a price on
those profits.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: John Sununu, the White House Disciplinarian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu is the
chief disciplinarian of the Bush White House, the one to whom top
officials get sent when they misbehave.
   President Bush, with the image of being kinder and gentler by
far than his staff chief, rarely chews out members of his team
directly, according to White House insiders.
   Instead, that's the job of Sununu, the former three-term New
Hampshire governor with a reputation for managing with a firm hand.
   Sometimes, when more than just a mild chastising is needed, the
punishment is doled out in two parts: Sununu talks to the errant
official privately and White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater lets
the world know about it.
   The most recent official to be so admonished by Sununu was
former Education Secretary Bill Bennett.
   Bennett, currently the national drug policy director, had
suggested at last month's education summit in Charlottesville, Va.,
that some sessions among governors had been full of ``pap and ...
stuff that rhymes with pap.''
   Fitzwater duly relayed Sununu's words of wisdom to the
independent-minded Bennett: ``Thanks for your comments; they
weren't helpful.''
   ``I think Bennett's probably gotten the message,'' Fitzwater
said, thereby making sure that Bennett did get the message.
   It was the same as the one-two reprimand dished out in March to
White House counsel C. Boyden Gray. He had publicly raised
questions about the wisdom of a Central America compromise reached
with Congress and negotiated by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III.
   Fitzwater said Gray had met with Sununu and ``they had a polite
discussion about how things work in the White House.''
   White House sources, who insisted upon anonymity, said other top
administration officials who have received similar courses in ``how
things work'' in the White House include:
   _Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J. Derwinski, for announcing
the government would not appeal a federal judge's decision on Agent
Orange without first clearing it with Budget Director Richard
Darman.
   The ruling, striking down restrictions on benefits, likely will
result in more U.S. compensation for Vietnam-era veterans exposed
to the defoliant.
   _Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner, who was admonished
not to ``fly alone'' in making decisions on a Dutch airline's
participation in the buyout of Northwest Airlines.
   _Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and Skinner again, who were
brought in and told to stop bickering over turf battles in Alaskan
oil spill cleanup efforts.
   And Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, soon after he was sworn in,
rapidly learned that freelancing wasn't a trait that won points
with Sununu.
   Although it's not known what Sununu might have told Cheney
privately, the chief of staff was quick to publicly repudiate
Cheney's forecast of eventual failure for Kremlin chief Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   In becoming White House disciplinarian, Sununu ``is just
assuming a role that has been one of the traditional functions of
the chief of staff,'' said a senior White House official who works
with Sununu and didn't wish to be identified for that reason.
   ``He's the one to keep people in line, and he's very good at it.
He's not one you'd want to cross,'' the official said.
   Andrew H. Card Jr., a Sununu deputy and loyalist, said, ``Most
people outside Washington don't understand that the White House
takes on the personality of the chief of staff more than it takes
on the personality of the president.''
   Sununu's management style became an issue during the post-mortem
pronouncements on what went wrong during last week's failed coup
attempt in Panama. Critics have claimed a lack of coordination
between the White House and other national security agencies
contributed to the chaos.
   Reports of a rift between Sununu and National Security Adviser
Brent Scowcroft resurfaced _ friction that White House sources say
intensifies whenever Sununu wanders into Scowcroft's realm.
   Former President Reagan, too, sometimes used his chiefs of staff
to administer rebukes to top officials.
   For instance, it was James Baker, chief of staff in Reagan's
first term, and not the president who actually took then-budget
director David Stockman to the ``woodshed,'' according to
Stockman's account in his 1986 book ``Triumph of Politics.''
   Stockman, in trouble for telling a magazine interviewer he had
grave misgivings about Reagan's economic policies, wrote that he
wasn't scolded by Reagan in the Oval Office meeting _ but urged by
a moist-eyed Reagan to stay on.

<HEAD>NBC's Deborah Norville Says She Didn't Violate News Guidlines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NBC news anchor Deborah Norville says her taping
of non-broadcast ``interviews'' of business executives during a
paid appearance in February didn't violate the network's news
guidelines.
   ``My understanding was that I would be interviewing some
marketing people, which I did do,'' Norville said Tuesday of the
appearance at a Philip Morris corporate sales presentation in
Hawaii.
   Norville, whose moonlighting at the conference first was
reported in this week's Newsweek magazine, said the interviews
weren't done for NBC and simply were part of the conference.
   ``But the format was more involved than that, as I discovered
when I got there,'' she said. She said she hadn't expected the
format prepared for her might put her in a position of seeming to
endorse some products.
   When she realized there was a problem, she said in a phone
interview, she tried to make the best of ``an awkward situation.''
   ``I rewrote everything they had prepared for me to say,'' she
said. ``I just said, `Look, I can't say these things.' And I made a
point of rewriting everything so that nothing I said could be
construed as an endorsement.''
   In retrospect, the network would not have let her appear at the
sales conference, said NBC News president Michael Gartner.
   ``None of us understood the format (of her engagement) until it
was too late,'' he said.
   ``Had we understood what was involved or expected of Deborah, we
would not have done it. And clearly it's something we wouldn't do
again,'' he said in a prepared response to a query about the paid
appearance she cited.
   Norville, who since Sept. 5 has been news anchor of the
``Today'' show, was anchor of ``NBC News at Sunrise'' when she got
the invitation to appear at the sales meeting. She was given
permission to accept by Gerry Solomon, then executive producer of
``Sunrise.''
   NBC News guidelines say that staff members considering
invitations to speak, lecture or make personal appearances ``should
use their judgment to avoid being placed in a situation in which
they may be used for any purpose.''
   Norville, who declined to say how much she was paid, said she ``
certainly didn't accept the engagement with any thought that I
would be violating any guidelines, and I don't believe that I did.''
   However, she conceded, ``it was a difficult situation. And I was
there, and I had to be as graceful about it as I could, yet try to
be mindful of what my responsibility as a journalist is. It was a
difficult rope to walk and I tried to walk it as best as I could.''

<TEXT>
   Four men believed to be illegal aliens
were found dead Tuesday in a railroad trailer marked with skulls
and a danger warning, and authorities tried to determine if a
pesticide used on the flour inside contributed to their deaths.
   The Border Patrol was investigating to determine if smugglers
put the men in the trailer, said Border Patrol agent Brian French.
   The four apparently were asphyxiated, said Victoria police Lt.
Jack Williams. Autopsies were to be performed by the Travis County
Medical Examiner's office in Austin, police said.
   Authorities also were investigating the death of a fifth found
alongside railroad tracks in Sinton, where the train stopped
earlier en route to Victoria. Investigators believe the death is
related to the other four.
   San Patricio County Sheriff Leroy Moody said it's possible the
man died in the same railroad car and fell out.
   ``They put a hole in the roof about the size of a half dollar.
Apparently one of them had a buckle knife he used to poke the
hole,'' Williams said, adding the hole probably was made for
ventilation.
   Anne Cuddeback, an investigator with the Texas Department of
Health's hazard communication branch in Austin, said the fumigant
used in the trailer, loaded with flour, could be fatal if inhaled
or injested.
   The trailer was piggybacked on a railroad flatcar. A sticker on
the trailer door showed skulls and said in English and Spanish:
``Danger. This trailer is being fumigated.''
   ``It's quite possible there was enough of the fumigant around to
kill the guys,'' Ms. Cuddeback said. The fumigant can cause nausea
and vomiting, she said.
   Ms. Cuddeback said the fumigant is ``really very, very nasty.
The effects to (men in the trailer) could be pretty awful'' if it
was inhaled.
   Three emergency medical service workers and seven Victoria
police officers later were taken from the scene to a Victoria
hospital. Some of the officers complained of nausea and vomiting,
but the others were just under observation, said police Lt. Richard
Jones.
   The victims' bodies were found by a Southern Pacific car
inspector after a railroad worker noticed the door was open on the
40-foot trailer, normally part of a tractor-trailer rig or
18-wheeler.
   The victims appeared to be in their 20s, said Victoria police
Lt. Richard Jones. Three of the four had papers, although police
hadn't verified the documents Tuesday. One had a Mexican passport,
one had documents from Honduras, and a third had papers that had
been stamped in El Salvador but indicated he was from Venezuela,
Jones said. He said the fourth man did not carry any identification.
   French said the Border Patrol is working through the Mexican
consul to identify the men.
   Police said the train left Harlingen on Monday evening,
overnighted in Sinton, and continued on early Tuesday to Victoria,
a town of about 50,000 people 125 miles southwest of Houston and
200 miles northeast of Harlingen. The morning was cool, with
temperatures at Victoria in the mid-50s.
   The trailer was half filled with boxes of corn flour called
masa, used for tortillas.
   The masa had been fumigated with ``Phostoxin,'' an aluminum
phosphate pesticide used against rodents and insects, before the
trailer was sealed and loaded on the train in Harlingen, said Jorge
Trevino, quality control manager for the flour producer, Azteca
Milling Co. in Edinburg.
   He did not know exactly when a contractor had treated and sealed
the trailer, but Azteca traffic manager Gonzalo Garcia said the men
must have broken into the trailer after it was put on the train.
   Victoria police Sgt. John Burney said symptoms caused by the
pesticide ``are diarrhea and vomiting, which they found inside the
car.''
   Tuesday's discovery was the latest in a series of incidents
since 1980 in which illegal aliens died after crossing into the
United States.
   On July 2, 1987, 18 Mexican men suffocated after a smuggler
locked them inside a railroad boxcar that was later parked for
hours in the desert sun east of El Paso. The men had crossed the
border and entered the Missouri-Pacific freight yard at El Paso.
   One man survived by punching a breathing hole in the boxcar
floor with a spike.
   Since then, border agents have saved dozens of illegal aliens
trapped in similar situations.

<HEAD>Starting Monday, Shrimpers Not Using Turtle Devices Face Stiff Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gulf Coast shrimpers are looking to President
Bush for a last-minute reprieve from regulations they claim will
cost them nearly a third of their income.
   Unless Bush intervenes, shrimp fishermen will face stiff fines
next week if they are caught without devices in their nets that
prevent the drowning of endangered sea turtles.
   The Texas Shrimp Association predicts quiet compliance with the
law, but executive director Ralph Rayburn also says shrimpers could
lose up to 30 percent of their catch at a time when earnings are
banked to get them through the non-productive winter months.
   Congressmen from the Gulf Coast say shrimping is an endangered
industry that cannot afford to use the turtle excluder devices, or
TEDs.
   ``You're beginning to see less shrimpers than less turtles,''
says Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, who has watched the number of
shrimp-industry employees in Port Isabel, Texas, fall from nearly
3,000 to fewer than 400 in six years.
   Ortiz and Rep. Billy Tauzin, D-La., say fuel and insurance costs
for the shrimpers have been mounting as prices have been driven
down by shrimp imports, which now account for 75 percent of U.S.
consumption.
   Although shrimpers have been required to use TEDs since Sept. 8,
the federal government has forgiven the penalties _ at first in
whole and later in part _ if a shrimper bought and installed a TED.
   Sunday, however, is the last day for such reprieves. On Monday a
shrimper found in violation of the law faces an $8,000 fine. A
second offense could result in a $15,000 fine and a third offense
could cost $15,000 and the confiscation of the shrimper's vessel,
catch, or both.
   That's unless Bush, who agreed to review the matter, intervenes
in the long-fought battle between environmentalists and shrimpers
over the use of TEDs.
   The issue is now before John Sununu, the White House chief of
staff, said Tauzin.
   Tauzin says he's expecting penalties and angry shrimpers if the
law isn't modified, but hopes there won't be a repeat of earlier
blockades of Gulf Coast shipping channels by protesting shrimp
fishermen.
   Tauzin believes shrimpers could lose up to 50 percent of their
catch as crews inexperienced with the devices search for
ever-scarcer shrimp. A 10 percent loss in catch is enough to put
some shrimpers out of business, he said.
   Government scientists have found losses from TEDs can range from
5 percent to 10 percent, or even less, but those demonstrations
were conducted with crews experienced in using TEDs, Rayburn says.
   Conservationists argue shrimping is the single greatest cause of
turtle mortality and that TEDs are the best prevention.

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 riot police swinging batons
and firing water cannon broke up a demonstration outside a jail
early today, and at least 64 people were injured, protest leaders
and police reported.
   Police said 15 people were arrested but provided no further
details of what appeared to be one of the most violent incidents
since demonstrations were made legal after martial law was lifted
in 1987.
   ``Riot police launched water cannons at us first. They then
wielded clubs at the unarmed crowd,'' said protest leader Yang
Chu-chun. ``I saw at least 20 people with head injuries in a nearby
hospital, and we estimated at least 50 people were wounded''
seriously.
   In a statement, Taipei County Police said 14 police were hurt in
the melee.
   The demonstration began Tuesday, on Taiwan's National Day, when
10,000 people rallied outside the Tucheng jail in a Taipei suburb
to demand the immediate release of prominent dissident Hsu
Hsin-liang.
   The protesters, wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellow
flowers, shouted ``Release Hsu Hsin-liang,'' and vowed to sleep
outside the jail because they were denied permission to meet with
Hsu.
   About 3,000 protesters remained past midnight. The fighting
began at 3 a.m. today when riot police moved to disperse the crowd,
which broke up after a two-hour clash.
   Police claimed the demonstration was illegal because protest
leaders did not apply for permission and said breaking up the
sit-in was designed to avoid violence. The statement said Hsu's
wife was among the arrested.
   Hsu, 48, was jailed after he returning from the United States
last month, making the final portion of his journey in a fishing
boat from China. The government accuses him of helping organize a
1979 anti-government demonstration in the southern port of
Kaohsiung.
   Protest leaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only at
demanding more political freedom and that a retrial was necessary.

   A combination of high-tech devices,
armed patrols, alligators and rattlesnakes should keep anti-nuclear
demonstrators from reaching the space shuttle Atlantis' launch pad,
security officials say.
   ``I wouldn't want to get into the number of officers, but you
can be assured ... that we feel we have adequate people to take
care of any situation,'' said Gary Wistrand, deputy director of
Kennedy Space Center's security office.
   Wistrand's comments Tuesday came in response to statements by
anti-nuclear activists that they would try to infiltrate the launch
pad if a federal judge failed to block the liftoff.
   In Washington Tuesday evening, U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch
ruled that the launch could go ahead because the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration had complied with the
requirements of the National Environmental Protection Act.
   Attorneys for the Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice tried
to block the launch of the shuttle and the plutonium-laden Galileo
Jupiter probe on safety grounds.
   ``We're sad because the court didn't rule in our favor. But on
the other side, we feel like we've succeeded in bringing the issue
to the public, that they are plannning to put nuclear power in
space,'' Bruce Gagnon, the group's coordinator in Florida, said
after the ruling.
   Gagnon said protesters plan to follow through with their
intention to block the launch by putting people on the launch pad.
   Wistrand said his force, armed with M-16 assault rifles and 9mm
semiautomatic pistols, is prepared to find and arrest anyone who
attempts to get onto the 140,000-acre space center.
   ``We're concerned by all aspects whether it's by land, by plane
or by boat, but I think the most likely way is by foot,'' Wistrand
said.
   The swampy areas around the launch pad limit the lanes of
approach, Wistrand said.
   In demonstrations two years ago, about 20 people were arrested
on space center property, he said.
   ``What we found is that because of the swamps, which include
alligators, rattlesnakes and wild hogs, they (demonstrators) mainly
want to stay on the high and dry land,'' he said. ``It made it
fairly easy to detect and arrest these people.''
   Besides the additional patrols and monitoring devices, the
security perimeters have been moved to the outer gates, the
adjoining Banana River has been closed to boats, and helicopters
with infrared scanners fly over the area.
   The Coast Guard has several boats in the ocean offshore to
enforce the security zone.
   On launch days, the Federal Aviation Administration provides
chase planes to protect the airspace above the shuttle.
   Though Wistrand refused to divulge how many men are on duty at a
time, he has a force of 200 to 225 security guards.
   ``We've had a number of demonstrations in the past and we've
successfully handled those and each time we've made a number of
arrests,'' Wistrand said.
   More than 20 anti-nuclear activists used various means to get in
at the space center and Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in January
1987 to protest the test-firing of a Trident 2 missile.

<HEAD>Cheney Complains of Congressional Interference in Panama Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional limits on covert action thwarted
the Bush administration in its handling of the Panama crisis, says
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who faults lawmakers for interfering
in the White House effort.
   The former Wyoming congressman spent much of last week on
Capitol Hill defending the administration against charges it
mishandled the abortive coup against Panamanian dictator Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   In an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press, Cheney took
the offensive, complaining lawmakers' involvement in an area
``really not their bailiwick'' undercut the executive branch's
ability to deal with the crisis.
   ``We had situations here where members of Congress were
literally calling agencies downtown, or even people in Panama, as
these events unfolded, demanding information. That creates all
kinds of problems,'' Cheney said.
   He declined, however, to name any names among his former
colleagues.
   The defense secretary, who served in the House for more than 10
years, said that although members of Congress have legitimate
oversight roles, ``they ought to refrain from trying to intrude in
the process while it is still unfolding.''
   Adding to the problems of congressional interference were the
comments made by lawmakers based on information that was usually
``a small piece of the total picture,'' and in some cases,
inaccurate, Cheney said.
   They ``certainly complicate our lives when they run out and make
public pronouncements in front of the press, knowing only half of
what there is to know,'' the defense secretary said.
   As an example, Cheney cited the assertion that Noriega was
offered to U.S. officials.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., repeatedly has contended that was the
case, although Cheney and other administration officials say
they've found no evidence that such an offer was ever made.
   Questioned about clashes this past weekend between the
administration and members of the Senate over restrictions on
covert action, Cheney said officials have been handcuffed in their
ability to act.
   ``There's no question in my mind that we've reached a point
where it is a complicated business to try to function in this
area,'' he said. ``There's complications that have developed over
the years because of various and sundry rules and restraints.''
   Choosing his words carefully after expressing concerns about
divulging classified information, Cheney described a hypothetical
situation in which the United States, learning about a planned
coup, assesses those involved and their strategy as well as
positions its forces.
   ``You can't really do that without congressional approval. These
days it's very difficult to get that,'' Cheney said.
   On the defense budget, Cheney said he would recommend a
presidential veto if House and Senate negotiators produce
legislation that gives inadequate financing to strategic programs
such as the B-2 stealth bomber and adds money for weapons Cheney
has proposed canceling.
   Asked about calls from congressional Republicans that the
administration take a stand on an acceptable budget total for the
Strategic Defense Initiative, Cheney said the Pentagon was seeking
the $4.5 billion approved in the Senate version of the defense
authorization bill.
   He conceded, however, the total may not be possible given the
current negotiations with the House, which approved $3.1 billion of
the $4.9 billion Bush requested. ``It's not a matter of our
dictating a particular number and saying this is has absolutely got
to be.''
   Responding to warnings from Capitol Hill that a fleet of 132 B-2
bombers at an eventual cost of $70 billion is impossible, Cheney
fired back that if Congress had accepted the budget he proposed in
May there would be no problem in funding the program.
   ``We showed them how to do it,'' he said, referring to his
proposed funding for the strategic programs and cancellation of the
Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft, and the Navy's
F-14D Tomcat jet fighter. Congress is looking to restore the two
conventional programs.

<HEAD>Congressional Leaders See Gramm-Rudman Cuts Coming</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional leaders believe their dispute
over the capital gains tax cut pushed by President Bush is
virtually certain to trigger the Gramm-Rudman law's automatic
spending cuts next week.
   Their assessment came Tuesday after House and Senate leaders of
both parties failed again to unravel their differences over the
proposed capital gains tax reduction.
   The argument has delayed Senate debate on a related $14 billion
deficit-cutting bill. Unless that legislation is passed by Monday,
automatic cuts in many defense and domestic programs _ expected to
total about $16 billion _ will take effect.
   ``You're not going to avoid'' the cutbacks, Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said after a nearly two-hour private
session. ``I think we're all pretty much in agreement on that.''
   Dole met in the Capitol with Senate Democratic Leader George
Mitchell of Maine, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and
House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   Mitchell said he believed the chances of avoiding the
Gramm-Rudman reductions are ``extremely remote.''
   The air of defeat has arisen because of the complicated dispute
that has tied up congressional leaders for the past week.
   Republican senators are preparing to force the chamber to vote
on a plan to lower the capital gains tax in an effort to honor
Bush's campaign pledge for a cut in the rate. Bush says a rate cut
will stimulate economic activity and boost federal revenues.
   Democratic leaders oppose the idea, arguing it would cost the
government billions of dollars in the long run.
   But the Democratic leadership is on the defensive, realizing
that most senators favor some capital gains reduction, and so they
are trying to reach an agreement with the GOP that would prevent a
capital gains amendment _ and other controversial issues _ from
being added to the deficit-reduction bill.
   Attaching capital gains language to the budget bill _ considered
an urgent, must-pass measure _ would greatly increase prospects for
a cut in the tax rate.
   Each party has been seeking parliamentary arrangements for
voting that would give them procedural advantages in any floor
votes.
   The House also complicated matters last week when it approved an
$11 billion deficit-slashing bill of its own. That measure included
a two-year capital gains cut, a shrinkage of Medicare benefits for
extremely ill elderly patients, an expansion of federal day care
programs and other initiatives.
   Working out a way to pare those items from the legislation _ and
for the House and Senate to agree to a compromise bill _ makes it
all but impossible to finish the task by next Monday, leaders
concede.
   ``The time to have stripped the bill down ... was before we
enacted it,'' Foley told reporters.
   The Gramm-Rudman cuts will be triggered Monday if the projected
deficit for the 1990 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, is not below
$110 billion.
   The Congressional Budget Office projected Tuesday that the
shortfall will be $141.3 billion. This would call for cuts of $41.3
billion, divided evenly between defense and domestic programs.
   The CBO projections, however, are merely advisory. The White
House's Office of Management and Budget issues its binding
projections Monday. They are expected to require about $16 billion
in cuts, divided equally between defense and domestic programs.
   Congress, as it has done in the past, could undo any cuts with
future legislation.

   One Canadian school district is selling condoms
in high school bathrooms and another will start soon in programs
health experts hope will help guard against unwanted pregnancies,
AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
   ``They've been installed for two or three weeks,'' says Loretta
Nichols, chairman of the Qualicum School Board of Trustees in
British Columbia. ``There's been absolutely no vandalism ...
There's been much less concern among the students than there is
among the adults.''
   Qualicum, a semi-rural district on Vancouver Island, placed the
condom vending machines in one boys and one girlrs room in each of
its two secondary schools, which some 1,100 students attend.
   ``We've had excellent family-life programs in place prior to
this,'' Mrs. Nichols said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
   The Toronto school board voted 15-3 recently to install condom
vending machines in its 38 secondary schools in a program that
could begin by Christmas.
   Students in Toronto are being taught that the best method for
preventing AIDS is abstention but that condoms can cut the risk
significantly.
   The decision was made after Dr. Perry Kendall, Toronto's medical
health officer, reported 47 known positive tests for the AIDS virus
among local teen-agers between the ages of 15 and 19. He estimated
that there may be as many as nine more positive tests for each one
known.
   Jim Brown, spokesman for the U.S. Public Health Service in
Washington, D.C., said he knew of no high schools in the United
States that provide condom-dispensing machines.
   ``You would have problems in the local communities, etc.,
etc.,'' he said by telephone.
   Mrs. Nichols said the decision in Qualicum was made strictly for
health reasons, without being aware the district would be
considered in the vanguard.
   ``We had no idea whether it was done anywhere else in Canada,
and it really didn't concern us,'' she said. ``The board approached
the situation on the basis of health prevention and left the moral
aspect completely aside.''
   The vote was 6 to 1 in favor.
   A major factor was that area pharmacies close at 6 p.m. so young
people might find it difficult to purchase condoms, Mrs. Nichols
said, while life in a small town also might discourage them.
   ``Because we're a small area, it's difficult for a student to go
in to a drugstore and be anonymous,'' she said.
   The machines that sell condoms for 50 cents each (43 cents U.S.)
were installed by a supplier on a four-month trial basis.
   The Toronto district plans to purchase machines for $200 each,
then sell condoms it buys for 18 cents each at a
yet-to-be-determined price. Educational programs are planned for
students, teachers and parents before the machines are installed.
   ``None of us has ignored or downplayed the distress with which
some parents will receive this plan,'' Kendall said during the
debate. ``Yet in this instance, the harm of not acting far
outweighs potential censure.''
   He said that teen-agers consider themselves immune to the
possibility of getting pregnant or contracting a disease.
   Canada had reported 3,040 AIDS cases as of Tuesday.
   ``Encouraging students to buy condoms will not end the misery of
unwanted teenage pregnancies, of the transmittal of sexual
diseases, of teenage abortions,'' Toronto's Globe and Mail
newspaper said in an editorial. ``It will reduce the numbers,
however.
   ``By addressing the issue openly, schools may give some
teen-agers the strength to make protection an issue when
considering sexual intercourse, and the knowledge that at least one
form of protection is readily available,'' it said.
   The decision on condom machines is up to local school boards.
The Scarborough School Board, which has 24 secondary schools in
Toronto's eastern suburban area, decided against installing the
machines.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer.
   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or
syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,
and from pregnant women to their offspring.
   The scientific name for the virus is human immunodeficiency
virus, or HIV.

<HEAD>Congressman Says Ethics Committee Delaying Decision on Gingrich</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The congressmen who filed an ethics complaint
against House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich says the House ethics
committee is delaying a decision on whether to investigate
Gingrich's financial dealings.
   Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., complained in a letter to the
committee that a Chicago law firm hired to recommend whether an
investigation should begin has not interviewed many witnesses who
are willing to testify against Gingrich.
   Alexander said Tuesday he had retained his own attorney to
review the committee's progress following his complaint that
Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, may have violated House rules and
campaign finance laws.
   But, he wrote the committee, it was easier to find evidence
supporting his allegations than to find evidence of an
investigative effort by the committee-hired firm.
   The ethics committee _ formally the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct _ hired Phelan, Pope and John Ltd., the firm that
served as the panel's special counsel in the case against former
Speaker Jim Wright. Wright resigned from Congress in June after the
committee charged him with 69 rules violations.
   Alexander filed an ethics complaint against Gingrich April 11
and amended the document on July 14, but said he has received no
response from the committee.
   The committee denied Alexander's request for information on the
Phelan firm's progress, writing him that House rules prohibit
disclosure of the information.
   The complaint said Gingrich may have violated campaign finance
laws, House limits on outside income and a House rule preventing
acceptance of gifts from those with a direct interest in
legislation.
   Many of the allegations center on Gingrich's formation of a
partnership, including political supporters, to promote the 1984
book he co-authored, ``Window of Opportunity.'' There also were
questions about the use of Gingrich staffers to work on the book.
   Gingrich has denied any violations, although he said last month
that his congressional staff did clerical work on the book. He said
House rules permit such activity as long as the book deals with a
public policy issue, and the staffers work at least 40 hours a week
on congressional duties.

<HEAD>Battleship Captain Complains of Crew</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The captain of the USS Iowa says the Navy
staffed his ship with ``dopers, marginal performers'' and other
low-quality sailors who had been kicked off other ships, according
to a published report.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally complained to the officer investigating
the turret explosion that killed 47 sailors in April that he
believed the ship was ``kind of out of it'' when he took over
command in May 1988.
   The Navy, however, said the Iowa's crew was no worse than any
other ship's crew.
   ``I think the battleship has not been properly taken care of as
far as manning goes in the wardroom (the officers on a warship) or
the enlisted area,'' Moosally told Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, the
chief investigator of the Iowa explosion.
   Moosally said some of the sailors sent to the ship were
``dopers, marginal performers, constant UAs (unauthorized
absences).''
   A transcript of the captain's remarks in the May interview was
obtained by the Navy Times, which published them in its Oct. 9
edition.
   The Navy said its investigation concluded the explosion in the
gun turret was probably detonated on purpose by a suicidal sailor
who was upset at the breakup of a friendship with one sailor and at
another shipmate's rejection of his homosexual advances.
   Milligan asked Moosally why he let sailors with criminal records
and disciplinary problems handle ammunition in violation of Navy
regulations.
   Moosally said he would be hard-pressed ``if I was to disqualify
all the guys I've got on (Iowa) that have problems.''
   ``I've got guys that were kicked out of submarines, kicked out
of SPs (shore patrol) that I've got as gunner's mates,'' the
captain said. ``That's what the Navy sends me.''
   The Navy denied that low-quality sailors and officers were
assigned to the ship.
   The four battleships in the Navy ``get their fair share of the
best and worst,'' Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman, told
the newspaper.
   Adm. L.A. Edney, vice chief of naval operations, wrote in the
Oct. 16 edition of Navy Times that Moosally's remarks were taken
out of context.
   ``The questioning took place quite soon after the tragedy while
both the captain and the Navy were searching their minds for
possible causes and while the grief he suffered could best be
described as an open wound,'' Edney wrote.
   Earlier this month the Navy gave Moosally a letter of caution
for violations of training and other regulations that were found
during the investigation of the explosion. These violations, the
Navy said, had nothing to do with the explosion.

<HEAD>Pentagon Spokesman: Decision Not Made On Editors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Pentagon spokesman says a decision on
whether to replace military editors at the armed forces newspaper
Stars and Stripes with civilians won't be made until an ombudsman
submits a report on the question.
   The comment by Pete Williams came a day after he told reporters
Monday, ``When the current military editors retire, it is our
intention to put civilians in there.''
   But Williams said at a Pentagon briefing Tuesday, ``I'm not
denying anything that I said yesterday. I'm just saying that we do
have an ombudsman and it would be well for me to let him make his
recommendations first.''
   The decision to switch from military to civilian editors would
comply with a recommendation in a report last year by the General
Accounting Office.
   The GAO, assisted by the Society of Professional Journalists,
reported that it found evidence of censorship and improper
management at the government-run daily.
   The GAO recommended the editor-in-chief be a civilian with solid
journalism credentials, rather than a military officer.
   Williams' earlier statement had been warmly greeted by those who
have been pressing for such a change, but it apparently caught the
ombudsman _ former Washington Post editor Philip M. Foisie _ off
guard.
   Foisie, reached in Tokyo, said Williams had ``misspoke.''
   ``I think he got confused,'' Foisie said. ``I'm doing a study. I
haven't made any report yet. A decision of the kind mentioned by
Mr. Williams would not be made until my report.''
   Foisie, who was appointed last summer to help deal with the
allegations of censorship, has been in the Far East for more than
two weeks, visiting bureaus of the overseas paper and investigating
its problems.
   Williams said that even if the changes occur, ``I anticipate
that there will always be a military commander of the newspaper.
Now, how you divide up editorial responsibilities is something that
we're asking Mr. Foisie to advise us on.''
   Although frequently referred to as one newspaper, the Stars and
Stripes is published in two separate editions by largely autonomous
bureaus in West Germany and Japan.

<HEAD>`Chainsaw Massacre III' Edited After X-Rating</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Producers of the blood and gore sequel
``Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III'' hope to chop off
its X rating in the editing room and turn it into an R-rated
massacre.
   New Line Cinema will resubmit the film Oct. 17 in an effort to
win the less restrictive rating from the Motion Picture Association
of America's Classification &amp; Rating Administration.
   ``Some adjustments have been made. They aren't major, but you
just sort of have to play around with the material,'' a studio
executive said Tuesday on condition of anonymity.
   ``Chainsaw III'' follows a young teen-age couple driving through
Texas and their encounter with a cannibalistic clan and an eventual
path to hell.
   New Line planned to release the slaughterfest starring Kate
Hodge and William Butler on Nov. 3.
   The New York-based motion picture association, which issues
movie ratings as a guideline to parents, doesn't discuss reasons
for its ratings decisions or comment on what scene or scenes are
deemed objectionable.
   An R rating lets those under age 17 to see the film if
accompanied by an adult. Only adults are allowed in for movies
rated X, the most restrictive audience category and deemed a
financial death sentence for mainstream movies.
   ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' was released in 1974 by
Bryanston Pictures and was rated R. ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
2'' wasn't submitted to the association for a rating when it was
released in 1986 by Cannon.

   Ratzenberger, who plays Cliff on NBC's sitcom ``Cheers,''
presented a $5,000 check Tuesday to the Vashon Island Kiwanis Club

the money for his 35-mile solo row.
   The actor's only break during the 5 a.m. to 9 p.m. row was a

   Drug traffickers claimed responsibility
for the assassination of two employees of a crusading anti-drug
newspaper and threatened to kill its remaining 11 workers in
Medellin if they don't leave.
   A magazine journalist and four other people also were gunned
down Tuesday in Colombia's cocaine trafficking capital.
   The shootings in Medellin followed 13 bombings in three other
Colombian cities late Monday and early Tuesday _ the most serious
rash of attacks since the country's drug lords went to war with the
government nearly two months ago.
   Last month, a car bomb exploded outside the main officies in
Bogota of the 102-year-old El Espectador newspaper, injuring scores
of bystanders and causing extensive damage.
   In a telephone call to El Espectador, a man said a group called
The Extraditables would kill the 11 members of the paper's Medellin
staff if they did not leave the city in three days, an editor at
the paper said. The staff is composed of journalists, secretaries
and administrative workers.
   The anonymous caller said The Extraditables was responsible for
Tuesday's assassinations in Medellin of the paper's administrator
and circulation manager for the city of 2 million, said the editor,
who asked not to be identified for security reasons.
   Drug traffickers have issued statements under the name The
Extraditables. The country's top cocaine barons fear extradition to
the United States, which seeks to put them on trial.
   In announcing the anti-drug campaign, President Virgilio Barco
put in place emergency decrees restoring an extradition treaty with
the United States and empowering security forces to seize the
property of cocaine bosses.
   Millions of dollars in property allegedly belonging to the
traffickers has since been seized, but only one reputed high-level
drug figure has been extradited to the United States.
   Killed within an hour of each other Tuesday afternoon were El
Espectador's administrator, Martha Luz Lopez, 35, and its
circulation manager, Miguel Soler, 45. Both employees were shot by
unidentified gunmen traveling on motocycles.
   Police said gunmen later Tuesday killed Roberto Sarasty, the
55-year-old director of Cronista Democratica magazine, while he was
walking on a downtown street with another journalist. His companion
was slightly wounded.
   At about the same time, another group fired at a crowd at a bar
in Manrique, a northern Medellin barrio, killing four people before
fleeing. Manrique is a known recruiting ground for ``sicarios,'' or
assassins used by drug traffickers.
   Police said that they not been able to establish the motives for
the killings of Sarasty or the four people in Manrique.
   The El Espectador editor denied local radio reports that the
paper's owner had decided to close the Medellin offices because of
the assassinations and threats.
   However, one of the paper's owners, speaking in Monterrey,
Mexico, at the annual conference of the Inter American Press
Association, said El Espectador may close its Medellin office.
   ``I don't know if we'll be able to continue operating in
Medellin under present conditions,'' said Luis Gabriel Cano, whose
brother, Guillermo Cano, was killed by cocaine traffickers on Dec.
17, 1986.
   Cano also said the paper, founded in Medellin in 1887, may have
to close eventually because of financial problems caused by the
bombing last month.
   A senior El Espectador reporter, asking not to be identified,
said in a telephone interview that none of the paper's 1,200
employees have quit, although many had received death threats.
   The reporter said drug traffickers were trying to destroy the
paper by decimating its staff and that more assassinations may
occur.
   ``Security can't be increased any more. We've already got 50
soldiers guarding our facilities, bodyguards for all our managers
and dynamite-sniffing dogs roaming our halls,'' he said. ``What
else can be done?''
   El Espectador has been a strong supporter of the government's
anti-drug offensive, which began after the assassination Aug. 18 of
leading presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galan.
   In an effort to help the newspaper survive, many U.S. papers
have expressed support through large paid advertisements placed in
the paper.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground against the Japanese yen
Wednesday despite the Bank of Japan's raising of its discount rate,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged.
   The Nikkei Stock Exchange lost 136.28 points, or 0.39 percent,
ending at 35,240.07 points. It had gained 167.00 points Monday.
Stock and foreign currency markets were closed Tuesday for a
national holiday.
   Stock dealers attributed the index's fall to the yen's sharp
decline in earlier trading, as well as the central bank's discount
rate hike.
   The dollar, which opened higher at 144.90 yen, ended at 143.90
yen, up 1.67 yen from Monday's close of 142.23 yen. It moved
between 142.55 yen and 144.95 yen.
   The U.S. currency started to fall in earlier trading after
rumors the Bank of Japan might raise its discount rate, traders
said.
   The Bank of Japan raised its official discount rate by 0.5
percent to 3.75 percent shortly after the morning markets closed
Wednesday, central bank officials confirmed.
   The new rate became effective as soon as it was announced at
12:45 p.m., a bank official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   This was the second increase in the key lending rate this year.
The previous hike went into effect May 30, bringing the rate to
3.25 percent, to stem inflation and strengthen the yen, which has
fallen against the dollar in recent months.
   ``The decision came in consideration of recent currency market
fluctuations, movements in foreign interest rates, domestic
economic trends, consumer prices and the money supply,'' the
central bank said in a statement released after its announcement
Wednesday.
   ``The Bank of Japan hopes the rate hike will stabilize consumer
prices and encourage the continued growth of domestic demand,'' the
statement said.
   Expected increases in interest rates on savings accounts at
banks had not yet been determined, the official added. The rate is
currently at 0.26 percent.

<HEAD>Court Upholds AID's Abortion Restriction Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court has upheld the
constitutionality of an Agency for International Development policy
that denies financial aid to private groups supporting abortions in
foreign countries.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia ruled Tuesday against constitutional
challenges filed by three family planning organizations, two
foreign and one based in the United States, that had sued AID in
1985 challenging the policy.
   The Reagan administration decided in 1984 that it would no
longer contribute to non-government organizations which perform or
promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.
   In 1988, U.S. District Court Judge June Green ruled that the
policy violated the constitutional right of the U.S.-based group,
DKT Memorial Fund Ltd., to associate with the foreign
organizations, based in New Delhi, India, and London.
   The appeals panel reversed Green in a 2-1 decision, while
upholding other portions of her decision favorable to AID.

   The New York Times reported Tuesday that a confidential Bush

Drug Administration for potential new safety regulations.
   The FDA said Tuesday it is asking for information about heat
susceptors, metalized surfaces in the packages of food intended for
microwave cooking. These heat susceptors absorb microwave energy
and become very hot, allowing the food to become brown and crisp.
   Because the susceptors become so hot, the FDA said it is
concerned that other parts of the package, including adhesives,
polymers, paper and components of plastic films, may migrate into
the food at high levels.

   ABC had seven of network television's top 10
programs last week but NBC narrowly rode ``The Cosby Show'' and the
baseball playoffs into first place in the A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   ABC finished within 0.8 point of NBC, and its ``Roseanne'' was
the highest rated program of the week.
   ABC has the contract to carry the World Series between the
Oakland Athletics and San Francisco Giants.
   The last such regional contest in 1985, between the Kansas City
Royals and St. Louis Cardinals, went seven games and was a ratings
winner for ABC. But the A's-Giants contest has the disadvantage of
being on the West Coast.
   That means all the games will have to start two hours before
prime time, at 5 p.m. in their respective cities, so East Coast
viewers can catch the first pitch at 8 p.m.
   ``This World Series is not a regional matchup,'' insisted Jack
O'Hara, ABC's director of sports programming. ``The two teams are
national attractions with very recognizable superstars.''
   ``If ABC called us up and said, `Hey, we don't like this
Oakland-Giants matchup,' we'd take it,'' said Preston Beckman,
NBC's vice president of sports audience research.
   NBC led the three networks for the 68th consecutive week, with
an average rating of 15.2 to ABC's 14.4 and CBS' 12.5.
   The ratings are the percentage of the estimated 90.4 million
homes with television sets in the United States.
   Here are last week's top 10 shows: ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``The
Cosby Show,'' NBC; ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC; ``NBC Monday Night at
the Movies: ``A Cry for Help: The Tracy Thurman Story''; ``Who's
the Boss?'' ABC; ``NFL Monday Night Football, Philadelphia vs.
Chicago,'' ABC; ``Chicken Soup,'' ABC; ``Growing Pains,'' ABC;
``Head of the Class,'' ABC; and ``Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS.
   National League games did better than American League contests
during the playoffs, with the Giants-Cubs matches on Sunday and
Thursday nights tying for 12th place in the ratings. The first game
for the National League series, on Wednesday night, was in 17th
place while the third game on Saturday night was No. 19.
   Two American League games were played in prime time, with the
Tuesday night game between the Athletics and the Toronto Blue Jays
in 36th place and the Friday game at No. 38.
   ``One of the two teams in the American League was a Canadian
team, so you don't have the benefit of two markets in the United
States,'' said Beckman of the lower American League ratings. He
said the American League also tends to draw lower ratings.
   Also during the week, a rare interview with Marlon Brando failed
to lift the sagging ``Saturday Night With Connie Chung.'' The CBS
show tied for 68th place.
   The bottom 10 network shows, from the lowest: ``Championship
Baseball Preview _ American League,'' (Friday night) NBC;
``Saturday Night With Connie Chung,'' CBS; ``Championship Baseball
Preview _ National League,'' (Saturday night) NBC; ``Mr.
Belvedere,'' ABC; ``NFL Live Extra,'' NBC; ``Tour of Duty,'' CBS;
``Championship Baseball Preview _ American League,'' (Tuesday
night) NBC; ``Living Dolls,'' ABC; ``Snoops,'' CBS; ``Primetime
Live,'' ABC.
   In news shows, ABC ``World News Tonight'' tied for first place
with the ``CBS Evening News,'' each with a 9.8 rating. ``NBC
Nightly News'' had an 8.0 rating.

   The widow of a rebel Defense Forces
captain vowed at his funeral to obtain justice for the man she said
was killed in prison after the failed attempt to topple Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``I will shout it to the world until justice is done and the
truth is known,'' Luz Elaine Lorenzo said Tuesday as she dried
tears from her eyes at her husband's coffin.
   She denied rumors that Capt. Nicasio Lorenzo had hanged himself
after the coup attempt Oct. 3. The coroner's report said he died of
asphyxiation.
   At the funeral, she called him ``a very Catholic man, a god to
his children, and they are not going to sully his name.''
   Lorenzo, 36, was one of 27 officers arrested after the coup
attempt. He was an adjutant to former intelligence chief Col.
Guillermo Wong, who was also jailed. Eight rebel officers were
killed on the day of the coup, when troops loyal to Noriega put
down the rebellion.
   The government has denied reports some coup leaders were
executed after they surrendered.
   America Torres de McEnfresh, Lorenzo's mother-in-law, said the
family was told Monday morning by the district attorney's office to
pick up his body at the morgue.
   ``I saw him for the last time on Tuesday morning (Oct. 3),''
Mrs. Lorenzo said. ``He did what he always did. He went jogging,
came back dressed in civilian clothes, very sporty, we kissed and
then he left at about 7:30 a.m.''
   ``He never would have committed suicide,'' she told reporters.
``He was a religious man. He taught us to love God. None took food
here without blessing it first.''
   Also Tuesday, the government took new steps against critics of
Noriega, decreeing after a Cabinet meeting that government
employees who take part in ``anti-government activities'' may be
fired.
   Many government employees were reported to have celebrated and
taunted their supervisors while rebels held the military
headquarters on Oct. 3, thinking the coup had been a success.
   The government also decreed laws Tuesday that freeze wages of
public employees and cancel Christmas and year-end bonuses.
   In another move against a perennial critic, the government
eliminated the Education Ministry's national personnel board, which
assigned teaching positions.
   A communique said the new laws were intended to protect ``the
economy and the national security from the aggression of the U.S.
government the past two years.''
   ``They are repressive measures,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon,
leader of the opposition Christian Democrat Party. ``I think they
are the first steps toward developing a police state.''
   Noriega, in announcing last week that the laws were forthcoming,
said ``here there will be no room for traitors nor jobs for the
traitors,'' an apparent reference to the government employees.
   As chief of the Defense Forces, Noriega is the real power in the
government.
   Also Tuesday, the government said it will send representatives
to the Oct. 23-28 meeting of the Panama Canal Commission's board of
directors in Tampa, Fla. It had boycotted the last two meetings of
the joint U.S.-Panamanian board, saying Washington might bring up
the political conflict between the two countries.
   Since Noriega was indicted in February 1988 on charges of
smuggling drugs into the United States and laundering drug money,
Washington has been applying economic sanctions and other pressures
on Panama to force Noriega out.
   Noriega denies involvement in drug trafficking and claims the
United States is trying to force him out because it wants to renege
on 1977 treaties that cede control of the Panama Canal by the end
of the century.

   In an editorial marking a
major Afrikaner holiday, one of the country's staunchest
pro-government newspapers told its readers to leave apartheid
behind and prepare for ``a new world _ a mainly black one.''
   ``Whether some whites like it or not, a new South Africa is
dawning _ a South Africa in which people of color walk tall,'' said
the editorial in Tuesday's editions of The Citizen, a Johannesburg
daily.
   The editorial was intended as an assessment of the country's
political situation on Kruger Day, a holiday marking the birthday
of Paul Kruger. He led the mainly Dutch-descended Afrikaners into
the Anglo-Boer War against the British in 1899 after becoming
president of an Afrikaner republic in what is now Transvaal
Province.
   ``President Kruger might be bewildered, like may of us are, by
the suddenness of changes that have come or are coming, but he
would know, as we do, that this beloved country has the inner
strength to survive and fulfill its great destiny,'' The Citizen
said.
   ``Apartheid is dying and the right will never be able to
resurrect it,'' the editorial said. ``The black man is coming into
his own and will never be subjected again to pass laws, influx
control or any of the other monstrosities of apartheid.
   ``It is a new world _ a mainly black one _ and there will never
be a way of returning to white domination or white sovereignty.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush has accepted an invitation to
attend a drug summit with the leaders of the world's three largest
coca-producing countries, who pledged all-out war on traffickers
during talks in this desert city.
   The presidents of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, in a five-hour
meeting Tuesday, invited Bush and European leaders to take part in
the summit, to be held within the next 90 days in Latin America.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said: ``The president will go.'' He said 90 days was ``within the
time frame we have been considering. It's reasonable.''
   Fitzwater said the United States had no objection to
participation by Europeans and security concerns would not stand in
the way of a summit. Of a planning meeting Nov. 20, he said: ``I'm
sure that's fine with us.''
   At their meeting, Presidents Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia,
Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Alan Garcia of Peru also questioned
U.S. reliance on military and police actions to stem the cocaine
trade.
   In a brief communique at the end of their session to develop a
common strategy to fight drugs, the presidents said both the
production and consumption of cocaine must be addressed at the
summit.
   They also pledged to continue ``all-out war'' on trafficking.
   In the statement, the presidents said a successful
anti-narcotics campaign must, in addition to seeking punitive
measures against drug traffickers, also deal with production and
consumption of drugs.
   They did not elaborate in their statement. However, Peru,
Colombia and Bolivia have said military-style repression of the
drug trade should be accompanied by more U.S. economic aid to
provide alternative crops or sources of income for the hundreds of
thousands of peasants who grow coca.
   In August, Barco began a crackdown on Colombian cocaine barons,
who oversee the smuggling of most of the cocaine that reaches the
United States. He has received $65 million worth of U.S. military
aid to help in the effort.
   Garcia has urged European leaders to join the war against
cocaine. He has warned that if the United States is successful in
slowing the influx of cocaine, traffickers will shift their focus
to Europe.
   Colombia, Peru and Bolivia are the world's three major
coca-producing countries. Coca is a raw material used to make
cocaine.
   About 300 soldiers guarded Ica's elegant Las Dunas hotel, where
the meeting took place and about 3,000 plainclothes policemen
circulated in this city of 350,000 people 180 miles southeast of
Lima.
   The heavy security was to defend against any attacks by the
leftist Shining Path guerrilla group, which works in alliance with
cocaine traffickers in Peru's Upper Huallaga river valley, source
of most of the world's coca leaf.
   Tuesday's one-day drug meeting was to precede a larger meeting
today of seven Latin American presidents, who were expected to
expel Panama from a regional organization called the Group of Eight.
   A bomb exploded before dawn Tuesday in Trujillo, the northern
Peruvian city where five regional foreign ministers were meeting to
prepare the agenda for the three-day regional summit.
   It exploded at the offices of a public housing agency, damaging
the building but causing no injuries. Police said no group claimed
responsibility.
   In Lima, leftist guerrillas killed a governing party candidate
for a municipal council Tuesday night and rebels set off a car bomb
that wounded one person, police said. There was no claim of
responsibility.
   At today's summit, the leaders of Mexico, Venezuela, Uruguay,
Brazil and Argentina will join Garcia and Barco in Ica to discuss
Central America's conflicts, drug trafficking, foreign debt and
environmental damage to the Amazon jungle.
   They were to debate Panama's membership in the Group of Eight,
which has already suspended Panama from participation to protest
the leadership of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``We cannot permit a country like Panama that scoffs at and
ridicules the democratic system to continue with us,'' Foreign
Minister Guillermo Larco Cox of Peru said Tuesday in Trujillo.

   Along the 10,000-foot ridges of central
Asia's Tien Shan mountains, where few Westerners have set foot,
veterans of the Vietnam and Afghanistan wars shared battlefield
memories and a desire for peace.
   The Americans, most of them former Marines, Special Forces
troops or paratroopers, recalled how fellow soldiers in Vietnam
were killed or wounded by gunfire from AK-47 assault rifles,
supplied by the Soviet Union.
   Soviet veterans, also from elite combat units, offered similar
accounts of how their comrades fell victim to hand-held Stinger
missiles that the United States had shipped to the Afghan rebels.
   ``We talked about that quite openly,'' said Bob Rheault, the
leader of the U.S. group, ``and then we'd think about what would
happen if we started shooting at each other with our own weapons.
   ``We'd end the planet,'' said the retired Army colonel.
   For eight days last month, about 35 U.S. and Soviet veterans
trekked across some of the world's most spectacular and forbidding
terrain in an expedition that reflected the spirit of glasnost, the
Soviet's policy of openness that is responsible for a growing
number of exchange programs.
   Earthstewards Network of Bainbridge Island, Wash., a non-profit,
educational group that seeks to promote citizen diplomacy, had
invited Rheault to lead the expedition and recruit participants.
   A Soviet veterans' group organized the itinerary; the Americans
had no idea of their destination until they arrived.
   ``It was a great adventure,'' said retired Lt. Gen. Hal Moore,
who commanded a 1st Cavalry Division battalion in the Ia Drang
Valley, the landmark 1965 battle between U.S. and North Vietnamese
forces.
   Moore, 67, of Crested Butte, Colo., was surprised at the ease
with which he and the other Americans were accepted by the younger
Soviet veterans. Many of the Americans were a generation older.
   ``They called me their brother, and they wanted me to call them
my little brothers,'' Moore said. ``I thought they might call me
`grandfather'.''
   The route traversed a range of remote and barren mountains that
cuts across western China into the Soviet Union east of Tashkent.
   Despite language barriers _ each group had two interpreters _
and the age differences, the former soldiers forged a common bond,
according to members of the U.S. contingent.
   Attitudes toward the respective wars were strikingly similar,
Rheault said, citing the example of one of the Soviets, who
displayed knife wounds from hand-to-hand combat in Afghanistan. The
Soviets completed their troop withdrawal from Afghanistan earlier
this year.
   ``He was proud of having been a good soldier, but he was not
happy at having been sent to fight that stupid war,'' Rheault said.
   Rheault, a former commander of U.S. Special Forces troops, is no
stranger to controversy. He and five Green Beret subordinates were
arrested by the Army in 1969 on charges of killing a South
Vietnamese civilian who was an alleged double agent. Rheault was
jailed 70 days before the Army abruptly dropped the charges.
   Rheault went on to develop innovative outdoor adventure programs
at the Hurricane Island Outward Bound School in Maine. He said the
Tien Shan expedition reinforced the belief that communication
improves hopes for peace between the superpowers.
   At the end of a day's climb, the Vietnam veterans sang ``Where
Have All the Flowers Gone'' and other songs of the era. The Soviets
shared their protest songs, including the mournful ``Black Tulip,''
which took its name from the helicopter that lifted out bodies of
dead Soviet soldiers.
   ``We had so much in common that it transcended our
differences,'' said the 63-year-old Rheault. ``We certainly felt a
lot closer to each other than any of us felt to our own
politicians.''

   Rock fans and opera lovers were enthusiastic
about the world premiere of an opera written by Stewart Copeland,
the former drummer with the rock group Police. A newspaper review,
though, wasn't so kind.
   The idea of a rock star moving into the opera world is ``very
exciting,'' said 22-year-old Brent Brown, of Painesville, a
longtime fan.
   ``He's bringing new ideas to high opera,'' said Brown, dressed
for Tuesday night's premiere in a tuxedo and red bow tie.
   A companion, David Dunham, 28, also of Painesville, said the
opera ``Holy Blood and Crescent Moon,'' was ``a good mix for new
people. You need that.''
   Dunham, a fan of opera, said that the ``orchestrated score needs
a little work. The actual singing is good.''
   But a reviewer for The Plain Dealer newspaper found problems.
   ``Copeland's score rises only at a few isolated moments to
anything that makes us care about his characters. It is full of
nervous orchestral busy-work,'' the review said.
   Dunham said the capacity audience at the ornate State Theater
included many more young people than the typical opera audience.
``I wouldn't expect to see them here for `Carmen,''' he said.
   Copeland, who spent six years with Police and later wrote scores
for movies and television shows, took four years to write ``Holy
Blood and Crescent Moon,'' a tale of the Crusades in the Middle
East.
   The 37-year-old decided to write an opera on a lark in 1984,
while he was composing music for a ballet for Shakespeare's King
Lear for the San Francisco Ballet.
   His opera will be performed Thursday through Sunday at the State
Theater and in March 1991 in Fort Worth, Texas.

   Jupiter's Great Red Spot is getting
redder following a color change by a 6,200-mile-wide belt of
clouds, scientists said as NASA prepares for the Galileo's six-year
mission to the planet.
   ``This is a dynamical, neat place to look at. It's changing and
doing wild things on a huge scale,'' said Rita Beebe, an astronomer
at New Mexico State University.
   British astronomer G.M. Hurst on July 16 first noticed that
Jupiter's 6,200-mile-wide Southern Equatorial Belt was changing
from brown to white.
   Since then, the Great Red Spot _ a hurricane almost twice
Earth's size that faded to dim grey in 1976 _ has been returning
gradually to its brick red color, Beebe said Tuesday by phone from
Las Cruces, N.M.
   ``The Red Spot appears to be darkening. Color seems to be coming
back,'' said Stephen O'Meara, an associate editor at Sky &amp;
Telescope magazine in Cambridge, Mass. ``Some observe it as orange;
some pink. It has a pale luster.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had hoped to
launch space shuttle Atlantis on Thursday carrying the Galileo
probe into Earth orbit, where it will be deployed on its flight to
Jupiter. But the agency late Tuesday delayed the launch at least
until at least Monday because of a computer problem aboard the
shuttle.
   Scientists study weather on Jupiter and other planets to
understand Earth's climate and rules governing weather on planets,
said Beebe, who watches Jupiter using a 24-inch telescope at her
university's Tortugas Mountain Observatory near Las Cruces.
   Galileo will examine Jupiter's vast storms and jetstream-like
belts when it arrives in 1995 at the solar system's largest planet,
which is 11 times wider than Earth and 318 times heavier.
   The Great Red Spot, which is at least 350 years old and measures
about 12,400 miles east to west and 6,200 miles north to south, is
continuing to get redder and about six months from now ``will
settle down as a beautiful oval red spot,'' Beebe said.
   The darkening is being caused by the changing color of the
Southern Equatorial Belt, which sits just north of the spot, she
said.
   The belt faded from brown to white in the early 1970s, then
turned brown again in 1974, said Glenn Orton, a planetary scientist
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   It appears brown when sunlight hits natural gas, or methane, and
ammonia to create yellow-brown photochemical smog, which drifts
down in Jupiter's atmosphere and absorbs light hitting the
atmosphere, Beebe said.
   She said the belt changes to white when Jupiter's internal heat
pushes enough ammonia ice crystals upward, where winds up to 330
mph spread the crystals out to form a white deck of
light-reflecting cirrus clouds.
   Beebe said that when the belt is brown, eddies in its winds
start feeding ammonia ice crystals into the Great Red Spot, so
white ice washes out the red color.
   When the belt turns white again, the eddies diminish, reducing
the amount of ice entering the spot and allowing it to start
turning dark red, she added.
   During August and September, Orton studied the belt through the
Infrared Telescope Facility, NASA's heat-measuring telescope on
Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano. He found the Southern Equatorial Belt
had cooled considerably, showing icy clouds were blocking heat from
warmer atmospheric gases below.
   Beebe said the belt will turn brown again within about 18 months
as violent storms mix atmospheric gases.

   A Florida city was under up to 3 feet of water early today
following a downpour of 16 inches of rain, while a cold front in
the nation's Northwest brought high winds.
   ``With other storms we've had some warning,'' said St.
Augustine, Fla., police chief George Thornton. ``This one came out
of the clear blue sky, so to speak.''
   Thornton said no evacuations were ordered and no flood-related
injuries were reported. The record amount of rainfall in St.
Augustine lasted 14 hours on Tuesday.
   Out West, a high wind watch was posted this morning for the
northwest Chinook zone of Wyoming and the southeast portion of the
state.
   Strong winds whipped across parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho
and Montana Tuesday afternoon and evening. In western Montana,
winds gusted to 72 mph at Choteau and to 63 mph at Cutbank.
   Ahead of the cold front, afternoon temperatures were near 80
degrees in western Montana, while behind the front temperatures
dropped into the low 60s in central Washington.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended Tuesday evening from western
New York state across eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, West
Virginia, Maryland and western Virginia, as well as over eastern
South Carolina, along the Georgia coast and across Florida. Showers
also were scattered over the Idaho Panhandle.
   Thunderstorms late Tuesday afternoon produced hail as big as
golf balls at Cleveland.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 8 p.m. EDT
included 2.31 inches at Daytona Beach, Fla., and 1.30 inches at
Fort Myers.
   The rain was accompanied by record cold in many parts of the
East. Record lows for the date Tuesday were tied or set in 11
cities in seven states, including new lows of 33 degrees in
Asheville, N.C., and 29 degrees in Hartford, Conn.
   The nation's high Tuesday was 104 degrees at Borrego Springs,
Calif.

   Police found the bound bodies of 80
murdered young Sinhalese men along a road in southern Sri Lanka
today, a day before the final round of peace talks to try to
resolve ethnic conflicts that have claimed more than 16,000 lives.
   The bodies were found along a 20-mile stretch of road between
the towns of Panadura and Mataguma in Kalutara district, 25 miles
south of Colombo, said police officials who cannot be identified
under briefing rules.
   The victims, all between age 18 and 30, had their hands tied
behind their backs before they were shot to death, police said. The
bodies, some of them burning, were found in groups of six or eight,
they said.
   No one claimed responsibility for the massacre, one of the worst
this year. But authorities blamed pro-government death squads
seeking revenge for the murder Monday of three Sinhalese soldiers
in Kalutara district.
   Authorities claimed the People's Liberation Front ambushed the
soldiers while they were on patrol.
   Human rights groups and opposition politicians have alleged that
vigilante groups are killing sympathizers of the front, an
extremist Sinhalese group trying to overthrow the government.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa and his government have denied
the charge and have invited the International Committee of the Red
Cross to monitor their human rights practices.
   The front has been attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government
since the signing of a peace accord in July 1987 designed to give
greater autonomy to the island nation's Tamil minority.
   After Premadasa took office in January, the bloody conflict
within the Indian Ocean island nation's Sinhalese majority
instensified, claiming an average of 25 lives every day.
   More than 5,000 people have died in the past two years in
central and southern Sri Lanka, where most of the country's
Sinhalese majoriy live.
   Another 11,000 have died in the northeast, where most Tamils
live and where Tamil guerrillas have been waging a 6-year-old
battle for a separate homeland.
   The People's Liberation Front espouses Marxism but increasingly
has taken up a banner of ultra-nationalism for the Sinhalese, who
are mostly Buddhists and comprise 75 percent of the country's 16
million people.
   Tamils account for 18 percent of the population and are mainly
Hindus.
   Last month, Premadasa convened a peace conference of 21 of the
country's 27 recognized political parties. Tamil guerrilla groups,
including the largest and most militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam, participated in the meeting. The front, however, boycotted
the talks.
   The conference is scheduled to hold its final round of talks on
Thursday.

<HEAD>Woman Gets Moments With Infant Daughter After Judges Deny Leniency
Plea</HEAD>

   A woman choked back tears to plead for
leniency so she could take care of her baby, but judges sentenced
her to 10 years in prison for her role in an attempted jail escape
and murder-for-hire scheme.
   A manacled Vondia Clary, 33, spent 15 minutes behind bars in
Huntington's federal courthouse with her infant daughter, Reba
Montana Clary, after two judges denied her request to remain free
to raise her baby.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II on Tuesday sentenced Clary
to 10 years and 11 months for her role in an attempted escape and
killing scheme masterminded by John P. McCoy, who was convicted of
planning West Virginia's largest bank robbery, killing an
accomplice and counterfeiting $800,000.
   District Judge Robert Staker gave Clary a concurrent term of
four years and three months on cocaine distribution charges.
   ``It is for that child that I make these sentences run
concurrently,'' Staker said. He also said he would recommend Clary
go to a federal prison near her hometown of Huntington so her
daughter can visit frequently.
   Sentenced along with Clary were her boyfriend, Robert Nance, and
McCoy's son, Kennis. The three and John McCoy were convicted Aug. 1.
   Prosecutors say the four plotted to kill, among others, federal
witnesses lined up to testify against John McCoy, 43, of Slater's
Branch, Ky.
   McCoy was sentenced this summer to life in prison plus 43 years
for robbing the Matewan National Bank's Kermit branch of $286,000,
counterfeiting, killing a federal witness and plotting other
slayings and his escape from the Cabell County Jail, where he was
being held pending trial.
   Their hired gun turned informant. No one escaped and no
witnesses were injured.
   Nance, 43, met McCoy in jail, where he was being held on cocaine
distribution charges. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and
fined $10,000 for the escape plot and murder-for-hire scheme. He
also received 10 years on the drug charges.
   Kennis McCoy, 22, was sentenced to nine years and three months.
Haden said it wasn't necessary for the younger McCoy to inherit the
sins of his father.
   ``I think you were sorely used by your father,'' the judge said.
``That's something he'll have to live with.''
   ``He loved his father too much,'' defense attorney Joseph
Martorella said. ``That's a heck of an epitaph as he faces the
penitentiary, but he loved his father too much.''

   Colombian police and soldiers, working sometimes
in concert with drug traffickers and paramilitary groups, have
illegally killed 2,500 people in 17 months, Amnesty International
said today.
   An additional 250 victims disappeared after being taken into
custody in 1988 and the first five months of this year, and some
were tortured while being held, the international human rights
group said in a report.
   Amnesty said that last year alone, it documented more than 30
group killings in which a total of 350 people died.
   It said local rights groups estimate more than 70 incidents
occurred involving groups of five or more victims.
   Victims have included trade union leaders, human rights workers,
teachers, priests, peasants and, more recently, members of the
judiciary trying to investigate rights abuses, it said.
   Many recent mass killings appear to have been part of a campaign
to eliminate people thought to support opposition parties,
London-based Amnesty said.
   ``Available information on the organization and functioning of
so-called death squads provides compelling evidence that
paramilitary forces form an integral part of a counterinsurgency
program adopted by the Colombian armed forces _ often operating
with powerful drug groups _ designed to eliminate perceived
opponents without recourse to the law,'' the report said.
   In one of the worst cases, it said 43 people, including three
children, were massacred in Segovia, a gold-mining town in
Antioquia province, by heavily armed men who arrived in in pickup
trucks on Nov. 11, 1988.
   Some assailants were reportedly hooded and in camouflage uniform.
   Amnesty said preliminary judicial investigations established
that army and police personnel were directly responsible for
preparing the attack, which was apparently directed at supporters
of the opposition group Patriotic Union.
   It said Colombia's Supreme Court overruled a military court's
claim of jurisdiction and handed the case back to the civilian
court that had been pursuing it.
   A civilian court judge investigating the case is one of several
judges who received death threats in recent months, it said. Other
members of the judiciary were killed, including two civilian judges
investigating alleged rights abuses.
   Amnesty said it welcomed measures by President Virgilio Barco to
combat drug traffickers, but was concerned that ``equally vigorous
measures'' were not announced against members of the armed forces
and paramilitary groups accused of systematic rights violations.
   It said civilian members and supporters of paramilitary ``death
squads'' have declared their intention to continue their activities.
   Amnesty asked Colombia to ensure strict control over all
branches of the police and security forces and take whatever steps
are needed to ensure they act within the law.
   It said that where evidence exists of security force personnel
involvement in rights abuses, perpetrators must be prosecuted and
judiciary officials investigating alleged rights abuses must be
given protection and resources.

   You'd have to wonder about a guy who
claimed he was a CIA spy, a mobster, a doctor, the Army's youngest
major general, Elvis Presley's pal and a hero who rescued scores of
POWs from Vietnam.
   His girlfriend did, and after she checked Robert S. Lyons' story
with the Secret Service, they arrested him.
   Lyons, a 35-year-old Mission, Kan., salesman of water
purification systems pleaded guilty in July to impersonating a CIA
agent and a major general and was sentenced Tuesday to 15 months of
psychiatric treatment.
   U.S. District Judge Earl E. O'Connor said Lyons has ``a history
of falsehoods that can't be substantiated other than through his
words.''
   Lyons' ex-girlfriend, Beth Hannah of Overland Park, said Lyons
was charming, quick-witted, and full of stories.
   ``He was a gentleman,'' she said. ``He always held the door
open.''
   Ms. Hannah, 45, nearly married him, and Cindy Cohen, 35, also of
Overland Park, did. Both suffered financially for believing his
stories and both attended his sentencing.
   ``He was a master of manipulation,'' Ms. Cohen said, ``an
absolute master.''
   ``He would make a tremendous writer,'' Ms. Hannah said. ``It's a
waste.''
   Ms. Cohen recalled, ``Robert was constantly lying. He would go
from day to day, minute to minute, building one story on another.''
   Lyons left the Army as a private, but he wrote an article about
himself in a bogus newsletter.
   The story recounts how General Lyons led a commando team in 1983
to Southeast Asia, rescued 285 prisoners of war and returned with
the remains of 300 servicemen. It said he received two Medals of
Honor and was awaiting a third.
   Ms. Hannah, who knew little of government and the military, said
Lyons laced his lies with enough detail to make them sound true. By
late January, less than a month after they met, she gave Lyons
$1,000 to pay his debts.
   Ms. Cohen met Lyons at a restaurant in 1981. She had arrived
there and saw a former boyfriend with a nicely groomed man who
identified himself as Dr. Pat Lyons.
   In the weeks to come, Ms. Cohen said, Lyons kept making excuses
to see or call her. At such meetings, he would mention that he flew
helicopters, designed vacuum cleaners and sold insurance.
   One day, she said, Lyons came to her house saying he wanted to
come clean: His first name was Robert, not Pat, and his stories
about being a doctor were false.
   He said he had no choice but to lie because he was trying to
protect his real identity as a member of the Kansas City mob.
   Another day, Ms. Cohen said, they drove to a carwash, where
Lyons jumped a track and smashed her Pontiac into a post. He
promised that his insurance policy would pay for the damage and
said the mob had arranged the wreck.
   Ms. Cohen agreed to marry Lyons in 1981 because he said the mob
would leave them alone once he married.
   ``I had to get married because I wanted my family left alone,''
she said. ``I wanted my cake decorating shop left alone.''
   But during 18 months of marriage, Ms. Cohen said, she was forced
to sell her furniture and close her business to appease creditors.
``I was watching my life being destroyed,'' she said.
   Ultimately, Lyons confessed that he had lied about his life as a
mobster. Ms. Cohen threw Lyons out of their house, divorced him and
later had the marriage annulled.
   Hannah said she became suspicious when a neighbor saw Lyons'
resume and doubted his claims. The neighbor called the CIA, where
authorities said they had never heard of Lyons. She then called the
Secret Service.
   During the hearing, Lyons' attorney, John Gerstle, described his
client as ``an individual who has severe problems and enormous
emotional problems.''
   ``This has been a long, trying five months for ... my family, my
friends,'' Lyons said. ``I'm sorry for this episode and the entire
train of events.''

<HEAD>Four Men Found Dead on Texas Train; Fifth Death Believed Related</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities are investigating whether a
man whose body was found near railroad tracks was traveling with
four others found dead in a trailer being carried on a railroad
flatcar.
   The four, thought to be illegal aliens, were found Tuesday
morning on the Southern Pacific train, and authorities were trying
to determine if a toxic pesticide used on the cargo contributed to
their deaths.
   Later, authorities found the body of a man also believed to be
an illegal alien beside the tracks just south of Sinton, 65 miles
south of Victoria, authorities said Tuesday night.
   San Patricio County Sheriff Leroy Moody said it's possible the
man died in the same railroad car and fell out.
   Moody said a crewman on a Union Pacific train spotted the fifth
body about 10 feet from the tracks Tuesday afternoon.
   Autopsies on all five were ordered.
   The trailer, half-filled with boxes of tortilla or corn flour
called masa, had two warning stickers about the size of license
plates taped to the doors. The signs showed skulls and said in
English and Spanish: ``Danger. This trailer is being fumigated,''
and ``Do not enter.''
   The masa had been fumigated with Phostoxin, an aluminum
phosphate pesticide, before the trailer was sealed and loaded on
the train in Harlingen, said Jorge Trevino, quality control manager
for the flour producer, Azteca Milling Co. in Edinburg.
   The pesticides are used on masa shipments to keep the food free
of rodents and bugs. Trevino did not know when a contractor had
treated and sealed the trailer, which measured about 40 feet long,
8 feet tall and 10 feet wide.
   Anne Cuddeback, an investigator with the Texas Department of
Health, said the fumigant used in the trailer could be fatal if
inhaled or ingested.
   The four apparently died of asphyxiation despite punching a
small hole in the trailer, probably for ventilation, said Victoria
police Lt. Jack Williams.
   Three rescue workers and seven police officers at the scene were
taken to a hospital after some complained of nausea and vomiting,
said police Lt. Richard Jones.
   The symptoms of the fumigant are diarrhea and vomiting, which
was found inside the car, said police Sgt. John Burney.
   The victims appeared to be in their 20s, he said. Three of the
four had papers, although police hadn't verified the documents
Tuesday. One had a Mexican passport, one had documents from
Honduras, and a third had papers that had been stamped in El
Salvador but indicated he was from Venezuela, Jones said.
   A Border Patrol agent said the patrol is working through the
Mexican consul to identify the men.
   The patrol is investigating whether smugglers put the men in the
trailer and whether other illegal aliens broke the door open later,
said Brian French, agent-in-charge for the patrol's Corpus Christi
area.
   Tuesday's discovery was the latest in a series of deaths since
1980 after illegal aliens crossed into the United States.
   On July 2, 1987, 18 Mexican men suffocated inside a locked
railroad boxcar. They had come across the border into the
Missouri-Pacific freight yard at El Paso. A smuggler had locked the
men inside the insulated box car that later was parked for hours in
the desert sun at Sierra Blanca, about 90 miles east of El Paso.

<HEAD>Plans For Massive Airport Announced In Bid To Build Confidence</HEAD>
<HEAD>By DAN BIERS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governor today announced plans for a new
airport and port complex costing $16 billion that is designed to
boost confidence in the British colony before China takes over in
1997.
   The two-runway airport, to be built on an offshore island and
landfill, and a new high-speed rail system and six-lane highway
linking it to urban areas will be the territory's largest
construction project ever.
   ``By pressing ahead with such ambitious programs despite the
special pressures which our community has so recently faced, the
government is demonstrating its commitment to Hong Kong's future,''
Governor Sir David Wilson said in his annual speech on the state of
the colony.
   The announcement comes as the government tries to restore
confidence in the territory, which was severely shaken by the harsh
crackdown on dissent in China in June.
   Many residents are concerned about what will happen when the
territory is handed to Communist China in 1997, even though Beijing
has promised Hong Kong can maintain its capitalist system for 50
years and enjoy a ``high degree of autonomy.''
   In addressing those concerns, Wilson said a draft Bill of Rights
that would allow people to seek redress in courts if they believe
their civil or political rights are violated would be ready by July
1990.
   But he did not discuss the increased political tension of recent
days between Hong Kong and China that has exacerbated the
confidence crisis.
   Beijing was angered by the colony's decision last month to allow
a Chinese swimmer who had sought political asylum to fly to the
United States. It retaliated by refusing for the first time to
accept the return of Chinese caught entering Hong Kong illegally.
   The move has sparked fears in the colony of a flood of illegal
immigrants.
   Wilson devoted much of his speech to the massive construction
projects that promise to change the face of this territory of 5.7
million people.
   ``Physically, Hong Kong will have changed almost beyond
recongition,'' he said.
   The centerpiece of the program is a new airport at Chek Lap Kok,
about 15 miles west of downtown Hong Kong, which will replace the
colony's existing airport, famed for a harrowing flight path that
forces approaching aircraft to seemingly skim rooftops of the
crowded Kowloon peninsula.
   The new airport, which should open by early 1997, will operate
24 hours a day and be able to handle 80 million passengers a year.
That is more than three times the maximum capacity of the existing
facility.
   A town for at least 150,000 people as well as industrial and
commercial facilities will be built near the new airport.
   Hong Kong also will construct ``what amounts to a completely new
port on the western side of the territory,'' not far from the
airport, Wilson said. A large breakwater between two offshore
islands will be built to increase sheltered anchorage and a new
shipping channel will be dredged.
   The price of the projects is expected to be about $16.28
billion, Wilson said. Although he did not provide specifics on
financing, the government has more than $8.97 billion in surplus.
   Wilson also mentioned an aggressive land reclamation policy that
will expand the downtown area about 990 feet into the colony's
famed harbor. In addition, the site of the existing airport will be
redeveloped.
   The governor failed to break new ground on political issues such
as bringing democratic change to Hong Kong and giving a segment of
the population the right to emigrate to Great Britain.
   Political commentator Joseph Y.S. Cheng said the speech will
have a ``fairly neutral effect'' on the confidence of Hong Kong
people in the future. ``He has done what he can. What he said has
already been anticipated.
   ``Hong Kong people probably realize that their future is not
determined by these well-written highly diplomatic policy speeches
by the governor, but by the political situation in China,'' he said.
   The speech had little impact on the Hong Kong stock exchange,
widely viewed as a barometer of public sentiment. Stocks fell
slightly in the afternoon.
   Philip Niem, research director at the stock brokerage Hoare
Govett Asia Ltd., said the plan for a new airport had generally
been expected since 1983.
   ``This won't necessarily influence foreign investors. I don't
think it is the key issue. The key issue is still China,'' he said.

   A moderate earthquake shook buildings in
Alaska's capital and woke up residents from Juneau to Sitka early
today. No injuries or damage were immediately reported.
   The quake measured 5.1 on the Richter scale in a preliminary
measurement, said Alec Medbery, spokesman for the Alaska Tsunami
Warning Center in Palmer.
   It struck at about 12:50 a.m. (4:50 a.m. EDT) and was centered
50 miles west of Sitka, about 110 miles southwest of Juneau,
Medbery said.
   ``It was felt widely, all the way from Sitka to Juneau and all
points in between,'' Medbury said. ``There were no reports of
damage but it woke quite a few people up. Buildings shook and it
was enough to wake them up.''
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of 5 can cause considerable damage.

<HEAD>Charlotte Mayor Wins GOP Primary; Birmingham Council Keeps Black
Majority</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Charlotte Mayor Sue Myrick easily won the Republican primary in
North Carolina's biggest city, while Birmingham, Ala., voters
returned a black majority to the city council.
   In a partisan primary delayed two weeks by Hurricane Hugo's
devastation, Charlotte's ballot Tuesday drew only 14,920 voters, or
7.5 percent of those eligible to cast ballots, according to
Elections Supervisor Bill Culp.
   ``We had predicted 8 percent, so it was as bad as we expected,''
Culp said. ``I guess hurricanes and Jim Bakker are all this town
can take.''
   The PTL founder's fraud and conspiracy trial was held in
Charlotte.
   Myrick gathered 5,293 votes Tuesday, to Samuel Elijah McClure's
413. She defeated McClure with 95 percent of the vote two years ago
before taking a 995-vote victory over two-term Democrat Harvey
Gantt.
   Myrick's opponent in the Nov. 7 election will be Democrat Craig
Madans, a political newcomer. He avoided a primary when two-term
council member Al Rousso, the heavy favorite, dropped out because
of illness last month.
   In other municipal elections in North Carolina on Tuesday,
Raleigh voters re-elected three-term Mayor Avery Upchurch. Upchurch
had 13,152 votes to 10,440 for City Councilman Charles Meeker.
   Birmingham, once dominated by whites and the scene of historic
conflict during the early years of the civil rights movement,
retained its black majority on the council.
   In complete but unofficial returns, six blacks, including five
incumbents, were elected from six predominantly black voting
districts.
   In the three remaining districts, which are mostly white, one
white incumbent retained his seat, and two other districts will
hold runoffs in which both opponents are white.
   The district plan has been criticized by whites, who complain
their strength is still too diluted and that there should be
another district where they are in the majority.

   The FBI has joined the
investigation into the vandalism, cross-burning and threats against
a family of Ukrainian Christians.
   The bureau is looking into possible civil rights violations
against Vladimir and Ekaterina Doroshkevich and their eight
children, who resettled in the area two months ago.
   A cross was found burning on the family's lawn Sunday morning
and anti-Russian slogans were spray-painted on the Calvary Assembly
of God Church that is sponsoring their resettlement.
   The pastor, the Rev. Mike Smith, received a telephoned death
threat directed against his family and the Doroshkeviches.
   Lt. James Moeller of the White Bear Lake Police Department said
police are analyzing evidence and, so far, the incidents appear to
be the work of a single person.
   ``It's far too early to theorize, but there's nothing at all to
suggest this is anything more than an isolated incident from an
individual, a misguided individual,'' he said. ``There's nothing to
suggest a group or an organized activity.''
   The harassment that Doroshkeviches have suffered is the first
aimed at any of the more than 10,000 Soviet Christians who have
immigrated to the United States since 1988, said Judi Jankowski of
the Minnesota chapter of World Relief, an arm of the National
Association of Evangelicals.
   On Tuesday, the church received scores of phone calls after news
reports of the harassment and vandalism. Almost all of the callers
voiced support for the church and the emigres, said church
secretary Donna Boyum.
   She said three callers criticized the resettlement of the
Doroshkeviches, who say they suffered religious persecution in
their Soviet homeland and spent 12 years trying to emigrate. More
than 60 callers had a positive message, she said.
   ``We've had offers of donations, food and clothing, people who
want to write notes of support to the family, other churches
putting them on their prayer chain,'' Boyum said. ``People
generally are shocked that anyone would do something like this.''
   The Twin Cities Area Human Rights Coalition planned to hold a
session today allowing representatives of various religious
organizations to speak out against the incidents.
   ``We fear this is an example of the xenophobia that seems to be
occurring in our country, in which some people are threatened by
any kind of difference whatsoever,'' said Carol Wirtschafter,
assistant director of the Jewish Community Relations Council
Anti-Defamation League of Minnesota and the Dakotas.

   Homesickness has prompted the
return of more than 50 East Germans who fled their strict Communist
homeland for the West in the past month, a border official says.
   Nearly 50,000 East Germans have arrived in West Germany since
Sept. 11, when Hungary removed restrictions on crossing its western
border.
   Many refugees cried tears of joy when they arrived, but West
German officials have cautioned that many would face personal
problems as they tried to fit into a new society.
   Wolfgang Schlee, spokesman for Bavarian border police, said
Tuesday that 54 refugees who arrived since Sept. 11 already had
returned and he expected more to do so.
   ``Homesickness is the key,'' he said by telephone from Munich.
``Many of them miss their friends. It's for personal reasons.
   ``In some cases, it's a question of wives, children and parents
left behind, alone or in need of care.''
   He noted that many brought ``only the most necessary things with
them. Most of what they owned was left behind.''
   Speculation has arisen about how the refugees would be treated
if they returned home, but Schlee said he doubted they would face
the harshness of the past.
   East Germany severely punishes what it calls ``flight from the
republic.'' Armed guards, fences and the Berlin Wall are designed
to block escape. Over the years, thousands of East Germans have
been sent to prison after being caught fleeing.
   Official news media in East Germany have given prominence to
statements from those who left and returned after becoming
disillusioned in West Germany. They regulary carry bleak
descriptions of life in West Germany, insisting that unemployment
and housing shortages are rampant.

   Voters cast ballots today to choose local
councils that could reform the city's much-maligned school system
by giving parents a direct say in their children's education.
   ``The bad education system is really crippling the city,'' said
Donald Moore, executive director of Designs for Change, an
education research and advisory group that helped shape the reform
package. ``Whether you have kids in school or not, it's important.''
   Chicago's school system, the nation's third largest with 410,000
students, has had low test scores and high dropout rates. In 1987,
then-Education Secretary William Bennett called the system the
nation's worst.
   Under a reform package passed last year by the Illinois General
Assembly, elections are being held today at the city's 469
elementary schools and Thursday at the 71 public high schools to
take much power out of administrators's hands and turn it over
largely to parents.
   Among other things, the councils will have the authority to hire
and fire principals, develop school-improvement plans and spend
money.
   ``I think people understand the significance,'' Moore said.
``The best indicator of that is that we have 17,000 candidates, and
therefore we will have contested selections for almost all
positions on the councils.''
   Each council will include six parents, two teachers and two
community residents without schoolchildren. School staffs will
elect the teacher members. The 11th member of each council will be
the principal of the school or schools the council oversees.
   A 50 percent turnout among parents with children in schools was
predicted by community activists and others who spent weeks trying
to mobilize residents to participate.
   ``I'm just asking people to take a look at this very seriously
because to go into it for anything other than helping the kids, it
will not work,'' said Mary Guyton-Smith, an AT&amp;T clerk seeking a
community representative spot on the council at Farragut High
School on the city's southwest side.
   Despite fears that politicians and others would manipulate the
elections to favor certain candidates, Moore said election judges
were hired by the school board to make sure the elections are
impartial.
   Project LEAP (Legal Elections in All Precincts), a watchdog
group that monitors regular municipal elections, also agreed to
monitor the voting to watch for improprieties.

<HEAD>Oakland Mayor Plays Down Hostilities After San Francisco Mayor's
Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHLEEN MACLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though San Francisco's mayor won't
be getting all A's from his Oakland counterpart, hostilities were
played down as the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics
prepare to meet in the World Series.
   Still, Oakland Mayor Lionel Wilson wanted to capitalize at a
press conference Tuesday on San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos' recent
remark that there wasn't anything in Oakland he wanted.
   ``He kind of took a potshot at us recently, but I'm willing to
let bygones be bygones,'' said Wilson, beaming in a bright green
A's jacket and cap.
   ``I read this morning that he said he was joking,'' Wilson said,
referring to Agnos' comments. ``Well, it wasn't a good joke, but so
what?''
   He pointed out the Athletics have won the American League
pennant two years in a row and won three championships in the time
it's taken the Giants to just make it into the Series two times.
   ``I appreciate the Giants being in the World Series. I'm happy
for them,'' said Wilson, who reportedly was furious when he first
heard Agnos' disparaging statements about his neighbor on the east
side of the Bay Bridge.
   Wilson's peace-making statements were spoken in the spirit of
the first inhabitants of Oakland _ the Ohlone Indians, a hunting
and gathering people said to have maintained such a peaceful
attitude that they had no word for war.
   But the reality is that the World Series war is on, and so is
the rivalry between San Francisco and Oakland.
   Wilson disclosed that he wrote a letter to Agnos about the
anti-Oakland comments he made last week. Wilson said Agnos called
him about the letter, but he didn't return the calls.
   ``I was too upset, and I think I had a legitimate reason. I've
never said anything to try and diminish San Francisco,'' said
74-year-old Wilson, an Oakland resident since age 3.
   Sensing his ``joke'' about not wanting anything in Oakland had
gone too far, Agnos on Monday called Oakland a ``great city with a
great team and a great mayor.''
   Agnos even said there were a few things he ``wouldn't mind
winning'' from Oakland if Wilson wanted to bet on the World Series.
   ``Sure. I'll go high stakes or low stakes,'' Agnos said. ``If
(Wilson) wants to go high stakes, I'll bet him Candlestick Park
against the Oakland Coliseum. If he wants to go low stakes, I'll
bet him dinner at Flint's Ribs.''
   Wilson said he hoped for a ``friendly wager'' with Agnos on the
Series, which he predicted the A's will win in six games thanks to
their superior pitching.
   He knows a little bit about the sport, having played pro ball
for the California Eagles, a black team in the days of segregated
baseball.
   Before the news conference, Wilson quipped: ``I know what I'll
bet him; maybe I'll have a plastic foot made he can put in his
mouth.''
   At his own news conference in San Francisco, Agnos told
reporters Tuesday that he's won every bet he's made since becoming
mayor, including one on the Super Bowl: ``I want to keep the string
going.''

<HEAD>Stuart Apologizes for `Rather Crass' Flier</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   At least a few buttoned-down, tight-collared
patrons of elite Madison Avenue haberdasher Paul Stuart were aghast
last month when they received, along with their statement, a _ how
to describe it _ a flier.
   ``Come on down and shop around!'' the thing blared, and went on
to offer, if you can imagine this, something called a
``skip-a-month'' payment option for _ and at this point you simply
must suspend disbelief altogether _ people strapped by
back-to-school expenses.
   Paul Stuart Inc. spokeswoman Julie Oddy says the flier was
printed on ``cheap stock,'' with large block letters, and there
were exclamation points in the text.
   Even the color was wrong: ``It was green and white, the color of
money,'' complained Ms. Oddy. ``The whole thing was inappropriate
considering who our customers are and what our image is.''
   The flier's inclusion in the August statement (that is, the
bill) came to Paul Stuart's attention when a customer told a member
of the Grodd family, which owns the store, the easy credit flier
seemed out of character. Three or four other customers also
telephoned in their complaints.
   The fault rested not with Paul Stuart, but with the General
Electric Credit Corp., which provides billing, mailing and
marketing services to Stuart and many other stores, including
Caldor's and Zayre's.
   GE Credit spokeswoman Lisa Van Orden said the flier was designed
for other client stores in an attempt to boost September sales by
allowing shoppers to skip a minimum payment in September. Customers
would, however, be charged interest on their unpaid balance.
   The flier was stuffed in with Paul Stuart bills without the
store's knowledge. When Stuart found out, it fired off a letter to
patrons apologizing for what it termed the ``rather crass flier.''
   The letter blamed the flier's inclusion on a mistake by its
mailing house, and assured patrons: ``We would never consider
addressing you in such a manner.''
   GE Credit admits the mistake, but says the ``skip-a-month'' plan
is popular with some shoppers. Executives at Paul Stuart ``just
don't want to bother their high clientele with those kinds of
marketing tools,'' Ms. Van Orden said.
   In an interview several years ago, Patricia Grodd, daughter of
Stuart owner Clifford Grodd, described that clientele as ``a cross
section of people who have achieved in all areas, most of the top
people in every field.''
   And punctual billpayers, too. Although Stuart stood by its
inadvertent skip-a-month offer, Ms. Oddy says no one took advantage
of it.

   Choreographer Alvin Ailey has quietly resigned
his $80,000-a-year professorship at the City University of New York
following complaints he paid others to teach his classes, the New
York Post reported today.
   ``He showed up once and watched us perform. That was it,'' said
Heidi Worrell, a dance student quoted by the Post.
   Professors and former dance students at CUNY said Ailey paid
other students from his Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater Company
to teach his ballet and modern dance courses.
   Distinguished professors at CUNY must spend some time teaching;
the university forbids the use of surrogate teachers, the newspaper
said.
   Ailey, 58, resigned his position at Borough of Manhattan
Community College, part of the publicly funded city university, on
Sept. 1.
   August Kappner, a spokesman for the community college, confirmed
Ailey had resigned but provided no more detail.
   Ailey was not available for comment, said William Hammond,
executive director of the Alvin Ailey company.

<HEAD>Firemen Shoot at Crowd, at Least 8 Wounded</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cadet firefighters shot at a crowd of attackers in
the capital of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, wounding
at least eight people, an Interior Ministry spokesman said today.
   The confrontation between the cadets and a threatening mob
occurred Tuesday night in Stepanakert in the southern Soviet Union,
said Yuri M. Arshenevsky of the ministry's press office in Moscow.
   He said eight civilians were in critical condition.
   Arshenevsky said the cadets were riding in 19 vehicles and
crossing a bridge into Stepanakert when a mob materialized and
began throwing stones and firing on the passing column. He said the
firefighters were forced to shoot in self-defense.
   But representatives of a pro-Armenian group _ Nagorno Karabakh
is a predominantly Armenian enclave in the republic of Azerbaijan
and the focus of a bloody ethnic dispute _ said the crowd was
non-violent.
   Ashot Manucharyan, an Armenian legislator from the region, said
in a telephone interview from the headquarters of the Karabakh
Committee in Yerevan, the capital of neighboring Armenia, that the
civilians were attracted to the bridge by warning shots fired into
the air by the cadets.
   He claimed one civilian was killed in addition to the eight
wounded.
   The Karabakh Committee has led the campaign for the annexation
of Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenian jurisdiction. Azerbaijanis are
predominantly Moslem and most Armenians are Christians.
   It was not clear if the firefighters also were soldiers, but
troops have been stationed in Nagorno-Karabakh to try to keep the
peace for the past year.
   On Tuesday, leaders of a grass-roots Azerbaijani movement
suspended a rail strike that choked off supplies of fuel, food and
housing supplies to Armenia, a member said.
   ``We decided in a directive to open the railroad to Armenia as
of (10 p.m.),'' Ingilap Aslanov, a member of the People's Front and
of the group's strike committee, said by telephone from the
Azerbaijani capital Baku.
   He said the strike was suspended until Oct. 23 to give Soviet
legislators in Moscow a chance to respond to Azerbaijan's demands
to remove special Kremlin administration of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Soviet troops moved into the neighboring republics last week to
break the blockade that has been strangling Armenia and
Nagorno-Karabakh. About 400 trains with 60,000 cars were reported
idled.
   Most supply routes must pass through Azerbaijan to reach Armenia.
   Official news media said Tuesday that in the previous 24 hours
authorities managed to push 1,748 carloads of supplies through to
Armenia.
   But Deputy Premier Lev Voronin told the Supreme Soviet
legislature that did not include oil products. A fuel shortage has
stranded ambulances and halted harvesting in Armenia's fields.
   Reports said freight arriving in Armenia under military guard
was damaged.
   Aslanov said the Azerbaijan People's Front wanted the issue of
Nagorno-Karabakh taken up by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet,
the country's highest-ranking executive body, but settled for
demanding that the Supreme Soviet legislature review the question.
   If it does not do so by Oct. 23, the People's Front will call a
general strike that once again will include the railroads, he said.
   The People's Front says the rail strike started Sept. 4, but
Armenian officials say the flow of goods by rail through Azerbaijan
dried up almost three months ago.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, opening the fall session of the
Supreme Soviet on Sept. 25, called for firm steps to break the
transportation deadlock.
   After hearing Tuesday from Voronin, the Supreme Soviet once
again called on Armenia and Azerbaijan to end their dispute.

<TEXT>
   The leaders of the coup attempt against Panama's
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had no intention of killing him during
the several hours they held him hostage, a participant told the
Miami Herald.
   The rebel, one of 42 Panamanians flown into Miami this week
after seeking refuge at U.S. military bases in their homeland,
spoke on condition that neither his name nor the location where he
was interviewed be disclosed, the newspaper said today. He said his
troops knew him as Commander Thunder.
   He suggested junior officers who took part in the coup attempt
turned Noriega over to their superiors. He said the rebels had held
Noriega hostage for several hours last week and could have killed
him at any time.
   ``There was no intention at any time to kill the man,'' the coup
participant said.
   Asked why, he said it may have been because a soldier would find
it hard to execute his top commander.
   ``It may have been their military discipline,'' he said.
   In their public proclamations, the rebels said they had staged
the coup to ``retire'' Noriega and five senior colonels of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   Among 42 exiles who arrived in Miami is Capt. Francisco Alvarez,
who was arrested last year for taking part in a March 1988 coup
attempt against Noriega. Alvarez reportedly was released from jail
three months ago.
   The Washington Post reported another of those given refuge was
Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the highest-ranking participant
in the coup to escape capture.
   One of the rebels in Florida said the soldiers feared for their
relatives at home.
   ``Noriega is a beast,'' the man said. ``He won't stop at
anything. He's going to take reprisals against our wives, our
children and our parents back in Panama.''

<TEXT>
   Vaslav Nijinsky's ``The Rite of Spring,'' the
revolutionary ballet that provoked a riot at its Paris premiere 76
years ago, is showing the jaded world of the 1980s that it can
still shock an audience.
   When the Joffrey Ballet presented its revival of the long-lost
Nijinsky masterpiece, set to Igor Stravinsky's jarringly primitive
score, about 50 spectators stalked silently out of the Kennedy
Center Opera House during Friday's opening-night performance.
   Choreographed by the legendary Nijinsky, widely regarded as the
greatest dancer of the 20th century, the ballet received a far more
tumultuous reception at its Theater des Champs-Elysees debut in
Paris on May 29, 1913.
   The audience erupted in catcalls, whistles and bawling animal
sounds when the dancers of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo,
standing hunched and pigeon-toed, began stomping obsessively to
Stravinsky's frenzied rhythms as they carried out the ancient
Slavic ritual of a maiden's sacrifice for the renewal of spring.
   Fistfights broke out, dowagers shrieked and impresario Serge
Diaghilev was pelted with fruit when he stood in the balcony to
plead for order. The uproar drowned out conductor Pierre Monteux's
musicians, and Nijinsky stood on a chair in the wings furiously
shouting cues to the dancers.
   ``The theater seemed to be shaken by an earthquake,'' wrote an
artist who sat in the audience that night. Nijinsky's triumph was,
indeed, an earthquake that shattered classical ballet traditions
and marked the violent birth of modern dance.
   The Joffrey's recreation of the original ``Le Sacre du
Printemps'' (``The Rite of Spring''), which was abandoned after
only eight performances in Paris and London in 1913, had its world
premiere in Los Angeles two years ago.
   It is the highlight of a ``Diaghilev evening'' at the Kennedy
Center, running through Sunday, which also includes Nijinsky's
``The Afternoon of a Faun'' with music by Claude Debussy, and ``The
Wedding,'' choreographed by Nijinsky's sister, Bronislava Nijinska,
to music by Stravinsky.
   ``It was a ballet program to end all ballet programs,'' wrote
Alan Kriegsman of The Washington Post.
   Long a dream of the company's late founder, Robert Joffrey, the
reconstruction and staging of the original ``Sacre'' was the result
of seven years of painstaking detective work by Millicent Hodson,
an American dance historian and choreographer, and Kenneth Archer,
a British art historian.
   After working with Nijinsky's former assistant, Marie Rambert,
in London in the mid-1950s, Joffrey met Ms. Hodson, a graduate
student at the University of California at Berkeley, in 1971 and
encouraged her to pursue her research on Nijinsky and the Ballets
Russes.
   Starting in 1979 with only three black-and-white photographs of
dancers from the original ``Sacre'' production, Ms. Hodson embarked
on a search for scraps of materials to reconstruct the ballet in a
sketch book.
   ``My dream was that it be performed on stage,'' she said.
   In London, she met Archer, who was gathering material for a
biography of Nicholas Roerich, a Russian archeologist and painter
who designed the sets and costumes for ``Sacre'' and wrote the
scenario with Stravinsky.
   Together, Archer and Ms. Hodson traveled to the Soviet Union,
the United States, France, Scandinavia and India, conducting
interviews and collecting memoirs, costumes, sketches and
handwritten notes from the original production. Their professional
collaboration led to marriage in 1982.
   They found an oboist who had played in the orchestra pit on
opening night in Paris, and sketches left by an artist who drawn
ballet scenes in crayon from her seat in the darkened theater. They
interviewed the ballet physician's daughter, then a 13-year-old
girl who sat in the audience and vividly recalled the astonishing
scene more than 70 years later.
   In 1984, they happened upon what Ms. Hodson called ``absolute
gold ... the single most important document of those seven years of
research.'' It was a copy of Stravinsky's rehearsal score
containing Miss Rambert's meticulously detailed notes on the
dancers' movements throughout the 34-minute ballet.
   Archer tracked down most of Roerich's original ``Sacre''
costumes, which had been auctioned in 1969 and were scattered among
museums and private collections from the Soviet Union to Castle
Howard in England to the University of Texas at Austin.
   ``This was a phenomenon of dance that had been lost and never
repeated,'' Ms. Hodson said. ``It was a complex kind of
choreography, a branch that hadn't grown. I wanted to see it
brought back to life onstage so it could continue to grow.''

<HEAD>United States Changes Policy on Driftnet Fishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HOWARD GRAVES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government changed course today and
said it would back Pacific islanders' call for a ban on driftnet
fishing in their waters and on the high seas.
   ``There is a signal change in U.S. policy,'' Thomas A. Reese III
told delegates to the South Pacific Conference in this U.S.
territory.
   On Tuesday, the U.S. delegation, headed by Reese, held off
endorsing a resolution to ban what one delegate called ``this
barbarous form of fishing which should be banned everywhere.''
   Reese, a deputy assistant administrator for the U.S. Agency for
International Development, said he needed to consult with the State
Department in Washington for what direction to take on the
resolution.
   South Pacific nations, the American West Coast and U.S.
territories in the Pacific, including Guam and American Samoa, have
opposed driftnet fishing by Japan, South Korea and Taiwan.
   Driftnetting has been called the ``wall of death'' because nylon
nets up to 30 miles long and 49 feet deep are used to catch tuna.
The nets trap everything, including seals, whales, sharks,
dolphins, turtles and birds.
   On Tuesday, the Japanese consul general to Guam, Masao Wada,
told the delegates that the driftnet issue should be addressed in a
scientific, practical and friendly manner and not through a
unilateral ban. He said Japan plans to reduce its number of fishing
vessels and also will send an enforcement vessel to the region.
   The South Pacific Conference is the governing body of the South
Pacific Commission, which provides socioeconomic programs to
underdeveloped, isolated Pacific island countries and territories.
   The United States, Australia, France, New Zealand and Great
Britain contribute financially to the commission and take part on
an equal basis with the smaller countries and territories at the
conference.
   In making its policy shift, the United States wanted the
resolution applied to only the smaller Pacific islands and to the
American West Coast states. Hawaii was not mentioned.
   But the delegates agreed to include Australia and New Zealand in
the area covered by the resolution at the request of those two
nations.
   Philippe Baude, permanent secretary to the South Pacific and
France's delegate, questioned whether the resolution might violate
international law. He said the commission has no legal jurisdiction
over the waters in the South Pacific.
   Pacific islands affected by the resolution include French
Polynesia, Guam, American Samoa, the Cook Islands, Federated States
of Micronesia, Fiji, Marshall Islands, New Caledonia, the Northern
Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands,
Tonga, Pitcairn Islands and Vanuatu.

   A proposed ban against defacing the American
flag is headed for final action in the House this week, with
Democrats seeking to do the job by statute and Republicans urging a
constitutional amendment.
   Approval would send the proposed statutory ban to President Bush
for his signature, despite his statement last week that he regards
anything short of a constitutional amendment as inadequate.
   The House postponed until Thursday a vote, originally scheduled
for today, on the bill that would outlaw flag defacement by simple
statute. It already approved the legislation, 380-38, on Sept. 12
but in slightly different form.
   Meanwhile, the Senate plans to take up the constitutional
amendment backed by Bush and Republican leaders next Monday and the
House plans to consider that measure afterward.
   The Senate approved the bill on the statute, 91-9, last
Thursday. Before doing so, it made a number of changes and the
House must pass upon them before the measure can go to the
president's desk.
   As approved by the Senate, the bill says, ``Whoever knowingly
mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the
floor or ground or tramples upon any flag of the United States
shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than one
year or both.''
   The maximum fine would be $1,000.
   Federal law already calls for precisely those penalties for
defacing the flag. Supporters of the change say, however, the
current statute would likely be ruled unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court.
   Bush called for an amendment after a Supreme Court ruling in
June that threw out a Texas flag-burning case on grounds that the
state statute was an unconstitutional limit on freedom of speech.
   The wording of the federal statute is similar to the Texas
statute.
   Democratic sponsors designed the latest legislation to ban any
act of flag defacement without considering whether it is part of a
political protest. They hope that will shield it against any court
challenge on free-speech grounds.
   They are trying to head off an amendment they say would limit
freedoms guaranteed under the Bill of Rights in response to an
isolated flag-burning incident.
   Republican supporters of a constitutional amendment, such as
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, contend no statutory ban on flag burning
is likely to pass a court test, regardless of how carefully it is
phrased.
   All but a few Senate Republicans, however, voted for the
statutory ban. Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a critic of both
the bill and the amendment, said some lawmakers probably voted out
of fear that a ``no'' vote would come back to haunt them in
campaigns.
   Metzenbaum and several other lawmakers have said, however, that
the heat over the issue has subsided since it flared over the
summer.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Gets SOS From Charter Boat; Hoax Suspected</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Coast Guard and Navy crews searched the dark
waters of the Gulf of Mexico early today after getting a distress
call about a charter boat sinking with 18 aboard, but officials
said the SOS may have been a hoax.
   ``I'm sinking, and I'm going into the water,'' a man claiming to
be a charter boat captain told the Coast Guard late Tuesday, said
Petty Officer Fred Kephart.
   Seventeen life vests and a five-person raft were available on
the 64-foot fishing boat, the man said, reportedly adding, ``We are
going to abandon ship in 45 seconds.''
   Boat and airplane crews found no sign of the vessel by daylight,
and the Coast Guard received no reports of missing boaters, leading
to speculation the call was a hoax _ especially considering the
number of people supposedly on board, said Petty Officer 2nd Class
Bob Morehead.
   ``In a normal search and rescue operation like this, we get
several calls from family members and friends and other cocnerned
people. We haven't gotten that in this case,'' he said.
   ``There is the possibility that this is a hoax. But we are
operating on the assumption that this is a legitimate call, until
we are confident we have searched the whole area with no sign of a
boat and no report of anyone overdue.''
   The search was centered about 30 miles south of Pensacola Pass,
the entrace to Florida's Pensacola Bay.
   Seas were 3 to 4 feet, winds were 8 mph and the water was around
70 degrees, making overnight survival in the water possible, said
Lt. David McBride of Mobile, Ala.

   Recorded radar indicates the exact point where
the engine of a DC-10 jetliner failed over Iowa farmland in July,
according to a National Transporation Safety Board report.
   A map released by the board Tuesday shows the erratic, looping
flight path of the jetliner over Iowa farmland before it
crash-landed at Sioux City airport on July 19, killing 111 of the
295 people on board. Another passenger died 31 days later from
injuries received in the crash.
   The winding flight path, which spirals tightly downward after a
wide loop, documents the difficulty pilots had in getting the DC-10
jetliner to the airport after losing hydraulic steering control.
   Over one point on the map, small triangles indicate the spot
where the airliner's tail-mounted engine disintegrated, said
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz. He said investigators believe the radar
hits indicate falling engine parts.
   The map was released as a farmer harvesting corn near Alta,
Iowa, found what investigators said may be a key missing engine
part _ a rotor fan disk from a jet engine _ embedded in the ground.
   General Electric Co., the engine's manufacturer, had asked
farmers to be alert for parts that turned up in their fields and
offered cash rewards for their return.
   The pilots, who were using engine thrust to guide the plane,
indicated they could only turn right through most of the landing,
but the map shows they also managed a tight, 180-degree left turn
towards the runway before a final 360-degree right loop, just
before landing.
   The board released nearly 300 pages of material on the crash,
including the radar data and reports on the efforts of flight
attendants to secure passengers before the crash, air traffic
control operations and the performance of systems on the crippled
aircraft.
   The documents do not indicate the cause of the explosive engine
failure that forced the plane's crew to make an emergency landing.
But one investigative team concludes that ``forceful discharge of
fan rotor parts severed or loosened hydraulic lines associated with
all three hydraulic systems.''
   A report on flight recorder data says there is no indication of
a problem with the plane's tail engine before it failed.
   The safety board is not expected to come to a conclusion about
the probable cause of the crash until several more months of
investigation by its staff. Rewards have been offered for missing
engine parts, including a large disk from the tail-mounted engine.
   The recorded radar data provided time, position and altitude of
the airliner, which was on a flight from Denver to Chicago.
   At one point, radar lost the airliner, but digital flight data
from the plane's flight data recorder confirmed a final loop just
before the landing, according to the report.
   A report on survival factors said 76 people died of ``multiple
blunt force impact injuries'' and 35 people died of smoke
inhalation.
   The report said 30 children were aboard the airliner. Earlier,
Iowa State Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Bennett said eight of the
passengers who died were 11 years old or younger and all of those
died of smoke inhalation.

   Tropical storm Dan battered Manila
and southern Luzon Island today with 62 mph winds, killing at least
18 people, injuring 55 and shutting down transport, schools and
government offices.
   Up to 20 fishermen were reported missing after two fishing boats
broke from their moorings and collided early today at a port in
Batangas province south of the capital.
   Nearly 60,000 people fled their homes and sought shelter in
government relief centers, officials said. Damage was extensive in
Manila.
   About 95 percent of the city of more than 7 million people was
without electricity as winds ripped down power lines. Schools in
Manila were closed for the day, as were government offices and
stock markets.
   U.S. Air Force officials at Clark Air Base north of Manila said
Dan knocked out 80 percent of the electricity in the camp's housing
area.
   Dan was the second killer storm to strike the Philippines in the
last week. On Friday, Typhoon Angela roared across the northern
coast of Luzon, killing at least 118 people.
   At Manila's airport, Dan's gusty winds pushed an empty Omani
Boeing 707 into the DC-10 that brought President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad of Bangladesh to the Philippines Monday for a four-day visit.
   A wing of the 707 struck one of the engines of Ershad's plane.
   Dan slammed into Luzon on Tuesday night 210 miles southeast of
Manila, passing just south of the capital before entering the South
China Sea.
   Five of the deaths occurred in the Manila area, four in Laguna
province, four on Marinduque island, two in Cavite province, two in
Bataan province and one in Quezon province.
   In Batangas province, the coast guard said 10 people were
rescued when the two fishing boats collided off Bauan, 50 miles
south of Manila.
   The Office of Civil Defense said up to 30 people may have been
aboard the two vessels, but the coast guard said the figure was
uncertain.
   Utility officials said that by mid-afternoon power had been
restored in about 16 percent of the city. A generator at a suburban
power station caught fire and burned for three hours after the
storm ripped off the roof.
   Philippine Airlines canceled 30 domestic flights from the
capital and international service was disrupted.
   An average of 20 typhoons or tropical storms strike the
Philippines annually.

   Three teen-agers were arrested today in the
beatings of three Jewish college students who said they were jumped
by up to 20 youths.
   Albert Sorrentino, 18, Joseph Guben, 16, and James Hynes, 17,
were charged with assault and civil rights violations in the attack
on the Brooklyn College students as they left a party at a Jewish
student center early Sunday, police said.
   Two victims, Steven Weisburg and Joshua Fogel, remained in
hospitals. Weisburg, 19, was in stable condition after removal of
his ruptured spleen, and also had a broken leg. Fogel, 19, was in
fair condition with a fractured skull.
   A third student suffered minor injuries when he tried to stop
the attack, police said.
   They said they were attacked by 10 to 20 youngsters shouting
anti-Semitic slurs.
   Sorrentino's lawyer, Albert Aronne, suggested one of the victims
started the fight by attacking Sorrentino over a slur actually
shouted by someone else in a crowd drinking beer at a grocery store
nearby.

<TEXT>
   An estimated 30,000 people
marched through this industrial city today to protest apartheid and
honor 20 blacks killed by police during a 1985 funeral procession.
   The march, which stretched for more than three miles, was one of
the largest in a series of protests nationwide since President F.W.
de Klerk announced last month that the government would allow
peaceful mass demonstrations.
   Many of the marchers in Uitenhage wore black arm bands in
commemoration of those who died in 1985, when police fired on
several thousand mourners heading toward this city from the black
township of Langa in a funeral procession for men killed earlier by
police.
   Police were deployed in large numbers along the parade route and
blocked off side streets with barbed wire, but no disturbances were
reported. Nearly all the marchers were black, but some were white
or mixed-race.
   Three clergymen heading the parade presented a petition to a
police commander containing demands of the marchers, including
improved services and schools in Langa, lifting of the state of
emergency and release of political prisoners.
   Marchers help aloft banners of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement and placards with slogans, including
one which said: ``Don't Shoot Us. We March For Peace.''
   Uitenhage, a stronghold of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party,
is in eastern Cape Province near the coastal city of Port Elizabeth.
   Police said today that 40 people were arrested for violence
during a mass protest Tuesday in Mpumalanga, a black township in
Natal Province. An estimated 10,000 to 15,000 people attended a
rally there demanding that national police units be withdrawn and
be replaced by police from the tribal homeland of KwaZulu.
   Mpumalanga has been one of townships hardest hit by violence
arising from a three-year power struggle between supporters of
militant anti-apartheid groups and members of Inkatha, a more
conservative Zulu political organization.

<HEAD>California Politicians Propose Major Environmental Initiative</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Environmentalists and top state Democrats
have unveiled a ballot proposal to phase out cancer-causing
pesticides, ban new oil drilling offshore, set up a spill cleanup
fund and protect California's ancient redwoods.
   The sweeping Environmental Protection Initiative, proposed on
Tuesday, would also create an elected statewide office of
environmental advocate to enforce the law.
   The proposal was outlined by gubernatorial candidate Attorney
General John Van de Kamp, other Democrats and several environmental
groups.
   Sponsors have five months to gather the 372,178 signatures
needed to put it on the 1990 ballot. Analysts give the measure a
strong chance of passing.
   ``The point of the initiative is to end what we consider to be a
decade of environmental neglect and begin a decade of environmental
action through programs for preserving a clean ocean, clean food,
clean atmosphere and a clean government,'' said Assemblyman Tom
Hayden.
   Advocates say it would protect food by phasing out
cancer-causing pesticides by 1996 and requiring improved chemicals
by 1997.
   The measure would protect the coast with tough standards for
discharge of pollutants and require sewage plants to meet federal
clean water standards by the year 2000.
   A $500 million fund for prevention and cleanup of oil spills
would be established, and the initiative would allow drilling
leases within the three-mile state limit only in a national energy
emergency.
   It also would create a $300 million bond program for acquiring
and protecting California's ancient redwoods.
   The measure was drafted with help from such groups as the Sierra
Club, the California League of Conservation Voters and the Natural
Resources Defense Council.
   ``By supporting this initiative, California voters will be
making a personal commitment to the planet,'' said Lucy Blake,
executive director of the conservation voters league.
   She said the measure would restore the state to ``its rightful
place'' at the forefront of the environmental protection movement.

<TEXT>
   Just as the abortion battle intensifies in the
courts and statehouses, some political observers and population
experts say the issue is bound to become an irrelevant relic,
overtaken by technology.
   They say the ``abortion pill'' in growing use in France
inevitably will reach America, legally or illegally, and forever
change the argument: women who want abortions will have them
without having to visit clinics, possibly without doctors _ and
maybe even without knowing whether they are pregnant.
   To anti-abortion forces, the French pill is a cloud on the
horizon. It comes as the Supreme Court faces another opportunity to
overturn its 1973 decision that legalized abortion and as Florida
legislators meet in the nation's first special session on abortion
since the high court in July gave states additional power to
regulate abortions.
   ``People on either side of the argument are spending a lot of
energy and emotion on a political issue that's going to be
defused,'' says Leonard A. Cole, who teaches in the Science,
Technology and Society Program at Rutgers University in Newark,
N.J. He has looked into the likely political consequences of an
easy-to-use, at-home abortion pill.
   Werner Fornos, president of the Population Institute, says
RU486, the French pill, ``will make the entire issue moot. It will
take the judgmental community out of play.''
   Fornos says if the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade and
turns the abortion question back to the states, that's likely to
intensify the infiltration of RU486.
   ``This would become the newest of illegal substances that would
readily find themselves in the U.S. marketplace,'' he says.
   The anti-abortion community's leaders acknowledge that the
French pill will divert their energies to new fronts _ to keep the
drug from being smuggled into America, from being approved by the
Food and Drug Administration and from being manufactured by U.S.
pharmaceutical houses.
   They already speak of boycotts of any drug house that seeks to
conduct research on the abortion pill.
   ``Our position is very clear and I think the drug companies are
very aware of it,'' says Richard D. Glasow, education director of
the National Right to Life Committee, the largest anti-abortion
group.
   ``Based on the evidence that we have before us, we don't think
it's going to come into the United States either legally or
illegally,'' says Glasow. ``It's against the law, it's dangerous
for women to take and nobody is going to give it to women.'' He
says medical liability laws will make doctors refuse to oversee its
use.
   Cole, however, draws a comparison with the birth control pill.
   Efforts were made to enforce laws to prevent the sale and use of
birth control devices until the birth control pill came into
widespread use, he says, and at that moment the battle against
contraception effectively ended.
   And he says a society that could not keep liquor out during
Prohibition and cannot keep tons of cocaine from crossing the
border will not be able to prevent people from smuggling in a pill
whose use is legal and considered safe and useful in France.
   Anti-abortion leader Gary Bauer, former domestic policy adviser
to President Ronald Reagan, says keeping RU486 illegal is crucial
to the anti-abortion movement, even though ``certainly if it is
illegal there will be people who use it.''
   The abortion-inducing RU486 was developed by Etienne-Emile
Baulieu. One year after its introduction, he says it has been given
to 25,000 women in France with a success rate of 96 percent. In
some instances, a second pill must be taken, and Baulieu says
medical supervision is called for.
   Nonetheless, he said last week that the pill can ``give more
privacy to the decision of pregnancy interruption.''
   RU486 is a synthetic chemical that, when taken within the first
seven weeks of pregnancy, induces an abortion by causing the uterus
to shed the egg.
   Its French manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, citing anti-abortion
opposition and a threatened boycott, withdrew it from the French
market on Oct. 26, 1988, but resumed distribution two days later
under the direction of the French government, whose health minister
called the drug ``the moral property of women.''
   The French firm is not seeking to sell licenses to market the
drug in the United States and no application for testing is before
the Food and Drug Administration.
   But the National Organization for Women and the Fund for the
Feminist Majority predicted last summer that RU486 ``will come
within this country in the next two to five years,'' adding: ``The
question is whether it will come legally, and therefore be
administered safely under a doctor's supervision, or illegally,
with increased risk for women.''
   Says Wayne Barden, vice president of the Population Council,
``What the anti-abortion people are afraid of is that if it were on
the market no one would ever know how many abortions there were.
Often a woman wouldn't be aware that she was pregnant. She would
miss a menstrual period and take a pill. And that's what takes the
pill out of politics.''

today.
   Deputy Secretary John E. Robson, who is in Tokyo this week,
delivered Brady's letter to Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto inviting Finance Ministry and other Japanese government

   ``The United States government has made drug-money laundering

government to mount a unified effort to stop the illicit use of the
global financial system by drug cartel leaders.''
   ``International cooperation is the key to taking the profit out

   In addition to Treasury facilities here, the Japanese will visit
the Internal Revenue Service Computing Center in Detroit and the
Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Ga.
   Robson is in Japan for meetings with Japanese government and
business leaders focusing on long-term U.S. competitiveness as well
as money laundering. He recently headed a U.S. delegation at a

   A former nursing home aide was
sentenced to 20 to 40 years in prison today for helping smother
elderly patients in a pact with her lesbian lover.
   ``Without you, I'm sure this matter never would have been
cleared up,'' Circuit Judge Robert Benson said in sentencing
Catherine Wood, who had pleaded guilty and testified against her
lover.
   In a statement read by her lawyer, Wood said: ``Saying `I'm
sorry' is not enough. Mere words cannot express my feelings of
remorse.''
   Wood, 27, admitted serving as lookout while some of five
patients at Alpine Manor Nursing home in Walker were suffocated by
another former aide, Gwendolyn Graham.
   Wood said the murders were part of a pact the two hoped would
bind their love. She said Graham told her the killings helped her
``relieve tension.''
   Wood pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of murder and conspiracy.
   Graham was convicted last month of five counts of murder. The
defense charged that Wood fabricated the story because Graham had
left her for another woman.
   Graham, of Tyler, Texas, faces a mandatory sentence of life
without parole.
   Wood testified she stood guard outside the room of a 60-year-old
Alzheimer's patient while Graham suffocated her with a washcloth.
She also said she diverted the attention of a supervisor while
Graham suffocated another patient.
   Graham and Wood lived together as lovers at the time of the
murders in 1987. The two broke up later that year. Police began
investigating the deaths after Wood's ex-husband said she confessed
to him.

<HEAD>White House Asking States' Help in Storing Nuclear Waste</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's chief of staff was urging the
governors of seven states today to accept radioactive waste from
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in order to avert a possible
shutdown of the plant next year, officials said.
   The facility near Denver is the nation's only source of
plutonium triggers used in nuclear warheads. Colorado Gov. Roy
Romer has said he will not allow the plant to continue operating if
alternative sites are not found to store the waste by next March.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has said closure of Rocky
Flats would amount to unilateral nuclear disarmament, since the
triggers cannot be made elsewhere.
   John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, was telephoning the
governors of Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Washington today to ask for their help and to
underscore the importance of keeping Rocky Flats open, said Phil
Keif, an Energy Department spokesman.
   ``He'll tell them this is a critical thing, we hope you'll
help,'' Keif said.
   The seven states chosen as possible alternative sites for the
Rocky Flats waste were selected because they already host Energy
Department nuclear facilities, Keif said.
   Some of these states, including Washington, Nevada, New Mexico
and Idaho, already have said publicly they would not agree to take
any Rocky Flats waste, even temporarily.
   The waste is contaminated with plutonium, which remains
radioactive for 240,000 years.
   Also today, Watkins's top aide on nuclear waste issues, Leo
Duffy, was meeting with Nevada Gov. Bob Miller in Carson City to
ask him to drop his already-announced opposition to holding some of
the Rocky Flats waste, Keif said.
   Duffy later was flying to Idaho Falls, Idaho, to make a similar
plea to Gov. Cecil Andrus. Idaho had been storing excess waste from
Rocky Flats, but on Sept. 1, Andrus sealed his state's borders to
further shipments, citing the Energy Department's failure to open a
planned permanent waste dump in New Mexico on time.
   Watkins told Congress last week that the Waste Isolation Pilot
Project, or WIPP, near Carlsbad, N.M., would not be ready to open
before next July 1 at the earliest.
   Watkins said about 250 cubic yards a month of Rocky Flats waste
would have to be stored elsewhere after March in order to meet
Romer's demands while WIPP was unavailable. He suggested then that
he would ask seven states to share the burden of temporarily
holding the waste, while acknowledging that it would be difficult
to persuade the governors.
   Duffy also planned to meet with Romer today in Denver to discuss
the problem, Keif said.
   In addition, Energy Department officials were briefing the
states' congressional delegations on the WIPP repository problems
and the need for alternative storage sites.

   Cambodians in Thailand's largest
refugee camp threatened strikes and refused to unload U.N. food
supplies today after the international organization cut aid to the
camp, a relief official said.
   Aid workers said Tuesday that the U.N. cut some of its food
rations to the sprawling Site 2 camp because food and other
supplies were being diverted to guerrillas fighting inside Cambodia.
   Site 2 is controlled by Khmer People's National Liberation
Front, one of the three guerrilla groups fighting the
Vietnam-backed government in Phnom Penh.
   The cuts meant a decrease of about 20 percent of the total food
aid to the camp, which houses about 140,000 Cambodians, they said.
   But the Cambodian administration of the camp had told refugees
that the U.N. had cut off all aid to the camp, the relief official
said today, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Workers in the refugee administration had refused to unload U.N.
food trucks and hospital staff had threatened to strike on
Thursday, he said.
   ``The (guerrilla group's) tactic appears to be to create
anti-United Nation's sentimemnt among the population,'' he said.
   Some refugees had become hostile to relief workers, and some aid
staff had been verbally abused, he said.
   Although there are more than 100 outside relief workers in Site
2, much of the essential day-to-day work is done by refugees.
   The aid official said the United Nations had insisted the
refugees ensure that international food supplies are not sent to
the guerrillas, or sold on the open market. It had also demanded an
end to military operations carried out from Site 2, he said.
   Relief officials have reported diversions of food, medicine and
other humanitarian aid since the international assistance program
began a decade ago.
   Some officials privately have been especially critical of the
aid being supplied to the communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who
exercise rigid control over the civilians under their control.
   Human rights organizations have cited numerous human rights
abuses at the Khmer Rouge camps, where monitoring of international
aid is far more difficult than in camps of the other two guerrilla
groups.

   Police have arrested a 16-year-old on
charges of planting two bombs that exploded at his high school on
consecutive days.
   Anonymous tips led officers Tuesday night to the home of the
boy, whose name was withheld, Detective Kevin Smith said. Police
searched his home but would not say what they found and gave no
motive for the bombings.
   Detective John Gunter said the youth had no arrest record and
had not been in trouble at school.
   Bombs exploded Monday and Tuesday at 1,200-student Anderson High
School, causing no injuries. Classes were canceled and students
sent home both days. Damage was estimated at less than $800.
   As word of each blast spread, telephoned bomb threats were
phoned to several other high schools in the area of central
Indiana, authorities said.
   Classes resumed without incident today. Principal Horace
Chadbourne said attendance was normal.
   ``Everything's going well,'' said Shelley Drake, assistant vice
principal. ``Students are happy and feel secure, and we're about
the business of education.''
   ``I'm sure it's over. This is a new day,'' she added.
   Ms. Drake said teachers came to school early and patrolled the
halls before class. ``We did that just to let the students know
that everything's fine,'' she said.
   Not all of the students felt safe, however.
   ``It's kind of scary,'' said Jackie Mohler, a sophomore. ``I
feel safer, but one of my teachers told me this usually starts a
chain, so we'll probably have some (bomb threats) today.''
   The teen-ager was arrested at his home at 8:30 p.m. and charged
with two counts of arson and two of manufacturing an explosive
device, all felonies. He was held at a juvenile detention center.
The student made no statement, Smith said.
   At least one other youth was either involved or was aware of
what was happening, investigators said. They are looking into the
possibility of filing charges against him, they added.
   On Tuesday a small pipe bomb exploded about 7:35 a.m. in a
hallway outside the school auditorium, said Charles Petersen, agent
in charge of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Indianapolis.
   Only a few students and teachers were in the building at the
time.
   Earlier Tuesday, Chief Ron Rheam said police would step up
security at the school today. ``I do not fear for any teacher or
student coming to the school tomorrow,'' he said.
   Monday's explosion occurred in a wrestling room below the west
end of the the school's 9,000-seat gymnasium.
   The crudely made device was a small fire extinguisher filled
with gasoline and a smokeless powder, police said. It was placed
atop a heater 15 feet above the floor, Petersen said.
   ``The bombs were placed in areas where there is not heavy
traffic flow, so that the person that's placing the bombs has some
feeling that he does not want anyone hurt,'' Rheam said.
   Prosecutor William F. Lawler Jr. said he will ask the juvenile
court to waive jurisdiction on the bombing suspect. This would move
the state's case into adult courts and mean the suspect could face
stiffer penalties.

   President Bush welcomed Italy's President
Francesco Cossiga to the White House today to discuss issues
including changes in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and ``the
need for unity ... when tensions are easing but the threat to peace
and freedom still exists.''
   Cossiga, in remarks at a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White
House, called for more Western aid to the reform government of
Poland and touched on other areas of sensitivity between Italy and
the Unied States, including Italian aid to leftist Nicaragua.
   At the arrival ceremony, Bush recalled that his first stop in
Europe as president last spring was in Italy.
   ``The road to alliance unity began in Rome,'' he said, referring
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization conference that he
attended on that trip.
   The president said he and Cossiga planned to discuss the reform
movements sweeping Eastern European nations as well as developments
in the Soviet Union and the Western alliance.
   ``We'll discuss alliance issues and the need for unity that is
critical today when tensions are easing but the threat to peace and
freedom still exists,'' Bush said.
   In a lengthy statement, Cossiga noted ``changes in the direction
of democracy which are taking place in Poland, Hungary and the
Soviet Union.''
   Calling for more financial assistance to help the process, he
said, ``I'm thinking in particular of the great Polish nation that
is currently in the throes of serious difficulty in its courageous
attempt to work its renewal and which needs more substantial aid
from us.''
   Cossiga said Italy wants to create ``a new relationship with
Eastern Europe, particularly the countries of the opposite shores
of the Adriatic (Sea) and over the Alps.''
   He also said that Italy will continue its assistance in Latin
America, where the country's aid to the Sandinista government of
Nicaragua is a bone of contention with Washington.
   The three-day official visit is Cossiga's first since assuming
office in 1985.
   Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis, accompanying
Cossiga, is also expected to seek the U.S. views on Eastern Europe,
especially on events in Italy's neighbor, Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
   Former President Gerald Ford, once roundly
ridiculed for declaring ``there is no Soviet domination of Eastern
Europe,'' says he is taking particular pleasure in liberalization
moves there, especially in Poland.
   ``My mother taught me it is wrong to crow,'' Ford wrote in a
column on the op-ed page of today's editions of The Washington
Post. ``But former presidents as well as small boys know no greater
joy than being able to say: `I told you so!'''
   Ford recalled his statement during a 1976 presidential campaign
debate with Jimmy Carter, who went on to defeat him, that ``there
is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be
under a Ford administration.''
   ``I blew it,'' Ford wrote.
   But, he added, ``Reading the verbatim record with 20-20
hindsight in the light of recent developments in Poland and
throughout Eastern Europe, I come out pretty well as a prophet.''
   Thirteen years after he made the statement that angered many
Americans of Eastern European descent, Ford said countries in the
Soviet orbit ``are writing themselves new constitutions, based on
fundamental human rights and freedoms.''
   The former president noted that ``boasting, like lusting, is
best limited to one's heart.''
   So, he added, ``when my friends say, `You know, what you said
about Poland not being dominated by the Soviet Union wasn't so
stupid after all'' I give them a Sphinx-like smile and accept their
(I guess) compliments.''

   Anti-apartheid activists met
with President F.W. de Klerk today to discuss the imminent release
of eight political prisoners and ask him to make more concessions
to the black majority.
   De Klerk met with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev.
Allan Boesak and the Rev. Frank Chikane. The talks were the first
de Klerk has held with militant black leaders since he took power
in August.
   De Klerk's announced Tuesday that the government would free
eight longtime prisoners, including seven leaders of the outlawed
African National Congress. A prison official said the release would
be within two weeks.
   Anti-apartheid activists welcomed the announcement but called
the move insufficent unless the government also frees African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela, legalizes banned
organizations, and lifts restrictions on many black leaders not in
prison.
   ``What is the use of releasing them when we still have a state
of emergency and when our organizations are still banned?'' the
Rev. Allan Boesak asked 4,000 people at a rally at the University
of the Western Cape Tuesday night.
   ``Eight is not enough, with detainees and political prisoners,
including Nelson Mandela, still being held hostage,'' said Boesak,
president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   The government has indicated Mandela may be released within the
next few months.
   Also today, police used tear gas and batons to stop black youths
from entering a sports stadium in the mixed-race township of
Athlone, near Cape Town, where about 3,000 had gathered to
celebrate Mpetha's expected release.
   Police forbade the crowd from marching out of the stadium, and
the youths sang freedom songs before dispersing quietly when they
were told Mpetha had not yet been freed.
   State radio acknowledged in an editorial today that the
prisoners have a constituency among South Africa's black majority
and need to be part of negotiations.
   ``Where Walter Sisulu ... and others are recognized by some
communities in South Africa as their authentic leaders _ and if
they, too, subscribe to democratic and peaceful objectives _ there
is a need for them to be placed in a position where they can make a
contribution to the debate on just how a future South Africa should
look,'' Radio South Africa said.
   Sisulu is the country's most respected black leader after
Mandela.
   Mandela, told of the releases in advance, was with a group of
anti-apartheid leaders at his home on the Victor Verster prison
farm north of Cape Town when state television made the announcement.
   ``Mr. Mandela said he would greatly enjoy his sleep tonight
after all his efforts to secure their release,'' said Murphy
Morobe, a spokesman for the banned United Democratic Front
anti-apartheid alliance.
   He quoted the 71-year-old Mandela as saying to South Africans:
``The people are going to be greatly endowed by the leadership who
are coming out of jail.''
   ``This unexpected turn of events will take the townships by
storm and thousands will welcome them home,'' the Sowetan, the
nation's largest black daily newspaper, said today.
   In Blackpool, England, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher welcomed
the announcement of the releases, calling it ``a major step in the
right direction.''
   De Klerk said the men would be freed ``as soon as the necessary
formalities'' are handled. A prison official said privately the
process can take from an hour to two weeks.
   De Klerk took office in August and, unlike his predecessors,
appears to be in earnest when he says he wants to allow eventual
power-sharing with the black majority.
   Sisulu ran daily operations of the ANC as its secretary-general
in 1949-54, when the government ordered him to resign. He was
sentenced to life in June 1964, along with Mandela and other
leaders of the ANC's internal military wing, for sabotage and
plotting the overthrow of the goverment.
   Mandela's other co-defendants to be freed are Ahmed Kathrada,
60; Andrew Mlangeni, 63; Elias Motsoaledi, 65; and Raymond Mhlaba,
69.
   Wilton Mkwayi, 66, who took command of the ANC military wing,
Spear of the Nation, after Mandela's co-defendants were arrested in
July 1963, is to be released from a life term he received after a
separate trial in 1964.
   De Klerk's announcement also named Oscar Mpetha, an 80-year-old,
partially blind diabetic with one leg who has spent most of his
five-year prison term in the hospital and was due for release next
year.
   Mpetha, the country's oldest political prisoner, was the ANC
leader in Cape province and, during the appeal of his terrorism
sentence in 1983, was elected a co-president of the United
Democratic Front.
   The eighth man, Jafta Masemula, was a member of the outlawed Pan
Africanist Congress guerrilla organization sentenced to life in
1963 for sabotage.

   A Syrian pilot landed his Soviet-made
MiG-23 fighter jet in northern Israel today and the Israeli army
said he was a defector. Syria denied the pilot defected and said he
was forced to land because of a mechanical problem.
   ``This morning a Syrian pilot escaped from Syria with his plane,
a MiG-23, and he landed safely in Israel,'' said Lt. Col. Raanan
Gissin, an army spokesman.
   The pilot landed at noon at an airfield at Megiddo, 57 miles
north of Jerusalem, and was met by Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and the army's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, an army
communique said. Israel radio said the man was being questioned.
   In Damscus, a Syrian official said: ``The plane faced a
technical failure and the pilot was compelled to make an emergency
landing.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The official denied the pilot defected and said the government
has begun contacts with the International Red Cross to secure the
return of the aircraft and the pilot.
   Another Syrian source, also speaking on condition of anonymity,
said smoke was pouring out of the aircraft's only engine. ``It was
so bad that immediate landing was a must. The pilot had no
alternative but to land in the nearest spot he could find.''
   Israeli witnesses to the landing said the plane did not appear
to be in trouble when it touched down.
   Military sources said aircraft was escorted by Israeli planes
before it landed and that bases in the north were put on alert.
   It would be the first defection by a Syrian pilot to Israel. The
neighboring countries have been in a state of war since Israel's
founding in 1948.
   The army identified the pilot as Adel Basem, 34, and said he
flew the aircraft across the frontier in the Israeli-annexed Golan
Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War.
   A witness told a reporter that the aircraft buzzed a row of
houses moments before touching down at an emergency strip near an
air base.
   ``I was so surprised that I followed in my car to see what it
was,'' said a resident of the area who gave his name only as Moshe.
   Israel radio said the plane carried no weapons.
   The radio said the aircraft was an updated MiG-23 with very
advanced electronics. The MiG-23 was believed last updated in 1985.
   Gissin said there were two previous landings by Syrian airmen in
1973, both due to navigational error. The men were later exchanged
for Israeli prisoners of war but their two MiG-17s were not
returned.
   The MiG-23 single-seat, swing-wing fighter bomber is considered
one of the top Soviet jets in use. The aircraft has a range of 530
miles and can carry up to 17,000 pounds in bombs and missiles.
   Arab pilots have defected to Israel twice in the past.
   
   An Iraqi pilot, Munir Redfa, landed in Israel in a MiG-21 on
Aug. 16, 1966, in a mission blamed by Iraq on the Mossad, Israel's
secret intelligence agency. The operation also angered the United
States, which was later allowed to examine the aircraft.
   The first Arab defector was an Egyptian, Hilme Mahmoud Abbas,
who flew a Soviet-built training plane into the country Jan. 19,
1964.
   Military officials promptly hailed today's landing as a boon to
the country's knowledge of enemy Arab war capabilities.
   ``I think in one sentence we can say that this is an important
event for the air force, without a doubt,'' said reservist Maj.
Gen. Mordechai Hod, a former air force commander.
   ``The significance is that the air force can now examine the
plane secretly and test its electronics,'' Hod added in a radio
interview.
   Other commanders noted that the MiG-23 had been used by Syria
during Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon and that it was a mainstay
of Syria's air force, regarded as one of the greatest military
threats to the Jewish state.
   The Syrians have since acquired a more sophisticated aircraft,
the MiG-29, which is the most advanced Soviet-made fighter.
   Israel radio said the MiG-23 was first supplied to Syria after
the 1973 Middle East War, the fiercest confrontation between Israel
and Syria.

   President Bush today called in two key
senators to mend fences in the aftermath of the failed coup in
Panama, while administration officials tried to glean information
from rebel leaders given refuge in Miami.
   Bush summoned Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., the chairman of the
Senate Intelligence Committee, and Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, the
vice chairman, following a week of congressional criticism about
the way the administration handled the abortive uprising.
   The president ``has the highest respect for the judgment and
integrity'' of the two ``and wanted to take this occasion to
reaffirm the close working relationship with Sens. Boren and Cohen
and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence,'' a White House
statement said.
   Also present at the 35-minute meeting, where Bush thanked Boren
for his bipartisan leaderhsip on foreign policy, were chief of
staff John Sununu, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Scowcroft's deputy, Robert Gates.
   Scowcroft and Boren had clashed during televised interviews
Sunday, with the senator saying his committee had given Bush
everything he sought regarding Panama, and Scowcroft disputing that
statement.
   Backing away from Scowcroft's stand, a senior administration
official said today that Boren and Scowcroft talked about the
matter after the interviews and agreed they on the same track.
``General Scowcroft had no disagreement with Senator Boren's
statement,'' said the official, who declined to be identified.
   The official said Boren and Cohen have been cooperative with the
administration on Panama, and today's meeting was intended to
cement the relationship and ``repair any damage.''
   Meanwhile, State Department officials have been debriefing some
of the members of the Panamanian Defense Forces who had tried to
topple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Oct. 3.
   Among the 42 Panamanians the United States flew to Miami on
Saturday was Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the
highest-ranking participant in the coup to escape capture, said one
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Family members of slain coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi also
were in the group, State Department spokesman Rich Sanders said
Tuesday. He would not confirm whether the group included Giroldi's
widow, Adela Bonilla Giroldi, a key intermediary between U.S.
officials and the coup plotters.
   ``These people definitely have good reason to be out of
Panama,'' Sanders said. ``Noriega's proven willingness to use force
against people, murder people, is a matter of record.'' Giroldi was
shot in the aftermath of the coup, by some accounts at Noriega's
own hand.
   In the wake of strong congressional criticism of Bush's reaction
to the coup attempt, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney complained
Tuesday that interference by members of Congress undermined the
administration's ability to handle the crisis.
   Also, an administration official said that Bush, unhappy over
second-guessing about the way the United States handled the coup
attempt, ordered top officials last Friday to put a halt to
internal criticism. ``A lot of it (internal criticism) was coming
from people who didn't have the full picture,'' said the official,
who declined to be identified.
   State Department representatives have been debriefing the coup
participants who were given sanctuary in this country, officials
said.
   Officials in Washington gave few details about plans for the
Panama Defense Forces members who were housed temporarily in a
Miami hotel.
   ``They are coup members and their families,'' White House Press
Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday, adding that revealing
their identities could endanger them. The group was received by the
U.S. Catholic Conference.
   Mark Franken, assistant director of refugee services for the
U.S. Catholic Conference in New York, said his organization assured
the Panamanians their whereabouts would not be disclosed.
   It is expected that arrangements will be made for those who want
to settle in this country, officials said.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service was ready to review
applications for political asylum from the group ``if such requests
are made,'' according to State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler.
   In an interview with The Associated Press, Cheney complained
that during the coup attempt, ``We had situations here where
members of Congress were literally calling (executive branch)
agencies downtown, or even people in Panama, as these events
unfolded, demanding information. That creates all kinds of
problems.''
   Cheney also said some members of Congress made public comments
based on inaccurate information, such as the assertion that Noriega
was offered to U.S. officials.
   However, Fitzwater said, ``We don't have any specific
complaints'' about congressional interference in foreign affairs,
particularly in Panama.
   The Pentagon said there had been dissension among the coup
leaders about how to handle Noriega when he was in custody of the
coup participants on Oct. 3.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said an unnamed officer taking
part in the coup insisted that Noriega should be given to the
United States and argued with Giroldi who ``had no intention,
ever'' of taking that course.

   Cheek-to-cheek dancing has been declared out of
step in the dance halls of Shenzhen, one of China's most open
cities, and elsewhere in the country.
   The Shenzhen Daily, in a report seen in Beijing on Wednesday,
said close dancing, using sexual enticements to attract customers,
and disturbing social order are violations of local entertainment
regulations.
   It said three dance halls were recently closed down and fined
about $540 each for using lewd means to solicit customers.
   The daily said the closures were part of a citywide inspection
and reorganization of Shenzhen's 90 dance halls and teahouses.
   The popular dance spots play a positive role in providing a
fulfilling cultural life for the masses and contributing to the
city's investment environment, the daily said.
   But some, it said, are troubled by poor management and others
have been influenced by ``bourgeois liberalization,'' the trend of
favoring Western liberal thought that is being attacked by the
Communist Party's conservative leadership.
   The dancing apparently is being banned elsewhere in the country,
but it is particularly being enforced in Shenzhen.
   Shenzhen, a special economic zone located near the capitalist
enclave of Hong Kong, is regarded as one of China's most
Westernized cities, and has apparently come under special attention
in the government's campaign against bourgeois liberals.
   The president of Shenzhen University was dismissed for failing
to oppose the pro-democracy student demonstrations in the spring.
   It was not clear how long the ban on cheek-to-cheek dancing had
been in effect in Shenzhen. China's strict arbiters of public
morals generally frown on close dancing and other public displays
of affection.
   Regulations recently seen outside a dance hall in Canton,
another freewheeling city near Shenzhen, warned against ``unhealthy
dance styles'' such as partners nestling close to one another.

   Two Kentucky businessmen today pleaded guilty
to diverting $1.2 million worth of government-surplus cheese to
make frozen pizzas for commercial sale in supermarkets, the Justice
Department said.
   Ricky Kazuo Oshiro and his brother, Cliff Oshiro, pleaded guilty
in federal court in Lexington, Ky., to a 1985-86 conspiracy to
defraud an Agriculture Department program that donates surplus
cheese to feed low-income people.
   A department statement said the Oshiro brothers were supervisors
of a Florence, Ky., plant operated by Sabatasso Foods, Inc., that
had a contract to make pizzas with USDA cheese for school lunches.
The company also made frozen pizzas for sale to supermarkets.
   The brothers admitted to claiming more cheese than the company
needed to perform the contract and using it to make frozen pizzas
for sale in supermarkets, U.S. Attorney Louis DeFalaise said.
   Each defendant could receive a five-year prison term a $250,000
fine. The case was investigated by the USDA's inspector general.
   Sabatasso Foods, which was formerly based in Santa Ana, Calif.,
was purchased by Schwann Enterprises, Inc., of Minnesota in 1986.

<HEAD>Ferre Sticks to His Style</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International fame has not changed Monsieur
Ferre, as the Milanese creator is called since he became designated
designer for the famed French house of Dior.
   He still cuts a modest, bashful figure with his rotund body and
bearded, chubby face as he comes out on the runway for the standing
ovation that greets his collection.
   He seems embarrassed by the lipstick marks left by his models
who vie to kiss him on the runway, and inevitably takes out a
handkerchief to wipe away his tears of emotion at another
successful show.
   Yet this shy man always produces a dynamite collection. His
style is sexy, self-confident and unmistakable.
   The Ferre silhouette puts the accent on the upper body with
broad shoulders and ornate neckline, tapering into a small waist
and narrow hips. He favors see-through fabrics, tight contours and
bold hemlines.
   Ferre's spring-summer 1990 collection, presented Tuesday night
midway through the weeklong Italian ready-to-wear showings, was no
exception.
   It was his first own label show since shocking the fashion world
by accepting Dior's offer, and the crowd was curious to see if he
could successfully divide his loyalties between traditional rivals
Milan and Paris.
   What they found was a Ferre better than ever, light and airy on
the one hand, seductively masculine on the other.
   Thus, bare midriff chiffon see-through blouses are worn under
slick man-tailored suits with large rhinestone and gold buttons. Or
a huge silk corsage of flowers and feathers and bejeweled cufflinks
turns a man-tailored shirt into a feminine item.
   Pants are cut straight for day and night, and they are a dandy's
delight, coupled with an oversized white blouse with a spill of
panels down the front resembling a huge bouquet of napkins and a
straw fedora.
   As the day goes on, Ferre's style becomes more elaborate,
culminating in a series of chiffon floral and paisley printed gowns
richly decorated with gold and crystal sequins.
   Ferre is into heavy gold jewelry, as are many of the designers
in Milan. He adorns his models with enormous charm bracelets with
sea-motif charms, large beaded necklaces and chain belts.
   Among Ferre innovations were the short-skirted summer wicker
work suits woven out of burlap to look like raffia, and a body suit
in bands of gray jersey and skin colored chiffon that looked like
mummy wrappings.
   Another big name to show Tuesday night was Mariuccia Mandelli,
the master mind behind the Krizia label.
   The Krizia collection was young and carefree with an accent on
the 1940s. To the tune of ``In the Mood,'' Krizia showed that by
day she was in the mood for bright colors, short easy shapes and
lots of prim navy blue and white.
   Neat daytime navy blue suits and dresses with crisp white
lapels, alternated with T-shirts adorned with the new Krizia
animal, the giraffe. These were worn over cheerleader shorts in
tropical shades. Two new daytime ideas were jodhpur sweat pants,
and patchwork camouflage leather.
   At night, Krizia indulges in her favorite fabric _ accordian
pleated silk _ for beautiful shawled blouses and wafty
pastel-colored short party dresses.
   Like many of her colleagues this week, Krizia has no trouble
baring the flesh, leaving wide open spaces in the midriff or down
the back. Bras as lingerie seem to be out of fashion, whereas they
take on new life as outer wear, appearing in leather and jersey by
day, and sequin and gold by night. See-through fabrics abound.
   For more than an hour, Krizia's models kept coming out down the
long runway. While reporters simply put down their notebooks,
rowdier photographers shouted ``Basta!'' _ ``Enough!''

   Autopsies indicated four suspected
illegal aliens found dead inside a flatcar trailer were killed by a
pesticide used to fumigate its cargo of tortilla flour, an official
said today.
   Railroad workers found the men Tuesday morning in the open
trailer. It had been plastered with warning signs on its doors
indicating its cargo had been fumigated with Phostoxin, which is
used to keep insects and rodents away from food.
   Travis County Coroner Dr. Robert Bayardo reported signs of
internal bleeding typical of pesticide poisoning, said Justice of
the Peace Sylvia White.
   ``He said one of the guys had some coins in his pocket and those
coins were black, indicating there was poison in there,'' Ms. White
said.
   She said a full toxicology report would be completed later this
week.
   The flour producer said Tuesday the victims had apparently
broken into the trailer after it was fumigated, sealed and loaded
on a flatbed car.
   The men, believed to be aliens from Mexico and Central America,
had been sitting close to the ceiling of the trailer on boxes of
flour piled four to five feet high and had cut a breathing hole the
size of half-dollar in the ceiling, authorities said.
   The body of a fifth man was found near railroad tracks in
Sinton, about 60 miles south of Victoria.
   ``We believe that he was a member of the party that was in this
particular trailer. He may have either crawled out or fell out, but
we don't know positively,'' said Victoria police Capt. Jesse
Ramirez.
   The captain speculated that the victims may have been asleep and
that the fifth man woke up, felt ill and got out.
   Authorities also are trying to determine how the men got into
the trailer, whether it was locked once they got in and how it was
reopened.
   ``The doors can only be opened from the outside, so we're
thinking somebody opened the door, saw them dead and ran off as
quick as they could,'' Ramirez said.
   He also said police talked to four illegal aliens Tuesday night
who were on a different section of the train. During the stop at
Sinton, the four got out of their compartment and walked around,
discovering the four in the trailer and the fifth outside, he said.
   ``But they thought these guys were drunk. They tried to wake
them, but couldn't. So they got back in their own car,'' Ramirez
said. One of the four aliens was later hospitalized in Victoria
after complaining of nausea.
   The trailer, half-filled with corn flour called masa, had two
warning stickers the size of license plates on its doors. They
showed skulls and read in English and Spanish: ``Danger. This
trailer is being fumigated,'' and ``Do not enter.''
   Jorge Trevino, quality control manager for the flour producer,
Azteca Milling Co. in Edinburg, said he did not know when a
contractor had treated and sealed the trailer, which is about 40
feet long, 8 feet tall and 10 feet wide.
   The victims inside the trailer had suffered diarrhea and
vomiting, symptoms of the fumigant, police said. In addition, three
rescue workers and seven police officers were taken to a hospital
after some complained of nausea and vomiting, police said.
   Ramirez said one victim was from the state of Guerrero, Mexico.
Another had documents from Honduras, a third had papers that
indicated he was from Venezuela, and the fourth man carried no
identification, Ramirez said.
   The Border Patrol is investigating whether smugglers put the men
in the trailer, said Brian French, agent in charge in the patrol's
Corpus Christi area.
   Tuesday's discovery was the latest in a series of deaths since
1980 involving illegal aliens who crossed into the United States.
   In 1987, 18 Mexicans suffocated inside a locked boxcar after
coming across the border into a freight yard at El Paso. A smuggler
had locked the men inside the insulated car, which later was parked
for hours in the desert sun.

<HEAD>House Panel Rejects Bill Calling for Quick Refunds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Ways and Means Committee today
rejected a bill that could have resulted in quick refunds averaging
$223 apiece for customers of the nation's utility companies.
   The bill by Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., lost on a 22-13 vote,
with 12 Democrats and one Republican supporting it.
   At issue in the bill, co-written by Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.,
was about $19 billion that the power, gas and telephone companies
collected in advance from customers to pay corporate taxes to the
federal government. The money was collected in anticipation that
the utilities would owe taxes at a 46 percent corporate rate.
   However, when Congress enacted the 1986 tax overhaul, it cut the
top corporate rate to 34 percent. Matsui was able to win passage at
that time of an amendment giving utilities as long as 30 years to
refund the excess to consumers.
   Matsui says now that he made a mistake, that he was misled by
the utilities into believing that the excess would be used to buy
new equipment. Many utilities, he says, are so rich with cash that
they are buying such businesses as golf courses, recording studios
and a drug store chain.
   ``Never before in my 11 years in Congress has an issue been as
crystal clear as this one,'' Matsui said earlier this year when he
introduced the heavily lobbied bill. ``It's a matter of right vs.
wrong, good public policy vs. bad special interests, ethics vs.
greed.''
   His bill would have have given state utility commissions
authority to order utilities to refund the excess over some period
longer than three years.
   There was little debate in the committee before the bill was
rejected. Reps. Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala., and Ed Jenkins, D-Ga.,
argued that forcing quick refunds would cost consumers two or three
times the size of the refund several years down the road.

   For a brief moment, a man was $1 million richer,
until police arrested him on a larceny charge for allegedly running
off with a bag of money that fell from an armored car.
   ``He said he thought it was a bag of laundry,'' said police
Officer Paul Painten, who with an armored car guard arrested the
man Tuesday about 100 yards from where dozens of money bags fell
from a truck onto the Broadway Bridge.
   Painten said the white bag, about the size of a pillow case, was
marked Bank of Boston in black letters. A seal indicated it held
$1,040,000.
   Officials estimated that $5 million in cash was in the bags
being transported by the Berkshire Armored Car Service of
Pittsfield.
   A forklift had to be used to reload hampers of cash bags.
Officials said all the money was recovered.

<HEAD>Consumers Who Order by Phone Get New Purchase Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission voted unanimously
Wednesday to give consumers who purchase items by telephone the
same rights they would have had if they bought through the mail.
   Currently, mail order merchandisers must notify consumers if
they are unable to ship products and goods within the time stated
in advertisments and catalogs.
   If the delay is going to be 30 days or less the buyer has the
option to cancel the order. If the delay is going to be more than
30 days the order is automatically canceled unless the consumer
expressly agrees to the longer delay.
   The FTC action Wednesday extends the rule to the shipment of
merchandise ordered by telephone.
   ``The existing rule has been very popular,'' said Commissioner
Mary Azcuenaga, noting that just one of 34 preliminary comments
received by the commission opposed the extension. That was from the
representative of ``unnamed direct marketers'' she said.
   The proposed rule change would not apply ``to shipments ordered
through use of other, as yet undeveloped technology, but would
include all ordering methods involving direct or indirect use of
the telephone,'' said Azcuenaga. This would include fax machines
and machines produced for the hearing impaired, she said.
   The commission will send a notice of the proposed rule to
Congress and publish notice in the Federal Register, allowing 30
days further comment before the rule can take effect, said
spokeswoman Brenda Mack.

   Linda Nichols could understand why burglars
stole her videocassette recorder, answering machine, jewelry and
cash, but it was too much when they also took the birthday cake she
bought for her twin sons.
   ``It takes a low person to steal a 10-year-old's birthday
cake,'' Mrs. Nichols said Tuesday.
   One of the twins, Dustin, drew nationwide attention three years
ago during fund-raising efforts to finance a liver transplant to
save his life. He had the operation Feb. 8, 1987, and has been
doing well, Mrs. Nichols said.
   In addition to the cake for Monday's birthdays, Mrs. Nichols had
bought skateboards and cashed a check to take Dustin and Damon to
the state fair in Dallas this weekend. The skateboards were stolen,
along with the cash, leaving her with nothing left to buy
replacement birthday gifts.
   ``I'm mad,'' Mrs. Nichols said.

   University of Mississippi freshmen must
take an academic course that covers social issues and tries to
engender an appreciation of cultural and ethnic diversity.
   The university on Tuesday also announced the creation of a
Minority Affairs Council to establish programs and policies to
increase minority participation in campus life.
   A school spokesman said the freshman course should begin in the
fall.
   Earlier this year, members of the school's Beta Theta Pi
fraternity stripped and bound two members, wrote racial slurs on
their bodies and dumped them on the campus of predominantly black
Rust College. The students contended they did not know their prank
had racial overtones.
   The school closed the fraternity for three years, expelled one
student and suspended four others for two years.
   The panel was established following a six-month study by the
Chancellor's Task Force on Minority Participation in Campus Life
and includes administrators, faculty and staff.

<TEXT>
   About 2,000 police drove demonstrators
away from a jail with clubs and water cannons early Wednesday and
at least 28 people were reported injured. The protesters demanded
the release of a dissident publisher.
   Police and opposition leaders said the casualties included 14
officers and 14 members of the opposition Democratic Progressive
Party. A policeman and four other people were reported hospitalized
with serious injuries.
   Protest leaders said they believed many demonstrators did not
report their injuries, and estimated total casualties at about 50.
It was one of the most violent encounters in Taiwan since
demonstrations were legalized two years ago.
   Demonstrations outside the Tucheng jail in a Taipei suburb began
Tuesday, Taiwan's National Day, when 10,000 people gathered to
demand the immediate release of publisher Hsu Hsin-liang, 48.
   Chang Chun-hung, leader of the opposition party, said of
Wednesday's violence: ``The police mercilessly launched the bloody
attack on the peaceful crowd under instruction of the ruling
Nationalist Party. The demonstration would have ended peacefully if
the police did not disperse us with force.''
   On a videotape shown at Chang's news conference, police were
seen firing water cannons and swinging clubs at protesters, some of
whom shouted ``Peace! Peace!'' Chang said police also smashed a van.
   Earlier Wednesday, police arrested 15 protesters who allegedly
attacked them, then released all the detainees on bail. Among them
was Hsu's wife, Lin Cheng-chien, who police said was hospitalized
with serious bone fractures.
   Nationalist Party spokesman James Chu said the opposition should
be held responsible for Wednesday's violence because several
protesters threw stones and attacked police.
   ``They apparently ignored the laws and barely understand that
most people want a peaceful society,'' he said.
   Protesters wearing yellow headbands and carrying yellow flowers
rallied outside the jail Tuesday and said they would sleep there
until they were allowed to meet with Hsu.
   About 3,000 protesters remained past midnight and the two-hour
battle began when police moved in at 3 a.m.
   Police contended the demonstration was illegal because protest
leaders did not apply for permission. They said the protesters were
dispersed to avoid violence and restore the free movement of
traffic.
   Hsu was jailed after his return last month from 10 years in the
United States. He made the last stage of trip on a fishing boat
from mainland China.
   The government accuses him of helping organize an
anti-government demonstration in 1979 Kaohsiung port. Protest
leaders said the 1979 protest was aimed only at demanding more
political freedom.
   The Nationalists fled the Chinese mainland when the communists
won the civil war in 1949 and have governed Taiwan since.

   Music by such groups as the Smoky Mountain
Boys along with demonstrations of such frontier arts as and lye
soap-making are expected to draw thousands to the 10th Appalachian
Museum Homecoming.
   Thursday through Sunday, the museum 16 miles north of Knoxville
will play host to 480 crafts people, musicians, singers, authors
and celebrities for the celebration of Appalachian pioneer life.
   ``So many of the older people look forward to this for literally
months and weeks before the homecoming. They will talk about who
they met for a long time afterwards,'' said museum founder and
homecoming organizer John Rice Irwin.
   For $6 a head, visitors can learn how to make lye soap, corn
shuck dolls and flowers, hickory bark baskets, braided rugs, gourd
items, knives, saws, skillets, glass, brooms and more.
   The demonstrations will be given by people who learned those
skills as part of everyday life, Irwin said.
   ``It is just amazing how rapidly the culture has changed so that
younger folks don't have any idea what their grandparents did,''
Irwin said Tuesday.
   ``So many of the revivalists in the craft business are great
people, but as you would surmise, it's just not the same as doing
it like you have since childhood.''
   The expected 35,000 visitors also can sample freshly made apple
butter, sassafras tea, parched corn, molasses, bread, cream and
butter.
   Music is a large part of the homecoming, including performers
such as Grandpa Jones; Grammy-winning songwriter Jimmy Driftwood,
known for the hit ``Battle of New Orleans''; songwriter, musician
and river boat pilot John Hartford, known for the hit ``Gentle on
My Mind''; Roy Acuff's Smoky Mountain Boys; the Bottom of the
Barrel Bunch and a band called Dismembered Tennesseans.
   The celebration also will feature appearances by regional and
nationally recognized writers such as ``Roots'' author Alex Haley,
who lives nearby.
   The pioneer museum in the hills of eastern Tennessee is a
60-acre collection of original pioneer buildings and paraphernalia.
   Its first homecoming consisted mostly of a few crafts people and
some authors trying to sell books. But word of the annual festivity
spread by mouth and the event grew in attendance.
   ``I don't have a right to stop it,'' Irwin said. ``It would be
like a preacher deciding to disband the church.''

   NASA engineers today reached into
Atlantis' cramped engine compartment in an effort to replace a
faulty computer the size of a TV set that delayed Thursday's
shuttle launch by at least four days.
   The delay came after a judge cleared the way for liftoff by
rejecting environmentalists' fears that the shuttle's
nuclear-powered Gallileo space probe could scatter plutonium over
Florida in the event of a Challenger-like accident.
   NASA said the liftoff of Atlantis and its Jupiter-bound Galileo
could be rescheduled as early as Monday. The space agency NASA
wants to launch Atlantis as soon as possible because Jupiter will
be in the proper position only until Nov. 21; any delay beyond that
would push the flight off until mid-1991.
   The space agency also has two other shuttle launches planned
this year, and a long delay could affect that schedule.
   The decision to hold up the mission came after the master
controller in one of three main engines gave a false pressure
signal on a fuel pump, said launch director Bob Sieck. Subsequent
tests did not duplicate the bad reading.
   ``We have to ascertain that we completely understand the problem
and that there is no chance it will reoccur in flight and put us in
jeopardy,'' said Bob Crippen, director of the NASA team that gives
final launch clearance.
   ``The worst condition is that we would shut down an engine and
have to abort the flight and we want to make sure there is no
probability of that.''
   Atlantis commander Donald Williams said he was disappointed by
the postponement but agreed with the decision because ``safety is
an overriding concern'' in spaceflight.
   Engineers today worked at disconnecting wires and tubing to
reach the computer.
   Crippen said removal began Tuesday night. It required opening up
the engine compartment to get at the computer, which is the size of
a 17-inch portable television and controls all engine functions
during liftoff.
   ``It's a crowded place to work,'' Crippen said. ``But we have
done it before and we have the procedures in place.''
   The countdown, which began Monday, was halted at the 19-hour
mark. It will be picked up at that point when the computer work is
done. The five astronauts flew back to Houston this morning to
await resumption of the countdown.
   Shuttle workers received the bad news not long after getting the
news from U.S. District Judge Oliver Gasch in Washington that they
could proceed with launch preparations.
   The anti-nuclear groups had sought to block the liftoff on
grounds that plutonium particles would spread over Florida if
Atlantis exploded. The plutonium is in two nuclear-powered
generators that provide electricity for the Galileo.
   ``The court concludes that NASA has complied with requirements
of the National Environmental Protection Act,'' Gasch said.
   Justice Department attorneys representing the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration argued that Galileo's $1.5
billion, six-year mission to Jupiter carried very low risks. They
said the nuclear generators were well shielded and similar to 38
generators that have flown on 22 previous space missions.
   Gasch's ruling came on a request for a temporary restraining
order, a ruling that can't be appealed. The plaintiffs said they
were going back to Gasch today to seek a temporary injunction,
whose refusal can be appealed.
   The anti-nuclear groups said that if they lost in court they
would attempt to halt the launch by trying to infiltrate the
Kennedy Space Center and put people on the launch pad.
   ``On our side we're sad because the court didn't rule in our
favor. But on the other side, we feel that we've succeeded in
bringing the issue to the public, that they are planning to put
nuclear power in space,'' said Bruce Gagnon, coordinator of the
Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice, one of the groups that
sued.
   When the launch is attempted, he said, ``We're going to go with
our plan to put people on the launch pad.''
   Reaching the heavily guarded launch pad would be tough, said
Gary Wistrand, deputy director of security.
   ``We've installed various types of tactical intrusion devices,''
he said. ``Hopefully, if they try this tactic, we'll be able to
detect and apprehend them before they are successful in getting to
the pad.''

   Thousands of people marched through the
capital Wednesday to support President Omar Bongo and denounce an
alleged plot to overthrow him.
   The marchers, mostly supporters of the country's only legal
party, the Gabonese Democratic Party, paraded three miles from the
President Bongo Stadium to the gates of the presidential palace.
   Speakers at a rally before the palace denounced the alleged
conspiracy as ``odious.'' Bongo, who has ruled the West African
country since 1967, did not address the crowd.
   Police last month arrested Doukaka Nziengui, head of the Gabon
Water Co., in connection with the alleged plot. Others arrested
included the commander of the presidential guard, Mathias
Boussoungou, and a National Gendarmerie colonel, Mabounda Moussavou.
   They are alleged to have contacted European mercenaries and
received financial support from abroad to overthrow Bongo, who
outlawed opposition parties in 1968.

   East Germany's Communist ideology chief was quoted
today as calling for a more democratic society, but the official
party newspaper said the country can solve its problems only by
strengthening socialism.
   The developments were the latest in a series of mixed signals
the hard-line government has been sending the rest of the world as
it grapples with a growing movement for social change.
   Kurt Hager, one of the most influential figures in the Communist
Party hierarchy, called for greater participation of the people in
solving the country's problems, more openness in society and reform
of the state-controlled press.
   Hager, a member of the policy-making party Politburo, made the
comments in an interview with the Soviet weekly Moscow News on
Saturday, as street protests erupted in several cities during the
visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   State-run Radio DDR read the comments in a broadcast today.
   ``Our task in the immediate future is to come up with a clear
concept for the development of necessary changes,'' Hager said.
``That will require, above all, the active involvement of the
population in solving important problems and a new policy of public
information.''
   Referring to the exodus of mostly young people from the country,
Hager said that ``all of the obstacles have to be cleared away that
have apparently prevented our youth from developing their full
potential.''
   Hager also also called for the government to react to the
``needs and mood'' of the people.
   The party daily Neues Deutschland today conceded the country has
problems, but at the same time said socialism must be strengthened
to solve them.
   The newspaper also renewed its accusations against West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, accusing him of ``unveiled interference in
(East Germany's internal affairs.'' Kohl has been extremely
critical of the East German government in recent days.
   ``If today we stand before new demands that require new
solutions, we'll manage that ourselves,'' the newspaper said.
   ``We can solve our own problems, not through Kohl's recipes, but
through socialist means ... through the further strengthening of
socialism. Every demand and recommendation that in reality aims at
weakening or even doing away with socialism cannot bear fruit among
us,'' the newspaper wrote.
   Local Communist Party officials in at least three East German
cities _ Dresden, Leipzig and Magdeburg _ have either started talks
with pro-democracy activists or talks are planned, according to
West German news media reports.
   But questions remain whether high-ranking leaders in East Berlin
are ready to move away from the strict adherence to Communism that
has helped sparked an exodus to West Germany of tens of thousands
of its skilled young citizens.
   Guenter Krusche, head of the church in East Berlin, told West
German radio today there are indications a number of East German
cities will soon legalize the main opposition group, New Forum,
according to West German radio.
   On Tuesday, West German news media reports said local Communist
officials had met with opposition leaders in Dresden and talks were
expected soon in Leipzig.
   Westdeutscher Rundfunk radio in Cologne said today that
Magdeburg party leaders ``have also said they are ready for a
dialogue.''
   However, Erich Honecker, the country's 77-year-old Communist
leader, has indicated he will crush dissent if it challenges
stability.
   Over the weekend, authorities used force to disperse
demonstrators, clubbing and arresting hundreds. Then officials in
Leipzig allowed a peaceful march by 70,000 people Monday night.
   Local Communist officials met Monday with opposition leaders in
Dresden and talks were said to be expected in Leipzig, the first
signs of official willingness to discuss change.
   Christof Ziemer, the superintendent of Dresden's Lutheran
church, said the two sides discussed electoral reform, ending
travel restrictions and the release of people arrested during
street demonstrations.
   The nationwide protests by tens of thousands of people were East
Germany's most serious since Soviet tanks helped put down a
workers' revolt in 1953.
   Pro-democracy activists said authorities freed at least 500 of
the roughly 1,000 people arrested during demonstrations in Dresden
over the past week.
   Widespread discontent is responsible for the exodus of tens of
thousands of East Germans to the West and sparked the weekend
demonstrations, which coincided with official celebrations of the
country's 40th anniversary.
   Hans-Juergen Sievers, a Lutheran church pastor in Leipzig, said
Tuesday in a West German radio interview that he believed the
decision by the Leipzig officials to work for dialogue ``was
certainly not made alone without discussions with others.''
   East Germans do not choose their leaders and they need
government permission to travel abroad. Many complain of tyrannical
Communist officials who can make life miserable for people who
challenge the system.

<HEAD>Gov't Announces $390 Million Jobs Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday unveiled a $390
million plan to provide 1 million jobs a year for the poor in
India's urban centers.
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi announced the plan in Parliament,
saying it would create new jobs, finance entrepreneurs and build
new housing.
   According to government figures, about 10 million people are
unemployed and 34 percent of its 880 million people live below the
poverty line, defined as being able to afford a daily diet of 2,000
calories.
   The job program, named for former Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru, will cost $390 million annually and be implemented
immediately, Gandhi said.
   Several development programs this year have been named for Nehru
because Nov. 14 is the centennial of his birth. Nehru was
independent India's first prime minister and Gandhi's grandfather.
   When Gandhi announced the plan in the upper house, opposition
members booed and shouted, ``Corrupt Rajiv Gandhi, resign!
Resign!'' The opposition demands Gandhi's resignation following
newspaper allegations of corruption in a $1.4 billion artillery
deal with a Swedish company.

   Oct. 6
   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the coup attempt in Panama:
   The failure of the (coup attempt in Panama is) a blow to every
freedom-loving person in the world as Panamanians continue to live
in fear.
   It didn't have to work the way it did. The United States
government was there and ready to aid the rebels. It knew about the
planned coup two days in advance. ... So for the Pentagon and
security agencies to watch ... invites investigation. ...
   Those who would have the United States troops swoop into Panama
City ... would do well to remember the rise of the successful
popular movement to remove Ferdinand Marcos from power in the
Philippines in 1985 and 1986.
   Such a movement has yet to take place in Panama. ...
   If a popular movement to oust (Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noreiga
fails and brings violence on the heads of the Panamanians, then the
lives of American military personnel should be risked, but not
before.

   The State, Columbia, S.C., on Gorbachev's ban of labor strikes:
   Alarmed that a series of labor walkouts _ some for economic,
some for ethnic and some for political reasons _ were damaging the
economy and undercutting perestroika, (Mikhail) Gorbachev asked the
Soviet legislature to ban strikes altogether for 15 months.
   The Supreme Soviet broke out in debate. One deputy even had the
gall to call a ban unconstitutional. In the old days, when the
leader spoke, real debate did not follow _ not if those who would
dissent cherished their place in the scheme of things.
   This time the deputies got together and proposed a compromise
that was less than ... Gorbachev wanted but which he could accept.
   Under the compromise, strikes will be forbidden selectively in
certain key economic areas, and government agencies were given
permission to take over the railroads in the restive republics of
Azerbaijan and Armenia to keep traffic moving.
   While this hardly constituted a crushing legislative defeat for
Comrade No. 1, it suggested that the concept of separation of
powers is no longer a totally foreign one in the Soviet Union.
Furthermore, in the pre-Gorbachev days, Soviet leaders didn't
bother to seek legislative approval to stop strikes. The normal
procedure was to repress them ruthlessly.

   Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times on Jim Bakker's conviction:
   The conviction of televangelist Jim Bakker on 24 counts of fraud
and conspiracy was certainly a blow to him personally, and to those
who retain faith in the defrocked minister. And the conviction,
plus the revelations which went into it, have delivered a blow to
television high-voltage ministries in general. ...
   But none of this should reflect upon religion itself. That would
be the most tragic outcome of all. What Bakker was convicted of had
to do not with religion, but with the perversion of religion for
personal gain.
   If anything, the affair could be a positive factor for
traditional churches. It issues a warning to the unwary against
being taken in by a charismatic video preacher, encouraging the
support of local churches instead. If any good comes of the Bakker
trial, that could be it.

   Centre Daily Times, State College, Pa., on airline deregulation:
   Democratic lawmakers have long been concerned about declining
airline competition, ... but their concerns were largely ignored by
the Reagan administration.
   There are encouraging signs, however, that President Bush and a
growing number of Republican lawmakers are finally noticing the
evidence, particularly of monopoly control at major hub airports,
and may support steps to increase competition.
   Airline deregulation was expected to encourage new airlines and
more competition by getting rid of government red tape. Since the
changes took effect in 1978, many new airlines were launched but
most went out of businesss. At the same time, the Reagan
administration failed to increase airport capacity and, more
important, approved a string of large airline mergers. The results
have been higher fares and fewer options for consumers.
   Department figures underscore the need for changes to break up
... near monopolies. In 1988, eight airlines accounted for 90
percent of domestic air traffic, compared with 15 carriers in 1984
and 11 in 1979.
   Republicans ... are weighing legislation that could force
airlines to sell their computerized reservation systems, cap the
percentage of gates an airline may control at an airport, and ban
or restrict carriers' long-term leases at airports.
   In the long run, of course, increasing airport gates and
expanding facilities (are) the best way to stimulate competition.
But since that's not likely to happen immediately or on a large
enough scale, the growing interest in Congress and the
administration in taking other steps is welcome.

   Linda Ellerbee withdrew as a speaker for
the annual meeting of the Women's Chamber of Commerce of Texas,
citing the Austin chapter's decision to drop the leader of the
Texas pro-choice movement from a list of women to be honored.
   Phyllis Dunham, executive director of the Texas Abortion Rights
Action League, had been invited to the Austin chapter's awards
luncheon. But the invitation was withdrawn after some chamber
leaders determined the honor was tantamount to taking a stand on
the abortion issue, said Sondra Apelt, president of the Austin
chamber.
   ``Their attitude was they didn't want to get involved, but by
uninviting Phyllis Dunham they did get involved,'' Ellerbee said.
   ``I would not want my coming there (to the state conference) to
be mistaken as an endorsement of an anti-choice stand in any way,''
she said.
   She said she supports the Women's Chamber of Commerce and
regretted declining the invitation to speak Nov. 11 at the annual

   Actor Robert Wagner played reporter this
week to interview Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower.
   The two discussed farming, pesticides and the state of the soil
during an interview Wagner was conducting for the Fox Broadcasting
TV show ``The Reporters.''
   Wagner is one of several non-journalists working on an episode
about the environment.
   Producers of the show said the premise of Wagner's segment is
that through pesticides, farming is a major polluter of the
environment. Hightower, who is seeking re-election next year, has
advocated organic agriculture.
   ``I was interested in the opportunity to meet Hightower,''
Wagner said. ``I have a ranch, and I love the land. Every day the
environment becomes a bigger problem. How did it get to this point?
What can we do to make people aware of it? The results are
critical.''
   The Monday interview was filmed at Pioneer Farm northeast of
Austin. The show's producers also filmed at Whole Foods Market and
Gardenville, an organic gardening shop.

   The International Press Institute on Wednesday
protested the treatment of Western journalists during last
weekend's ceremonies marking the 40th anniversary of the founding
of East Germany.
   In a message to East German leader Erich Honecker, the
institute's director Peter Galliner singled out the ``unprovoked
attack'' by East German police on Clare Arron, a photographer with
the London-based Daily Telegraph, and condemned East Germany for
expelling Western journalists.
   ``The International Press Institute ... deplores the enforced
departure from East Germany of virtually all the Western press,
which we view as a serious violation of their right to `seek,
receive and impart information and ideas through the media
regardless of frontiers' as guaranteed by Article 19 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights,'' the message said.
   Besides Ms. Arron, four other Western journalists were harassed
while covering pro-democracy demonstrations which coincided with
the anniversary celebration visit of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   A Sunday Times correspondent, Peter Millar, was arrested and
taken to a police station where he was questioned and released
after six hours. Millar said he was handled roughly until the
police found out he was a foreign correspondent.
   Two U.S. journalists hid in an East German home for three hours
after being charged by police as they followed marchers. A third
journalist with the London-based Sunday Correspondent got away.
   All Western journalists were told to leave East Germany by
midnight Sunday.
   The International Press Institute, with offices in London and
Zurich, acts as a watchdog of media freedom and claims 2,000
journalists, editors and publishers in more than 60 countries among
its members.

   A farmer harvesting corn found the engine part
believed to hold the key to a United Airlines jet crash that killed
112 people in July.
   ``It will fill in the answers, as far as what precipitated the
engine failure,'' said Jerry Clark, an investigator for General
Electric Co., maker of the engine that disintegrated and severed
the jumbo jet's hydraulic controls.
   Janice Sorenson said she was driving a combine Tuesday when she
struck what turned out to be most of the engine rotor fan disk, a
part so highly prized that GE had offered a $50,000 reward for it.
   Workers today loaded the metal onto an airplane bound for a GE
plant in Cincinnati for inspection.
   Clark said GE will comb the fields over the weekend for the rest
of the disk and its connecting hardware. Only four of 20 bolts that
held it to the engine have been found, he said.
   But Clark he said he was confident the large piece _ which
represents about two-thirds of the 300-pound titanium disk _ would
allow investigators to pinpoint the cause of the engine failure.
   ``I felt a resistance against the combine, so I backed up, and I
looked and I could see the fan blades protruding from the ground,''
Mrs. Sorenson said today.
   Mrs. Sorenson said she knew immediately what the piece was
because GE had distributed pictures of it to farmers.
   ``I was shocked and I was very happy for GE because they put a
lot of time in it,'' she said. ``Hopefully it will solve some of
the problems they've been looking for.''
   United Flight 232 crashed July 19 about 50 miles away at Sioux
City. A total of 184 people survived.
   Investigators have speculated that a separated fan disk caused
the rear engine to disintegrate, throwing shrapnel that severed the
hydraulics and made the plane virtually impossible to control. The
crew managed to turn the jet around and reach Sioux City.
   ``There is no doubt about it, this is an extremely important
find,'' National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz in Washington said. ``Through meticulous metallurgy,
we hope to determine if that was the point of failure in the fan
section.''
   Clark urged others to keep searching for other engine parts. ``A
lot of important parts are still missing and are out there
somewhere,'' he said. ``We're still looking for the other side of
the separated piece.''
   Of the $271,000 in reward money offered, more than half is still
available, Clark said.
   In another development Tuesday, the NTSB released a radar map
showing what it says is the exact point where the engine of the
DC-10 failed during its flight over Iowa farmland.
   The flight path spirals tightly downward after a wide loop. Over
one point on the map, small triangles indicate where the tail
engine disintegrated, said Lopatkiewicz. He said investigators
believe the marks indicate falling parts.
   Clark said the disk originally was 31 inches in diameter. It was
found about 10 miles north of here. Metal detection experts will be
flown in this weekend to continue the search, he said.
   Several engine parts were found in farmers' fields on the day of
the crash. Last week, as farmers harvested crops, several found
pieces of the plane, including an engine fan blade in a bean field
five miles from here.
   Clark said Mrs. Sorenson might receive more than $50,000 because
some of the blades, for which the company is paying separate
rewards, were still attached, said GE lawyer Stephen Gadd.
   Mrs. Sorenson said this morning she hadn't had time to think
about the reward. ``I guess that's kind of a minor part right now.''

   The Navy's investigation of the USS Iowa
explosion was ``thorough, complete and expeditious'' and did not
malign the character of two sailors who were focuses of the
inquiry, the Pentagon's inspector general said in a report obtained
today.
   ``All logical investigative leads were covered, including those
that required examining the backgrounds of persons closest to the
explosion,'' Inspector General June Gibbs Brown said in a report to
Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett III.
   Ms. Brown said she has concluded that the (Naval Investigative
Service) investigation was ``thorough, complete and expeditious.''
   She also said the NIS ``did not malign the character'' of two
sailors who had been in the gun turret that exploded by looking
into rumors of homosexuality and a possible criminal connection to
the blast.
   The inspector general's report, dated Oct. 6, was undertaken in
the wake of allegations that the NIS had mishandled the probe. It
was made available to The Associated Press by Navy officials.
   Rear Adm. Richard Milligan, who conducted the Navy's four-month
study of the explosion, said Gunners Mate Clayton Hartwig was the
most likely person to have caused the explosion, and that he
apparently placed some type of detonator between gun powder bags.
   Hartwig and 46 other sailors were killed in the April 19
explosion, which occurred in the No. 2 gun turret of the battleship
as it conducted gunnery practice off Puerto Rico.
   Hartwig's family has accused the Navy of using the sailor as a
scapegoat and sought a congressional investigation into the Navy's
report. Another sailor, Gunner's Mate Kendall Truitt, has charged
the Navy with slurring his reputation.
   Ms. Brown noted that Milligan brought the NIS into the
investigation 21 days after the blast occurred, when allegations of
possible criminal acts surfaced.
   She said Truitt was investigated because of ``a possible motive
for homicide'' that surfaced after Hartwig's sister wrote a letter
to the Iowa's commander complaining that her late brother had made
Truitt the sole beneficiary of a life insurance policy.
   ``Several witnesses, including members of Hartwig's family,
raised the possibility of homosexuality on the part of Hartwig ...
The NIS had no choice but to explore the issue as a potential
motive in the incident. To neglect that investigative lead would
have been derelict,'' Ms. Brown wrote.
   ``The NIS report offered no opinion about the homosexuality
issue,'' she said. While witness statements ``alluded to possible
homosexuality, the NIS investigation did not confirm it and the
report did not claim that either Hartwig or Truitt were-are
homosexual. The NIS did not malign the character of Hartwig or
Truitt.''
   ``Homicide, suicide and human error were all obvious theories
that had to be explored,'' Ms. Brown added. ``The homicide theory
was short-lived. Truitt was never a definitive homicide suspect
....''
   Inspectors general in each federal department monitor their
agency's performance and investigate allegations of wrongdoing.

   Americans avidly followed news of Hurricane
Hugo but paid scant attention to another widely reported story, the
personal troubles of Rep. Barney Frank, according to a survey
released Wednesday.
   In its News Interest Index for October, Times Mirror reported
that 60 percent of the public followed the Hugo story very closely,
placing it third on the list of the most closely followed stories
of the past three years.
   Only the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger and the
rescue of Jessica McClure from a well in Texas have attracted
greater public attention since the Times Mirror surveys began in
1986.
   Eighty percent of those polled said they followed news of the
Challenger explosion, in January 1986, very closely. The story of
the child rescue in October 1987 was followed very closely by 69
percent.
   By contrast with the attention paid to the hurricane coverage,
only 6 percent said they closely followed stories about Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat who has acknowledged patronizing a male
prostitute and then hiring him as a personal assistant and driver.
   This puts the Frank story in a tie for the least closely
followed story of those surveyed. The troubles of former Japanese
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, who resigned in May because of an
influence-peddling scandal, were also attended to closely by only 6
percent of Americans polled.
   ``The difference in public response to these two stories is in
keeping with a pattern that has become clear from the monthly
findings of the Times Mirror News Interest Index,'' Times Mirror
said in a news release. ``Public attentiveness to coverage of news
events is high, while public attentiveness to news about most
personal scandals is usually low.''
   Times Mirror also said that its October findings ``dramatically
reinforced'' previous indications that news from Washington, even
when it has far-reaching consequences, often gets little attention.
   No major Washington story in the latest survey was followed
closely by as many as 25 percent of Americans.
   Even interest in overseas events, such as the flight of East
German refugees to West Germany at 31 percent and the failed coup
attempt in Panama at 29 percent, outdrew Washington stories.
   Only 19 percent paid close attention to attempts in Congress to
repeal the new catastrophic illness insurance plan, although
understandably this rose to 36 percent among persons over age 50.
   President Bush's education summit with governors was followed by
15 percent and House approval of a cut in the capital gains tax by
14 percent.
   Only 12 percent of the sample in the survey could identify Frank
without assistance and only 10 percent could identify Samuel
Pierce, former secretary of the scandal-plagued Department of
Housing and Urban Development.
   By contrast, 80 percent knew that actress Zsa Zsa Gabor had been
in the news because of her trial in Beverly Hills, Calif., on
charges of slapping a policeman.
   Times Mirror said the survey results were based on telephone
interviews with 1,234 adults 18 or older, conducted from Oct. 5-8.
It said the possible error attributable to sampling and other
random effects was plus or minus 3 percent.
   The study was conducted by the Times Mirror Center for the
People &amp; the Press, a division of The Times Mirror Company, which
publishes the Los Angeles Times, Newsday, the Baltimore Sun, the

<HEAD>Beijing University Freshmen to be Taught to Shoot</HEAD>

   Beijing University freshmen will be taught how to
shoot and throw hand grenades during special year-long military
training program that begins Thursday, an official newspaper said.
   Camp and field training, marching in formation, and basic
military knowledge also are on the curriculum, the Guangming Daily
said Wednesday. It did not give details of the weapons training or
say whether the students would use live ammunition.
   Xinhua News Agency reported 143 other colleges and universities
would conduct special eight-week military and political training
courses, variously sending all or some of the students to military
camps or inviting officers to campus.
   Beijing University, whose students helped lead the crushed
pro-democracy movement in the spring, announced that its freshmen
class would spend a full year in military training at the army
academy in Shijiazhuang, 190 miles south of Beijing.
   University President Wu Shuqing said Saturday it was an
experiment that had been planned well before the pro-democracy
protests. He said experience had shown that military training was
beneficial to students.
   Most colleges already require one month of military training for
freshmen, but it is usually restricted to parade-ground drills and
basic military theory.
   Xinhua quoted an unidentified official of the State Education
Commission as saying the commission drew up a plan in 1987 to send
students at 10 key univerities, including Beijing University, for a
``relatively long period of military training.''
   ``The plan failed because it was beyond the capacity of the
army,'' he said. But it was going ahead for Beijing University, he
said, because ``the graduates of the prestigious Beijing University
should be fit for socialist construction (and) have a clear
political orientation and sound morality.''
   He said the program was not punishment for the students' role in
the protests. He said military training was popular among students,
parents and teachers ``because after the training the students
become better disciplined, and come to have a better understanding
of the practical conditions of the country.''
   Many more colleges wish to send students for such training, he
said.
   The Guangming Daily said the Beijing University class would
divide its time evenly among military, political and humanities
classes. It said the school planned an opening ceremony for the
students Thursday, and had been preparing for their arrival by
shipping in textbooks and freshly painting the dormitories,
cafeterias and desks.
   The students will wear the same uniform as the academy's 3,400
military cadets, Xinhua said. It described the school as China's
best training ground for junior officers, with ``up-to-date
teaching facilities.''
   Beijing University's freshman class numbers fewer than 800 this
year, down from the 2,100 that had been planned before the protests
and the June army crackdown. The State Education Commission, which
decides enrollment, also has cut the freshman classes of other
universities nationwide, apparently in an effort to better maintain
control over the student body.
   Wu said Beijing University's student population had grown too
large for its facilities, but said next year's freshman class
probably would be closer to the size of previous years.

   Tickets that normally cost $24 went for
as little as 1 cent, but Trinity Repertory Theater's experiment
with letting patrons pay what they wanted was a success, a
spokeswoman said Wednesday.
   ``We got about 240 people, which is a lot more than we
expected'' on Tuesday for a preview performance in the 550-seat
theater, Suzanne Fortier said.
   The audience for the performance of Maxim Gorky's ``Summerfolk''
ranged ``from students to elderly from the apartment up the
street,'' she said.
   Based on similar experiments in Baltimore and San Diego,
Trinity's managing director, E. Timothy Langan, said he expected
people would pay $3 to $4.
   Fortier said most people paid $5 to $10. ``We got everything
from a penny a ticket to $20 a ticket,'' she said. The only rule
was that no one got in free.
   The theater had yet to compile figures on revenue for the
evening.
   Langan said the theater had set aside $5,000 from a grant to
cover the costs of the experiment.
   Fortier said the experiment likely would be repeated.

   Actress Peggy Lipton, one of the stars of
television's ``The Mod Squad,'' has filed for divorce from music
producer Quincy Jones after 15 years of marriage, according to
court papers.
   Miss Lipton, whose real name is Margaret Ann Lipton Jones, cited
irreconcilable differences for the breakup and is seeking
unspecified spousal and child support, according to court papers
filed Tuesday.
   She also seeks joint custody of the couple's two daughters,
Kidada, 15, and Rashida, 13, who have been living with their mother
since their parents separated three years ago, the court papers say.
   The couple married Sept. 14, 1974.
   Miss Lipton played Julie Barnes in ``The Mod Squad,'' a series
about undercover, counterculture cops that aired from 1968 to 1973.
Jones has produced a number of hit albums, including Michael
Jackson's ``Thriller.''

   Anglers antsy to hit the lake
whenever the mood strikes need not worry about buzzing up Gerlane
Berkheimer's bait shop any time of the day or night.
   Mrs. Berkheimer and her family have run an around-the-clock bait
business for a decade in this community 12 miles from Raystown Lake.
   The demand at odd hours for minnows, worms and fishing supplies
was reinforced about seven years ago when Mrs. Berkheimer's
husband, Daryl, was hospitalized one night, leaving the business
unattended.
   A fisherman got the shop's door off the hinges, took some bait,
left $11 and a note and put the door back, said Mrs. Berkheimer.

   A newfangled push-button device for
guarding against germs on toilet seats has Alan Brill flushed with
excitement.
   Brill, a former advertising agent, is distributing the
Swiss-made devices that include a special toilet seat attached to a
spool of plastic wrap, which rolls out in place of conventional
paper seat covers.
   ``People are paranoid about what you can contract from a toilet
seat,'' said Brill, whose company has installed hundreds of the
devices in Florida and Georgia. ``If you have a toilet seat covered
with paper, the paper could absorb moisture that could go right to
your skin.''
   Brill's customers include hotels, country clubs and restaurants.
   The device sells for $250 to $280 and can be leased for $15 to
$19 a month. A case of 12 rolls of replacement plastic costs
$48.95, with each spool providing 90 sittings worth.
   Brill said he picked up an interest in bathroom hygiene from his
father, who considered toilet seats unsanitary. Brill first saw the
Hygolet seat demonstrated in 1985.
   ``I thought it was the greatest thing since electricity,'' he
said. ``You could freely sit on a toilet seat without worrying
about who sat on it before you.''

<HEAD>Blacks Criticize Group for Honoring Police Commissioner During 60s
Strife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two black officials criticized an
association for honoring the late L.B. Sullivan, the city's police
commissioner during the civil rights turmoil in the 60s and a
participant in a historic libel lawsuit.
   ``L.B. Sullivan was a famous racist and hater of black people
and anything they stood for,'' said Montgomery County Commissioner
Frank Bray after the Alabama Peace Officers Association announced
that Sullivan would be installed Wednesday in its Hall of Fame.
   ``I think it was very inappropriate,'' said state Rep. Alvin
Holmes. ``He promoted segregation and racism in the city.''
   However, a third black official, Montgomery City Councilman
Joseph Dickerson, said he has no harsh feelings about the induction
of Sullivan, who was Montgomery's police commissioner from
1959-1967.
   ``The police commissioner's actions during the 1960s were a sign
of the times,'' he said. ``He was playing a role. If he was the
police commissioner today, he would be playing a completely
different role.''
   Murfee Gewin, executive director of the Peace Officers
Association, said the induction was based on Sullivan's overall
contribution to law enforcement.
   ``He was prominent in the field of advanced training of law
enforcement officers and in increasing their abilities through
continuing education,'' Gewin said. ``This is a career award.''
   Sullivan sued The New York Times in 1960 after it ran an
advertisement soliciting funds for the legal defense of the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. The ad said Montgomery police, armed with
guns and tear gas, surrounded a black college after a student
demonstration.
   Sullivan won the libel suit and a $500,000 judgment when the
case was tried in Montgomery, Alabama's capital. But the U.S.
Supreme Court eventually overturned the verdict on appeal,
establishing libel precedent in the process.
   The court, ruling in what became known in libel case history as
Sullivan vs. The New York Times, asserted that public officials who
sue for libel must show that the story, even if false, was
published with malice, with knowledge the story was false or with
``reckless disregard'' for whether it was true or false. The
court's decision also established a higher standard of evidence to
prove malice.
   Sullivan, who was state public safety director from 1951-1955,
also served as state prison commissioner in the early 1970s when
Alabama's overcrowded prisons came under federal court scrutiny. He
was on then-Attorney General Bill Baxley's staff as executive
assistant when he died in 1977 at age 56.

   Trygve Haavelmo, a Norwegian professor
who dislikes awards for academics, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Science on Wednesday for using statistics and probability
to forecast how economies behave.
   Haavelmo ``had a swift and pathbreaking influence'' on the new
science of econometrics with his probability theory, the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the award.
   ``I am honored. Anyone would be. But I had nothing to do with
making this award. I really have nothing to say,'' said Haavelmo,
77, in an interview.
   The prize ``is quite irrelevant to the real issues. I'm
exhausted and I have nothing more to say,'' he added.
   Haavelmo, who still works part time at the University of Oslo,
has privately voiced disdain for academic prizes, colleagues said.
Tore Thornstad, a co-worker at the university, described Haavelmo
as a shy, reserved person who prefers research and teaching to
being in the limelight.
   In his 1941 doctoral dissertation for Harvard University,
Haavelmo pioneered the field of econometrics, which introduced
statistical probability to economic testing and forecasting.
   The thesis was published in 1944. Ten years later he published a
book of his research on economic development theory.
   The Academy of Sciences said in its citation that Haavelmo was
awarded the $469,000 prize ``for his clarification of the
probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of
simultaneous economic structures.''
   Assar Lindbeck, head of the academy's prize committee and a
personal friend of Haavelmo, called him ``the father of modern
econometrics'' and a dominant figure in post-war economic theories.
   ``As soon as you take a serious report in your hand or a
long-term projection, it is econometrics that charts the
relationship between all quantitative economic analyses,'' Lindbeck
told reporters.
   Haavelmo was the second Norwegian to win the economics prize
since it was introduced in 1969 by the Bank of Sweden and added to
the five other Nobel prizes. Ragnar Frisch, who once employed
Haavelmo as a a research assistant, won the prize in its inaugural
year.
   Haavelmo is a member of the American Economic Association and
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
   He was born Dec. 13, 1911 in the town of Skedsmo a few miles
east of Oslo, the son of a school administrator. He graduated from
the University of Oslo in 1933.
   He moved to the United States in 1939, at the outbreak of World
War II, on a Rockefeller grant and worked at the University of
Chicago and later in New York with the Norwegian Trade Ministry.
   Haavelmo's doctoral thesis won him immediate recognition. A
think tank of young economic scientists from several nationalities,
the Cowles Commission, was created to pursue the ideas he raised
and other theories.
   Haavelmo returned to Norway in 1947 and became professor of
economics at the University of Oslo.
   ``I see Haavelmo as an original thinker but one who always kept
his theories relevant to the real world,'' said Thorvald Moe, a
senior official of the Norwegian Finance Ministry.
   According to his sister-in-law, Mrs. Margit Haavelmo, he never
married and his only brother died five years ago. ``He is a very
well liked man,'' Mrs. Haavelmo said in a telephone interview.
   Roedseth, director of Oslo University's Social Economics
Institute, said Haavelmo usually comes in to work several times a
week, although he went on full pension 10 years ago.

   Would you give a credit card to a teen-ager? Linda
Fingersh would.
   ``We felt that it would be to his advantage to learn about
credit now in a small, controlled environment,'' said Mrs.
Fingersh, who helped her 13-year-old son, Adam, get a credit card
from the Young Americans Bank. ``He's very, very responsible and
that's why we co-signed.''
   More than 300 teen-agers have applied for credit cards since
they were offered Aug. 3, said Leanne Cadman, a loan officer at the
bank. Ten have been approved so far, but the bank noted that many
applications are still being processed.
   The bank's premise is simple: Credit is a fact of life, and
every youngster needs to learn how to use it responsibly. ``What
we're trying to do is to teach them ... make sure what you're
buying is worth it,'' Cadman said.
   The card has a $100 limit, and is available to people who are at
least 12 years old who have had a savings account with a minimum
$10 balance for at least six months. Applicants must have an adult
co-signer. The annual fee is $15, and the card carries an 18.8
percent annual percentage rate.
   Deb Breeling, a spokeswoman at the bank, said other banks offer
credit cards in children's names on their parents' accounts but,
``as far as just having it in the child's name, I think ours is the
only one.''
   Adam Fingersh said the card will help teen-agers learn the
proper use of credit.
   ``At some point, we're going to have to learn about credit. It's
better to learn with a $100 dollar limit,'' said Adam, who plans to
use his card mainly in his T-shirt business, Adam's Designs.
   Consumer-oriented groups, such as the National Center for
Financial Education, have criticized the bank's program, claiming
it teaches ``buy now and pay later.''
   ``Credit card abuse and the overspending that credit cards are
leading to is a very serious problem in our society,'' said Loren
Dunton, executive director of the San Diego-based center. The
non-profit organization has launched a drive to discourage credit
cards for teen-agers.
   ``Our campaign is to discourage other banks from following suit
around the country,'' he said. ``You can teach firearms without
giving kids a loaded gun. You can teach credit card responsibility
without giving young teens a credit card.''
   Jeanne Goody, director of education for the non-profit Consumer
Credit Counseling Service in Denver, said, ``I can see no reason in
the world why a 12-year-old should have a credit card. ... I think
it was a really bad idea.''
   Mrs. Fingersh said her son has friends whose parents have gotten
into financial trouble with credit cards. She has seen teen-agers
out on their own at 18 ``go like crazy'' when they obtain their
first credit card.
   She does not want that to happen to Adam.
   Two other banks that cater to children have no plans to add a
credit card to their services.
   ``That's a nightmare that I don't want to get into,'' said
Sherrie Avery, liaison between First National Bank of South Miami
and its Twiglet Bank at David Fairchild Elementary School.
   Twiglet, which opened in November 1987, is a commercial bank
operated by students. It offers checking and savings accounts, and
has about $14,000 in deposits and more than 400 accounts. Customers
must be students at the school.
   The First Children's Bank inside the F.A.O. Schwarz Toy Store,
is a division of the First New York Bank for Business. It offers
checking and savings accounts and a college certificate of deposit
plan, but has no plans to add a credit card, said Mary
Quinn-Cordero, a bank spokeswoman.
   Insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the 2-year-old
Young Americans Bank has more than 9,350 depositors with $5.9
million in deposits. It offers checking and savings accounts and
loans, and sponsors seminars on financial issues from balancing
checking accounts to planning for college.
   Customers, who range from newborn to 22 years, live in 37 states
and six foreign countries.
   ``What has impressed me most is the manner in which these kids
handle their accounts,'' said Linda Sanders, bank president. ``Day
in and day out, they have earned the respect that we've given
them.''

   The House voted today to liberalize the
restrictions it had placed on federally subsidized abortions for
the poor since 1981.
   Lawmakers accepted a more permissive Senate provision by voice
vote, thus setting up a confrontation with President Bush, who has
promised to veto legislation relaxing the conditions for
Medicaid-financed abortions.
   The Senate provision would have Medicaid pay for abortions when
the mother's life is in jeopardy or when the pregnancy resulted
from rape or incest.
   The House, on a 216-206 vote, first rejected its own
restrictions that allow a Medicaid-financed abortion only when a
woman's life is threatened by her pregnancy.
   The liberalized abortion language also prevailed on a second
tally, by a vote of 212-207.
   The abortion provision was part of a $156.7 billion measure to
finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which
began Oct. 1.
   In August, Bush threatened to veto the entire spending bill if
it contains the more liberal abortion language. Administration
officials reiterated that threat this week.

<TEXT>
   On the fringes of this week's annual
convention of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative
Party, the race to succeed her has begun.
   In a party she has dominated for 14 years, and which prides
itself on loyalty to the leader in good times and bad, the language
is coded and the jockeying discreet.
   After 10 years as prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher remains firmly
in control of her party and intent on several more years in office.
She is greeted with undimmed enthusiasm as she arrives daily in the
convention center to sit attentively through hours of debates and
speeches by her Cabinet ministers.
   By tradition, a prolonged standing ovation is guaranteed when
she winds up the convention on Friday, her 64th birthday, with her
keynote address.
   But Mrs. Thatcher's public opinion poll ratings are at an
eight-year low, the pound is sliding, interest rates are soaring
and headlines warn of economic crisis.
   Thus speculation about the succession is inevitable, and outside
the Winter Gardens conference hall in this north England seaside
resort, two of the top hopefuls, ex-Defense Secretary Michael
Heseltine and Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe, are playing
to packed houses.
   Howe said Wednesday that Conservatives ``must show that we are
good, not just at winning battles, but at winning arguments and
winning friends.
   ``We must choose the style to match the mood of Britain ...
making sure that people recognize us as a listening party, just as
much as a crusading one,'' Howe added at a crowded fringe meeting.
   Decoded, Howe's statement was a clear criticism of Mrs.
Thatcher's combative style, and the image she projects of lacking
compassion toward the have-nots in the entrepreneurial Britain she
has tried to create.
   Howe, 62, whose mild-mannered style is the antithesis of Mrs.
Thatcher's, was removed as foreign secretary last summer in what
was widely seen as a demotion.
   Heseltine, 56, a temperamental politician who stalked out of the
Thatcher Cabinet in 1986 during a dispute over the takeover of an
ailing helicopter-maker, Westland, topped two public opinion polls
last week as the favorite to succeed Mrs. Thatcher.
   Howe was also among the top six potential successors, along with
former party chief Norman Tebbit, Transport Secretary Cecil
Parkinson, and ex-Education Secretary Kenneth Baker, now party
chairman.
   At a standing-room only fringe meeting in a Victorian theater,
Heseltine hinted that the Thatcher government _ presiding over a
record trade deficit _ was letting Britain slip back into the old
ills of high-wage, low-productivity industry.
   ``Truth does not change simply because it is 10 years old,''
thundered the tall, self-made millionaire. ``Britain is not paying
its way.''
   Heseltine, a rank-and-file lawmaker, has been doing what all
ambitious politicians do while waiting in the wings: going for the
grass roots by campaigning tirelessly up and down the country.
   He never criticizes Mrs. Thatcher herself, and when asked about
his leadership aspirations, his stock response is that he'll do
whatever the party asks.
   The leader of the Conservative Party is chosen by its members of
Parliament, and if the party has a parliamentary majority, the
leader automatically becomes prime minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher has won three successive elections, and it is
generally assumed she will lead the party into the next election,
which must be held by mid-1992.
   But the Tories are trailing the opposition Labor Party by an
average of seven points in a string of recent opinion polls. Labor
has been consistently ahead for the past four months.
   Now, to take the shine of the Tory convention, interest rates
are at 15 percent, double the rate of June 1988. Inflation, which
Mrs. Thatcher vowed to eradicate, is at 7.3 percent, and the pound
has suddenly weakened.
   The downturn could be just a phase, as Mrs. Thatcher's
supporters insist. But if it is worse than that, and she looks like
losing the next election, she might have to make way for a
candidate with better prospects.
   Commented London's liberal Guardian newspaper, ``If and when ...
there actually is a vote for the leadership of the Conservative
party to succeed Mrs. Thatcher, it may be judged that the race
began ... in Blackpool.''

   There are more than 20 million people of
Hispanic origin in the United States, a nine-year increase of 5{
million, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday.
   ``This is our first estimate of over 20 million,'' said Jorge
Del Pinal, chief of the Ethnic and Hispanic Statistics Branch at
the bureau. ``It's up from about 14.5 million in 1980.''
   Hispanics constitute 8.2 percent of the U.S. population and are
the fastest growing large population group. The bureau said
immigration was a major factor in the increase, accounting for
about half of the growth.
   About two-thirds of the Hispanics in the United States live in
just three states. California leads with 34 percent, followed by
Texas at 21 percent and New York with 10 percent.
   Florida has 8 percent of the nation's Hispanics, and there are
significant populations in Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona, New
Mexico and Colorado, the bureau reported.
   Estimates are not prepared for every state because ``Hispanics
are not well spread out throughout the United States,'' Del Pinal
said.
   The Census report estimated the total Hispanic population of the
United States at 20,076,000 as of March, up from 19,431,000 a year
earlier.
   The largest segment is Mexicans at 12,567,000, followed by
people of Central and South American origin, 2,545,000, Puerto
Ricans, 2,328,000, and Cubans, 1,068,000. The balance were of
Spanish or other Hispanic origin.
   Mexicans were mostly concentrated in Texas and California, the
report said. Cubans are mostly in Florida, while Puerto Ricans tend
to live in New York, and Central and South Americans are largely in
California and New York.
   While Mexicans were the largest group they are not the fastest
growing, the report said.
   Comparing the estimates for 1982 and 1989, the bureau said
Central and South Americans had increased by 67 percent. The
``other Hispanic'' category rose 31 percent, followed by Mexicans,

   A dispute over church pension funds invested
in companies operating in South Africa is dividing members of the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America as its pension board
prepares to meet this week.
   A resolution ordering the board to divest all South African
holdings by Sept. 1, 1991, was approved in August at the
denomination's first churchwide meeting since the 1987 merger of
the Lutheran Church in America, the American Lutheran Church and
the Association of Evangelical Lutheran Churches.
   At least one congregation, Advent Lutheran Church in the St.
Paul suburb of Roseville, has authorized a lawsuit to prevent the
pension board from divesting, says its pastor, Thomas Basich.
   ``Nobody is for apartheid; I think it's awful,'' said Basich.
``The issue here is whether or not political considerations should
enter into investment decisions without approval of the 26,000
people who are members of the pension fund and beneficiaries of the
pension fund.''
   The Rev. Joseph W. Ellwanger, of Cross Lutheran Church in
Milwaukee, counters: ``The bottom line must not be financial return
but what is morally right.''
   ``The other point is that investments in non-South African
companies have indeed yielded as much as, and, in many cases, more
than companies involved in South Africa,'' said Ellwanger, acting
treasurer of Pension Members for Justice, a grassroots Lutheran
organization advocating divestiture to pressure South Africa to end
its policy of racial segregation known as apartheid.
   At stake is the denomination's $1.6 billion pension fund, of
which $84.9 million is invested in companies that do business in
South Africa.
   Some members of the independently incorporated pension board
based in Minneapolis also oppose the resolution. Board President
John Kapanke has said the board, at its monthly meeting here
Thursday through Saturday, will consider seeking a court judgment
on whether the board can totally divest within the bounds of its
fiduciary responsibility.
   ``It is our opinion that the timeline as proposed puts the board
in an almost impossible situation if it is to divest within a
prudent policy,'' Kapanke said during the August convention.
   It is unclear how many of the 21-member pension board oppose
divestment, or whether they have the authority to defy the
assembly, Kapanke said.
   ``They are going to try to weigh the directive of the churchwide
assembly with the fiduciary responsibility of the members,'' he
said.
   If the board fails to meet the 1991 deadline, Kapanke said
church members could institute a procedure to remove members.
   Several Protestant denominations, notably the Episcopal Church,
the United Church of Christ, the Church of the Brethren and the
Quakers already have strong divestment policies at varying stages
of implementation, said Donna Katzin. She is director of South
Africa programs for the Interfaith Center on Corporate
Responsibility in New York, an ecumenical coalition of the Lutheran
body.
   However, the Lutheran pension board believes it's the first U.S.
religious denomination to set a specific date for divestment, she
said.
   Ellwanger said the pension board knew the resolution was
imminent because the new denomination's constituting convention in
1987 passed a similar resolution.
   ``I'm not sure that any deadline would be satisfactory to John
Kapanke and people against divestment,'' Ellwanger said.
   Basich said he doesn't believe divestiture is an ethical way to
end apartheid. ``I don't think it's right for people who live
10,000 miles away to wreck another country's economy. Who's going
to gain by that?''
   He said members already have the option of putting their pension
money in ``South Africa free'' funds but that only 13 percent of
pension fund contributions have been so earmarked.
   Kapanke said investments in non-South African companies have
performed well. ``Through August 31, the social purposes equity
fund (non-South African investments) was up about 28 percent,'' he
said.
   An estimated 85 percent of the convention's 1,041 delegates
voted for the divestment deadline, but Kapanke said delegates
didn't fully understand the issue and called for a vote on the
matter by pension plan members.

   The Legislature today killed 10 more
anti-abortion bills favored by Gov. Bob Martinez and sped toward
early adjournment without disturbing Florida's abortion law.
   ``A right, having been established, is not easily removed,''
said House Speaker Tom Gustafson, a Democrat.
   Four bills in the Republican governor's package were killed on
Tuesday, the first day of a special session he convened to take
advantage of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July opening the door
to more restrictive abortion laws.
   Today, the Senate Health Care Committee voted 5-2 to kill a
proposed constitutional amendment restricting abortions to cases of
rape or incest or when the mother's health is in danger or the
fetus deformed.
   Later, the panel defeated three proposals to tighten clinic
regulations, and a House subcommittee rejected six bills that
mirrored the Senate measures.
   ``I don't think it's a moment for rejoicing,'' Martinez said
after the first defeat of the day. ``If anything, it's a moment of
sadness.''
   The proceedings were the nation's first special session on
abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a restrictive Missouri
abortion law.
   Gustafson and Senate President Bob Crawford, also a Democrat,
said they expected both houses to adjourn by late afternoon. The
special session was to have lasted through Friday.
   ``I think the Legislature was reflecting the will of the
people,'' said Crawford.
   Only a handful of spectators attended today's proceedings, and
virtually none of the estimated 10,000 demonstraters in town Monday
and Tuesday were visible today at the Capitol.
   In recent weeks, the first-term governor has focused on the
issue of regulating clinics more closely. Three South Florida
clinics have been closed by the state in the last two weeks after
inspectors found unhealthy conditions.
   On Tuesday, about 1,000 abortion-rights activists celebrated
outside the Capitol.
   ``The real news story is that nothing is going to happen here,''
Kate Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, told a cheering crowd. ``Martinez is suffering a
very embarrassing defeat.''
   Florida lawmakers convened in the afternoon amid tight security
after more than 10,000 pro-choice and anti-abortion demonstrators
held rallies. Police guarded the doors to the Democratic-controlled
Senate and House chambers.
   The abortion-rights side sang ``America the Beautiful'' and
hired an airplane to trail a banner reading, ``Keep Abortion
Legal.'' Anti-abortionist activists wore T-shirts with the words:
``Spoken As a Former Fetus ... I'm Glad I'm Here.''
   Police made two arrests. A 14-year-old was charged with a
misdemeanor for wearing a derogatory message on his jacket that
referred to the governor, and a 49-year-old abortion-rights
supporter was jailed on charges of striking a man in the face with
a video camera.
   Martinez's proposals that were defeated by the Senate Health and
Rehabilitative Services Committee included a ban on use of public
financing and public hospitals for abortions and a requirement for
viability tests on the fetuses of women who are at least 20 weeks
pregnant.
   Those bills were defeated 9-3, as was a proposal that would have
required women to wait a week and undergo counseling before having
an abortion.
   The committee said a bill to establish a state adoption center
to promote adoption as an alternative to abortion was a good idea,
but defeated it 8-4. Lawmakers said it should be taken up again
when the Legislature considers child abuse reform next month.
   The committee action Tuesday ``was a blow to the unborn,'' said
Ken Conner, president of the Florida Right to Life.
   Elsewhere, a legislative committee Tuesday in Springfield, Ill.,
heard pro-choice advocates decry proposed curbs on late-term
abortions, but the panel chairman said the bill probably would go
to the House without major changes.
   In Harrisburg, Pa., a lawmaker introduced a bill to eliminate a
law requiring rape and incest victims to report the crimes before
they can get publicly funded abortions. A House committee set a
hearing on a series of abortion-related bills for Friday.

   A 2-year-old girl tumbled three stories through a

young life came through a serious accident without a scratch,
authorities said.
   Raecine Gomez remained hospitalized for observation Wednesday
``just to make sure,'' said nursing supervisor Julie Adams at
Denver General Hospital.
   Raecine's family said the girl fell through a foot-wide hole
left by a missing bar in the railing outside her family's apartment.
   Her parents, Tillie and Robert Gomez, said they asked the
complex's maintenance department to repair the balcony three months
ago, but they have received no response.
   Apartment managers could not be reached Wednesday for comment. A
secretary said the managers were out of the office.
   ``She's got a guardian angel watching over her,'' said Mrs.
Gomez.
   When Raecine was an infant, a tornado somersaulted the car she
and her mother were in, rolling it three times and plastering it
against a store. Raecine and her mother were unscathed.

   An official commentary Thursday condemned
reformist efforts to reduce the role of Communist Party ideologues
in government and factory management, saying this would turn the
party into a mere ``after-hours club.''
   The commentary in the Beijing Daily blamed ousted party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang for the notion that the party should stick to
running itself. It was one of the harshest attacks on the purged
leader in weeks.
   After several months of steady media condemnation, the latest
official comments on Zhao had taken a softer tone and credited him
with contributions to China's economic reform.
   The hard-line commentary not only signaled that differences
still exist in the leadership over how to treat Zhao, but put in
doubt the future of political reforms.
   In the past year, the leadership has slowly stalled or reversed
on key elements of its economic reform program, which sought to
reduce rigid central planning.
   Political reforms were never given as much priority and were
much less ambitious, but a basic goal was the separation of party
and government functions to allow government to become more
professional with a stronger legal base.
   Both political and economic reformists had advocated reducing
the party's role in enterprises. Every enterprise has a party
branch.
   The ``manager responsibility system,'' which allowed factory
managers to make business decisions on their own as long as they
could earn profits, was adopted widely over the past decade and
praised for boosting production.
   But the Beijing Daily, which has carried many of the media's
most hard-line articles since the June crackdown on pro-democracy
protests, condemned any efforts to divorce the party from the
day-to-day running of the government and factories.
   ``Reform of political structures and separating the government
and party doesn't mean the two are getting divorced,'' it said.
``It is intended to solidify the party's position in power and
improve and strengthen its leadership.''
   It accused Zhao of weakening the party's base in factories, its
``major source of strength,'' by emphasizing the role of the
factory director.
   ``He put the enterprises' party organizations in an auxiliary,
subordinate role,'' it said.
   ``If the enterprises' party organizations are divorced from the
important activities of production and business ... How can they
guarantee and supervise the implementation of party and government
policies?''
   If the party concentrates just on running itself, the paper
said, ``it can't be a political party, it can only be an
after-hours mass organization or a club.''
   It added ominously, ``As party general secretary, how could
Comrade Zhao Ziyang not know the party's nature and role? His
purpose in putting forward the idea that the party only run itself
is very clear. ... Because of his erroneous stance ... the party's
work organization and full-time working staff have been slashed,
people's thoughts are in chaos, and party building and party work
have suffered great damage.''
   The 69-year-old Zhao was party chief for less than two years
when he was ousted in June after losing a power struggle triggered
by handle massive student-led demonstrations for a freer society.
   He has not been seen in public since May, but party and
government officials say he is living comfortably at his home in
party headquarters in Zhongnanhai in central Beijing.
   At a news conference in September, his successor, Jiang Zemin,
said Zhao had made contributions as party secretary and,
previously, as premier. Although Jiang did not say what Zhao's fate
would be, his mild tone was taken as an indication that he was not
likely to be put on trial for his alleged mistakes.
   When he was ousted, the party said he had supported the protests
and split the party.

   Abortion is bound to wither away in America as
a political issue, some observers say, just as soon as the French
``abortion pill'' crosses the Atlantic, either legally or illegally.
   ``People on either side of the argument are spending a lot of
energy and emotion on a political issue that's going to be
defused,'' says Leonard A. Cole, who teaches in the Science,
Technology and Society Program at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J.
   Even if the French pill doesn't win the right to be marketed in
the United States, it is bound to be smuggled in and come into
widespread use, adds Cole, who has looked into the likely political
consequences of an at-home abortion pill.
   Wayne Barden, vice president of the Population Council, says
that with the new drug abortion will become a private decision in
which even the woman taking the pill may not know whether a
pregnancy had occured. That is ``what the anti-abortion people are
afraid of,'' he says.
   And Werner Fornos, president of the Population Institute, says
the French pill ``will make the entire issue moot. It will take the
judgmental community out of play.''
   RU486, the abortion pill, has been given to 25,000 French women
with a success rate of 96 percent in the year it has been
available, according to its developer.
   The National Right to Life Committee predicts it can keep the
abortion pill from being made or sold in this country, through a
boycott of pharmaceutical companies if nothing else.
   ``It is going to be very difficult to find,'' predicts Richard
Glasow, education director of the committee.
   He sees RU486 as a ``dangerous drug'' which is being sold in
France because ``the socialist government in France is
ideologically committed to it.''
   But in the United States, he says, ``public opinion will be
against taking such a dangerous drug.''
   Glasow concedes the anti-abortion movement can do little to keep
pills from being smuggled into the country.
   ``There is going to be a certain number of people who disobey
the law,'' Glasow says.
   ``Certainly if it is illegal there will (still) be people who
use it,'' adds Gary Bauer, former domestic policy adviser to
President Reagan.
   The National Organization for Women and the Fund for the
Feminist Majority predict RU486 will come into use in this country
within five years and say the only remaining question ``is whether
it will come legally, and therefore be administered safely under a
doctor's supervision, or illegally, with increased risk for women.''
   Cole sees an analogy to the effort in the 1950s to block the
sale of birth control devices. The instant the birth control pill
came into widespread use, he says, the battle against contraception
effectively ended.
   ``Eventually somebody is going to see the profit potential (of
RU486) as large enough to overcome the worries and the political
opposition that any pill producer is bound to face,'' he says.
   A society that cannot keep tons of cocaine from finding a market
cannot keep an abortion pill out, he adds.
   Etienne-Emile Bauliueu, developer of RU486, predicted earlier
this month that Americans ``will find ways'' to have the pill
distributed here.
   Baulieu said the pill should be taken under medical supervision.
He said it can ``give more privacy to the decision of pregnancy
interruption.''
   RU486 is a synthetic chemical that, when taken within the first
seven weeks of pregnancy, induces an abortion by causing the uterus
to shed the egg. Often it must be used with a second compound,
requiring two visits to a doctor.
   Its French manufacturer, Roussel Uclaf, is not seeking to sell
licenses to market the drug in the United States and no application
for testing is before the Food and Drug Administration.

<HEAD>Militant Jewish Group Plans to Lay Cornerstone for New Temple</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of militant Israelis is preparing to
lay a three-ton cornerstone next week in hopes of eventually
rebuilding the ancient Jewish Temple, angering Arabs and some
fellow Jews.
   ``This is the answer to the intefadeh (Palestinian uprising) and
the answer to those who are trying to destroy us,'' Gershon
Salomon, chairman of the Temple Mount Faithful movement, said
Wednesday.
   The group wants to rebuild the temple that was destroyed by the
Romans in 70 A.D. An earlier temple, built by King Solomon, was
destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C.
   Such a plan is provocative because the 35-acre site where the
ancient temples stood includes the spot where Moslems believe the
prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   The platform's two mosques, the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa,
are the holiest Islamic places of worship after Mecca and Medina in
Saudi Arabia.
   The Temple Mount Faithful initially planned to lay the
cornerstone on the platform, but police denied them permission,
Salomon said. Instead, the cornerstone will be placed ``in the
meantime'' near the ramp leading to the Moghrabi Gate of the mount,
he said.
   The ceremony is scheduled for Monday.
   Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi Sandori confirmed the Temple
Mount Faithful has permission for a ceremony near the gate.
   ``If it causes a disturbance or damage, we will of course stop
them,'' Sandori said.
   Adnan Husseini, director general of the Moslem trust that
administers the mosques, said he did not know what Moslem reaction
would be.
   ``They know well that the Moslems know how to take care of their
mosques,'' Husseini said. ``The police and God will save the
mosques because they are for people praying.''
   Rabbi Richard G. Hirsch, executive director of the World Union
for Progressive Judaism, the international office for Reform
Judaism, criticized Salomon and his movement.
   ``I consider their version of Judaism to be a perversion of
Judaism and their acts to be a retrogressive negative force,'' he
told The Associated Press.
   He added: ``We consider any attempt at this time to inject an
issue such as a reconstruction of a Temple in Jerusalem to be a
negative, divisive, deleterious force.''
   A spokesman for Conservative Jews said Salomon and his group
were motivated by politics, not religion.
   ``He is attempting to make a political provocation, and we are
very opposed to this,'' said Rabbi Ehud Bandel, director of the
Conservative Movement's education and outreach department.
   Salomon said he did not care what the Arab reaction would be.
   ``I don't want to hear an answer from the Arabs,'' he said. ``We
think that the Arab period in Israel and on the Temple Mount has
come to an end.''

   A U.S.-Soviet pact reducing strategic nuclear
arms is unlikely before President Bush's summit next year with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a leading House Republican
said Wednesday.
   Rep. William S. Broomfield of Michigan, ranking GOP member on
the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said unresolved issues will
delay a superpower agreement.
   Broomfield recently met with arms control negotiators during a
congressional delegation's trip to Geneva. He based his comments on
statements made by the Soviets negotiators, including the chief
negotiator, Yuriy Nazarkin.
   ``The Soviet negotiators view the likelihood (of a START treaty)
as very doubtful'' prior to the summit scheduled for late spring or
early summer next year, Broomfield said in an interview.
   The lawmaker said a number of ``troubling'' problems still have
to be worked out. He declined to provide specifics.
   However, Broomfield said he is optimistic that a U.S.-Soviet
agreement will be reached to slash the superpowers' store of
long-range nuclear missiles by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   ``Eventually,'' he said. ``It won't be a rushed job ... for
signing at the summit.''
   Shortly after meetings last month in Wyoming between Secretary
of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, Bush indicated that a strategic arms control treaty
was possible.
   ``Yes, I do,'' the president said in response to questions on
the chance of a treaty. ``I think the setting of a summit will
perhaps serve as a catalyst for moving forward.
   ``But it's not a given, it's not absolutely certain that that's
going to happen. But I would agree that we have a good likelihood
that might happen,'' Bush said.

   Suspected tribal militants detonated a
bomb under a police bus in northeastern India on Wednesday, killing
11 people, news reports said. Seven of the dead were policemen.
   Press Trust of India said the blast occurred on a remote, hilly
road in Assam state's Nalbari district, 850 miles east of New Delhi.
   Besides the police, the dead were the driver of the bus and
three civilians who had hitched a ride, the news agency said.
   The bomb, detonated by remote control, was believed to have been
planted by extremists of the Bodo tribe who are fighting to set up
an independent homeland in Assam, a hilly state bordering
Bangladesh and Bhutan, the news agency said.
   The area is a militant stronghold. The tribes took to arms two
years ago, and at least 290 people have been killed in violence
this year.
   The government has refused to break up Assam into two states but
says it is willing to hold talks with the militants who allege
discrimination in jobs and education by the state's majority
non-tribal population.
   The Bodos, mostly farmers, were animists before they converted
earlier this century to Christianity and Hinduism, India's dominant
religion.
   The Bodos make up about 30 percent of Assam's 20 million people.

   Cracks are appearing in the once solid
anti-reform communist governments of East Germany and
Czechoslovakia although there's been no real progress toward
democracy, senior State Department officials said Wednesday.
   The officials pointed to recent moves by the mayors and other
authorities in Leipzig and Dresden, East Germany, to open a
dialogue with pro-democracy demonstrators as an indication
resistance may be growing to the communist government's anti-reform
stance.
   ``There seems to be some indication of a split,'' Richard
Schifter, assistant secretary of state for human rights told the
House Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``It could be that some people see the handwriting is on the
wall and prefer to go with change rather than sticking with the old
men'' who rule East Germany, Schifter said.
   Curtis Kamman, deputy assistant secretary of state for European
affairs, agreed that the mayors' action could be significant.
   ``I hope that that continues and that it represents movement,''
he said.
   Kamman said that while the role of the Communist party remains
paramount in East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria,
the ferment of the Democratic reform movement in Poland and Hungary
``cannot fail to have an impact.''
   ``Already splits are occuring in the formerly solid anti-reform
regime front in (East Germany) and Czechoslovakia, although both
still have a long way to go,'' Kamman said.
   Kamman said he believes change is so far advanced in Poland and
Hungary, where a ``genuine rebirth of politics is under way,'' that
it is difficult to see how it could be reversed.
   ``It is very hard to go in another direction unless you bring
repressive force to bear, and I don't think anyone in those
countries wants to do that,'' Kamman said.
   Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., co-chairman of the watchdog Commission
on Security and Cooperation in Europe, told the panel that despite
official resistance and oppression, ``the thousands of East Germans
marching to the American civil rights song `We Shall Overcome' ...
bring hope that independent activity will broaden and become a
powerful force for reform.''

   A human rights activist who has
gone underground failed to appear in the Brno regional court
Wednesday to appeal his sentence, witnesses said.
   Stanislav Devaty was sentenced to 20 months in prison on Aug. 29
on charges of ``inciting hostile moods in the population'' after he
was involved in ``production of printed material and organized
petitions in its support,'' the state news agency CTK said.
   Devaty, 37, was released from custody after the sentencing
pending an appeal of his conviction, and he apparently went
underground after that.
   Activist Jana Petrova brought a letter from Devaty to the Brno
court in which he said he would remain underground until the
charges were annulled, emigre sources in Vienna said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   After the sentence was pronounced, Devaty said, ``None of us
doubts that this trial should be considered a political trial.''
   Vaclav Havel, the banned playwright and unofficial leader of
Czechoslovak opposition, called Devaty's decision to go underground
``an experiment and a very respectable decision ... in continuity
with his attitude,'' speaking to reporters outside the courtroom
Wednesday.
   Devaty was initially detained March 16, as part of a mass
crackdown on dissent that included the jailing of Havel and other
leading activists.
   Devaty was tried in connection with a petition signed by more
than 400 people calling for more religious an cultural freedom and
the release of all political prisoners.
   Havel, meanwhile, said he had not known in advance about the
publication of his picture and a birthday greeting in the Communist
Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo.
   A picture of Havel appeared in the paper Saturday with an
accompanying birthday greeting to Ferdinand Vanek, a name Havel
used in some of his plays.
   The message said Havel's ``friends and colleagues thank him for
the hard work he has done and is still doing in his life, send many
greetings and wish him a lot of success in his work.'' Havel turned
53 on Oct. 5.
   Havel's picture has not appeared in the official Czechoslovak
press since the 1968 Soviet-led invasion that quashed the ``Prague
Spring'' liberalization reforms of Alexander Dubcek. It was printed
in the personal columns apparently unwittingly by the paper's
editors.
   ``I consider it a good prank, but I certainly did not do it,''
Havel said about the publication of the picture under the
pseudonym. ``It is not my habit to congratulate myself.''
   ``It was done by a group of admirers unknown to me, but I thank
them, it made me very happy,'' Havel told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.

   Virginia Kay Tippie took office Wednesday as
director of the National Ocean Service.
   Tippie, sworn in a day earlier, became the first woman to head a
division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   The service prepares the nation's nautical and aeronautical
charts, predicts tides, monitors coastal pollution, manages the
National Marine Sanctuaries and collects a wide range of coastal
and ocean data.
   Tippie had directed the agency's estuarine programs since 1986.
Before that, she directed the Environmental Protection Agency's
Chesapeake Bay Program and served as executive director of the
University of Rhode Island's Center for Ocean Management Studies.
   The ocean service is one of five NOAA divisions. The others are
the National Weather Service, National Environmental Satellite,
Data and Information Service, National Marine Fisheries Service and
the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research.

<HEAD>Jane Pauley's ``Today'' Past Noted, Her ``Today'' Future Uncertain.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With Jane Pauley's 39th birthday looming and her
13th year on ``Today'' noted, the only question Wednesday was
whether she'd stay on the top-rated, troubled morning show. Neither
she nor NBC would say.
   All NBC News would say in response to a published report that
Pauley probably would leave the show at year's end was that Pauley,
who has two years left on her contract, would stay at the network.
   ``As Jane Pauley has stated, she will be staying on with NBC
News,'' NBC said in a statement. ``Conversations about specifics
are concluding now and we expect to announce our mutual plans
shortly.''
   Pauley, who didn't return phone calls on the 13th anniversary of
her joining the show, reportedly has been upset over changes at
``Today,'' including a switch of news anchors in which ``NBC News
at Sunrise'' anchor Deborah Norville last month was made the
``Today'' news anchor.
   That job had been held by John Palmer, a former White House
correspondent, since 1982. He now anchors the earlier ``Sunrise.''
   There has been speculation, about which NBC won't comment, that
Norville is being considered as the next ``Today'' co-anchor. She
was given a five-year contract in August.
   Peggy Hubble, an NBC News spokeswoman, declined to say Wednesday
when or if Pauley will be leaving ``Today,'' which she co-anchors
with Bryant Gumbel.
   ``We're discussing her role with NBC News,'' Hubble said. As for
``Today'' and Pauley, she said, ``I think it's premature to make
any specific announcement.'' She said she didn't know when one
would be made.
   NBC News president Michael Gartner, NBC Sports president Dick
Ebersol, who oversees ``Today,'' and Pauley's agent, Ralph Mann,
did not return calls. Secretaries said the three executives were
out.
   Pauley, who turns 39 on Oct. 31, succeeded Barbara Walters, the
first female co-anchor of ``Today,'' in 1976.
   At that time, Walters left to join ABC after 15 years on
``Today,'' on which she started as a writer. She now co-anchors
``20-20'' for ABC News and celebrity-interview specials for ABC
Entertainment.
   Both Pauley and Norville, 31, came to NBC News after anchor work
at NBC-owned WMAQ-TV in Chicago. Norville joined NBC in January
1987.
   Gumbel started Wednesday's ``Today'' broadcast by noting that
Pauley began on the show 13 years ago that day. ``That's a long
time. Is that a lifetime?'' he asked her.
   ``It's a long time. It's my whole adult life, virtually,''
Pauley responded. ``Thank you.''

   Democrat Douglas Wilder is on the offensive in
the Virginia governor's race with a groundbreaking television
commercial on abortion that challenges a decade of political wisdom.
   ``Marshall Coleman wants to take away your right to choose and
give it to the politicians,'' says the announcer, while the screen
shows pictures of the American flag and a statue of Thomas
Jefferson. ``He wants to go back to outlawing abortion _ even in
cases of rape and incest.''
   Wilder's ad _ attacked by Coleman as an attempt to ``spread
fear'' _ is crafted to appeal to conservatives as well as liberals
by framing the abortion issue as one of personal liberty and
freedom of choice.
   His decision to focus on abortion challenges recent trends in
which the issue has played a major role in defeating several
Democratic candidates. And in an off-year campaign season, Wilder's
approach is being watched closely, especially in the wake of a
Supreme Court ruling that permits states to put greater
restrictions on abortions.
   Each side in the bitter abortion debate claims it is gaining
strength after the court decision, with pro-choice groups saying
their supporters will be energized by the threat of greater
restrictions.
   The issue is being played out in other campaigns, as well.
   New Jersey's GOP gubernatorial candidate James Courter has
softened his anti-abortion position. In New York, Republican
mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani has moderated his views, as
well, to the point where Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor has
publicly criticized unnamed candidates who engage in ``what I
consider political evasion.''
   The Florida Legislature, called into special session by
Republican Gov. Bob Martinez to consider stricter limits on
abortion, swiftly killed a series of anti-abortion measures and
headed for adjournment Wednesday without approval of any of the
governor's proposals.
   ``If anything, it's a moment of sadness,'' Martinez said.
   ``A right, having been established, is not easily removed,''
said House Speaker Tom Gustafson, a Democrat.
   But the most dramatic test is unfolding in Virginia, where
Wilder is trying to become the first black ever elected to govern a
state.
   ``Ultimately this will hurt Wilder,'' says David O'Steen,
executive director of the National Right to Life Committee. said.
``There are more people against abortion than for abortion.''
   But Frank Greer, Wilder's Washington campaign consultant who
made the commercial, says otherwise.
   ``There are those who would say don't go out an a limb on the
abortion issue because it's a liberal issue,'' said Greer. ``I
think it's a very conservative issue.''
   Coleman won a tough Republican primary emphasizing his
opposition to abortion in nearly all cases, excepting only those
where a mother's life is endangered by pregnancy. And after winning
the nomination, Coleman said he would not press an earlier pledge
to try to outlaw abortions arising from rape and incest and in most
other cases, saying there was no chance the legislature would pass
such a law.
   Wilder has said he supports keeping Virginia's abortion laws,
which generally impose few restrictions, although he has said he
might sign a law requiring parental consent for abortions on minors.
   The Virginia race has mobilized national interest groups. The
National Abortion Rights Action League, an abortion rights group,
has run full-page newspaper ads and is beginning its own
independent television ad campaign attacking Coleman.
   The National Right to Life Committee is at work in Virginia but
is staying out of the New Jersey race, said executive director
O'Steen. He said his group is airing television ads around
Virginia, except in the affluent Northern Virginia suburbs of
Washington.
   Wilder's commercial is directed at the state's conservative
resistance to government intrusion in personal affairs in what
Greer says is an effort to tap the same vein as a campaign against
gun-control laws might.
   ``In Virginia, we have a strong tradition of freedom and
individual liberty _ rights that are now in danger in the race for
governor,'' the announcer says in the ad. ``Doug Wilder believes
that government shouldn't interfere in your right to choose. He
wants to keep the politicians out of your personal life. Don't let
Marshall Coleman take us back.''
   Independent public opinion polls have shown a trend in Wilder's
direction in the three weeks since he began airing the commercial.
His campaign has spent more than $500,000 airing the ad so far, and
he plans another on the subject.
   Meanwhile, Coleman has begun to fight back.
   In a statewide televised debate Monday, Coleman made an issue of
Wilder's ad and charged the Democrat was trying to ``to spread fear
_ fear from a single, divisive issue.''
   Wilder's campaign and national Democratic observers say their
polling in Virginia shows 60 percent support for maintaining
abortion rights _ and that that figure has grown by 10 percentage
points since Wilder began airing his ad.
   A decade ago, abortion was used as an issue against several
incumbent Democratic senators who were denied re-election. With the
emergence of Ronald Reagan in 1980 as the Republican presidential
nominee, the GOP platform took its strongest stand ever against
abortion.
   But the abortion debate has taken on a new political intensity
across the country since the Supreme Court's ruling in a case last
July.
   In that Missouri case, the court stopped short of reversing its
1973 decision upholding abortion rights, but gave the states leeway
in imposing regulations on most abortions.

<HEAD>Soviet TV Shows Report on Voronezh `Aliens'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet TV viewers Wednesday night got a chance to
see the aliens that created a cosmic sensation with their reported
landing in the town of Voronezh _ but only in a child's scribbled
drawing.
   The Soviet nightly news program ``Vremya'' broadcast a report
from Voronezh showing the spot among yellow-leaved birches where,
according to the official news agency Tass, scientists confirmed an
unearthly craft had touched down.
   The picture, by a child who claimed to have witnessed the
landing, showed a glowing two-legged sphere with a smiling stick
figure inside.
   Tass made a worldwide splash Monday with its straight-faced
report on towering, pin-headed aliens who emerged from a spaceship
that landed in a park in Voronezh, 300 miles southeast of Moscow.
Since then, scientists have disparaged the report and attributed it
to rising sensationalism in the Soviet press under ``glasnost,'' or
greater openness.
   The ``Vremya'' report, although more skeptical in tone than that
by Tass, offered without comment an interview with schoolboy Vasya
Surin, a purported witness to the ``close encounter.''
   ``We were scared,'' said Vasya, who appeared to be about 11.
``It hovered over this tree. Then the door opened and a tall person
of about three meters (three yards) looked out. He didn't have a
head, or shoulders either. He just had a kind of hump. There he had
three eyes, two on each side and one in the middle.''
   Vasya said the alien had two holes instead of a real nose, and
could not turn his head, so he had to swivel his middle eye.
   An aviation engineer from a nearby factory said he and his
colleagues measured the landing area and found an intense magnetic
field there.
   But the ``Vremya'' report concluded with some of the many
factors that detract from the credibility of the sighting:
   _ No adult witnesses could be found even though a large
apartment house overlooked the site.
   _ The story spread only a week after the supposed event when an
article appeared in the local newspaper.
   _ Supposed alien minerals turned out to be of the earthly type.
   ``Only one thing is clear,'' concluded Soviet TV reporter L.
Maximov. ``It's early to tell. What's needed is research. And not
by Voronezh enthusiasts, but by experts.''

<HEAD>Inmates Lay Trail of False Clues of `Escape,' Hide in Prison</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JUDY DAUBENMIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LANSING, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two inmates planted false clues hinting
that they had escaped from the world's largest walled prison and
then hid inside the facility for a week while authorities conducted
a three-state, $100,000 manhunt.
   The two men concealed themselves in a four-foot hollowed-out
stack of boxes and apparently planned to scale the walls of the
State Prison of Southern Michigan at Jackson when the search died
down, said Department of Corrections spokeswoman Gail Light.
   However, Detective Sgt. Jerry Boyer said Wednesday no one is
red-faced about falling for the ploy by David Bellah, 42, and
Steven Mikko, 27, who were found Tuesday after officials were
tipped to their hiding place.
   ``I'm not embarrassed in the least bit. We had information to
believe these guys were outside and we followed up on it,'' he
said. `` ... If you have a crow pie that you want me to eat, I'd be
glad to.''
   Boyer estimated state police spent more than $100,000 searching
for the inmates within Michigan. The search extended to Indiana and
Nevada, where Bellah and Mikko had friends and relatives.
   The two, discovered missing on Oct. 4 during a routine count,
were thought to have walked out disguised as guards, Boyer said,
because negatives left in their cells indicated they had made false
badges and a note said they had bought guard uniforms for $250.
   Mikko also arranged for a cousin who lived in the area to call a
probation officer to say she had been asked to pick up the two on
the day of the reported escape in Rives Junction, about 10 miles
north of Jackson, Boyer said.
   ``It certainly leads a reasonable person to believe they had
escaped from prison,'' said Boyer, adding that the size of the
57-acre institution made it difficult to search it thoroughly.
   Light said prison officials were suspicious and received several
tips that the two were still inside the prison.
   ``The evidence left in the cell was so obvious we had some
doubts whether it was legitimate evidence or whether they were
trying to distract us,'' she said. Light declined to reveal the
source of Tuesday's tip that paid off.
   ``We searched the prison every single day and continuously since
they left. We never stopped looking for these guys,'' said Marcia
Bailey, administrative assistant to the warden at Jackson.
   Bellah was convicted of killing a Lansing police officer during
a 1977 bank robbery. Mikko is serving 25-40 years on an armed
robbery conviction in Montcalm County.
   The two went undetected in a hollowed out, four-foot stack of
boxes in a furniture factory on the prison grounds even though the
area had been searched with tracking dogs, Bailey said.
   Light said a spring mechanism allowed the men to tighten the
metal strap on the outside of the stack to make it appear the stack
of boxes was solid.
   The pair had a homemade grappling hook and 84 feet of rope made
from nylon laundry bags. They apparently intended to scale the
28-foot prison wall, she said.
   The two had a supply of apples, candy bars and water, and
officials speculated that other inmates brought them food, Light
said.
   Bailey said the men were armed with crude knives but offered no
resistance when found.
   They are being held in administrative segregation and Bailey
said they will face misconduct hearings. They could be placed in a
higher custody level and have time outside their cells restricted.
   Before the escape, the men were listed as ``close custody''
prisoners, a level below maximum security, and could leave their
cells during the day for work and recreation.
   Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney Joseph Filip said no
criminal charges will be filed. The potential two- to five-year
sentences would have less impact than prison disciplinary steps, he
said, noting Bellah already is serving a mandatory life sentence.
   Authorities said Mikko had attempted escapes at least twice
before.

   Two pregnant women who tested positive
for drug use have been jailed on charges of distributing cocaine to
a minor _ their fetuses _ in the first such use of the law in South
Carolina, prosecutors said.
   They were arrested after efforts to counsel them on drug abuse
failed, authorities said.
   ``This was not taken as a first step,'' said police Capt. Robert
H. Roberts. ``It was taken as a last resort.''
   Monica V. Young, 18, of Charleston, and Lori Griffin, 26, of
McClellanville, were arrested after urine samples taken at a
hospital where they went after experiencing abdominal pains turned
up cocaine, police said.
   They were charged with distribution of cocaine to minors and
possession of cocaine. They remained in jail today on $80,000 bail.
   Police said they made the arrests to safeguard the fetues.
Babies born to cocaine addicts can suffer permanent damage and are
thought to be prone to seizures, irritability and poor social
development, medical experts say.

   NASA on Wednesday tentatively
rescheduled the launch of Atlantis for Tuesday as technicians began
the laborious job of replacing the faulty engine computer that
scrubbed the flight.
   ``There is a 50-50 chance of completing the necesary work'' in
time for a Tuesday launch, a statement said. It said shuttle
managers would meet at noon Saturday to decide whether to aim for
that date or to try for Wednesday.
   A launch Tuesday, five days later than the original launch date,
would take place during a 24-minute period beginning at 12:57 p.m.
   The launch date for Atlantis and five astronauts with a
nuclear-powered planetary package will depend on how work
progresses in swapping and checking the master control computer in
main engine No. 2.
   Technicans opened Atlantis' cramped engine compartment Wednesday
and set up work platforms so they could gain access to the bad
computer. It is to be removed and a new one installed Friday.
   ``It's a crowded place to work and it's not easy,'' said Bob
Crippen, head of a Mission Management Team which set the new launch
date. Officials had said earlier that Monday was the earliest
possible date.
   The delay was announced Tuesday night just 90 minutes after a
federal judge rejected a request by three anti-nuclear groups to
halt the flight. The groups claimed the shuttle's Jupiter-bound
Galileo payload could scatter its radioactive plutonium fuel over
Florida if there were an accident during launch.
   NASA wants to launch Atlantis and get Galileo on its way as soon
as possible because Jupiter will be in the proper position only
until Nov. 21; any delay beyond that would put the space probe's
flight off until mid-1991.
   Atlantis' commander, Donald Williams, said Wednesday he was
disappointed the launch was postponed but said he agreed with the
decision because ``safety is an overriding concern.''
   He spoke to reporters before he and his four crew members flew
back to their training base in Houston to rehearse in a shuttle
simulator. They plan to return here two days before the new launch
day.
   ``We understand what happened and why and we concur
wholeheartedly and sincerely in the decision,'' Williams said. ``In
manned space flight, we obviously take a great deal of effort to
make everything fail-safe. We should never, ever deviate from
that.''
   At launch pad 39B, technicians were working on a schedule aimed
at completing computer removal, replacement and checkout by late
Saturday.
   Once the task is completed, NASA could resume the countdown,
which was halted at the 19-hour mark. More than 15 hours of hold
time is built into the count in case of contingencies, so the
countdown time remaining is about 34 hours.
   The computer, which weighs 230 pounds and is about the size of a
17-inch portable television, controls all functions on one of the
shuttle's three main engines during liftoff.
   It became necessary to remove the device, called a master
controller, when engineers were unable to determine why it had
given a false fuel pump pressure reading.
   Shuttle workers received the bad news not long after U.S.
District Judge Oliver Gasch ruled in Washington that they could
proceed with launch preparations.
   ``The court concludes that NASA has complied with requirements
of the National Environmental Protection Act,'' Gasch said.
   Justice Department attorneys representing the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration argued that Galileo's $1.5
billion, six-year mission to Jupiter carried very low risks. They
said the nuclear generators were well shielded and similar to 38
generators that have flown on 22 previous space missions.
   Gasch's ruling came on a request for a temporary restraining
order, a ruling that can't be appealed. The plaintiffs said they
were going back to Gasch to seek a preliminary injunction, whose
refusal can be appealed.
   The anti-nuclear groups said that if they lost in court they
would try to halt the launch by infiltrating Kennedy Space Center
on launch day.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Travels Cost Twice As Much as Predecessor: Justice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh's trips cost
the government more than twice as much as those taken by his
predecessor during a nearly comparable period, the Justice
Department said Wednesday.
   Thornburgh's 47 trips aboard government aircraft between Oct. 7,
1988, and Sept. 4 cost $154,618, compared with $74,247 Attorney
General Edwin Meese spent during his last 10 months in office,
according to records furnished by spokesman David Runkel.
   Runkel attributed much of the increased expense to three flights
aboard U.S. Marshals Service airplanes that cost $80,171.
   ``The only difference is when you include the incredible charges
of the Marshals Service,'' he said.
   Travel records show that a Marshals Service twin-engine jet flew
from Oklahoma City to Pittsburgh on May 16 to pick up Thornburgh at
9:40 a.m. and fly him back to Washington at a cost of $5,260.
   The night before, Thornburgh had flown from Washington to
Pittsburgh aboard an FBI turboprop plane. That trip cost $730,
according to FBI records.
   While in Pittsburgh, Thornburgh voted in the Pennsylvania
primary, spoke to FBI agents at the local field office and was
interviewed by radio station KDKA.
   A letter the Marshals Service's public affairs chief, Stephen T.
Boyle, wrote last week to two news organizations detailing the
expenses said the plane for the Pittsburgh-to-Washington flight was
requested May 12.
   Boyle said he didn't know why Thornburgh requested the plane.
   Thornburgh's tab at the Marshals Service also includes $46,792
for an Aug. 6-9 trip to Mexico City for a meeting with Mexican
officials and to Honolulu where the attorney general addressed the
American Bar Association convention, according to Boyle's letter,
written in response to queries by The New York Times and Los
Angeles Times.
   Runkel made Boyle's letter and a similar response by FBI
spokesman Milt Ahlerich available to reporters.
   Thornburgh and five aides flew aboard a Marshals Service Boeing
727 airliner from San Francisco to Honolulu because the plane used
during the earlier legs of the trip was unable to fly non-stop from
the West Coast to Hawaii, Runkel said.
   The Boeing 727, normally used to transport prisoners, was
pressed into service because another plane that Thornburgh
originally planned to use for the entire trip had broken down
before he left Washington, Runkel said.
   A June 12-14 trip to Texas aboard a twin-engine Marshals Service
jet that flew from Oklahoma City to Washington to pick up
Thornburgh and several aides cost $28,118. The airplane was
requested two weeks in advance, according to Boyle's letter.
   The expense of the attorney general's travels also included what
it cost for aides to accompany him on the trips, Runkel said.
   Runkel said he didn't understand why the Marshals Service
billing system makes flights on its planes significantly more
expensive than those aboard FBI aircraft.
   Boyle said the Justice Department's management division ``went
over the bills in some detail before they reimbursed us to
determine if they were indeed valid and justifiable and apparently
felt they were because they paid the bill'' for all three flights.
   The Marshals Service includes the cost of fuel, Boyle said.
   The figures for Meese's travels covered the period from Oct. 1,
1987, until he left office Aug. 8, 1988. Runkel said $62,000 of the
$74,247 was for trips aboard FBI aircraft. Meese flew on commercial
airlines for the other trips.
   Runkel did not have figures for the number of trips Meese took.
   The total figures provided by Runkel include an additional three
weeks for Thornburgh, during which he spent $5,256 on travel.
   Thornburgh has been flying aboard government aircraft on the
advice of the FBI, which determined that his security
communications could not be guaranteed aboard commercial flights,
Runkel said.
   Thornburgh has traveled frequently because he wants to speak to
groups of federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials around
the country, Runkel said.
   ``That's part of his job to speak about what the Department of
Justice is doing,'' Runkel said.

<HEAD>St. Paul Suburb to Ban Cigarette Machines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE BEAR LAKE, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette vending machines will be
snuffed out in this St. Paul suburb in 90 days by an ordinance
passed by the city council, a move one health expert calls the
first of its kind in the country.
   The measure, passed 4-1 Tuesday, calls for the removal of the 19
cigarette vending machines in bars, gas stations, convenience
stores and apartment and office buildings in this town of 24,000.
   The law was backed by the city Fire Department, several
University of Minnesota researchers, the White Bear Lake School
Board and a coalition of business leaders.
   ``We believe White Bear Lake is the first city in the country to
ban cigarette vending machines,'' Jean Forster, assistant professor
of public health at the University of Minnesota, said after the
vote.
   Council member Bill Bennis, in casting his dissent, said,
``Machines are not attacking the real problem. If merchants are
sincere about this, they'd take cigarettes out of their place of
business.''
   A local group called the Tobacco Free Youth Project, whose
members have interviewed juvenile smokers, maintains that 93
percent get their cigarettes from machines.
   Nationally, an estimated 3.5 million youngsters ages 12 to 17
consume $1 billion in tobacco a year. Past studies have indicated
that half of all smokers begin at age 13.
   Eighteen months ago, White Bear Lake police started arresting
juveniles caught smoking in public. So far, 155 teen-agers have
been arrested and ordered to attend a two-night lecture and
discussion session at the White Bear Lake Community Counseling
Center.
   Of that group, just a handful were caught a second time and sent
back for another dose of counseling, authorities said. About two
dozen youths who failed to report for counseling were fined $25 to
$100 in juvenile court.

<HEAD>HUD Review Questions $4.7 Million in Spending By Housing Agency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigators have asked the San
Antonio Housing Authority to account for $4.7 million in
questionable spending and repay $84,260 used to finance such items
as Rotary Club memberships and banquets.
   In a review dated Oct. 3 by the inspector general's office at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development, investigators said
there were possible violations of law or conflicts of interest in
several areas, including procurement and contracting practices and
the use of non-profit corporations.
   The report said the agency may have spent $3.8 million alone on
questionable contracts, including goods and services obtained
without competitive bidding.
   The agency may have also overpaid one of its non-profit
corporations at least $255,344 for windows, screens and doors, the
review said. The remainder of the questioned spending included such
items as unsupported payment vouchers and $129,000 in paid sick
leave.
   Apolonio Flores, the housing agency's executive director,
disputed each of the 14 separate allegations. He defended the use
of low-income housing funds for a Rotary membership, the
soliciation of $1,800 in donations from contractors and businesses
for a Hispanic chamber of commerce mixer, and said the non-profit
corporations saved the agency $3 million.
   ``There's nothing we're not prepared to defend,'' Flores said.
He accused HUD investigators of not examining his agency's records
or talking with his staff, although there were seven or eight or
them in San Antonio for about three months.
   The report said two of the agency's non-profit corporations
realized receipts over expenses _ mostly through transactions
between the corporations and federally funded housing programs for
the poor _ but did not pass those savings on to low-income projects.
   As a result, the housing authority ``may not have operated its
housing projects in the manner prescribed by Texas state law and a
conflict of interest may have occured,'' the review said.
   As of Jan. 31, the San Antonio Housing Assistance Corp. had a
balance of $285,922 while the San Antonio Housing Facilities Corp.
had a balance of $1.2 million and investments totaling nearly $4.8
million.
   Under Texas law, the report said, there does not appear to be
any provision for the San Antonio housing authority to maintain
such a fund balance.
   ``Accordingly, the SAHAC might be required to use any excess of
reciepts over expenses soley to make decent, safe and sanitary
housing available for persons of low income,'' the review said.
   The report also said the housing authority, through the San
Antonio Housing Facilities Corp., purchased a private housing
project for $1.13 million that rents to non-low income individuals
and families. Under Texas law, however, a housing authority may
rent or lease housing only to people of low income.
   Of the $84,260 that the inspector general has recommended the
agency be required to repay, $73,857 was charged to federal
programs for such items as banquets, computer hardware and office
furniture for the low-income housing projects, Rotary Club
membership fees, and tax handbooks and publications.
   Another $1,800 was improperly solicited from businesses and
contractors to pay for the chamber mixer in October 1988, the
report said.
   The investigators made their recommendations for action to the
HUD regional administrator in Fort Worth. The authority has 60 days
to respond to the review, while the administrator has six months to
decide how to proceed.

<DATELINE>MAUMERE, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II crossed the
Indonesian archipelago on Wednesday to take his pilgrimage to
Flores, the ``island of flowers,'' a Catholic stronghold in a sea
of Islam.
   The pope flew in a C-130 military transport after changing
planes in Dili, giving him a preview of his stop Thursday in East
Timor. Indonesian authorities had erected a billboard at the
airport with a picture of the pontiff and President Suharto that
says ``Welcome Pope John Paul II to Timor, Indonesia's 27th
Province.''
   Indonesian forces invaded the former Portuguese territory in
late 1975 and annexed it the following year.
   The dusty island of Flores prepared for days for the papal
visit, being overwhelmingly Catholic in the world's most populous
Moslem country. The Vatican estimates nearly 85 percent of Flores'
663,000 residents are Catholics.
   Roman Catholics number about 5 million in Indonesia, compared to
the 157 million Moslems.
   Lying offshore was an Indonesian warship, part of security
precautions for the pope's overnight stop. Church officials
expected about 250,000 people at a papal Mass in a soccer stadium.
   The pope told them Catholics can play an important role in
Indonesia.
   ``You understand the enormity of the task facing your country in
providing better education and training, more jobs and just wages,
and a more equitable distribution of the advantages of economic and
cultural development,'' he said.
   ``Your Christian faith urges you to be involved in this great
undertaking.''
   The pope flew 940 miles eastward from Jakarta to reach this
island that was first settled by Portuguese and Dutch explorers.
   Meanwhile, news reports in Lisbon, Portugal, said Wednesday that
nationalist rebels fighting Indonesian rule in East Timor called a
5-hour cease-fire in their 14-year-old guerrilla struggle while
John Paul visits the Southeast Asian territory.
   Abilio Araujo, a Lisbon-based official of the Revolutionary
Front for an Independent East Timor, or FRETILIN, said the
movement's central committee called the truce at a clandestine
meeting Tuesday in central Timor, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported.
   Araujo said the rebels called on their Catholic supporters to
attend the papal Mass and pray for withdrawal of Indonesian troops
from the territory.
   The Vatican does not recognize the annexation of East Timor and
has continued to keep the bishop of Timor under its direct control.
He is not a member of Indonesia's conference of bishops.
   John Paul's decision to visit the territory touched off
controversy. FRETILIN officials said the trip implies a tacit
recognition of the occupation.
   However, the pope told reporters accompanying his Asian tour
that to skip the territory would be an ``offense'' to East Timor's
Catholics.
   Human rights groups estimate about 100,000 Timorese have died
from fighting, famine or disease since the Indonesian invasion.
   Under international law, Portugal is still the administrative
power in East Timor.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Congressman Used Wedtech Like a Bank Machine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VERA HALLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia and his wife used the
Wedtech Corp. like a personal bank, trading the congressman's
political influence for payoffs and interest-free loans, a
prosecutor charged Wednesday.
   ``The Garcias were greedy. They wanted something more from this
office than the satisfaction of doing good for the public,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Michele Hirshman in closing arguments at
the Garcias' bribery and extortion trial.
   ``In doing so, they corrupted it, abused it, misused it, sold
it,'' she said.
   The defense painted a different picture in its summation,
telling the 12 jurors in Manhattan federal court to acquit the
Garcias by rejecting testimony from the prosecution's star witness,
former Wedtech vice chairman Mario Moreno.
   ``There are many reasons to doubt Moreno's testimony _ reasons
based on lies, told and untold crimes and his willingness to do
anything to evade justice,'' said Ronald Fischetti, the lawyer for
Jane Lee Garcia.
   Fischetti said Moreno, who pleaded guilty to theft- and
bribe-related charges in 1987 and testified at other Wedtech
trials, was a ``perjurer, liar and thief.''
   Garcia, a 56-year-old Bronx Democrat, and his wife are accused
of conspiring to obtain $185,000 in checks and interest-free loans,
and a diamond and emerald necklace for Mrs. Garcia, from officials
of the now-defunct Wedtech Corp.
   Their trial is the last of several to stem from the scandal at
Wedtech, the small South Bronx machine shop that grew into a
multimillion-dollar defense contractor through various bribe
schemes. The company collapsed in 1986 amid allegations of
corruption.
   Hirshman said the relationship between Garcia and Wedtech
started out legitimately, with the congressman using his influence
to help Wedtech secure government contracts.
   This changed, she said, when financial problems prompted the
Garcias to seek money from Wedtech. The prosecutor said their
dealings turned into extortion in May 1984 when the congressman
told Moreno that his power in the House was growing and then asked
him to hire his wife.
   When Moreno balked, saying it would be improper, Mrs. Garcia
suggested the payments be made through a lawyer friend in Puerto
Rico, Ralph Vallone, Hirshman said.
   The prosecution claims that in 1984 through 1986, Wedtech sent
Vallone $86,100 of which $76,000 was transferred to Mrs. Garcia's
consulting firm.
   Fischetti said he did not dispute that Mrs. Garcia received
money from Vallone, but he claims the payments were for work
unrelated to Wedtech.
   Fischetti said the prosecution had presented no evidence to
support Moreno's testimony about the alleged extortion and bribery.
``There is no corroboration of illegal acts.''
   After the Vallone payments began, Hirshman said Garcia helped
Wedtech obtain a lucrative contract with the U.S. Postal Service,
``something he should have done without getting paid.''
   She said their financial problems continued in 1985, so the
Garcias returned to ``their local cash machine, the Wedtech Corp.''
for a $20,000 loan.
   Garcia instructed Moreno to make the check out to his sister,
Aimee Cortese, and she transferred the money to Mrs. Garcia's
account, Hirshman said.
   ``If this was a legitimate loan, why is Mario Moreno being told
to make the check out to Aimee Cortese?'' she asked.
   Closing arguments will continue through Thursday when U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand will instruct the jury. Deliberations
are expected to begin Friday.
   The Garcias have pleaded innocent to charges of conspiracy,
extortion, bribery and accepting illegal gratuities. If convicted
of the most serious charge, extortion, they would face up to 20
years in prison.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev does not object to
Communist parties changing their names and programs, as Hungary's
has done, the Polish party chief said Wednesday after conferring
with the Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev ``stressed that the shape and organization of any
party depends only on that party,'' Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski told a
news conference after their 3{-hour talk.
   The Hungarian party, which had been losing members and falling
in polls, voted Saturday to dissolve itself and form a
Western-style socialist organization.
   Rakowski said that example probably would be followed by the
Polish party, which lost its hold on the government in August to a
coalition led by the once-banned Solidarity trade union.
   ``I think our party also must change its program and its name,
and I think this will happen at the next party congress,'' Rakowski
said. He added that polls show such a change is favored by 70
percent of the members of the Polish United Workers Party, as the
Communists formally call themselves.
   Even the Soviet Communist Party could be transformed, but the
changes might not mirror those occurring in Eastern Europe, he said.
   ``Such changes are possible, but will depend on internal
forces'' in the Soviet Union, Rakowski declared.
   Of the Soviet leader's attitude toward Poland, which plans
Western-style economic reforms, he said: ``Gorbachev approved of
the policy of our Prime Minister (Tadeusz) Mazowiecki. That policy
is aimed at putting an end to the critical situation in our
country. I am going home satisfied.''
   On Wednesday evening, state television broadcast part of a news
conference in which Gorbachev told Polish journalists: ``After ups
and downs in the history of our relations, we are on the right
track: rapprochement and cooperation between our peoples.''
   The climate of reform has caused problems for more doctrinaire
countries in the Soviet bloc.
   Tens of thousands of of East Germans fled to the West through
Hungary to escape the strict regime and hardships in their homeland.
   Milos Jakes, head of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, expressed
concern Wednesday that recognition of opposition groups in Hungary
and Poland would lend legitimacy to banned organizations that
demand change in his country.
   He told the party Central Committee in Prague: ``We are not
indifferent to what points the way toward destruction of the
Socialist system in the friendly countries. We clearly watch these
things and draw lessons from them.''
   Rakowski repeatedly praised Gorbachev, a reformer who is both
president of the Soviet Union and head of its Communist Party.
   ``He is a brilliant counterpart who perfectly understands the
fragility of our world,'' he said. ``This has never been the case
before.''
   By contrast, he said of Karl Marx and Vladimir I. Lenin: ``We
should not kneel before the teachings of Lenin and his activities.
I am opposed to the religious attitude toward the teachings of Marx
and Lenin.''
   When asked about the likely new goals of a transformed Polish
party, however, Rakowski included a central tenet of communism:
``Even distribution of benefits.''
   He said Poland would stay in the Warsaw Pact, which he described
as a necessary alliance, but implied the Poles might become neutral
eventually.
   ``I will not forecast what will happen five or 10 years from
now,'' he said. ``The coming generation might think differently.
Unfortunately, I cannot influence their choice.''

   Three teen-agers believed to be members of a
street gang were charged Wednesday with severely beating two Jewish
students while shouting anti-Semitic slurs at them on the eve of
Yom Kippur.
   Police said the incident was motivated by ethnic hatred, and it
again raised concern over social tensions, which were heightened in
August when a white gang killed a black young man in the borough of
Brooklyn.
   Among those arrested Wednesday was the youth who police said
they believe triggered the incident, which occurred early Sunday in
Brooklyn.
   Anthony Sorrentino, 18, was charged with assault, riot,
aggravated harassment and civil rights violations, police said.
Joseph Guben, 16, and James Hynes, 17, faced assault and civil
rights charges.
   All surrendered after witnesses identified them, Deputy Chief
Joseph G. DeMartino, commander of Brooklyn detectives, said at a
news conference. He said the three, all high school students, were
believed to be members of a gang called the Kings Highway Boys.
   DeMartino said the incident began after Steven Weisburg and
Joshua Fogel, both 19, left a party at Brooklyn College. Weisburg
heard someone speak to him using an ethnic slur and confronted
Sorrentino, the deputy chief said.
   A fight broke out and eight or nine of Sorrentino's friends
jumped in, punching and kicking Weisburg and Fogel and yelling
slurs, he said. Police were seeking the other attackers.
   Police believe Sorrentino instigated the incident, DeMartino
said.
   Sorrentino's lawyer, Albert Aronne, said his client ``only tried
to defend himself when grabbed from behind'' and left before the
pair were attacked.
   Weisburg suffered a ruptured spleen and a broken leg; Fogel, a
fractured skull. A third Jewish student who tried to break up the
fight was roughed up but not hurt seriously.
   Weisburg was hospitalized in stable condition; Fogel was in good
condition.

   President Bush and NATO Secretary General
Manfred Woerner reaffirmed Wednesday a commitment to reaching an
agreement with the Warsaw Pact within a year on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   Woerner, speaking with reporters after conferring at the White
House with Bush, said, ``I think there is reason for optimism.''
   ``Even if it takes more than one year _ if it takes 14 months or
15 months _ I think you can realistically expect an agreement
soon,'' said the NATO chief.
   Bush and Woerner also discussed the dramatic changes in Eastern
Europe and the future role of NATO.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said that in
addition to reaffirming their commitment to reaching a conventional
forces agreement within six to 12 months, the two leaders
``discussed a variety of alliance issues and developments in
Eastern Europe.''
   Bush praised Woerner's leadership at a time when the alliance is
charting a new course for NATO and for giving it ``the mission of
working to overcome the division of Europe,'' Fitzwater said.
   It was at the NATO summit in Brussels last May that Bush
unveiled his proposal for a steep pullback of U.S. and Soviet
troops from Europe.
   Woerner, who also met with Vice President Dan Quayle, said, ``We
are interested in a peaceful evolution, not in unrest, not in
upheaval, not in revolution'' in Eastern Europe.
   Woerner said NATO must ``be seen as an instrument of the
political management of change in East-West relationships'' as well
as ``the major source of stability in a time of transition.''
   Woerner said he saw no danger of waning public support for NATO
in the West as expectations rise for political and economic reforms
in the Eastern Bloc.
   ``We have to explain to our publics that you can only guarantee
peace and stability as long as you have this NATO,'' he said.
   If there were ``unfortunate developments in the East,'' he said,
it is ``only as long as NATO exists, only as long as we keep up our
guard, (that) Soviet politicians know that there is only one way to
solve their problems, the peaceful one; that there is no way to go
militarily, that there is no chance for military adventures.''
   ``We try to support the forces of reform and to support (Soviet
President Mikhail) Gorbachev insofar as he opens up the society,
improves the human rights situation and allows
self-determination,'' he said.
   On the demonstrations in East Germany, Woerner said, ``we can
and will not interfere with their affairs. But as you can see,
there is strong pressure from inside towards reform and it must be
clear to the leaders of East Germany that only if they allow reform
to take place this regime will be able to develop peacefully.''
   ``If they continue like they do with their tough repression,
they will not be able to manage the change,'' he said.

   A man who was standing near the site
where his brother was fatally hit by a car was struck and killed by
a truck 35 minutes later, police said.
   ``Both accidents were attributed to pedestrians failing to yield
right-of-way to motor vehicles,'' Sgt. Brad Geary said.
   Geary identified the victims as Willie James Wright, 35, who was
hit at 8:45 p.m. Tuesday and William Charles Wright, 33, who was
struck at 9:20 p.m. Both had Fort Worth addresses, but had driver's
licenses from other states.
   Willie and his wife and William with his girlfriend were in a
truck on Interstate 30, Geary said.
   Apparently, Willie and his wife argued and they got out. As the
couple crossed the highway, Willie was hit by a car, Geary said.
When police arrived, they found William and his girlfriend still in
the pickup, apparently unaware of the accident.
   Willie was taken to Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center, where he
was pronounced dead of head injuries, Geary said.
   Officers laid out flares around the scene. Minutes later, as an
officer was moving the couples' truck, he heard a crash and saw
William had been struck by a truck about 100 feet away. William was
pronounced dead at the scene, Geary said.

<HEAD>Motion Filed to Keep Marcos Family from `Squandering' Philippines
Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for the Philippine government say
ousted president Ferdinand Marcos and others violated an injunction
prohibiting them from disposing of any of their assets, in part to
buy arms for an invasion.
   The charges are contained in a motion filed in U.S. District
Court Friday in connection with the civil case in which the
Philippine government is seeking $5 billion it says Marcos, his
family and associates looted from their country.
   The motion accused Imelda Marcos and her deceased husband's
worldwide network of bankers, agents and associates of
``liquidating, squandering and concealing assets belonging to the
Philippines'' in violation of a 1986 injunction.
   Court papers also alleged the Marcoses spent $2.8 million and
encumbered an additional $200 million in their Swiss bank accounts
to purchase arms for a planned invasion of the Philippines.
   Lawyers for the Philippines requested that a June court order be
modified to ``more closely monitor, control and account for the
Marcoses' expenditures, transactions, and assets, in order to
prevent further violations.''
   The motion alleges the Marcoses ``fraudulently transferred'' to
Saudi arms merchant Adnan Khashoggi ownership and control over two
New York buildings, four related corporations and at least one
Swiss bank account allegedly worth more than $100 million.
   The allegations against the Marcoses and Khashoggi closely
parallel some of the charges in a federal criminal indictment
brought against the trio in New York City in October 1988.

<TEXT>
   A city policeman who reported most of a
rash of fires in public buildings, including schools, in this small
town has been arrested on seven counts of arson.
   Jerry Chase, 25, of Hazlehurst, surrendered Tuesday to Copiah
County Sheriff Tommy Jackson. He was being held under $70,000 bond.
   ``He had told me they were trying to pin it on him, but I didn't
know this was going to happen,'' said Chase's brother, Andre.
   Chase was accused of setting two fires each at Hazlehurst
Elementary School and Hazlehurst High School on Sept. 21, said
Copiah County District Attorney Dunn Lampton. He also was charged
in Sept. 22 fires that damaged the courthouse and destroyed the
county welfare building.
   The seventh charge involves the Sept. 25 blaze set at a building
that houses temporary welfare offices. Someone slipped past guards
and shoved a flaming wad of newspaper behind a ceiling tile.
   Lampton said Chase became a suspect through a process of
elimination.
   ``He discovered a good many of (the fires),'' Lampton said. ``It
was just a process of the Sheriff's Department, chief of police and
the state fire marshal's office looking closely at each fire. Of
course, he was a police officer and we had the reports he wrote.''
   Public School Superintendent George C. French said guards will
remain on duty at the schools. In addition to the guards, private
security personnel were hired by the welfare office and the
county's Housing and Urban Development offices.

   An 11-foot-high hairdo and a first-rate
chin-balancing act are among the tidbits awaiting readers of the
1990 Guinness Book of World Records, which went on the market for
inquisitive minds Wednesday.
   The book is ``exploding with the most astounding facts of
nature, human endurance scientific achievement, entertainment,
business and sports,'' notes a low-key news release by the Sterling
Publishing Co.
   Take that beehive hairdo, for instance. Team Hairfax of Fairfax,
Calif., built it onto a wig. Wendy Villasenor walked around wearing
it _ in public, no less _ on July 29, 1989, ``without the wig
tilting or falling,'' the book observes.
   You say you can't believe it?
   Although it's ``amazing and amusing, Guinness is the reliable
source of accurate, fascinating facts,'' intones the publisher.
   The chin-balancing record could escape even the greatest
scholars. But Guinness readers will know that Frank Charles
balanced 24 milk crates, weighing 74 pounds, on his chin for 19
seconds at Leyton, England, on July 30, 1988.
   Next time, maybe he can heft a chicken. John Steele of Banff,
Scotland, says his rooster, named Bruno, tipped the scales at a
record 22 pounds, 1 ounce on July 4, 1989.
   ``More amazing information is packed into this exciting volume
than ever before, since more new records were set in the past year
than in any since the book was first published,'' said the
publisher.
   And if you can't cope with all that excitement, go to Boston _
the city most prolific in psychologists and psychiatrists, with
``one shrink per 328 heads.''

<HEAD>Panel Votes to Sharply Increase Aid to Poland, Hungary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without dissent, the House Foreign Affairs
Committee on Wednesday endorsed legislation authorizing $837.5
million in aid to pro-democracy movements in Poland and Hungary.
   The 35-0 vote, nearly doubling the amount proposed by President
Bush, sends the legislation to the House floor for action next week.
   Some Republican members said they were concerned about the
spending levels authorized by the bill.
   But most members of the panel said the legislation is an
appropriate and urgently needed response to democratic and
free-market trends in both Eastern European nations.
   ``Success with our help is uncertain, but failure without our
assistance is guaranteed,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., moments
before the bill was approved.
   The House bill includes the $200 million in aid to help Poland
stabilize its currency that Bush proposed last week.
   The Bush administration took no position on the bill, which
would authorize spending $837.5 million to aid Poland and Hungary
over the next three years _ $284 million of that in the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   The lion's share of the aid would go to the more populous and
economically troubled Poland.
   A Democratic proposal under consideration in the Senate calls
for making $1.25 billion available to help Poland and Hungary shift
to a free-market economy and build Democratic institutions. The
administration has proposed spending $455.5 million over the
three-year period.
   Hamilton said the House bill addresses an ``extraordinarily
unique'' opportunity to wean Eastern Europe away from communism
with the United States playing a leading role.
   ``This is an opportunity that may not come again for a long,
long time and I think we should grab it and run,'' said Rep. Robert
J. Lagomarsino, R-Calif.
   The chairman, Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., said the aid would
``lessen the impact of the instability which must take place when
you think of the enormity of the changes'' Poland and Hungary will
have to make to transform their state-run economies.
   ``I can only say that after four decades in which we spent
literally trillions of dollars to prevent the communization of
Western Europe, this is a relatively modest amount to promote the
unravelling of comminism in Eastern Europe; it is a very small
price to pay,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.
   Although several Republicans said they had problems with the
levels of spending, only Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., said he was
opposed to the entire concept of the bill.
   Roth contended the legislation does not adequately spell out how
the money would be spent and represents ``an attempt to solve the
problem by throwing money at it.''
   Roth was not present for the roll call vote.

   A Syrian major flying a Soviet-made
MiG-23 on a training mission defected to Israel Wednesday by flying
over the Golan Heights and landing at a civilian air field in
northern Israel, the Israeli army said.
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin identified it as a MiG-23 MLD _
``one of the most advanced versions of the MiG-23 supplied to the
Syrians after 1982.'' Asked if information obtained from the
aircraft would be shared with the United States, he said: ``We can
assume so.''
   Syria and Israel are archenemies and have been in a state of war
since the Jewish state was created in 1948.
   A Syrian official in Damascus said the pilot did not defect, but
ran into mechanical problems and made an emergency landing. Syria
asked the Red Cross to assist in his return.
   It was the first time a Syrian flyer was reported to have
defected to Israel, although Israeli forces have seized other
Syrian planes and received defectors from other Arab countries.
   ``This morning a Syrian pilot escaped from Syria with his plane,
a MiG-23, and he landed safely in Israel,'' said Col. Raanan
Gissin, an army spokesman.
   ``He defected to Israel and that's a fact,'' Gissin said, adding
it appeared to be ``for personal reasons.''
   Israel radio said the pilot asked for asylum. An army spokesman
said no decision on that had been announced, adding: ``At this
point we have nothing official to say. We're talking with him to
see what he wants.''
   The aircraft was ``detected by the Israeli air force and landed
here,'' Gissin said.
   He refused to say if Israeli aircraft escorted the Syrian plane
or if it penetrated sophisticated air defenses as it crossed the
Golan Heights, captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   The pilot, identified as Maj. Adel Basem, a 34-year-old
bachelor, landed about 11:15 a.m. at an airfield used by
crop-dusting planes at Megiddo, 57 miles north of Jerusalem, an
army communique said.
   There was a companion jet but an army spokesman said as far as
Israel can tell, the second jet returned to Syria.
   A witness named David Mizrahi told Israel radio he did not
realize the plane was Syrian because he saw no Israeli escort
planes.
   ``If there were accompanying planes I would have known it was
being brought down,'' he said. ``I thought it was a disguised plane
or something.''
   Mizrahi said an armed civilian drove a white Peugeot into the
airfield and confronted the Syrian flyer.
   The radio quoted other witnesses as saying the pilot raised his
hands and said, ``I have no intentions of war.''
   Rabin and armed forces chief of staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron flew
in by helicopter to meet the pilot.
   Rabin was asked three times in an interview on Israel TV how the
jet eluded Israeli border defenses, but would say only, ``All this
is being checked now.'' The Syrian official in Damascus, who spoke
on condition of anonymnity, said the pilot had to land after the
plane ``faced a technical failure.'' Other Syrian sources said
smoke poured from the aircraft's engine.
   Gissin, addressing reporters in front of the needle-nosed Syrian
aircraft, declared, ``I can categorically say there were no
technical malfunctions. It was in perfect condition when it
landed.''
   The aircraft, painted in a camouflage pattern of brown, beige
and green, was illuminated by a spotlight. Its cockpit bubble was
up. There was no outward sign the plane had caught fire.
   Gissin said the aircraft carried no ammunition or armaments
except two 23mm machine guns mounted near the cockpit.
   He said the advanced MiG-23 would be useful to both Israel and
its allies. The craft, originally developed in 1967, was believed
last updated in 1985.
   The MiG-23 is a single-seat, swing-wing fighter bomber. It has a
range of 530 miles and can carry up to 17,000 pounds in bombs and
missiles. It is a mainstay of Syria's air force, though Damascus
also has the Soviet's most advanced craft, the MiG-29.
   Nick Cook, aviation editor of the Jane's Defense Weekly in
London, said the United States is believed to have at least four
MiG-23s, obtained through Egypt, and uses them to train airmen for
dogfights.
   Brig. Gen. Oded Erez, a former head of air force intelligence,
told Israel Television much could be learned from having Israel's
pilots fly the craft and much also could be learned from the pilot.
   On Aug. 12, 1968, two Syrian pilots landed MiG-17s in Israel
because of navigational error. They were exchanged for Israeli war
prisoners in 1973, but their planes were not returned.
   Two Arab pilots defected to Israel in the past. Iraqi pilot
Munir Redfa landed in Israel in a MiG-21 on Aug. 16, 1966, and
Egyptian Hilme Mahmoud Abbas flew a Soviet-built Yak-11 training
plane into the country Jan. 19, 1964.

   The State Department on Wednesday applauded
South African government plans to release eight anti-apartheid
prisoners and urged ``the release of all political prisoners,
including Nelson Mandela.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the United
States had long regarded the freeing of political prisoners as an
important step to promote talks between the South African
government and the non-white majority in the country.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the U.S. government also welcomed President
F.W. de Klerk's meeting Wedneday with Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the
Rev. Alan Boesak, and the Rev. Frank Chikane.
   De Klerk did not say when the prisoners would be released.
   ``We are encouraged by these positive moves, and hope that they
are merely the first steps in a process which will see the release
of all political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, and the
return of political exiles, lifting of the state of emergency and
associated restrictions on political activity, and negotiations on
a peaceful transition to a nonracial and democratic South Africa,''
Ms. Tutwiler said.
   Ms. Tutwiler said South African Foreign Minister P.W. Botha
called Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Tuesday to tell him
of the government's decision. She was asked whether Botha had given
Baker any idea of when Nelson Mandela might be released.
   ``If he did, Secretary Baker did not impart that to me,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said, adding that she didn't know whether Baker planned
any further meetings with South African officials.
   Mandela is the best-known imprisoned leader of the outlawed
African National Congress.
   Ms. Tutwiler said she was unable to say whether the U.S.
government would drop some sanctions against South Africa as a
result of the freeing of the prisoners.

   Alabama Rep. Bill Dickinson said Wednesday he
did not violate House ethics rules when he accepted a one-third
interest in a $300,000 investment venture from a businessman whose
companies have done $50 million in government defense work in the
past two years.
   Dickinson, the ranking Republican on the House Armed Services
Committee, said there was ``nothing illegal, immoral or unethical
about'' his joining with industrialist Ben Collier to form the
Montgomery Investment Club in 1986.
   Dickinson said he approached Collier with ``what I thought was a
good business opportunity'' and Collier agreed to put $300,000 into
the joint venture. The agreement provided that any profits or
losses would be shared one-third by Dickinson and two-thirds by
Collier.
   Asked what he put into the venture, Dickinson replied, ``I had
the contacts.''
   House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts of more than
$100 from any individual who has a direct interest in legislation
before Congress. The House ethics committee has said the rule
applies to any individual who has a special interest ``in
influencing or affecting the federal legislative process which
sets'' him apart from the general public.
   ``If he's got a direct interest in legislation I don't know what
it is,'' Dickinson said of Collier. ``He's never asked me to vote
any way, I don't know of any legislation he's interested in and
that's as far as it goes.''
   Collier owns 45 percent of American Apparel Co., which was
formed in 1987 after Collier and several associates purchased the
assets of the bankrupt Selma Apparel Co.
   The firm now has three plants in Alabama, and according to Rick
Cippele, a part owner of the company, has received $48.6 million in
uniform contracts awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency after
competitive bidding.
   Collier also owns half interest in National Microsystems, a
Montgomery company that manufactures electronics components and
test equipment for the aerospace, automobile and appliance
industries.
   Mark Chesnutt, director of public affairs for National
Microsystems, said $3 million of the company's $9 million in total
revenue this year came from subcontracts with two major defense
contractors, United Technologies Corp. and GTE Government Systems.
   Dickinson said he has promoted National Microsystems among
defense contractors, just as he has promoted other businesses in
his district that are interested in defense subcontracting work.

   A merchant ship carrying a crew of 12 capsized in
the Arabian Sea off Oman late Wednesday, and a British destroyer
rescued 10 in the dark but two men remain missing, the Defense
Ministry said.
   The 500-ton Al Mawarid was bound from Dubai to Aden with a load
of timber when it overturned, a ministry spokesman said. The
ministry initially said it sank when the cargo shifted suddenly,
but the spokesman later said the circumstances were unclear.
   The Royal Navy destroyer HMS Manchester continued searching
through the night for the two missing crew, who are believed
trapped in the upturned hull, said the spokesman, who by custom was
not identified.
   The rescued included the vessel's captain and first officer, who
were not identified. The survivors were believed to include four
Iranians and crew from India, Oman and Dubai, the spokesman said.
   The officer of the watch on the Manchester, which was en route
to the Persian Gulf, spotted wreckage and survivors in the water
about 17 miles east of Ras al Hadd off Oman, the spokesman said.
   Six crew scrambled up nets thrown over the side of the
Manchester and two spotted clinging to chunks of wood were
recovered shortly afterwards, the spokesman said.
   A boat was launched to search the immediate vicinity and the
captain scrambled Manchester's Lynx helicopter to search further
afield while the medical officer provided first aid to the
survivors, the spokesman said.
   Lloyd's Shipping Intelligence Service said it had no reports of
the capsizing and no information on a vessel named Al Mawarid.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former White House staffer Richard C. Breeden
was designated chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
Wednesday after being sworn in as the newest member of the
regulatory agency.
   Breeden, 39, took the oath of office in a White House ceremony
attended by President Bush.
   ``Maintaining strong and competitive U.S. financial markets in
an era of global capital flows will be among my key priorities,
along with continued resolute action to prevent fraud and to
protect investors,'' Breeden said in written remarks released by
the SEC.
   Technically, Breeden is taking the seat of former SEC member
Charles C. Cox, who left office Sept. 30 to join Lexecon, a
Chicago-based consulting firm.
   But Bush designated Breeden as the 24th SEC commissioner,
replacing David S. Ruder, who also left the commission last month
to return to teaching law at Northwestern University.
   There is still a vacancy on the five-member commission, which
oversees securities markets, regulates the sale of stocks, bonds
and stock options and enforces securities laws.
   Breeden, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard Law
School, has served Bush in a variety of capacities _ most recently
as an architect of the landmark legislation to restructure the
nation's ailing savings and loan industry.
   Nominated by Bush Sept. 7, Breeden sailed through confirmation
hearings before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee a week later and was confirmed by the full Senate last
Wednesday.
   A native of Manhattan Beach, Calif., Breeden lives in the
Virginia suburbs outside Washington, D.C. with his wife, Holly, and
their three sons.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The constitutional rights of white defendants
are violated if prosecutors keep blacks off juries, the lawyer for
a white man convicted of rape argued Wednesday before the Supreme
Court.
   Cook County, Ill., public defender Donald S. Honchell wants the
court to order a new trial for Daniel Holland and to give him the
authority to object to the removal of prospective black jurors.
   Honchell faced tough questions from Justices Antonin Scalia and
Byron White, who said only the pool of jurors should be
representive of the community _ not the jury itself.
   ``You're driving up hill in this case,'' White said.
   Prosecutors, without explanation, may reject 12 prospective
jurors by using peremptory challenges. The defense also has 12
peremptory challenges.
   In Holland's case, two challenges were used to remove two
blacks, though prosecutors said the disqualifications weren't
racially motivated.
   ``It's a level playing field,'' Scalia said of the jury
selection process. ``Each side gets their peremptories. Why isn't
that a perfectly rational system?''
   ``This court,'' Honchell said, ``can utilize the Sixth Amendment
to say white defendants have a right to complain.''
   The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a fair trial.
   An all-white Cook County jury convicted Holland in 1981 of rape,
sexual assault, armed robbery and kidnapping.
   Five years later, in a case involving a black defendant and
black jurors, the Supreme Court barred prosecutors from
disqualifying potential jurors based on race.
   Holland took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court after the
Illinois Supreme Court said a white man lacks the legal standing to
challenge the exclusion of blacks from a jury.
   Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Inge Fryklund argued that
decision by the state court should stand.
   ``Petitioner Holland got exactly what the Sixth Amendment
provides,'' she said.
   The Supreme Court will issue an opinion next year.
   The American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People Legal Defense and Education
Fund support Holland.
   In a brief filed with the court, the groups cited a 1975 Supreme
Court ruling that upheld a male defendant's right to challenge the
exclusion of female jurors.
   On May 4, 1980, Holland offered a ride to a 17-year-old girl and
her boyfriend _ both white _ after the couple's car had two flat
tires. Holland then pulled a knife and told the boy to get out.
   He raped the girl, forced her to perform oral sex and stole $60
before leaving her in an alley. He was sentenced to 85 years in
prison.

<HEAD>USDA Suspends Company From Export Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY MASSEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department has suspended a
grain company from participating in a farm export program because
of the company's ties to a fugitive commodities trader in
Switzerland.
   The company, Richco Grain Ltd., has received $95 million worth
of government-owned grain as subsidies under the Export Enhancement
Program since 1986.
   USDA temporarily suspended the company effective Sept. 29
because of its connections to Marc Rich and a Rich associate,
Pincus Green. Both fled to Switzerland in 1983 before their
indictment for criminal tax evasion, racketeering, mail and wire
fraud.
   Kelly Shipp, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter, said Wednesday there was ``cause for concern'' about the
involvement as Rich and Green as company stockholders and that the
agency's inspector general was continuing to investigate.
   Robert Thomajan, an attorney for Richco, said the company would
appeal the USDA action. He declined to comment on the extent of
Rich's control over the company but maintained it was not an
adequate reason for the suspension by USDA. He said Richco had
``performed admirably'' in the export program.
   The department began investigating the company earlier this year
at the request of Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., the chairman of a
House Agriculture subcommittee that oversees the farm export
program.
   Glickman contended Richco, a Swiss-based company, should not
qualify for taxpayer-financed subsidies through EEP because Rich
appeared to exert control over Richco and share in its profits.
   USDA, according to Glickman, determined that Rich and Green, who
also lives in Switzerland and faces charges in the tax evasion
case, hold more than 51 percent of Richco's stock.
   ``He is getting a gratuity from the United States of America in
participating in this program,'' said Glickman. ``It's unbelievable
that the program could be operated so loosely.''
   Under the program, private exporters can sell U.S. commodities
at lower prices to meet foreign competition and then collect free
government grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. The
commodity bonuses are designed to go to foreign buyers to help
sweeten the deals and counter what U.S. farm groups consider unfair
trading practices by overseas competitors, particularly the
European Economic Community.
   There have been more than $8 billion in farm sales through EEP,
which was established by the 1985 farm law. At the end of July,
subsidies valued at nearly $2.6 billion had been provided through
the program.
   Although pleased that USDA acted against Richco, Glickman
criticized the agency for moving too slowly.
   ``Obviously this is a very embarrassing situation to the
department but I still don't know to this day why it took them five
months to do this,'' said Glickman.
   According to USDA, Richco has received EEP subsidies valued at
$95 million, mostly barley and wheat for sales to Saudi Arabia,
Romania, China, the Soviet Union, Colombia, Poland and India.
   Most recently, Richco picked up subsidies estimated at $277,000
for a wheat sale in May to the Soviets. Earlier this year, Richco
ranked ninth among grain exporters in amounts of EEP subsidies.
   U.S. authorities have been unable to extradite Rich from
Switzerland. The government alleges that Rich and his
commodity-trading empire cheated the Treasury out of millions of
dollars in taxes through a series of illegal oil transactions among
Rich-controlled companies. Forbes magazine has identified Rich and
Green as among the nation's wealthiest people, with each having an
estimated net worth of $775 million.

<HEAD>House Votes to Liberalize Medicaid Abortion Restrictions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 10th graf, The provision, to include requirement that rape
or incest must be promptly reported.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House agreed Wednesday to allow federally
paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest,
reversing nearly a decade of more restrictive votes and inviting a
veto from President Bush.
   By a 216-206 vote, the House rejected the language it has kept
in the law since 1981 and instead endorsed a more liberal provision
already passed by the Senate. An effort by conservatives to reverse
the vote then failed, 212-207.
   Federal aid for abortions, available under Medicaid, is now
limited to poor women whose lives have been endangered by a
pregnancy.
   Wednesday's vote came three months after a Supreme Court ruling
giving states greater powers to restrict abortions.
   Lawmakers and activists who say women have a right to an
abortion said the ruling spurred supporters of their position to
make their views known to their legislators. Opponents agreed.
   ``The political momentum on this issue is so strong now that if
President Bush vetoes this, he'd be making a big mistake,'' said
Rep. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., who led the fight for the eased
limitations.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has led the anti-abortion fight in
the House for years, said, ``I couldn't characterize it any other
way than as a defeat for the unborn. I was surprised, upset and
disappointed.''
   House members without strong positions ``felt they had the
Supreme Court to protect them'' until the July ruling, said Rep.
Dale Kildee, D-Mich. and a supporter of tougher restrictions.
   Now, however, ``it's no longer a vote cast in a vacuum. It's a
vote with real consequences,'' he said.
   The provision agreed to by the House would allow Medicaid
payments for abortions when the mother's life is in jeopardy or
when the pregnancy resulted from a rape or incest that was
``promptly'' reported to authorities. Since 1981 _ and as recently
as Aug. 2 _ the House has voted for language limiting federal aid
to abortions only in cases in which the woman's life was in danger.
   Just a year ago, the Senate caved to the restrictive House
position on Medicaid abortion financing by a vote of 47-43.
   The abortion provision is part of a $156.7 billion measure to
finance labor, health and education programs for fiscal 1990, which
began Oct. 1. The spending bill, which was approved 364-56, now
moves to the Senate.
   Bush threatened in August to veto the bill if it contains the
more liberal abortion language. Administration officials reiterated
that threat Wednesday.
   The president's senior advisers would recommend a veto if
Congress sent him a bill that would pay ``for abortions in cases
beyond when the life of the monther is endangered,'' said Alixe
Glen, a White House spokeswoman.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, answering a reporter's question
during a photo session, said, ``There is no retrenchment at all by
the president on this very important issue. ...''
   Just one disagreement remains to be settled between the two
chambers before the legislation goes to Bush _ whether to accept a
Senate proposal to ban federal aid to programs that buy hypodermic
needles for intravenous drug users unless the president certifies
that the effort helps prevent the spread of AIDS.
   The bill also contains more than $1.5 billion for AIDS research
and treatment; $4 billion for job-training programs; $1.9 billion
for alcohol, drug abuse and mental health programs; $11.7 billion
for welfare programs, and $2.1 billion for education for the
handicapped.
   The vote was the second abortion showdown in the House since the
Supreme Court's July 3 decision in the Webster vs. Reproductive
Health Services case.
   On Aug. 2, the chamber voted to dramatically liberalize abortion
restrictions in the District of Columbia. That was the first time
since 1980 that the chamber had rejected tighter limits.
   The August vote was considered less politically risky than
Wednesday's because it affected only residents of the nation's
capital, leaving unchanged federal laws that affect the whole
country.
   As have countless congressional debates on abortion, Wednesday's
fight was raged over the rights of the mother and the rights of the
fetus.
   ``Rape and incest is a tragedy. Nobody says it isn't,'' said
Hyde. ``But why visit on the second victim, the unborn child that
is the product of that criminal act, capital punishment?''
   Boxer countered, ``For the sake of human compassion, at least
allow the females of this nation to decide for themselves along
with their God'' whether they will undergo an abortion,
   At several points, the debate took a personal turn.
   ``I'm a psychiatrist and a physician who has treated victims of
both rape and incest,'' said Rep. James McDermott, D-Wash. ``I must
tell you the last thing victims of assault need is to have control
over their own bodies taken away from them yet again by the
government.''
   Rep. Jim Lightfoot, R-Iowa, spoke against liberalizing the
Medicaid constraints, saying he spoke for ``the children who
possibly were the result of an inconvenience, rape, incest, or
maybe a good time in the back seat of a Chevrolet. I happen to be
one of those. I have no idea why I was conceived or what happened.''
   In a letter sent to lawmakers and dated Tuesday, Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan said the Bush
administration opposes easing restrictions on Medicaid-financed
abortions ``for both philosophical and administrative reasons.''
Sullivan said it would be difficult to write regulations to
determine when rape or incest has occurred.
   Medicaid financing for poor women's abortions has been
restricted in one way or another since 1977.
   In 1979, the last year for which reliable figures are available,
there were 72 federally subsidized abortions in the United States,
according to the private Alan Guttmacher Institute.
   In fiscal 1987 _ the most recent statistics available _ the
federal government paid for 322 abortions at a cost of $160,000,
the institute says. States financed 189,000 abortions that same
year.
   There are an estimated 1.6 million abortions performed legally
in the United States each year.

   Communist leaders in East Germany have little
choice but to make reforms such as those occurring the Soviet
Union, two top West German officials said Wednesday.
   ``It's inconceivable that ... (East Germany) will stay as it
is'' in view of changes in the Soviet Union, Poland and Hungary,
West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told reporters.
   Stoltenberg, who met Tuesday with President Bush, and NATO
Secretary-General Manfred Woerner, a former West German defense
minister who visited Bush on Wednesday, spoke at separate news
conferences.
   ``The major disagreeable thing for them is that if they continue
like they do, their tough repression, they will not be able to
manage the change, they will not be able to peacefully develop
their countries,'' Woerner said about East Germany.
   ``They get more and more isolated, and I think that is reason
enough to change.''
   Stoltenberg said the repression used by China to crush its
student democracy movement wasn't ``a real alternative'' for East
Germany.
   ``But if they don't take the Chinese example, they have to move
in the other direction,'' he said. ``Otherwise, the economic and
political situation will deteriorate because people have no
motivation for work and have no motivation to participate under the
existing patterns.''
   Stoltenberg said earlier that Mikhail Gorbachev's attempts to
urge reforms on East Germany have been weakened because of his own
problems at home.
   ``Gorbachev's influence in the Warsaw Pact countries is not as
great as ... (the Soviet leader's) was five years ago because he
has more and more domestic difficulties,'' he said. ``He has
influence, but not, I think, to the same extent as ... his
predecessors had.''
   Gorbachev leader visited East Germany last week, expressing
confidence in Erich Honecker's ruling Communist Party. However,
Gorbachev urged Honecker's government to work with ``all forces in
society'' to tackle problems facing East Germany.
   Honecker indicated he would continue his hard-line approach and
not follow the reforms adopted in the Soviet Union, Poland and
Hungary.
   There have been mixed signals from the East German government
since Gorbachev's visit, with some calls for reform, as the country
grapples with how to staunch the flow of refugees to the West.
   More than 100,000 people have left East Germany this year, many
in recent weeks.
   ``We do not know what Gorbachev said to Honecker when he was
there, because they had a closed session, of course,'' Stoltenberg
said. ``But from some remarks some of his close officials made to
West German counterparts in private conversations, we think that he
advised them to do some reform steps.''
   Stoltenberg, who arrived here Monday, has met with Vice
President Dan Quayle, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary
of State James A. Baker III.
   He will visit U.S. and German forces at military bases in
Norfolk, Va., and Texas before returning to West Germany on Friday.

   The United Nations will send a highly
mobile border patrol force to Central America as part of the
regional peace agreement signed in August, says a report by
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   A copy of the report to the Security Council, obtained by The
Associated Press on Wednesday, shows the peacekeeping force will be
equipped with jeeps, helicopters and speedboats. The mission is to
involve 625 people, including civilian support personnel.
   Its job is to prevent any nation from mounting an attack on a
neighbor, to verify that no rebel forces cross borders to launch
raids and to halt radio or television TV broadcasts by
insurrectionists.
   The presidents of El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala
and Costa Rica requested the force in a letter to Perez de Cuellar
in March.
   Personnel from Canada, West Germany, Spain and a group of Latin
American nations are to join the operation.
   It must be approved by the Security Council, but council members
have indicated support for such a force, to be called ONUCA to
reflect the Spanish name for the United Nations.
   ONUCA will be the first major U.N. peacekeeping effort in the
Western Hemisphere. A two-man observer group was stationed in the
Dominican Republic in 1965-66 to monitor a truce between two
military factions vying for control of the government.
   The mission will include 260 military observers, 115 crew for 12
helicopters and an airplane, 50 men to operate speedboats and
patrol boats, a 14-member medical staff, 104 U.N. administrators
and 82 locally hired civilians.
   West Germany's contribution is not yet clear. Its constitution
prohibits sending soldiers abroad, except to support NATO, but it
could contribute members of the border police, pilots and support
personnel.
   Headquarters will be in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, with liaison
offices in the other four Central American capitals and 31
``verification centers'' staffed by observers.
   The naval unit, to be based at La Union, El Salvador, will
patrol the Gulf of Fonseca, coastal areas and rivers.
   No estimate of the operation's cost was given in the report.
   In a separate report released Wednesday, Perez de Cuellar said
another U.N. force would be needed to collect weapons from the
Contras, Nicaraguan rebels based in Honduras who are being
disbanded, and assist in their repatriation or relocation to
another country.
   U.N. election monitors also have gone to Nicaragua to verify
that national elections scheduled for Feb. 25 are conducted fairly
by the leftist Sandinista government.

   NEW YORK _ A committee of U.S. Roman Catholic bishops Wednesday
criticized alleged Israeli human rights abuses in the West Bank and
Gaza, and called for Palestinians to be included as equal partners
in negotiations for a sovereign Palestinian homeland.
   The draft statement by the Ad Hoc Committee on the Middle East
praised the United States for opening discussions with the
Palestine Liberation Organization, and asked the administration to
take a more active role in negotiating a peace in the Middle East
that meets the security needs of Israel and the ``long-denied
rights'' of Palestinians.
   ``It is our conviction that a truly open moment for peace exists
in the Middle East, and that the United States has an indispensable
role to play in the peace process which has moved us to write this
statement,'' said the committee, made up of Archbishop Roger Mahony
of Los Angeles, Cardinal John O'Connor of New York and Bishop
William Keeler of Baltimore.
   The statement, ``Toward Peace in the Middle East: Problems and
Principles,'' will be presented to the nation's 300 bishops at the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops' fall meeting Nov. 6-9 in
Baltimore.
   Some U.S. Jewish leaders welcomed the bishops' support for
Israel, but said they were troubled by parts of the statement,
including what they said was the bishops' premature support for a
sovereign Palestinian homeland.
   The bishops also failed to give equal weight ``to Israel's very
real problems and legitimate rights in maintaining order in the
territories,'' and a 40-year history of terrorist attacks by
Palestinians, said Rabbi A. James Rudin, national interreligious
affairs director of the American Jewish Committee, and Judith H.
Banki, his associate.
   An Arab leader applauded the bishops' draft document.
   ``The addition of such a respected moral voice on the side of
Palestinian independence is an historic development at a critial
juncture in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,'' said Abdeen Jabara,
president of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee.
``History will record that the moral authority of the American
Catholic Church was indisputably on the side of peace in the Middle
East.''
   The bishops said the statement was devised after consultations
with the Vatican, religious leaders in the Middle East, U.S.
policymakers on the region and major Jewish, Arab and Christian
organizations.
   All the groups the bishops met with were ``very, very grateful
for the role of the Catholic bishops,'' said Mahony, the committee
chairman who described the prelates' role as one of being
instruments of peace.
   ``We see this as a moral challenge. There is a better way to
live,'' he said.
   The intefadeh, the rebellion by Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza since 1987,
has recast the policy agenda in the Middle East by bringing
Palestinian claims to the forefront, the bishops said.
   The uprising is a ``cry for justice'' and ``personal and
political identity'' that demands ``on both moral and political
grounds, a response by the United States government,'' the bishops
wrote.
   The bishops cited several alleged Israeli human rights abuses in
the occupied territories, including beating deaths of Palestinians
and people not involved in demonstrations, the demolition of homes
and arrest and detention without trial.
   American support for Israel is basically a sound policy, the
bishops' committee said, but it does not conflict with concern for
human rights.
   The United States also must go beyond the approach taken in the
Camp David accords of the 1970s, which gave Palestinians a
secondary role in the peace process, and grant ``their right to
participate as equals, through representatives selected by
Palestinians, in all negotiations affecting their destiny,'' the
bishops said.
   Having opened political discussions with the PLO in December
1988, ``the United States now has the opportunity to use its
influence and relationships to foster a more extensive dialogue
among Israel, Palestinians and the Arab states,'' the bishops wrote.
   The bishops also called upon the Arab states and Palestinians to
recognize Israel's right to exist.
   ``The time is long since past when this basic element of
international life should be affirmed for Israel,'' the committee
said.
   The bishops specifically asked the Arab nations to establish
full diplomatic relations with Israel, and for all nations involved
in the peace process to pressure Syria to withdraw from Lebanon.
   One U.S. Jewish leader said the statement is worthy of
discussion, but its credibility is undermined by a failure to call
upon the Vatican to establish full diplomatic relations with Israel.
   ``It is incongruous of them to ask the Arab states to establish
such diplomatic relations while not asking the Vatican, the seat of
the Roman Catholic Church, to do so,'' said Elan Steinberg,
executive director of the World Jewish Congress.
   Mahony said the issue of Vatican relations with Israel was not
``in our jurisdiction or our competence.''

<HEAD>Fans, Music Critic at Odds Over Rock Drummer's Opera</HEAD>

   Fans generally were enthusiastic about the
world premiere of ``Holy Blood and Crescent Moon,'' an opera by
Stewart Copeland, former drummer of the rock group Police. But a
newspaper music critic panned it.
   ``Music is the heart and soul of opera, and Copeland's score
rises only at a few isolated moments to anything that makes us care
about his characters,'' Robert Finn of The (Cleveland) Plain Dealer
said in a review published Wednesday. ``It is full of nervous
orchestral busy-work.
   ``We are left here with a well-intentioned but essentially
amateurish work.''
   Finn added: ``Give the young pop composer credit for not making
some sort of pop-oriented opera out of his subject. He has tried
for something serious and genuine.''
   The curtain had to be held for 15 minutes Tuesday night while
hundreds of last-minute ticket buyers found their seats.
   David Bamberger, general manager of the Cleveland Opera, said
more tickets were sold for Copeland's opera than any other grand
opera the company has produced.
   For spectator Brent Brown, 22, of Painesville, the idea of a
rock star moving into the tradition-laden world of grand opera is
exciting. ``He's bringing new ideas to high opera,'' said Brown, in
dinner jacket and red bow tie.
   Copeland, who spent six years with the rock group Police and has
scored movies and television shows, took four years to write the
opera, a tale of the Crusades in the Middle East.
   Cleveland Opera officials said it is the first time a major
figure from popular music has written an opera since George
Gershwin wrote ``Porgy and Bess.''
   Copeland, 37, decided to write an opera on a lark in 1984, when
he wrote music for a ballet for Shakespeare's ``King Lear'' for the
San Francisco Ballet. He said he would write another ballet ``after
I finish my opera.''
   Bamberger's son, Stephen, heard the remark and urged his father
to contact Copeland.
   ``Holy Blood and Crescent Moon'' will be performed again
Thursday through Sunday at the State Theater and in March 1991 in
Fort Worth, Texas.
   Producers from several opera companies across the country were
invited to the Cleveland performances.

<HEAD>Cabinet Minister Says Nobel Committee Neglected Frenchman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The committee that awarded the Nobel Prize for
medicine to two American scientists should have recognized the
contributions made by a French researcher, France's minister for
research and technology said Wednesday.
   ``I share the deep regret of not having seen the name of
Professor (Dominique) Stehelin attached to the Nobel Prize for
medicine,'' Henri Curien told the National Assembly in response to
a lawmaker's question.
   Stehelin was the principal signer of the first article in the
scientific magazine Nature in 1976 on the discovery of the cellular
gene which is at the origin of cancer.
   The article was also signed by San Francisco scientists J.
Michael Bishop and Harold E. Varmus, who won this year's prize for
cancer research, and researcher Peter Vogt.
   ``The Nobel jury judged it fine to keep only the names of the
two California scientists,'' Curien said. ``I can assure you there
are some others, like Professor Peter Vogt, who are also very
disappointed.''
   Stehelin, a research director for the National Center for
Scientific Research at the Pasteur Institute in Lille, said Monday
that the decision to award the prize only to Bishop and Varmus was
``unfair and rotten.''
   Bishop and Varmus, who work together at the University of
California School of Medicine in San Francisco, have called
Stehelin's work crucial to the discovery of oncogenes, which
control normal growth cells and their division.
   The discovery showed cancer develops when the function of
oncogenes is disturbed and cells grow without control.

   The discovery of a key engine part from a
jumbo jet that crashed in July intensifies the search of Iowa
cornfields for other pieces to the puzzle of what caused the
DC-10's rear engine to fly apart, officials said Wednesday.
   ``We don't know yet whether this is the golden nugget we're
looking for,'' said Jim Burnett, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board. ``But we're glad we found it.''
   Officials of General Electric Co., which made the engine in
1972, said the discovery of the fan disk of the crippled DC-10 that
crashed July 19 while trying to land at the Sioux City airport is
important to the investigation into what happened to United Flight
232.
   ``This is the key to the whole search,'' said Jerry Clark, a
flight safety investigator for GE. Clark spoke at the Storm Lake
airport before the fan disk was flown to GE's Evendale jet engine
plant in suburban Cincinnati, where it arrived later in the day. GE
spokesman Rick Kennedy said federal inspectors went to the plant to
oversee inspection of the part.
   One hundred searchers hired by GE will walk newly harvested
fields in northwest Iowa this weekend.
   Flight 232 crashed while trying to land at the Sioux Gateway
Airport after its aft engine disintegrated in flight, throwing
parts that severed all the plane's hydraulic lines. The jumbo jet
cartwheeled across the runway in a fiery crash that killed 112
people; 184 people survived.
   Farmers have been recovering small pieces of the No. 2 engine
for several weeks, but investigators said the key to what happened
is apparently the 290-pound titanium disk that holds fan blades.
   But on Tuesday Janice Sorenson was running a combine through
corn a half-mile from her house on her farm about 10 miles north of
Alta. Alta is about 80 miles northwest of Des Moines.
   ``I felt a resistance against the combine, so I backed up, and I
looked and I could see the fan blades protruding from the ground,''
Mrs. Sorenson said.
   She said the disk ``was buried between 6 and 8 inches. It was
all in one piece but there were pieces of fan blades that had been
broken off.''
   What she had found was about two-thirds of the fan disk
assembly, which looks like a windmill.
   Burnett said it is too early to assume that a flaw in the disk
caused the crash. ``The metallurgical examination of the disk
itself, if in fact the problem originated there, should in fact
reveal the cause,'' Burnett said.
   ``Hopefully, it is something that will answer a lot of technical
questions and might do so in short order,'' he said.
   It is unlikely, he said, that the NTSB will reveal results of
tests before a hearing that begins Oct. 30 in Sioux City.
   In Evandale, Ohio, GE plant spokesman David Lane would not
theorize about what might have gone wrong with the disk, which
probably was made in the early 1970s, but said GE was eager to see
the part.
   ``This is a very significant find, in our eyes,'' he said.
   Mrs. Sorenson, 58, said she knew immediately what the piece was
because GE had distributed pictures to farmers.
   ``I was shocked and I was very happy for GE because they put a
lot of time in it,'' she said. ``Hopefully it will solve some of
the problems they've been looking for.''
   GE lawyer Stephen Gadd said Mrs. Sorenson will receive a portion
of the $50,000 reward it offered for the disk equal to the
percentage of the disk she recovered, plus separate rewards for
each fan blade. The company is paying up to $1,000 each for
recovered blades.
   Clark said he hopes the weekend search will yield results now
that fields no longer have 10-foot stands of corn.
   ``A lot of important parts are still missing and are out there
somewhere,'' he said, including 16 of 20 bolts that held the disk
to the engine.

<TEXT>
   A Colombian described by U.S. officials as a
major drug shipper was one of two suspects arrested Wednesday in
Colombia, the Justice Department said.
   Colombian police arrested Jose Rafael Abello Silva, 35, a member
of the Medellin cartel wanted on U.S. charges of conspiring to ship
500 kilograms of cocaine into this country, said Justice Department
spokeswoman Harri J. Kramer.
   A federal grand jury in Tulsa, Okla., indicted Abello in 1987 on
charges of conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine.
   ``He was considered a major transporter for the Medellin
cartel,'' said Cornelius Dougherty, a spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   Abello was responsible for ``major shipments of cocaine and
marijuana into the states,'' Dougherty said.
   The State Department was serving Colombian authorities with a
request that Abello and another suspect, Manuel Palma, to be held
under the provisional-detention section of President Virgilio
Barcos' extradition regulations, Kramer said.
   Palma is wanted by federal authorities in Miami on charges of
interstate travel in aid of racketeering in connection with an
operation to launder drug money, Kramer said.

<HEAD>Authorities Questioning Aliens About Dead Traveling Companions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VICTORIA, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Border Patrol is trying to
determine if a smuggler of illegal aliens locked four men in a
trailer on a railroad car where they were killed by a pesticide
used to fumigate the trailer, agents said Wednesday.
   Autopsies showed the four men found in the trailer and a fifth
found along the railroad tracks 60 miles away were killed by the
pesticide, officials said Wednesday.
   Border Patrol agents suspect the men were locked in the trailer
by smugglers in Harlingen, where the train left Monday night for
Houston.
   ``At this point, that appears to be the case, although we're not
ready to issue a complete report on that,'' said Border Patrol
Chief Silvestre Reyes of McAllen.
   ``We do believe that there was smuggler involved. We believe we
have a lead on a smuggler,'' he said.
   A smuggler may have arranged with someone to open the trailer
doors once the train stopped in Victoria, where at least one of the
men was destined, Reyes said.
   Four victims were found Tuesday in the truck trailer, being
hauled ``piggyback'' on a flatcar, on a rail siding in Victoria.
The fifth was spotted later near Sinton, a small town about 60
miles away where the train had stopped for nearly two hours
overnight.
   Preliminary autopsy reports from Travis County Medical Examiner
Robert Bayardo and Nueces County Medical Examiner Joseph Rupp
showed all five died of asphyxiation by hydrogen phosphate gas.
   The gas was emitted by Phostoxin pesticide packets tossed into
the trailer to kill boll weevils and other vermin in its cargo of
corn flour, or masa, during the rail trip.
   ``One of the guys had some coins in his pocket and those coins
were black, indicating there was poison in there,'' Victoria
Justice of the Peace Sylvia White said of one autopsy report.
   Complete toxicology reports could be issued later in the week,
she said.
   The trailer had two warning stickers the size of license plates
on its doors. They showed skulls and read in English and Spanish:
``Danger. This trailer is being fumigated'' and ``Do not enter.''
   One of the victims was from the state of Guerrero, Mexico, one
had documents from Honduras, and a third had papers that had been
stamped in El Salvador but indicated he was from Venezuela,
officials said. Authorities have found no identification for the
two others.
   Four other illegal aliens noticed the five were sluggish during
the stop in Sinton, police said.
   Victoria Police Lt. Jack Williams said the four, who rode the
same train, found one man on the ground at Sinton.
   ``But they thought he was intoxicated,'' Williams said. ``They
tried to wake him, but were unable to. So, they moved him off the
tracks. Then they went back to the truck where the man had been and
found the others passed out.''
   ``We don't know if he got off by himself or he had help,'' san
San Patricio County Sheriff's investigator Johnny Segovia.
   One of the four surviving aliens was treated at a Victoria
hospital after complaining of nausea, diarrhea and lightheadedness
believed to be related to inhaling the gas, police said.
   Phostoxin is one of three commonly used fumigants for grain
products, said Max Woodfin, agricultural resources protection
officer for the Texas Department of Agriculture.
   He said Phostoxin leaves no residue once the facility has been
properly ventilated for at least 24 hours after fumigation.

   East German Communist leaders reaffirmed their
commitment to doctrine, but expressed willingness Wednesday to
discuss reform in search of an ``attractive socialism'' to counter
growing discontent with the rigid regime.
   A statement from the ruling Politburo capped a day of
conflicting signals about whether the East Germans would maintain
the course of hard-line leader Erich Honecker or join the reform
spreading through Eastern Europe.
   In addressing the flight of tens of thousands of East Germans,
the statement said: ``We aren't indifferent when people who worked
and lived here renounce our German Democratic Republic. The reasons
for the step could be varied. We must and will seek out them among
ourselves, each in his place, all of us together.
   ``Together we want to discuss all of the basic questions of our
society which must be solved today and tomorrow,'' and suggestions
``for a strategic conception of continuity and change'' will be
made at a Central Committee meeting scheduled for late November or
early December, the Politburo declared.
   ``All expressions of opinion and suggestions for attractive
socialism ... are important,'' said the statement, distributed by
the official news agency ADN. ``We are open to discussions.''
   It did not mention the growing opposition movement, but urged
East Germans to refrain from the kind of street demonstrations that
swept the country last week and on Monday night.
   Earlier Wednesday, party sources said high-ranking Communist
officials had warned of possible labor unrest and demanded a report
from Honecker, 77, on the nation's ``critical situation.'' Kurt
Hager, the party ideologist, reversed himself and called for reform
to curb the growing unrest.
   The demand for a report, made in the Politburo meeting Tuesday,
suggests Honecker may face an internal challenge to his 18-year
leadership. The sources disclosed it soon after the radio broadcast
Hager's remarks.
   Party sources quoted the complaining officials as telling
Honecker ``there are increasing signs of coming strikes in the
factories'' and ``there is no time to waste.''
   Honecker was told some workers already were refusing to work
overtime and called on the government to address the ``increasingly
pressing questions'' of the the nation's people, the sources
reported. He was asked to report by the end of the week, they said.
   Politburo member Egon Krenz was responsible for the restraint
shown by security forces to show restraint during Monday's
pro-democracy demonstrations in Leipzig, East Berlin and Dresden,
the sources said. Krenz often is mentioned as a successor to
Honecker.
   Late Wednesday, ADN said Honecker had postponed a visit to
Denmark scheduled for Oct. 25-26. No reason was given.
   Hager, one of the hierarchy's most influential figures,
recommended a greater role for the people in solving national
problems, a more open society and reform of the state-controlled
news media. He did not suggest specific actions.
   The ideologist, also 77, made the recommendations in an
interview Saturday with the Soviet weekly newspaper Moscow News
while street protests were under way and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev was visiting East Germany.
   State radio read his comments Wednesday. Earlier in the day, the
party newspaper Neues Deutschland vigorously defended the country's
communist system.
   ``Our task in the immediate future is to come up with a clear
concept for the development of necessary changes,'' said Hager, who
has been known as a hard-liner opposed to the Gorbachev-style
reforms in Eastern Europe.
   ``That will require, above all, the active involvement of the
people in solving important problems and a new policy of public
information. A freer and broader discussion is developing in the
press.''
   Virtually all news media are under strict official control.
   Referring to the mass exodus, mostly of skilled young people,
Hager said: ``All of the obstacles have to be cleared away that
have apparently prevented our youth from developing their full
potential.''
   He said the government should respond to the ``needs and mood''
of the people.
   During his two-day visit last week for East Germany's 40th
anniversary, Gorbachev urged Honecker to make democratic reforms.
   In Bonn, chief government spokesman Hans Klein repeated West
Germany's offer of ``wide-ranging help'' if East Germany implements
reforms.
   Guenter Krusche, head of the Lutheran Church in East Berlin,
told Deutschlandfunk radio in Cologne, West Germany, he was
``optimistic that a dialogue will soon start between the nation's
leadership and the opposition movement.''
   Party officials in Dresden, Leipzig and Magdeburg have either
started talks with pro-democracy activists or plan them, West
German news reports say.

   The owners of a ship wrecked off
Scotland in 1941 with 20,300 cases of Scotch whisky on board said
Wednesday they plan to salvage what's left of the cargo.
   Despite the efforts of police and customs officers, most of the
cargo was looted by the Hebridean islanders of Eriskay and the
neighboring islands of South Uist and Barra when the Politician was
wrecked on rocks off Eriskay.
   The ship made Eriskay famous and brought it a tourist trade that
continues to this day.
   Salvagers believe the wreck, buried in sand in 20-foot waters
off Eriskay's north coast, still contains 2,000 to 4,000 cases of
whisky and possibly eight metal cases of Jamaican currency, said
spokesman Frank Gilfeather.
   The owners of the salvage rights include several financiers, a
diver and a lawyer, he said.
   The group plans to offer shares to the public to raise a minimum
of $800,000 needed to recover the sunken cargo, Gilfeather said.
The operation is expected to take place in the spring, he said.
   ``I don't think anybody would take the chance of drinking'' the
whisky, Gilfeather said. ``It would be a collector's item.''
   The booze was so plentiful on Eriskay in the 1940s that women
were seen pouring it on peat fires to make them burn more easily.
   The wreck gave novelist Compton Mackenzie the plot for his comic
novel, ``Whiskey Galore.'' It was made into a film of the same name
in 1948, but renamed ``Tight Little Island'' for release in the
United States.

   The Florida Legislature adjourned its
special session Wednesday after refusing to pass any of the
restrictions on abortions that Gov. Bob Martinez demanded.
   Adjournment came just one day after lawmakers convened the
special session that Martinez called after the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that states could impose limits.
   The session had attracted thousands of demonstrators on both
sides of the issue.
   ``A right, having been established, is not easily removed,''
House Speaker Tom Gustafson said. ``Once the right to choice was
established and clearly understood ... the right to privacy
established and clearly understood, people do not willingly give up
those freedoms.''
   Lawmakers in the House and Senate shot down proposals that would
have curbed abortion in many ways, including cutting public
financing and toughening clinic regulations.
   The session, first in the nation after the Supreme Court ruling,
had been viewed as a bellwether. More than 10,000 demonstrators
descended upon the quiet Southern capital to wage the first pitched
battle since the July decision that upheld Missouri abortion limits.
   The governor's original goals included banning public financing
for abortions, requiring viability tests on the fetuses of women at
least 20 weeks pregnant and requiring physicians to tell women
seeking abortions about the development of their fetuses.
   Martinez conceded his initiative had faltered badly.
   ``I don't think it's a moment for rejoicing,'' the first-term
Republican governor said. ``If anything, it's a moment of sadness.''
   The governor criticized lawmakers for failing to bring any of
his proposals up for a full floor vote.
   ``You can't make a determination by a handful of people in a
committee on an issue this vital,'' he said. ``I think that the
will of the people would have been better served if all the people
would have been represented.''
   But national leaders of the pro-choice movement seized the
opportunity to call the failed session a sign of a turning tide.
   ``Florida has just sent a message to the nation,'' said Eleanor
Smeal, president of the Fund for a Feminist Majority and a former
president of the National Organization for Women. ``Political
leaders are getting a public-opinion message that they cannot,
should not, restrict or interfere with women's rights any longer.
And people don't want any more restrictions on abortion.''
   Patricia Ireland, national vice president of NOW, was jubilant.
   ``What we're seeing this session is a shift by women's rights
supporters from the defensive to the offensive,'' she said at a
news conference. ``This is one of those junctures where the
political climate has clearly changed. This is creating a new wave
of feminism that we have not had since the 1960s.''
   Ken Connor, president of Florida Right To Life, said the fight
is not over.
   ``What's next is we go back to work. We field new candidates who
affirm the sanctity and dignity of human life,'' he said. ``We
explore the potential for a constitutional amendment.''
   The governor had held out hope that tougher standards for
clinics _ among the least controversial of the bills _ would pass.
But a Senate committee killed three bills on clinic regulation
Wednesday, after five other bills died in Senate committee. In the
House, six bills met a similar fate in subcommittee Wednesday.
   A Senate committee also killed a measure to put abortion
restrictions before voters in the form of a constitutional
amendment. That amendment would have allowed counties to raise
property taxes to pay for the care of poor, pregnant women and
their babies, and would have restricted abortions to cases
involving rape, incest, the health of the mother and deformed
fetuses.
   Lawmakers had predicted the session would accomplish little
after a Florida Supreme Court ruling last week that the state's
privacy amendment protects a woman's right to an abortion.
   The justices knocked down a 1988 parental-consent law for
Florida minors seeking abortions, and also ruled the state
Constitution protects women's abortion rights in the first
trimester.
   The governor's rout in the abortion session was reminiscent of a
similar drubbing he took in efforts to pass a tax on services. His
popularity took a beating and he later pushed successfully to
repeal the law. He faces re-election in 1990.
   Senate President Bob Crawford refused to speculate on the
political damage to Martinez, who faces re-election in 1990.
   ``There's probably lessons for everybody here,'' he said.
   House Speaker Gustafson said Florida's experience should not be
considered a crystal ball for the rest of the nation.
   ``I think every state is different,'' he said.

<HEAD>Romanian Baptists Sentenced for Building Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Romanians have been sentenced in that
communist country for their parts in building a Baptist Church
without government permission, Keston College reported Wednesday.
   The London-based research institute, which monitors religious
freedom in communist nations, said the four Baptists were sentenced
to ``corrective labor sentences'' Oct. 5 in Gheorghe Gheorgiu-dej.
   It said the men were required to pay part of their earnings to
the government and live under house arrest.
   Nicolae Iacob was sentenced to two years, eight months for his
role in building the Comanesti Baptist Church, Valentin Rusu to two
years, six months and Mihai Cretu and Gheorghe Iacobuta to one
year, the college said.
   One sentence was believed to have been suspended, Keston College
said, but added that it did not know which one or how much was to
be deducted from the men's wages.
   There are 200,000 Baptists in Romania, a nation of 23 million.
   Romanian authorities say the church, demolished May 31, was
built without proper authorization, but Keston College said the men
were charged with using stolen building materials.
   ``The sentences handed down on two of the Baptists ... appear to
exceed the provisions specified in Romanian law,'' it said in a
statement.
   ``Under the April 1973 amendments to the penal code ... the
maximum sentence of compulsory labor that can be imposed is two
years. Between 15 and 50 percent of a person's wages may be
deducted.''
   Keston College reported three other men ``who had apparently
transported the building materials'' were being tried, but ``there
is no information yet as to what sentences they received.''

<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee voted 21-0 Wednesday
evening to approve a clean air bill designed to substantially
reduce urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals by the
end of the century.
   The House Energy and Commerce environment subcommittee used
President Bush's clean air proposal as a first draft. The bill that
emerged from the panel included substantially tougher auto tailpipe
emissions standards, putting the California requirements into
effect for the entire country.
   Just before the final vote, the subcommittee substantially eased
Bush's proposal to require clean-burning auto fuels in smoggy
cities and force automakers to build cars able to burn those fuels.
   The sponsors of Bush's proposal led the charge to change the
bill, which was done by a 12-10 vote after top administration
officials gave conflicting positions in simultaneous phone calls to
subcommittee members. The auto and petroleum industries had backed
the change.
   It was the first time the subcommittee had approved an overhaul
of clean air legislation since 1977, though a review was due in
1981. Previous attempts were defeated in subcommittee or never
reached a vote.
   The bill can next go either to a second Energy and Commerce
subcommittee or the full Energy and Commerce Committee. The energy
and power subcommittee has not decided whether it wants a chance to
examine the acid rain provisions of the bill, which require major
reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides by
coal-burning utilities in the East.
   The vote on clean-fueled cars would eliminate a requirement that
automakers build a million cars annually from 1997 through 2004 to
run on gasoline substitutes, to be sold in the nation's smoggiest
cities.
   The new version would allow the Environmental Protection Agency
to order the cars built, but only after taking into account
potential consumer acceptance, technological feasibility, health,
safety, air quality improvement, fuel availability, capability of
production and other factors.
   It also would define clean fuels in a way that environmentalists
said would bring little pollution reduction. Clean fuels would be
anything that achieved the same pollution reductions from ordinary
gasoline as is achieved by a mixture of 85 percent methanol and 15
percent gasoline.
   The vote turned previous debates on Bush's bill upside own, with
chief sponsors Norman Lent, R-N.Y. and John D. Dingell, D-Mich.
urging the change _ and winning support from most subcommittee
Republicans who have general backed Bush.
   Subcommittee Chairman Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., who has been
largely critical of the Bush plan, strongly defended the
president's proposal for clean-fueled cars and accused Lent of
``trashing the administration proposal you introduced.''
   Even more bizarre were separate and conflicting phone calls,
made about 1 p.m. by EPA Administrator William Reilly from Chicago
and Bush Chief of Staff John Sununu from the White House.
   Waxman said Reilly told him to oppose the amendment, sponsored
by Reps. Ralph Hall, D-Texas and Jack Fields, R-Texas. Lent said
Sununu informed him the administration was neutral on the amendment.
   ``Sununu called my office and assured me that President Bush
does not oppose this amendment,'' Lent said. ``He sent a member of
the White House staff (to the committee room) to say the president
does not oppose ... the administration does not support'' the
amendment.
   Waxman replied, ``I talked to Reilly this afternoon and he
informed me the administration is against Hall-Fields. ... I asked
him if I could represent that as the administration position and he
said `yes.'''
   Waxman continued, ``I don't know where the administration is and
it may be all over the lot ... on both sides. It tells a lot about
how they're handling the bill.''
   Later, Waxman said, ``The winners are going to be the oil
industry and the auto industry.'' He added there would be future
fights on the same issue in the full committee and on the floor.
   After Bush's bill was introduced, the White House called the
clean fuels proposal ``perhaps the most innovative and far-reaching
component'' of the proposals to reduce ozone, a major component of
the haze that hangs over most American cities.
   Ron Sykes, a lobbyist for General Motors Corp., said the
carmakers didn't like Bush's language to force them to build
clean-fueled cars because there was no guarantee consumers would
buy them.
   The Bush legislation did not specify use of any particular fuel,
but the oil industry contended it would have given strong authority
to the EPA to choose one.
   Oil companies said EPA favored methanol, an alcohol used by some
racing cars. As a pure fuel, it produces much less ozone than
gasoline, but mixed with gasoline, as in the 85-15 ratio spelled
out in the bill, pollution reductions are less.
   Its major pollution is formaldehyde, a cancer-causing chemical
little studied in the atmosphere.
   The oil industry and lawmakers from districts where other
alternative fuels like natural gas and propane are produced argued
that every clean-burning fuel should have an equal chance to power
America's future cars, and contended the Hall-Fields amendment
would do so.

   The National Organization for Women and
other groups, buoyed by the Legislature's refusal to toughen
Florida's abortion laws, hope a new women's-rights wave will propel
pro-choice candidates into state and national offices, activists
said Wednesday.
   ``This is creating a new wave of feminism that we have not had
since the 1960s,'' said Patricia Ireland, NOW's national vice
president. ``We're seeing the impact of this session all over the
country.''
   The pro-choice forces were shocked by the U.S. Supreme Court
decision allowing states to restrict abortions, and this
legislative session became a rallying point for action, the
activists said.
   Ireland said NOW and other groups would target anti-abortion
candidates for Congress, governorships and statehouses for defeat
in 1990.
   ``What we're seeing this session is a shift by women's rights
supporters from the defensive to the offensive,'' she said. ``This
is one of those junctures where the political climate has clearly
changed.''
   Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way Action
Fund, a liberal political action group, said politicians across the
country should take note of what happened in Florida.
   ``Today's victory will be a rude wake-up call for politicians
hoping to score points at the polls by rolling back reproductive
freedom,'' Kropp said. ``Legislators in other states should take
heed: pro-choice politics is winning politics, even in conservative
states.''
   In Florida, NOW state President Jane Blimling said the
organization hopes to elect eight more women in the House and five
in the Senate. At present, there are 16 women in the House and 10
in the upper chamber. The House has 120 members; the Senate 40.
   She said the organization's 36 Florida chapters are gathering
information on anti-abortion legislators and would use their
stances in the next round of elections.
   Gov. Bob Martinez, a Republican who called the special
legislative session, has seriously harmed himself among pro-choice
women voters who won't forget, said Eleanor Smeal, president of the
Fund for the Feminist Majority. Martinez is up for election to a
second term next year.
   The two Democratic candidates for governor, state Sen. George
Stuart of Orlando and U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson of Melbourne, have both
criticized Martinez for calling the session. On the Republican
side, state Sen. Marlene Woodson-Howard of Bradenton just announced
her intention to oppose the governor in a GOP primary. She, too,
cited his anti-abortion stance.
   Congressional seats will be reapportioned following the 1990
Census, and Florida could pick up as many as four seats in the
House. Smeal and Ireland said much of their groups' resources would
be concentrated on races in Florida.
   All three women said the special session, called soon after the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled in July that states could further restrict
abortion laws, had galvanized women _ especially younger women _
into political action.
   NOW organized a ``caravan for choice'' to 17 Florida cities,
where they lobbied people and organized them to work against making
state abortion laws more restrictive. Groups on the other side also
organized their forces.

   Senate leaders made a last-ditch search
Wednesday night for a way to consider President Bush's cut in
capital-gains taxes without slowing work on a major
deficit-reduction bill.
   In the House, which already has passed a deficit bill that
includes a capital-gains cut, leaders bowed out of the hunt. ``We
basically have done our work,'' Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif.,
chairman of the House Budget Committee, told reporters. ``Now the
Senate has to do its work.''
   ``The Senate has to work out its own problems,'' added Rep. Bill
Archer of Texas, senior Republican on the House Ways and Means
Committee.
   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, planned one
last meeting on the issue with senior colleagues, even as the
Senate prepared to deliberate the deficit bill.
   ``Hope springs eternal,'' Mitchell said, while assailing the
Bush administration's insistence on the capital-gains reduction.
   A series of closed-door leadership meetings in the House and
Senate has been aimed at stripping all non-deficit issues from the
deficit-reduction bill. Presumably, the big extraneous issues,
including capital gains and the Democrats' proposal to expand
tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts, would be added to a
new bill and considered later this year.
   Barring a major suprise, the Senate will begin work Thursday on
the bill, a package of spending reductions and tax increases that
would cut the deficit by about $14 billion this budget year. That
bill does not include a capital-gains reduction, although
supporters may try to have one added during the debate.
   Whether to reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profits
from the sale of investments, has dominated development of the
deficit-reduction bill.
   Bush wants a cut, contending it would spur the economy and, at
least in the short run, generate additional revenues for deficit
reduction.
   Most Democrats oppose the reduction because 80 percent of the
tax saving would go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
They say the cut would deepen the deficit by $67 billion over the
next 10 years.
   Under Senate rules, it would require 60 votes _ rather than the
usual majority of 51 _ to add a capital-gains cut to the deficit
bill.
   Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said Thursday night: ``We think we have the
votes to win on this,'' presumably meaning 51. ``Why not have a
vote?'' he asked in an interview on the MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour on
PBS.
   ``A majority has expressed support for some form of
capital-gains or another,'' Mitchell said on the same program,
``but no majority has agreed to any particular plan ... No plan may
possibly get a majority.''
   Mitchell accused the administration of demanding special
treatment under Senate rules so that a bare majority would be able
to approve a capital-gains cut. He recalled that the minority
Republicans used the same rule to their benefit earlier this year
and prevailed over Democrats on a bill bailing out the savings and
loan industry.
   ``The same rules apply to everyone equally,'' Mitchell said.
``It is the height of hypocrisy, the height of unfairness to say
they should benefit from the rules when they are advantaged'' and
that Democrats should not when the tables are turned.

   President F.W. de Klerk told
militant anti-apartheid leaders Wednesday he was ready to negotiate
on black voting rights, but they demanded more concessions before
serious talks begin.
   The three-hour meeting with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
two other church leaders came a day after de Klerk announced his
decision to free eight longtime security prisoners, including seven
leaders of the outlawed African National Congress.
   In Washington, the State Department welcomed the plans for
release and urged ``the release of all political prisoners,
including Nelson Mandela,'' the nation's most famous prisoner.
   ``I hope today's meeting will be looked on as a milestone on the
positive road ahead,'' de Klerk said after the talks.
   But Tutu, the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, and the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary
of the South African Council of Churches, said de Klerk declined to
give clear-cut responses to their demands.
   ``We made it clear we need results,'' Chikane said. ``Without
results, we can't have negotiations.''
   The clergymen demanded the lifting of the state of emergency,
legalization of the African National Congress and other banned
groups, the release of all detainees and political prisoners, the
lifting of restrictions on political activity, and clemency for
prisoners on Death Row.
   ``If these things happen, we'll say to our people: give them
(the government) a chance. They are serious,'' Tutu said.
   However, the clergymen said they would press on with calls for
tougher economic sanctions against South Africa unless de Klerk
complied with their demands.
   De Klerk, who became president in August, said the clergymen
were reluctant to trust his pledges to negotiate a new, just
political system.
   ``We are really no longer arguing about the fact that all South
Africans must have a vote, that all South Africans must become
involved in all decisions affecting their life,'' he said. ``What
we must now start talking about is how do we structure that.''
   De Klerk opposes a one-man, one-vote system and black majority
rule. He has not specified what role he envisions for blacks in the
national government.
   The president said his government planned to consult with a wide
range of South African leaders as part of a step-by-step process to
negotiate a new constitution.
   He declined to say when the eight prisoners would be released,
but other government officials said it could be within days.
   De Klerk said Mandela's status was not discussed at Wednesday's
meeting, but the 71-year-old leader is widely expected to be
released within the next few months.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the U.S.
government hoped the planned prisoner releases ``are merely the
first steps in a process which will see the release of all
political prisoners, including Nelson Mandela, and the return of
political exiles, lifting of the state of emergency and associated
restrictions on political activity, and negotiations on a peaceful
transition to a nonracial and democratic South Africa.''
   Walter Sisulu, the most prominent of the eight prisoners, is a
close friend of Mandela and was a major African National Congress
leader before the organization was banned in 1960.
   Oscar Mpetha, who at 80 is the oldest political prisoner in the
country, is also among the eight. He was seen Wednesday at Groote
Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, where he has spent most of his
five-year prison term.
   Police used tear gas and batons to stop black youths from
entering a sports stadium in the mixed-race township of Athlone,
near Cape Town, where about 3,000 had gathered to celebrate
Mpetha's expected release. Police blocked the crowd from marching
out of the stadium, and the youths sang freedom songs before
dispersing quietly when they were told Mpetha had not yet been
freed.
   The Prisons Service declined to give details about where, when
and how each prisoner would be released.
   In addition to Sisulu, those to be released include four other
men sentenced to life in prison with Mandela in 1964 in connection
with a guerrilla sabotage campaign to overthrow the white
government.
   They are Ahmed Kathrada, 60; Andrew Mlangeni, 63; Elias
Motsoaledi, 65; and Raymond Mhlaba, 69, all identified at their
trial as members of the high command of the African National
Congress military wing, Spear of the Nation.
   Others to be freed are Mpetha; Wilton Mkwayi, 66, who briefly
took command of the military wing after the arrest of Mandela's
colleagues; and Jafta Masemula, a member of the outlawed Pan
Africanist Congress guerrilla organization who was sentenced to
life in 1963 for sabotage.

<HEAD>Experts Predict Trade Deficit Will Remain</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trade negotiations will not substantially cut
the multibillion dollar U.S. trade deficit with Japan and it might
go higher in the near future, economists told a congressional
hearing Wednesday.
   The Joint Economic Committee also was also told that Japanese
consumers' tolerance for high prices will remain an invisible trade
barrier, and that the two countries disagree on the meaning of
``open markets.''
   A former U.S. trade negotiator, Clyde Prestowitz, pressed for
the United States to develop a national industrial policy under
which it would negotiate for results more specific than what he
called the unworkable and unrealistic targets of open markets and
free trade.
   Prestowitz is the author of ``Trading Places: How we Allowed
Japan to Take the Lead,'' a book about the two countries' economic
rivalry.
   Trade is already managed in some areas, and America's trade
partners have industrial policies, he said, ``so I would like to
see it managed intelligently.'' Prestowitz cited as examples of
managed trade, semiconductors, automobiles, machine tools, steel,
textiles, air transport and fishing.
   Current market-opening policies aggravate tension by spawning
accusations of unfairness, Prestowitz said, maintaining that
Japanese do not clearly understand what Americans mean by ``open
markets'' and American exporters do not grasp Japanese urgings for
them to ``try harder.''
   Robert Z. Lawrence, senior economist at the Brookings
Institution, a private policy research organization, urged against
what he called a ``quick fix'' to the trade imbalance by
negotiating for ``results rather than rules.''
   ``In fact, the evidence suggests that the twin policies of a
strong yen and detailed negotiations,'' product by product, are
working, if slowly, to increase imports by Japan, he said.
   Managed trade, he said, would greatly increase Japanese
government influence over the private sector and the result would
be to subject America's most competitive high technology industries
to ``intense competition'' from targeted exports.
   Lawrence acknowledged, however, that the U.S. dollar's regained
strength against then Japanese yen points to little or no
improvement in the U.S. trade deficit with Japan in the next year
or two. ``It could well get worse,'' he said _ but if measured in
Japanese yen, instead of dollars, the U.S. deficit shows decline.
   The imbalance ``will be relatively unaffected'' by trade
developments, said Raymond J. Ahearn, trade specialist of the
Congressional Research Service.
   The deficit with Japan, $52 billion last year, ``will tend to
get worse,'' Prestowitz said. ``It's going to be hard to have a
trade surplus so long as we have low savings'' in the United
States, he added.

<HEAD>Racially Inflamed Fights Break Out at Alabama, Arkansas Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   One student was stabbed and six others arrested in a racially
inflamed melee at an Alabama high school, and at least 300 students
at Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., were involved in
similar fistfights Wednesday, authorities and witnesses said.
   Students were sent home at Minor High School near Adamsville,
Ala., after days of racial tension sparked violence that began in
the school cafeteria.
   Principal Judson Jones had called students to the cafeteria to
discuss friction among black and white students, when a shove
escalated into a Mace-spraying, gunshots-firing melee, witnesses
said.
   ``While we were in the lunchroom, two white guys came into the
lunchroom, stood up on some tables and began spraying Mace in the
faces of (black) students,'' said 15-year-old student Kimberly
Nixon. ``Then fights broke out all over the school, inside and
outside the building.''
   A teacher, who was not identified, fired gunshots into the air
in an attempt to break up fighting, and a 17-year-old senior,
Johnny Drummonds, was treated for a shoulder stab wound and
released from Lloyd Noland Hospital. The principal received minor
cuts when he tried to intervene.
   ``There was mass confusion, running and screaming everywhere,''
said police Sgt. Ronald Benson. Thirty patrol cars were called to
the school, where classes were expected to resume Thursday under
tight security.
   The gun-toting teacher will be disciplined, said Nez Calhoun,
spokeswoman for the Jefferson County school board.
   At least 60 students, half blacks and half whites, were
involved. About 25 percent of the school's 967 students are black.
   Police said tension at the school was due partly to black gang
activity and what black students perceive as taunting by white
students.
   Miss Nixon said black students were angered during homecoming
festivities last week when a white student came to school with
black paint on his hands and face and an afro wig on his head.
   A pep rally Friday at Minor High was marred by yelling and
pushing between black and white students.
   The six students arrested, one 18-year-old and five juveniles,
had not yet been processed at the Jefferson County Sheriff's
Department and specific charges against them were not immediately
available, said Lt. Earl Patterson.
   In Little Rock, at least a half-dozen fistfights broke out after
a burning effigy of a red devil, mascot of a rival school, fell
from a tree across from Central High onto the car of a black
student during an outdoor, homecoming pep rally, Principal Everett
Hawks said.
   Fighting spread quickly, spilling into school hallways.
   In 1957, President Eisenhower sent federal troops to protect
nine black students who integrated Central High in a mob-violence
atmosphere.
   ``It started out by being a ruckus, like 1957, except the blacks
were the majority and the whites were the minority. Simple as that,
and I'm black,'' senior class president Jay Brown said.
   The 16-year-old owner of the car said he instigated a fight
after friends pointed out a white student as the person responsible
for damage to the auto. Hawks said a white student is believed
responsible, but not the one attacked by the student and his
friends.
   A hubcap and side panel near a tire on the car were singed by
flames.
   ``It became a real significant racial issue. That's scary for us
and tragic,'' Hawks said.
   Central High has 1,813 students, 58 percent of whom are black.
   No charges were expected and no weapons were involved, city
police Officer Jason Shook said.

<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old boy found his mother choking on
a cough drop and calmly called 911, asked for help and directed
firefighters to the condominium where they saved the woman.
   ``I think he went above and beyond the call of duty,'' said
Capt. John Biggs, one of three firefighters who responded to the
call.
   Jameson Rodgers, who turns 4 on Thursday, found his mother,
Peggy, 32, doubled up on the living room floor Tuesday.
   Trained since age 2 to dial 911 in case of emergency, Jameson
went to a telephone placed low on the wall just for him and called
for help.
   An excerpt of the emergency call reveals the boys calm under
pressure.
   Jameson: ``Hi.''
   Dispatcher: ``Can I help you?''
   Jameson: ``My mommy's not breathing.''
   Dispatcher: ``Can your mommy come to the phone?''
   Jameson: ``My mommy can't talk now ... my mommy's choking.''
   A firefighter was able to dislodge the cough drop from the
woman's throat, and after a few minutes she was breathing normally.
   Although Jameson wasn't able to give the emergency dispatcher
his address, the call was automatically traced and rescuers arrived
quickly, Biggs said.
   The boy apologized to firefighters about his forgetfulness.
   ``I really did know my address,'' he said.
   Jameson, the grandson of 1950s and 1960s pop singer Jimmie
Rodgers learned to dial 911 on the special phone during his
mother's second pregnancy in case she went into labor while his
father, Michael, 26, wasn't home.
   The boy's grandfather recorded such hits such as ``Honeycomb''
and ``Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.''

<HEAD>IAPA President Says Press Freedoms Improving</HEAD>

   The hemisphere is showing a ``healthy
tendency toward freedom of expression,'' Manuel Jimenez, president
of the Inter-American Press Association said Wednesday.
   ``This year has been very significant in the history of freedom
of the press and expression in America,'' Jimenez said in his final
report to IAPA members at their 45th general assembly.
   Paraguay, whose dictatorship under Gen. Alfredo Stroessner ended
in a coup by Gen. Andres Rodriguez earlier this year, ``is on the
road to re-establishing, after many, many years, a real democracy
and also creating a climate of freedom of the press and
expression,'' Jimenez said.
   The two leading candidates for president of Chile, Hernan Buchi
and Patricio Aylwin, have been recognized by IAPA for their
struggle to re-establish press freedoms after 16 years of military
rule by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, he said.
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's announcment that
the government would sell its newsprint monopoly was received with
``great surprise and satisfaction,'' he said.
   ``There's no doubt that all the above represents extraordinary
news and that there exists in the continent a healty tendency
toward freedom of expression,'' Jimenez said.
   ``But as there have been exceptionally good things, the Republic
of Panama remains a dark and nebulous point,'' he added.
   ``There, the government of Gen. Manuel Noreiga recently
terminated the only vestige of freedom of expression and has seized
the last independent television channel,'' said Jimenez, of the
daily newspaper La Nacion in Costa Rica.
   The result of the Feb. 25 national elections in Nicaragua will
determine whether press freedoms are reinstated in that country, he
said.
   Regarding the Nicaraguan elections, IAPA members held a lengthy
debate over holding the organization's planned midyear meeting in
Managua in March.
   Although they decided to maintain the site, several members said
the organization should not become involved in the ``massive
fraud'' expected by the Sandinista government.
   ``All the signs show that the elections are going to be a
fraud,'' said German Ornes, former IAPA president and editor of the
daily El Caribe newspaper of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
   ``We are talking about a possible loss of money against people
who have lost their freedom and their lives,'' said Jim Hampton,
editor of the Miami Herald. ``I would be astonished if there
weren't fraud.''
   Violeta Chamorro, owner of the daily Nicaraguan opposition
newspaper La Prensa, has vowed to restore press freedoms if she
wins the elections.
   ``It's a statement of our principles and belief in free
expression. If a miracle occurs and Violeta wins, it would be a
hell of a celebration,'' Hampton said in an interview after the
debate.
   ``But if the expected occurs and the election is stolen than
it's an occassion for us to point out what happens, to deplore it
and let the Sandinistas know that we've got our eye on them,''
Hampton said.
   Not going to Managua would be ``handing the Sandinista
government a real victory'' and would demonstrate that ``somehow
we're afraid to go,'' said Michael McQuire, Chicago Tribune deputy
managing editor for national and international news.
   ``We would be denying ourselves an opportunity of fulfilling one
of our most noble purposes ... and demonstrating solidarity with
our collegues who are being suppressed and suffering indignities,''
McQuire said.
   In another IAPA matter, the organization's general assembly
recommended that member newspapers publish a 400-word editorial
regarding Tuesday's killings of Colombian journalists and the
attack on the life of a Salvadoran journalist and the death of his
wife.
   ``The climate of terror imposed by the drug cartels on the free
Colombian press has no comparison in the history of the
continent,'' said the editorial, written by Augusto Nunez of the
daily newspaper O Estado of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
   ``Dictatorships and authoritarian regimes that for many decades
have punished the American nations always have included independent
journalists among their favorite targets,'' he wrote.
   ``But those governments never have tried to institutionalize the
systematic extermination of those journalists that defend laws and
institutions,'' Nunez wrote.

<TEXT>
   A retired Harvard Medical School professor and
a Nigerian health researcher have been chosen winners of the first
Drew World Medical Prizes, officials at Howard University Hospital
announced Wednesday.
   The American recipient was Harold Amos, Ph.D., who had served as
chairman of the department of microbiology and molecular genetics
as well as head of the division of medical sciences at Harvard.
   Amos' general field of study involved animal cells in culture,
originating from his basic research in herpes simplex virus, which
utilized mice and eggs for growth.
   Also named to receive the Drew award was Benjamin Otuwakayode
Osuntokun, M.D., Ph.D., of Ibadan, Nigeria, who has undertaken
path-breaking medical research in Nigeria and served as provost of
the Worl Health Organization.
   Osuntokun's work has focused on diagnosing and treating a
chronic neurological condition due to chronic cyanide poisoning
from eating cassava.
   Each winner will receive a $50,000 prize. The recipients were to
be honored at a reception and dinner Wednesday night featuring
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan as keynote
speaker.
   The newly established award is named in honor of Charles R.
Drew, a physician-scientist credited with saving thousands of lives
during World War II through pioneering work in blood preservation.
   An announcement by Howard University Hospital said the Drew
prize was intended ``to recognize outstanding achievements by
people of color who have made significant lifetime contributions in
public health, health research or the delivery of health care.''

<HEAD>Likud Hard-liners, Labor Doves Want To Scrap Israel's Coalition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hard-liners in Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc demanded dismantling of the coalition
government Wednesday, saying the rival Labor Party was working
toward establishment of a Palestinian state.
   Doves in the left-leaning Labor Party, Likud's coalition
partner, also said the government should end.
   In the occupied lands, four Palestinians were shot and wounded
in clashes with Israeli troops, Arab hospitals said. The army
command said two soldiers were slightly hurt when acid was thrown
at them in the West Bank town of Hebron.
   Two firebombs were thrown at an Israeli car in annexed east
Jerusalem. The driver was burned on the arm and his leg was injured
when he lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a wall, police
spokesman Uzi Sandouri said.
   A bomb exploded under a truck in a Jewish neighborhood in
Jerusalem, slightly damaging the truck but causing no injuries,
police said.
   Likud hard-liners rallied in Tel Aviv to urge rejection of a
U.S.-proposed meeting of Israeli, Egyptian and American officials
to work out terms for Israeli-Palestinian talks in Cairo.
   Led by Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, among others, they view
U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's idea as an attempt to
lure Israel into talks with the PLO and trade territory for peace.
   The two-hour, informal gathering was attended by hundreds of
representatives of Likud's 2,400-member governing central committee
who support hard-line ministers in the Likud-Labor government
formed last Dec. 22.
   ``If Labor continues to bother us in Parliament and the media
and to seek assistance of the Americans, the Egyptians and other
countries, I propose to go to elections,'' Economy Minister Yitzhak
Modai declared, to applause.
   ``They are going to lead us toward a Palestinian state, which
would endanger Israel's existence and which they see as a guarantee
of prosperity and peace. The rift is enormous.''
   Israel radio said Shamir had asked rebellious leaders to cancel
the session, saying it would complicate the political process.
   Senior officials in Finance Minister Shimon Peres' Labor Party
appeared willing to wait, but several dovish leaders in the party
said the government should be brought down.
   ``Likud's refusal to accept the Baker initiative would lead us
to government dismantling,'' said Chaim Ramon, head of Labor's
Parliament faction. ``The possibilities are open: elections ... or
a government led by us or being in opposition.''
   He told Israel TV after a meeting with other Labor ministers,
``We are united in our view that an end to the peace initiative
will lead to the end of our partership, but we are not united
regarding the timing now, or in two weeks or after Shamir's visit
to the United States'' in November.
   Israel has occupied the West Bank and Gaza Strip since capturing
them from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Middle East war. The United
States wants Israel to give up some occupied land for peace, but
Likud opposes returning any territory.
   ``This meeting confirms the real stand of Likud,'' said Sharon.
   He repeated his demand that the 22-month Palestinian uprising be
brought to an end before any negotiations start.
   Shamir leans toward the Baker idea, but only on condition the
tripartite meeting be devoted to Israel's own peace plan. It calls
for elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to choose Palestinian
negotiators for talks on limited autonomy.
   Baker advanced his proposal after Israel's decision-making,
12-member inner Cabinet split along party lines Friday and rejected
an Egyptian offer to act as host for an Israeli-Palestinian
discussion of the election plan in Cairo.
   Labor supported acceptance of the Egyptian invitation, designed
to bypass Israel's opposition to talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The coalition was shaken further Wednesday when Shamir sent a
letter to Peres, demanding that Deputy Finance Minister Yossi
Beilin, known for his dovish views, be fired. Peres has refused to
dismiss his top aide.

<HEAD>Body of Soviet Yachtsman Found Hanging from Tree</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PUNTA DEL ESTE, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The body of the co-captain of a
Soviet yacht participating in the Fifth Whitbread Round The World
Race was found hanging from a tree Wednesday near this seaside
resort, police said.
   Police said the body of Alexei Gryshenko, reported missing
Tuesday by crew of the yacht Fasizi, was found by a passearching for firewood
in a pine grove two miles from Punta del
Este.
   A letter, written in Russian and apparently dated Monday, was
found nearby, said police officers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Soviet Embassy in the Uruguayan caser-by who
was pital of Montevideo, 88
miles west of this beach resort, said it had no information
regarding the discovery of Gryshenko's body.
   Gryshenko and Skip Novak of the United States served as
co-captains of Fasizi, which arrived here on Oct. 1, the seventh
yacht to complete the first of six legs of the 33,000-mile
Whitbread race.
   Fasizi, sponsored by Pepsi Cola and Aeroflot, the Soviet
airline, was among 23 yachts that left Southampton, England, on
Sept. 2, on the 6,200-mile voyage to Punta del Este. The vessels
are scheduled to begin the next leg to Fremante, Australia, on Oct.
28.
   Police said Gryshenko, wearing a blue sweatshirt, jeans and
white sneakers, had been reported missing Tuesday by members of
Fasiis was a legitimate sighting.
   Knell thinks he knows why the people who spotted something in
Queens never saw aliens or spoke with them.
   ``I believe they have their own agenda, and at this time it
doesn't include communication,'' said Knell, who addressed several
skeptical reporters at the site where the UFO allegedly burned the
ground.
   Unfortunately, that's also the site where the remnants of a
downed tree were piled, killing off all the grass underneath, said
park maintenance man Joe Mackey, 60.
   ``If there was a spot around here burned out, I woulda known
about it,'' said Mackey, who spends three days a week in the park.
``It's a figment of somebody's imagination.''
   Perhaps, but Knell's not alone. Some residents of Mississippi's
Delta region say the Soviet description of a UFO is similar to a
fast-moving metallic ball they spotted earlier this month.
   Lee Abide Jr. said he first saw the object about three or four
months ago. He saw it again early Wednesday while on his way to
work at Abide Aero Flying Service about five miles south of
Greenville.
   ``And it didn't come out of a bottle of vodka,'' he said,
referring to some speculation about the Soviet witnesses.
   Bill Kimmel, a pilot, said he saw the object two days ago while
flying to Memphis, Tenn. He said it was round, metallic, kept
changing colors and was moving 800 to 900 mph at 3,000 feet some
distance off his left wingtip.
   ``There was no way it was a weather balloon because no balloon
can travel that fast,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Hurricane Hugo killed 26 people in
Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands when it swept through the
area in September, the American Red Cross said Wednesday.
   The figure brings to at least 74 the total number known dead
from the hurricane, which devastated several Caribbean islands as
well as parts of the Carolinas.
   The Red Cross said in a release that 18 people died in Puerto
Rico and eight died in the Virgin Islands, including five on the
resort island of St. Croix and three on nearby St. Thomas.
   Previous reports indicated 14 had died in Puerto Rico and three
in the Virgin Islands.
   The numbers include those killed during the storm Sept. 17-18
and subsequent hurricane-related deaths, such as injured victims
who later died and power linesmen killed while repairing downed
lines, said Red Cross spokeswoman Susan Clowe.
   The storm also killed 11 in Guadeloupe, 11 in Montserrat, one in
St. Kitts and 25 in North and South Carolina, authorities have said.
   The release also said the Red Cross has served more than 7
million meals in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands since the
hurricane struck, including 113,000 Tuesday.
   It said 217 Red Cross shelters were currently housing 10,458
people in the two territories, down from 21,168 housed right after
the passage of Hugo.
   About 15,000 homes were destroyed and 35,000 damaged in Puerto
Rico, the release said.
   The Virgin Islands government estimated 90 percent of homes were
destroyed or damaged on St. Croix.

   President Bush said in a Wednesday meeting
with the president of Italy that the United States is concerned
about an Italian company suspected of selling the Soviet Union
technology used to build a supersonic jetfighter, officials said.
   The United States notified Italy earlier this month that
Olivetti, one of Europe's largest computer and office equipment
companies, was suspected of violating bans on the transfer of
sophisticated technology to the communist bloc, said Italian
Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis.
   ``We are now investigating in Rome,'' De Michelis said, adding
that the results of the investigation would be conveyed at an Oct.
22 meeting in the Italian capital with Assistant Secretary of State
Reginald Bartholomew.
   President Francesco Cossiga told Bush that the investigation
into the Olivetti allegations was ``being pursued in ... a highly
cooperative manner,'' Assistant Secretary of State Raymond Seitz
told reporters.
   U.S. and Italian officials declined to discuss the suspected
sale publicly, citing the sensitive nature of the information.
   ``This is essentially an intelligence source,'' said one
official.
   Another American official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Olivetti was suspected of having sold the Soviets machine
tools and computer software that was used to manufacture components
for a highly sophisticated jetfighter known as the Yak-41. The
plane is capable of taking off vertically.
   Another official said the sales had been going on for several
years, and involved ``less than $50 million.''
   The Milan newspaper Corriere Della Sera said in a report on the
matter that unspecified ``military sources'' confirmed that
Olivetti sales of systems and software enabled the plane to be
produced.
   In Rome, Premier Giulio Andreotti met for about an hour
Wednesday with Olivetti chairman Carlo De Benedetti, one of the
most powerful businessmen in Europe. Neither made any statements at
the end of the meeting.
   Italy is one of 17 members of the Paris-based Coordinating
Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, which regulates the sale
of high technology to communist countries. Problems have arisen
often in recent years regarding sales of so-called ``dual use''
technology, which can be converted to manufacture weapons.
   The most well-known case of such a violation involved the sale
to the Soviets of computerized milling equipment by Toshiba of
Japan and the Norwegian state-owned Kongsberg conglomerate. The
equipment was used by the Soviets to make silent propellers for
submarines, making them harder for the West to detect.
   As a result, Congress passed legislation last year empowering
the administration to impose sanctions, including import bans,
against companies found in violation of COCOM.
   De Michelis said the main thrust of the Cossiga talks with Bush
was prospects for peace in the Middle East, the upcoming elections
in Nicaragua and reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Cossiga, speaking on the White House lawn before his meeting
with Bush, urged more financial assistance to help those political
changes succeed.
   ``I'm thinking in particular of the great Polish nation that is
currently in the throes serious difficulty in its courageous
attempt to work its renewal and which needs more substantial aid
from us,'' he said.
   Seitz told reporters that Bush and Cossiga ``waxed philosophical
about East-West issues and the importance of defense throughout
this period of change in Europe.''
   Later at a state dinner, the American president lauded the
friendship between Italy and the United States, saying the ties
have ``never been stronger'' and paying tribute to the ``new
Italy'' as a ``great and growing economic power, one of the world's
foremost democracies, a strong and valued ally and a partner in the
community of free nations.''
   Cossiga said western nations were under an obligation to
encourage reform in the Eastern Bloc countries, and members of the
European Common Market ``intend to redouble their efforts to
establish a climate of ever greater mutual confidence and to
restore increasingly close economic cultural and human relations
throughout the European continent.''

<HEAD>Top-Ranking Trafficker Nabbed; Newspaper Closes Medellin Office</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with reported letter from Medellin
cartel leader seeking peace talks with the government; EDITS to trim. No

<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top-ranking member of the Medellin
cocaine cartel who resorted to plastic surgery to avoid arrest was
captured and will face extradition to the United States, police
said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile the reputed leader of the cartel, the largest in the
world, reportedly asked the Colombian government to begin peace
talks with drug traffickers. Pablo Escobar also said in the
reported letter that news reports of previous government
negotiations with drug lords were true.
   The Bogota daily El Espectador temporarily closed its Medellin
office after drug lords killed two of the newspaper's employees
there and threatened to murder the bureau's remaining staff of 11.
An executive of the anti-drug crusading newspaper said officials
will study how to improve office security.
   The Administrative Security Department said the suspected drug
trafficker who was captured, Jose Abello Silva, was arrested
Tuesday in a Bogota restaurant. The office said in a communique
that he had undergone facial surgery to avoid easy detection.
   It also said Abello is the fourth-ranking person in the Medellin
cocaine cartel and the most important suspect arrested since
Colombia began cracking down on cocaine lords Aug. 19.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Harri J. Kramer said
a federal grand jury in Tulsa, Okla., indicted Abello in 1987 on
charges of conspiring to import and distribute cocaine.
   Kramer said the Justice Department had requested that Abello and
a suspect arrested Wednesday, Manuel Palma, be held for extradition.
   Palma is wanted by federal authorities in Miami on charges of
interstate travel in aid of racketeering in connection with an
operation to launder drug money, Kramer said.
   Details of Palma's arrest were not immediately available from
Colombia police.
   Neither Palma nor Abello is on the U.S. Justice Department's
list of 12 most wanted traffickers, but the department has said it
wants dozens of other Colombians on federal drug charges.
   Cornelius Dougherty, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said in Washington Abello was responsible for
``major shipments of cocaine and marijuana into the states.''
   Colombia's Administrative Security Department said Abello was
the cartel's chief of operations for Colombia's northern coast,
where dozens of clandestine air strips are used to smuggle 300 to
400 tons of cocaine into the United States each year.
   The federal police force said legal documents from the U.S.
government for extraditing Abello were being processed.
   So far Colombia has extradited one suspected trafficker; four,
including Abello, are awaiting extradition.
   A letter reportedly signed by Escobar and delivered to the
director of a Bogota newspaper asked for mediation by the press,
political and church leaders and the judicial branch in a ``direct
dialogue'' between the government and the drug traffickers.
   The letter reportedly was addressed to Juan Carlos Pastrana,
director of La Prensa newspaper, and the text was read in a
broadcast by the national radio network Caracol.
   ``In the same way that war decrees can be issued so can peace
decrees be issued,'' Escobar said, refering to the hard-line
measures against drug traffickers adopted by President Virgilio
Barco after the Aug. 18 assassination of a leading presidential
candidate.
   As part of the decrees, Barco revived Colombia's extradition
treaty with the United States and confiscated hundreds of millions
of dollars in property believed to belong to drug lords.
   Escobar, the presumed leader of the Medellin cartel _ the
largest in the world _ heads the list of drug suspects wanted by
the United States.
   He is listed by Forbes magazine as one of the 20 wealthiest men
in the world with a fortune exceeding $2 billion.
   The letter attributed to Escobar said the drug lords and the
government first began talking before Sept. 1, 1988, when Barco
included the traffickers in a peace plan originally offered only to
Colombia's leftist guerrillas.
   The president never specifically indicated that drug traffickers
would be included, and government officials have repeatedly said
they never considered talking with the drug lords.
   La Prensa recently reported that Barco's closest adviser, German
Montoya, had received messages from the traffickers seeking a truce
beginning in September 1988.
   Montoya later admitted meeting once with the man carrying the
messages, former Interior Minister Joaquin Vallejo, but said he did
so without the president's knowledge.
   He said he told Vallejo from the beginning that a dialogue was
not possible.
   Vallejo said, however, that he met numerous times with Montoya
and that the contacts ended two days after suspected drug
traffickers assassinated Sen. Luis Carlos Galan Aug. 18.
   The newspaper El Espectador closed its office in Medellin after
an anonymous caller said the Extraditables _ a group of cocaine
traffickers _ had killed the two employees Tuesday and would kill
the others in Medellin if the office remained open.
   ``El Espectador declares that it will be able to survive as a
free newspaper only if the government fulfills its obligation to
protect our lives and properties,'' the paper's directors said in a
letter sent to Interior Minister Carlos Lemmos Simmonds.
   A spokeswoman for the minister's office said there had been no
official response to the letter.
   El Espectador has been the most vociferous of Colombia's
newspapers in editorials calling on the government to crush the
nation's drug trade.

<HEAD>New Hungarian Socialist Party Meets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Rezsoe Nyers of the new
Hungarian Socialist Party declared on Wednesday that ``at present,
there is no communist party in Hungary,'' although ``there are
communists.''
   In an interview with Hungarian TV, Nyers rejected claims by
orthodox communists opposed to the establishment of the new party
that the old party continued to exist.
   The presidium of the Hungarian Socialist Party held its first
meeting on Wednesday as conservative communists apparently kept up
efforts to revive the disbanded Hungarian Socialist Workers
(communist) Party.
   Nyers was chairman of the communist party. He was elected
Socialist Party president at a key party congress this weekend that
voted the old communist party out of existence and founded the new
one.
   He said membership of the party had ``become confused'' by the
change.
   Hungarian radio said 43 communists in the industrial center of
Csepel, just south of Budapest, announced ``they are going to
continue to organize the HSWP and (are) calling on all chapters to
follow suit.''
   They said the delegate they sent to the party congress ``was not
authorized to abandon Marxism-Leninism,'' the radio reported.
   Nyers conceded it was ``likely (they) ... will organize a
communist party.''
   But, he said, ``those who agree with the HSWP line and want to
continue must organize a new party. I do not think they can use the
name HSWP.''
   If the word ``new'' or ``original'' were added to the name,
however, then it ``would be acceptable,'' he went on.
   The English-language Daily News in Budapest said Wednesday
former party ideologist Janos Berecz confirmed he wants ``to stay
on'' as a member of the old communist party. Karoly Grosz,
secretary-general of the party until it was dissolved, repeatedly
has said he wished to remain a member of the old party.
   The independent daily Mai Nap quoted Berecz as saying Tuesday,
``We are staying in the HSWP and I hope that a significant segment
of the membership will do likewise.''
   Also on Tuesday, the state news agency MTI said the extreme
leftist Marxist Unity Platform was encouraging communists to rejoin
the old party.
   Another radical leftwing group, the Ferenc Muennich Society, is
also known to strongly oppose dissolution of the communist party.
   Nyers said the new 25-member presidium at its meeting Wednesday
discussed lower level organization, the fate of party-controlled
assets and of the Workers' Militia, the old party's paramilitary
body.
   He replied when asked about expected membership of the new party
that it was ``impossible to say'' how many of the old party's
720,000 members would want to belong. He speculated it could be
between 50 and 70 percent.

<HEAD>General Assembly Will Hold Anti-Drug Special Session</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A key U.N. committee decided by
acclamation Wednesday to hold a special General Assembly session on
fighting the international drug traffickers.
   The General Assembly's general committee decided without debate
or dissent to have the entire assembly take up the issue Tuesday
and decide when the special session should be held. Most diplomats
expect the session to be held in February.
   Since nearly all of the 159 members of the General Assembly have
delegates on the general committee, approval of the anti-drug
special session is assured.
   The General Assembly seized the initiative after a British
effort to have the Security Council deal with the issue was
withdrawn after many developing nations opposed council involvement
in a social concern.
   Algeria and Brazil particularly opposed the expansion of the
Security Council into areas other than the military aspect of
security, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Colombia's President Virgilio Barco won a standing ovation from
the General Assembly on Sept. 29 when he called on all nations to
ratify the 1988 Vienna Convention on Narcotics Trafficking, which
closes legal loopholes giving drug dealers safe haven in some
countries.
   The treaty, strongly backed by Washington, requires nations to
make drug trafficking illegal, confiscate dealers' property and
bank accounts and extradite drug lords even if there is no
applicable extradition treaty.
   Twenty nations must ratify the treaty before it comes into
effect. So far, only the Bahamas has done so and Washington and
London are considering signing.
   About 100 countries have signed the treaty, the first step
toward ratification.

   The Liberty Monument, a Reconstruction-era
obelisk dedicated to white supremacy, is being removed from
downtown New Orleans' main street to make room for road
construction, city officials say.
   The stone monument stands in the middle of Canal Street near the
Rivergate Convention Center has been the target of civil rights
complaints for years.
   The obelisk is being removed to improve access to the
Mississippi River ferry and the Aquarium of the Americas, which is
scheduled to open next year. The marker will go into storage,
officials said Tuesday.
   It was erected to commemorate the so-called the Battle of
Liberty Place, fought nearby on Sept. 14, 1874.
   The White League, a group of prominent whites angered by alleged
corruption in the state's biracial Republican government, fought
the Metropolitan Police, which supported the Reconstruction regime.
   One source places the day's casualties at 27 killed and 105
wounded. The White League won the day, but Reconstruction was not
finally ended and white ``home rule'' restored until 1877.
   The cornerstone of the monument was laid in 1891. For many
years, wreath-laying ceremonies were held there each Sept. 14.
   In the 1970s, blacks demanding the monument's removal criticized
inscriptions added to it in 1932 extolling white supremacy. In
1974, a plaque repudiating the references to white supremacy was
added to the monument.
   In 1981, Dutch Morial, the city's first black mayor, tried to
have the memorial torn down, but his efforts were blocked by the
City Council. The controversial inscriptions were removed.
   Streets Department Director Betty Jo Everett said she did not
inform Mayor Sidney Barthelemy or the City Council before ordering
the monument removed.
   She said a decision on its fate will be up to a committee that
oversees all city monuments.

<HEAD>Homosexuals Hold `Coming-Out' Day</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of gay men and women across the nation celebrated their
sexuality with rallies, films and discussions Wednesday on the
second annual ``National Coming Out Day.''
   ``National Coming Out Day is great. It's like a holiday,'' said
Tony Cheek, executive assistant at the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian
Community Services Center, where about 500 people gathered.
   The celebration at the center included discussion of such films
as ``The Life and Times of Harvey Milk,'' about San Francisco's
murdered gay city supervisor.
   Cheek said the day's highlight was an open microphone at which
people could tell their own stories of coming out _ gay slang for
publicly acknowledging one's homosexuality.
   ``Some were funny, but there were a lot of tear-jerkers,'' he
said. ``We had a lot of first-timers.''
   In Providence, R.I., about 50 people attended a rowdy Statehouse
rally and said they hoped to inspire tens of thousands of others to
acknowledge their homosexuality.
   None of the demonstrators was ``coming out of the closet'' for
the first time, organizers said. Most were veterans of other gay
pride events, and they said the real coming-out process is one
that's done privately.
   ``My coming out was when I opened the dictionary at age 14 and
looked up the word `homosexual' and realized that applies to me,''
said John Blakeslee, 34, of Providence.
   At the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, students were
asked to wear black or pink to support the celebration. Black,
always a popular choice of students, proliferated on campus by
mid-morning.
   ``This campus is so diverse, civility and being aware of social
issues is really important,'' said Max Mitchell, a senior and
president of the school's Lesbian Bisexual and Gay Alliance.
   In Boston, the Massachusetts Senate gave all but final approval
Wednesday to a bill banning discrimination against homosexuals in
housing, credit and employment.
   The bill, which has died in the Senate for each of the last 17
years, moved along after Senate President William Bulger ruled that
amendments offered by several opponents were merely delaying
tactics.
   ``This really is the people's victory,'' David LaFontaine of the
Coalition for Lesbian and Gay Civil Rights. ``We are going to
herald this as a major step forward in the civil rights movement.''
   The Atlanta Gay Center sponsored a help-line and bought local
advertising to commemorate a homosexual rights march in Washington
two years ago. Gay residents had their names printed in the ads as
part of the commemoration.
   North of San Francisco Bay, the Marin County Board of
Supervisors voted 4-0 to proclaim Wednesday ``Marin Coming Out
Day,'' despite protests by evangelical ministers that the county
should not be endorsing gay lifestyles.
   Ken Searle, pastor at Marin Christian Life Church in Novato,
said he was ``very disappointed'' because the board's action ``will
be perceived by the community as an endorsement of the lifestyle.''
   Supervisor Al Aramburu, one of two who wore ``Coming Out''
buttons, said the proclamation reflects a ``spirit of respect.''
   ``I think we respect one another as human beings,'' he said.
   Cheek said holding the annual day helps end homophobia by
letting the heterosexual world know that there are gays and
lesbians all around them.
   ``If you find out your next door neighbor that you've known all
along is gay, then how can you hate him?'' Cheek said.

   Some aging but still popular TV shows may fade
from the nation's cable systems in January, and the cable industry
wants customers to know who's to blame _ the government.
   The National Cable Television Association is providing cable
systems with short announcements warning viewers that shows such as
``Cheers,'' ``Mork and Mindy,'' and ``Hee-Haw'' may disappear after
Jan. 1.
   The reason is the return of ``syndex,'' industry jargon for the
Federal Communications Commission regulations that allow local,
over-the-air television stations exclusive rights to the
syndicated, non-network programs they show in their market.
   The FCC is reinstating the rules it lifted in 1980 as a way to
boost the then-infant cable industry.
   If the rules survive pending court challenges, some reruns may
disappear completely in some cities. That could happen if cable
systems, forced to black out some time slots from ``distant''
stations that carry the same programs as local broadcasters, decide
to drop the out-of-town stations entirely.
   Cable operators, fearing a backlash from viewers, are using the
announcements as a pre-emptive strike to make sure customers knows
it's not their fault.
   Preston Padden, president of the Association of Independent
Television Stations, is a proponent of reinstating the syndex rules.
   ``Our entire constitutional copyright system is based on
recognizing and honoring contracts between creators and
exhibitors,'' Padden said.
   But Steven J. Simmons, chairman of Simmons Communications Inc.,
says the rules are ``terribly unfriendly to consumers.''
   Simmons, whose company has 350,000 subscribers in 20 states,
said broadcasters have indicated they will claim exclusivity for
programs such as ``The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' ``Who's the Boss?',
``Hee-Haw,'' ``Simon and Simon,'' ``The A-Team,'' ``Wheel of
Fortune,'' ``M.A.S.H.,'' ``I Love Lucy,'' ``Golden Girls,'' ``A
Current Affair,'' ``Donahue,'' ``Amen'' and ``Mork and Mindy.''
   Those shows would be carried on only one station in any market,
Simmons said in a telephone interview from his Stamford, Conn.,
office.
   ``The requirements could have such an impact that a cable
company, rather than have a subscriber sit there and watch
essentially Swiss cheese ... may just decide to drop the channel
altogether,'' Simmons said.
   The rules would affect national ``superstations'' such as WTBS
in Atlanta, WGN in Chicago and WWOR in New York and so-called
regional TV stations such as WPIX in New York and KTLA in Los
Angeles.
   Turner Broadcasting System, which owns WTBS, Turner Network
Television and Cable News Network, said WTBS would be
``syndex-proof.'' TBS is telling cable operators it will indemnify
them against any syndex problems.
   ``We've already made arrangements to have a blackout-free
schedule,'' Bert Carp, a TBS official in Washington, said in a
recent interview. He said TBS had managed to either acquire
national exclusivity for its programs or acquire new programs.

<TEXT>
   Veteran labor leader Saul
Ubaldini was voted out of office Wednesday in a political victory
for President Carlos Menem.
   The secretary-general of the General Labor Confederation was
unseated at a rowdy congress punctuated the day before by
fistfights and clashes between rival union members wielding iron
bars, clubs, chains, bottles and stones.
   Guerino Andreoni, leader of the commerce workers union, was
elected to replace Ubaldini as head of the 3 million-member
confederation. Most of the members work at state companies,
including the national airlines and railroad, which have been
losing tens of millions of dollars annually for years.
   Ubaldini had been considered a rival capable of undermining
Menem's economic policy. Menem has held down workers' wages as a
way to halt inflation, which soared by 197 percent in July, the
month he took office. The September increase was 9.4 percent.
   The president also pressured state rail workers to end a strike
last month, and caused concern among state employees about their
jobs and benefits by pledging to sell money-losing public companies
to balance the budget.
   Ubaldini insisted he did not oppose Menem, but always stressed
his independence.
   ``Nothing and no one will impede our fight'' to improve workers'
welfare, he said on Aug. 17, hours after his car was damaged by a
bomb.
   During the 1983-89 presidency of Raul Alfonsin, which ended in
July, Ubaldini organized 13 general strikes and pressed for
increases in the national minumum wage, public programs to reduce
unemployment and a halt to payments on Argentina's foreign debt.
   Menem had tried to oust Ubaldini since his labor-based Peronist
Party swept presidential and congressional elections May 14,
offering the trade unionist a high-level post in an overseas
embassy, among other things.
   But the beer workers union chief, who has led the labor
confederation since 1980, refused.
   Menem made no immediate comment on Ubaldini's ouster, nor did
Labor Minister Jorge Triaca or their ally in the trade union
movement, foodworkers union chief Luis Barrionuevo.
   But soon after the confederation's entire 20-member board of
directors was replaced late Wednesday, Barrionuevo told reporters
he briefed Menem on the development and Government House officially
recognized the new confederation leadership.
   Ubaldini's term does not expire until February 1990, and the
fiery unionist pledged to stay on until then.
   ``We have not resigned,'' he told cheering, chanting supporters
gathered outside confederation headquarters in San Telmo
neighborhood near Buenos Aires' port. ``The secretary general
continues to be me.''
   In an editorial titled ``Labor At the Crossroad,'' the
English-language Buenos Aires Herald newspaper criticized the
scuffles that broke out Tuesday outside the convention hall where
1,600 confederation delegates gathered.
   ``At stake is whether the government can continue to tame the
inflation which has fallen from nearly 200 percent in July to
single digits in September, or whether a wage offensive spearheaded
by Ubaldini ... will drive a coach and horse through government
incomes policy,'' it said.

   Suspended Navajo Tribal Chairman Peter
MacDonald was accused of 111 criminal charges Wednesday, including
bribery, fraud, conspiracy and elections violations while he led
the nation's largest Indian tribe.
   Special prosecutors hired by the Tribal Council filed a
five-pronged complaint in Navajo District Court in Window Rock, the
tribal capital, after a four-hour review of the charges by Judge
Robert Yazzie.
   Shortly before the charges were disclosed, MacDonald denounced
them as ``baloney.''
   ``They are the same old laundry that they've been hanging out
for the last year and a half,'' he told The Associated Press later,
after learning of the specific charges.
   One complaint charges MacDonald with 27 counts of bribery,
fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy in the tribe's $33.4
million purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch in northern Arizona in
July 1987.
   Allegations that MacDonald personally profited from the ranch
purchase emerged in U.S. Senate subcommittee testimony earlier this
year.
   A second complaint alleges 25 violations of the Navajo election
law, including charges that MacDonald accepted $115,500 in
undocumented cash and service constributions from non-Indians and
corporations.
   A third charges MacDonald with 59 counts of bribery, extortion,
fraud, ethics violations and conspiracy in alleged fradulent
consultant contracts MacDonald purportedly entered into with
outside businesses from November 1986 through 1989. Prosecutors
allege he pocketed over $300,000.
   If convicted on all 111 counts, MacDonald could be sentenced to
15 years in tribal jail and fined as much as $59,500.
   MacDonald's son Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. is charged with
conspiracy in the ranch purchase in a fourth complaint and tribal
Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is accused of ethics violations in
the fifth.
   Prosecutors did not break down the complaints against Thompson
or the younger MacDonald.
   Court officials said people listed in the complaint would
probably receive summonses from the Navajo Department of Justice
within 14 days.
   The special prosecutors, members of the Santa Fe, N.M., law firm
of Rothstein, Bennett, Daly, Donatelli and Hughes, were appointed
by the Tribal Council in March to ``investigate any possible
wrongdoing by former and current tribal officials,'' said tribal
spokesman Duane Beyal.
   MacDonald, speaking to reporters in this north-central Arizona
community shortly before the contents of the charges were disclosed
in Window Rock, 150 miles southeast, said the charges would be
trumped-up.
   ``I don't care what it is, it's going to be a bunch of baloney
and whatever court it goes to it's going to be proven its a bunch
of baloney,'' MacDonald said.
   He reiterated his claim that the federal government wanted to
oust him and other strong Indian leaders so it could have easier
access to minerals and other natural resources on reservations.
   ``We have made mistakes, I'm sure,'' MacDonald said. ``But we
have nowhere near as bad a record as whites have as our trustees in
bringing poverty and hunger and illiteracy and alcoholism to native
Americans.
   ``We have nowhere near the record of whites in stealing Indian
land, Indian oil, Indian coal, Indian gas, and Indian water,'' he
said.
   Special prosecutor Robert Rothstein, who released the contents
of the complaint, said 75 to 100 people were investigated,
including members of the administrations of MacDonald and interim
Chairman Leonard Haskie.
   Haskie said the tribe appointed the prosecutors to ``protect the
best interest of the Navajo people'' and file charges if warranted.
He said he had has asked the federal government to expedite its
investigation of MacDonald.
   That probe focuses on allegations made during the Senate
subcommittee testimony in January that MacDonald and his family
profited from the tribe's purchase of the 491,000-acre ranch.
   The council put MacDonald on administrative leave with pay on
Feb. 13. On March 10, it named Haskie interim chairman and placed
Thompson on leave.
   MacDonald has said the 88-member council acted illegally by
replacing a chairman without a two-thirds majority, but tribal
courts have upheld the actions.
   At his news conference, MacDonald declined to answer questions
about past allegations.
   ``I'm exercising my rights,'' he said when asked why he had
resisted turning over documents sought by tribal and federal
investigators.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Allen Stooks of Phoenix did not return a
phone call for comment on the status of the federal investigation.
   The tribe purchased the Big Boquillas from Tracey Oil and Gas
Co., which had bought it a short time earlier from Tenneso West for
$26.2 million.
   The tribal complaint alleges that Tracey, Byron ``Bud'' Brown,
the broker, and MacDonald agreed to divide the $7.2 million profit
among themselves.
   It further alleges that MacDonald concealed the ranch's true
value from the tribe and used his position as chairman to inflate
the ranch's appraised value, speed the sale and conceal his
personal gain.
   Earlier this year, the tribe filed suit in Maricopa County
Superior Court in Phoenix, seeking to recover $24 million in
damages from MacDonald and others in the ranch purchase.

   A company cannot hide behind a
``corporate veil'' to avoid funding the cleanup of a toxic chemical
spill caused by a subsidiary, a federal judge ruled Wednesday in
one of the first such cases in the country.
   Kayser-Roth Corp.'s tight control over subsidiary Stamina Mills
Inc. makes it liable to pay $846,492 to clean up a 1969 release of
trichlorethylene, or TCE, that the government contends contaminated
nearby drinking wells, U.S. District Judge Francis J. Boyle ruled.
   ``Kayser-Roth had the power to control the release or threat of
release of TCE, had the power to direct the mechanisms causing the
release, and had the ultimate ability to prevent and abate
damage,'' Boyle wrote.
   Deming Sherman, Kayser-Roth's attorney, and U.S. Justice
Department lawyer Cynthia Huber said they believed it was the first
Superfund case prosecuted by the federal government in which a U.S.
judge made a parent corporation liable for the actions of its
subsidiary.
   Kayser-Roth, a hosiery and apparel manufacturer, argued it could
not be forced to pay because it was protected from liability by a
``corporate veil'' that shielded it from the acts of its
subsidiary, which operated a now-defunct woolen mill in North
Smithfield.
   The corporate veil, a long-established legal doctrine, protects
investors in new ventures from losing all their assets and is a
major reason that most business activities are carried on by
corporations.
   The veil is rarely pierced, and only when a parent company is
shown to have overwhelmingly controlled its subsidiary.
   The judge said Kayser-Roth fit that category because of its
total control over Stamina's finances, its order that Stamina refer
environmental matters to Kayser-Roth's legal department, and its
approval of all Stamina real estate deals and capital purchases
greater than $5,000.
   Boyle also said Kayser-Roth executives served as most of
Stamina's officers and directors.
   ``Kayser-Roth has exhibited overwhelming pervasive control over
Stamina Mills,'' Boyle wrote.
   The judge said he was concerned primarily with furthering the
Superfund law's intent to let the government collect the cleanup
costs in hazardous waste cases.
   The law ``attempts to address nationwide public health and
environmental problems'' and ``places no special importance upon
the corporate structure,'' Boyle wrote.
   Sherman called it ``a pretty broad opinion'' and said he
believed Kayser-Roth would have case law on its side if it decided
to appeal.
   The Wall Street Journal recently reported that three federal
judges in the past five months, including Boyle, had declined to
dismiss cases based on corporate veil arguments. An agreement in
principal had been reached to settle one of those cases, against
T&amp;N PLC, an English holding company, the newspaper said.
   The government has sought to pierce the corporate veil because
parent companies often have greater resources to pay for hazardous
waste cleanups than do their subsidiaries.
   Boyle also rejected Kayser-Roth's argument that the government
could not prove the wells were contaminated by Stamina Mills.
   ``On this record it is sheer speculation to suggest that there
was any other source of TCE,'' the judge said.
   The judgment includes $660,612 to the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency and $185,879 to the Justice Department.
Kayser-Roth also will be liable for any future cleanup costs at the
Stamina site, Boyle wrote.

   Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the reputed
leader of the largest cocaine cartel in the world, reportedly sent
a letter to the director of the newspaper La Prensa Wednesday
asking for helping in arranging peace talks with the government.
   Escobar heads the list of Colombian drug traffickers wanted by
the United States. The following is a translation by The AP of the
letter, read over the national radio chain Caracol:
   (1) The conversations between us and the government began many
days before the government offered its peace proposal to the
Colombian people.
   (2) Present at the conversations were those of us mentioned by
the national and international press. We made various proposals and
expressed our point of view in several different meetings.
   (3) In those meetings, we complained of the abuses committed
against our innocent families, of the arbitrary detentions of our
elderly and our women, of the repressive raids, of the
confiscations and all the other types of outrages.
   (4) We also let the government know that we have not been, nor
will be, ready to permit these types of infamous violations of all
of our rights.
   (5) We also raised the issue of a Colombian peace founded on a
direct dialogue with the commanders of the country's different
(army) brigades, with the commanders of the different guerrilla
groups, with the commanders the paramilitary and self-defense
groups, with the representatives of the emerald miners and with the
leaders of the different groups of extraditables. One of our own
ideas, the text of one of our own phrases, was included in the text
of the president's Sept. 1, 1988, speech concerning his peace plan.
   
   Mr. Director: For the sake of peace we ask publicly for your
mediation and for the mediation of the other directors of the
country's important newspapers. We ask publicly for the mediation
of the Catholic Church, and for the participation of the political
class, the judicial powers represented by their unions and
magistrates. We ask publicly for the participation of the
government and the public promise of guarantees, both physical and
judicial, for the participants in the direct dialogue in the search
for peace.
   Mr. Director: Just as war decrees can be issued so can peace
decrees be issued. Colombian peace is more important than the
considerations and conceptions of the other governments of the
world. Pablo Escobar Gaviria

   A man was arraigned Wednesday on two
counts of murder in the killing of two prostitutes, but police said
he was not a suspect in the slayings of four other Oakland
prostitutes in the last three months.
   Dewain Hall, 26, did not enter a plea during a brief appearance
before Municipal Court Judge Horace Wheatley. Investigators said
Hall has confessed to the charges, which include two counts of
attempted murder.
   Hall was arrested Monday night after he was turned in by a woman
who said he told her about the slayings, then forced her at
gunpoint to shoot a passerby so she would not turn him in to
authorities, police said.
   Hall, a paroled convict, is accused of killing Annie Green, 29,
on Sept. 20, and Teresa Ann Greenlee, 26, whose body was found five
days later.
   The attempted murder charges stem from the passerby shooting and
the Sept. 24 wounding of a third prostitute who refused to date
Hall, police said.

   The House on Wednesday refused to take up a
measure that would have ordered the Census Bureau to exclude
illegal aliens from next year's census.
   It was a test of strength that pitted Sunbelt states whose
populations have been swollen by illegal aliens against Frostbelt
states that stand to lose House seats after the census.
   By 232-184, the House used a parliamentary maneuver steered by
Rep. Silvio O. Conte, R-Mass., to keep the census measure off the
floor.
   That was the vote by which the House instructed its negotiators
in House-Senate talks to accept a provision in the Senate version
of the State, Justice and Commerce appropriations bill to condemn
the continuation in power of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in Panama.
   The rules permit only one set of instructions to a conference
committee. Thus Rep. Thomas Ridge, R-Pa., was blocked from offering
his own set of instructions on the census question to the House
members of the same committee.
   Ridge's provisions would have ordered the House negotiators to
accept another Senate-passed provision, this one to barring the use
of any money for the Census Bureau to count illegal aliens in its
1990 head count.
   The census bureau has always counted residents regardless of
citizenship. Past efforts to exclude illegal aliens from the count
have always died in committee.
   The matter is important to several northeastern and midwestern
states which expect to lose House seats in redistricting following
that census.
   Under current census rules, California, Florida and Texas, with
many illegal aliens, expect to gain House seats while New York,
Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Illinois are among those expected
to lose seats.
   Even though it was apparent they would not have a chance to get
a vote on the Ridge proposal, backers of the census change used the
hour devoted to the Noriega censure to debate the census issue.
   Ridge and others characterized it as a matter of political
fairness. ``I want equal representation for American citizens,''
argued Rep. William Goodling, R-Pa.
   Opponents argued that any change in census rules at this point
would cost $1 billion, including the cost of reprinting forms and
retraining the enumerators. They said it was not clear that the
census-takers could even get accurate information on citizenship.
   Rep. William Ford, D-Ky., called it, ``A fantasy'' that states
losing seats could save any by excluding aliens from the count.
   Opponents have said the Senate provision is clearly
unconstitutional, since the Constitution requires a census of
``persons.'' When the Constitution wants something to apply only to
citizens, it clearly says ``citizens,'' according to this argument.
   Supporters have argued that the Constitution gives Congress the
power to impose rules for the Census.

   The Socialist Party, Japan's major opposition
party, was challenged in Parliament on Wednesday to reply to
allegations that it tilted in favor of the pinball industry after
being fed sizeable donations.
   Koichi Hamada, a legislator of the governing Liberal Democrats,
cited a published report that eight Socialists helped water down
legislation regulating pachinko, a widely played form of pinball in
which winners receive prizes.
   The weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun said the eight received
donations from a national association of pachinko parlor owners
ranging from $1,400 to $3,500.
   Hamada, whose own party was badly hurt at the polls this year by
a major influence-peddling scandal, addressed his questions to the
justice minister during Budget Committee debate in the lower house.
   ``There have been allegations that some legislators have acted
to protect the (pachinko) industry while they were not supposed to
do so,'' he said.
   ``I will not name them right now, but the issue involves
something to be called the second Recruit scandal.''
   By Recruit Hamada was referring to a scandal in which leading
politicians and bureaucrats received donations or cut-price stock
shares from Recruit Co., a major information services conglomerate
accused of trying to influence government policy. Bribery charges
have been filed in that case.
   The justice minister replied he was aware of the allegations and
assumed that prosecutors were interested in the case.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, Socialist secretary-general, has acknowledged
that some party members received donations from the pachinko
association, including $31,000 for party chairwoman Takako Doi, but
said all the donations were legal.
   The magazine said donations to Ms. Doi, known to be a pachinko
fan, were in the form of ticket purchases for parties in her honor.
   The Recruit scandal and an unpopular new 3 percent sales tax
were major factors in the Liberal Democrats' losing their majority
in Parliament's upper house for the first time in 34 years in
elections in July. The Socialists were the major gainers in the
election.
   About 15,000 pachinko parlors operate across Japan, with annual
sales estimated at nearly $21 billion, Shukan Bunshun said.
   To help in investigating any tax evasion by the pachinko
industry, the National Police Agency has sought to introduce a
system in which customers would use prepaid cards, rather than
cash, to play pachinko machines.
   Socialist legislators strongly opposed such a system.

<HEAD>80 Bodies Of Sinhalese Youths Found</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bound bodies of 80 Sinhalese
youths, all shot and some set on fire, were found along a southern
road on Wednesday and authorities blamed pro-government death
squads.
   No one claimed responsibility, but authorities speculated the
killings were the work of death squads out to avenge the ambush
slayings of three Sinhalese soldiers in the district on Monday.
   The bodies were discovered one day before the government and
opposition parties wrap up monthlong peace talks aimed at resolving
Sri Lanka's ethnic differences. More than 16,000 people have died
in the strife.
   The bodies were found in groups of six or eight along a 20-mile
stretch of road between Panadura and Mataguma, said police
officials, who could not be identified under briefing rules.
   The towns are in Kalutara district, about 25 miles south of
Colombo.
   Officials said the victims were aged 18 to 30. Their hands were
tied behind their backs and the bodies bore gunshot wounds. Some
bodies were afire, they said.
   The ambush on Monday was blamed on Sinhalese militants of the
People's Liberation Front, a group trying to topple the government
for two years now.
   Human rights groups and opposition parties allege that vigilante
groups are killing sympathizers of the front, a charge denied by
President Ranasinghe Premadasa and his government.
   A Foreign Ministry official said Wednesday that a team of the
International Committee of the Red Cross will arrive Oct. 17 on an
invitation by Premadasa to monitor human rights practices in Sri
Lanka.
   The official, who also could not be identified under briefing
rules, said the Geneva-based body will send a preliminary team. He
had no details.
   Officials have said about 25 people a day are being killed in
the battle between Sinhalese radicals, the military and death
squads.
   Independent groups say the government encouraged the vigilantes
after the military failed to put down Sinhalese extremists.
   The front began attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government
after it signed a peace accord in July 1987 designed to give
greater autonomy to the island nation's Tamil minority.
   The accord followed six years of Tamil insurgency in the
northeast where most Tamils live and want to set up a separate
homeland. The insurrection has claimed 11,000 lives.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people. They
allege discrimination in jobs and education by the Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the population and control the government and
the military.
   Last month Premadasa convened a peace conference of 21 of the
country's 27 recognized political parties. It was boycotted by the
front.
   The conference is due to hold its final round of talks Thursday.

   Denis Goldberg no longer feels uneasy in a crowd.
But whenever he sits down to write his memoirs, the recollections
of 21 years in a South African prison still overwhelm him.
   He served the longest prison term imposed on a white militant,
and now is in his fifth year in British exile. But he says the
ideals that got him, Nelson Mandela and six other black
nationalists locked up for plotting to overthrow the white-led
minority government made his life sentence bearable.
   ``I didn't count every day I was in prison, but I calculated
it,'' Goldberg, now 56, says in an interview. ``I was there 7,904
days. I don't regret one day, it was worth it.
   ``I certainly do not repudiate my past actions. I do not
repudiate the armed struggle _ I think it's essential.''
   At 29, Goldberg was an engineer turned bomb-maker for the
African National Congress, the banned black nationalist movement.
He was arrested at an ANC hideout in Johannesburg and given three
life sentences in June 1964 for ``campaigning to overthrow the
government by violent revolution.''
   Deported in 1985 after undertaking not to participate in
political violence, he now runs the ANC's mail order business in
north London selling mostly T-shirts and posters. He lectures
occasionally in Britain and abroad.
   On Tuesday, President F.W. de Klerk said he will free five of
Goldberg's co-defendants, including ANC political strategist Walter
Sisulu, but not Mandela.
   The other co-defendant, Govan Mbeki, was freed in 1987.
   Goldberg calls their release ``a public relations exercise to
show de Klerk is amenable to change.''
   It took Goldberg two years to adjust to freedom in London.
Finally, one morning, ``suddenly I felt at ease; The crowds didn't
bother me.''
   ``There's a lot of softness and gentleness outside that is
enriching,'' he says. ``It sounds corny but it's very, very true. I
find life incredibly exciting, fulfilling and worthwhile.''
   His wife Esme, 60, says: ``Prison made him tender.''
   But the memories of prison run deep.
   ``I find that when I do sit down to write about it, I simply
don't sleep,'' he said. ``A recollection of one incident brings
back a whole chain of incidents and events, and I find that this
just overwhelms me.''
   The former engineer said he gradually was driven to violence by
revulsion for apartheid, the race-separation system under which 5
million whites disenfranchise 28 million blacks.
   He's chubbier now and losing his hair, and his quirky humor
masks a deep hurt at having missed seeing his two children grow up.
   His son, David, was 8 and his daughter, Hilary, 5 when he left
Cape Town in May 1963, intent on fleeing abroad. A bomb had
exploded in his garden, obscenities were painted on his car and
police were clamping down on dissidents. He stayed on briefly to
organize arms production for the ANC.
   ``Had I not been arrested, I would have gone on to start
production of land mines and grenades and timing devices and so
on,'' he says. ``Bomb-maker is a pejorative term. My people said
that what I was doing was just and justified.''
   Goldberg served most of his sentence in the whites-only Pretoria
Prison.
   ``In a country where prison is the norm in the lives of most
black South Africans, it was perhaps a way of identifying,'' he
said. ``That we could survive and come out relatively whole people
is really a victory over people who try to smash us.''
   He first visited his daughter at a kibbutz in Israel before
flying to Britain, where his wife and son moved during his trial.
Goldberg said his son, who in 1985 was 29 and married with
children, ``needed me to tell him I hadn't left him.''
   ``I told him I didn't see how I could ever make my family above
all other families,'' he says. ``Kids suffer and starve not because
their parents are politically active, but that's the nature of
apartheid, and I felt I had to do something.''
   His eyes reddened with emotion behind horn-rimmed glasses.
   ``I've had some suffering. So! Lots of people have died. People
are getting hanged, people are getting shot. I'm alive. Life's
great.''

<TEXT>
   Opposition members shouted slogans and
walked out of the upper house of Parliament Wednesday after the
house chairman rejected demands that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi
answer allegations in a multimillion dollar arms scandal.
   Gandhi was not present during the uproar in the Rajya Sabha, or
house of the nation, but was heckled by opposition members who
returned when he entered the chamber to announce a new employment
scheme.
   Opposition members waved copies of a newspaper that published
the allegations and demanded Gandhi explain news reports of
kickbacks being paid in the 1986 purchase of artillery from the
Swedish company, AB Bofors.
   Members of Gandhi's Congress Party, who have a 142-100 majority
in the house, shouted back, trying to drown out opposition members
chanting ``Corrupt Rajiv Gandhi, resign, resign.''
   The opposition legislators walked out when the house chairman,
Vice President Shankar Dayal Sharma, said he would permit a
discussion on the newspaper report but would not summon Gandhi.
   They returned 90 minutes later when Gandhi entered to read a
statement on creating 1 million new jobs throughout the country,
and drowned most of his 30-minute speech in continuous
slogan-shouting and catcalls.
   The Hindu, a Madras-based daily, said in a front-page story
Monday that there was new evidence to prove kickbacks were paid in
the $1.4 billion deal to purchase Bofors' howitzer guns.
   Newspapers have alleged that Bofors paid $50 million to clinch
the contract and that some of the money went to senior members of
the government. Gandhi has repeatedly denied the charges.
   The allegations were first made in 1987 but have re-surfaced in
recent months as the usually fractious opposition tries to form a
coalition in an effort to unseat Gandhi in national elections due
by January.
   The opposition's efforts to focus public attention on the issue
have included the resignations of 100 Parliament members from the
542-seat lower house, or Lok Sabha, in August. The resigning
members claimed the Congress Party was using its majority to stifle
discussion on the Bofors gun deal.
   Monday's article in The Hindu said secret portions of a report
by the Swedish National Audit Bureau reveal that at least $31
million were paid to a Panama-based company, whose majority owner
was the Indian agent of Bofors in New Delhi.
   The article said the Indian and Swedish government's appeared to
have colluded in keeping that portion of the report secret and
releasing a ``sanitized'' version.
   The newspaper printed photocopies of what it said were the
withheld portions of the report. Next to the photocopies, The Hindu
reprinted three public comments of Gandhi reiterating that no
Indian had received money from the Swedish company.

   The accident occurred about 300 miles southwest of Tokyo at
about 9 a.m. Wednesday. The men's identities were not released.
   Weather conditions were poor at the time, with limited
visibility, reported Master Sgt. Jake Rodrigues, spokesman for U.S.

   The Downes, based in San Diego, was engaged in exercises with
the U.S. 7th Fleet.
   A statement by military officials said an extensive search was
under way for the missing crewman.
   The military said an investigation had begun.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three men facing charges in the world's
largest cocaine seizure were denied bail Wednesday by a judge who
citied a substantial risk of flight by the three, one of whom is a
professional pilot.
   U.S. Magistrate Volney Brown agreed with prosecutors that James
McTague, 41, of El Paso, Texas; Mauricio Monroy, 36, of Mexico
City; and Hugo Fernando Castillon, 32, of Los Angeles, had no
reason to remain here.
   A separate bail hearing was set for Thursday for Miguel Garcia
Chavez, 34, Los Angeles. Pending indictment, all four men face a
federal complaint of possession of cocaine with intent to
distribute.
   They were arrested in the Sept. 28 seizure of what officials say
was 21 tons of cocaine, which has since been destroyed, and about
$12 million in cash discovered at a warehouse in suburban Sylmar.
It was the largest seizure of cocaine on record.
   One defense attorney tried to close the bail hearing to the news
media and another launched an attack on the chain of custody for
their clients, who had faced state charges before being handed over
to federal authorities.
   ``A lot of local politicians and officials have ridden on the
backs of these defendants to enhance their careers,'' said attorney
Marlene Gertz, representing Castillon and Monroy, the pilot.
   ``There's been lots of publicity, and this publicity has been
very detrimental,'' she said in arguing for a closed hearing.
``This bad publicity will continue unless the press is excluded.
The press has already convicted these defendants.''
   Brown denied the motion without comment, along with a motion by
McTague lawyer Michael Pancer to dismiss the charges because the
change from state to federal custody was ``an unnecessary and
improper delay.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney James Walsh said that with several
agencies involved in the investigation, officials needed time to
sort out the proper jurisdiction for prosecution.
   County prosecutors dropped charges Friday against the four men
so they could face charges in federal court where drug conviction
penalties are stricter.
   Brown set a hearing date of Oct. 24 and a post-indictment
arraignment on Oct. 30 for all four defendants in Los Angeles.
   Also Wednesday, prosecutors gave an account of how much cocaine
was seized at the warehouse.
   Federal agents and local police said the haul from the warehouse
weighed 42,800 pounds, including packaging. They subtracted about
800 pounds for packaging, leaving 21 tons.
   McTague is the brother-in-law of Hector Tapia Anchondo, 38, one
of the alleged leaders of the smuggling operation. Authorities said
McTague also identified the mastermind of the drug ring as Rafael
Munoz of Juarez, Mexico.
   Tapia and Carlos Tapia Ponce, 68, father of Tapia Achondo, were
arrested in Las Vegas on Saturday in connection with the cocaine
find. Munoz remains at large.

   Typhoon Dan pummeled the Philippines
Wednesday with 74 mph winds, killing at least 21 people, injuring
57 and forcing more than 125,000 to flee their homes, officials
said.
   In addition, at least 33 fishermen were missing after Dan
battered Manila and southern areas of Luzon island.
   The storm was heading for Vietnam early Thursday.
   Dan was upgraded from a tropical storm to a typhoon late
Wednesday when its winds increased from 62 mph to 74 mph.
   It left five people dead in the Manila area, four on Marinduque
Island, four in Laguna province, two in Cavite province, three in
Bataan province, two in Pampanga province and one in Quezon
province, rescue officials said.
   Officials said about 126,000 people, especially coastal
residents, were evacuated to churches, schools and relief centers.
   Officials said 13 fishing boats ran aground in Batangas
province, 60 miles south of Manila, and one near the U.S. naval
base at Subic Bay, 50 miles west of here, during the storm.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Lourdes Masing said 14 fishermen were
missing aboard seven boats that disappeared in Subic Bay. Another
10 people were missing after the Simon Peter, a boat used in deep
sea diving, ran aground in Subic, Ms. Masing said.
   Seven people swam safely to shore but rescuers were still
looking for 10 other people.
   In Batangas province, the coast guard said 10 people were
rescued after two fishing boats sank when they collided Tuesday off
Bauan, 50 miles south of Manila. Nine people were missing,
officials said.
   An average of 20 typhoons or tropical storms strike the
Philippines each year.
   Dan, the 16th this year, slammed into Sorsogon province late
Tuesday on the southeastern tip of Luzon. It raced across Luzon,
passing just south of Manila before entering the South China Sea.
   President Corazon Aquino ordered government offices in Manila to
close Wednesday except for essential services and trading was
canceled on the Manila and Makati stock exchanges.
   U.S. Air Force officials at Clark Air Base, north of Manila,
said Dan knocked out 80 percent of the electricity in the camp's
housing area.
   About 95 percent of the Manila area, which has a population of
more than 7 million, was without electricity as strong winds ripped
down power lines.
   Sen. Vicente Paterno called on the government to declare a state
of calamity in the affected areas to prevent profiteering on basic
goods such as rice and cooking oil.
   Philippine Airlines canceled 36 domestic flights and
international service was disrupted.
   At Manila's airport, Dan's winds pushed the Boeing 707 of
visiting Deputy Prime Minister Qais al-Zawawi of Oman into the
DC-10 that brought President Hussain Muhammad Ershad of Bangladesh
here Monday for a four-day visit.

   U.S. officials say they are debriefing members
of the Panamanian military who tried unsuccessfully to overthrow
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and were flown to Miami in fear of
retribution.
   Among the 42 Panamanians that the Bush administration flew to
Miami on Saturday was Capt. Javier Licona, believed to be the
highest-ranking participant in the coup to escape capture, said one
administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Family members of slain coup leader Maj. Moises Giroldi also
were in the group, State Department spokesman Rich Sanders said
Tuesday. He would not confirm whether the group included Giroldi's
widow, Adela Bonilla Giroldi, a key intermediary between U.S.
officials and the coup plotters.
   ``These people definitely have good reason to be out of
Panama,'' Sanders said. ``Noriega's proven willingness to use force
against people, murder people, is a matter of record.'' Giroldi was
shot in the aftermath of the coup, by some accounts at Noriega's
own hand.

   Facing mounting protests and an exodus of young
people, East German Communist officials are showing a growing
willingness to open a dialogue with opposition groups they have in
the past ignored or persecuted.
   It was unclear, however, whether the Communist leadership in
East Berlin shared that willingness or even if talks some local
officials have held with pro-democracy activists were just a tactic
to discourage further unrest.
   A Lutheran Church official in East Berlin, Hans Otto Furian,
said Tuesday that the Communist Party ``must give up its grip on
total power.''
   However, Erich Honecker, the country's 77-year-old die-hard
Communist leader, has indicated he will crush dissent if it

   Drug traffickers claimed responsibility
for the assassination of two employees of a crusading anti-drug
newspaper and threatened to kill its remaining 11 workers in
Medellin if they don't leave.
   A magazine journalist and four other people also were gunned
down Tuesday in Colombia's cocaine trafficking capital.
   The shootings in Medellin followed 13 bombings in three other
Colombian cities late Monday and early Tuesday _ the most serious
rash of attacks since the country's drug lords went to war with the
government nearly two months ago.
   Last month, a car bomb exploded outside the main officies in
Bogota of the 102-year-old El Espectador newspaper, injuring scores
of bystanders and causing extensive damage.
   In a telephone call to El Espectador, a man said a group called
The Extraditables would kill the 11 members of the paper's Medellin
staff if they did not leave the city in three days, an editor at
the paper said. The staff is composed of journalists, secretaries
and administrative workers.
   Drug traffickers have issued statements under the name The
Extraditables. The country's top cocaine barons fear extradition to
the United States, which seeks to put them on trial.

   President Bush has accepted an invitation to
attend a drug summit with the leaders of the world's three largest
coca-producing countries, who pledged all-out war on traffickers
during talks in this desert city.
   The presidents of Bolivia, Colombia and Peru, in a five-hour
meeting Tuesday, invited Bush and European leaders to take part in
the summit, to be held within the next 90 days in Latin America.
   In Washington, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said: ``The president will go.'' He said 90 days was ``within the
time frame we have been considering. It's reasonable.''
   Fitzwater said the United States had no objection to
participation by Europeans and security concerns would not stand in
the way of a summit. Of a planning meeting Nov. 20, he said: ``I'm

   Just as the abortion battle intensifies in the
courts and statehouses, some political observers and population
experts say the issue is bound to become an irrelevant relic,
overtaken by technology.
   They say the ``abortion pill'' in growing use in France
inevitably will reach America, legally or illegally, and forever
change the argument: women who want abortions will have them
without having to visit clinics, possibly without doctors _ and
maybe even without knowing whether they are pregnant.
   To anti-abortion forces, the French pill is a cloud on the
horizon. It comes as the Supreme Court faces another opportunity to
overturn its 1973 decision that legalized abortion and as Florida
legislators meet in the nation's first special session on abortion
since the high court in July gave states additional power to
regulate abortions.
   ``People on either side of the argument are spending a lot of
energy and emotion on a political issue that's going to be
defused,'' says Leonard A. Cole, who teaches in the Science,
Technology and Society Program at Rutgers University in Newark,
N.J. He has looked into the likely political consequences of an
easy-to-use, at-home abortion pill.

   Nostalgia videos _ taped television shows and
even commercials from the 1950s and '60s _ have found an
ever-growing market since Paramount Home Video introduced ``Star
Trek'' on tape in 1985.
   With unit sales for various ``Star Trek'' episodes on tape
approaching 4 million, others in the video business have beamed
aboard.
   Now almost every kind of old program is on tape, from familiar
titles such as ``The Honeymooners,'' ``The Lone Ranger'' and ``I
Love Lucy'' to cult shows like actor Patrick McGoohan's abstract
``The Prisoner.''
   Outfits like Paramount and CBS-Fox Home Video have access to a
wide library of shows.
   Paramount is considering the original ``Mission Impossible,''
``The Untouchables,'' and ``Mannix,'' as well as more recent items
like ``Mork and Mindy.''
   CBS is looking at ``Batman,'' ``Gunsmoke,'' ``Hawaii Five-O''
and ``Rawhide.''
   Arny Schorr, the vice president and general manager of Rhino
Records, says the much-targeted baby boomers seem to be most
willing to part with their money for nostalgia videos.
   ``They're the people who grew up with the stuff, and it brings
back comfortable memories,'' Schorr said. ``Also, if they have very
young children, they know its OK to put `The Lone Ranger' on. They
know nobody is going to get killed and the good guys are going to
win.''
   Rhino's video department is an arm of retrospective specialists
Rhino Records in Los Angeles. It has such titles as ``The Lone
Ranger'' and ``Sgt. Preston of the Yukon'' along with ``Roger
Ramjet,'' the late 1960s cartoon series filled with adult asides,
``Death Valley Days,'' with stars including Ronald Reagan and Clint
Eastwood, and ``Peter Gunn,'' the popular detective series with its
driving Henry Mancini theme song.
   MPI Home Video has tracked the cult favorites, including a
recently discovered batch of ``The Honeymooners'' episodes and
``The Prisoner,'' starring McGoohan as a secret agent who resigned
only to be a captive in a seaside village.
   Both shows, said MPI Vice President Jaffer Ali, are good
examples of what clicks in the nostalgia video market.
   ``Jackie Gleason has been popular for 35 years in `The
Honeymooners,' and its safe to say that 35 years from now, Ralph
Kramden will still be funny,'' he said. ```The Prisoner' was not
very successful in syndication, but it was a huge hit for us. There
was a real following.''
   ``It's almost a new kind of syndication, a video syndication,''
said Ali.
   At the end of October, MPI plans to release five-episode tapes
of the gothic soap opera ``Dark Shadows.''
   Because vampire Barnabas Collins, the show's most popular
character, did not appear until eight months into the series, the
first ``Dark Shadows'' tape will include a special half-hour
sequence outlining plot developments that took place before the
Collins character was introduced.
   ``There is another ingredient, and that is cult status. There
are `Dark Shadows' and `Prisoner' and `Honeymooners' fan clubs,''
said Ali. ``We recognize that as a hard-core base that we can build
on.''
   Most of the nostalgia videos are priced from $10 to $20 for sale
directly to consumers rather than rental stores, and even such
giants as CBS-Fox Home Video have found that television advertising
for mail orders _ or using catalogues _ increases sales for
nostalgia videos.
   Taking even a quirkier step into nostalgia is Video Resources
New York Inc., whose founder Ira Gallen has turned his nostalgia
film collecting and research efforts into six volumes of ``Kid's
Commercials Of The '50s and '60s'' and 18 other volumes on
commercials.
   ``I've been collecting films since I was 16,'' Gallen said.
``There is not a school or museum in the country that has the full
version of the history of TV commercials.'' Gallen said he makes
most of his finds by contacting private collectors, along with the
original producers, directors and writers.
   Among his more recent acquisitions: RCA commercials with the
late Vaughn Monroe; Choo-Choo Charlie chugging along with Good and
Plenty candies; and Hertz putting folks in the driver's seat.

<HEAD>Suddenly, South Africans Take Note of Their Ecology</HEAD>

   Suddenly, the ecology has
become a dominant topic in South Africa.
   In recent weeks, tens of thousands of people nationwide have
signed petitions denouncing industrial threats to the environment
and the country's first ecology-oriented political party has come
into being.
   A host of environmental problems confront South Africa, ranging
from air pollution to water shortages, but two events in particular
have galvanized the public into action.
   First came disclosure of plans by a British-owned company to
mine titanium in the scenic sand dunes around Lake St. Lucia, an
estuary and game reserve northeast of Durban on the Indian Ocean.
James Clarke, environment writer for The Str newspaper in
Johannesburg, describes the area as ``one of the world's most
beautiful and biotically rich places.''
   About 200,000 South Africans have signed petitions opposing the
mining project, and government officials have said they will ask
the company, Richards Bay Minerals, to reassess the environmental
impact of its plans.
   In September, an outcry arose when chemicals leaked into a river
in eastern Transvaal Province from a huge paper mill, killing tens
of thousands of fish and disrupting water supplies for more than
200,000 people.
   Residents in the politically conservative area near Kruger
National Park started their own petition drive, demanding
government action against the Sappi paper company and expressing
``dismay and outrage'' at apparently lax safety measures.
   Within days after the chemical spill in the Crocodile River,
environmentalists met in Johannesburg to form the Ecology Party,
which has adopted a green heart as its symbol.
   Colin Slater, a marketing consultant who helped found the party,
said he had lived in West Germany during the emergence of the
Greens movement and hoped the Ecology Party could play a similar
role in forcing South African politicians to pay more attention to
ecological issues.
   In the past, most environmental organizations in South Africa
focused on singular issues. Several groups have promoted wildlife
conservation, for example, and others opposed the use of nuclear
power by the state-run electricity monopoly. But environmental
awareness among the general public was relatively low.
   One reason was that South Africans aligned against the
government and big business concentrated on fighting apartheid.
   ``Resistance and opposition to the government and industry have
been dominated by the burning issues of racism and exploitation,
leaving little time and energy for organization around ecology,''
wrote labor specialists Eddie Koch and Dirk Hartford recently in
The Weekly Mail, an anti-apartheid newspaper.
   But Koch and Hartford suggested that ecologists and
anti-apartheid activists could find common ground in opposing
pollution, the misuse of pesticides and the dumping of toxic
wastes. Other commentators have suggested that the black majority
would take a much keener interest in the environment if whites, who
control 87 percent of South Africa's territory, agreed to a major
redistribution of land.
   The Ecology Party's Slater said the environment has suffered
neglect because of ``the tremendous day-to-day emphasis on
black-white politics.''
   ``But we feel that hopefully the black-white political problem
is reaching a resolution,'' he said in an interview. ``When blacks
and whites are finally holding hands, let's make sure it's not in a
desert.''
   The National Party government, in power since 1948, is viewed by
many environmentalists as a halfhearted ally, committed in
principal to environmental protection but often reluctant to act,
possibly because industrial growth is needed to provide jobs for
the fast-growing black population.
   Peter Glavovic, an environmental law expert at the University of
Natal, says the government has steered away from tough
anti-pollution laws, instead giving its environment minister broad
discretionary powers.
   ``South Africa is in many respects still a developing country,''
Glavovic said. ``The government clearly doesn't want to
overregulate or curtail operations so that this starts impacting on
economic growth.''
   The environment is the topic of a new book by Clem Sunter, a
corporate consultant who specializes in forecasting what lies ahead
for South Africa.
   The book, ``South African Environments into the 21st Century,''
says droughts, floods, locust plagues, sandstorms and fires in
South Africa during the 1980s were aggravated by shoddy
conservation practices.
   South Africa ``had to pay the price for over a century of
careless environmental management and its unique experiment in
social engineering (apartheid),'' Sunter writes.
   He argues that the environment will be saved only through a
combination of sustained economic growth, curtailment of the birth
rate and political stability.
   ``People must be educated about the importance of safeguarding
the interests of future generations by protecting the environment
today,'' he writes. ``Wiping the slate clean of apartheid is one
thing ... but what replaces it is even more important.''

<HEAD>Ousting Noriega Would be a Tricky Enterprise</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever the odds on Manuel Noriega's lease on
power in Panama, they have to be heavily against the kind of tidy,
tied-down coup the administration seems to envision as a way to get
rid of him.
   After the coup that failed, Congress sounds more willing than
the administration to take risks _ or at least to encourage
President Bush to take them _ provided they pay off in the ouster
of the Panamanian military boss.
   But stripping a strongman of his power is a risky enterprise,
with no guarantees. It does not lend itself to scripts written in
Washington for execution without peril to American forces and
interests.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the administration
would want better conditions and a better atmosphere in order to
commit American forces to a future move against Noriega.
   Baker said the message sent to U.S. commanders at the time of
the Oct. 3 coup attempt was to go ahead with support ``if there
were an opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and
significant loss of American life and to do so without open
military involvement ...''
   In congressional debate about what went wrong and who's to blame
there has little talk about the risks involved in promoting or
aiding an attempt to topple Noriega by force, and then arrest him
on two U.S. drug trafficking indictments.
   Noriega has withstood 2{ years of U.S. efforts, under two
administrations, to push him out with economic and diplomatic
sanctions. An earlier coup attempt was crushed, as was the attempt
of a Panamanian president to dismiss him. He cancelled the results
of an election after it had been held because it was going against
him. Sanctions were stiffened and reinforcements sent to the
12,000-man U.S. garrison in Panama. The Organization of American
States tried to negotiate the peaceful transfer of power to a
democratic government, without success.
   So much for persuasion. That leaves force.
   Intervention in support of the coup attempted by dissident
members of the Panama Defense Forces could have led to U.S.
casualties. Baker argues that American lives should not be put at
risk on the basis of ``somebody else's plan and somebody else's
schedule.''
   Then again, a coup attempt based on a U.S. plan and timetable
would have built-in liabilities. Noriega already claims his
opponents are Yankee lackeys bent on helping the United States hold
onto the Panama Canal. Open intervention would stir trouble
elsewhere in Latin America and could strengthen opponents of U.S.
bases elsewhere.
   Although the White House is reviewing the way it is set up to
gather information and make decisions in times of crisis, Bush's
spokesman said that is because of concern about the process, not
because of second thoughts about using U.S. forces in support of
the coup attempt.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said baloney to the
suggestion that Bush didn't get the information he needed on which
to base a decision.
   ``He made the decision he thought was best and the decision we
still think is right,'' Fitzwater said Tuesday.
   Nor, he said, is there any change in the administration's policy
of encouraging the Panamanians to oust Noriega, despite the critics
who say that carried with it some obligation to help rebellious
officers who tried to do the job.
   Bush has suggested repeatedly that the Panama Defense Forces get
rid of the general, saying the United States has no quarrel with
the organization, only with Noriega and his cadre. He repeated that
message the day after the aborted coup.
   ``And we'll continue to speak out in that area,'' Fitzwater said.
   Administration officials have been doing so.
   John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said in a
Saturday interview on Cable News Network that he thinks Noriega
will be ousted within six months. ``If you want odds, I'd say 8 to
5 that he probably will be out,'' Sununu said.
   Baker wasn't quoting odds, but he said the pressure will stay
on. ``And we're not going to rule out the use of force, either
force that we ourselves plan totally and directly or force in
conjunction with some other operation,'' Baker said Sunday on NBC's
Meet the Press.
   Administration spokesmen fanned out to the network talk shows as
Bush was criticized from both the right and the left for failing to
order U.S. military action in support of the coup.
   The Senate approved a measure expressing support for efforts by
the president to ``use the full range of appropriate diplomatic,
economic and military options'' to protect Americans, guard the
canal, remove Noriega and restore constitutional government.
   Republicans complained that some Democrats who had opposed
intervention in other crises were retroactively endorsing it in the
Panama coup.
   ``Failure is the father of about a hundred hawks on Capitol Hill
now,'' said Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine.

   ``Time is money.''
   Though that proverb dates to ancient history, repeated over the
centuries by sages like Benjamin Franklin and Charles Dickens, it
is by no means worn out.
   In fact, in an era of two-income families, convenience stores,
fax machines and microwave ovens, it has taken on new relevance as
one of the most common, and important, principles people apply to
the business of their daily lives.
   A ``service economy'' like that of the United States today
provides more and more situations in which you can, or must,
exchange one of those valued commodities for the other.
   So the questions naturally arise: How much is your time worth in
dollars? And, by no means incidentally, how much are your dollars
worth in time?
   For most people who work for wages or salaries, one quick answer
to that question is available from the stub on your last paycheck:
$5 an hour, or $10, or $50, or $500. Perhaps overtime gets you
time-and-a-half, or 50 percent more.
   Similarly, anyone with a hand-held calculator can estimate the
``time value'' of his or her money. If you invest $3,650 at a 10
percent yield in a one-year certificate of deposit, the bank pays
you about about $1 a day for the use of your money.
   But the reckoning gets more complicated once you start to deal
with problems involving more variables that are harder to quantify.
   For example, what is the net income your household realizes from
a second job that requires extra expenses for day care,
transportation and convenience foods? How much return per hour do
you actually get from clipping and filing supermarket coupons?
   And how high must the hourly labor rate charged by a plumber or
electrician go before it behooves you to take on the labors, and
risks, of home repairs yourself?
   Often, of course, necessity makes the decision for you. If you
lack the money, you find the time somehow. If an urgent mission is
beyond your time and skills, you endeavor to scrape up the money
somewhere.
   Still, even in cases like these, there can be tradeoffs
involved. Suppose you have a household problem for which you must
hire a contractor.
   By the traditional wisdom, notes John T. Reed in his newsletter
Real Estate Investor's Monthly, you should get estimates from at
least three contractors before you hire one for the job. To get the
best possible price, you might even call in every contractor in
your area.
   The more exhaustive your selection process, though, the more
time you are likely to spend trying to save money.
   Cases like this give you an opportunity to perform an
instructive exercise. If you keep track of the money saved and the
time spent on a given project, you can simply divide the dollar
amount of savings by the number of hours you put in.
   The result of that one-step calculation gives you the value in
dollars per hour you have set for yourself on your time.
   Conversely, if you pay someone else to tackle something you
might have done yourself, you can divide the extra expense by your
estimate of how many hours of work you saved. That tells you how
much money you are willing to spend in exchange for an hour of your
time.

<TEXT>
   If you examine an economist carefully, you
generally will find an individual who believes inflation is one of
the great threats to mankind _ not just to man's economy, but to
his existence.
   They have good reasons for the feeling, because inflation not
only corrupts the currency but eventually erodes quality, morality,
ambition, contracts, values and responsibilities at individual,
group and governmental levels.
   Still, not all economists put inflation at the top of their
lists of things to avoid. There is another group that says constant
worry and maneuvering to avoid inflation can produce equal or worse
consequences.
   Those two groups are now fighting it out, and it could be a
slugfest. In one group is a White House that sees economic growth
as a more important goal than inflation fighting. In the other is
the Federal Reserve.
   They aren't likely to identify themselves as opponents, because
conflict tends to cause too much excitement in the marketplace, but
the scrap will be hard to disguise. These are two heavyweights.
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, had made clear his position
that inflation is the bigger threat, and his actions suggest that
he is even willing to incur a mild recession in order to keep it
submerged.
   Greenspan hasn't just recently joined the anti-inflation group.
Back in the mid-1970s he chaired an anti-inflation commission for
President Ford that campaigned on the WIN ticket _ Whip Inflation
Now.
   Critics forgive him for that, because double-digit inflation was
a scourge of the 1970s, rising to double-digit levels that, while
making some people rich, disrupted markets, threatened banking
stability and destroyed savings.
   Greenspan's timing was less forgivable, since the WIN campaign
was launched while the nation's economy was about to plunge into a
recession, which for limited practical purposes can be called the
opposite of inflation.
   Ever since becoming Federal Reserve chairman in the Reagan
administration, Greenspan has continued to signal his fear of
inflation. While many economists celebrated inflation of less than
5 percent, Greenspan said it wasn't enough.
   In July 1988, when some economists were discussing the economy's
slow growth, Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee that
unemployment was nearing its lower limit and industrial capacity
its upper limit.
   When those limits are reached, a true inflation fighter knows
that interest rates must be raised. Greenspan saw to it, and over
the next four months the Federal Funds rate increased a full
percentage point to 8.5 percent.
   Whether Greenspan saved the economy from inflation will be
debated forever; more important was the perception that he viewed
the economy as too hot when some of his brother economists thought
it was somewhat cool.
   Rather than raising interest rates, some of these colleagues
argued, shouldn't the country seek to expand its capacity? Expanded
capacity, new equipment and more efficient plants also could remove
an inflation threat.
   Edward Yardeni, Prudential-Bache economics director, expressed
the latter view late in 1988. If Greenspan tightened too much, he
said, he could abort the capital spending needed ``to expand
capacity he fears there isn't enough of.''
   This week, Greenspan seemed to issue another warning, advising
people not to expect easier money in the interest of expanding the
economy. He said in effect that the bigger threat is still
inflation rather than recession.

<HEAD>Negotiating Pastors Challenging Methodist Tradition of Itineracy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Lester Meyer remembers the phone call he received one
Saturday from another pastor wondering when Meyer and his family
were going to move out so he could move in.
   The other minister was embarrassed to learn Meyer had no idea he
had been transferred, but a generation ago it was not unusual for
the bishop to order a pastor to pull up stakes within a few days
and move to another outpost in the United Methodist Church.
   Now a member of the hierarchy himself, Meyer finds the
centuries-old tradition of the itineracy _ in which ministers are
guaranteed jobs for life in return for going where they are sent _
under challenge from clergy who no longer can or want to uproot
their families to serve a small, rural church or a poor urban
church.
   ``Formally, they still take the same vow. Practically speaking,
there is a different philosophy,'' said Meyer, district
superintendent of the Oklahoma City North District, part of the
United Methodists' Oklahoma Conference. ``The autocratic assignment
process simply would not work in the present social times.''
   The 9 million-member church that once operated on the principle
that ``a pastor always has a church, a church always has a pastor''
has had to adjust to the advent of clergy couples and working
spouses and to theological changes stressing the partnership of
bishops and clergy.
   The future of the itineracy is being weighed by a Commission for
the Study of Ministry. It began work in 1984 and expects to produce
a preliminary report early next year. The final report is to be
presented before the 1992 General Conference, the church's chief
policy-making body.
   The issue is not unique to the United Methodist Church.
   In the Roman Catholic Church, bishops have been consulting more
frequently with priests and parishes on clergy assignments in the
last 20 years, said the Rev. David Brinkmoeller, executive director
of the Secretariat for Priestly Life and Ministry of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops.
   ``It's a theological conviction'' that everyone has some
understanding of God's will, not just the bishops, Brinkmoeller
said.
   United Methodist Bishop Bruce Blake of Dallas, vice-chairman of
the Commission on Ministry, said the hierarchical ministry is being
phased out in many churches.
   ``I think what is happening in the itineracy is sort of symbolic
of what's happening in the church in general,'' Blake said.
``Collegiality, throughout the church, is replacing hierarchy and
competition.''
   In addition, pastors and their families have more at stake today
when considering a move.
   The ordination of women, for example, has produced the
corresponding phenomenon of clergy couples. There are about 600
clergy couples among the more than 38,000 ordained ministers in the
United Methodist Church.
   The rise in two-income families also has decreased mobility as
spouses veto moves too far from present jobs. Meyer estimates 80
percent of the clergy in his area have working spouses.
   But Brinkmoeller says ``the rub in the system'' of greater
consultation on personnel moves is that few changes are currently
possible; jobs in inner cities and remote areas still must be
filled.
   Some Episcopal bishops, in a recent ``Excellence in Ministry''
report for the church, ``commented sardonically that there was no
job shortage in some of the less attractive jobs in remote areas
and the inner cities.''
   Some within the United Methodist Church are concerned that
giving clergy veto power over jobs would make it more difficult to
fill less attractive positions, while the large, well-off churches
could shop around for the best and the brightest clergy. Nearly
two-thirds of United Methodist congregations have fewer than 200
members.
   What happens in practice, Meyer said, is that ``lesser
qualified'' clergy are sometimes appointed to rural churches.
   Blake said there is a tension within clergy between their call
to be in ministry and ``careerism,'' which he defined as a ``gross
national product'' understanding of vocation that equates bigger
with better.
   In Britain, Methodists have dealt with the issue by
standardizing clergy salaries. Proposals to do the same in the
United States have consistently been defeated, but Blake said the
issue will not go away.
   ``That is on the table. We must resolve it,'' Blake said. ``If
the guiding principle of one's ministry is one's career, that is
not theologically or ecclessiastically defensible.''

   AB Volvo said it is holding discussions
with France's Renault, although it would not confirm published
reports that the automakers were in final negotiations for a merger
or joint venture.
   The business magazine Veckans Affarer, in its Wednesday edition,
said it had confirmation from sources at Volvo, Renault and the
Swedish government of the merger talks.
   ``We are conducting talks about cooperation with Renault, but I
don't want to comment on their content, on which level the talks
are being held and the possible timing,'' Krister Goransson,
Volvo's information director, said Tuesday.
   Thomas Clifford, a spokesman for Volvo in New York, said the
company had confirmed that Volvo was talking with Renault and with
Spain's Empresa Nacional de Autocamiones SA, although he had no
further information about the topic of discussion.
   Renault's information chief, Olivier Cochet, confirmed in Paris
to the Swedish news agency TT that negotiations were taking place
between the French government-owned carmaker and Volvo.
   ``Renault aims to break its isolation before 1992 and is looking
for a partner to bring costs down,'' TT quoted Cochet as saying.
   But the talks with Volvo were similar to talks Renault was
having with other automaking concerns, Cochet told the Swedish
agency.
   The new concern would have 250,000 employees and revenue of
about $39 billion, Veckans Affarer stated.
   Volvo has been seeking to safeguard its position in Europe once
the European Economic Community establishes open borders in 1992,
because Sweden has said it would not ask to join the community.
   Volvo is by far Scandinavia's largest company in the private
sector, reporting a pre-tax profit last year of $1.3 billion.
   Aside from cars, trucks and buses, Volvo has diversified into
food, marine and industrial motors, aerospace and trading. Volvo is
the general agent for Renault cars and light trucks in Sweden.
   Volvo spokesman Hans Rehnstrom told The Associated Press the
talks with Renault were not initiated because of 1992.
   He said the main concern ``is structural issues...Volvo is a
small producer in the big world.''
   Rehnstrom said Volvo needs a broader range of products and cars,
adding to its current series of big cars aimed at high-income
buyers.

<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it will
evaluate heat-sensitive food packaging materials designed for
microwave cooking to determine whether new safety regulations are
needed.
   The FDA is asking for information about heat susceptors,
metalized surfaces in the packages of food intended for microwave
cooking. These heat susceptors absorb microwave energy and become
very hot, allowing the food to become brown and crisp.
   Because the susceptors become so hot, the FDA said Tuesday it is
concerned that other parts of the package, including adhesives,
polymers, paper and components of plastic films, may migrate into
the food at high levels.
   The FDA has regulations governing the safety of packaging
materials that contain substances that could migrate into food, but
the agency said that at the time many of the rules were written
these materials were not commonly used at temperatures above 300
degrees Fahrenheit.
   Heat-susceptor packaging can raise the temperature to more than
500 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The FDA said it does not have enough data to determine whether
at these high temperatures the packaging materials are safe. It is
asking the industry and the scientific community to submit
information the agency can use to consider amending the regulations
for food packaging.

   Integrated Resources Inc., a struggling
financial concern, was dealt another blow when Whitehall Financial
Group said it could not obtain financing to buy Integrated's core
financial services businesses.
   Integrated also said Tuesday that Whitehall was seeking a
``significant adjustment'' in the $310 million purchase price and
proposed to pay for the business partly with securities in the new
core group.
   The snag raises further doubts about Integrated's ability to
make payments on some $1.75 billion in debt. Integrated has not
paid any principle or interest to bondholders since June, when it
said it would have to default because of worsening troubles
stemming from its difficulty in diversifying out of real estate
into financial services businesses.
   Whitehall, a family-owned partnership, had reached a tentative
agreement in August to buy Integrated Resources Life Insurance Co.,
Integrated Resources Equity Corp., Integrated Resources Asset
Management Corp., Resources Trust Co., and Financial Clearing and
Services Corp.
   After the spinoff of subsidiaries, Integrated's main business
would be management of existing public and private limited
partnerships and real estate investment trusts.
   Integrated, once a high-flying real estate investment concern,
said it was continuing negotiations with Whitehall and ``is also
engaged in serious discussions with another party.''
   Integrated said it still wants to reach an agreement to sell the
core businesses by Sunday.
   Integrated had said it would try to sell its core financial
service companies for $450 million to $525 million, but Whitehall
was interested in only part of the holdings. The $310 million price
was put at $20 million to $30 million below the low end of the
desired price for the financial businesses.
   Integrated also said it had agreed to pay Whitehall a $4 million
breakup fee of the deal was dropped.
   Whitehall is half-owned by members of the de Gunzburg branch of
the Bronfman family of Canada, heirs to the Seagram Ltd. distilling
fortune, and half-owned by the Moross family of London, which has
extensive financial services interests. Whitehall has holdings in
life insurance and property and casualty brokerage.
   Under the deal, Whitehall would not buy Integrated's Capitol
Life Insurance Co., its tax-sheltered annuity business, its
ordinary life insurance business or United Resources.

   A Washington lawyer who advised a British

been arrested on British charges of theft, according to The
Washington Post.
   The lawyer, Thomas J. Ward, was released and will face
extradition proceedings soon, according to the newspaper's account

   The newspaper said a spokesman for the Justice Department
confirmed the arrest by U.S. marshal's last week, though the U.S.
attorney's office declined to comment.

   Ward's lawyer, David Aufhauser, was out of town, said a woman
who answered the telephone at his home.
   The British theft charge concerns a payment of $8 million Ward
received from Guinness PLC after Guinness succeeded in taking over
Distillers Co. in 1986, the newspaper said.
   Former Guinness Chairman Ernest Saunders and several other
people are expected to go to trial soon in Britain on charges
arising from their roles in alleged stock market manipulation that

<HEAD>Britain Suddenly Finds Itself in an Economic Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain suddenly has found itself in an economic
crisis, with high inflation, high interest rates and a growing
trade deficit returning despite the 10-year Thatcher revolution.
   A recent move by the government to hike interest rates to 15
percent, the highest level in eight years, might plunge Britain
into a recession, the government's critics warn.
   The pound is falling sharply despite the interest rate increase,
and stock prices are sinking on the prospect of yet another rate
hike.
   ``There's no doubt about it. We are in a crisis,'' said Simon
Knapp, a British economist at the London investment firm Barclays
de Zoete Wedd Ltd. ``You're talking about the possibility of the
U.K. going into a recession. That hasn't happened since 1981-1982.''
   Said David Webb, a lecturer on economics at the London School of
Economics: ``It is quite a serious problem. The economy is going to
have to take some pretty harsh medicine over the next few months.''
   Among the victims are homeowners, who have seen mortgage
payments rise steadily through 11 official interest rate hikes over
the past 17 months.
   The government insists the problems arise from success, not
failure _ that the inflation now running at an annual rate of 7.3
percent stems from an economy that grew too fast in the boom years
of Thatcherism.
   It points out that inflation and interest rates are still below
those it inherited when Margaret Thatcher took office as prime
minister in 1979.
   But the crisis has put Mrs. Thatcher's Conservative Party on the
defense in the midst of its annual convention this week. An agenda
that was supposed to dwell on the triumphs of Thatcherism is now
likely to be dominated by the economic problems.
   Meanwhile, the opposition Labor Party is looking like a credible
alternative for the first time in years. It's ahead in the polls,
has formally dumped many of its old vote-losing policies, and is
looking with increasing confidence toward mid-1992, the deadline
for Britain's next general election.
   Despite the current troubles, the Thatcher government maintains
that fighting inflation is its priority, and high interest rates
the weapon, no matter how unpopular.
   Mrs. Thatcher told party members at a pre-conference dinner
Monday night: ``The economy is stronger than ever The interest rate
rise was necessary and this government always does what is
necessary and always has.''
   Just months ago, the government was credited with curing
Britain's long-term economic disease of high inflation and high
interest rates.
   It boasted of the longest period of economic growth since World
War II, fiscal prudence, and a long-declining unemployment rate,
now at 6.1 percent. Nigel Lawson, who slashed income tax rates, was
being hailed as one of Britain's greatest-ever chancellors of the
exchequer, the government's chief fiscal officer.
   So what went wrong?
   ``Basically, the chancellor let the economy grow too strongly
for too long,'' Knapp said.
   Lawson, fearful of recession, allowed interest rates to stay too
low after the October 1987 stock market crash, the economist said.
Instead, consumer spending and investment, already strong, grew
further, spurring inflation, the economist said.
   Britain's industry warns that its profits, jobs and
competitiveness abroad are in danger.
   Weak sterling can be inflationary, and the government has
defended the pound through higher interest rates and central bank
intervention.
   But the pound has continued to fall, dropping below the key
psychological barrier of 3 West German marks on Monday. That could
mean yet another hike in interest rates.
   Late Tuesday, the pound was down 3 pfennigs and two cents from
Monday, at 2.95 marks and $1.5580.
   The stock market has declined sharply on the prospect of higher
interest rates. The Financial Times-100 share index closed at
2,218.8 Tuesday, down 4 percent from last Wednesday, the day before
the most recent interest rate hike.
   The latest troubles began Sept. 26, when the pound was hit by
the announcement of a $3 billion current account deficit for
August, its third worst on record. The trade measure is expected to
more than double to $24 billion this year.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. has boosted
its per-share offer for LIN Broadcasting Corp. but said it would be
happy with simple control of the cellular-phone company rather than
an outright purchase.
   The announcement Tuesday was the latest twist in a takeover
attempt that began in early June.
   McCaw, based in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, said it would
pay $125 a share in cash for 22 million of LIN's approximately 54
million outstanding shares, or a total of $2.75 billion.
   In June, McCaw offered $120 a share for the 90 percent of LIN
stock it does not already own, then lowered its bid in July to $110
a share after a court ruling it said lowered the value of New
York-based LIN.
   But analysts predicted that under terms of the new offer, McCaw
would still wind up with full ownership of LIN in five years.
   Combined with nearly 5.1 million LIN shares it already owns, the
latest offer would immediately give McCaw, the nation's largest
cellular phone operator, slightly more than 50 percent of LIN.
   And Tuesday's bid said McCaw would guarantee LIN's remaining
shares would be exchanged in five years for a price to be
determined by the LIN board and the company's investment bankers,
or that the entire company would be sold at that time at auction.
   Analysts said that provision almost certainly means McCaw would
achieve full ownership of LIN at that time.
   ``We'll be reviewing it (McCaw's new offer) and making a public
statement at some future date,'' said Mike Plouf, LIN's vice
president of corporate development and treasurer. Beyond that, he
said, the company had no comment.
   The deal values all of LIN, which owns seven television
stations, cellular telephone properties and a small publishing
operation, at about $6.75 billion.
   ``This is almost back to where they were before (in the June
offer), ... so from a valuation standpoint it's virtually unchanged
_ about $290 per `pop,''' said Geoffrey Johnson, a
telecommunications analyst for Argus Research Corp.
   A pop is an industry yardstick obtained by multiplying a
market-area population by the percentage ownership of cellular
systems serving the market.
   ``Really, what they're doing is appeasing institutional
investors who don't want to give up LIN,'' Johnson said.
   Trouble financing a full takeover might also have prompted the
decision to tone down the offer, said Alfred Humphries, director of
research and a cellular analyst for the Denver investment firm
Hanifen, Imhoff Inc., who noted an offer for the whole company
would involve about $6 billion in debt.
   McCaw said in a statement it anticipated no trouble raising the
needed capital without a public debt offering, although it said
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., its investment backer, was ``highly
confident'' if could raise $2.5 billion with an offering if needed.
   ``We are determined to complete the acquisition of LIN in order
to provide a vital link in the creation of a seamless, nationwide
cellular network,'' said Craig O. McCaw, the company's chairman and
chief executive officer.
   McCaw has been repeatedly rejected by LIN.
   The companies said in July they were talking about a merger
agreement at $127.50 a share, but they could not agree on the
timing of the deal and the talks broke off.
   Last month, LIN announced it intended to merge with the domestic
cellular telephone interests of BellSouth Corp., the regional
telephone company in Atanta.
   Tuesday's move by McCaw left analysts speculating about
BellSouth's response. Its offer was valued at about $105 per share,
only $20 of which was cash.
   ``It's hard to say what a logical reply for them would be,''
Humphries said. ``They could put more cash into the pot and thereby
raise the dividend payment. They could try a number of devices, but
there's not an easy way.''
   Last week, McCaw said it was buying a half-interest in Metro
One, a cellular franchise in New York City whose other half is
owned by LIN. McCaw said it was paying $1.9 billion for the
interest, which is now owned by Metromedia Co.
   LIN has a 45-day right to match the McCaw offer for the Metro
One stake.
   McCaw said Tuesday that after the completion of its tender offer
for LIN's shares, it would sell its interest in Metro One to LIN.
   McCaw also said last week it would sell its interests in 13
mobile-telephone franchises in Alabama, Kentucky and Tennessee to
Contel Cellular Inc. for $1.3 billion _ cash that could be used in
the bids for LIN and Metro One.

<HEAD>ALPA Votes To Continue Strike Payments to Eastern Pilots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Air Line Pilots Association gave
striking Eastern Airlines pilots a bracing morale boost by voting
to continue special payments to the Eastern strikers.
   ALPA, which represents pilots at nearly all the nation's major
carriers, announced late Tuesday that a majority of its members
voted to maintain the strike benefits for Eastern pilots. ALPA
declined to reveal the vote tally, saying only that a simple
majority of the returned ballots was needed to continue the
payments for six months.
   The announcement gave a lift to the 2,400 or so Eastern pilots
in their eighth month of a walkout, after numerous setbacks in
their fight against Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp. Pilot leaders had warned that if ALPA abandoned the
Eastern pilots, the national union's bargaining position with all
the carriers would have been weakened.
   When the strike against Miami-based Eastern began March 4, there
were about 3,600 pilots at the airline. Their ranks have thinned
since as financial pressures have forced scores back across the
picket lines and others have retired or found jobs at other
carriers.
   Ron Cole, a spokesman for the striking pilots, said the ALPA
vote will bolster people still on the picket lines.
   ``It wasn't unexpected, because professional pilots understand
that the outcome of the Eastern strike will have a direct bearing
on their own futures,'' he said. ``I think it gives them a show of
support from their fellow pilots and will help continue their
strong resolve.''
   The 40,000 or so ALPA members were asked to vote last month on
whether they wished to keep paying about 3 percent of their salary
to their colleagues at Eastern, which is trying to emerge from
bankruptcy protection as a smaller carrier. ALPA declined to say
how many pilots voted.
   The benefits to Eastern pilots averaged about $2,400 a month per
flier since the walkout began.
   The pilots were a crucial element of support in the strike that
started with Eastern's Machinists union, which also was joined by
the airline's flight attendants.
   ``It's a tremendous morale boost,'' Eastern Machinists leader
Charles Bryan said in a telephone interview from Miami. ``It will
certainly give our people a boost to know that ALPA supports their
strike that strongly.''
   Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said the airline had no
comment on the matter.
   Later this week the Senate could vote on a bill, supported by
the Eastern unions, to set up a blue-ribbon commission that would
investigate the Eastern dispute. In a vote last week, the Senate
decided to cut off debate on the bill.
   But the White House and the Transportation Department have
lobbied heavily against the bill, and President Bush is likely to
veto it. In that case, if Congress couldn't muster the votes to
override his veto, the pilots could suffer a blow to morale.

<HEAD>P&amp;G Chairman To Step Down, Sparking Top-Level Changes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Procter &amp; Gamble Co., one of the nation's
largest consumer products companies, will head into the 1990s
looking to increase its overseas sales under a new top executive.
   The Cincinnati-based company will get a new chairman and chief
executive officer Jan. 2 when Edwin L. Artzt takes over for John G.
Smale, the company's leader for the last nine years.
   Smale, 62, surprised shareholders at their annual meeting
Tuesday by announcing he will stepping down to spend more time with
his family. That set in motion of series of top-level shifts that
will leave Artzt head of the diversified company, which had more
than $21 billion in worldwide sales last year.
   Artzt, 59, has been vice chairman of the board and president of
Procter &amp; Gamble International since 1984. His first major
promotion came in 1969, when he was named vice president of the
food products division.
   In another move, company President John E. Pepper will give up
most of his responsibilities for P&amp;G's domestic operations to
oversee the international business.
   During his tenure, Smale helped the company branch out into
foreign markets. Roughly 39 percent of its sales in the last fiscal
year came from outside the United States, and Smale said the figure
should top 50 percent in a few years.
   ``Procter &amp; Gamble is well along the way towards changing from
being a United States-based business that sells some of its
products in international markets to being a truly world company,''
Smale said.
   Smale also led the company into new product lines and oversaw an
$805 million reorganization two years ago aimed at streamlining
management. Under his leadership, the company acquired
Richardson-Vicks, the Noxell Corp. and some major brands from G.D.
Searle. Those moves gave the company a wide base in
over-the-counter drugs and beauty products.
   P&amp;G had sales of $21.4 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30,
earnings of $1.6 billion and dividends of $3 per common share _ all
company records.
   Smale cited personal reasons for deciding to give up his
executive position Jan. 2. He said he will remain an employee and
will serve as a director and as chairman of the board's executive
committee.
   ``By January, I will have been president and then chairman of
Procter &amp; Gamble for nearly 16 years,'' he said. ``I will have been
the chief executive officer of the company for nine years. I've
reached the conclusion that for me as well as for my family it's
time to turn this responsibility over to someone else.''
   In other personnel moves, P&amp;G announced that:
   _B. Jurgen Hintz, a group vice president, was elected an
executive vice president. He will be responsible for the company's
domestic paper products, cellulose and chemicals, and food and
beverage businesses.
   _Durk I. Jager, a group vice president, was chosen an executive
vice president. He will be responsible for domestic soap, detergent
and health and beauty care businesses.
   _Gerald V. Dirvin, senior vice president, becomes an executive
vice president. He will continue to oversee most of P&amp;G's staff
functions, such as sales, advertising, marketing services and
public affairs.
   Smale announced the sweeping changes at a shareholders meeting
punctuated by an animal-rights demonstration. Several dozen
activists picketed outside the company's headquarters while others
questioned Smale during the meeting about P&amp;G's continued use of
animals for product-safety testing.
   Smale repeated the company's position that marketing certain
products without animal testing would be unsafe.
   ``Animal tests are used only when no other acceptable methods
are available,'' he said.
   Animal-rights activists, who have targeted P&amp;G in recent years,
have failed to gain approval at recent shareholder meetings for
proposals to stop the use of animals in product testing.
   Smale declined to say how many animals are being used for such
purposes. He did say the company reduced the number of animals it
uses by one-third in the past five years and will continue to look
for alternatives.
   In other matters, shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split
effective Oct. 20, and increased the authorized number of common
shares from 500 million to 1 billion.

<HEAD>Fed Chairman Says Soviets Pragmatic, Not in Panic</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board, says Soviet economists appear largely unfettered by
ideology as they search for ways out of the country's financial
woes.
   In a meeting Tuesday that would have been unthinkable just a few
years ago, Greenspan held discussions with nine of the top economic
minds of a system that has been at the opposite end of the
philosophical spectrum for decades.
   He told a news conference the Soviets are ``willing to reach
beyond the usual confines of what economic policy-makers are
willing to do.''
   ``They are broadening their view to see whether there are
applicable views outside their immediate circle,'' Greenspan said.
   ``Did we get into an ideological debate over values? No,'' he
said.
   Greenspan said he was not able to offer specific suggestions to
many Soviet economic problems because of his lack of detailed
knowledge of its system. But he did discuss such issues as reform
and convertibility of the Soviet ruble.
   The decades of ideological differences resulted in an initial
sense of akwardness. ``If I didn't feel odd, I must say, I would be
peculiar,'' Greenspan said. But the Soviets' non-ideological
approach dissipated the sense of uncertainty, he said.
   Greenspan, who was chairman of the President's Council of
Economic Advisers under President Gerald Ford and also headed a
commission on social security reform, met with Finance Minister
Valentin Pavlov, Deputy Premier Leonid Abalkin, and other top
officials and economic theorists.
   Those officials are trying to right an economy struggling with a
huge budget deficit, bare store shelves, increasing consumer fears
of even worse conditions, strikes, and a near-worthless currency.
   Despite their troubles, Greenspan said there is no sense of
crisis among the Soviet economists.
   In their meetings, Greenspan said the Soviets sought information
on the Western approach to solving individual economic problems.
But they will not try to superimpose capitalism on their own
system, he said.
   The nited States can help by providing economic expertise on
particular issues, but discussion of U.S. economic aid, as some
Soviet officials have suggested, was not on the agenda, he said.
   ``What they have basically is an understanding that they have to
restructure and that the issue of success is theirs,'' Greenspan
said.
   Greenspan also turned his attention to exchange rates in the
world market in a speech for delivery later to U.S. and Soviet
officials at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Moscow.
   In an advanced text released in Washington, Greenspan said that
``attempts to maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to
destabilizing international capital flows, and ultimately have to
be abandoned.''
   He said that paying inordinate attention to intermediate targets
in setting monetary policy ``may not promote the attainment of
long-term goals.''
   Greenspan made his remarks as the Federal Reserve Board finds
itself under pressure from the Bush administration to take action
to bring the dollar down from its steep rise against foreign
currencies this year.
   The fed also is being urged by some administration officials to
ease its grip on credit to steer the economy clear of recession.

<HEAD>Nine Companies Form CFC Clearinghouse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nine major companies say they are forming a
clearinghouse to promote cooperation among themselves and others in
ending use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, as cleaning agents.
   Some of the companies who made the announcement Tuesday had made
clear previously their intention of seeking substitutes for CFCs.
   CFCs are used widely as refrigeration fluids in air conditioners
and refrigerators as well in as cleaning solvents for metals and
electronic components. They escape into the atmosphere where they
damage the high-altitude ozone shield that protects the earth from
the sun's ultraviolet radiation,.
   The United States and 44 other countries have agreed to phase
out the production of CFCs with hopes of eliminating them
altogether by the turn of the century.
   The companies participating in the announcement Tuesday were
AT&amp;T, Boeing, Digital Equipment, Ford Motor, General Electric,
Honeywell, Motorola, Northern Telecom and Texas Instruments.
   The organization, called the Industry Cooperative for Ozone
Layer Protection, will act as a clearinghouse for information on
new substitute solvents, encourage the prompt adoption of safe
substitutes, and work with producers and the government to
distribute information about substitutes to developing countries.

<HEAD>Government Puts FADA Up For Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators say they will try to sell
the Federal Asset Disposition Association, a quasi-private company
created to manage and sell sour loans and real estate from failed
savings institutions.
   FADA in structure is a private financial institution, but it is
wholly owned by the federal government.
   Until early last year, it was under intense congressional
scrutiny after critics complained that FADA had grown into a
bloated, inefficient bureaucracy mired in political favortism and
insider dealing.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., a 2-month-old government agency
created to handle failed S&amp;Ls, said Tuesday it will accept bids
until Oct. 31 for a sale to settle no later than Nov. 30.
   If no bids are acceptable, FADA will be taken over by the
government and its 275 employees offered government jobs working
for the RTC.
   FADA manages about $3 billion in real estate and loans from
failed thrifts, having disposed of $1.3 billion in the four years
since it was created.
   FADA's purchaser will acquire offices in Washington, Los
Angeles, Atlanta, Denver and Dallas, a computer system, office
furnishings and not much else.
   The sale will not include the agency's name, stock, charter as a
financial institution, cash or the right to retain government
management contracts.
   John Wills, president of FADA, said his organization offers
buyers a core of real estate experts ready to participate in a
flood of work as the government attempts to resolve the S&amp;L mess,
including the sale of an estimated $100 billion in hard-to-sell
real estate and bad loans.
   ``If you intend to get into the asset management business, it's
one way to way get the largest group of professionals that have
expertise in managing these troubled assets coming out of the
thrift industry,'' he said.
   Wills acknowledged past criticism, but said: ``Every single rock
in FADA was turned over and examined. If anything, because of the
intense scrutiny, we came out of it much more sound than any
comparable organization.''
   Wills said about 40 companies have expressed varying degrees of
interest in FADA. But industry officials believe the core of
serious buyers is much smaller.
   The successful bidder would have three alternatives: seek
management contracts from the RTC, compete to buy property outright
from the RTC or offer its management services to financial
institutions and others that end up owning the S&amp;L property, Wills
said.
   J.E. Robert Cos., an Alexandria, Va., company specializing in
the management of distressed real estate, is among the
organizations considering making an offer for FADA, according to
company chairman Joseph E. Robert Jr.
   ``You might look at it as paying a headhunter fee to acquire the
services of 275 employees,'' he said. ``(FADA) will be of interest
to people already heavily engaged in this business who have a
confident feeling they'll be successful in expanding. Otherwise,
FADA becomes a very expensive enterprise.''
   Among other possible bidders, according to industry sources, are
NCNB Texas, a Dallas-based company that has already purchased the
deposits of several failed thrifts.

<HEAD>US Complains About European Limits on Imported TV Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States will file a fair-trade
complaint against the European Community over a non-binding quota
system designed to limit imported TV programs to no more than half
of all shows aired, says U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   Hills, who previously said the United States would fight any
local content rules the European Community implements for
television as part of its plan to remove trade barriers between its
member nations by 1992, said Tuesday she was ``deeply disturbed''
by the Oct. 3 decision on TV.
   Although the Television Without Frontiers directive was not
binding on member nations, Hills said it was ``blatantly
protectionist and unjustifiable, and discriminates against U.S. and
other non-EC film goods.''
   In Brussels, Belgium, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and other members of Congress held what Gephardt called a
``spirited exchange'' with European Community officials about the
new TV measure.
   ``We feel very strongly about this issue,'' said Gephardt.
``It's especially troubling for Americans to see a product that we
do have some skill in ... and some advantage to be closed down to
any extent.''
   Hills said she ``will take immediate action to address that
decision'' under the 96-nation free-trade accord known as the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   ``The United States government believes that the local content
requirement in the broadcast directive is inconsistent with the
community's obligation not to discriminate against foreign products
_ to give equal treatment _ under the GATT. I am initiating prompt
action in that forum,'' Hills said in a prepared statement.
   GATT has no police power over its member nations, but Hills'
action indicates the Bush administration is having second thoughts
about the European Community's 1992 program.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher last week told a House
foreign affairs subcommittee that the United States may have to
reassess its position if the European Community continues towards
local content rules in areas such as television, computer chips,
telecommunications equipment and automobiles.
   According to industry figures, the United States realizes a $3
billion annual surplus balance of trade through film and TV
exports, and Europe is the leading market for such programs with
about $700 million in purchases yearly.
   TV series such as ``Miami Vice'' and ``Dallas'' are enormously
popular in Europe, which has caused legislators there to decry the
``Americanization'' of their populaces.
   Officials estimate that out of 125,000 hours of TV shown in
Western Europe annually, only 20,000 hours are produced in Europe.
Japan, Australia and the United States provide the remainder.
   France had urged mandatory quotas be placed on TV programming,
but the EC declined to do so.
   Hills said the cultural argument was a smokescreen for economic
protectionism.
   ``We do not understand why the Spanish culture is more protected
by a film produced in Germany by `Europeans' than by a Spanish film
of Mexican origin, or why the English culture is promoted more by a
film produced in France by `Europeans' than by a film of New
Zealand origin. ... The definition of `European works' is economic,
not cultural,'' she said.
   She added that U.S. concerns were further heightened by press
reports that the EC is pledging hundreds of millions of additional
dollars in subsidies to European producers and writers.

   If he succeeds with his bold $7 billion buyout
bid for AMR Corp., developer Donald Trump pledges to keep the
parent of American Airlines at its headquarters in Fort Worth,
Texas.
   ``I have absolutely no intention of moving American from the
Dallas-Fort Worth area,'' Trump said Tuesday in a telephone
interview from his New York office.
   Trump, who said he knows and likes the Dallas-Fort Worth area,
appeared to make the statement to reassure AMR employees. The head
of American's second-largest union, the 16,000-member Association
of Professional Flight Attendants, recently met with advisers to
discuss possible ways to help management fend off Trump's bid.
   AMR has had little to say about Trump's offer beyond its initial
response that the bid would be considered ``in due course,''
although the company said it preferred to remain independent.
   Trump's $120-a-share cash offer for the nation's largest and
most profitable airline has been met with suspicion by many in the
financial community, who see it as a ploy to drive up the price of
AMR stock and enhance Trump's own holdings.
   AMR tumbled $3.375 a share to $101.375 Tuesday in active trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, apparently reflecting investor
skepticism about Trump's offer.
   A major institutional investor said Tuesday it had joined the
list of Trump doubters.
   Since Thursday, when Trump's offer was made public, Windsor Fund
sold its 425,000 shares to take advantage of the increase stock
price, said John B. Neff, who has managed the fund for 25 years.
   ``I have a hard time taking Mr. Trump seriously. $120's a very
full price, and I don't know where the financing is going to come
from,'' Neff said. ``This isn't loose change.''
   But the real estate tycoon insists his intentions are real.
``I'm very serious about it,'' he said. ``I think this is a company
with great potential and I look forward to getting it.''
   Trump declined to provide details of his financing plan,
although he said it involves ``relatively little leverage'' and no
foreign investors _ two major areas of concern raised by the
Department of Transportation regarding the current wave of airline
buyouts.
   Trump told AMR last week that he would put up $1 billion of
equity in the deal and believes financing is readily available for
the remainder.
   The developer has a reputation as a good customer who has paid
off debts and has warm relations with bankers. His blue-chip real
estate and casino properties could be readily borrowed against,
while AMR's assets also could be considered as collateral,
observers say.

<HEAD>Dollar Closes Higher, Stocks Plunge in Tokyo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar closed higher against the yen today
despite the Bank of Japan's discount rate increase and massive
dollar selling, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged.
   The dollar closed at 143.90 yen, up 1.67 yen from Monday's close
of 142.23 yen. It opened at 144.90 yen and moved between 142.55 yen
and 144.95 yen.
   Currency and stock markets were closed Tuesday for a Japanese
holiday.
   The dollar's high opening followed overseas rallies overnight,
but it edged down in early trading amid rumors of an increase in
the discount rate, the charge for funds borrowed by banks from the
central bank.
   After the morning session, the bank raised the rate by 0.5
percentage point to 3.75 percent. Higher interest rates tend to
make a country's currency more attractive to investors, pushing up
its value.
   ``The decision came in consideration of recent currency market
fluctuations, movements in foreign interest rates, domestic
economic trends, consumer prices and the money supply,'' Bank of
Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita told a news conference.
   The dollar had climbed to a closing of 145 yen on Sept. 22
before monetary officials of seven major industrialized nations
decided on efforts to check its rise. It dropped to 139.30 yen on
Oct. 2, but has been moving generally upward since.
   ``The Bank of Japan hopes the rate hike will contribute to
sustainable growth led by domestic demand while maintaining
consumer price stability,'' Sumita said, adding that the move was
intended to stem inflation.
   Although West Germany also had raised its official discount rate
last week, Sumita said Japan's decision was reached independently.
   Toru Kanai, foreign currency analyst with New Japan Securities
Co. Ltd., said, the discount rate increase ``came out of the blue,
and many of us had expected the U.S. discount rate cut to come
first.''
   Daiwa Securities dealer Kazuyuki Suzuki added: ``I never dreamed
that the Bank of Japan would take such a step prior to reports of
important economic indicators such as the U.S. wholesale price
index, due out Friday.''
   Yoshitsugu Hanada, a senior trader with Mitsui Bank, said the
central bank also sold large amounts of dollars in the afternoon in
an attempt to push the dollar down, but the U.S. currency still
showed strength.
   ``Speculative investors were still inclined to buy the dollar
because that's one of their few decent choices of investment,
considering the uptrend in domestic interest rates, narrowing the
gap with those overseas,'' Hanada said.
   The Nikkei Stock Exchange lost 136.28 points, or 0.39 percent,
closing at 35,240.07. It had gained 167 points Monday.
   The index plunged about 360 points after the discount rate
increase was announced, but recovered as some investors took
advantage of lower prices to buy various issues, Suzuki said.
   ``But the latest discount rate hike will certainly damage the
stock market, which no longer will grow as fast as it used to,'' he
added.
   Stock trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated
at 750 million shares, up from Monday's 700 million.
   It was the second discount rate increase this year. On May 30,
it was raised 0.75 percentage points, to 3.25 percent.

   The dollar rose in early European trading today,
despite a half-point increase in the Japanese discount rate and
massive dollar-selling in earlier Asian trading. Gold prices fell.
   ``Half a point was too little. The market had expected a full
point, so we will probably go a bit firmer,'' said one dealer at a
private bank in Frankfurt.
   The Bank of Japan and the U.S. Federal Reserve were both

<HEAD>Telerate Panel Rejects Dow Jones Offer for Remaining 33 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. says it intends to proceed
with its $576 million tender offer for the 33 percent of Telerate
Inc. that it does not already own even though Telerate's directors
found the offer inadeqaute.
   ``We are proceeding with our $18 per share offer and continue to
believe that the offer is fair to all Telerate stockholders,'' Dow
Jones Chairman Warren H. Phillips said Tuesday.
   Wall Streeters evidently expect that Dow Jones will have to
sweeten its bid, however. Telerate rose 12{ cents a share to close
at $20.37{ on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Telerate, a provider of computerized financial information, said
a special panel of its directors urged shareholders not to tender
their stock under terms of the Dow Jones offer and urged Dow Jones
to arrange a meeting ``in order to achieve a mutually agreed upon
transaction.''
   Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, said it was
disappointed by the panel's assessment of its offer but indicated
it has no plans to raise it or negotiate with the committee.
   Peter Skinner, Dow Jones' vice president, corporate counsel and
secretary, said Dow Jones ``has no plans to meet with the Telerate
special committee'' and no plans to raise its bid.
   Dow Jones, which also publishes Barron's magazine, community
newspapers and electronic business information, became involved
with Telerate in 1985 when it purchased a 32 percent stake in the
company. It subsequently increased its stake to 67 percent.
   On Sept. 21, Dow Jones said it planned to offer $18 a share for
the remaining Telerate shares, and began the tender offer five days
later. The offer and withdrawal rights are scheduled to expire Nov.
3.
   Skinner said Dow Jones' investment bankers have since met with
those of the Telerate special committee to describe how it came to
the pricing of its offer, although not to negotiate any terms.
   In its announcement Tuesday, Telerate said that the special
panel, with concurrence of other Telerate directors who are not
employed by or consultants to Dow Jones, found the $18 a share
offer ``inadequate and not in the best interests of its
stockholders.''
   Telerate's founder and chief executive, Neil S. Hirsch, said he
will not tender any of his shares, which represent about 6 percent
of the company's stock, and that no other director or executive of
Telerate would tender under the current offer.
   Hirsch said the special committee had ``received clear
indications'' from stockholders owning another 5 percent of
Telerate's stock of their ``genuine dissatisfaction with the price
Dow Jones is offering.''
   On Monday, Telerate reported its third-quarter earnings dropped
17.4 percent compared with a year earlier and said it is in
negotiations to buy the 50 percent stake that its partner American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. owns in the joint venture Global
Transactions Services Co.
   Telerate and AT&amp;T began the venture in 1987 to develop an
electronic service for foreign-exchange transactions. The service
was recently launched.

<HEAD>Boeing-Machinist Talks Could Resume Within Week, Union Leader Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Eastern</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>

   Contract talks in the eight-day walkout by Boeing
Co. Machinists could resume within a week, a key union leader says.
   There have been no talks since some 57,800 Machinists left their
jobs on Oct. 4.
   Federal mediator Doug Hammond has been in daily contact with
both sides and will call for talks ``when he gets a signal ... a
feeling that there's a reason to call the parties together,'' said
Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751.
   ``I think that within a week, we'll see that process starting,''
Baker said Tuesday.
   The last Boeing strike was a 45-day walkout by the Machinists in
1977, and ``two months is not really long'' for the aerospace
industry, Baker said.
   Boeing on Tuesday delivered the third jetliner it has completed
since the walkout began. It was a 747-400 received by Qantas
Airways Ltd. of Australia.
   The company said another three dozen or so might be completed by
supervisors and Machinists crossing picket lines.
   Meanwhile, Boeing's second-largest union, the 27,000-person
Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association, voted to
seek a 14 percent wage increase when its talks begin Monday.
   So far, the Machinists' walkout has not strained relations with
airlines and jet leasing companies, despite worldwide pressure to
replace aging aircraft with quieter, more technologically advanced
and fuel-efficient models, Boeing spokesman Harold Carr said
Tuesday.
   ``They understand it's just one of those facts of doing
business,'' he said.
   He said about three dozen aircraft were on the ``flight lines,''
with almost all basic assembly completed. Each still requires
exhaustive calibration of instruments, testing and ``maybe a little
touch-up work'' normally done by the strikers, Carr said.
   ``They go all the way from within days to two months or so''
away from delivery, he said.
   After five consecutive years of record orders, Boeing has a
backlog stretching into the late 1990s.
   In completing aircraft for delivery, ``the initial concentration
is on the flight lines,'' Carr said.
   Another 28 or 29 planes are in various stages of assembly on the
737 and 757 lines in Renton and the 747 and 767 lines in Everett,
but they probably cannot be completed without major defections from
union ranks, Carr said.
   ``It's unrealistic to think you can replace 43,000 skilled
people,'' he said.
   Boeing's offer, spurned by Machinists in an 85 percent strike
vote Oct. 3, featured an immediate wage hike of 4 percent with 3
percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, bonuses of 8 percent of
worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent in 1990, a
cost-of-living clause to virtually match inflation, a reduction in
mandatory overtime and increases in some benefits.
   Baker's local represents about 43,300 Boeing workers in Seattle
and its suburbs. Another 12,000 or so work in Wichita, Kan., 1,700
in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred others at sites in several
other states.
   Boeing earned $356 million on sales of $9.07 billion for the
first half of 1989 and reported $614 million in profits on $16.96
billion in sales in 1988.
   In a meeting Monday night, members of the engineers and
technical workers group adopted as bargaining goals wage increases
of 14 percent in the first year, 9 percent in the second year, 8
percent in the first half of the third year and 4 percent in the
second half of the final year, plus quarterly cost-of-living
adjustments and an unspecified lump-sum bonus.
   Engineers and technical workers, bound by a no-strike clause in
a contract expiring Dec. 1, have been crossing the Machinists'
picket lines while refusing to do work normally done by the
strikers.
   The current three-year contract boosted wages by 3 percent, 2
percent and 2 percent for engineers and 2 percent, 2 percent and 3
percent for technical workers. Engineers also got a one-time 9
percent bonus and technical employees bonuses of 5 percent the
first year and nearly 3 percent in each of the next two years.

<TEXT>
   Life for Chrysler Corp. executive Bennett Bidwell
would have been a lot easier if Soichiro Honda hadn't done what he
had done.
   Bidwell, speaking Tuesday night at the annual Automotive Hall of
Fame dinner, said competition among automakers in the 1990s will be
tougher than ever and part of that is because of Honda.
   The 82-year-old founder of Honda Motor Co. Ltd. was among four
people inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame. He is the first
Japanese national honored by the group that began in 1939 as the
Automobile Old Timers.
   Honda was a man ``without whom my life would have been a lot
easier,'' said Bidwell, chairman of Chrysler's manufacturing arm,
Chrysler Motors Corp.
   There has been speculation that if Honda's U.S. sales keep
growing and if Chrysler's keep falling, the Japanese company could
become the third-largest selling auto company in the United States.
   Earlier in the day, Honda brushed aside such speculation,
saying, ``If we make progress, so will Chrysler. So I don't think
the difference between the two companies will become that much
smaller.''
   But competition is high on the mind of Bidwell and other auto
executives.
   ``There is conventional, nuclear, and thermonuclear warfare,''
he said. ``We are at stage three.
   ``I said for five years it is a jungle out there. It isn't
anymore. It's worse.''
   He said that for a time Chrysler had pretty much locked up the
market on three segments _ minivans, four-door sport-utility
vehicles and convertibles.
   ``Now they (the market segments) look like Grand Central
Station,'' Bidwell said. ``There is a fight to the finish and in a
fight to the finish ... the low-cost producer wins, the high-cost
producer loses.''
   Bidwell made only a passing remark about the company's effort to
slash $1 billion out of its $26 billion budget by the end of next
year. Included in that are the elimination of about 8 percent of
the salaried work force, or about 2,300 jobs.
   ``We will take suggestions (about cost cutting) about anything
from anywhere,'' he said.
   Honda's motorcycle company began making cars in 1963. It became
the first Japanese company to set up a manufacturing plant in the
United States and later this year will open its second. Both, along
with an engine factory and a research facility, are located in Ohio.
   ``Our company in Ohio has been so well accepted ...'' he said,
``that I truly believe it is an American company.''
   Inducted with Honda were:
   _Gordon Buehrig, the chief engineer of the Dusenberg, Cord and
Auburn Speedster automobiles.
   _Frank Kent, a Cadillac dealer in Fort Worth, Texas.
   _Elmer Wavering, who installed the first radio in a car and went
on to develop the first commercially successful car radio in 1930.
He later became associated with Motorola Inc.

<HEAD>Antonini Says New Stores, Ad Appearances Will Help 4th Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A persistent economy, precision marketing and
even some personal television appearances could help K mart Corp.
out of its 1989 sales doldrums, company Chairman Joseph Antonini
says.
   Antonini also outlined a $1.3-billion expansion plan Tuesday
that would increase the number of K mart discount stores to 2,500
by 1995, from the current 2,283.
   The chairman told a news conference he is trying his new
advertising approach in commercials being tested in the Pueblo and
Colorado Springs areas of Colorado.
   ``I can go on TV in front of the American public and tell them
what we are doing,'' he said, adding that he will appear nationally
in commercials on two K mart-produced Christmas specials.
   One is ``Christmas in America,'' a movie starring Kenny Rogers.
The other is a program on Christmas entertaining with author Martha
Stewart, who also lends her name to a line of K mart household
products.
   Antonini said lower-than-expected inflation and interest rates
and better-than-expected employment are raising his hopes for
strong holiday sales that could rescue an otherwise slow year.
   ``We're more optimistic than we were four months ago,'' he said.
   The fourth quarter is the last hope for a strong year; K mart
said last week that third-quarter profits will be down from last
year.
   The fourth quarter also could get a boost as K mart opens 43 new
stores and finishes the expansion of 63 others this fall, Antonini
said.
   Beyond that time, profit margins will improve as the company
connects 2,200 of its stores to its centralized inventory computer
system by the end of next year for greater marketing precision,
Antonini said.
   ``We know what product sells in Hoboken, New Jersey, we know the
price it sells for, and we know how many sold on Monday,'' he said.
``We never knew that before.''
   Television advertising will be stepped up, he said. After buying
about 24 weeks of national television advertising for this year,
the company will increase that to about 30 weeks next year and key
some ads to products featured in its newspaper circulars.
   K mart predicted sagging third-quarter earnings last week when
it reported September sales of $2.6 billion. That was up 6.1
percent from September 1988, but up only 3 percent when comparing
stores open for the full year.
   The company reported earnings of $145 million, down 10.9
percent, for its second fiscal quarter, which ended July 26.
Second-quarter sales of $7 billion were up 4.8 percent.
   For the fiscal year, beginning Feb. 1, sales reached $17.7
billion through Sept. 27, up only 4.7 percent overall and a
sluggish 1.2 percent on a comparable store basis.
   K mart reported fiscal 1988 earnings of $803 million on sales of
$27.3 billion.

   The stock market declined broadly today,
continuing the pullback that began in Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 6.85 to 2,778.48
in th e first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 340 up, 680 down and
483 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.6 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to
cash in their gains after the market's rise to record highs last
week and Monday.
   The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a
dimming of hopes for any moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy.
   Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes
of some stimulus from the Fed, were mixed in today's credit-market
activity.
   In addition, the Bank of Japan raised its influential discount
rate from 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down [ at
45[; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down ] at 42|; McDonald's,

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .48 to 198.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .20 at 396.83.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 6.08 points to

   New York brokerage firm Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
says it has sold its retail brokerage operations in Florida and
Puerto Rico to Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc.
   The sale announced Tuesday includes seven offices in Florida and
one in San Juan.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but a Kidder spokeswoman
said the eight offices accounted for 3 percent of the $956 million
in revenues earned by Kidder Peabody last year.
   The sale means the consolidation of Kidder and Merrill Lynch
offices in cities where each firm has operations. By the end of the
month, the 230 Kidder employees will be working for Merrill Lynch,
said Merrill Lynch spokesman Fred Yager in New York.
   Merrill Lynch _ the largest U.S.-based global financial services
company _ is buying Kidder offices in Miami, Tampa, Fort
Lauderdale, Boca Raton, Winter Park, Sarasota and Jacksonville.
   With the purchase, Merrill Lynch will have 68 offices in Florida
and Puerto Rico. The move gives Florida more Merrill Lynch
brokerages than any other state, Yager said, adding that California
is next in line with 65.

   The owner of the Denver Nuggets says he has called
off the $65 million sale of the basketball franchise to two
businessmen who stood to become the first black owners of a major
U.S. professional sports team.
   Sidney Shlenker said in a statement Tuesday that he was allowing
the contract for the sale of the NBA team to Peter Bynoe, 38, and
Bertram Lee, 50, both of Chicago, to expire. The two had planned to
buy the club in a deal announced in July.
   Bynoe and Lee had missed at least two deadlines for completing
the deal since it was announced, and there had been several signs
in recent weeks that the deal was shaky.
   However, Lee, reached at home in Chicago today, said, ``No,
that's not true,'' when asked about the deal falling through. He
referred further questions to a public relations firm, which did
not immediately return calls. Bynoe also did not return calls.
   Shlenker had earlier set a deadline of 5 p.m. Tuesday for Bynoe
and Lee to complete the deal, but team officials said work was
continuing after the deadline. About four hours later, the team
said Shlenker had backed out.
   Bynoe and Lee apparently had the financing in place but the
documentation was incomplete, said Dave Checketts, who was to take
over as president under the new ownership.
   ``It's just a matter of going through all the documents,'' Bynoe
said on Monday. ``I am optimistic we will be able to do what needs
to be done, but I can't speak for Sidney.''

<HEAD>United Telecom Announces Consolidation With US Sprint Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Telecommunications said today it
will consolidate operations with its US Sprint long-distance
company to make the corporation more efficient as Sprint continues
rapid growth.
   ``These organizational changes will allow United Telecom and US
Sprint to operate largely as a single company,'' said William T.
Esrey, president and chief executive officer of both United Telecom
and Sprint.
   It also will make the company better at setting strategy and
increase profits by cutting down on duplications, he said.
   United Telecom now owns 80.1 percent of Sprint, the nation's
third-largest long-distance company. GTE Corp. of Stamford, Conn.,
owns 19.9 percent.
   Sprint was started in July 1986 as a joint venture between
United Telecom and GTE. United Telecom bought controlling interest
in January, and spokesman Don Forsythe said the company has an
agreement to buy GTE's remaining shares at some point in the future.
   Sprint, which lost more than $1 billion for its parent companies
from mid-1986 to the end of 1988, began showing its first-ever
quarterly profits in March thanks to strong sales growth on its
fiber-optic long-distance system.
   On Tuesday, United Telecom reported its profits jumped 75
percent in the third quarter because of Sprint's second straight
quarter of billion-dollar sales. The company projected further
growth as Sprint begins work on a contract to provide 40 percent of
a new communications system for the federal government.
   Under the realignment of the two companies, Esrey, 49, will
remain in his United Telecom post but switch to chairman and CEO of
Sprint.
   Ronald T. LeMay, 43, will become president and chief operating
officer of Sprint and president of United Telecom's long-distance
division. LeMay previously served as executive vice president of
corporate affairs for United Telecom.
   The companies' legal, financial and data systems operations will
be consolidated, and the company will form a US Sprint
International Systems and Services Group in Reston, Va.
   Both companies have their headquarters in the Kansas City area.
   In addition to Sprint, United Telecom also owns local telephone
companies in the South and Midwest.

<HEAD>Most Crop Futures Rise Technical Recovery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
higher this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade, bouncing back
from recent steep losses on buying inspired by technical factors
and new export business.
   Soybean futures displayed the greatest strength in early trading
after falling to 23-month lows Tuesday under heavy harvest-related
selling.
   ``The markets have really gotten battered around lately and were
oversold,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst at Research Department
Inc. in Chicago.
   Some of the recent losses were linked to expectations that the
Agriculture Department will increase its 1989 corn and soybean
harvest estimates in a crop report due out after the close of
trading on Thursday.
   But Conrad Leslie, an influential private crop analyst based in
Chicago, released pre-report estimates late Tuesday that fell below
general market expectations, prompting some buying this morningg.
   Additional support today stemmed from USDA confirmation late
Tuesday that the Soviet Union purchased 150,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybean meal.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to 1\ cents
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $4.06} a
bushel; corn futures were { cent to 1{ cents higher with December
at $2.34} a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with
December at $1.41{ a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 6 cents
higher with November at $5.56\ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were narrowly mixed while pork bellies were
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>May Department Stores Sells Caldor For $500 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. said Wednesday that
it has reached an agreement to sell its Caldor discount stores for
$500 million to CAL Holdings, Inc.
   CAL Holdings is a new company formed by Odyssey Partners, L.P.,
Caldor management led by Don R. Clarke, chairman and chief
executive officer, and Marc I. Balmuth, president, and Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Capital Corp.
   May, one of the nation's leading department store companies, has
been trying to sell Caldor and its other chain of discount stores,
Venture, for several months.
   CAL Holdings will pay $500 million in cash and assume $52
million in debt and lease obligations to get Caldor, a chain of
more than 100 stores located primarily in the Northeast. May also
will acquire a 20 percent equity interest in CAL Holdings.
   Linda Kristiansen, a stock analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds in
New York, said she was not happy with the deal because she thought
the Caldor chain was probably worth more.
   The deal is expected to be completed early next month.
   May, headquartered in St. Louis, owns 14 department store chains
in 29 states and the District of Columbia, 75 Venture stores in the
Midwest, 2,663 Payless shoe stores.

   Stock prices sustained a broad loss today,
continuing the pullback that began in Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 on Tuesday,
dropped 26.11 to 2,759.22 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 358 up, 952
down and 527 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to
cash in their gains after the market's rise to record highs last
week and Monday.
   The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a
dimming of hopes for any moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy.
   Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes
of some stimulus from the Fed, were mixed in today's credit-market
activity.
   In addition, the Bank of Japan raised its influential discount
rate from 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent.
   AMR dropped 2 to 99] in active trading on word that the company
was asking for legislation to help it ward off a takeover bid by
investor Donald Trump.
   Ramada Inc. fell 2{ to 10}. The company said it wasn't
proceeding with a an offering of debt securities that had been
planned as part of a restructuring program.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down } at

   A helicopter apparently lost its
main rotor and crashed onto a highway median, killing all five
people aboard, including three executives of Donald Trump's casino
empire.
   ``There was a loud bang, like a piston rod going,'' said Tom
Murray, 38, of East Providence, R.I., who was camping near the site
of Tuesday afternoon's crash, a wooded thicket between lanes of the
Garden State Parkway.
   ``It fell below the tree-line and I didn't see it crash,'' he
said. ``It went straight down. ... It seemed like an eternity
watching it.''
   No one on the ground was hurt.
   A Trump executive today disputed a report in the New York Daily
News that the billionarie developer had been scheduled to take the
one-hour flight to Atlantic but canceled at the last moment because
he got too busy.
   ``Trump had definitely never planned to be on it,'' said Bernie
Dillon, the vice president of Trump Sports and Entertainment.
   State Police Sgt. Anthony Aceto said the main rotor was found a
quarter-mile from the crash site about 30 miles north of Atlantic
City, where the helicopter was returning the executives from New
York City.
   The National Transportation Safety Board investigators were
looking into a rotor malfunction, said Frank Ghiorsi, the agency's
regional director.
   ``If the main rotor separated from the rest of the aircraft, it
was out of control,'' Ghiorsi said.
   He said investigators were looking for the tail rotor to help
them re-create the problem. Investigators said the loss of one of
the two rotors could have caused the other to fall off.
   Trump spokesman Dan Klores identified the executives as Stephen
Hyde, 43, chief executive officer of Trump's Atlantic City casino
operations; Mark G. Etess, 38, president of the Taj Mahal casino
project; and, Jonathan Benanav, 33, senior vice president of Trump
Plaza casino hotel.
   ``They were three fabulous young men in the prime of their
lives,'' billionaire developer Donald Trump said in a statement
from his New York office. ``No better human beings ever existed.
We're deeply saddened by this devastating tragedy. Our hearts go
out to their families.''
   The others killed were pilot Robert Kent of Ronkonkoma, N.Y.,
and co-pilot Lawrence Diener of Westbury, N.Y., State Police said.
   The helicopter, a 1982 Agusta 109A, was leased from Paramount
Aviation of Lincoln Park, and had taken off from Manhattan for
Atlantic City, officials said. Officials at Paramount Aviation said
they could not answer questions about the crash.
   Traffic was delayed because of the crash, but the road remained
open.
   Joe Librizzi, manager of a parkway maintenance crew, said he was
one of the first to reach the wreckage.
   ``I walked in and turned right around,'' he said. ``I walked in
there and all I saw was one body thrown out of the helicopter. ...
I saw another slumped over.''
   Investigators were trying to determine if the pilot was in radio
contact with air traffic controllers before the crash, said Alan
Yurman, an NTSB air safety director.
   Helicopters are not equipped with flight data and cockpit voice
recorders _ the ``black boxes'' aboard commercial airliners.
   The Trump executives had been in New York City for a news
conference promoting the Feb. 3 World Boxing Organization bout at
the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino between junior welterweights
Hector Camacho and Vinny Pazienza.

   NBC ``Today'' show co-anchor Jane Pauley says
she probably will leave the program by the end of the year but will
stay with the network ``in some fashion or other,'' The Washington
Post reported today.
   Neither she nor the network would comment on the report.
   NBC News spokeswoman Peggy Hubble said a statement on Pauley's
future probably would be made later in the day. Ms. Pauley, who has
two years left on her NBC News contract, didn't return calls and
was reported by her office out taping an interview.
   ``I am definitely staying at NBC,'' the Post quoted Ms. Pauley
as saying in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Pauley has been co-anchor of ``Today'' for 13 years, but her
future with the program has been the subject of speculation in the
weeks since Deborah Norville took over as newscaster on the program.
   ``Thirteen years ago today Jane Pauley began on `Today,'''
co-anchor Bryant Gumbel said at the opening of this morning's
broadcast. ``That's a long time. Is that a lifetime?''
   ``It's a long time. It's my whole adult life, virtually,'' Ms.
Pauley responded. ``Thank you.''
   At the end of the broadcast, the words ``Happy Anniversary''
flashed on the screen.
   Ms. Pauley told the newspaper there has been no hostility among
members of the ``Today'' cast, although she did say the place has
been more tense since Ms. Norville swapped duties with John Palmer,
who has been sent to ``NBC News at Sunrise.''
   ``When it was first revealed to me that John and Deborah were
going to switch, that was a real blow,'' Ms. Pauley was quoted as
saying. ``I like him very much, and I thought, `Why John? What did
he do to anybody?' But as soon as you say anything, it sounds like
a jealous older woman talking about a younger one.''
   Ms. Norville is 31; Ms. Pauley will be 39 at the end of this
month.
   Ms. Pauley told her interviewer that if she does leave
``Today,'' she would ``still like to come back to the show now and
then in the future, the way Barbara Walters does at `Good Morning
America.' It would be very unlike me to leave on bad terms.
   ``As it stands now, I am staying (with NBC) in some fashion or
other.''
   Ms. Pauley's agent has been negotiating with NBC since August,
when Ms. Norville was promoted. NBC executives, who thought she was
after more money, were startled when she submitted her resignation,
according to unidentified sources cited by the Post.
   ``Deborah and I are on great terms. It's not Deborah's fault she
is very talented and very beautiful and younger than I,'' Ms.
Pauley said. ``And my relationship with (Gumbel) is as good as it's
ever been.''
   Reports of bickering among the show's cast members have
circulated since March, when a memo written by Gumbel was leaked.
In the memo, he criticized his colleagues, especially weatherman
Willard Scott. Ms. Pauley was not mentioned.
   ``We remain very, very good friends,'' Ms. Pauley said,
referring to Gumbel.

<HEAD>Norwegian Pioneer in Econometrics Wins Prize</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with seven grafs to UPDATE with Haavelmo quote; picks
up 8th pvs: Econometrics holds ...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trygve Haavelmo of Norway won the Nobel
Memorial Prize in Economic Science today for showing that
mathematical probabilities could be used to predict the puzzling
shifts in the economy.
   Haavelmo's work in 1941 pioneered the field of econometrics,
which introduced statistical probability to economic forecasting,
the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.
   Colleagues said the 77-year-old Haavelmo has shunned publicity
in the past and disdained awards. He was unreachable at his home in
the Oslo suburb of Baerum for about five hours after the Nobel was
announced.
   He later told the national NRK television that he was
``flustered'' and declined to be interviewed. But said he may issue
a written statement later.
   ``I'm grateful for all the attention, but I'm a little
perplexed, so I can't be very much help to you,'' he said.
   Haavelmo, a professor of economics at Oslo University, was the
second Norwegian to win the economics prize. He was a research
assistant to Ragnar Frisch, who won the prize in 1969, the first
year it was awarded.
   The prize is worth about $469,000.
   Econometrics holds that economic theories can be proven by
testing them with mathematical and statistical models.
   Assar Lindbeck, chairman of the prize committee, called Haavelmo
``the father of modern econometrics'' and a dominant figure in
post-war economic theories.
   ``Through his new economic theory, scientists have learned to
anticipate how governmental institutions react and how they
influence people's decisions,'' Lindbeck said when announcing the
prize.
   Meghnad Desai, a professor at the London School of Economics,
said: ``I'm very happy he got the prize ... There has been a
tendency to give prizes to people who benefited from his work and
he has been in danger of being ignored.''
   Haavelmo's 1941 doctoral thesis, which he presented at Harvard
University, ``had a swift and pathbreaking influence on the
development of econometrics,'' the academy said in a summary of his
achievements.
   His theories ``gave rise to extraordinarily rapid methodological
development'' and established ``the foundation of modern
econometric methods,'' the statement said.
   Haavelmo went to the United States on a Rockefeller grant in
1939, was a professor at the University of Chicago and worked for
the Norwegian Trade Commission.
   He returned to Norway in 1947 and has been at Oslo University
since 1948.
   Haavelmo, the son of a school administrator, is a member of the
American Economic Association and the American Academy of Arts and
Sciences. He was born Dec. 13, 1911, in the Norwegian town of
Skedsmo.
   The academy said Haavelmo's theories overcame the problems
economists faced because they were unable to test their ideas in
the same ways as scientists who work in laboratories.
   Economists also could not weed out the influence of millions of
individual decisions that people and companies make that disturb
the models theorists devised.
   Haavelmo overcame these difficulties by introducing the idea of
statistical probability.
   ``He also showed that misleading interpretations of individual
relations due to interdependence cannot be avoided unless all
relations in a theoretical model are estimated simultaneously,''
the academy said.
   In such areas as investment theories and economic development,
``Haavelmo's approach has resulted in influential and far-reaching
contributions,'' the academy said.
   The approach also has helped in the analysis of macroeconomic
fluctuations, fiscal policies, and price theory,'' it said.
   Last year's Nobel Laureate was Maurice Allais of France, who won
the prize for his theories of how price systems can work to keep
economies in balance. He was the first French economist to join the
list of economic laureates.
   Americans have dominated the 19-year history of the prize,
taking 15 of the 26 awards since it was created by the Bank of
Sweden. Five winners were British.
   The economics prize is a late addition to the five awards
established in the 1896 will of Alfred Nobel, who bequeathed his
fortune from the invention of dynamite to reward scientific
breakthroughs, activities for peace, and literature ``of an
idealistic tendency.''

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Drops $100 Million Prop-Fan Jet Engine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Corp. said it is
dropping its $100 million prop-fan jet engine program and instead
will focus on a new generation of fuel-efficient aircraft.
   The new twin-engine, mid-range commercial transport series,
dubbed the MD-90, was previewed on Tuesday.
   McDonnell Douglas said it decided to drop the prop-fan engine,
which it once touted as a ``step in aviation history'' because
buyers aren't interested in the innovative design.
   ``After a number of years of research, this is what the
customers are telling us they want,'' said Walter Orlowski,
McDonnell's MD-90 program general manager.
   McDonnell Douglas introduced the experimental prop-fan engine in
February 1988. It resembled a standard jet engine housing fitted
with external blades similar to light aircraft propellers, but with
16 curved blades.
   The novelty and designers' claims about increased fuel
efficiency failed to excite customers in the airline industry,
officials said.
   Despite projections that the engine could reduce fuel
consumption by 40 percent, McDonnell Douglas failed to get a single
order for the engine type, company vice president John Wolf said.
   ``Our customers indicated they were not interested in buying
it,'' Wolf said.
   The gamble to develop the prop-fan engine was based on the
belief that the price of jet fuel would increase in the 1980s, but
prices instead held steady.
   The MD-90 aircrafts, which will come in two sizes, are also
designed to save fuel. The 114-seat version is expected to be 13
percent more fuel efficient and the 153-seat version will save 17
percent more fuel over older aircraft models, company officials
predicted.
   The company declined to say how much they planned to invest in
the new planes, but industry analysts estimate the development cost
at between $300 million to $400 million.
   The MD-90 series will be powered by a v2500 engine produced by
the consortium International Aero Engines. The consortium included
American manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney and the British firm
Rolls-Royce, West German, Italian and Japanese companies.
   Wolf declined to say how many orders the company needs to
receive before they begin production of the MD-90's but they have
already begun their pitch to airlines to line up orders. McDonnell
Douglas hopes to begin making deliveries as early as the fourth
quarter of 1994.
   The company spent about $100 million developing the prop-fan jet
engines, officials said.

<HEAD>Ramada Restructuring on Hold, Company Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc.'s restructuring, including the sale
of its hotels to a Hong Kong company, has been placed on hold, the
company said today.
   Ramada cited ``unfavorable conditions in the high-yield credit
market'' as the reason for its decision not to proceed with an
offering of $400 million in debt securities, which is a
prerequisite for the restructuring.
   The Phoenix-based company announced earlier this year that it
would sell its worldwide hotel business to New World Hotel Holdings
Ltd. of Hong Kong and form a new company, Aztar Corp., to operate
its Nevada and New Jersey casinos.
   Arranging financing for Aztar is a condition of completing the
sale, Ramada said.
   The company originally announced that it would offer $170
million in first-mortgage notes and $230 million in bonds and, on
Oct. 3, said it was considering issuing warrants for 10 percent of
Aztar's common stock.
   ``Ramada management intends to develop a revised restructuring
proposal that will involve a modification to the consideration to
be received by Ramada shareholders,'' the company said in a
statement.
   Shareholders were to have received cash and stock in Aztar under
the original plan.
   Any new plan would require amendment of provisions in the
agreement with New World and an extension of the Nov. 30 deadline
for completing the sale, the company said.
   It also would require approval of shareholders and gaming
regulators in Nevada and New Jersey.
   Ramada said it ``can offer no assurance that a restructuring
will be completed and it cannot specifiy the timing of the next
steps.''

<HEAD>Report: NWA to Unveil Major Jetliner Order with Boeing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines is expected to announce as
early as this week that it signed a contract for as many as 90
Boeing Co. jetliners, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
   The order, potentially valued at $5 billion, would be a blow to
Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that recently appeared to
have gained a firm foothold with the carrier, the Journal said.
   Northwest also was said to be considering six firm orders and
four options for new Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets that seat as many as
412 passengers, the Journal said.
   Northwest paid an estimated $96 million each for 747s when they
were first ordered in 1985. Now, Seattle-based Boeing prices the
747-400, its most expensive jetliner, at $116 million to $136
million apiece.
   It wasn't known whether Northwest's new owners have given final
approval to all details in the order, the newspaper reported.
   Northwest spokesman Kevin Whalen said today the airline would
have no comment on the report.
   ``It's no secret that we've been negotiating,'' Whalen said. But
he wouldn't say whether the company has settled on a contract with
one of the industry's three suppliers: Boeing, Airbus or McDonnell
Douglas Corp.
   Industry sources have said that Alfred Checchi, the Los Angeles
investor who led the group that recently bought Northwest parent
NWA Inc., has shown a strong preference for American-made aircraft,
the Journal said.
   Steven Rothmeier, NWA's recently departed chairman, had forged
the carrier's recent link with Airbus, the newspaper said.
   Jack Gamble, public relations manager for Boeing Commercial
Airplanes, said today he could not confirm the report.
   Gamble acknowledged that Boeing has been talking with Northwest
``for quite some time,'' but said any announcement of orders must
come from Boeing customers.
   According to the Journal, Airbus submitted a rival bid for 40
orders and 40 options on the new stretched version of the A320,
which is comparable in size to the 757.
   In June, Northwest said it became the first carrier in North
America to receive a high-technology low-noise Airbus A320 jetliner.
   The $30 million plane was the first to be delivered from an
order by Northwest for 25 medium-range Airbus A320 aircraft; since
June, six A320s have been delivered and are in service. The
Eagan-based airline also has options for 75 additional A320
aircraft to be delivered through 1995.
   The total order, including spare parts, is valued at $3.2
billion.
   Northwest also has 16 Airbus A330 aircraft on order for use in
North Atlantic and high-volume domestic routes. Those two-engine
aircraft carry 330 passengers and cost $86 million each.
   Northwest also has on order 20 Airbus A340s, a four-engine
wide-body jet that carries 280 passengers. Those jets will be used
on lower-volume routes in the Pacific and also to provide extra
capacity for very high-volume trans-Pacific routes.
   The company also has four options to purchase A330s or A340s,
said Northwest spokesman Doug Miller. Checchi has said he intends
to take delivery of the jets ordered by Rothmeier.
   The 747-400 planes, which have an 8,000-mile range, are expected
to be used to expand Northwest's Pacific routes, the Journal said.
The carrier already has five 747-400s in its fleet, with five more
on order, Miller said.

<TEXT>
   The PolyGram BV unit of Dutch-based NV Philips
has agreed to acquire privately-owned A&amp;M Records for about $500
million, PolyGram officials said today.
   The acquisition of A&amp;M, founded 27 years ago by trumpet player
Herb Alpert and his partner Jerry Moss, is the latest in a
longrunning series of foreign buyouts of U.S. record companies.
   PolyGram, which says it is the world's third largest music
group, said it would acquire all of A&amp;M's record operations plus
its music video interests, its Los Angeles offices, including the
former Charlie Chaplin film studios, and the A&amp;M recording studio.
   The acquisition does not include A&amp;M's music publishing
interests.
   PolyGram said the two founders of A&amp;M and its president, Gil
Friesen, will continue their day-to-day roles at the company after
the buyout.
   ``We are not seeing the demise of the independent record
company, rather the emergence of a new brand of independent,'' said
David Fine, PolyGram's president. He said the deal would give A&amp;M
``the resources and marketing infrastructure of a major worldwide
group.''
   At a news conference, Fine declined to state a precise price for
the buyout, but said speculation that it was about $500 million
``is in the ballpark.'' A&amp;M had sales of about $300 million last
year.
   A&amp;M, one of the last privately held major labels, has a talent
roster headed by Janet Jackson, Sting, Toni Childs, Joe Jackson, Al
Green, Brenda Russell, Human League and Suzanne Vega.
   Alpert and Moss, who used their initials to name the company,
founded it in 1962 in the garage of Alpert's home in a Los Angeles
suburb.
   Alpert told reporters he was ``excited about this situation''
and that it would give A&amp;M ``more visibility and more muscle''
competing for new talent.
   ``I think it's the right move at the right time,'' he said.
   PolyGram has been interested in expanding in the United States,
Fine said. Earlier this year it acquired Island Records Ltd., which
specializes in rap and reggae music, for an estimated $300 million.
   PolyGram already distributes A&amp;M records in Europe; RCA records
is the label's American distributor.
   PolyGram, 90 percent owned by Dutch electronics giant NV
Philips, bought Island Records in August for around $300 million.
PolyGram's artists include Bon Jovi, Fine Young Cannibals, U2,
Andrew Lloyd Webber and Luciano Pavarotti.
   As in many other areas of the entertainment business, there has
been consolidation in the records business in the past few years.
   The industry leader, Warner Records is being sold to Time Inc.
along with the rest of Warner Communications Inc

<HEAD>European Airlines Forge Ties To Form Mega-Carriers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Europe's airlines are rushing to join forces and
forge ties with American and Far Eastern counterparts in an attempt
to create mega-carriers in an increasingly global and competitive
industry.
   In addition, small airlines are springing up to challenge
Europe's heavyweight national airlines, and the governments that
own these big flag carriers are selling them gradually to private
investors.
   These developments represent a major restructuring of the air
travel industry on this side of the Atlantic. It's part of the
European Economic Community's attempt to to dismantle the old
airline system ahead of the end of 1992, when the 12-nation bloc
will become a trade barrier-free marketplace.
   But there are concerns that Europe's airlines may become too
concentrated and powerful because the number of carriers will be
reduced, hurting competition and ultimately the fare-paying
passenger.
   Some worry that Europe could be following the path of the
deregulated airline industry in the United States, where takeovers
and consolidation have reduced the number of competitors.
   The move by some leading European airlines to buy stakes in U.S.
airlines also has aroused controversy in the United States, where
such holdings are limited to 25 percent.
   The U.S. Department of Transportation has ordered KLM Royal
Dutch Airlines to cut its $400 million investment in Northwest
Airlines' parent company NWA Inc. to $176 million. Even though the
planned stake came to only 5 percent, the department said the
deal's size and structure might give KLM too much control.
   The department also might intervene in British Airways' proposal
to buy a 15 percent stake in United Airlines' parent UAL Corp. for
$750 million.
   ``There is radical change going on,'' said Stephen Clapham, a
European airlines analyst with the London investment firm Hoare
Govett Ltd. ``The general climate within Europe is one of an
increasing trend toward free market forces and the reduction of
government influence.''
   Hans Krakauer, deputy chairman of the International Airline
Passengers Association in London, said European airlines fear the
effect of liberalization on their own structure, and therefore are
looking at the idea of allying themselves with erstwhile
competitors.
   ``There is a certain fashion at the moment about joining up with
somebody,'' said Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland
Airways.
   The trend-setter is Scandinavian Airlines System, the first
airline to buy a stake in an American airline. A year ago it
acquired 10 percent of Texas Air Corp., parent of Continental and
Eastern airlines.
   SAS also holds a 25 percent stake in British Midland and
cooperation agreements with Japan's All Nippon Airways and
Thailand's Thai International. In addition, SAS plans to invest in
Swissair.
   British Airways, Europe's largest airline, was denationalized in
1987, and has teamed with United for two years under a joint
marketing agreement.
   BA also acquired smaller rival British Caledonian Airways nearly
two years ago and is seeking a joint stake with KLM in Sabena
Belgian World Airways. BA has attempted, but so far failed, to
obtain a stake in Air New Zealand.
   No. 2-ranked Lufthansa German Airlines and No. 3 Air France,
recently announced a wide-ranging cooperation agreement that
expands an existing relationship.
   They said they would cooperate on cargo, pilot training,
aircraft purchases, marketing, catering and duty free sales. They
also said they hope for a similar pact with Iberia International
Airlines of Spain.
   Swissair and Delta Air Lines, meanwhile, have bought 5 percent
stakes in each other.
   Not everybody is convinced that the airlines will benefit from
such ties, but there is a growing recognition among the European
carriers they are facing stiffer competition from overseas rivals,
in America and elsewhere.
   The carriers also fear that the EEC's 320 million people won't
be enough to sustain Europe's 21 major carriers, and that to grow,
they must expand abroad.
   In the past, it was governments that set routes, capacity and
fares in bilateral agreements which often acted as effective
cartels between any two given destinations.
   The European Commission, the EEC's governing body, has been
gradually relaxing these restrictions. This liberalization is
creating more choice and cheaper fares, but not fast enough, said
Krakauer, from the passengers group.
   A good example of deregulation's potential effects comes from
the London-Dublin route, controlled by British Airways and Aer
Lingus until 1986 when the governments allowed a new Irish carrier,
Ryanair, into the market.
   Today, six airlines ply the route and Ryanair, flying to Luton
Airport north of London, charges as little as 68 Irish pounds or
about $96 for a round-trip, compared with 121 pounds or $171 on Aer
Lingus, which has more daily flights and lands at London's Heathrow
Airport.
   Ryanair is still losing money, but there has been a jump in
passenger traffic through Dublin Airport from 2.9 million in 1986
to an estimated 5 million this year.
   By linking up, the airlines want to channel passengers to each
other, reduce costs and gain access to crucial computer
reservations systems, which are expensive and are operated mainly
by the large airlines.
   All competitors are seeking more takeoff and landing slots at
airports, one of the most important keys to profitable routes.
Increased traffic has strained airport capacity and Europe's
complex air control system.
   Staff shortages, outmoded equipment and strikes by air traffic
controllers have turned summer travel into a regular ordeal for
Europeans, and experts say the only solution is to integrate
Europe's 22 different national air control systems into one
sprawling network.
   The major European airlines carried nearly 63 million passengers
on scheduled European flights in 1988, up nearly 7 percent from the
previous year, while 75 smaller European carriers offer scheduled
international services, up from 20 in 1978, the Brussels-based
Association of European Airlines said.
   Smaller airlines are linking up with bigger ones to defend their
routes.
   ``The small fellows are going to have to become the tail end of
the big ones or come up with some brilliant commercial idea on how
to stay in existence in this competition,'' Krakauer said.
   What worries some Europeans is the possible anti-competitive
effect of joint agreements, particularly among dominant carriers,
which the European Commission is reviewing.
   ``I could see big airlines preventing others from using the big
airports, or preventing newcomers from having access to airports or
access to computer reservations systems,'' said Avishai Gil, a
transportation industry specialist with the International Labor
Organization, a Geneva-based United Nations agency.
   ``It really depends on the governments,'' Gil said. ``Nobody
knows how things will go.''
   British Midland's Bishop said: ``It's very important that the
consequences of deregulation in America are not repeated in Europe,
which is a consolidation of the airlines, which is not necessarily
in the interest of consumers.''

   Share prices closed unchanged Wednesday largely
with the help of gains in key blue chip stocks rather than any
change in sentiment over high British interest rates and a weak
sterling.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended at
2,218.8, unchanged from Tuesday's close, but sharply off its
session high of 2,232.5.
   The key index rebounded late in the session from the day's low
of 2,215.9 on what dealers said was some short-covering, but mostly
a lack of fresh selling ahead of a potentially market-affecting
speech by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson on
Thursday.
   Short-covering is the buying of stock to fulfill previous
agreements to sell it.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended 0.6 points lower at
1,797.3. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 1.52 points to
close at 1,232.37.
   Volume was a modest 503.2 million shares, down from 518.8
million shares on Tuesday when London posted steep declines on
interest rate jitters.

   Hundreds of lady beetles and wasps have been
imported from the Soviet Union by the Agriculture Department to
help American farmers battle the Russian wheat aphid.
   The predator insects are natural enemies of the aphid, and after
evaluation may be used in field tests against the destructive pests.
   Such biological controls are being sought by USDA scientists as
helpmates or even complete replacements for chemical pesticides.
The chemicals are not only costly for farmers but can threaten food
crops and the environment when used improperly.
   In all, three species of wasps and four species of lady beetles
were collected during May and June in the southern region of the
Soviet Union, the department's Agricultural Research Service
reported Tuesday.
   Actual collecting of the hundreds of specimens was done by
insect pathologist Tadeusz Poprawski and entomologist Francis
Gruber, who work for the agency's parasite laboratory in Behoust,
France.
   During their explorations, Poprawski and Gruber were based at a
new Soviet-American biological control laboratory in Kishinev,
Moldavia. The insects were sent to a USDA laboratory in Newark,
Del., for quarantine, rearing of new generations and distribution.
   The department's Richard S. Soper said in a statement that the
wasps and beetles ``are the first exchanges of biological pest
controls to come from recent USDA research agreements with the
Soviet Union.''
   Soper coordinates research on biological pest controls for the
USDA agency in Beltsville, Md. He left on Monday for the Soviet
Union to help plan next year's joint studies and explorations.
   The Russian wheat aphid, first spotted in the United States in
1986 in Texas, has spread to 16 states in just three years,
damaging wheat, barley, rye and oats. Aphids were said to cost
farmers an estimated $123 million last ear in grain losses and
chemical controls.
   Officials said two species of Soviet wasps were sent in August
to a USDA research unit in Stillwater, Okla., for evaluation with
other wasps from Turkey, Syria, Jordan and France to determine the
best candidates for field tests.
   Some other wasps were shipped to the department's ``mass-rearing
facility'' in Mission, Texas, to produce more specimens. And the
lady beetles are being ``multiplied'' in Niles, Mich. Research on
the beetles will be done at the agency's facility in Brookings, S.D.

   The meat business may be headed for better
times if current indications prove out, says an industry spokesman.
   C. Manly Molpus, president of the American Meat Institute, said
the overall decline in red meat consumption appears to have
stabilized over the last year or so. Further, he said, there are
``solid indications'' that demand for pork is increasing.
   ``Retail beef prices have responded to supply shortfalls with
more vigor than might have been expected after the flat-to-down
trend that characterized most of the decade'' of the 1980s, Molpus
said. ``And the export value of meat and meat products surpassed
the value of imports for the first time ever last year.''
   Molpus's comments were in the association's Meat Facts yearbook
for 1989, which was distributed Tuesday.
   ``Cattle numbers are at or near their cyclical low, and beef
supplies will remain tight for the next several years as producers
hold back cattle to expand herd sizes,'' he said. ``On the pork
side, poor producer returns have likely slowed herd expansion, with
the result that pork supplies could be slightly smaller next year.''

   Private exporting companies have sold the
Soviet Union an additional 150,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean meal
for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement.
   The latest sales pushed U.S. soybean meal purchases by Moscow to
250,000 tons for 1989-90, the Agriculture Department said Tuesday.
   In addition, since the new delivery year began on Oct. 1 the
Soviet Union has bought 3.7 million tons of corn under the
agreement. No wheat has yet been sold for 1989-90 delivery, however.
   U.S. grain sales to Moscow in 1988-89 were a record of more than
21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn
and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat.
   In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans,
1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain
sorghums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels
of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans.
   No prices or further details were announced, but the 150,000
tons of soybean meal could have a value of around $30 million,
based on recent prices quoted at U.S. processing plants.

   Stock prices lapsed into a broad decline today,
continuing the pullback that began in Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 on Tuesday,
dropped 24.06 points to 2,761.27 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 370 up,
1,025 down and 511 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to
cash in their gains after the market's rise to record highs last
week and Monday.
   The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a
dimming of hopes for any moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy.
   Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes
of some stimulus from the Fed, were mixed in today's credit-market
activity.
   In addition, the Bank of Japan raised its influential discount
rate from 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent.
   AMR dropped 2{ to 98~ in active trading on word that the company
was asking for legislation to help it ward off a takeover bid by
investor Donald Trump.
   Ramada Inc. fell 2[ to 11[. The company said it wasn't

   Barbara Jackle and her husband say they lucked out by finding a
reliable woman who could watch their son for $85 a week, though
they had to make special arrangements for him to attend school near
the care-giver's home miles away.
   ``And that's good for only one year,'' said Mrs. Jackle, 37, a
librarian who lives in Upper Darby, Pa., near Philadelphia. ``We're
even contemplating the possibility of moving, so we could be closer
to where she is.''
   The scramble by the Jackles to find a trustworthy sitter for
their 5-year-old reflects the growth in two-income families among
the baby-boom generation, which in turn has created an enormous
problem for working parents nationwide _ caring for their kids and
paying for it.
   ``Nowadays, it seems if you're going to need care you'd better
get set up before you get pregnant,'' said Louise Hurst, a licensed
day-care professional who watches the Jackle boy and five other
small children in her home.
   ``I've gotten lots of calls,'' said Mrs. Hurst, 43. ``I inform
them I'm full until September 1991, so I don't even bother to take
a waiting list.''
   Demand for child care has grown so fast that costs have
multiplied, in some cases nearly consuming the money earned from a
second income.
   This has crimped budgets of millions of Americans, created an
underground cash economy of unregulated care-givers, and forced
many companies to offer allowances ranging from flexible work
schedules to emergency sitters to attract or retain valued
employees.
   Some prominent employers have gone further, allowing young
mothers and fathers to work at home or take years off with full
benefits and job guarantees. Others are building in-house day-care
centers, hiring roving nannies or subsidizing the cost of care with
cash payments.
   ``Certainly it's fashionable these days for corporations to get
into this,'' said Antony Ward, director of Child Care Inc., a New
York referral service retained by many companies to assist
employees in finding help.
   ``A lot of people viscerally respond to the child-care issue,''
he said. ``Anyone who takes the kid to the family day-care provider
to find a note on the door saying, `I have the flu,' knows what
it's like.''
   First Bank System of St. Paul, Minn., for example, has donated
space in its office this year for a public kindergarten that
doubles as an after-school day-care center, with priority given to
children of bank employees. NCNB Corp., a fast-growing bank in
Charlotte, N.C., plans to offer up to a 50 percent reimbursement of
child-care costs to many of its workers.
   Pitney Bowes Inc., a leading maker of business machines in
Stamford, Conn., helped pioneer flexible working hours to
accommodate working parents, allowing them to arrive early some
days and leave early on others. Federal Express Corp., the Memphis,
Tenn., overnight delivery service, offers working parents four-day
weeks and 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. shifts.
   Last month, seven large New York-based employers announced a
pilot program of emergency child care for workers whose usual
arrangements have been disrupted. The program is aimed at reducing
absenteeism.
   ``Companies are finding that if they're not family friendly,
they're losing employees,'' said Lorraine Dusky, a free-lance
writer who co-authored ``The Best Companies for Women,'' a
guidebook to 50 leading American corporations. ``Companies aren't
doing this to be altruistic. If companies don't do something, we're
in trouble.''
   Nonetheless, the high-profile benefits of a relatively few
companies mask what critics call a deepening crisis in a labor pool
comprised increasingly of women, historically the primary family
care-givers.
   Child-care activists say the majority of businesses will not
concede that it's a a work-related issue, despite evidence that
employer assistance leads to lower turnover, higher employee morale
and improved productivity. Moreover, they say the federal
government isn't providing much help.
   Although a bill that would vastly expand federal support for
child care is working through Congress, it faces the possibility of
a White House veto because of the estimated $22.7 billion cost over
the next five years.
   President Bush has proposed more modest legislation that would
cost $2.5 billion a year by 1993, mostly through tax credits.
Still, that's less than $20 a week or about $1,000 a year, and
would only go to lower-income families.
   By contrast, out-of-home, child-care costs can range from $1,500
to $10,000 a year, the Conference Board business research group
said in a study. Other studies have shown in-home costs can go much
higher.
   ``We have a system that has not caught up with rapid social
change in our society, in which more women are back in the labor
force and need child care,'' said Esther J. Kahn, director of
Parent's Place, a San Francisco counseling and referral service.
``Our society hasn't provided support for families.''
   A study for the Labor Department by the Hudson Institute, an
Indianapolis research organization, shows women now comprise nearly
half the work force, compared with 38.1 percent in 1970 and 29.6
percent in 1950.
   Other Labor Department figures show 57 percent of all women with
children under 6 work outside the home, vs. 12 percent in 1950. A
study by the Children's Defense Fund, a Washington-based
child-advocacy group, predicts two-thirds of all preschool children
will have mothers in the work force by 1995.
   ``Only 7 percent of American households now fit the Beaver
Cleaver family's mold of breadwinning father and at-home mother,''
says a policy paper by the Child Care Action Campaign, a New York
coalition that advocates a national system of care. ``As female
labor force participation rates continue to climb, the demand for
child care will grow, too.''

   The vast majority of working parents must contend with a
hodge-podge, hit-or-miss system for finding help they can trust and
afford. Stories abound of care-givers and sitters who ignore,
abandon, abuse or kidnap children.
   In a case that gained nationwide attention last March, a
Chattanooga, Tenn., sitter was sentenced to a year in jail after
the parents of a 6-year-old boy secretly videotaped her viciously
slapping their child. In August, a day-care provider near Hartford,
Conn., was arrested after a 3-year-old child died in the woman's
locked car, evidently from heat stroke.
   A recent article in Child magazine offered tips on how to avoid
``babysitters from hell.''
   Many working parents rely on referrals from friends and
relatives to hire help, but the result often is an unlicensed,
untrained care-giver who can range from a total stranger to the
grandmotherly widow down the block.
   For the Jackles and other clients of Mrs. Hurst, who found her
by word-of-mouth, the main attractions included her state license
to practice in-home day care, her acceptance of payment by check,
her willingness to keep children until 7 p.m. and her $85 weekly
bill, which includes food. But perhaps the biggest draw of all was
Mrs. Hurst's reliability.
   ``We have friends who have gone through sitters every other
week,'' said Mrs. Jackle, who had taken time off to raise her son
for the first few years. ``For a while I wasn't sure I was going
back to work or not.''
   The day-care dilemma has been compounded by the practice of many
care-givers to take cash only, so they don't have to report the
income on their tax returns. An estimated $7 billion in day-care
income goes unreported annually.
   This year for the first time, parents must provide the name and
social security number of their day-care provider to the Internal
Revenue Service to qualify for a tax credit to defray part of the
cost. The IRS plans to use the information to cross-reference the
returns of providers and prosecute cheaters.
   Day-care experts believe the law could make it even harder for
parents to afford day care, since many providers will raise their
rates to compensate for having to pay tax.
   ``It's a situation where the government hasn't helped parents on
child care very much at all,'' said Judsen Culbreth, editor of
Working Mother magazine. ``Now they're making it even harder.''
   Barbara Reisman, executive director of the Child Care Action
Campaign, also criticized the tax crackdown.
   ``Child-care workers are the lowest paid workers in this
country. One of the ways people are able to survive are to be paid
without having to declare the income,'' she said.
   ``I don't recommend people cheat on their taxes,'' she said.
``But many parents can't afford to pay the full cost of care. This
doesn't address the real problem.''

   Trygve Haavelmo, a Norwegian professor
who dislikes awards for academics, won the Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Science on Wednesday for using statistics and probability
to forecast how economies behave.
   Haavelmo ``had a swift and pathbreaking influence'' on the new
science of econometrics with his probability theory, the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the award.
   ``I am honored. Anyone would be. But I had nothing to do with
making this award. I really have nothing to say,'' said Haavelmo,
77, in an interview.
   The prize ``is quite irrelevant to the real issues. I'm
exhausted and I have nothing more to say,'' he added.
   Haavelmo, who still works part time at the University of Oslo,
has privately voiced disdain for academic prizes, colleagues said.
Tore Thornstad, a co-worker at the university, described Haavelmo
as a shy, reserved person who prefers research and teaching to
being in the limelight.
   In his 1941 doctoral dissertation for Harvard University,
Haavelmo pioneered the field of econometrics, which introduced
statistical probability to economic testing and forecasting.
   The thesis was published in 1944. Ten years later he published a
book of his research on economic development theory.
   The Academy of Sciences said in its citation that Haavelmo was
awarded the $469,000 prize ``for his clarification of the
probability theory foundations of econometrics and his analyses of
simultaneous economic structures.''
   Assar Lindbeck, head of the academy's prize committee and a
personal friend of Haavelmo, called him ``the father of modern
econometrics'' and a dominant figure in post-war economic theories.
   ``As soon as you take a serious report in your hand or a
long-term projection, it is econometrics that charts the
relationship between all quantitative economic analyses,'' Lindbeck
told reporters.
   Haavelmo was the second Norwegian to win the economics prize
since it was introduced in 1969 by the Bank of Sweden and added to
the five other Nobel prizes. Ragnar Frisch, who once employed
Haavelmo as a a research assistant, won the prize in its inaugural
year.
   Haavelmo is a member of the American Economic Association and
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
   He was born Dec. 13, 1911 in the town of Skedsmo a few miles
east of Oslo, the son of a school administrator. He graduated from
the University of Oslo in 1933.
   He moved to the United States in 1939, at the outbreak of World
War II, on a Rockefeller grant and worked at the University of
Chicago and later in New York with the Norwegian Trade Ministry.
   Haavelmo's doctoral thesis won him immediate recognition. A
think tank of young economic scientists from several nationalities,
the Cowles Commission, was created to pursue the ideas he raised
and other theories.
   Haavelmo returned to Norway in 1947 and became professor of
economics at the University of Oslo.
   ``I see Haavelmo as an original thinker but one who always kept
his theories relevant to the real world,'' said Thorvald Moe, a
senior official of the Norwegian Finance Ministry.
   According to his sister-in-law, Mrs. Margit Haavelmo, he never
married and his only brother died five years ago. ``He is a very
well-liked man,'' Mrs. Haavelmo said in a telephone interview.
   Roedseth, director of Oslo University's Social Economics
Institute, said Haavelmo usually comes in to work several times a
week, although he went on full pension 10 years ago.

<HEAD>Gannett 3rd Quarter Earnings up 17 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. said Thursday that lower
newsprint costs and improved cost controls at its USA Today
newspaper helped the communications concern boost its third-quarter
profit 11 percent.
   After-tax profit for the three-month period that ended Sept. 24
totaled $83.1 million, or 52 cents a share, compared with $75.1
million, or 47 cents a share, for the same period in 1988.
   Third-quarter operating revenue grew by 3 percent to $827.9
million from $804.3 million.
   In a letter to shareholders, John J. Curley, Gannett's chairman
and president, said the third-quarter figures reflected ``lower
newsprint costs and a substantial improvement in the results of USA
Today,'' Gannett's national newspaper, through ``effective cost
controls.''
   For the first nine months of 1989, profits were up 11 percent to
$270.1 million _ or $1.68 per share _ compared with $246.6 million
_ or $1.52 per share _ for the same period of 1988.
   Revenue for the first nine months totaled $2.5 billion, up
nearly 6 percent from $2.4 billion in the same period last year.
   Rosslyn, Va.-based Gannett operates in 41 states, the District
of Columbia and seven overseas locations. The news and information
giant publishes 83 daily newspapers, operates 10 television
stations, 16 radio stations, Gannett News Services and the largest
outdoor advertising company in North America.
   Operating income advanced 7 percent to $166 million in the third
period compared with $155.6 million in the third quarter a year ago.
   While newspaper advertising circulation revenues increased 3
percent for the quarter, run-of-page newspaper linage was off due
to a drop in retail and national advertising.
   USA Today's paid advertising pages totaled 785, down from the
865 for the same period last year when the Summer Olympics boosted
summer ad demand, the company reported.
   For the year to date, paid advertising pages totaled 2,735, down
from 2,847 for the same nine-month period in 1988.
   Because of rate adjustments and a higher rate base, USA Today's
advertising revenue climbed 8 percent for the third quarter and 13
percent for the year to date, said Gannett.
   Gannett said its third-quarter broadcasting revenue of $89.62
million was nearly the same as the $89.7 million for the same
period in 1988.

   Most soybean and corn futures prices closed
slightly higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders
fine-tuned their positions in preparation for Thursday's
Agriculture Department crop report.
   Wheat futures posted modest losses, reflecting a lack of new
export demand.
   The USDA crop report, scheduled for release after Thursday's
close, is expected to indicate slightly larger corn and soybean
harvests than the USDA's September estimates of 1.89 billion
bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn.
   A survey of private crop analysts taken earlier this week showed
estimates averaging 1.92 billion bushels of soybeans and 7.4
billion bushels of corn.
   But estimates released late Tuesday by respected private crop
analyst Conrad Leslie came in slightly below those averages,
prompting some buying of futures this morning.
   Analysts also attributed Wednesday's modest rally to buying
inspired by the soybean market's tumble to 23-month lows on Tuesday.
   ``The markets have really gotten battered around and were
oversold,'' said Joel Karlin, an analyst in Chicago with Research
Department Inc., which provides research services to brokers.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 2{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.04{ a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to 1} cents higher with December at $2.35 a
bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with December at

November at $5.52 a bushel.

<HEAD>Chase Posts $1.12 Billion Loss As Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chase Manhattan Corp. reported Wednesday that it lost $1.12
billion in the third quarter, in line with projections made a month
ago when it decided to substantially boost its loan-loss reserves
to cover problem Third World debt.
   The loss for the three months ended Sept. 30 amounted to $12.45
a share, compared with a profit of $283 million, or $3.09 a share,
recorded the same period a year ago.
   Excluding the higher reserves, as well as other special
provisions taken in the third quarter, Chase said it would have
earned $151 million, or $1.45 a share. It said its 1988 third
quarter earnings, would have totaled $130 million, or $1.32 a
share, minus special gains from income tax benefits and its pension
plan.
   Chase said this year's third quarter included increases in net
interest income, consumer and investment banking fees and trading
account income. Income from foreign exchange trading declined from
the year-earlier quarter.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Chase's net loss totaled $840
million, or $10.01 per share, compared with net income of $784
million, or $8.62 per share a year earlier. Excluding the impact of
the special provisions, Chase would have netted $420 million, or
$4.04 a share.
   Chase, the nation's second-largest banking company after
Citicorp, with assets of around $106 billion, had said it expected
to lose $1.12 billion in the third quarter of this year when it
announced a major recapitalization plan on Sept. 20.
   The plan, which resulted in a total after-tax charge of $1.26
billion, included the addition of $1.15 billion to its loan-loss
reserves for Third World debt, an $85 million charge reflecting the
lower value of problem real estate assets in Chase's Arizona
banking subsidiary and a $25 million charge relating to securities
trading activities.
   Chase had also said it would issue $500 million in new common
stock.
   Two other major New York banks, J.P. Morgan &amp; Co. and
Manufacturers Hanover Corp., also sharply boosted their loan-loss
reserves last month. The moves reflected a growing realization
among bankers that the money lent to Third World countries in the
1970s to spur economic growth may never be fully repaid.
   Manufacturers Hanover added $950 million to its reserves in the
third quarter for a projected $775 million loss, while Morgan
raised reserves by $2 billion and said it expected a $1.8 billion
quarterly loss.
   Chase said its reserve for possible credit losses from Third
World countries totaled $2.9 billion the end of the third quarter,
or roughly 46 percent of Chase's total $6.2 billion of medium- and
long-term loans to Third World countries.
   The ratio was 24 percent at the end of the 1988 third quarter,
when reserves were $1.9 billion.

   Stock prices showed a broad loss today,
continuing the pullback that began in Tuesday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 on Tuesday,
dropped 20.78 points to 2,764.55 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 391 up,
1,078 down and 473 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders increasingly yielded to the temptation to
cash in their gains after the market's rise to record highs last
week and Monday.
   The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a
dimming of hopes for any moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy.
   Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes
of some stimulus from the Fed, were mixed in today's credit-market
activity.
   In addition, the Bank of Japan raised its influential discount

<HEAD>Court Rejects GSU Move To Include Costs In Rates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attempt by Gulf States Utilities Co.
to make customers pay $1.4 billion of the costs of the River Bend
nuclear power plant was rejected Wednesday by a state judge.
   District Judge Paul Landry backed a contention by the Public
Service Commission that the costs were imprudent and should not be
passed on to customers in their electric rates.
   However, Landry's order left open the possibility of the costs
being brought into the rate structure by the PSC in the future. The
PSC had argued that Gulf States should have built a less expensive
electric generating plant fueled by lignite coal.
   The decision sent the company's stock reeling. In late afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Gulf States Utilities was
the most active issue and tumbled $2.50 a share to $11.75.
   Tom Phillips, an attorney for Gulf States, said he would review
the decision before deciding whether to appeal.
   Landry rejected a motion by state Attorney General William Guste
to disallow all costs associated with River Bend from the rate
base. The commission earlier agreed to allow Gulf States to include
$1.6 billion in costs from the plant.
   ``In my opinion, this defeats the entire purpose of
regulation,'' said Assistant Attorney General Dave McNeill. ``For
the next who knows how many years, the $1.4 billion hangs over the
heads of the rate payers ...''
   But PSC member Louis Lambert said the decision means rate payers
``won't be charged for $1.4 billion of River Bend nuclear plant
because the court held that GSU had enough information at the time
to know they should have built a lignite coal unit.''
   The long-running dispute between Gulf States and the PSC stems
from the utility's decision in 1979 to proceed with the
construction of River Bend, located near St. Francisville, La.
   Company officials said the decision was based upon the best
possible information about future electric needs in Louisiana and
the type of fuel that should be used to generate power.
   The PSC contended that GSU continued with construction plans
only to recoup its costs after a buyer could not be found for the
$4.5 billion project. The plant began commercial operation in 1986.
Cajun Electric Power Cooperative shared in the construction costs.
   Gulf States serves about 500,000 customers in Louisiana and
southeastern Texas.

   Energy futures prices closed mostly higher
Wednesday as technical factors dominated the session.
   The November contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, rose 8 cents to settle at $20.25 a
42-gallon barrel in New York Mercantile Exchange trading following
a 15 cent gain on Tuesday.
   There was no fundamental news to influence trading, said Richard
Kane, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. He described
volume as light to moderate.
   November West Texas Intermediate moved as high as $20.40 a
barrel, but when the contract failed to gain further ground, some
traders decided to take profits late in the day, Kane said.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
the November contract for wholesale unleaded gasoine fell 0.26 cent
to 55.73 cents a gallon, but subsequent contract months moved
higher. On Tuesday, the November gasoline contract picked up a full
cent.
   Kane also attributed gasoline's performance to technical factors.
   Home heating oil for November delivery rose 0.17 cent to settle
at 59.81 cents a gallon after rising 0.87 cent the previous session.

   The dollar gained more ground Wednesday against
most major foreign currencies despite heavy selling by central
banks and a surprise hike in the Japanese discount rate.
   Gold prices rose after falling slightly overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $362 a troy ounce, a $1 increase from Tuesday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$361.50 an ounce, up 50 cents.
   Currency dealers said the dollar initially fell after the Bank
of Japan announced it would hike its discount rate _ the interest
rate charged to member banks _ to 3.75 percent from 3.25 percent.
   But the dollar soon shrugged off that unexpected news as well as
reports of widespread intervention by the Federal Reserve, the Bank
of Japan and several European central banks, they said.
   ``All rabbits have been pulled out of the hat and the dollar
still isn't going down,'' said a senior dealer at a U.S. investment
bank in London.
   Another European dealer said the central bank dollar-selling was
effective only in ``taking the sting out of what looked to be a
fairly vicious upward move.''
   J. Thomas Stanley, manager of corporate foreign exchange for
Chemical New York Capital Markets Group, said the dollar was being
supported by the belief that U.S. interest rates would hold steady.
   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted during a meeting in Moscow on
Tuesday that rates would stay firm in the near term regardless of
the currency's movements. He expressed concern that ``attempts to
maintain unrealistic exchange rates may lead to destabilizing
international capital flows ...''
   Those remarks helped push the dollar sharply higher in Tuesday
trading, since firmer interest rates tend to support a currency.
   Stanley predicted that ``without a rate cut by the Fed ... the
dollar is not going to come off.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose 1.67 yen from Monday to close at 143.90
yen. Tokyo's markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday.
The yen was quoted at 144.50 yen in London, and 144.50 yen in New
York, unchanged.
   The British pound continued to lose ground against the dollar.
It cost $1.5425 for one pound in London, cheaper than $1.5580 late
Tuesday. Sterling fetched $1.5460 in New York, down from $1.5520.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.9155 West German marks, up from 1.9083; 6.4900
French francs, up from 6.4655; 1.6800 Swiss francs, up from 1.6670;
1.17475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17625; and 1,402.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,394.875.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's rates,
included: 1.9185 West German marks, up from 1.8965; 1.6785 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6545; 6.4925 French francs, up from 6.4300;
2.1630 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1290; 1.1750 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1735; and 1,403.25 Italian lire, up from 1,382.40.
   Gold fell in London to $361.25 an ounce from late Tuesday's
$362. In Zurich, gold closed at $361.50 an ounce, down from $362.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 0.72 cents to close at $362.36
an ounce.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery rose to $5.076 a troy ounce from $5.03
Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $5.05 an ounce from $5.06.

   CalFed Inc., parent of the nation's

property casualty business by selling its London-based Anglo
American Insurance Co. Ltd.
   Anglo American is being purchased by an affiliate of John Head &amp;

   CalFed, which spent $80 million to set up Anglo American in
April 1987, said it expects the insurer to earn about $9 million in
1989 compared to $3.9 million in 1988.
   CalFed, whose principle subsidiary is the big California Federal
Bank savings and loan, announced in January that it had sold CalFed
Insurance Syndicate Inc., its other property-casualty insurance
subsidiary.

<HEAD>Fall 11 Percent in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. reported a 11 percent decline in
third-quarter earnings Wednesday, primarily because a severe drop
in income from joint ventures offset gains in television
advertising.
   The network said it earned $61.8 million or $2.40 a share in the
three months ended Sept. 30, compared with $69.8 million or $2.72 a
share in the year-earlier period. Third-quarter sales totaled
$593.5 million vs. $568 million, a 4 percent increase.
   CBS attributed most of the earnings drop to an 82.6 percent
decline in third-quarter income from CBS-Fox, a joint venture
between CBS and Twentieth Century Fox that markets and distributes
home videcassettes. CBS said it earned $1.2 million from the joint
venture in the period, vs. $6.9 million a year ago.
   President and Chief Executive Officer Laurence A. Tisch said
that despite the decline, the company's key television operations
were performing well, helped by gains in ad income, no unusual
disruptions to the fall season, and lower costs from the absence of
presidential campaign coverage this year.
   ``With a robust advertising market and better ratings over last
year's strike-disrupted program schedule, the Television Network is
expected to show imrpoved results for the balance of the year,''
Tisch said.
   For the first nine months of 1989, CBS said it earned $236.9
million or $9.21 a share, a 3 percent decline from the $243.3
million or $9.46 million a share earned in the year-earlier period.
Sales totaled $2.1 billion vs. $2.0 billion, a 5 percent increase.
   If discontinued operations from 1988 are included in the
figures, earnings for the first nine months of 1989 would have
fallen 79 percent from a year earlier, when company earnings were
inflated by $866.6 million from the sale of its records subsidiary
to Sony Corp.

   When you have an airline for sale, who do you
call? Don't ask Carl Icahn.
   Icahn, the takeover specialist who completed his $1.2 billion
buyout of Trans World Airlines Inc. last year, has been rumored for
several months to be looking to unload the airline through a sale
or merger or another kind of management change.
   TWA employees have heard through the grapevine that Icahn has
talked with other major airlines, other takeover experts, even St.
Louis-based corporate giants Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. and McDonnell
Douglas Corp.
   The brewer and the aircraft maker often are approached to help
bail out local companies and institutions. TWA could fit nicely
with McDonnell Douglas, the world's second-largest builder of
commercial jets after Boeing Co.
   Icahn also had expressed interest some months ago in strikebound
Eastern Airlines, hinting at a possible merger between Eastern and
TWA.
   The latest speculation comes against a background of takeover
fever sweeping the nation's airline industry. An investor group
recently acquired Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc. for $3.65
billion, while a pilot-management coalition is trying to buy UAL
Corp., United Airlines' parent, for $6.75 billion. Just last week,
developer Donald Trump made a record $7 billion offer for AMR
Corp., which owns American Airlines _ the nation's largest and most
profitable.
   Mark Buckstein, TWA's general counsel at its corporate
headquarters in Mt. Kisco, N.Y., declined comment Wednesday on the
rumors concerning Icahn.
   ``No Mr. Right has come out of the woodwork,'' said Morten
Beyer, chairman of Avmark Inc., an aviation consulting firm based
in Arlington, Va. ``I would say there certainly hasn't been a
stampede to buy TWA.''
   But Beyer and other analysts said it's clear that something
needs to be done to help TWA, which began this decade as the
nation's second-largest airline and is now near the bottom of the
list of majors.
   Will TWA end up as part of an airline merger?
   Mark Daugherty, an airline analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in New York, said he doesn't think so.
   ``I don't think the government would allow it,'' Daugherty said.
``The USAir-Piedmont merger barely squeaked by and I don't see a
TWA merger with a major carrier making it.''
   If it's not another airline, then it's anybody's guess what will
happen.
   TWA workers are just hoping something happens soon. The waiting
is becoming unbearable, said Herb Johnson, president of the
Machinists union's Local 1650.
   ``It's a tremendous amount of stress on our people. The anxiety
is growing,'' said Johnson, who's based in Kansas City, Mo., where
TWA has a large maintenance facility.
   ``Our people are trying to plan vacations, or trying to figure
out whether to buy a new car, just like everyone else in America,''
Johnson said. ``But we can't do anything because we don't know if
we'll have a job when we wake up.''
   The rumors have been passed around the workplace for so long, he
said, that nobody knows what to expect.
   ``It's really become a joke,'' Johnson said.
   Analysts say several major problems have contributed to the
decline of TWA and are probably also keeping suitors from rushing
to buy the airline.
   Chief among the troubles are financial woes.
   Through the first half of the year, TWA reported losses of $87.5
million, while many of the nation's other major carriers have been
posting record profits.
   The company, which Icahn took private last October, also has to
repay $400 million in interest payments this year and has $1.7
billion in principal and interest payments coming due in later
years.
   The airline also has a fairly dissatisfied workforce.
   Johnson said TWA aircraft mechanics haven't received a raise in
five years, while ticket agents and reservation clerks are being
paid the same amount they were in 1980.
   The 16,000 TWA employees in the Machinists union have been
working under a contract that expired last October. The airline's
pilots, among the lowest paid among major carriers, are continuing
a lawsuit challenging the manner in which Icahn took the company
private.
   The pilots lost the suit in New York Supreme Court and have
appealed that decision, according to David Berkeley, a spokesman
for the TWA pilots.
   Another big concern is the age of TWA's fleet, the second-oldest
among major U.S. carriers. The company has ordered 40 new planes
from Europe's Airbus Industrie, but the first shipment of 20 of
those jets won't be ready until 1994.

<HEAD>Unisys Introduces Two Imaging Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. entered the emerging market
of digital image processing Wednesday with two systems that will
allow crisp images of checks and blueprints to be stored
electronically.
   The company's Image Item Processing System will be available in
the first quarter of 1990 for an average of $1.5 million to $3
million. Combined with the software Image Check Processing System,
it will allow high-speed image processing of payment items for the
banking industry.
   The Unisys InfoImage Engineering Document Management System,
available now starting at $500,000, allows storage of such
documents as blueprints, engineering drawings, charts and building
diagrams. Software permits the digitized documents to be indexed
and called up onto display work stations along with data in other
computer systems.
   ``Unisys is committed to a leadership role in the imaging
revolution, which will produce more than $5 billion in revenue by
1992, up from $800 million in 1988,'' said L.W. ``Roy'' Beers, vice
president for document imaging systems.
   Dennis P. Farkas, vice president for financial and imaging
programs, said imaging allows banks to reduce the repeated physical
handling of paper items, which leads to processing errors.
   Savings in labor and other costs will pay for the system in
about three years, he said.
   ``We're looking at this as a major growth area for the
company,'' he said.
   Unisys expects to capture 40 percent to 45 percent of a
projected $2.3 billion payment-item processing market by 1993, of
which $1.2 billion will be in imaging, he said.
   Unisys currently has about a 25 percent share of the $850
million traditional processing market worldwide, he said.
   Chase Manhattan Bank, Huntington Bancshares Inc. of Columbus,
Ohio, and The Northern Trust Co. of Chicago have announced plans to
use the check-processing system, Unisys said.
   Rolls-Royce and Associates Ltd. of Britain, the high-technology
defense contracting subsidiary of Rolls-Royce PLC, will use the
document system.
   Unisys said last month it had formed a corporate office for
imaging systems to coordinate a comprehensive strategic commitment
to document and payment imaging systems. It said technology had
progressed to the point where imaging systems could generate fast
payback and cost savings to a broad range of users.
   In recent weeks, Unisys also announced a series of strategic
relationships with industry-leading image technology vendors to
integrate their innovative technology into Unisys information
management systems.

   Stock prices declined for the second straight
session Wednesday in selling attributed to new interest-rate
worries and uneasiness about prospects for several pending and
rumored buyouts.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 6.08 Tuesday,
dropped another 11.97 points to 2,773.36.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
458 up, 1,021 down and 504 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders found it hard to resist the temptation to
cash in their gains after the market's rise to record highs last
week and Monday.
   The tendency to lighten up was apparently heightened by a
dimming of hopes for any moves soon by the Federal Reserve to relax
its credit policy.
   Interest rates, which had been dropping in recent days on hopes
of some stimulus from the Fed, rose in Wednesday's credit-market
activity.
   Prices of long-term government bonds dropped about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, lifting their yields to the 8.05 percent-8.10
percent range.
   In addition, the Bank of Japan raised its influential discount
rate from 3.25 percent to 3.75 percent.
   On the mergers and acquisitions front, AMR dropped 4\ to 97[ in
active trading on word that the company was asking for legislation
to help it ward off a takeover bid by investor Donald Trump.
   Among other airline stocks, USAir Group lost 2| to 46{ and Delta
Air Lines was down 2| at 77[.
   Ramada Inc. fell 2\ to 11. The company said it was taking off
the market an offering of debt securities that had been planned as
part of a restructuring program.
   Gulf States Utilities, the most active Big Board issue, tumbled
2[ to 12[. A Louisiana judge rejected the company's attempt to
include $1.4 billion in costs associated with a nuclear power plant
in its electric rates.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down \ at
45; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down { at 42{; International
Paper, down 1 at 54}, and International Business Machines, down {
at 107}.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.07 million
shares, up from 147.56 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 193.31 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $19.43 billion, or 0.55
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.19 to 197.81.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 2.33 to 407.40, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 2.14 at 356.99.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 1.98 to 482.16. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 395.68, down 1.35.

<HEAD>Third-Quarter Earnings Expected to Tumble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Third-quarter earnings for the nation's Big Three
automakers are expected to tumble from last year's levels,
primarily because of sales incentive costs, analysts say.
   On the balance sheet, incentive costs come directly out of North
American operations. General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. have
profitable overseas operations, especially in Europe, but Chrysler
Corp. doesn't.
   Consequently, Chrysler's earnings could take a big hit when the
Big Three report their earnings during the week of Oct. 23.
   Incentive costs, sometimes called marketing expenses, have been
heavy during the second and third quarters of 1989 for the Big
Three. Each embarked on extensive rebate and low-interest financing
programs as the second quarter began and continued them through the
third quarter, mostly to remove built up inventories before the
1990 model year began Oct. 1.
   ``You know what's a killer? Marketing expenses, which could be
as high as $1,000 a car,'' said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc. of New York City.
   Analysts estimates of third-quarter earnings vary greatly, but
each is significantly lower for each company compared to the same
three-month period a year ago. During the third quarter of 1988,
the Big Three earned a combined $1.83 billion, or $3.51 a share, to
post the best third quarter in history.
   This year, combined earnings should be somewhere around $1.02
billion, or about $1.95 a share, analysts figures show. That's down
44.3 percent.
   ``It's not going to be a pretty quarter,'' said analyst Douglas
Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York.
   He attributed nearly all the sour performance to North American
operations, as did independent analyst David Healy.
   ``I think chances are that a break even or loss in North
American operations will affect all three,'' Healy said.
   Even though incentives eat into profits, none of the Big Three
are shying away from them so far in the fourth quarter. GM, Ford
and Chrysler have offered rebates, low-interest financing or
specialized promotions nationwide and regionally for 1989 and 1990
cars.
   Some of the programs were introduced on 1990 vehicles even
before the cars and trucks officially went on sale.
   Less profitable North American operations affect not only the
balance sheet for the corporation but profit sharing for the
companies' workers. Each contract between a Big Three automaker and
the United Auto Workers union contains a formula for figuring
profit sharing checks for the workers.
   The amount of the check is directly related to the profitability
of a company's operations in North America.

<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. reported a 2.9
percent rise in earnings Wednesday for its third quarter, with
increased hotel profits offset by lower returns from casinos.
   Separately, spokesman William Lebo said several suitors had
signed confidentiality agreements to examine Hilton's books as the
corporation continues its ``slow and deliberate'' effort to sell
itself.
   For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Hilton said it earned
$28.1 million, or 58 cents per share, on revenues of $248.5
million. In the same period last year, Hilton earned $27.3 million,
or 57 cents per share, on revenues of $236.1 million.
   Hotel income for the period rose 36 percent to $28.5 million,
but was partially offset by $1.5 million in start-up costs at new
properties, Hilton said. Gaming income fell 10 percent to $29.7
million.
   Corporate expenses rose 79 percent to $10.4 million, mainly
because of unanticipated settlement costs relating to a property
deal in an earlier year, Hilton said.
   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Hilton said its earnings
fell 14 percent to $83.2 million, or $1.72 per share, from $95.7
million, or $1.99 a share, a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose
6 percent to $738.6 million from $699.2 million a year earlier.
   In August, after settlement of the contested will of founder
Conrad Hilton, the company put itself up for sale. Some analysts
estimated it could fetch more than $6 billion.
   Lebo declined to identify suitors or to say how many had entered
into confidentiality agreements.

<HEAD>Glazer Group Seeks Clearance To Increase Harley-Davidson Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group led by businessman Malcolm I. Glazer
said Wednesday it had requested federal permission to increase its
stake in the motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson Inc. to 15
percent.
   The investor group said in a statement issued at its Rochester,
N.Y. headquarters that it was still studying ``a full range of
options'' regarding its stake in Harley, the last remaining U.S.
maker of motorcycles.
   The group currently holds 6.24 percent of Harley's stock.
   There has been speculation that Glazer, who has made takeover
bids for other companies in the past, might launch a bid for Harley.
   Harley responded to Wednesday's announcement by reiterating its
intention to remain independent.
   ``The company is not for sale,'' spokeswoman Katherine Holaday
said from Harley's Milwaukee office.
   She said Harley has had no contact from Glazer or his group, and
she added, ``I think at this point any speculation about (a
possible takeover bid) would certainly be premature.''
   Harley stock was unchanged at $40.75 a share in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading Wednesday.
   Glazer's group announced on Oct. 2 it had accumulated 6.24
percent of Harley stock. Under federal law, an investor must apply
for clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to acquire a stake
of 15 percent or more in a company.
   Last year, Glazer bought 9.9 percent of Formica Corp.'s stock
and offered to buy the entire company. His overtures were rejected
and a management-led group subsequently took Formica private.
   Glazer is chairman of First Allied Corp., which he said has
interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states, including
television stations, real estate, health care and banking. He said
the company has assets of more than $200 million.

<HEAD>Union Leader in Boeing Strike Criticized as Too Cozy With Company</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM KLASS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With his dapper suits, executive salary and swank
office equipped with a kitchen and shoe-polish machine, Tom Baker
seems an unlikely leader of the knock-down, drag-out machinists
strike against Boeing Co.
   Since becoming president of District Lodge 751, International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers in 1980, Baker has
been criticized by dissidents in the aerospace giant's largest
union for what they call his coziness with management.
   At age 52, a rural Arkansas native who went from seaman to
Boeing electronics technician before making organized labor his
career, he was far from itching to strike.
   Nonetheless, he recommended rejection of a three-year contract
matching or exceeding most major recent settlements nationally. A
strike was approved on an 85 percent vote Oct. 3.
   ``Sometimes it takes a strike to get what you want, but if there
is a long strike, some people can wind up suffering,'' Baker said.
``That's the part I don't like.''
   The offer included 4 percent raises the first year and 3 percent
in each of the next two years, productivity bonuses of 8 percent of
gross pay the first year and 3 percent the second year, less
mandatory overtime and more benefits.
   Union members, whose tasks range from riveting to delicate
instrument calibrations, were making $17,534 to $37,377 a year
before the strike.
   Doug Hammond, a federal mediator who assisted in pre-strike
contract negotiations, couldn't predict the outcome of the strike
vote by 40,000 union members. Baker was certain.
   ``He really has a feel for the people he represents,'' Hammond
said.
   Dissident Franklin E. Knowles, 51, a toolmaker and 24-year union
member from Everett, Wash., emphasized that despite his criticisms
of Baker, ``I never said he was stupid.''
   Baker's predecessor, Albert Wydick, led the last strike against
Boeing, a 45-day walkout in 1977. In 1980 Wydick withdrew from an
election battle with Baker in exchange for a better paying, less
stressful union job.
   ``I do not believe he had the basic abilities that Tom Baker has
... the savvy, the intelligence,'' Knowles said.
   Favoring natty three-piece suits, sporting an impeccably trimmed
mustache and carefully coiffed silver hair, soft-spoken and
cautious, Baker was the first to win three consecutive terms of
what is now the largest of IAM's 162 district lodges without a
ballot opponent.
   ``I think he really typifies the local leadership'' of the
Machinists nationwide, said Machinists president George Kourpias.
   ``He's a good administrator,'' Kourpias said. ``He's also a good
leader. He has brought some stability to that district lodge.''
   Critics say Baker has artfully ensured that only his supporters
were elected to the District Council. Only council members, chosen
from the district's seven locals, may run for president.
   Tom Finnegan, a machine operator and 35-year Boeing employee in
Auburn, Wash., who lost his District Council seat to a Baker
supporter, said the president would have lost had he faced ballot
opposition.
   Even with the strike, Finnegan said, ``a lot of people figure
he's just too cozy with the company.''
   Anti-Baker leaflets circulated through Boeing plants last year
titled ``Truth Not Trivia'' zeroed in on a 17.5 percent increase in
base salary for Baker in 1987, lavish travel spending and the $9.4
million spent on ``Baker's Taj Mahal,'' a brick-and-glass edifice
featuring a soaring glass atrium that opened in July a few blocks
from Boeing headquarters.
   The president's suite includes a fully equipped kitchen, a
conference table and easel, a row of model Boeings on a shelf, an
electric rotary shoe buffer, couch, easy chairs and coffee table.
   Baker, who received $75,343 in salary and per diem and $27,546
for expenses last year for a total compensation of $102,889,
dismissed critics as petty carpers ``who don't stand for
something.''
   The building replaced a 40-year-old cramped and outmoded union
hall, and an image of ``permanence and strength'' was essential, he
asserted.
   Rarely does Baker raise his voice, even at times like a visit to
the picket line outside Boeing headquarters the day the strike
began.
   Wearing a blue union sweatshirt over jeans and white athletic
shoes, he waved his picket sign high, grinning.
   As head of the 43,300 Boeing machinists in the Seattle area _
nearly four-fifths of the 57,800 workers represented by the union
nationwide _ Baker has visited the picket lines daily.
   He has a Boeing family. Two sons, ages 30 and 28, are on strike,
as is his 25-year-old daughter and two of their spouses. The
younger son's wife, a salaried employee at Boeing, remains on the
job.
   In even tones bearing unmistakeable traces of the Ozark
Mountains, Baker described a rural childhood of hardship.
   He was born in Harrison, Ark., but the family moved to the
Bakersfield, Calif., area when he was young. His father worked on
irrigation systems and picked cotton. Baker later joined his father
in the fields, cramming in schoolwork between seasons.
   In about the fifth or sixth grade, he contracted rheumatic fever
and the family returned to Arkansas because his parents thought it
would improve his health. He later completed high school there and
joined the Navy.
   ``When they said, `We'll give you a free airplane ticket,' I
said, `I'm yours,'' he recalled.
   After four years at sea, where he began working with
electronics, he found work at Boeing, mostly dealing with ballistic
missile circuitry and control systems.
   ``The union was not something I had given any thought to, but I
happened to hit a shop that was well-organized ... with good,
strong exposure to union people,'' he said.
   In about 1959 he became a shop steward and eventually went on to
become a local president and a business representative.
   In his first campaign for district president, he joined a
groundswell of feeling that incumbent Wydick was weak.
   Three years later Baker clashed with Justin Ostro, an IAM vice
president who coordinates aerospace industry negotiations, over a
contract offer that _ for the first time _ sacrificed wage
increases in favor of bonuses.
   Ostro urged members to reject the contract. Baker said vote yes.
The members followed Baker.
   In 1986, despite a determined union effort to return to
increases in basic wage rates, a narrowly approved contract
provided only another round of bonuses.
   This year, citing an extensive survey showing 62 percent of
Boeing workers wanted wage gains, Baker made the issue a contract
demand.
   Kourpias dismissed Baker's past clashes with the international
leadership, or Grand Lodge and asserted hehad worked closely with
him ``from the day he was elected.''
   Kourpias also said Baker would be a strong candidate for a
higher position within the parent union, but Baker said he's not
interested.
   ``I think this job is really a better job than the vice
president's job in the (parent) union. Here I can make things
happen,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pork Belly Market Surges As Supplies Decline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Frozen pork belly futures prices climbed sharply Wednesday on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, boosted by stronger cash markets,
shrinking supplies and bullish technical signals.
   On other commodity markets, livestock, energy and precious
metals were mostly higher while grain futures were mixed.
   Frozen pork bellies settled 1.10 cents to 1.22 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in February at 47.72 cents a pound. The
rally erased most of the losses piled up in the three previous
sessions.
   Pork belly prices have been recovering slowly since early
September after sliding to 18-year lows during the summer as
supplies piled up in warehouses, a function of declining
consumption of bacon, which is made from pork bellies.
   The government's decision to include pork bellies in food aid to
Poland helped get the market moving again last month, as did a drop
in retail bacon prices to levels that some consumers apparently
found irresistible.
   On Sept. 22, the Agriculture Department reported a record
45.4-million-pound drop in frozen pork belly stocks from Aug. 1 to
Sept. 1, to 50 million pounds. More recent statistics indicate the
stockpile continues to shrink.
   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday reported a
2.4-million-pound decline last week in bellies stored in warehouses
outside of Chicago.
   ``As much as anything, the bellies are getting energy from
fairly good out-movement,'' said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with
AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill.
   Meanwhile, the dry, sunny weather of the past month has kept
many pork producers focused on harvesting corn and soybeans instead
of marketing hogs, temporarily reducing hog supplies and forcing
meatpackers to pay more for the animals and charge more for pork
products.
   This kink in the pork pipeline is a seasonal phenomenon but
``it's kind of extraordinary this year,'' Durchholz said, because
the harvesting weather has been unusually good.
   Another analyst, Dale Benson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago, said the rally was also linked to technical buy signals,
especially the February contract's dip below 47 cents a pound,
which triggered large-scale buying.
   On the livestock markets, live cattle futures settled .10 cent
to .35 cent higher with October at 73.20 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .20 cent to .60 cent higher with October at 83.15 cents
a pound; live hogs were .30 cent lower to .40 cent higher with
October at 47.62 cents a pound.
   Energy futures prices settled mostly higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in a session dominated by technical factors.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 10 cents lower to 8
cents higher with November at $20.25 a barrel; heating oil was .11
cent to .22 cent higher with November at 59.81 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .26 cent lower to .67 cent higher with

   Gold futures were slightly higher while silver made substantial
gains on New York's Commodity Exchange. Analysts said silver was

   Gold finished 90 cents to $1 higher with October at $362 a troy
ounce; silver was 4.3 cents to 5 cents higher with December at

   Most soybean and corn futures advanced slightly on the Chicago
Board of Trade as traders fine-tuned their positions ahead of
Thursday's Agriculture Department crop report.
   Most wheat futures posted modest losses, reflecting a lack of
new export demand.
   The USDA crop report, scheduled for release after Thursday's

harvests than the USDA's September estimates of 1.89 billion
bushels of soybeans and 7.32 billion bushels of corn.

<HEAD>May Selling Caldor Chain To Investor Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   May Department Stores Co. said Wednesday it has
sold its 118 Caldor discount stores to an investor group that
includes senior management and is spinning off its Venture discount
chain in order to concentrate on its higher-return and
faster-growing businesses.
   May, one of the nation's leading department store companies,
said Wednesday it had agreed to sell Caldor for $500 million cash
and $52 million in other considerations to CAL Holdings Inc.
   CAL Holdings is a new company formed by Odyssey Partners, L.P.;
Caldor management led by Don R. Clarke, chairman and chief
executive officer, Marc I. Balmuth, president, and others; and
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Capital Corp.
   CAL Holdings will assume $52 million in Caldor debt and
capitalized lease operations, May spokesman Jim Abrams said.
   Caldor is located primarily in the Northeast.
   May, which has been trying to sell its two discount operations
for several months, also announced a plan to spin off its Venture
division of 75 discount stores in eight states in the Midwest.
   Plans, which are subject to a favorable ruling by the Internal
Revenue Service, call for Venture to borrow money, which it then
would pay to May as compensation for separating itself from May.
   May would distribute stock in Venture to its shareholders,
Abrams said.
   ``We have done what we said we were going to do in late June,''
Abrams said. He said he could not place a dollar value on the
Venture spinoff.
   Analysts, however, estimate that the Venture move will raise
$300 million, which they expect May to use for further acquisitions
in the retail field.
   Linda Kristiansen of Dean Witter said she had expected the
Caldor and Venture moves to provide money for future expansion.
   ``I'm a little disappointed in the proceeds, which should total
$850 million,'' Kristiansen said. ``I expected it to come to about
$1.2 billion, but it doesn't change anything. Clearly, they'll be
in a position to make the ... acquisitions.''
   May said it does not currently have a specific use for the money
from the transactions, but it is considering adding more department
stores or specialty stores, repurchasing shares of its stock, or
using the money for other corporate purposes.
   Besides Caldor and Venture, May owns 14 department store chains
in 29 states and the District of Columbia and 2,663 Payless shoe
stores in the Northeast.

   The man who will become Procter &amp; Gamble Co.'s
chairman on Jan. 2 said Wednesday he expects the company to win a
bigger share of international business and hopes employees increase
their stake in the company.
   ``We now think of ourselves as a world company. That's an
important cultural change for P&amp;G,'' said Edwin L. Artzt, who also
will assume the post of chief executive of the Cincinnati-based
company. ``We've discovered in the past 10 years that the product
strategies employed here really can work in other places around the
world.''
   P&amp;G says its employees, including retirees, own 24 percent of
the company's stock, much of it through profit-sharing programs.
Artzt said employee ownership, along with P&amp;G's financial health
and anti-takeover measures it has taken, can help guard against
takeover attempts.
   Artzt said P&amp;G would like to see its employees' holdings grow.
But, regarding concerns about takeovers, he said, ``I think the
best thing a company can do is satisfy its shareholders, and we're
trying to do that.''
   Artzt, 59, who joined Procter &amp; Gamble in 1953 and has spent the
past five years directing P&amp;G's international operations, said the
company hopes to do half its business in overseas markets at some
point during the 1990s. He told a news conference Wednesday he
thinks that goal could grow further.
   About 39 percent of P&amp;G's sales in the last fiscal year were
based outside the United States.
   P&amp;G announced to its shareholders' meeting Tuesday that Artzt
will take over Jan. 2 for John G. Smale, who will step down as
chairman and chief executive _ but continue as an employee and
director _ to spend more time with his family. Smale, 62, has been
with P&amp;G since 1952.
   Artzt said Smale first approached him with the idea early this
summer.
   ``I was pleasantly surprised,'' Artzt said. ``It was never my
expectation that John would step aside at this point, even though
some of our executives have done that.
   ``From my standpoint, it's quite a wonderful thing that he would
step aside and give me a chance to lead this company,'' Artzt said.
   John E. Pepper, 51, will continue as P&amp;G's president, but will
relinquish most of his responsibility for domestic operations in
return for succeeding Artzt as supervisor of international
operations. Artzt praised Pepper as a highly capable manager.
   ``I feel very good about having him in what I regard as the
second most important job in the company,'' Artzt said. He
suggested that Pepper could have a future shot at the chairman's
job.
   ``It's my time to step up to bat,'' Artzt said. ``John's in a
different generation than I am. He'll be around after my days are
over.''
   Artzt said he has no plans now to step aside early, as Smale is
doing.
   Artzt also said he expects to make no dramatic changes in the
company's direction.
   ``Our leader is stepping aside, but we intend to continue the
program that seems to be doing so well,'' Artzt said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, a personal-care and home products company,
earned a company record $1.6 billion on record worldwide sales of
$21.4 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30.

   Bank of New England Corp., citing unfavorable tax
laws and a desire to concentrate its business closer to home,
announced Wednesday it would discuss selling part of its leasing
business to the Bank of Tokyo.
   The bank said it had entered a preliminary agreement to
negotiate for a short period of time with the Bank of Tokyo.
   The Bank of New England said in a statement that no final
agreement has been reached, and any further comments would be
inappropriate.
   The company said it is contemplating the sale because federal
tax law changes have made the leasing business less attractive, and
because the bank's leasing business is concentrated outside New
England.
   The bank said it had adopted an earlier strategy to concentrate
resources in the New England region.

   Beverly Enterprises Inc. announced
Wednesday that it has reached an agreement in principle to sell 18
of its nursing homes in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area for $32
million.
   The deal is the latest in a series begun early last year when
Beverly, the nation's largest owner of nursing homes, said it would
restructure by selling unprofitable businesses. The company has
been struggling with a nearly $1 billion load of debt.
   The Minnesota nursing homes, with a total of 1,998 beds, will be
sold to a group of investors who have retained Health Dimensions
Inc. of Cambridge, Minn., as managers. Beverly did not identify the
investors. The sale is expected to be completed later this year.
   Included in the $32 million is $14 million that Nationwide
Health Properties Inc. will receive for the sale of four homes that
are leased to Beverly.
   Once all its sales are completed, Beverly said its beds will
total 68,445, compared to 115,357 when the restructuring began.
   Beverly, the nation's largest owner of nursing homes, has a
workforce of more than 100,000 at facilities in 38 states and the
District of Columbia.

<HEAD>Third Quarter Profit Increases 14 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CPC International Inc. reported
Wednesday that its earnings increased 14 percent in the third
quarter, due in part to growth in the company's consumer food and
corn refining businesses.
   Earnings rose to $87.2 million, or $1.13 a share, for the three
months ended Sept. 30 compared with $76.7 million, or 98 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   Worldwide sales increased 5.8 percent in the quarter to $1.29
billion from $1.22 billion in the period last year.
   ``We are very gratified by the earnings improvement achieved in
the third quarter especially in view of the fact that CPC's
European operations overcame the adverse effects of lower dollar
values of their currencies,'' chairman and chief executive officer
James. R. Eiszner said in a statement.
   For the first nine months of 1989, CPC's net income increased 15
percent to $238 million, or $3.05 per share, from $206.7 million,
or $2.62 a share, during the same nine-month period in 1988.
   Nine-month worldwide sales rose to $3.8 billion from $3.5
billion a year earlier.
   CPC's worldwide consumer foods business accounts for about 80
percent of the company's total sales. It is one of the largest
international food companies in the United States.

<DATELINE>SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. on Wednesday reported
higher sales and earnings for the third quarter compared to a year
ago.
   Earnings for the three months ending Sept. 30 totaled $89
million, or 69 cents a share, compared with $87 million, or 67
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales totaled $2.41 billion, up 20
percent from $2.01 billion in the same period of 1988.
   Nine-month earnings totaled $366 million, or $2.82 a share, up
from $321 million, or $2.48 a share, in the 1988 period. Sales for
the first nine months rose to $6.97 billion from $6.06 billion last
year.
   The 1989 figures reflect a pre-tax provision of about $43
million to cover anticipated costs of a voluntary severance program
announced earlier this month and a decrease in the estimated 1989
full-year tax rate, Motorola said in a statement.
   ``We are encouraged by the continuing strong demand for our
communications products, where we have had more than 40 years of
uninterrupted sales growth,'' said Chairman Robert W. Galvin.
   The company, based in this Chicago suburb, also reported an
increase in worldwide demand for its two-way radios, pagers and
radio data systems.
   New products introduced during the past three months included a
Wrist Watch Pager, which combines a numeric display pager with a
digital watch.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `Half of ...,' to CLARIFY that Toyota already

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S. manufacturing capacity
must increase by two-thirds to meet American sales expectations, a
company official said Wednesday.
   The boost in capacity would come at time that other automakers
are struggling with too much factory capability.
   Ford Motor Co. is cutting back on overtime at its plants and
General Motors Corp. has announced that it will close its Lakewood
assembly plant in Atlanta this coming March.
   Chrysler Corp. has not ruled out plant closings.
   Bob McCurry, executive vice president for sales of Toyota Motor
Sales, USA Inc., said he expected the company would sell 1.5
million cars and trucks a year in the United States by the
mid-1990s.
   Half of that sales volume would come from North American plants.
Toyota makes cars at its plants in Georgetown, Ky., and Cambridge,
Ontario, and at a plant in Fremont, Calif., that it shares with GM.
Toyota plans to add light truck production to the Fremont plant by
next year.
   The plants' current capacity for Toyota is about 450,000
vehicles a year, meaning that capacity for another 300,000 vehicles
is needed.
   McCurry, speaking at Toyota's media introduction of its 1990
model cars and trucks, said production at existing plants could be
expanded to handle the extra 300,000, mostly through the Georgetown
and Fremont plants.
   ``It's possible,'' said analyst Kathleen Heaney of Nikko
Securities Co. International Inc. of New York City. ``They are
going to do two things _ they are targeting the Midwest and the
fleet market. They can make a big move into that area.''
   A year ago, McCurry said the company was embarking on a program
to expand its dealer network in the Midwest, an area of the country
resistant to Japanese cars and trucks. On Wednesday, he said the
program was working.
   McCurry said there are about 1,125 Toyota dealers nationwide
now, and the company will have add 55 in the Midwest by year's end.
Another 55 are expected to be added in the region next year.
   McCurry said the company had established dealerships in most
Midwest metropolitan areas and was heading out of the cities to
find new dealers.
   Like other auto company executives, McCurry predicted a slower
sales year in 1990 than in 1989, with somewhere between 14 million
and 14.5 million cars and trucks being sold _ 500,000 to 1 million
fewer vehicles than estimates for the 1989 calendar year.
   He also said that 1990 Toyota prices would be 2.1 percent on
average more than 1989 prices. The increase, McCurry said, was due
entirely to federally mandated passive restraint systems _ driver's
side air bags or automatic seat belts.

<DATELINE>DAYTON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mead Corp. said Wednesday it set a record
with $1.19 billion in revenue for the quarter ending Oct. 1, but
its earnings for the period declined by more than half compared
with the same quarter last year.
   The revenue figure includes gains from the company's sale in
September of its Release Products Division for $15.5 million.
   Earnings for the third quarter totaled $69.7 million, or $1.06 a
share, compared with earnings of $170.5 million, or $2.56 a share,
for the same quarter last year. Last year's figure included a
$100.9 million gain from the August 1988 sale of a 50 percent stake
in the Brunswick Pulp &amp; Paper Co. of Brunswick, Ga.
   Without the one-time gain, the paper products and electronic
publishing company had comparable earnings of $69.6 million, or
$1.06 a share, for last year's third quarter. Third-quarter revenue
in 1988 totaled $1.17 billion.
   For the first nine months of 1989, Mead reported earnings of
$184.5 million, or $2.83 per share, including the divestiture gain.
Without the gain, those figures would have been $169 million, or
$2.60 per share.
   For the comparable three quarters of 1988, Mead had earnings of
$309.3 million, or $4.69 per share. Excluding the divestiture
gains, its earnings were $197.2 million, or $3.02 per share.
   Mead said plans to open a $550 million specialty paper mill near
Phenix City, Ala., in late 1990.
   ``We foresee continued strong demand for our products through
the fourth quarter, although capacity increases in such areas as
uncoated paper and paperboard have resulted in some softening of
prices,'' Chairman Burnell R. Roberts said.

   MCorp, a troubled bank holding company, said

Ohio-based banking company.
   MCorp said it agreed to sell MVestment Corp. to Cleveland-based

$105 million in cash and a $15 million note.
   The board of directors of MCorp, which has been in Chapter 11

will submit it for bankruptcy court approval. The sale also is
subject to regulatory approval.
   ``The decision to sell MVestment was based on our duty to

shareholders and other constituencies,'' Gene H. Bishop, MCorp's
chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   ``We also believe that MVestment under Ameritrust will be in
excellent position to build further on its successful record.''
   Ameritrust owns regional banks in Ohio and Indiana and, through
its banking offices, operates trust departments across the country.
   Dallas-based MVestment, with 725 employees in 10 Texas cities,
reported pre-tax operating income of $13.7 million on $46 million
in revenues for the first nine months of this year.
   MVestment, which holds $17.1 billion in trust and custody
assets, consists of four operating companies: MTrust, MPetroleum,
MRealty and MSecurities.
   MCorp operates five MBanks in Brownsville, Corpus Christi, El

   Zenith Data Systems, the soon-to-be-sold
computer division of Zenith Electronics Corp., unveiled four new
personal computers Wednesday, including the industry's first
battery-powered laptop model based on the powerful Intel 80386SX

   Zenith, the world's largest seller of battery-powered laptop
computers, said the new 12.1-pound SupersPort SX laptop _ which
weighs 16.8 pounds with its battery _ could operate for more than
three hours on the battery before it needs recharging.
   The model will be available with a 3.5-inch floppy disc drive
and either a 40 megabyte or 100 megabyte hard-disc drive at a
suggested retail price of about $6,800 and $7,400, respectively.
   Spokesman Matt Mirapaul said Japan's Toshiba and NEC also make
laptop-size computers based on the 386SX microprocessor but neither
runs on a battery.
   Glenview-based Zenith also introduced a desktop workstation
based on the 386SX microprocesser, a faster version of its
TurbosPort 386 laptop with an improved display and a faster version
of its SupersPort 286 laptop with improved display.
   Zenith announced Oct. 2 it had agreed to sell its computer
operations to France's Groupe Bull for up to $635 million.
   The sale will leave Zenith with its consumer electronics
business. Zenith is the last major U.S.-based television
manufacturer.
